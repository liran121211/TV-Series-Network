1
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,700
The star fell, Bull.

2
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,440
That is no ordinary star.

3
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,670
That is the tear of a warrior.

4
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,940
What is a warrior?

5
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,710
One who has finished his battle
somewhere on this planet…

6
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,580
A pitiful soul that could not
believe in the Great Spirit…

7
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,720
The report from Callisto went
directly to Sir Vicious.

8
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,220
He is requesting a deal for Red-Eye.

9
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,960
30,000 Woolongs per gram.
A total of 7500 grams.

10
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,070
Why did he specify you as the dealer?

11
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,670
He is a Titan veteran.
We were in the same unit.

12
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,510
Why does he rely on you now?

13
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,340
Callisto is undergoing
a depression right now.

14
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,720
If he can’t see the future,
he is sure to worry.

15
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,650
All the more reason to keep
our hands out of that moon.

16
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,220
Vicious, are you not
the one that is worrying?

17
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,100
You have no permission to
make your own decisions.

18
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,400
Regardless of who it is, those who go
against the Van’s will are punished.

19
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,030
You believe that I would
betray my own mentor?

20
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,670
Mao’s case was merely bad luck.

21
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,510
Lin… You shall go with Vicious.

22
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,880
Yes.

23
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,970
Wang Long!

24
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,820
Callisto is a frigid planet.

25
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,550
Take plenty of winter clothes.

26
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,890
To me, no cold climate is
worth taking precautions for.

27
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,090
It is true that the planet
is warmer than your heart.

28
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,370
Your heart is colder
than a snake’s skin.

29
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,200
Vicious.

30
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,850
A snake cannot eat a dragon.

31
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,530
I will be fine by myself.

32
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,000
I’ll go with you.

33
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,260
Remember this.

34
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,600
If you want to survive,
you must betray me at times.

35
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,160
No, never.

36
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,610
That would go against the Van’s will.

37
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,130
Such old-fashioned thinking
makes me nauseous.

38
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,380
Those damn corpses!

39
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,310
I will protect you,
for the honor of the Red Dragon.

40
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,810
Honor, huh?

41
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,620
Then, it’s up to me
to slaughter them all!

42
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,290
JUPITER JAZZ (Part I)

43
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,490
It’s hot…

44
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,030
Where are the others?

45
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,570
What a depressing bunch…

46
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,280
What’s with this humidity?

47
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,280
It’s so muggy that I can’t sleep!

48
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,620
Oh, it’s just a breakdown.

49
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,710
It’d be hard for me to do
if I saw your faces…

50
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,320
…so I’m leaving without seeing you one
last time. Please don’t look for me.

51
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,830
That wench…

52
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,730
She sucked out all the
antifreeze from the radiator.

53
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,200
It’ll be out for at least half a day.

54
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,430
Even if she didn’t pull this stunt
we wouldn’t look for her. Right?

55
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,510
She emptied out the safe as well.

56
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,040
7, 8, 9… hello!

57
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,420
Are you really looking for Faye?

58
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,220
1, 0, 1, 1, goodbye!

59
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,690
Are you just wasting time?

60
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,660
Is there anything else to do right now?

61
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,460
—Ooh! Boom!
—You found her?!

62
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,530
I wonder who this is…

63
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,470
Lesse… code name…

64
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,930
Julia!

65
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,230
Where is that coming from?!

66
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,570
Lesse…

67
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,110
Pretty close…

68
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,670
Looks like Blue Crow on Callisto…

69
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,970
Where’s it going to?

70
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,180
It got disconnected…

71
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,120
Hey!

72
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,620
But…

73
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,850
Actually, there are no
girls in Blue Crow.

74
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,690
Honestly…

75
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,160
Hey, Spike…

76
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,660
Is that it?

77
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,840
Hey!

78
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,140
Hey, wait, Spike!

79
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,400
That’s a common woman’s name!

80
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,970
What about Faye?

81
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,350
Leave her.

82
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,080
This is a lawless area.

83
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,880
A woman surely can’t survive
wandering about all alone!

84
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,110
Feeling sympathetic?

85
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,780
Plenty of sympathy…
for the money she ran away with!

86
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,960
Spike!

87
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,200
I’m gonna go look.

88
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,390
What?

89
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,200
I’m gonna look for my woman.

90
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,110
You can look for that other woman.

91
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,600
You’re gonna have nothing
to do with this?

92
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,370
That’s right. We only go so far.

93
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,710
Even if you come back, there
won’t be a place for you here.

94
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,920
Can’t do anything about it.

95
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,120
I’m sure you’re not as lonely now
that you have more strange roommates.

96
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,590
Me?

97
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,760
You stayed here just for that reason?

98
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,390
You’re being stupid!

99
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,490
It’s been three years
since I teamed up with you.

100
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,400
But I never knew you
looked at me that way!

101
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,770
I was under the impression
that you were the lonely one!

102
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,640
Well we got rid of
that misunderstanding.

103
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,840
Good riddance!!
Now we’ll have more money for food!

104
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,250
I never did understand you,
even to the very end!

105
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,340
I don’t understand, either.

106
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,920
So long!

107
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,200
I don’t know any woman.

108
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,140
Like I would know!

109
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,340
Not even a rumor?

110
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,850
I have no luck with ’em!

111
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,480
I’d rather be with an armadillo!

112
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,640
Have you heard of the name Julia?

113
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,750
You shoulda said so earlier!

114
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,990
There’s one in front of
Tony’s place every night!

115
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,930
Excuse me! I’m not Julia.

116
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,630
Ju-li-us! I’m Julius!

117
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,630
Oh, I see…

118
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,070
Hey, you’re my type.

119
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,800
Wanna hang out with me tonight?

120
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,830
I’m sorry, I already have plans.

121
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,840
Oh, yeah. Gren might know something…

122
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,750
I’ve seen him with a woman before.

123
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,910
Gren?

124
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,080
It’s cold.

125
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,780
Looks like this is it for tonight.

126
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,120
Oh, a customer?

127
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,220
Not even. Can’t you tell he’s straight?

128
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,090
Come on, let’s switch locations.

129
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,150
Hey, who and where is Gren?

130
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,600
So you wanna hang out with me tonight?

131
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,570
He’s a sax player in Blue Crow.

132
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,850
Take care.

133
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,920
That was close.

134
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,830
When someone sneezes
and doesn’t get told…

135
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,390
…to take care, that
person becomes a fairy…

136
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,090
That’s what they say around here.

137
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,760
Then it’s okay.

138
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,960
I’m already a fairy.

139
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,270
I’m not as easy as I appear to be.

140
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,120
Unfortunately, I am not
interested in women…

141
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,780
Oh, that’s a shame…

142
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,880
But the others seem to
be highly interested.

143
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,820
You didn’t know that there
were no women in this town?

144
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,290
So I’ll be very popular…

145
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,670
You should watch out…

146
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,510
Thanks for the warning.

147
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,420
I’m searching for something…

148
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,150
There’s nothing here.

149
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,130
The only things are stale bread,
a broken-down car, and rancid booze.

150
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,160
I’m looking for a guy named Gren.

151
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,000
No idea.

152
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,730
I see.

153
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,390
Hey, you need something?

154
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,030
You’re Vicious, right?

155
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:19,900
Me?!

156
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,330
Where’s the money?

157
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,140
If ya don’t put out,
it won’t do ya any good!

158
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,750
This is annoying…

159
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,750
So annoying it’s repulsive!

160
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,710
What the hell do you mean?!

161
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,450
Why the hell am I Vicious?

162
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,690
There was info that there was
gonna be some deal for Red-Eye.

163
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,880
From Gren to Vicious.

164
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,620
I thought of taking that cash…

165
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,700
You think I look like I got money?

166
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,670
Foreigners are all rich.

167
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,370
And the code name was Julia?

168
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,740
Heh… Sure sounds like
some easy wench’s name!

169
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,110
Yeah… really.

170
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,720
Gimme a Cowboy.

171
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,310
There are no bounties around here.

172
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,860
Bourbon with milk.

173
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,660
Oh, That Cowboy. I knew that.
You can’t possibly be a bounty-hunter.

174
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,400
<i>So, who’s our customer today?</i>

175
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,770
<i>Grencia Mars Elijah Guo Eckener.</i>

176
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,070
<i>That’s a long name!</i>

177
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,160
<i>Yeah. He escaped from military,</i>
<i>prison three years ago…</i>

178
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,270
<i>…and the statute of limitations</i>
<i>is about to expire.</i>

179
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,170
<i>…and that means?</i>

180
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,340
<i>The bounty is double!</i>

181
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,450
<i>This is a chance you can’t miss!</i>

182
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,110
<i>But I kinda feel like</i>
<i>we can let him go…</i>

183
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,350
<i>Judy, what are you saying?</i>

184
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,380
<i>He’s an escaped convict!</i>

185
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,960
<i>But Punch…</i>

186
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,760
<i>He’s very handsome!</i>

187
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,830
<i>Just look at his picture!</i>

188
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,760
<i>Lesse… Oh, come on…</i>

189
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,730
<i>I’m much more handsome than he is…</i>

190
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,260
<i>Punch, I just can’t</i>
<i>laugh at that joke…</i>

191
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,830
Hey, can you turn that thing off?!

192
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,930
Well, calm down.

193
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,600
I’m sorry, man.

194
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,340
Don’t worry. That guy passed
out over there is a cop.

195
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,970
What do ya wanna say?

196
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,820
Actually, there’s a
bounty on my head, too.

197
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,190
This place is a hideout
for people like that.

198
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,150
I see…

199
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,490
So you can rest assured.

200
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,720
Me?

201
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,830
What’s with this?

202
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,500
I wanted to get rid of all this
frustration, and nobody’s coming?

203
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,140
Oh… you’re all here.

204
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,350
Miss, your appearance is
rather harmful to the eyes.

205
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,440
Or are you enticing us?

206
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,920
Yeah, I am…

207
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,910
Hold on a minute.

208
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,850
If I don’t do this, I’ll chip a nail…

209
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,330
Okay, any time now!

210
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,090
You wench!

211
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,300
Hurry!

212
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,830
Why did you bring me here?

213
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,930
Because you said you’re a fairy.

214
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,530
Why did you come with me?

215
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,940
’Cuz I got no place to stay.

216
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,910
You can trust me that easily?

217
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,470
You said you weren’t
interested in women.

218
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,040
I might take your money and kill you…

219
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,890
That’s fine.

220
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,390
I’ve lived longer than I seem.

221
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,860
It’s broken.

222
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,310
You came to such a slummy
neighborhood all by yourself?

223
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,610
I’m alone.

224
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,580
I don’t want comrades…

225
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,910
…and it’s not worth having any…

226
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,540
I end up worrying about
things I don’t have to…

227
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,850
You know, ’cuz I’m
such a good woman…

228
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,190
All the guys end up fighting for me.

229
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,720
They often say that humans
can’t live alone…

230
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,030
But you can live pretty
long by yourself.

231
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,240
Instead of feeling alone in a group…

232
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,710
…it’s better to be alone
in your solitude.

233
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,350
When I’m dealing with them,
it’s nothing but trouble…

234
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,580
And I don’t get squat out of it…

235
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,490
So it doesn’t matter if
I’m there or not…

236
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,450
You just got scared of losing them.

237
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,430
So you distanced yourself from them.

238
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,830
You’re weird.

239
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,240
Think so?

240
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,270
I don’t know why I’m
talking to you about this…

241
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,510
I feel like I’m in a confessional…

242
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,750
Have you ever had
experience as a minister?

243
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,740
No…

244
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,990
Take care.

245
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,670
You want to take a shower?

246
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,970
No thanks.

247
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,700
I don’t know where
peeping toms might be…

248
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,410
You shouldn’t peek, either.

249
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,740
Hm, I can’t guarantee that.

250
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,430
<i>Gren… You’re not there?</i>

251
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,160
Vicious?!

252
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,170
<i>I’m out with “honroutou”.</i>

253
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:37,800
<i>Along with the “mangan” and the</i>
<i>“ura-dora”, it’s 32000. I’ll be waiting.</i>

254
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,050
Are you dating Julia behind my back?

255
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,020
Sir Spike!

256
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,720
Hey, Lin. You’ve gotten pretty big.

257
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,220
He used to work under you,
but things are different now.

258
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,790
I feel sorry for her. Having her name
used for some crooked deal like this.

259
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,030
You were always the one
leaving others out of the loop.

260
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,410
We still haven’t settled
the score from earlier.

261
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,740
Any time.

262
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,210
Lin!

263
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,990
Get out of the way, Lin!

264
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,730
Julia was here, in this town.

265
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,060
Hey, out of the way, Lin!

266
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,130
Lin…

267
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,050
A woman?

268
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,420
W-Which are you?

269
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,730
I am both, but I am neither.

270
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,690
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

271
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:58,030
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

272
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,730
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

273
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:10,470
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

274
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:19,720
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

275
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,730
The real folk blues.

276
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:33,140
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

277
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:40,770

278
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,270

282
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,720
Hey… How are men and women different?

283
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,300
Hmm… I think women are hiding
more vital things than men are.

284
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,670
Yeah… but there are women
that aren’t feminine.

285
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,330
And there are men
that aren’t masculine.

286
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,800
What about those that
aren’t normally feminine…

287
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,270
…but show that side on
some chance circumstance?

288
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,330
I like that.

289
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,000
Oh?

290
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,340
I’m not talking about you.

291
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,440
Then who?

292
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,340
Maybe it’s Ed!
