1
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,060
I’m gonna go look.

2
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,300
What?

3
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,570
I’m gonna look for my woman.

4
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,730
You can look for that other woman.

5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,580
Are you dating Julia behind my back?

6
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,550
I feel like I’m in a confessional…

7
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,050
Have you ever had
experience as a minister?

8
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,090
You were always the one
leaving others out of the loop.

9
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,890
We still haven’t settled
the score from earlier.

10
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,130
Any time.

11
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,760
Lin!

12
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,970
Hey, out of the way, Lin!

13
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,170
Lin…

14
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,960
JUPITER JAZZ (Part II)

15
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,800
I was in the same unit
as Vicious on Titan.

16
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,300
You said that you
didn’t need comrades…

17
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,780
…but I’m attracted to that word.

18
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,280
To the point of tears…

19
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,190
On Titan, we were all comrades…

20
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,510
What song is that?

21
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,080
Julia…

22
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,650
That’s a good tune.

23
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,750
Would you mind if I played that tune on
my sax when I go home after all this?

24
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,440
After I came home from
the war, I was imprisoned.

25
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,170
They suspected that I was a spy.

26
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,870
I heard that Vicious
testified against me.

27
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,140
In prison, I went insane from insomnia.

28
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,240
As a result, I became a drug addict.

29
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,950
There were side effects…

30
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,790
My hormonal balance went out of whack,
and this is what happened.

31
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,290
You’re the second person to know
Vicious since I arrived here.

32
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,630
And the second that I’ve
talked about this to…

33
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,130
Why are you going to see Vicious?

34
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,800
Didn’t you just say that he framed you?

35
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,740
I want to see if he really did.

36
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,210
You’re going to die.

37
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,770
I’m not afraid to die.

38
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,800
You’re lying.

39
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,810
Either way, I won’t last much longer.

40
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,120
Why did you bring me here?

41
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,490
Perhaps I wanted to be with someone…

42
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,990
You selfishly help people,
and bring them along…

43
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,590
…and then you go off to die?

44
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,970
Are you sure it was this woman?

45
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,210
Yeah… It’s been 6 months since
I last saw a woman in the flesh…

46
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,550
…and 2 years since I saw
someone that good-looking.

47
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,020
Of course I wouldn’t make a mistake!

48
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,750
I never wanna live in this town…

49
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,490
She sat there, and was talking to Gren.

50
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,500
Julia always sat in that seat, too.

51
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,330
Julia?

52
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,240
She suddenly wandered in 2 years ago,
and disappeared before a month passed.

53
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,500
What kinda woman was she?

54
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,300
She was a real babe.

55
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,510
<i>I’m the only one that</i>
<i>can keep you alive…</i>

56
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,990
<i>And I’m the only one</i>
<i>that can kill you…</i>

57
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,260
<i>I’m only watching a dream</i>
<i>that I never awakened from.</i>

58
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,030
<i>It’s like I am watching a dream…</i>

59
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,390
<i>Be careful when you’re with that woman.</i>

60
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,160
<i>Women are all liars…</i>

61
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,370
<i>When this is over,</i>
<i>I’m getting out of all this.</i>

62
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,570
<i>And then… will you come with me?</i>

63
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,570
<i>Are you going to betray me?</i>

64
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,980
<i>They’re going to kill you…</i>

65
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,340
<i>Oh, you’re finally up.</i>

66
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,450
<i>You’ve slept too much.</i>
<i>It’s been three days.</i>

67
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,280
<i>Your left eye and right eye</i>
<i>are different colors…</i>

68
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,890
<i>My left eye sees the past…</i>

69
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,630
<i>Then what about your right eye…?</i>

70
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,420
I’m not dead…

71
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,900
Which way is west?

72
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,840
Thanks.

73
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,510
Tranquilizer, huh?
They’re mocking me…

74
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,910
Sorry, but can I ask ya something?

75
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,210
Where is a blue apartment
building called Orlando?

76
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,270
Don’t ask me! I don’t know anything!

77
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,340
Um, come on…

78
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,690
I want nothing to do with
foreigners from now on…

79
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,320
I’m just asking!

80
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,820
I’m gonna go find an honest job…

81
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,900
What the hell?

82
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,070
It’s here…

83
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,200
Hey!

84
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,270
Hey, get it together!

85
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,440
Jet?

86
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,680
What the hell are you doing?

87
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,390
What’s all this about?

88
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,620
He was one of those kinds of guys?

89
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,810
What are you saying?

90
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,850
Gren… isn’t like that.

91
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,860
Gren?

92
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,030
“Mangan”, with “ura-dora”…

93
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,700
He’s using an ancient code…

94
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,140
Julia was here… in this town.

95
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,110
<i>Yo.</i>

96
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,310
Yeah?

97
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,550
<i>Got anything?</i>

98
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,610
None.

99
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,050
<i>I got something good.</i>

100
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,580
Catch ’em yourself.

101
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,550
I know about the guy from
that code name “Julia”.

102
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,760
<i>It’s a guy named Gren.</i>

103
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,930
<i>He’s an escaped convict,</i>
<i>and has a hefty bounty on his head.</i>

104
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,930
<i>If you catch him, I’ll let you back on.</i>

105
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,670
Hello?

106
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,190
<i>I’m overhead.</i>

107
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,250
<i>Come to the roof of the</i>
<i>building closest to the sky.</i>

108
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,230
I’ll send a woman over.

109
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,780
<i>I don’t care…</i>

110
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,230
<i>Although I would have</i>
<i>liked to see you as well…</i>

111
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:38,900
You broke the Bebop, but kept
the Swordfish and Hammerhead mobile.

112
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,570
Did you leave that message
so that we’d come find you?

113
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,270
You’ve got to be kidding.

114
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,740
Were you just testing us?

115
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,750
Why did you come here?

116
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,450
I want my money back.

117
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,750
The safe…

118
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,980
…only had 20,000 in it.

119
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,720
Is that so?

120
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,820
Dummy.

121
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,160
Hey… Who is Julia?

122
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,330
Dunno… but she has
something to do with Spike.

123
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,330
That’s all I know.

124
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,660
Souvenir, souvenir, is it here yet?

125
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,640
It has an EX+ ranking. It’s real.

126
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,610
Hand it over.

127
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,350
This is the Titan Opal
that you requested.

128
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,850
Give Gren my regards.

129
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,260
You saved me from that
scorpion back then…

130
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,590
Yet you sold me out…

131
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,810
Gren?

132
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,280
Long time no see.

133
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,650
What are you up to?

134
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,950
You gave me that
music box because you…

135
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,760
…never thought I’d take
it apart and examine it?

136
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,560
You found the transmitter…

137
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,220
Julia was the one who found it.

138
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,930
She realized as soon as she
heard it was a gift from you.

139
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,800
And what about it?

140
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,100
Are you trying to kill me again?

141
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,110
We fought in the war together…
We were comrades…

142
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,590
We fought together…
on that desert battlefield…

143
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,290
I looked up to you…

144
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,030
I believed in you…

145
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,760
There is nothing there to believe.

146
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,960
Nor is there a need to believe…

147
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,640
Sir Vicious!

148
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,220
In this world…
there is nothing to believe in…

149
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,740
Vicious!

150
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,510
Lin’s soul won’t be saved since he lost
his life protecting someone like you!

151
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,310
I’m not what he was protecting!

152
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,480
He protected the rules!

153
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,740
You’re in the way!

154
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,870
Hey! Come on, get a grip!

155
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,740
Hey!

156
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,270
Where is Julia?
Where did she go?!

157
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,210
Do you know her?

158
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,520
Where is she now?

159
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,760
He hit some vital organs.

160
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:11,090
Shit, would an ambulance
come to a place like this?

161
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,540
Can you lift me up into the pod again?

162
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,370
I want to go to Titan…

163
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,540
You can’t possibly last
in your condition!

164
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,070
It would take too long!

165
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,980
I won’t last long anyway…

166
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,580
Dying during the voyage
would be a good way to go…

167
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,680
I want to return there…
one more time.

168
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,890
I want to be as close
as I can… Please…

169
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,900
I see.

170
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,440
You are Spike.

171
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,640
Julia was always talking about you…

172
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,450
That your two eyes were
of different colors…

173
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,890
That’s what she said…

174
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,390
That you get a strange feeling
when you look into his eyes…

175
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,460
What was she doing?

176
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,130
In the corner seat of the bar…

177
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,600
She always sat there while
I wasn’t paying attention…

178
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,480
She always requested the same song…

179
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,970
…and smiled.

180
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,050
Sadly… smiled.

181
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,850
What do you have?

182
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,860
<i>Nothing.</i>

183
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,330
<i>Hurry up and get in. We’re taking off.</i>

184
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,070
Julia…

185
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,270
What?

186
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,340
Mm… nothing. Just an
adult’s idle muttering.

187
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,780
Where did all of you guys go?

188
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,210
Someplace good.

189
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,550
Ed’s the only one left out!

190
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,050
I’ll tell you someday.

191
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,860
Nah, it’s okay, really.

192
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,720
You’re not being cute.

193
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,710
The star fell, Bull.

194
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,480
That is no ordinary star.

195
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,780
That is the tear of a warrior.

196
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,790
What is a warrior?

197
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,810
One who has finished his
battle somewhere on this planet…

198
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,430
A pitiful soul that could
not believe in the Great Spirit…

199
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,680
