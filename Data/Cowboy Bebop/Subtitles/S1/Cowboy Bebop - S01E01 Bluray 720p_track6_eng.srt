1
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,790
ASTEROID BLUES

2
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
Hey, Spike!

3
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,240
It’s ready!

4
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,900
I’m just about done myself.
What’s cooking?

5
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,880
Special “beef with bell peppers.”
Qing-jiao-rou-si.

6
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,380
Asimov Solensan.
This is our next target.

7
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,160
Hey, Jet…

8
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,800
He’s a high-end of the syndicate
that deals all around the asteroids.

9
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,060
About this Qing-jiao-rou-si…

10
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,570
The guy’s name is Asimov Solensan.
Weren’t you listening to me?!

11
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,200
You don’t call a meatless
“beef with bell peppers”…

12
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,070
…“beef with bell peppers”… do you?

13
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,240
Yes, you do.

14
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,540
No, you don’t!

15
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,010
You do when you’re broke!

16
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,020
What happened to the 1 million woolongs
we got as bounty from that last guy?!

17
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,310
The repair bill for
the plane you wrecked…

18
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,910
…and the repair bill
for the shop you trashed…

19
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,550
…and the medical bill
of the cop you injured…

20
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,120
Killed all the dough!

21
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,610
Three days ago, there was a shootout
between his group and an enemy syndicate.

22
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,210
He killed his own men and took off.

23
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,500
They say he’s hiding
with his woman in Tijuana.

24
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,040
That’s a place for nobodies to go.

25
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,240
Despite being a nobody,
he’s worth 2.5 million.

26
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,870
Don’t feel like it.

27
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,550
Tijuana… The beef there…

28
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,350
…is really tasty…

29
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,590
<i>“Attention, please.</i>
<i>We will soon arrive at the gate.”</i>

30
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,060
<i>“We look forward to serving you again.”</i>

31
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,710
<i>Please line up single file at</i>
<i>the tollbooth after clearing the gate.</i>

32
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,410
<i>Please pass by after switching</i>
<i>the credit sensors to debit mode.</i>

33
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,940
I’ll head over after
hitting the cops for clues.

34
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,850
<i>Then I’ll try seeing old man Bull.</i>

35
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,220
<i>Can you trust that old guy?</i>

36
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,050
Such an easygoing song.

37
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,480
Thief!

38
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,120
This again? Goddamn sonofabitch!

39
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,090
Man, you’re totally ripping me off,
but do ya realize…

40
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,490
…the reason you can
live here is because…

41
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,400
…I dug that gate with
all my might, ya hear?

42
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,710
This again.
You always say that when you lose.

43
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,050
We all dug the gate together, remember?

44
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,750
That we did.
We dug like there was no tomorrow…

45
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,188
Goddamn idiot sonofabitch!

46
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,040
Gimme a beer.

47
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,670
And I’ll have a Bloody Mary.

48
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,930
I got vodka, but unfortunately
I’m out of tomato juice.

49
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,060
I’m sure there’s one can
in the back room…

50
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,340
I’ll take a look.

51
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,120
Top-notch “Red-Eye.”

52
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,750
You’d know, as a buyer, right?

53
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,620
Can it be… “Bloody-Eye”?

54
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,880
Prove to me that it’s the real thing.

55
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,317
Keep those eyes open!

56
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,340
This is dandy,
but you got anything to eat?

57
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,160
I see…

58
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,830
The red-eyed coyote will appear
at the north end of town.

59
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,890
That is what I see.

60
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,960
A red-eyed coyote, huh…

61
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,600
You, “Swimming Bird.”

62
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,000
You shall meet a woman.

63
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,980
You shall be targeted
by that woman…

64
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,247
And then… death.

65
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,970
Again. I see.

66
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,380
“Again”?

67
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,620
I’ve already died once.
Got killed by a woman.

68
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,820
You take women too lightly.

69
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,850
Catch ya later.

70
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,474
May he be blessed by Wakantanka.

71
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,340
Presidente?
I’ll have a glass on the house.

72
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,110
Damn. Asimov sure lost his head.

73
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:48,460
No shit. We gotta do something
before the cops start moving.

74
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,430
Ya wanna leave it up to the cops?

75
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,950
He IS using those eye drops.
There’s no way we can win.

76
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,630
I’m tellin’ ya, we got nothin’ if
we don’t get that “Bloody-Eye” back.

77
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,805
But, man!

78
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,330
Hey.

79
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,600
Can you give me the specifics?

80
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,580
Man, I’m hungry…

81
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,020
You, too?

82
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,030
It’s better to leave the water running.

83
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,170
Or it’ll clog.

84
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,590
Oh, I’m sorry!

85
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,130
Thank you…

86
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,970
Um…

87
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,550
…l’f soffy.

88
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,690
Ew! I don’t want that anymore!
You can have it!

89
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,080
Lukfy!

90
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,760
I’m really sorry, honest.

91
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,730
Felt like my stomach was
going to be glued to my back.

92
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,860
Nice fighter.

93
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,370
It’s an old model.

94
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,100
She’s been with me for over ten years.

95
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,630
Looks like you’ve gotten
a lot of use out of it.

96
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,440
I travel around a lot.

97
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,000
I’m actually a wandering performer.

98
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,630
I can’t tell if you’re
for real or just joking.

99
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,260
A lot of people say that about me.

100
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,580
Been to Mars yet?

101
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,520
I was born on Mars.

102
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,990
They have everything there.

103
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,730
Unlike here, Mars has lots
of people, lots of things…

104
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,570
They must live happily there.

105
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,540
Only the rich.

106
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,160
Then I’m sure we’ll be happy there.

107
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,430
You planning on escaping to Mars?

108
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,480
Running away…
but how far can you go?
You planning on escaping to Mars?

109
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,730
Running away…
but how far can you go?

110
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,290
Who are you?

111
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,460
An old-fashioned cowboy.

112
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,670
A bounty hunter?

113
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,300
Good call.

114
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,200
You’re not going to catch us?

115
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,940
Your buddy seems to be pretty ill.

116
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,380
I don’t deal with weakened nobodies.

117
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,837
Wise decision.

118
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,900
You are the nobody!

119
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,240
Asimov! That’s enough!

120
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,090
Adios, cowboy.

121
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,546
Why did you stop me?

122
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,710
I coulda killed him in one second.

123
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,380
You’re tired.
If you do this anymore…

124
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,880
He was young and attractive.

125
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,380
I was waiting so long for
you to come pick me up.

126
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,850
I can finally escape the
low life I’ve had here.

127
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,486
I can finally live happily on Mars…

128
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,450
A nap. How peaceful.

129
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,110
I had a good dream.

130
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,050
That’s great.

131
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,890
Then you can see the rest of
that dream on the Bebop.

132
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,860
I’m giving up on this one.

133
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,330
It’s impossible to catch him.

134
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,620
There’s no way we can win.

135
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,630
When Asimov left his syndicate,
he snuck something out with him.

136
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:02,100
The top-end stuff of all the illegal
eye drops that the syndicate makes.

137
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,580
He took off with all of the drops,
so the group is in a mess.

138
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,810
They wanna catch him,
but all they get back are corpses.

139
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,040
Because Asimov is using it…

140
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,480
The eye drops known as “Bloody-Eye.”

141
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,850
They’re planning on going to Mars.

142
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,880
Mars?

143
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,950
But before that, they’ll sell this off.

144
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,970
Hmm? That’s…

145
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,240
I grabbed it from his breast pocket.

146
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,540
You… met him?

147
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,210
A nightmare.

148
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,880
He got you?

149
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,050
The red-eyed coyote will supposedly
appear at the north end of town.

150
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,122
This again? Goddamn sonofabitch!

151
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,570
Man, you’re totally rippin’ me off, but do
ya realize the reason you can eat well…

152
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,270
…around here is because I cultivated
the land with my buddies, ya hear?

153
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,540
Yeah, and that’s us.

154
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,270
That we did…

155
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,010
We planted seeds like
there was no tomorrow…

156
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,310
You were always planting “seeds”
of a different kind, though!

157
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,990
You have any Bloody Marys?

158
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,118
I only got beer.

159
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,100
I’ve got tomato juice.

160
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,190
How much?

161
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,330
300,000 woolongs.
I got 50 packs.

162
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,470
15 million woolongs, eh?

163
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,410
I’m in a hurry. I’ll find others
if you don’t want it.

164
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,850
Show me.

165
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,810
Lookin’ for this?

166
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,750
Hey, do you know what YOU are worth?

167
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,850
What?

168
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,830
Only 2.5 million woolongs.

169
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,190
You’re such a cheap guy.

170
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,720
Long time no see.

171
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,570
Since when are you a buyer?
Did you give up on bounty hunting?

172
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,200
No thrill in cheap bounties.

173
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,500
Looks like you do better as a thief.

174
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,270
Give it back.

175
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,580
Sure I will.

176
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,670
I owe you one!

177
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,890
You trust your eyes too much!
You’re not a chameleon!

178
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,060
You can’t see everywhere all at once!

179
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,510
Let’s go!

180
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,470
That way!

181
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,810
That way! That way!

182
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,250
What the hell are you?!

183
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,350
Don’t move!

184
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,830
All right, stay still!

185
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,690
Idiot!

186
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,060
We’re doomed if these break!
Be more careful!

187
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,920
Sorry to keep you waiting.

188
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,690
You’re late, Jet!

189
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,590
Oh…

190
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,594
…shit!

191
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,521
Asimov.

192
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,950
Stop! Doing any more is insane!
Don’t do it!

193
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,000
We can’t run anymore…

194
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,370
There’s no way we can get away…

195
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,510
Adios…

196
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,380
Hey, Spike, it’s ready!

197
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,280
It’s ready.

198
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,750
What’s cooking?

199
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,110
Special “beef with bell peppers.”

200
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:54,480
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

201
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,820
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

202
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:06,520
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

203
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:13,260
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

204
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:22,510
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

205
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,520
The real folk blues.

206
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:35,930
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

207
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:43,560
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

208
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,060
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

209
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:56,980
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

210
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:13,680
COMING EPISODE

211
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,140
Well, and so this program
is finally under way.
COMING EPISODE

212
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,050
Well, and so this program
is finally under way.

213
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,380
What’s the meaning of all this?

214
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,688
Next week, we’re completely changing
gears to show an anime for all ages.

215
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,250
Was it that kind of a story?

216
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,450
—Cheerful animals wreak havoc all over!
—WHAT?!

217
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,420
But Dr. Doolittle won’t
be making an appearance.

218
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,420
From little kids to the elderly,
if you love animals…

219
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,060
Hey, hold on now, Spike!

220
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,830
Everyone gather around
and watch the show!

221
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,860
Is it all right to
say stuff like that?!

222
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,130
I’m not responsible for anything!

223
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,730
But there is one favor
to ask right now.

224
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,930
Good little kids should sit far
from the TV when watching the show.

225
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,740
Come on…

226
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,120
Stand back about a kilometer.

227
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,770
STRAY DOG STRUT
Stand back about a kilometer.

228
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,100
STRAY DOG STRUT
That’s too far.

229
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,120
STRAY DOG STRUT
800 meters then?

230
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,230
800 meters then?
