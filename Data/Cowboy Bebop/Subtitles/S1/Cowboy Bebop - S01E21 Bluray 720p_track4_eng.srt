1
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,460
<i>This strange story began</i>
<i>on a blistering hot day,</i>

2
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,930
<i>I had received an unexpected mail</i>
<i>from an old acquaintance of mine…</i>

3
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,600
<i>…but the message was just this:</i>

4
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,340
<i>“Seek the sacred beast from Anzan.”</i>

5
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,640
<i>“I am at the meeting place</i>
<i>of the four gods.”</i>

6
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,690
BOOGIE WOOGIE FENG SHUI

7
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,390
<i>Pao, the sender of the message,</i>
<i>was an acquaintance of mine…</i>

8
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,130
<i>…but it didn’t mean that we</i>
<i>kept in touch all that well.</i>

9
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,660
<i>I grew suspicious, and started</i>
<i>to research Pao’s current whereabouts.</i>

10
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,440
<i>They say that Pao is one of the three</i>
<i>greatest Feng Shui masters here on Mars.</i>

11
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,210
<i>But when I found his whereabouts,</i>
<i>he had already left this world…</i>

12
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,820
Are you sure you weren’t the
one that sent me this mail?

13
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,090
The one who visits from
the inauspicious back door…

14
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,160
Receive the word from the heavens,
and lead me to the sun stone…

15
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,570
Just like what the pa-kua told me!

16
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,570
Look out!

17
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,310
Where are you shooting?!

18
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,850
They sure are disrespectful fellows.

19
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,350
The escape route!

20
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,020
Hey?

21
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,920
Hey, hey!

22
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,320
Idiot!

23
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,890
Shit!

24
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,660
Hey, hey, hey!

25
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,910
Escape route!

26
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,280
Chi of Earth!

27
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,910
That was really close!

28
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,140
I’m glad you’re safe.

29
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,790
What are you doing?

30
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,490
Hey, over there… Who is that?

31
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,470
I wonder if she’s a new girlfriend.

32
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,040
For that, she’s rather young.

33
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,400
Weird one, hot dog bun, loved one!

34
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,210
Maybe she’s his secret love-child?

35
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,710
For that, she’s rather old.

36
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,180
Child, mild, wild!

37
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,180
But I’m surprised.

38
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,150
I wasn’t expecting Pao’s daughter
to be this old already…

39
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,990
You probably don’t remember…

40
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,960
…but I met you once when
you were this little.

41
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,530
How do you know my father?

42
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,590
How?

43
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,400
Just an acquaintance.
It’s been 10 years already.

44
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,610
But your father sure was unlucky
to be in a traffic accident…

45
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,980
On the way to Jupiter, there was a sudden
spatial fluctuation in hyperspace…

46
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,010
Here you go.

47
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,090
Thank you.

48
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,920
Are you the “girlfriend?”

49
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,330
Are you the “secret love-child?”

50
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,230
Rejected!

51
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,110
Mr. Jet, why were you at the graveyard?

52
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,980
Nobody outside the family knows
he got into an accident…

53
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,050
“Seek the sacred beast from Anzan.”

54
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,020
“I am at the meeting place
of the four gods.”

55
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,060
This is?

56
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,300
Pao sent me this.

57
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
When?

58
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,730
Three days ago.

59
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,460
Right before the accident…

60
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,470
Please! Can you help me?!

61
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,740
I’m sure this is the whereabouts
of the sun stone!

62
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,480
Sun stone?

63
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,650
The direction, day, and time you arrived
was the best combination for Feng Shui!

64
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,140
Especially when you’re
searching for something!

65
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,050
I-It was?

66
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,290
It was!

67
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,560
Please, Mr. Jet!

68
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,560
Yes. About that, we will have it soon.

69
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,600
Yes, I understand.

70
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,190
How was the boss feeling?

71
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,670
Well…

72
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,000
There’s no way it could be good.

73
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,730
Of course not…

74
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,000
Let’s go!

75
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,810
<i>I didn’t have any particular favors</i>
<i>to repay to Pao or this girl…</i>

76
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,640
<i>…but I decided to help them for now.</i>

77
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,450
<i>There were too many things that made</i>
<i>me suspicious to leave it alone.</i>

78
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,010
<i>Why did Pao send me mail</i>
<i>right before his death?</i>

79
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,920
<i>What do those words mean?</i>

80
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,720
<i>Who were those guys that attacked us?</i>

81
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,990
<i>And there was something about</i>
<i>this girl named Meifa as well…</i>

82
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,080
This universe is made
of three different Chis.

83
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,920
One is the Chi of Heaven,
the energy that comes from the Sun.

84
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,760
One is the Chi of Earth, the energy
that comes from a planet’s surface.

85
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,960
And lastly Chi of Magnetism, the Chi
that organisms like ourselves produce.

86
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,990
Chi from organisms?

87
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,000
The human body always
produces a magnetic field.

88
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,600
That magnetic field and
the magnetic field of the Earth…

89
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,580
…react to one another
to create energy.

90
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,550
Universal Feng Shui is the
technology that reads the energies…

91
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,710
…of nature such as this to
use them in everyday life.

92
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,180
Ice cream.

93
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,790
Universal Feng Shui…

94
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,850
It’s not the same thing
as fortunetelling?

95
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,330
Other fortunetelling methods
only predict or prognosticate.

96
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,840
However, Universal Feng Shui has the
power to make the bad into the good.

97
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,780
For example, if you were a Feng Shui
master as powerful as my father…

98
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,270
What’s wrong?

99
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,680
I just realized that I never spent
time like this with my father…

100
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,380
Hey, now.

101
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,620
Let me point out that
I’m not that old.

102
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,120
If anything, I would be a boyfriend…

103
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,190
No, wait, that would be bad.

104
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,320
W-What am I saying?

105
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,890
At least I can be an
elder brother or something…

106
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,760
Ice cream…

107
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,860
Ice cream.

108
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,210
Let’s go, Mr. Jet!

109
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,290
I believe that “Anzan” refers to here.

110
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,810
The Mountain Hotel Building…

111
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,460
There!

112
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,760
Seiryu!
(Blue Dragon)

113
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,610
Byakko!
(White Tiger)

114
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,020
Genbu!
(Black Turtle)

115
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,490
Suzaku!
(Scarlet Phoenix)

116
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,250
Hey…

117
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,420
I know, the cross-zenith method!

118
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,030
The sun stone is here!

119
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,660
Are you sure?

120
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,550
There they are.
They’re right over there.

121
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,410
All right.

122
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,870
I finally found it…

123
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,840
This must be the sun stone.

124
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,350
This thing?

125
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,390
Mr. Jet?

126
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,260
Outta the way.

127
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,170
What are you doing?

128
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,170
One bottle of lao-chu.
I don’t need a glass.

129
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,710
Take that!

130
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,360
Hey, who are you guys?

131
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,630
Heh, you think we would
tell you that easily…

132
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,630
W-We’re from the Blue Snake…

133
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,400
So you are from a syndicate…

134
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,770
Why are you following us around?

135
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,950
I-I couldn’t tell you that
even if you killed me…

136
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,940
I-It was because we couldn’t get Pao…

137
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,050
So they told us to get
the recipient of his mail…

138
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,780
I-I’m telling the truth!

139
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,060
We’re on the low end so we
don’t know any more than that!

140
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,030
I’m sure.

141
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,010
Mr. Jet…

142
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,730
My father… is alive?

143
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,250
<i>Pao’s words showed where</i>
<i>this stone was.</i>

144
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,950
<i>Does that mean Pao is</i>
<i>still alive somewhere?</i>

145
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,750
<i>Did he want me to find this</i>
<i>stone and do something with it?</i>

146
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,560
<i>It feels like I created more</i>
<i>mysteries instead of solving them.</i>

147
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:56,330
<i>For now, I decided to check out</i>
<i>this stone, which was our only clue.</i>

148
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,140
So this is a piece of the moon from
that Gate accident 50 years ago…

149
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:10,240
We Feng Shui masters
call it the sun stone.

150
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,210
It’s absorbed the fluctuations
in time and space…

151
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,780
…and conceals a tremendous
amount of energy.

152
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,560
I can only think of it
as a plain old rock…

153
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,290
So, how much would it be if we sold it?

154
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,320
Hey, guys, if you’re gonna
smoke, go smoke outside.

155
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,530
What?

156
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,660
You always smoke in here, too!

157
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,040
I’m turning this into a
nonsmoking area starting today.

158
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,700
Hey, now, you’re kidding, right?

159
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,910
This ship is my ship, remember?

160
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,220
So, what are you gonna
do with this stone?

161
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,160
I… have no idea.

162
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,330
I don’t know what my
father is thinking…

163
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,970
Oh, hey, wait!

164
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,130
Ein! Wait!

165
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,810
The luo-pan…

166
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,940
What?

167
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,010
That can’t be…
I took the magnet off…

168
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,010
I see… I get it now…

169
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,720
So that’s it!

170
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,590
That’s it!!

171
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,740
If I remember correctly, my father
owned a sun stone as well.

172
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,070
I’m sure that the two
stones are resonating…

173
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,480
…to show me the
whereabouts of my father.

174
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,850
And that’s why Pao made you
look for this stone…

175
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,580
But…

176
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,050
I don’t know why my father
sent the mail to you, Mr. Jet…

177
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,220
…and not to me…

178
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,540
What do you think?

179
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,270
They make a good couple.

180
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,650
It’s a dangerous combination.

181
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,880
What is?

182
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,680
The more righteous a guy
was in his youth…

183
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,380
…the more likely he’s gonna fall
for a young girl later in life.

184
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,580
Is that so?

185
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,150
Really… Guys are so clueless.

186
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,090
My father…

187
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,730
…was one that believed in Universal
Feng Shui, but not other people…

188
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,900
So my mother left the house,
and took me along.

189
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,630
That was seven years ago…

190
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:56,210
I’m sure my father was able
to find our whereabouts easily.

191
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,840
But he never even tried
to look for us…

192
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,620
I’m sure there was a reason behind it.

193
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,780
Why was my father
targeted by those men?

194
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,760
Was it because he was
friends with bad people?

195
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,900
Please, tell me the truth!

196
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,230
Who my father really was…

197
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:23,240
Pao… was the consultant
for a syndicate.

198
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,780
That’s the truth.

199
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,710
Pao had leaked
information to me about…

200
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,220
…the syndicate, back
when I was a detective.

201
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,080
Pao already wanted out of
the syndicate back then.

202
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,610
However, it’s impossible
for someone who knows…

203
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,220
…important syndicate secrets
to ever leave the group.

204
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,900
I’m sure Pao was afraid that more bad
things would happen to his family.

205
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,840
Well, I’m sure you can confirm
it all when you see him.

206
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,250
Here!

207
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,290
Around here…

208
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,990
There isn’t anything here.

209
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,130
How about the radar?

210
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,170
No response.

211
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,110
That can’t be…
I’m sure this is the place…

212
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,070
Hmm? Wait…

213
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,440
Hold on…

214
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,280
Do we have guests?

215
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,840
They sure are persistent.

216
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,550
Spike, Faye, please take care of them!

217
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,990
Aren’t they your guests?

218
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,450
Help me out if you don’t
wanna die with this ship!

219
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,120
What rotten luck of the draw.

220
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,970
<i>Sometimes it’s good to act without</i>
<i>asking “What’s in it for me?”.</i>

221
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,700
We’re fairies who are going to
grant the princess’ wish.

222
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,760
<i>We are?</i>

223
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,480
Unmanned fighters?

224
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,510
So these would be the seven dwarves…

225
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Shit! They’re trying to scare us!

226
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,690
I got it!

227
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,380
<i>Spike! Come back here!</i>

228
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,580
What?!

229
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,380
<i>Apparently, if we apply lots</i>
<i>of energy to that stone…</i>

230
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,370
<i>…we can draw out all the</i>
<i>forces trapped inside it.</i>

231
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,180
And, what are we going to do?

232
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,920
This is an all-or-nothing plan, but…

233
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,860
I don’t care what it is, just hurry!

234
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,730
I put it in!

235
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,010
All right!

236
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,640
<i>Blast this rock with</i>
<i>your plasma cannon.</i>

237
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,120
What a great plan this is…

238
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,050
<i>Looks like you made it in time, Jet…</i>

239
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,250
Pao! You’re…

240
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,220
<i>Meifa… It’s been a while.</i>

241
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,760
Pao, you’re in unstable territory.
I can’t approach any closer than this.

242
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,260
<i>I know… There isn’t any,</i>
<i>oxygen left in here anyway,</i>

243
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,500
<i>I sent you that mail because I wanted</i>
<i>you to bring my daughter here…</i>

244
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:47,450
Then… you willed us to be here
like this using Feng Shui?!

245
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,180
<i>Yeah…</i>

246
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,860
That’s not true, Pao.

247
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,560
This wasn’t your doing.

248
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,260
Meifa is here now…

249
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,100
…because she wanted to come here.

250
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,480
<i>You might be right.</i>

251
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,570
<i>Perhaps I was being too hotheaded…</i>

252
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,480
<i>Meifa… it’s wonderful to</i>
<i>see you one last time…</i>

253
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,950
I hated you all this time…

254
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,360
I despised you all this time…

255
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,500
But…

256
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,940
Papa…

257
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,400
<i>Now, I don’t know if it was a good thing</i>
<i>or a bad thing that we took her along.</i>

258
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,600
<i>In any case, this was how</i>
<i>this strange case ended.</i>

259
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,940
<i>She went back to Mars.</i>

260
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,600
<i>And the smoking ban was lifted</i>
<i>from the living quarters.</i>

261
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,210
<i>Once again, unchanging daily life</i>
<i>has returned, just as it was before.</i>

262
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,120
<i>One thing that has changed, though…</i>

263
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,280
<i>I no longer read the</i>
<i>fortunetelling pages in magazines.</i>

264
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,770
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

265
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:58,110
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

266
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:03,810
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

267
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:10,550
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

268
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:19,800
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

269
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,810
The real folk blues.

270
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:33,220
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

271
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:40,850
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

272
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:45,350
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

273
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:54,270
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

274
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,130
He… came with a whistle.

275
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,170
COMING EPISODE
He… came with a whistle.

276
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,280
He… came with a whistle.

277
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,560
A man, Andy, made a sudden
appearance on horseback.

278
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,220
Who in the world is he?

279
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:31,460
Is he an ally or a foe?
Or is he a true cowboy?

280
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,130
The next episode is a shocking sci-fi
macaroni-western epic saga: “Cowboy Funk”.

281
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,200
COWBOY FUNK
Wait a minute, isn’t this
world view a bit different?
