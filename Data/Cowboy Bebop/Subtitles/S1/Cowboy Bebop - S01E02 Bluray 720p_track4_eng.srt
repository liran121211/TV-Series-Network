1
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,400
Come out!
You can’t run anymore!

2
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,340
We’ll shoot!

3
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,200
Give up already, Abdul Hakim!

4
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,680
So ya wanna fight, huh?

5
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,230
You’re such a…

6
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,520
STRAY DOG STRUT

7
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,760
<i>Amigo!</i>

8
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,270
<i>How’re all you 300,000 bounty hunters</i>
<i>in the solar system doing?</i>

9
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,000
<i>It’s time for BIG SHOT, the show that</i>
<i>brings you information about fugitives!</i>

10
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,680
<i>Well, well, first up for today,</i>
<i>is this guy: Abdul Hakim.</i>

11
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,980
<i>He’s known as a serial pet thief.</i>

12
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,880
<i>This time, he snagged</i>
<i>a test animal…</i>

13
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,020
<i>…from a research facility,</i>
<i>and is on the loose.</i>

14
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,690
<i>The good news is that he’s</i>
<i>worth a whopping 8 million!</i>

15
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,490
<i>The conditions are as always.</i>

16
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,090
<i>Bring him in alive to</i>
<i>collect your reward.</i>

17
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,160
<i>If you kill him,</i>
<i>kiss your reward good-bye.</i>

18
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,530
<i>He’s the biggest we’ve had in a while.</i>
<i>Do your best to get this guy</i>

19
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,730
How’s it look?

20
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,630
It’s done for.

21
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,470
Man, why does everything?

22
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,770
<i>Hey.</i>

23
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,840
Doctor? You got information?

24
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,140
<i>About Abdul Hakim.</i>

25
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,610
<i>—I’ll take it!</i>
—I’ll give a discount. 300.

26
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,550
I got his post-plastic surgery picture.

27
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,450
<i>Too much. 20 down.</i>

28
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,850
All right, 280.
On one condition.

29
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,320
What’s that?

30
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,220
<i>Sock him one.</i>

31
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,720
<i>He trampled over me.</i>
<i>If you want, punch him a dozen times.</i>

32
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,520
I’ve got the goods.

33
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,320
This one should be something big…

34
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,930
Yeah, see you in six hours.

35
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,570
<i>He had a very conspicuous suitcase.</i>

36
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,900
That info’s included
in the deal, right?

37
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,740
<i>Oh, all right.</i>

38
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,510
<i>It was something that could</i>
<i>carry a small woman inside.</i>

39
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,610
Treasure?

40
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,440
<i>Can’t really say,</i>

41
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,040
<i>The way he handled it</i>
<i>sure didn’t seem that way,</i>

42
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,460
Ni-lai-la!

43
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,130
If you feel lethargic,
have some ginseng hei-sui.

44
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,060
You’ll last a week with it!

45
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,900
If you’re tired,
have sugarcane hei-sui.

46
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,800
You ate too much?
Then have pineapple hei-sui.

47
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,340
Gimme some lao-chu.

48
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,700
Thank you.

49
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,190
Here you go.

50
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,110
Sorry. My apologies, bro.

51
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,480
Hey, I said I’m sorry!

52
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,070
What, can’t say anything?

53
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,050
Wh— What? Ya pickin’ a fight?

54
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,520
My treat.

55
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,830
Drink.

56
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,420
And now, the loot.

57
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,550
Even if I overhaul this whole craft,
I’ll have some change!

58
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,720
Guess I’ll go eat Peking Duck with it.

59
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,660
As they say, “Don’t count
chickens before they hatch.”

60
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,090
I got this one nailed shut!

61
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,830
<i>Well, give it what you got.</i>

62
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,840
So all three went down?

63
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
Seems that way.

64
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,740
And Hakim is around here?

65
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,280
Seems that way.

66
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,070
Dammit, he doesn’t even know how
much that thing is REALLY worth.

67
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,890
A pet shop?

68
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,790
A shady one at that.

69
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,560
Hey, bro, you can buy
anything here on Mars.

70
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,900
From guns to human lives.

71
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,400
If ya wanna know,
show me what ya got.

72
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,000
The chain on this one is long.
Must be the “Way of the Dragon” model.

73
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,470
Oh, you can tell?
That’s a rare one from the ’30s!

74
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,900
It sure is an antique.

75
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,820
Try the store called Animal
Treasure off of Caiphon Road.

76
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,940
I’m sure you’ll find something there.

77
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,020
Okay, I’ll look… but I’ll decide if I
want to buy it from you after I see it.

78
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,260
Oh, all right.

79
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,070
Run out of funds changing your
face around too much, Hakim?

80
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,780
W-Wait a sec…

81
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,250
Hey, don’t move.

82
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,090
You sure are restless, changing
your face around this much.

83
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:12,920
What the?

84
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,490
Hold it. I don’t want any
of this business here.

85
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,630
All of my babies are very sensitive!

86
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,430
You open it.

87
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,060
Why do I?!

88
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,530
There seems to be some
sort of misunderstanding…

89
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,900
Hurry it up!

90
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,900
Oh, fine.

91
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,890
A dog?

92
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,320
A Welsh Corgi.
It’s cute, but it’s everywhere.

93
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,660
Not a particularly rare species.

94
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,060
And how much is it worth?

95
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,570
With the suitcase, about this much.

96
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,530
200K?

97
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,727
No, no, 200, 200!

98
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:01,200
No way!

99
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,570
You don’t like it, you take care
of it yourself. Like eating it.

100
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,192
It is a puppy…

101
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,070
Sorry to bother you. Please continue.

102
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,350
I guess the Peking Duck
has been overcooked.

103
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,520
At least give me 300…

104
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,660
No can do.

105
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,520
280?

106
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,060
A no is a no.

107
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,960
250!

108
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,760
ZERO. I’ll take it back.

109
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,060
This again?
What is it this time?

110
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,978
Someone! Catch my babies! Hurry!

111
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,410
—There it is!
—All right!

112
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,450
Hakim?!
God dammit, what’s going on?!

113
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,100
—Gangway!
—What the hell?

114
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,760
WAIT, dammit!

115
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,660
Hey, what the hell do you want?!

116
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,720
Bounty hunter?

117
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,810
Animal rights syndicate?

118
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,720
Your story brings a tear to my eye.

119
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,550
Risking your life on a dog
that’s only worth 200 woolongs.

120
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,760
What?

121
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:10,390
What I want are the 8 million woolongs
hanging from your neck.

122
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,570
Not bad.

123
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,440
What?!

124
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,240
Dammit!

125
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,200
Shuddup!
I’m in a rotten mood right now!

126
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,380
There, there.
Here, lemme put on a collar.

127
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,090
A dog instead of a duck, huh?

128
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,190
Forget about that!
You know anything about it?

129
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,200
Yeah. This is a Welsh Corgi.
A total mongrel.

130
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Totally?

131
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,470
Totally. Completely worthless.

132
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,300
Shit, this gives me a headache.

133
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,630
And all this is
because of this mongrel…

134
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,480
The dog is worthless,
but the owner is worth something.

135
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Well, at least you should get
to know this critter well.

136
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,485
Man, I hate kids and critters!

137
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:38,654
They’re nothing but trouble!

138
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,320
I got something!

139
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,020
All right!

140
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,850
It’s big!

141
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,530
Here it comes!

142
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,390
Pull on the line!

143
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,490
What time is it now?

144
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,040
I-I-It’s 4 o’clock now.

145
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,340
Two hours…

146
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,680
Who was that with Hakim? His ally?

147
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,810
Seems that way.

148
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,050
We got no clues?
We have to do something.

149
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,820
If that falls into police hands,
we’re in deep shit.

150
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,220
Seems that way.

151
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,730
All our work will be worthless if our
experiments get revealed to the public.

152
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,860
Seems that way.

153
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,950
How much does he think we
put into that “data dog”?

154
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,900
Why don’t YOU do this?

155
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,700
Didn’t your grandma teach you
to finish what you start?

156
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,270
She was dead before I was born.

157
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,270
<i>Sorry to hear that.</i>
<i>Anyway, we have the joker in our hand.</i>

158
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,010
Just do what we planned.

159
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,580
Give me code name “snoop.”

160
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,180
Yeah. It’s me.
I had some trouble.

161
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,260
No big deal…

162
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,750
Hey, wait, Michael!

163
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,600
I want to postpone the meeting a bit.

164
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,800
As I said, it wasn’t that big a deal…

165
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,030
Impossible? Why? Hey, wait!

166
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,041
And this is our plan?

167
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,980
Hey, you!

168
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,460
You have something you
want to know, right?

169
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,890
Wait!

170
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,790
My little Peeko can
answer your questions!

171
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,260
You have something you
want to know, right?

172
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,930
See, little Peeko is telling me…

173
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,190
…that you’re looking
for someone or something.

174
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,660
Well, where there’s
this dog, there’s Hakim.

175
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,630
Seeing loud and clear.

176
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,100
We’re counting on you, pooch.

177
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,450
We must resort to the dog whistle.

178
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,720
But that’ll cause a big mess.

179
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,750
I don’t care.

180
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,060
We’ll draw attention to ourselves!

181
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,860
We have no choice!

182
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,850
Shall I?

183
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,890
Do it.

184
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,110
I can’t hear anything.

185
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,440
I said before that
humans can’t hear it.

186
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,650
Oh, that’s right.

187
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,150
This is so farfetched…

188
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,420
Will this really attract?

189
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,910
Oh, it’s moving.
Something is now on the move.

190
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,380
Wait! Babies, what’s
wrong with you guys?!

191
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,280
Hey, wait!

192
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,630
It got away, Jet!

193
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,500
Huh? Hakim?

194
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,351
<i>No, the dog!</i>

195
00:15:56,351 --> 00:16:01,040
It’s close, it’s close!
What you are looking for is nearby.

196
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,120
In fact, right in
front of your eyes…

197
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,130
Hey, wait, you need to pay!

198
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,200
I’ll pay when I am rich!

199
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,160
You can’t be serious…

200
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,740
Goddammit, what the hell is going on?!

201
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,180
Happy?

202
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,980
Yes, very.

203
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,480
—Excuse me…
—Outta my way!

204
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,120
You, what are you doing?

205
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,890
Hakim!

206
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,720
Dammit!

207
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,730
It’s just a dog, after all.

208
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,410
Hakim!

209
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,980
<i>Spike, he’s headed for Interstate 6.</i>

210
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,260
<i>Great!</i>

211
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,290
<i>If he thinks he can outrun me,</i>
<i>he’s welcome to try.</i>

212
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,260
Don’t get too hotheaded!

213
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,160
What part of me is hotheaded?!

214
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,460
There he is!

215
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,730
This is payback from earlier!

216
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,470
…the hell are you doin’?!
This guy is mine!

217
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,810
What the?

218
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:03,670
Now!

219
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,200
Stop that!

220
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,340
Shit!

221
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,840
Shit!

222
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,000
This is why I hate critters!

223
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,280
<i>Amigo!</i>

224
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,650
<i>How’re all you 300,000 bounty hunters</i>
<i>in the solar system doing?</i>

225
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,550
<i>It’s time for Big Shot, the show that</i>
<i>brings you information about fugitives!</i>

226
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,250
<i>So, you remember Abdul Hakim</i>
<i>who chose a rather…</i>

227
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,160
<i>…flashy way of turning</i>
<i>himself in last week?</i>

228
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,890
<i>Yeah! Of course!</i>

229
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,260
<i>Apparently, he stole what’s</i>
<i>called a “data dog”…</i>

230
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,140
<i>…created in an illegal</i>
<i>experiment of some research firm.</i>

231
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,900
<i>Wow! What’s that?</i>

232
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,980
<i>I’m not sure myself, but apparently,</i>
<i>it’s a very intelligent pooch.</i>

233
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,850
<i>I hear that it’s</i>
<i>priceless among collectors.</i>

234
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,520
<i>That’s a surprise!</i>
<i>I wanna have a dog like that!</i>

235
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,190
<i>But they say it’s still missing.</i>

236
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,290
<i>I wonder where it went?</i>

237
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,020
<i>Really</i>
<i>But now, a commercial!</i>

238
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,020
Can’t be…

239
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,470
Hey there! When you’re done cleaning,
feed the komodo dragons!

240
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,170
I want you to work your ass off!

241
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah…

242
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,810
Hey, hey!

243
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,340
Hey, don’t jump on there!

244
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,080
That’s cold!

245
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,990
That’s why I said we should
throw out mongrels like this one!

246
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,750
But you’re the one
that brought it here!

247
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,780
In any case, we have to do
something about the ticks.

248
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,429
Shit…

249
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:02,370
I’m gonna salt you
and eat you, dammit!

250
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,570
<i>Well, it’s time for us to go.</i>
<i>See you next time!</i>

251
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,500
<i>Good luck!!</i>

252
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,370
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

253
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:34,710
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

254
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,410
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

255
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:47,150
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

256
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:56,400
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

257
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,410
The real folk blues.

258
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:09,820
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

259
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:17,450
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

260
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,950
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

261
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:30,870
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

262
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,530
COMING EPISODE

263
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,580
“Nothing is permanent.”
It’s a fact of life.

264
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,410
The bell tolls for the great
ones who will someday fall.

265
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,310
Money makes the world go round…

266
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,680
…but debt piles up
before you know it.

267
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,120
I wandered through
all the reaches of space…

268
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,920
…and there I met a cowboy.

269
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,220
A session to the tune
of an off-key melody:

270
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:12,930
HONKY TONK WOMEN

271
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,560
Honky Tonk Women.
HONKY TONK WOMEN

272
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:15,660
Honky Tonk Women.
