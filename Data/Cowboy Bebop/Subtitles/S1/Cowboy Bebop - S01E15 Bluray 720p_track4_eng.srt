1
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,190
Frozen, frozen, hard.

2
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,100
No good after all…

3
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,090
It’s full of dioxins.

4
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,540
I had saved this as
evidence a while back…

5
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,280
Don’t eat it,
you malnutritioned kid!!

6
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,350
Then you want to catch a fraud?
A matrimonial fraud?

7
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,880
Guess I have no choice.

8
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,980
What kinda fraud? Is it big?

9
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,650
Smallest of the small fry.

10
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,630
I don’t think Spike
will be up for this…

11
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,820
Ed wants chicken kabobs!

12
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,790
Guess I’ll do it alone.

13
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,800
You have got to be kidding!

14
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,010
Give me a break…

15
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,920
This stinks!

16
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,520
Really…

17
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,790
Weren’t you taught that you
should wipe your own butt?

18
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,200
I’ve been thinking of who
you remind me of…

19
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,670
I know now.
That guy with the thin eyebrows…

20
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,370
Whitney Hagas Matsumoto.

21
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,480
I wonder why I suddenly
was reminded of him…

22
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,150
Do you want to know something about
my past that nobody else knows?

23
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,610
MY FUNNY VALENTINE

24
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,580
Miss Manley, does she look
resuscitated to you?

25
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,770
Yes, she does, Doctor.

26
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,280
Miss Manley, does she look
like an old woman to you?

27
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,050
No, she doesn’t, Doctor.

28
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,060
Do you think she has been
successfully defrosted?

29
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,890
I believe so, Doctor.

30
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,320
Can you hear me?

31
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,090
I am Doctor Baccus.

32
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,660
Baccus, as in the Baccus that
drowned more humans than Neptune.

33
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,900
Do you know about him?

34
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,840
But I used to be an alcoholic.
Baccus was drowning thanks to Baccus.

35
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,110
Hey, that was great!

36
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,610
All right, open wide…

37
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,020
No problems. You have no wounds left,
and the cells are dividing nicely.

38
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,260
Now… you only have
one problem to solve.

39
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,990
Oh, it’s just a simple process.

40
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,900
The 30 million for the basic operation,
and 54 years’ worth of interest.

41
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,490
Hey, how much is that?

42
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:03,470
273 million… add to that the hospital
fees for a total of 300,028,000 woolongs.

43
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,470
Yes, if you pay up that much,
you will be free. Do you understand?

44
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,500
I don’t understand…

45
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,180
Yes, that’s it…

46
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,340
What?!

47
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,680
Where is this?

48
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,660
Who am I?

49
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,660
Miss Manley?

50
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,890
She is not acting, Doctor.

51
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,300
I am Whitney Hagas Matsumoto,
your lawyer.

52
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,370
Lawyer?

53
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:41,250
At the request of the Totus Insurance
Company, I did some research on your past.

54
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,220
Miss Faye Valentine.

55
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,620
Is that really my name?

56
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,020
It’s a lovely name.

57
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,290
It suits you very well.

58
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,220
…and?

59
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,460
How much of your memory
do you still have?

60
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,750
This is a TV…

61
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,960
…this is a hot water pot…

62
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,000
…and this is a cellular phone.

63
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,490
I know everything…

64
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,260
…except about myself.

65
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,290
I see.

66
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,360
And?

67
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,700
According to the materials that
remain, when you were 20…

68
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,730
…well, you are still 20…

69
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,210
…you seem to have been
involved in a serious accident.

70
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,180
Accident?

71
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,650
Such that medical technology back
then could not completely cure you…

72
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,910
I’m totally fine, as you can see…

73
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,780
Not a scratch on my body…

74
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,150
Wait, what do you mean,
“back then”?

75
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,850
That was 54 years ago.

76
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,830
You have been in cold-sleep, or rather
cryogenically preserved, to this day.

77
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:39,070
And you were able to reawaken now that
you could get the treatment you needed.

78
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,830
Just like Sleeping Beauty.

79
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,330
You’re kidding, right?

80
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,610
I am being serious.

81
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,780
Then this is a dream…

82
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,810
No, it is definitely 2068 now.

83
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,720
And this isn’t a TV…

84
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,660
…but a washing machine.

85
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,180
And this isn’t a hot water pot…

86
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,090
…but an automatic
face-washing machine.

87
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,260
And this is not a telephone,
but a thermometer.

88
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,760
You put this round segment
in your mouth…

89
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,860
Don’t mock me!

90
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,800
You just start saying stuff like that,
and you expect me to believe…

91
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,970
<i>Body temperature: 34.5 degrees Celsius.</i>
<i>Pulse: 54. Blood pressure: 40/75.</i>

92
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,670
—Still low.
—Wait a minute!

93
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,080
Your memories end back when cellular
telephones still looked like this.

94
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,340
Then tell me!

95
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,540
What kind of accident?!
What was I like before then?!

96
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,020
Who am I?!

97
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,320
Calm down.
If you get excited, you…

98
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,150
What?! What is going to happen…

99
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,890
You’ll get sleepy.

100
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,500
<i>Would you like one?</i>

101
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,650
Hey!

102
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,850
Hey!!

103
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,120
Hey!!

104
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,860
W-Wait!

105
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,150
Miss Valentine!

106
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,530
Wait!

107
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,000
Don’t get near me!

108
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,560
What can you do by running away?!

109
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,040
Miss Valentine…

110
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,010
I can’t pay 300 million…

111
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,510
It’s unreasonable for them to
choose to resuscitate me…

112
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,490
…and then expect me
to pay the debt.

113
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,720
I don’t even know
anything about myself…

114
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,820
What should I do?

115
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,300
We can take it slow about the debt.

116
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,900
I will help you.

117
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,740
Your memory might come
back to you someday.

118
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,580
If you keep living,
you might meet someone wonderful.

119
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,420
What… is this?

120
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,260
An ID.

121
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,930
This way, if you die,
or if you forget yourself…

122
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,060
…they will know who you
are and where you’re from.

123
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,270
And I don’t have that…

124
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,700
What?!

125
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,800
The collection agency!

126
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,610
The insurance company got impatient!

127
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,800
What are we going to do?!

128
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,120
At this rate, we’re both doomed.

129
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,220
You should get out of the car and run.

130
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,450
What about you?

131
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,320
We’ll meet up at the
Doctor’s place. All right?

132
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,160
Why are you helping me?

133
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,660
The prince must protect
his sleeping beauty.

134
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,380
We just went through the paperwork.

135
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,480
He told us to hand you all of his
assets if something happened to him…

136
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,890
If you give us a thumbprint here,
everything he owns will be yours.

137
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,690
Whitney…

138
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,460
You really cared for me…

139
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,790
Now, put your thumb here.

140
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,170
Why are the numbers all red?

141
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,080
Well, they say that debt is an asset…

142
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,450
Debt…

143
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,290
You have got to be kidding!

144
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,580
I was stupid back then,
now that I think about it.

145
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,960
I mean, he risked
his life to save me…

146
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,900
His debt was nothing compared to mine.

147
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,740
It really wasn’t that much…

148
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,640
You were there the whole time?

149
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,180
Your story was way too long.

150
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,690
You are a horrible woman.

151
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,090
I’m sure that guy is
weeping in the afterlife…

152
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,070
…now that you ran away
without paying the debt.

153
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,070
I can’t help it.
It’s not a sum that I can pay off.

154
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,000
Now you’re being defiant about it.

155
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,630
I’ve got some nerve, alright…
I’m much older than you are.

156
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,550
Your past is all lies.
What was that about Romani?

157
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,640
Did you make this story up, too?

158
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,250
It’s neither a lie, nor a fake.

159
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,020
I just don’t know the truth.

160
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,580
Like I can help it.

161
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,490
Welcome back!

162
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,390
This guy is known as
the “Madam Killer.”

163
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,700
Well, he’s just a cheap
matrimonial fraud…

164
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,930
Sure doesn’t look like one.

165
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,630
Well, I can do a good job
even by myself.

166
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,800
Got that?

167
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,540
Whitney Hagas Matsumoto…

168
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,020
H-Hey… long time no see…

169
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,960
What kinda relationship do they have
that she wants to talk to him alone?

170
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,050
Apparently it’s a pretty
deep relationship.

171
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,860
An old guy of hers?

172
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,700
They were made for each other.

173
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,560
You seem very, very well,
Mister Lawyer.

174
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,240
Is it because I’m fat?
Isn’t that a biased opinion?

175
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,040
I demand an explanation.

176
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,380
I got a fat implant
after that accident.

177
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,440
Got a little incision around
the armpit, and had it squeezed in…

178
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,920
Not that!

179
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,140
It’s been three years?

180
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,810
You look healthy, I’m glad.

181
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,120
Yea, I’m sure you are.

182
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,280
Did you think that you completely
reinvented yourself by doing that?

183
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,420
I wanted to start over…

184
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,520
…start everything over…

185
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,620
And so you went with matrimonial fraud.

186
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,570
To think you’re a bounty hunter…
This must have been destined.

187
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,730
So everyone was in on it?

188
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,740
Back then, I couldn’t do anything else.
Because he sheltered me, the doctor…

189
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,300
Maybe it was better
to have been caught.

190
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,440
I couldn’t wish for anything more than
having you hand me over to the police.

191
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,450
You think it’s all right
to leave them alone?

192
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,980
You worried about her?

193
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,580
I just thought that she
might let him go.

194
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,620
Does she have that much
sympathy in her heart?

195
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,250
Women as insistent as her
tend to be the ones…

196
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,490
…who get emotionally
swayed by their exes.

197
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,970
Is that so?

198
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,330
Women don’t work on reason.

199
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,830
Welcome, visitors!

200
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,640
<i>So are you the ones</i>
<i>that reported to us?</i>

201
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,270
<i>Yeah, I want to claim a bounty,</i>

202
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,300
<i>I see.</i>

203
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,280
Miss Manley, prepare to rendezvous.

204
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,310
Yes, Inspector.

205
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,790
I’m glad I was able to
meet you one last time.

206
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,220
Take care…

207
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,600
I won’t hand you over to them!

208
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,290
It’s all right.

209
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,600
You really don’t have to mind me!

210
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,770
Are they ready to depart already?

211
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,040
Is she gonna let him go?

212
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,200
She might be letting him go.

213
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,410
—You wanna bet?
—We’re splitting it 60–40.

214
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,880
Dammit, hurry up, Spike!

215
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,910
I’m trying!

216
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,280
I-It’s impossible…

217
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,810
…to get both of us in this!

218
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,720
I don’t care.

219
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,420
Breathe out some more! Exhale!

220
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,920
Hey, wait!

221
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,690
I’m not letting you have him!

222
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,420
She took the guy and not the money!

223
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,200
Jet captured him!

224
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,770
I have to repay my debt to him.

225
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,830
So I have the right to do what I want
with him, and the bounty on him!

226
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,410
Amazing. She clearly
states a pointless argument…

227
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,940
That’s what I told you.
Women don’t work on reason.

228
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,700
Get me off of this thing!

229
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,980
Are you gonna let him go?

230
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,710
We’ll see!

231
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,630
Visitor, thanks for coming!

232
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,090
Where are you going?

233
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,270
What are you going to do with me?

234
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,640
I want you to tell me the truth.

235
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,540
Why was I there?

236
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,740
Where does the truth end,
and where do the lies start?

237
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,620
What are you doing?!

238
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,090
If you’re not careful,
I’ll hit the pod.

239
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,960
I’m not going to be easy on you!

240
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,000
That’s my line!

241
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,840
You’re causing me a lot of trouble…

242
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,810
Who am I?

243
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,320
Do you really want to
know your own past?

244
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,490
Are you prepared for the consequences?

245
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,260
I am!

246
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,820
I see…

247
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,330
Wait a minute.

248
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,030
Well, I don’t really know myself.

249
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,300
You’re so…

250
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,640
<i>Who you really are, where you are</i>
<i>from, and where you will go.</i>

251
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,110
<i>That is a question that every human</i>
<i>asks himself at least once in his life.</i>

252
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,980
And who are you?

253
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,310
<i>However, puberty is the only time you</i>
<i>need to worry about things like that.</i>

254
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,510
<i>Only bored individuals think such</i>
<i>thoughts after a certain age.</i>

255
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,350
I’ve heard that voice before…

256
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,480
<i>Can you see me?</i>

257
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,690
Is that… the doctor and the nurse?

258
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,130
Seems… that way.

259
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,290
Didn’t you say something like
that doctor passed away?

260
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,130
No, no… I didn’t mean it that way…

261
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,040
You! How many lies do you have
to tell before you’re satisfied?!

262
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,700
Um… Er…

263
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,710
<i>You were cryogenically,</i>
<i>preserved there.</i>

264
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,510
<i>That we are certain of.</i>
<i>I guarantee it.</i>

265
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,580
What about my past?

266
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,080
Who in the world am I?

267
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,450
<i>I gave you the name Valentine.</i>

268
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,010
I named you after my favorite song.

269
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,360
As for everything else, all data was
lost back in that Gate accident.

270
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:24,760
<i>So I don’t know who you are, or</i>
<i>why you were put in cold-sleep…</i>

271
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,630
He wasn’t a cop?

272
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,860
<i>The patrol ship over there.</i>
<i>State your department.</i>

273
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,460
<i>I repeat. The patrol ship over there.</i>

274
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,300
<i>State your department</i>
<i>and registration number.</i>

275
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,440
Doctor… at this rate,
we will be apprehended.

276
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,750
It’s truly unfortunate, but it’s best
that we not meddle in this any longer.

277
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,720
Let’s give up.

278
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,650
<i>So, farewell, Whitney,</i>
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

279
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,620
<i>We’re sorry.</i>

280
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,790
H-Hey, wait! Uncle! Uncle!

281
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,290
Uncle?

282
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,330
I’ll take my bounty here and now!

283
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,810
There ya go!

284
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,370
Good riddance.

285
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,110
I guess you’re getting paid back
for all the lies that you told.

286
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,580
There is one truth that I have spoken.

287
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,300
That I fell in love with
you while you were asleep…

288
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,320
…in love with a sleeping beauty.

289
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,670
No, just kidding!

290
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,260
I’m lying! It’s a lie!

291
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,470
Did you want me to
come back that badly?

292
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,950
You sure got a big mouth.

293
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,640
You were jealous.

294
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,380
You really are a heartless woman.

295
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,650
I guess I don’t know anything
about my past anymore…

296
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,660
Isn’t that something that
really doesn’t matter?

297
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,160
You think that way
because you have a past.

298
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,820
No matter the past,
you still have a future.

299
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,030
What’s this?

300
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:12,130
Your share… of the 19,800 on his head.

301
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,370
19,800?

302
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,380
The smallest of the small fry.

303
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,670
It wasn’t 198,000?

304
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,510
I put an extra digit in there…

305
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:52,730
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

306
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:59,070
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

307
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:04,770
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

308
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:11,510
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

309
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:20,760
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

310
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,770
The real folk blues.

311
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:34,180
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

312
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:41,810
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

313
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:46,310
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

314
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:55,230
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

315
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,180
COMING EPISODE

316
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,420
So, the next episode
of Cowboy Bebop…

317
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,790
…I admit, is really
heavy and depressing.

318
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,130
The only people that show up
are well-aged, musty men.

319
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,160
I hate to say this,
but it is rather lackluster.

320
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,900
Children shouldn’t watch it.

321
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,670
Ladies should avoid it, too.

322
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,640
And to top it off, it’s better
for young guys to not watch either.

323
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,440
Next episode: “Black Dog Serenade”.

324
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,200
Just to all the old guys…
make sure you watch it.

325
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,160
BLACK DOG SERENADE
Just to all the old guys…
make sure you watch it.
