1
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,480
<i>The elders are going to be on the move.</i>

2
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,180
<i>It is dangerous over there as well.</i>

3
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,690
<i>Please hurry.</i>

4
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,400
THE REAL FOLK BLUES
(Part I)

5
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,240
What a foolish act you have done.

6
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,150
The fortuneteller told us thus.

7
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,190
“The night of the red moon,
the snake will slither…”

8
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,490
“…horribly quickly to make
use of its venomous fangs.”

9
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,260
You look so pitiful, Vicious.

10
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,200
We have informed you of our decision
that you cannot be our successor.

11
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,430
The syndicate does not need
corpses who cannot even fight.

12
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,940
That arrogance of yours will
ruin everything in the end.

13
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,050
Take him to the punishment chamber.

14
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,480
Kill me.

15
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,750
Right now.

16
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,650
You cannot choose how you will die.

17
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,630
After we let you have a good
taste of humiliation…

18
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,670
…we will send you
into the underworld.

19
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,900
Don’t forget…

20
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,080
…a snake’s venom poisons
slowly after the bite.

21
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,590
Sheesh, that was the first
time we screwed up so badly.

22
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,900
We never had anything
like that before…

23
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,330
…when we were all alone.

24
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,570
All told, they screwed up
our plans right to the end.

25
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,610
They really were like
troublesome babies.

26
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,080
I completely understand why
you hate women and kids now.

27
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,670
Too much vermouth.

28
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,240
Who are they?

29
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,420
Lin?!

30
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,160
I’m Shin, his younger brother.

31
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,860
Shin…

32
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,130
That’s right, you two were…

33
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,400
If you change sides, you won’t be
able to return to the syndicate.

34
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,910
What happened?

35
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,840
Vicious is to be executed.

36
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,510
He failed to pull off the coup, and has
been put under restraints by the elders.

37
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,180
You are in danger as well.

38
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,090
And Miss Julia…

39
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,580
Julia is?

40
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,930
They’re in the city of Tharsis.

41
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,460
I’ll hold them off here.

42
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,260
Please go!

43
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,860
I’ll owe you one, Shin!

44
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,320
I don’t know what
happened to Red Dragon…

45
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,190
…but it’s not really
your problem now, right?

46
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,490
Vicious, Julia…

47
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,860
To me, both those names
sound nothing but ominous.

48
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,170
Just like a magic spell that opens
a door that shouldn’t be opened.

49
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,610
You’re…

50
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,350
Hold still.

51
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,550
You are no longer a member
of the syndicate…

52
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,850
I know.

53
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,520
You, too…

54
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,090
Forget everything, including
the fact that we came here.

55
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,690
What are you talking about?

56
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,570
I’m just treating stray cats
that wandered into the office.

57
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,870
Stray cats that I can’t
ever get rid of…

58
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,800
When this is over,
I’m leaving the syndicate.

59
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,260
You’ll be killed.

60
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,100
I’ll let them say I’m dead.

61
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,510
I’ll be waiting at the graveyard.
Of course, I will be alive.

62
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,350
I… can’t come with you.

63
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,820
Come with me.

64
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,260
We’ll leave here…
We’ll escape from this world.

65
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,460
And then what are we going to do?

66
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,490
We’ll just live a life
of freedom somewhere.

67
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,160
Just like watching a dream…

68
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,610
<i>Are you going to betray me?</i>

69
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,950
Are you going to leave this world?

70
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,820
Vicious.

71
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,590
Even if it’s a dream,
that’s an impossibility.

72
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,860
Are you going to kill him?

73
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,830
Yeah…

74
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,160
…with your hands.

75
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,440
You stay alive…

76
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,740
…or you both die.

77
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,940
You can choose.

78
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,680
So there is no place for me after all.

79
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,880
I won’t go no matter who
comes to pick me up. Never.

80
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,550
I don’t want to live a life
where I’m always in someone’s way.

81
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,360
Mom! I’ve been looking for you!

82
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,870
A-Alfred…

83
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,300
I told you to wait in front
of the curry restaurant!

84
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,700
Sorry.

85
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,210
It’s all right. I’m glad you came.

86
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,410
It sounds too good to be true that
you can take care of me now.

87
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,880
Mom, I want to live with you.

88
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,350
You found a job?

89
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,720
Don’t worry about that.

90
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,550
What about your female co-host?

91
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,060
I heard she’s getting married.

92
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,530
Something about this…

93
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,520
<i>Where are you now?</i>

94
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,090
What is it?

95
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,520
<i>I’m heading out to the city of Tharsis.</i>

96
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,890
<i>You should head that way, too.</i>

97
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,260
Why?

98
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,690
<i>It’s hard for Jet to</i>
<i>get around on his own.</i>

99
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,250
<i>Especially after getting</i>
<i>shot in the leg.</i>

100
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,460
<i>I’m telling ya to stop wandering</i>
<i>around so much, and just come back.</i>

101
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,670
Don’t just assume that I’m coming back!

102
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,230
You’ve got to be kidding!

103
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,200
I have a place to go back to!

104
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,910
What’s with that attitude?
Like he’s all high-and-mighty.

105
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,470
What does he mean, Jet’s by himself?
He’s there… Ed and Ein, too…

106
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,380
You saved me.

107
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,710
Same here.

108
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,580
You’re a good shot.

109
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,550
I was getting bounties with it.

110
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,050
A bounty hunter?

111
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,720
Although now…

112
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,560
…I’m kind of on a break ’cause
there’s something going on.

113
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,530
You look like you have
something going on, too.

114
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,560
It might be good to pair up
with another woman.

115
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,000
How about it?
Wanna be my partner?

116
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,010
I have… something to do.

117
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,200
Oh.

118
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,680
Too bad.

119
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,640
Do you know any bounty hunter hangouts?

120
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,880
I can help if you want
to put a bounty on someone.

121
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,680
I’m looking for a bounty hunter.

122
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,290
I’ll drive you back.

123
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,400
What’s your name?

124
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,770
Faye…

125
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,670
Faye?!

126
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,470
Faye Valentine.

127
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,600
A common name.

128
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,940
What’s yours?

129
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,400
Julia.

130
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,670
Julia?!

131
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,380
It’s a common name.

132
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,860
I’m glad I met you.

133
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,190
Me, too.

134
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,790
Um, have I seen you somewhere?

135
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,570
If… you see Spike again…

136
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,140
Tell him that I will be waiting there.

137
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,400
He’ll know what I mean.

138
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,480
Tell him that I’ll keep waiting…

139
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,280
Why?

140
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,180
Good-bye, Faye Valentine.

141
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,790
Why?

142
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,390
Why do you know?!

143
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,920
Does it still hurt?

144
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,390
Do you know a story
that goes like this?

145
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,800
A man injured his leg during a hunt.

146
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,930
In the middle of the savanna…

147
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,840
…with no means to treat the wound,
the leg rots, and death approaches.

148
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,370
The man got onto the airplane
that finally arrived…

149
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,810
…and there he sees a land
of pure white below him.

150
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,720
The place glistening in the light was
the summit of a snow-covered mountain.

151
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,850
The name of the mountain
was Kilimanjaro.

152
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,550
The man thinks…

153
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,820
…that was where he was headed…

154
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,230
…and?

155
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,270
I hate this story.

156
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,000
Men only think about the past…

157
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,910
…right before their death,
as if they were…

158
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,840
…searching frantically for
proof that they were alive.

159
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,470
Turn back.

160
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,650
You told me when we first met…

161
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,490
…that you were a man who
had already died once.

162
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,460
Just forget the past, okay?

163
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,660
There was a woman.

164
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,260
For the first time in my life…

165
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,670
…I saw a woman that was truly alive.

166
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,930
That’s what I believed.

167
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,410
She was a piece of me I had lost.

168
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,740
She is my other half
that I had longed for.

169
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,280
—She’s back.
—Hm? Who?

170
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,290
Oh, man…

171
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,190
We’re not a repair shop.

172
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,130
Don’t come back just when
you broke something…

173
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,670
Where is he?

174
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,870
He?

175
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,960
The one with the fluffy hair.

176
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,070
What, can’t you just say
you’re looking for Spike?

177
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,240
Where is he?

178
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,140
He’s in the workshop.

179
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,050
What are you trying to hide?

180
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,110
You came back here just to see Spike?

181
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,180
I was asked to relay a message…

182
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,980
…from Julia.

183
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,220
Hey, wait!!

184
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,160
<i>Jet, it’s me.</i>

185
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,330
What, I don’t have any information now.
We’re not really able to…

186
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,960
<i>I’m glad you’re all right.</i>

187
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,170
<i>I was worried. It’s getting</i>
<i>to be pretty bad, you know…</i>

188
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,540
About Red Dragon?

189
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,630
<i>Yeah…</i>

190
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,010
<i>There was apparently,</i>
<i>a coup two days ago…</i>

191
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,440
<i>…concerning who was going to be</i>
<i>the syndicate’s successor.</i>

192
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,380
<i>In the end the elders won,</i>
<i>and they’re now out…</i>

193
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,850
<i>…to annihilate anyone who</i>
<i>was involved in the coup.</i>

194
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,720
<i>Your partner will also…</i>

195
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,520
Been there.

196
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,250
But why are they trying to get rid of
those that already left the syndicate?

197
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,120
<i>Anything against them will be</i>
<i>annihilated, down to the very last seed.</i>

198
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,460
<i>That’s how they do it.</i>

199
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,560
That’s the worst logic I’ve ever heard.

200
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,500
<i>Just run.</i>

201
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,330
<i>The police can’t handle all of it.</i>

202
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,740
<i>Leave Mars.</i>

203
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,640
Too late for that.

204
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,690
You have something?

205
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,660
You look like you
have some information.

206
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,000
How much will you pay for it?

207
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,340
I don’t have any money.

208
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,350
You sure came back at the worst time…

209
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,320
Weren’t you the one who called me here?

210
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,860
Or… maybe they followed you here?

211
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,430
Oh, well. It was gonna
happen sooner or later.

212
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,360
Wait!

213
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,830
Wait a minute!

214
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,470
I don’t have any money.

215
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,070
She said she’ll be waiting there.

216
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,440
She said you’d understand.

217
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,970
I don’t get it.

218
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,250
It was from a woman named Julia.

219
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,160
Someone was after her…

220
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,920
They were chasing her…

221
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,900
Jet, I can go at any time.

222
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,700
You who caused a disturbance
in our clan’s affairs.

223
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,940
By the will of the clan,
you shall be executed.

224
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,020
Let me out, too!

225
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,320
Wait!

226
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,150
Your right thruster isn’t working yet!

227
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,830
The end is the same if
we go down ship and all!

228
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,830
Will you leave words?

229
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,320
Or leave something material?

230
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,830
Nothing.

231
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,890
You shall shed red tears.

232
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,310
<i>Spike, can you still fly?</i>

233
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,820
Don’t worry about us. Just go!

234
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,380
Go grasp that thing you had lost.

235
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,850
<i>Go!</i>

236
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,730
As of now, the leadership
has changed hands.

237
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,940
From now on, I will dictate all authority
and symbolism of this syndicate.

238
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,310
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

239
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:58,650
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

240
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:04,350
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

241
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:11,090
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

242
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:20,340
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

243
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,350
The real folk blues.

244
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:33,760
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

245
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:41,390
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

246
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,890
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

247
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:54,810
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

248
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,920
A lot of things have happened,
but the next episode is the last.

249
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,930
COMING EPISODE
A lot of things have happened,
but the next episode is the last.

250
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,650
A lot of things have happened,
but the next episode is the last.

251
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,870
It sure was long…

252
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,880
—The past is the past…
—No use doing this…

253
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,380
—…and the future is the future.
—So how was it, Jet?

254
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,290
—A man is a man, and a woman is a woman.
—Because of you, I ended up raising Ein.

255
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,760
—I am who I am, and you are who you are.
—Dogs are really cute after all…

256
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,960
—Like it really matters any…
—Hey, Jet. Come on, you aren’t…

257
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,950
—I wonder why we gave him away…
—…listening to what I’m saying at all!

258
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,230
—Oh… What was it?
—Never mind.

259
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,240
Anyway… Next episode:
“The Real Folk Blues Part 2”.

260
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:36,950
We’ll see you again, somewhere.

261
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,500
THE REAL FOLK BLUES (Part II)
We’ll see you again, somewhere.

262
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,950
THE REAL FOLK BLUES (Part II)
What? This is the end?
