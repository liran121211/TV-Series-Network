1
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,500
This was the most
special of the special.

2
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,570
It was an emergency ration
for true emergencies…

3
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,200
…that was saved for the
last of the last resorts.

4
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,160
All I’m asking is who ate this.

5
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,270
Grudges over food sure are scary.

6
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:07,080
Spike, by perchance, was it you?

7
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,710
If I was the culprit, I wouldn’t leave
the empty box lying around like that.

8
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,650
Ed is hungry.

9
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,750
Maybe you ate it yourself,
but are pretending…

10
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,950
…to be upset because
we found the empty box?

11
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,360
What?!

12
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,330
We haven’t had anything to
eat for two whole days!!

13
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,530
Don’t you call a situation
like this an emergency?!

14
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,700
I wanna eat stuff like
fried beefun noodles…

15
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,870
We’re outta gas!
We can’t do anything about it!

16
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,770
If you could hold out
like this a bit longer…

17
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,210
…we’ll reach Europa soon
thanks to inertia.

18
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,940
Tummy’s caving in!

19
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,940
If only we could use that
energy to propel ourselves…

20
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,750
You keep mouthing off like that and
I’ll toss you out into absolute zero.

21
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,720
And a stir-fry of liver and
chives would be good, too…

22
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,090
Sounds good.

23
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,580
At least it’s better than aimlessly
floating around this place.

24
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,220
That was some collision…

25
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,450
Hey! Can you hear me? Answer me! Hey!!

26
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,490
Isn’t this…

27
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,930
…a hit-and-run?!

28
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,170
This is bad! The shock from that
collision changed our trajectory!

29
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,440
What did what to who?

30
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,710
What’s going on?!

31
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,100
MUSHROOM SAMBA

32
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,010
Huh?

33
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,390
Wow… Where is this place?

34
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,790
This is so uncivilized!

35
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,980
I don’t think that’s our problem…

36
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,460
We have to start by checking the ship.

37
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,330
Can you go get some food?

38
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,960
What?

39
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,930
I suddenly feel… a stabbing pain…

40
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,660
What are you trying to pull?

41
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,840
This expired a year ago…

42
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,080
I’m glad I didn’t eat it.

43
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,680
Serves you right.
This is divine retribution!

44
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,790
Let’s get to it…

45
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,330
Whatcha gonna do?

46
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,240
Ed will help, too!

47
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,240
We’re fine here, so go outside
and find us some food.

48
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,040
Okay!

49
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,080
Gotta wear my socks…

50
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,920
…to go out, to go out…

51
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,780
Nothing here…

52
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,660
It’s that hit-and-run ship!

53
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,400
Wait, wait!

54
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,400
Wait, wait!!

55
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,360
Wait, wait!!!

56
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,470
Smell…

57
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,810
Smell… food…

58
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,960
Food!

59
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,790
Gimme!

60
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,930
1,000 woolongs each, including tax.

61
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,100
Cash only. No money cards
or cash cards allowed.

62
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,830
I don’t have money.

63
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,710
Then hurry home, kid.

64
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,950
Can I have one?

65
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,860
1,000 woolongs each.
Cash only. Cards are…

66
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,120
Kid, no use staring.

67
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,530
If you want food,
go someplace like the town.

68
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,760
I don’t need change.

69
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,060
In exchange…

70
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,200
If you see this man, gimme a call.

71
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,210
Thanks!

72
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:18,980
Excuse us.

73
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,360
We would like to check your baggage.

74
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,690
Something wrong?

75
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,750
Apparently, a broker on
the wanted list for…

76
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,090
…illegal mushroom sales
made a getaway to this town.

77
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,390
What a coincidence.

78
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,590
I’m after that bounty as well.

79
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,190
A cowboy?

80
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,760
We’re gonna check out your trunk.

81
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,500
Go ahead, feel free.

82
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,610
Hey!

83
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,800
All right! Freeze!

84
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,940
—Now, wait a minute…
—All right, stay still…

85
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,240
—I don’t know anything about this!
—Turn around! Hands on the ground!

86
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,270
—What are you doing?!
—Now put your hands on the ground!

87
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,840
—Let go of me!!
—Hurry up!

88
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,910
Food, food, do you have any?

89
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,950
Oh, you don’t? Oh, you do?

90
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,820
Boy, am I hungry…

91
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,070
Meanie!

92
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,340
What?

93
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,370
Gimme!

94
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,440
Gimme something!

95
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,680
Dammit, stop hanging all over me!

96
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,080
Hey!

97
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,590
I won’t let you tell me you
forgot who I am, Domino!

98
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,850
Let’s see…

99
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,520
Come on! Remember, dammit!

100
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,760
I’m the younger of the Shaft brothers
that bought mushrooms from you!

101
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,320
I really can’t recall…

102
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,030
You do want to know why I drag an
empty coffin around like this, don’t you?

103
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,970
It’s because…

104
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,770
…I’m going to go home after
putting your corpse inside…

105
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,380
Pieces… All in pieces!

106
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,750
What was what to who?

107
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,380
My big bro ate a mushroom
he bought from you…

108
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,550
…and laughed and laughed,
and twisted his intestines to death!

109
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,060
A happy way to die.

110
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,420
Shut up!

111
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,590
Speaking of which,
it’s all your fault!

112
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,650
That’s what I call
an unjust resentment!

113
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,530
Ed is hungry, too!

114
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,420
Take this!

115
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,270
Wait, you bastard! Dammit!

116
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,540
Food!

117
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,340
Aah! Don’t, Ein! We have to share!

118
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,320
Ein?

119
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,120
Bad mushroom?

120
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,620
This for real?

121
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,860
Delicious!

122
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,230
This really can’t be happening.

123
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,570
Really…

124
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,980
This really has no way of happening.

125
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:16,210
Hey… You know, the world
really is a great place…

126
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,850
Did I just say something?

127
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,000
Hey, mister.

128
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,960
This is a stairway to heaven.
You know that, right?

129
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,200
An obnoxious little frog…

130
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,870
I don’t care anymore.
I warned you!

131
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,930
Yeah, yeah, that’s it.

132
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,910
I now know the secrets of the universe.

133
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,880
By the way…

134
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,720
…who was I?

135
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,160
So these mushrooms are
inedible after all…

136
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,260
<i>So, as you can tell, it’s time</i>
<i>for another episode of Big Shot!</i>

137
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,130
<i>We’ll introduce you to more</i>
<i>and more bounties this week!</i>

138
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,830
<i>So, batting first for us today…</i>

139
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,670
<i>… is this man, Domino Walker.</i>

140
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,510
<i>He’s currently wanted for</i>
<i>selling illegal mushrooms.</i>

141
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,910
—That’s the guy we just saw!
<i>—The bounty is a conservative 1.2 mil.</i>

142
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,040
That’s cowgirl, Ein.

143
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,640
We earn money, and buy food!

144
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,660
Ein, you’re a cow-woofwoof!

145
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,820
Here we go!

146
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,590
One!

147
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,330
Two!

148
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,060
Five!

149
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,930
Four!

150
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,230
Hello!

151
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,970
Hey, don’t underestimate the police!

152
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,010
I really don’t know anything!

153
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:33,580
Then why did you have a strange kid
and a dog in the trunk of your car?!

154
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,780
Hello… Yes?

155
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,190
Oh, it’s you, Sally.
Really… You’re so hopeless…

156
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,920
I told you so many times
not to call me at work…

157
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,830
And? Yeah yeah, and that’s it?

158
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,530
I mean, I didn’t mean it that
way when I said “that’s it?”…

159
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,870
Yeah, yeah, like that.
I love you, Sally.

160
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,170
Got it. Tonight at 7 it is. Bye-bye!

161
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,110
Hey!

162
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,690
What’s wrong, young’un?
Lookin’ like that…

163
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,160
Did your woman run off without you?

164
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,250
What to say…

165
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,920
None of your business, old geezers.

166
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,470
Oh, man… that’s for
eating all at once.

167
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,100
They say when you’re in
a hurry, go around.

168
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,340
Is that right?

169
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,840
He’s not here…

170
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,290
Aah! That hit-and-run ship!

171
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,540
I’m sure they never even dreamed
that I was raising these in here.

172
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,840
This one’s bad.

173
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,110
Well, making an emergency landing here
was the only miscalculation I had.

174
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,410
Were you surprised?

175
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,970
I was.

176
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,280
What the hell are you guys?

177
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,510
Why are you here?

178
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,490
That’s my line!

179
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,920
How did you get in here
in the first place?

180
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,250
—The door was open.
—Is that so?!

181
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,220
Culprit of the hit-and-run,
prepare to get arrested!

182
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,490
Stink bug gas!

183
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,660
Wait, wait, wait!

184
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,480
Don’t think that you
can get away from me!

185
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,130
Don’t get in my way!

186
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,150
Ein! Growl!

187
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,940
C-Come on! Let go of me!

188
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,190
Boo!

189
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,180
Gotcha!

190
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,470
W-Wait…

191
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,170
T-These mushrooms are
worth 100,000 each.

192
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,810
Let me go, and I’ll give them to you.

193
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,650
Why?

194
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,910
Think about which one is worth more.

195
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,050
I dunno.

196
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,650
A-Are you an idiot?!

197
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,050
Take the mushrooms!

198
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,290
Okay!

199
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:11,865
“Thanks”

200
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:13,700
“Oh, it’s no problem”

201
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,950
Yahoo! Dinner! Mushroom!

202
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,930
100,000 each? Really?

203
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,520
That sure would make some money.

204
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,030
These are real?

205
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,050
Excuse me.

206
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,900
I’m with the police.

207
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,530
I want to ask a few questions about
Domino, an illegal mushroom dealer.

208
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,240
Unfortunately, we have no clue.

209
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,510
I’m so sorry we can’t be of any help.

210
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,450
Ed knows who that… Mmf!

211
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,010
Don’t mind her…

212
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,210
In exchange, I got… Mmgh!

213
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,660
—Really…
—She’s a troublesome kid…

214
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,120
Excuse me, sir.

215
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,440
They’re okay.

216
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,040
He must really like shiitake mushrooms.

217
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,150
Well, sorry to bother you.

218
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,920
Here’s dinner.

219
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,430
What’s the menu?

220
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:52,200
Shiitake stir-fry, shiitake stew,
shiitake salad, and a shiitake dessert.

221
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,200
Yaaaaaay!

222
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,360
Again? How many days has it been?

223
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,370
No… I can’t eat anymore.

224
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,900
Quit complaining, and be
thankful that we can even eat!

225
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,140
Thankful!

226
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,330
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

227
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:35,670
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

228
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,370
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

229
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:48,110
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

230
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:57,360
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

231
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,370
The real folk blues.

232
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:10,780
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

233
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:18,410

235
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:31,830

236
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,450
COMING EPISODE

237
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,380
A videotape that was delivered to
the Bebop with no return address.

238
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,720
Because we wanted to view the tape,
things took a turn for the unexpected.

239
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,890
No, actually it doesn’t go anywhere.

240
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,900
At first glance,
the story is pointless…

241
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,400
…the actions are on a small scale…

242
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,560
…and the ending is forced…

243
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,300
…but what will you get out of it all?

244
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,030
Next episode: “Speak like a Child”.

245
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,480
At first glance, it’s interesting.

246
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,440
SPEAK LIKE A CHILD
At first glance, it’s interesting.

247
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:16,480
SPEAK LIKE A CHILD
