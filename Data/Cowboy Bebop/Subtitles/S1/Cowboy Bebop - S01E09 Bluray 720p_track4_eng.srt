1
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,670
<i>Here, nobody, here.</i>

2
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,730
<i>Always, alone.</i>

3
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,860
JAMMING WITH EDWARD

4
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,040
<i>38th district is sunny,</i>

5
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,380
<i>Slight rock showers.</i>

6
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,180
<i>Chance of rock showers today is 20%.</i>

7
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,560
<i>39th district is cloudy,</i>

8
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,030
<i>Chance of rock showers</i>
<i>this afternoon is 10%.</i>

9
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,810
Bebop, here, here! Welcome!

10
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,090
<i>Chance of rock showers today is 90%…</i>

11
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,640
<i>Now, it’s time for today’s news topics.</i>

12
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,740
<i>Today, we’ll discuss the</i>
<i>mysterious land paintings…</i>

13
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,850
<i>…that suddenly appeared in</i>
<i>what was South America.</i>

14
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,340
<i>As usual, we have commentaries by a
researcher of supernatural phenomena…</i>

15
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,150
<i>Me, Yuuri Kellerman.</i>

16
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,350
<i>Yuuri, about these land paintings…</i>

17
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:43,130
<i>Yes, yes. Well, I believe that it</i>
<i>was some sort of a message.</i>

18
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,040
<i>Um, who would it be from…?</i>
<i>Can it be…?</i>

19
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,800
<i>Aliens!</i>
<i>It has to be from aliens!</i>

20
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:56,070
<i>However, the land paintings were drawn</i>
<i>by lasers coming from satellites…</i>

21
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,350
<i>The police think it was a prank pulled</i>
<i>by a hacker who got into the satellite.</i>

22
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:06,450
<i>They already have a bounty of</i>
<i>8 million woolongs on the culprit…</i>

23
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,480
<i>Listen carefully, The bounty of 8 million</i>
<i>is a conspiracy of the government.</i>

24
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,550
<i>Even if it was drawn by a laser,</i>
<i>there is the possibility…</i>

25
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,130
<i>…that aliens put a message</i>
<i>into the brain of that hacker.</i>

26
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,340
<i>Once again, the government is</i>
<i>hiding something from us.</i>

27
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,710
<i>I see… A secret cult…</i>

28
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,230
<i>Yes! And that is the mystery that I
have been searching for all this time!</i>

29
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,650
I’ll pass on this one after all.

30
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,150
You’re leaving me alone with her?

31
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,880
Nothing wrong with it.
She’s gung-ho about it.

32
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,620
I’m not the type to be
led around by women.

33
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,090
Then lead her around.

34
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,320
I’m even less the type to do that.

35
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,790
It’s easier to…

36
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,770
…divide 8 million
between two than three.

37
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,270
Here we go.

38
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,970
I’m appalled. You’re afraid of hackers?

39
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,680
I just hate tedious work like that.

40
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,980
Guys cheap enough to hack into things
are depressed pale fatsos with glasses.

41
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,150
And I’m sure he’s a demented
otaku with smelly feet.

42
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,550
Piece of cake!

43
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,280
Do you have something
against someone like that?

44
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,190
I mean, they might’ve all been
like that when you were young…

45
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,630
You’re saying I look older than you?

46
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,530
You can’t tell a woman’s age
just by looking at her.

47
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,500
Exactly.

48
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,230
You can’t tell just by looking
that I can do things like this…

49
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,930
That’s all I know of you.

50
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,740
You guys make a good team.

51
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,610
Hurry up!

52
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,010
I’ll be waiting for
a souvenir from Earth.

53
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,410
There’s nothing made
on Earth that’s good.

54
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,280
<i>Well…</i>

55
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,310
<i>About this incident…</i>
<i>apparently, a pretty…</i>

56
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,290
<i>…old artificial satellite</i>
<i>has been hacked into.</i>

57
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,560
<i>The investigation is taking</i>
<i>longer than expected because…</i>

58
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,760
<i>…the access code to that</i>
<i>satellite has been long lost.</i>

59
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,000
<i>Now, a commentary from Mr. Amjad.</i>

60
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,830
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

61
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,960
<i>About the relationship between</i>
<i>Earth and the hacker…</i>

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,370
<i>Yes. Since the Gate</i>
<i>accident 50 years ago…</i>

63
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,710
<i>…the people of Earth have</i>
<i>migrated underground as a result…</i>

64
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,740
<i>…of the change in climate, namely,</i>
<i>moon rocks falling onto the planet.</i>

65
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,720
<i>To them, the ’space network’</i>
<i>created by computers is…</i>

66
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,250
<i>…necessary for them to stay in</i>
<i>contact with those living in space.</i>

67
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,750
<i>I see.</i>

68
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,590
<i>That’s becoming a foundation</i>
<i>to create outstanding hackers.</i>

69
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,530
Radical Edward!

70
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,300
It’s the police! Come out!

71
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,730
Yeah!

72
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,500
What? What’s wrong?

73
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,230
I saw it!

74
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,680
Why!?

75
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,450
There’s nobody in there!

76
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,670
Mistake, mistake.

77
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,510
Okay.

78
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,110
This is where the satellite
was when it was hacked.

79
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,090
This is where it could
be accessed from.

80
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,260
I’ll look at all the antennae that
can transmit light signals one by one.

81
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,420
I’ll ask around for info on any
prominent hackers in the area.

82
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,820
Bebop’s lookin’ for
land picture criminal…

83
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,010
All right!

84
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,160
Satellite of long, long ago…

85
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,060
Where in the world
is your access code?

86
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,170
Okay. Let’s start with all the antennae
that are currently communicating…

87
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,750
That’s probably Ed, man.

88
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,390
I hear he’s a huge guy, 2 meters tall.

89
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,230
Supposedly, he used to
be a basketball player.

90
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,060
Yeah, I know Ed.

91
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,570
Radical Edward.

92
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,600
I hear she’s a very beautiful
yet whimsical hacker.

93
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,200
No, no, that hacker is a child.

94
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,410
A brat that loves
horrible pranks, I hear.

95
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:42,910
Oh, what I heard from the lady next
door is that that hacker is gay.

96
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,990
Hacker? You mean Ed?

97
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,550
He’s an alien!

98
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,260
That’s what everyone says!

99
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,870
Hey, man!

100
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,540
Can you buy some of this
as the price for the info?

101
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,770
What is that?

102
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,370
You don’t know?

103
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,010
It’s “Piyoko,” a well-known
specialty of Earth!

104
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,980
The stolen satellites…

105
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,920
Where are you?

106
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,130
Huh? What’s this?

107
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,730
The information isn’t
connected to Earth.

108
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,240
It’s connected only
between satellites.

109
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,870
And nobody hacked into it…

110
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,670
<i>Here, nobody, here.</i>

111
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,580
<i>Always, alone.</i>

112
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,250
A voice… inside… head…

113
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,900
Who are you?

114
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,930
Eh? What? What did you just say?

115
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,410
<i>Who, you? Here, always.</i>

116
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,210
Edward. A ’net diver from Earth.

117
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,340
<i>Earth?</i>

118
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,870
Yup. Hey, what’s your name?

119
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:23,850
<i>I am the satellite control program</i>
<i>on the D-135 artificial satellite.</i>

120
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,880
What’s that? Don’t you have a nickname?

121
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,230
Then Ed will give you one.

122
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,530
I know!

123
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,260
Because you’re a computer,
you can be MPU!

124
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,940
MPU! Cool name!

125
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,310
<i>Um…</i>

126
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,510
Ed is Edward Wong Hau
Pepelu Tivrusky the fourth.

127
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,910
Ed for short.

128
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,780
Nice to meet you!

129
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,240
Here. A souvenir from Earth.

130
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,710
Is this food?

131
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,220
It makes me doubt that
they have any sense.

132
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,880
Unlike you, I learned some information.

133
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,660
They said that an unknown hacker named
Radical Edward is the suspicious one.

134
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,860
It doesn’t mean anything
if he’s unknown.

135
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,760
I know, more or less.

136
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,460
It seems okay.

137
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,530
What kinda thing is it?

138
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,240
2 meters tall. Ex-basketball player.
Beautiful kid.

139
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,310
And on top of it, a gay alien.

140
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,680
Why did you doodle on Earth?

141
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,030
<i>Long, long ago,</i>
<i>long before the Gate accident…</i>

142
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,990
<i>Earth was a beautiful planet</i>
<i>where many people lived.</i>

143
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,440
<i>And back then on Earth,</i>
<i>there were many…</i>

144
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,200
<i>…pictures like this,</i>
<i>and I always looked at them.</i>

145
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,580
<i>I remembered those times…</i>

146
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,340
<i>…and I tried to recreate</i>
<i>at least the pictures.</i>

147
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,590
I see, doodles like this were
on Earth long ago, too…

148
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,650
<i>Yes. I recreated them with</i>
<i>a 2% margin of error.</i>

149
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,790
MPU is good at drawing.
Can Ed draw something, too?

150
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,020
Huh? What’s wrong?

151
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,090
<i>This is…</i>

152
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,830
<i>The police are putting</i>
<i>out a jamming signal.</i>

153
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,500
Hey! MPU! He-e-e-y!

154
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:24,370
Looks like the cops touched base
with Radical Edward as well.

155
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,610
<i>Listen! I found your bounty</i>

156
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,520
What the?

157
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,280
<i>Bebop!</i>

158
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,750
<i>The real culprit in the</i>
<i>satellite-jacking wasn’t a hacker!</i>

159
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,820
Since when do we have
an interactive channel?

160
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,330
No, that’s not it.

161
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,330
This is a real-time hack job.

162
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,830
Who is this kid?

163
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,200
<i>I’ll send you MPU’s data now.</i>

164
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,370
Wait a minute, what is MPU?

165
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,960
<i>A friend of Ed’s.</i>

166
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,170
Hey, do you know Ed?

167
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,940
<i>Yeah, because Ed is Ed.</i>

168
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,250
I don’t care about that. Who did it?

169
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,150
<i>Um… I could tell you.</i>

170
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,250
<i>But I have a favor to ask in return.</i>

171
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,750
A favor?

172
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,890
Yeah, yeah.
Yer big sister will listen to ya later.

173
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,620
Come on, hurry it up.

174
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:22,390
I see. The A.I. from the abandoned
satellite is doodling of its own will.

175
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,730
What? What’s up?

176
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,740
And on top of that,
it was supposedly listed as…

177
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,870
…a weather satellite,
so nobody suspected anything.

178
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,810
Then this satellite is our bounty?

179
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,810
<i>Since the access code to</i>
<i>MPU can’t be used anymore…</i>

180
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,910
<i>…you need to go directly,</i>
<i>to the satellite.</i>

181
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,480
And what do we do?

182
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,150
<i>Break the antennae that it uses to</i>
<i>communicate with the other satellites.</i>

183
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,130
<i>Then make a direct connection</i>
<i>to the satellite and download MPU.</i>

184
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,690
<i>And when you do, don’t use computer</i>
<i>support for firing or flying.</i>

185
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,140
What? All manual?

186
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,540
<i>Yup. If it notices you,</i>
<i>all the attack satellites…</i>

187
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,700
<i>…connected to MPU will</i>
<i>automatically fire back.</i>

188
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,480
<i>Is this hard?</i>

189
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,710
It’s not just hard,
it’s downright impossible.

190
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,240
It’s like playing baseball with no bat!

191
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,290
Hey, Spike.

192
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,990
That’s the kind of stuff I like.

193
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,070
Hey! Wait, you.
How do you know about us?

194
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,500
<i>I know everything.</i>

195
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,430
Last week, you let Ajiz, a bounty on
Mars worth 1.5 million, get away…

196
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,810
And in Pyortle before that,
the police got to them first…

197
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,810
Are you really that
hacker Radical Edward!?

198
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,250
Yeah. You’ve heard?

199
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:54,090
<i>Connect D-7 to #2. That way, the main</i>
<i>cannon will fire without a computer.</i>

200
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,430
I’m trusting you, man…

201
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,560
<i>Now listen. Avoid using the missile</i>
<i>if you can help it. It’s expensive.</i>

202
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,860
Roger.

203
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,030
<i>1200 to target.</i>

204
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,130
It’s almost time to
cut off computer controls.

205
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,110
Now, the only chance…

206
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,300
Once is enough.

207
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,020
<i>Anyway, you can prove</i>
<i>that the satellite itself…</i>

208
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,150
<i>…and not a hacker,</i>
<i>is the bounty, right?</i>

209
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,150
Ed can do that.

210
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,850
Anyway, please, listen to my favor.

211
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,260
Then I’ll give you all the bounty, too.

212
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,950
Oh, you’re a surprisingly good kid!

213
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,100
That’s it?

214
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,690
<i>Someone…</i>

215
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,000
How was it?

216
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,000
Did you get it?

217
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:12,960
No, I missed!

218
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,480
The satellite in front
of it shielded the blast!

219
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,680
Then you have to shoot
down all the satellites!

220
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,940
All of them!?

221
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,350
If you don’t, they’ll shoot us down!

222
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,790
ECM, eh?

223
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,260
Cheap ones are no good after all…

224
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,470
This is getting pointless.

225
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,640
<i>Approach to within 20 meters of MPU!</i>

226
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,620
<i>That way, the other</i>
<i>satellites can’t attack!</i>

227
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,640
However…

228
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,950
<i>Until then, Faye will act as a decoy.</i>

229
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,850
Me!?

230
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,350
Yeah, thanks!

231
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,320
Come on, hurry up!

232
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,550
All right, it’s all yours!

233
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,290
MPU!

234
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,070
MPU? MPU!?

235
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,100
<i>Oh, Ed!</i>

236
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,430
<i>Ed, we meet again.</i>

237
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,170
They have a bounty on you, MPU.

238
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,470
<i>Bounty?</i>

239
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:00,210
Yup, but if we copy you and let
them catch that, you’ll be all right.

240
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,710
<i>All right?</i>

241
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,740
And you must be lonely
there alone, MPU.

242
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,810
If you come over here,
there are lots of friends.

243
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,350
<i>Friends?</i>

244
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,880
Here. It’s not scary.

245
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,670
<i>And so, the strange end to this case.</i>

246
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,570
<i>The captured criminal was</i>
<i>the A.I. program for…</i>

247
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,140
<i>…a spy satellite that was launched</i>
<i>before the Earth was ruined.</i>

248
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,610
<i>According to government sources</i>
<i>from back then, it supposedly would…</i>

249
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:40,210
<i>…continue activity on its own</i>
<i>even without commands from Earth.</i>

250
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:46,450
Well, it was the perfect excuse for
the cops to go on a hacker hunt.

251
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:53,500
But anyway, why did it start doodling on
the Earth with a laser all of a sudden?

252
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,560
I’m sure…

253
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,630
…that was because it got lonely.

254
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,900
Yoohoo! Bebop!

255
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,710
Hey, over here! Hurry!

256
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,970
<i>Promise, promise!</i>

257
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,350
Well, let’s get going now!

258
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,850
But the kid is saying
something about a promise…

259
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,580
Promises are made to be broken.

260
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,950
Anyway, let’s get going! Liftoff!

261
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,700
Not coming, not coming.

262
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,450
What is this? What’s going on!?

263
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,950
What did you promise?

264
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,600
It’s a promise…
to be a member of the Bebop.

265
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,030
<i>Amigo! All you bounty hunters!</i>

266
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,740
<i>It’s finally time for Big Shot!</i>

267
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,980
<i>Now, today’s hot news.</i>

268
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,310
<i>You’ve heard about the doodling</i>
<i>satellite that got caught, right?</i>

269
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,410
<i>Of course! It had a big bounty on it!</i>

270
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,560
<i>Just a few moments ago, the Earth</i>
<i>police made an official report.</i>

271
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,190
<i>What was it?</i>

272
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,600
<i>“This bounty is only for when humans</i>
<i>or other life forms are the targets.”</i>

273
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,670
<i>“It is difficult to determine whether or</i>
<i>not a computer program is a life form.”</i>

274
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,670
<i>“To begin with, from the viewpoint</i>
<i>of biological logistics</i>…”

275
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,240
<i>What’s that? I don’t understand well.</i>

276
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,910
<i>In other words, they can’t</i>
<i>pay up on nonliving things!</i>

277
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,920
<i>Oh, my</i>

278
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,250
<i>To those who caught it,</i>
<i>I feel sorry for you!</i>

279
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,290
Hey, Jet, did you know that there
are three things that I hate?

280
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,030
Whatever…

281
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,990
Rugrats…

282
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,130
…beasts…

283
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,990
…and tomboys.

284
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,000
Don’t give me that!

285
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,100
Why do we have all three
neatly gathered here!?

286
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,110
Ed loves Piyokos!

287
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,610
And once again we
didn’t get any bounty…

288
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,080
Hey, wait, you’re a girl?

289
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,880
Really, nothing good comes outta Earth!

290
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,670
COMING EPISODE

291
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,770
No regrets about the
woman who ran away…

292
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,170
…but a small thorn
still pricks the heart.

293
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,010
Letting one flow along
with time itself…

294
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,640
…living all alone from
that day to this.

295
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,050
But to the sounds of
waves that come and go…

296
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,640
…the migrating birds
find their hearts drawn.

297
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,180
Next episode: “Ganymede Elegy.”

298
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,690
Jet Black will sing it up full of soul.

299
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,250
GANYMEDE ELEGY
Jet Black will sing it up full of soul.

300
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,700
GANYMEDE ELEGY
