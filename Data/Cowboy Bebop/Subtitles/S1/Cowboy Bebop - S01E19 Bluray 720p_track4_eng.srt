1
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,720
WILD HORSES

2
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,680
Really, this just
doesn’t suit my style…

3
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,380
…to just sit and wait like this.

4
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,550
We pick our spot, then wait patiently.

5
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,850
That is the secret behind fishing.

6
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,420
<i>Did you ever consider that maybe</i>
<i>this was the wrong spot?</i>

7
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,360
The bait has no right to complain.

8
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,130
What are you fishing for?

9
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,070
“Starship Pirates.” A group that
calls themselves pirates.

10
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,330
Pirates?

11
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,410
A group of people that
like to attack a ship…

12
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,380
…and rob anything and
everything from them.

13
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,340
Like to rob, rob, drunken slob!

14
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,350
<i>Besides, where the hell did Spike go?!</i>

15
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,940
<i>He left to overhaul his ship,</i>
<i>and still hasn’t…</i>

16
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,420
Thanks.

17
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,360
But Spike… Man…

18
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,360
What’s he doing now,
without giving us a heads-up?

19
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,340
You’re late, Doohan!

20
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,360
Yeah! Go, go, go!!

21
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,520
Hey?

22
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,290
Hey!

23
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,160
<i>Strike three! Batter out!</i>

24
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,470
<i>He just let that one slide by…</i>
<i>and that’s the game!</i>

25
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,720
Man!

26
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,240
Why didn’t they just
send in a pinch-hitter?

27
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,000
Come on, Eightwood is getting old!

28
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,970
Don’t ya think?

29
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,410
Where’s Doohan?

30
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,310
The old man’s kinda busy right now.

31
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,110
I’m Miles, his assistant.
Nice to meet ya.

32
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,250
Man, they were really great when
they won the pennant 14 years ago.

33
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,560
They just kept hittin’ the ball one after
another, and turned losing games around!

34
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,470
Especially when Randy, Blanket,
and Hills hit consecutive homers!

35
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,970
I really wish you coulda seen it.

36
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,230
And ya know…

37
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,180
Hey, do people often say
you’re the silent type?

38
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,620
And people often say you
talk too much, right?

39
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,110
Kinda.

40
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,180
The… Swordfish, right?

41
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,090
The machine back there…

42
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,250
Yeah.

43
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,850
That’s the amazing mono-racer
that the old man built, right?

44
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,210
It’s just an old machine.
I don’t want it, but it’s a part of me.

45
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,660
I hear ya…

46
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,030
Us Blue Sox fans feel like we
fell for some wicked broad.

47
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,330
Really! I can’t remember how many times
I’ve thought about giving up on them!

48
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,060
Jesus, not again…

49
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,320
Yo, old man!

50
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,510
Yo. Long time no see.

51
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,480
Yeah.

52
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,270
Miles, where’s the checklist?!

53
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,440
It’s out there!

54
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,070
I put it on the ship’s body!

55
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,940
He’s been fixing that ancient thing?

56
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,320
I think it’s useless.

57
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,020
The computer isn’t compatible
with the mono-system.

58
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,420
Miles! Gimme the EV Transmitter,
the absorber for the main gear…

59
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,400
…and the three-eight pneumatic tube!

60
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,260
A three-eight?!
I don’t have something that special!

61
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,730
Order one from Reggie.
His place has them!

62
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,170
Yeah, yeah. You really
are some slave driver!

63
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,650
Some hobby!

64
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,820
Did we catch it?

65
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,750
It wasn’t me! Where is it?

66
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,450
It’s close! Shit, I used bad bait!

67
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,180
Hey!

68
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,730
This is a good machine.

69
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,040
Attacking blessed people like
them and giving to the poor…

70
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,700
<i>…is human equality,</i>
<i>Don’t you think so?</i>

71
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,500
Heh, heh, I get it.

72
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,140
This is what ya call social reform.

73
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,780
<i>Yeah. It’s only right for us,</i>
<i>the poor, to take from them!</i>

74
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,780
Something’s coming!

75
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,580
Cops?!

76
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,080
Hi.

77
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,580
<i>That’s enough.</i>

78
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,950
Bounty-hunter?

79
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:40,720
Harman.

80
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,790
Be a good girl and come here…

81
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,730
Faye, above you!

82
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,540
What the?! Is this a joke?!

83
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,680
It’s not me!

84
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,880
Ruth! One more behind us!

85
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,310
<i>And it’s huge!</i>

86
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,850
I know.

87
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,010
What a tattered old ship!

88
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,280
Leave me alone!

89
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,440
<i>Abnormality found in the mono-system.</i>
<i>Booting the emergency pilot program.</i>

90
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,210
<i>Hey, stop this thing!</i>

91
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,850
<i>Like I know how!</i>

92
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,530
Looks like he’s taken
you on quite a few spins.

93
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,590
Cut it!

94
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,700
The accelerator pump is all worn down.

95
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,750
I know.

96
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,680
And the fuel injector doesn’t
have a silencer on it…

97
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,340
Don’t need one.

98
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,680
But it’s noisy, and it trembles…

99
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,690
If you put one in, then I can’t
hear what it’s telling me!

100
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,350
Just hurry up and connect the injector.

101
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,600
First of all, a three-eight
isn’t popular anymore.

102
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,960
Why don’t you switch to
the new five-zero?

103
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,340
Miles.

104
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,210
And if you change the
navigation to full-auto…

105
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,760
…then you can glide
along without manual steering…

106
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,870
Do you want to use a machine,
or do you want the machine to use you?

107
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,780
Which is it?

108
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,980
I wasn’t exactly…

109
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,450
Just go!

110
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,020
You haven’t changed a bit.

111
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,120
At this rate, another assistant
is gonna leave you.

112
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,100
And you! The Swordfish wants
to run away from you!

113
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,430
I haven’t heard that before.

114
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,370
If you keep being reckless with her,
she’ll really throw you off someday!

115
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,540
Unfortunately, I’m not
one for delicate controls.

116
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,920
Sorry to keep you waiting!

117
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,110
I got something you don’t see often…
A three-eight pneumatic tube!

118
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,990
Yes, hello?

119
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,090
Oh, it’s you, Missing Man.
Where are you right now?

120
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,940
I’m still with Doohan. How’s Jet?

121
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,870
<i>He seems rather busy right now…</i>

122
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,070
Saying something about some bacteria…

123
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,340
Bacteria?!

124
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,580
A virus!
We got a computer virus!

125
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,040
Same difference.

126
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,210
Starting with the mono-system,
orbit calculator…

127
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,720
…flight path selector, engine
regulator, communications circuit…

128
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,790
<i>…they’re all shot.</i>

129
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,330
I don’t get it.
Gimme a simple explanation.

130
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,790
The computer broke and we’re
just drifting along!

131
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,770
Well, I understood that.

132
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,740
How about it? It’s the newest one.

133
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,970
You haven’t seen one floating
around anywhere else, right?

134
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,800
A mono-computer?

135
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,210
How about it? 150K… No, 100K.

136
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,600
A bargain, huh?

137
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,940
When it’s sold that cheap,
you lose money even on salvage.

138
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,420
So, who did it?

139
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,110
Where did you get this?

140
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,020
A truck? Any features?

141
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:02,780
A penguin…

142
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,520
…logo on…

143
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,460
…the delivery truck?!

144
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,430
Are you sure about the info?

145
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,370
Yeah. They apparently were
dealing at the Orbit Drive-in.

146
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,010
I see… nobody would be suspicious
of a delivery truck wandering about.

147
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,380
And how are we going
to counter the hacks?

148
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,340
Don’t get harpooned!

149
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:38,980
…and?

150
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,290
That’s it?!

151
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,290
They laughed this ship
off as “tattered!”

152
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,500
And they made that mess
out of my Hammerhead!

153
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,900
Unlike someone I know,
I always pay back what I owe.

154
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,230
What a wonderful principle.

155
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,640
I’m really not up for this…

156
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,940
I have an invoice from Doohan here.

157
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,320
Because they’re physically
sending the virus…

158
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,650
…they haven’t developed
a vaccine for it.

159
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,720
That is where this secret
weapon of ours comes in.

160
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,460
What? That’s just our
normal communicator.

161
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,300
If you get infected by the virus,
cut off the entire mono-system.

162
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
Then, all navigation and
communication will go down.

163
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,070
As I said…
I will navigate you with this.

164
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,870
Because this is set to the frequency
for an old communications satellite…

165
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,850
…it has nothing to
do with the mono-system.

166
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,020
<i>Oh, another run scored</i>
<i>against the Blue Sox!</i>

167
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,060
That’s some secret weapon…

168
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,650
It was a penguin, right?

169
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,390
Yeah. A purple penguin.

170
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,030
There are two of them?

171
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,160
Wait a minute, it might be
a real courier service.

172
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,570
It’s a matter of how to
figure out if they are legit…

173
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,370
That’s easy.

174
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,840
We fire a shot, and the one
that runs is the one we want.

175
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,340
This is the first time
I agree with you on something.

176
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,650
Y-You guys!

177
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,880
What are you gonna do
if they’re both real?!

178
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,830
<i>They both ran?</i>

179
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,230
<i>We didn’t consider that option…</i>

180
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,770
I’m trusting you with that one!

181
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,130
I have to pay them
back for yesterday, too.

182
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,650
Forgive us!

183
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,590
W-We’ll pay the parking fee!

184
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,300
This way?!

185
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,000
<i>Spike! Draw them out!</i>

186
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,170
<i>It’ll be a mess if they,</i>
<i>let the virus go in there!</i>

187
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,640
<i>I know!</i>

188
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,600
So, let’s see what ya got…

189
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,840
He’s here.

190
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,780
Waste of time.

191
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,530
He’s after the arm…

192
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,690
He’s not taking us seriously! Ruth!

193
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,190
Ready to go anytime.

194
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,770
Take that!

195
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,600
Welcome…

196
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,110
Excellent!

197
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,270
Bingo!

198
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,080
He’s holding up pretty well.

199
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,700
Cut off the mono-system!

200
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,420
I’m doing it!

201
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,910
That idiot cut off his mono-system!

202
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,170
Hey… George…

203
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,570
And he’s in Earth’s
gravitational field…

204
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,740
Old man! Here, here!

205
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,620
—This is pretty bad!
<i>—Align the D7. Ya did it before, right?</i>

206
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,660
<i>Like I remember!</i>

207
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,490
No good!
There’s nothing we can do!

208
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,670
You idiot! Hurry up and
do something about this!

209
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,400
Dammit… Move! Move!!

210
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,840
Falling… We’re falling!

211
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,270
Spike, I’ll be right there.

212
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,800
<i>I’m calculating an</i>
<i>interception course.</i>

213
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,540
<i>Until then, somehow</i>
<i>keep control manually,</i>

214
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,980
<i>Even if everything was normal,</i>
<i>it’d be tough to get outta here.</i>

215
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,250
I can see that.

216
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,230
And I just had it overhauled…

217
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,390
Oh, well. Whatever happens, happens.

218
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,970
<i>Spike, above you.</i>

219
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,980
Your tattered ship
looks like a goddess!

220
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,120
Shit, the virus…

221
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,560
Spike!

222
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,740
<i>I’m still alive!</i>

223
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,700
<i>We have to start over!</i>

224
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,740
No way! Old man, ya gotta be kidding!

225
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,810
Are you really gonna move
this ancient piece of…

226
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,750
Do you think I’d do this as a joke?

227
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,350
Don’t just stand there!
Hurry up and get me some fuel!

228
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,420
All right!

229
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,870
Spike, can you hear me?
I got a calculation.

230
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,060
It’ll take another 7 hours
for us to rendezvous.

231
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,330
Come on, you’re joking, right?

232
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,040
<i>We’re too close to Earth. The orbital</i>
<i>paths I can take are limited!</i>

233
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,270
<i>Isn’t there a way for</i>
<i>you to just swing on by?</i>

234
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,110
<i>If I plunge in at this</i>
<i>angle, both the…</i>

235
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,840
<i>…Bebop and the Swordfish</i>
<i>will burn to nothing!</i>

236
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,920
Jet…

237
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,500
<i>I have some booze hidden</i>
<i>behind the fridge.</i>

238
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,910
<i>Feel free to drink some.</i>

239
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,980
Something wrong?!

240
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,710
I’m outta gas.
Nothing I can do now.

241
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,010
<i>How about I go there and tow you back,</i>
<i>in exchange for that booze?</i>

242
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,240
I heard the conversation.
Give me the Swordfish’s coordinates.

243
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,460
Doohan?!
How the hell do you?!

244
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,750
<i>Spike, I don’t care how ya do it,</i>
<i>but slow down using an air-brake.</i>

245
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,580
Slow down?

246
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,410
If you slow down within
Earth’s atmosphere…

247
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,510
…the gravitational pull
will accelerate you instead…

248
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,630
<i>…which will give you</i>
<i>enough speed to escape.</i>

249
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,360
<i>However, you have to maintain</i>
<i>the ship at a certain angle.</i>

250
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,690
<i>Too far either way,</i>
<i>and you’ll be…</i>

251
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,490
<i>…thrown out to the other</i>
<i>end of the universe.</i>

252
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,560
Unfortunately, I’m not
one for delicate controls.

253
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,190
<i>Spike…</i>

254
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,800
I know you can do it.

255
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,470
I didn’t give you the
Swordfish for nothing.

256
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,910
Don’t you start crashing, either!

257
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,120
Maximum propulsion.

258
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,160
You didn’t have to force
yourself to come with me.

259
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,630
You know how Blue Sox
fans love to party!

260
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,640
Let’s go!

261
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,470
All right!

262
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,500
We’re flying…

263
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,230
We’re really flying!

264
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,950
<i>Lower the nose by 0.6 degrees.</i>

265
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,220
<i>You’re in too deep!</i>

266
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,160
<i>Spike, you’ll burn to a crisp!</i>

267
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,360
<i>This is the last chance!</i>

268
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,850
It went in! It went in!

269
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,910
That was perfect!

270
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,400
Doohan, you saved me.

271
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,620
<i>Not quite.</i>

272
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,330
Most of the heat-resistant
tiles have peeled off.

273
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,590
The temperature is rising…

274
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,960
<i>T-The landing gear isn’t</i>
<i>coming down either!</i>

275
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,030
<i>Oh yeah, and the #2 nozzle</i>
<i>won’t work either.</i>

276
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,010
<i>What?! Is that for real?</i>
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

277
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,210
<i>—We can’t land without them!</i>
—Oh, well… Whatever happens, happens.

278
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,910
<i>I knew I shouldn’t have come up here!</i>
<i>I’m still too young to die!</i>

279
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:41,340
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

280
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:47,680
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

281
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,380
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

282
00:22:53,420 --> 00:23:00,120
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

283
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:09,370
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

284
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,380
The real folk blues.

285
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:22,790
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

286
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:30,420
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

287
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,920
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

288
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:43,840
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

289
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,810
