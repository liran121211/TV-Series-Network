1
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,220
S-Since when were you…

2
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,890
Water sploosh…

3
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,730
You know this?

4
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,100
I think I know, I don’t think I know.

5
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,660
I don’t think I know that I know.

6
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,010
I think I know even though
I don’t think I know…

7
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,780
Which is it?!

8
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,880
Hey!

9
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,690
HARD LUCK WOMAN

10
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,550
Hey Spike, where the hell are we?!

11
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,740
Isn’t it Earth?

12
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,220
Earth?!

13
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,720
Hey, this ship was headed for Mars!

14
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,020
Why the hell are we on
Earth all of a sudden?!

15
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,320
Dunno.

16
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,090
Shit, this isn’t funny.

17
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,860
While we’re wasting time,
our fugitive!

18
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,860
It was the first big one in a while.

19
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,670
In any case why the hell are we on?

20
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,230
Jet.

21
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,430
The women are gone.

22
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,540
<i>Listen, if you lead me to</i>
<i>that “water sploosh” place…</i>

23
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,640
<i>…I’ll give you something good.</i>

24
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,280
<i>Good thing? What?</i>

25
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,350
Something very, tremendously,
wonderfully good.

26
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,080
Something very, tremendously,
wonderfully good!

27
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,290
Hot!

28
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,190
Hot! Hot! Hot!

29
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,750
This!

30
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,750
Water sploosh!

31
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,990
I knew I shouldn’t have trusted you…

32
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,490
Hey, I found Ed!

33
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,500
Ed has been found?

34
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,700
What, you know them?

35
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,040
35 point 38 point 0, 35 point
48 point 1, 35 point 48 point 2…

36
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,170
This!

37
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,900
This, this, this!

38
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,500
Hey, can I have your nails?

39
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,350
Nails?

40
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,750
I’m collecting them!

41
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,680
Can I, please?

42
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,150
—Just the pinky one will do!
—35 point 52 point 3, 35 point…

43
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,740
This, this!

44
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,880
—Come on… can I have it? Please?
—What are you guys?!

45
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,050
Hey!

46
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,030
Ed?!

47
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,200
Is that really you… Ed?

48
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,420
I’m sorry about that.

49
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,620
That’s the best way
to make the kids listen.

50
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,490
It’s all right.

51
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,420
Is Ed from this place?

52
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,630
She wandered in about five years ago.

53
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,030
Before I knew it, she was eating with
us as if it had always been that way.

54
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,730
And about three years ago,
she wandered away.

55
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,710
As if she was a cat or something.

56
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,770
I was wondering how she
was doing nowadays…

57
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,040
…but I didn’t think she
would suddenly appear.

58
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,610
All right, it’s time to eat!

59
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,920
Dear Lord up in the heavens…

60
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,360
Never mind the rest.
Let’s eat!

61
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,730
Let’s eat!

62
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,800
I have to get going now…

63
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,070
What, you can stay longer, right?

64
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,700
I’m actually looking for something…

65
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,440
Ed knows where it is.

66
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,950
We just came here for food.

67
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,450
You…

68
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,220
You have to gimme something good!

69
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,760
Oh yeah, Ed.

70
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,190
There’s something good in
the desk drawer over there.

71
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,560
Something good?

72
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,000
Go get it.

73
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,830
Something good!

74
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,800
Inside that drawer.

75
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,210
Not that.

76
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,040
Yeah, that. Open it!

77
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,220
Her father.

78
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,650
Whose?

79
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,520
He came looking for Ed
about 2 months ago.

80
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,020
He said he forgot that he
had put her in an orphanage…

81
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,900
…and that he had been looking for
7 years, hopping around the world.

82
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,060
I hope she will be able to meet him…

83
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,340
People have to cherish
what ties they have…

84
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,650
Yeah!

85
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,640
Are you… Faye?

86
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,640
Impossible…

87
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,200
Really?

88
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,150
It’s me, Sally Yung!

89
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,870
I was in your high school
graduating class!

90
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,280
Are you all right?

91
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,830
I was really surprised.

92
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,490
I thought you were a ghost.
You look just like back then…

93
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,240
You know, they say ghosts appear in
places where they have regrets…

94
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,100
Oh, yeah, I remember now.

95
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,540
You were put in cold sleep
after that accident.

96
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,410
And that’s why you
look like back then…

97
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,340
Accident?

98
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,470
You don’t remember, Faye?

99
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,440
I-I…

100
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,950
Grandma!

101
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,290
Grandma, we gotta go back now.

102
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,760
Is it that time already?

103
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,840
Do you know who this is?

104
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,970
I bet you don’t know.
Actually, she’s…

105
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,010
…a ghost.

106
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,880
Good-bye. Take care.

107
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,680
Hey, you guys!

108
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,520
What’s with this course
change without asking?!

109
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,250
Our plans have all been
screwed because of it!

110
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,190
I don’t appreciate you
doing things on your own!

111
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,540
You want to smell
something really good?

112
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,690
What’s with them?

113
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,890
What are they being
so secretive about?

114
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,930
Leave them alone.

115
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,160
Maybe they’re too hungry
for their own good…

116
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,640
Humans go insane if
they don’t eat food.

117
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,580
50 million?

118
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,150
I see… pretty big.

119
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,340
Appledelhi Siniz Hesap Lutfen.

120
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,930
Would you like one, Mackenroe?

121
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,550
That’s McIntire.

122
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,890
No thank you, Mr. Appledelhi.

123
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,400
You sure? Eggs are good.

124
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,240
As they say, power and charge.
That’s what’s important, Macintosh.

125
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,000
That’s McIntire.

126
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,600
Why is it that you can’t ever
remember your assistant’s name?

127
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,410
Hm, don’t worry about
the small things in life.

128
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,120
Hurry, Macky-Mike!

129
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,320
That’s McIntire!!

130
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,410
Watch where you’re going!

131
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,080
Hey?

132
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,590
Sorry…

133
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,640
Sorry?

134
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,520
I-I…

135
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,530
I have to go…

136
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,570
Going out?
Where are you going?

137
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,050
I finally remembered where I belong.

138
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,010
Where you belong?

139
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,790
You have someone waiting for you, too.
You have somewhere you belong.

140
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,060
You should go look for it, too.

141
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,390
That’s the best thing, you know…

142
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,710
This one is a piece of cake.

143
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,770
50 million is right there!

144
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,950
If they can eat sukiyaki
filled with meat, then they…

145
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,660
Faye went out.

146
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,780
Again?

147
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,220
Where the hell did she go this time?

148
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,160
A woman’s heart and
the skies of Ganymede, was it?

149
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,530
You’re Appledelhi?

150
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,970
Can you come along with us?

151
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,210
Cooperate with us if you
don’t wanna get hurt.

152
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,040
Who are you guys?
Don’t interrupt our work!

153
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,280
Work?

154
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,220
What does this Earth need
to regain a peaceful peace?

155
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,490
This Earth of wild chaos!
Is it the cosmos?

156
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,000
That is a map! A map!

157
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,190
Yes, happiness comes in
the form of a map!

158
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,470
We are creating maps to save the Earth!

159
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,970
A map?

160
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,670
But, meteors fall often
and change the landscape.

161
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,450
That’s why we’re globetrotting.
We’re chasing after every meteor!

162
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,110
Until every single meteor
falls onto Earth!

163
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,750
Enough with the excuses!

164
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,160
You!

165
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,420
I wasn’t expecting someone this adept.

166
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,010
Is that you, Ed?!

167
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,460
That’s enough! Stop!

168
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,040
Françoise!

169
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,850
How’s that?

170
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,510
And that, and that?

171
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,550
This is father-person.

172
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,420
Father?

173
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,930
Your father?

174
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,530
She had such a thing?

175
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,800
This is Spike-person and Jet-person.

176
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,060
I see.

177
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,370
No, father. Good people.

178
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,500
Oh? I see.

179
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,250
Thank you for taking care of my son.

180
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,320
Or was it daughter?

181
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,220
Oh well, it’s all right either way.

182
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,220
That’s a token of my appreciation.

183
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,190
Then Ed, were you the one
who put the bounty on?

184
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:47,160
Fifty point zero, zero,
zero, zero, zero, zero?

185
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,630
Only 50 Woolongs?

186
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,230
So, you wanna come with me?

187
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,180
Hurry, Michael-duck!

188
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,680
That’s McIntire!!

189
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,740
Hey, wait!

190
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,750
Father!

191
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,390
He’s gone.

192
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,020
Hey, it’s dinner time…

193
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,470
Spike, dinner.

194
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,450
You can’t come with me, Ein.

195
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,590
Ed is going someplace far, far away.

196
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,360
I might not be coming back.

197
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,760
So Ein, you should go back home.

198
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,260
Do you want to come with Ed?

199
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,220
Let’s go, Ein!

200
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,660
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

201
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:55,000
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

202
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,700
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

203
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:07,440
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

204
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:16,690
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

205
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,700
The real folk blues.

206
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:30,110
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

207
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:37,740
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

208
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,240
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

209
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:51,160

Everything has a beginning…
and an end.
COMING EPISODE

212
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,160
Everything has a beginning…
and an end.

213
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,200
Life is just a cycle of them.

214
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:22,070
With unwanted endings, becoming an adult
is to experience the inevitable finale.

215
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,150
It’s been a fast trip for Bebop,
with only two episodes left.

216
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,380
But make sure you pay
close attention to how it ends.

217
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,680
Next episode:
“The Real Folk Blues Part 1”.
