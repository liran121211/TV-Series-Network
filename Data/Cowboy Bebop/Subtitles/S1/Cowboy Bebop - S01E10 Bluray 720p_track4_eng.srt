1
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,680
Shut up!

2
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,990
Ow…

3
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,050
W-Wha?

4
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,430
Hey, Jet.

5
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,250
I’m asking ya, how much
longer before we land?

6
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,760
How long ya been standing there?

7
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,630
I’ve been here for a while.

8
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,600
I see…

9
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,770
What’re ya spacing out about?

10
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,800
Where’s my bounty?

11
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,610
Can’t you land quickly so I can
hand over that musty-looking fugitive?

12
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,620
What, you haven’t even
gotten permission to land yet?

13
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,380
I know. You guys are so obnoxious.

14
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,320
Don’t rush so much!

15
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,290
And take care of the
airport end for me.

16
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,830
I thought Ganymede was your homeland.

17
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,770
Were you perhaps thinking about some
woman in the past that cried over you?

18
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,970
…or perhaps a woman
that made you cry.

19
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,340
Didn’t ya hear me when I said
you’re being obnoxious?!

20
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,510
<i>Yes…</i>

21
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,140
<i>This is Ganymede police.</i>

22
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,680
Donelly?

23
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,620
<i>Oh, Jet! Jet, it’s you!</i>

24
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,560
<i>There is no mistake…</i>

25
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,430
<i>The top of your head’s gotten rather</i>
<i>lonely, but it’s still Jet all right!</i>

26
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,020
Long time no see, Donelly.

27
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,400
<i>I’m surprised that you’re working</i>
<i>around here. Has it been…</i>

28
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,500
<i>Seven years? Eight?</i>

29
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,060
<i>What the hell’s up with you</i>
<i>to come back so suddenly?</i>

30
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,700
I wanna hand over a bounty.

31
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,910
Wanted ad number EX41285.
Baker Panchorero.

32
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,350
<i>To think you’re a bounty hunter…</i>

33
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,910
<i>You, who was called the Black Dog…</i>

34
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,550
<i>…a mad dog that never let</i>
<i>go of things bitten into?</i>

35
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,960
I thought you had already retired.

36
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,230
<i>Hey, I’m still an active officer!</i>

37
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,230
<i>Don’t judge things on your time</i>
<i>scale, you Rip Van Winkle you.</i>

38
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,260
—He used to be a cop? That explains…
<i>—That example is completely reversed!</i>

39
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,940
—What?
<i>—I’m just glad to see yer still kickin’.</i>

40
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,710
—…why I don’t get along with him.
<i>—Yeah, you, too.</i>

41
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,240
<i>Oh yeah… what was her name…</i>

42
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,210
<i>You know…</i>

43
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,240
<i>I know! Alisa!</i>

44
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,830
GANYMEDE ELEGY

45
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,820
She’s got a little joint
in the port of Marvis.

46
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,430
A small bar called “La Fin”…

47
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,870
But in this recession, I hear
she’s got a lot of debts to pay…

48
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,240
I’m sure there are a lot of problems
for a woman trying to live alone…

49
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,630
Sense of justice and duty, huh?

50
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,760
First time in a while he’s home,
of course he’s gonna go visit.

51
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,290
You’re totally wrong if you think
your old woman still thinks about you.

52
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,200
You’re totally wrong yourself if you
think every other woman thinks like you.

53
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,770
Justice and duty, duty,
three o’clock tea!

54
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,740
Really, men…

55
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,690
…are hopeless romantics.

56
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,120
Hey, why are you
rubbing that stuff on?

57
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,100
Beautiful skin is maintained by
continued effort that seems futile.

58
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,570
Do you understand?

59
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,800
I know! Futile! Useless!

60
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,790
This is…

61
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,130
…La Fin, right?

62
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,620
Yeah… and you are?

63
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,000
An old friend.

64
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,030
I was in the area for
the first time in a while…

65
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,270
Alisa… isn’t here.

66
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,270
Jet?

67
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,810
That can’t be…

68
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,720
Are you really Jet?

69
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,710
Rhint…

70
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,850
…he is my guest.

71
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,220
It’s all right.

72
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,230
You don’t mind?

73
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,000
I don’t…

74
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,730
Anyway…

75
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,330
How about it? You want a glass, right?

76
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,710
You’re my last customer.

77
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,880
I’m closing shop.

78
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,140
The number of ships decreased,
and this area has gotten desolate…

79
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,820
I’m thinking of moving to a new town.

80
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,850
Are you all right?

81
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,890
On the new island cities,
mortgage is expensive.

82
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,660
Are you able to manage all that?

83
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,300
That’s so like you to
worry about such things.

84
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,340
I’m planning to change
myself in the new town.

85
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,640
Don’t worry…

86
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,650
Rhint is here with me…

87
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,110
That guy that was just here?

88
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,680
Something on your mind?

89
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,810
Yeah.

90
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,320
To tell the truth,
I already have 3 kids…

91
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,360
I’m just kidding. It was a joke!

92
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,190
Rhint is just my boyfriend.

93
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,360
How are you doing?

94
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,660
Have you gotten married yet?

95
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,530
I live and wander with
a group of weirdos.

96
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,940
And on top of it,
I’m a bounty hunter now.

97
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,450
Do you remember?

98
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,830
<i>Where’s Jet?</i>

99
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,830
Doing personal stuff.

100
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,960
<i>You’re his partner, right?</i>

101
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,060
Yeah.

102
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,090
<i>I’ve got news on a bounty,</i>

103
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,830
<i>This hasn’t been</i>
<i>publicly broadcast yet…</i>

104
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,440
<i>Rhint Celonius.</i>

105
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,280
<i>A thug in the port of Marvis.</i>

106
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,510
<i>Last night, he contacted</i>
<i>financial broker Law Rentzuo.</i>

107
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,650
<i>This guy was another tough guy…</i>

108
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,380
<i>…but he was killed!</i>

109
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,020
And so?

110
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,430
<i>Rhint… is Alisa’s gigolo.</i>

111
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,860
<i>I thought I’d warn you guys.</i>

112
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,260
And how much is the bounty?

113
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,870
Back then…
when I got home from work…

114
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,280
You always waited for me.

115
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,840
That was all I needed.

116
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,120
But that day…

117
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,560
When I came home,
only that watch was left…

118
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,430
…and a small note with
one word: “farewell”.

119
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,800
For some reason, I didn’t feel sad.

120
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,140
It just lacked reality.

121
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:22,910
And I gradually felt something
inside me go numb…

122
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,150
After 6 months,
I made a bet with myself.

123
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,350
That I would leave this
planet if you didn’t return…

124
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,660
…by the time this clock stopped.

125
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,840
I didn’t come here to blame you.

126
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,000
I just wanted to know…

127
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,330
…why you disappeared back then.

128
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:58,450
You seem to think that
time on Ganymede had stopped.

129
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,620
That’s a story from long ago…

130
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,130
I’ve… forgotten it.

131
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,800
I don’t need time that stands still.

132
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,900
Farewell, Jet…

133
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,100
A bounty hunter? Then can he be?

134
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,940
Rhint…

135
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,000
He’s after me…

136
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,480
I have a bounty on my head…

137
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,940
It’s all over!

138
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,620
It’s not your fault.

139
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,860
It’s because I borrowed
money from a guy like him…

140
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,030
…and you protected me…

141
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,590
I can’t be saved if I get caught.

142
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,190
I…

143
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,430
…killed a guy…

144
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,440
Let’s get outta here…

145
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,410
Let’s get outta here,
just the two of us!

146
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,040
This must be because
I have good karma…

147
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,980
Sorry, but it’s business.

148
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,500
Steer for me, please!

149
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,030
<i>Hey? What’s wrong?!</i>

150
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,240
I’m after a bounty worth 1.8 million.

151
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,710
—<i>What?!</i>
<i>—Here, I’ll send it to you.</i>

152
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,040
He’s a bounty?

153
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:54,110
<i>Yeah, a secret bit of info from Donelly,</i>
<i>He apparently killed a loan shark.</i>

154
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,620
Dammit!

155
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,130
<i>I’ll do this. You can go back.</i>

156
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,130
You’re not gonna let him go, are ya?

157
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,570
<i>This is the land where I was a cop…</i>

158
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,040
I’m the Black Dog…
Once I bite, I never let go.

159
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,740
I have no regrets about her, but I’ll
settle this score on my home turf.

160
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,780
Sense of justice and duty, huh…

161
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,390
<i>Can you hear me…?</i>

162
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,320
<i>Stop the boat, now!</i>

163
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,320
Jet?

164
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,880
Stay away!

165
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,090
Please, let us go!

166
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,290
There are other bounties to find!

167
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:04,070
Even if I let you go,
someone will come for you someday…

168
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,110
If you run, you will
become an accomplice.

169
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,170
Stay away!

170
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,650
You still have time.

171
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,620
Don’t worry about me anymore!

172
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,100
You were like this back then, too…

173
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,130
You decided everything.

174
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,140
And you were always right…

175
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,770
When I was with you,
I never had to do anything.

176
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:45,840
All I had to do was hang on to your arm
like a child, with no cares in the world.

177
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,080
I wanted to decide how to
live my life by myself…

178
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,830
Even if that was a mistake…

179
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,450
Let go! I don’t wanna
go to prison! Let go!!

180
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,450
Help! Help me, please!

181
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,560
Be strong…

182
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,590
…and protect her…

183
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,640
Self-defense seems to
be how they see it.

184
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,250
What are you going to do now?

185
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,190
I won’t be going anywhere anymore.

186
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,860
I will wait in my store… for Rhint.

187
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,760
It won’t take long…

188
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,400
…because time is flowing along.

189
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:52,120
Aishiteta to nageku niwa…
Too much time has passed by…

190
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,460
…amarinimo toki wa sugite shimatta
…to lament that we were deeply in love.

191
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,160
Mada kokoro no hokorobi wo…
The wind keeps blowing, while my heart…

192
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,900
…iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru
…cannot heal all the tears in it.

193
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:20,150
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure
Someone, cry for me with parched eyes.

194
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,160
The real folk blues.

195
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:33,570
Honto no kanashimi ga shiritai dake
I only want to know what true sadness is.

196
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:41,200
Doro no kawa ni tsukatta…
Sitting in muddy water…

197
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,700
…jinsei mo waruku wa nai…
…isn’t such a bad life…

198
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:54,620
…ichido kiri de owaru nara…
…if it ends after the first time…

199
