1
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,340
It was raining that day as well…

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,320
You didn’t come because of the rain?

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,020
I was supposed to kill you…

4
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,450
That day…

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,050
…if I had killed you…

6
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,030
…I would have been free.

7
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,860
So why didn’t you?

8
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,230
Why did you choose to be pursued?

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,940
Why…

10
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,940
…did you…

11
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,740
…love me?

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,690
Let’s just run away somewhere.

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,720
Truly escape from this world…

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,130
…and go where no one else is…

15
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,100
Just the two of us…

16
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,640
THE REAL FOLK BLUES
(Part II)

17
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,960
What about him?

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,790
He got away.

19
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,370
All our men were defeated,
we ran out of weapons…

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,300
…and lost all means to…

21
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,570
Why did you come back?

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,610
Where is Julia?

23
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,080
I don’t know…

24
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,410
Shin.

25
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,250
Don’t follow in Lin’s footsteps.

26
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,260
Keep going, and pass the place.

27
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,370
What?

28
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,140
Someone might have gotten here already.

29
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,600
Wait here.

30
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,020
Annie?

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,830
I told them that you weren’t here.

32
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,600
That you were already dead.

33
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,960
I told them…

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,200
Don’t talk.

35
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,540
Vicious…

36
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,010
…killed off the elders, they said.

37
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,410
Everyone has lost sense
of where they want to be…

38
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,010
Just like kites with no strings.

39
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,190
I see… you were able to meet Julia…

40
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,490
I’m glad…

41
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,760
Annie!

42
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:35,000
It’s… rather chilly… today…

43
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,060
You don’t need weapons like
that just to run away.

44
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,270
You’re going to go.

45
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,210
I’ll go with you.

46
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,910
Until the very end, I’ll be with you.

47
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,650
I’m sorry.

48
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,720
I’m gonna make a bit of a scene.

49
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,680
You sure are a lucky woman.

50
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,980
Really.

51
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,080
I came back just at the right time,
and got involved in just the right way.

52
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,710
I really am lucky.

53
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,090
The Red-Tail won’t be
mobile for a while.

54
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,130
You’re doing pretty well yourself…

55
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,760
Getting the short end
of the stick and all.

56
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,990
He’s probably not coming back,
you know that?

57
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,200
He might have been
offed somewhere already.

58
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,830
Maybe so.

59
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,770
But, so what?

60
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,370
Do you want me to go looking for him?

61
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,600
You’ve got to be kidding!

62
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,010
He went off to do away with his past!

63
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,280
You made him go.

64
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,980
My leg was shot, my ship is busted!

65
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,210
Hell, yeah! He was nothing but trouble!

66
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,650
Like I care!

67
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,490
So what kind of a woman was Julia?

68
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,460
A normal woman…

69
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,000
A beautiful, dangerous but normal
woman that you can’t leave alone…

70
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,540
I see.

71
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,910
Like a devilish angel…

72
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,410
…or maybe an angelic devil.

73
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,740
This way!

74
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,110
Get down!

75
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,970
Julia!

76
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,900
Hey!

77
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,140
Where is Spike now?

78
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,150
All organisms…

79
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,480
All beings with life…

80
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,520
…all have their own stars.

81
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,360
The moment a new life is born…

82
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,730
…a new star is born,
and becomes the guardian star.

83
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,470
This star we stand on is
someone’s guardian star as well.

84
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,370
That red star, that blue star…

85
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,650
When a life ends,
the star falls and disappears.

86
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,780
Please don’t say that.

87
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,210
“Running Rock.”

88
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,550
Don’t call me by such a name!

89
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,580
His star is about to fall.

90
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,820
This is stupid. I can’t believe it.

91
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,120
Do not fear death.

92
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,600
Death is always at your side.

93
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:07,400
When you show fear,
it will spring at you faster than light.

94
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,810
If you do not show fear,
it will only gently look over you…

95
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,990
Sir Vicious, I found this.

96
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,390
The woman’s passport is
inside it as well.

97
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,290
Surely she cannot escape
from this planet easily.

98
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,060
A beast that has lost a place to go…

99
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,760
He has nowhere to return to now.

100
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,440
He will come.

101
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,830
Spike, you…

102
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,720
Do you have anything to eat?

103
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,700
I’m starving.

104
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,740
The food you cook
tastes horrible, as usual.

105
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,640
For that, you sure are eating a lot.

106
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,110
Hunger is the best spice, they say.

107
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,820
Do you know a story
that goes like this?

108
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,820
There once was a tiger-striped cat.

109
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,350
This cat died a million deaths
and was reborn a million times…

110
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,330
…and was owned by various
people who he didn’t care for.

111
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,770
The cat wasn’t afraid to die…

112
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,940
One day, the cat was
a free cat, a stray cat.

113
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,750
He met a white female cat, and the two
cats spent their days happily together.

114
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,990
Years passed, and the
white cat died of old age.

115
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,760
The tiger-striped cat cried
a million times, and then died.

116
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,700
It never came back to life…

117
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,210
That’s a good story…

118
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,710
I hate that story.

119
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,940
I hate cats.

120
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,770
That’s what I thought.

121
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,820
Spike.

122
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,720
Can I ask you one thing?

123
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,790
What?

124
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,260
Is it for the woman?

125
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,970
There is nothing I can
do for a dead woman.

126
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,010
Where are you going?

127
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,720
Why are you going?

128
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,190
You told me once…
that the past didn’t matter…

129
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,830
You’re the one who’s
tied to their past!

130
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,300
Look at these eyes.

131
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,480
One of them is a fake,
because I lost it in an accident.

132
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:46,190
Since then, I have been seeing the past
in one eye and the present in the other.

133
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,420
I had believed that what I saw
was not all of reality.

134
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,290
Don’t tell me things like that…

135
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,160
You never told me
anything about yourself!

136
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,030
Don’t tell me stuff like that now!

137
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,560
I thought I was watching a dream
that I would never awaken from.

138
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,480
Before I knew it,
the dream was all over.

139
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,320
My… memory came back.

140
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,390
But… nothing good came out of it.

141
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,620
There was no place
for me to return to…

142
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,730
This was the only place
I could go back to!

143
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,190
But now…

144
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,800
Where are you going?!

145
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,900
Why do you have to go?!

146
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,940
Are you telling me you’re going
to just throw your life away?!

147
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,870
I’m not going there to die.

148
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,750
I’m going there to see
if I really am alive.

149
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,050
Shin!

150
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,780
Where’s Vicious?

151
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,350
On the top floor. This way.

152
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,370
Shin!

153
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,970
Shin!

154
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,450
Please defeat… Vicious…

155
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,350
Actually…

156
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,480
…I wanted you to come back…

157
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,720
So, you are finally awake.

158
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,690
I told you before, Spike…

159
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,090
…that I am the only one
who can kill you.

160
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,200
I’ll return those words
back to you, Vicious.

161
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,170
Either way, we were destined
to end up like this.

162
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,600
Julia passed away.

163
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,370
Let’s end it all.

164
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,810
If that’s your wish.

165
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,260
This is…

166
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,760
…a dream…

167
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,930
Yeah…

168
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,400
Just a bad dream…

169
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,940
Bang…
