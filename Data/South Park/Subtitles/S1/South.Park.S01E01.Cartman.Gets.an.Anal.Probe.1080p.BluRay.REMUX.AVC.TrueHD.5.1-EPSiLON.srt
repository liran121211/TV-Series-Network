1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:03,587
<i>And now a fireside chat</i>

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,464
<i>with the creators of
Comedy Central's "South Park,"</i>

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,883
<i>Matt Stone and Trey Parker.</i>

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,724
- Hi, I'm Trey Parker.
- And I'm Matt Stone.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,018
And this here's ole Scratch.
Say hi, ole fellow.

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,645
We do a show called "South Park."

7
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,941
<i>Matt and Trey, tell us
a little bit about yourselves.</i>

8
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,860
Well, I-I met Matthew
at the University of Colorado

9
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,654
where I was going to film school.

10
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,615
I actually met him
in Beginning Filmmaking class.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,243
I met him and found someone
who could make me laugh,

12
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,119
even when I felt like crying.

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,832
<i>Guys, who would you say
are your role models?</i>

14
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,335
Well, I'd have to say
my biggest role model

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,628
is Matt.

16
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,129
I guess I'd have to say mine

17
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,382
is Theodore Roosevelt, for his work

18
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,634
with the Rough Riders
in the Spanish American War.

19
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,928
<i>Matt and Trey,
tell us about this episode.</i>

20
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,097
This episode is called
"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe,"

21
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,099
and it's our favorite episode.

22
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,018
In it, Kyle's baby brother Ike
gets abducted by aliens,

23
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,063
and Cartman has strange things
implanted in his ass.

24
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,898
I think that the reason
this episode is--

25
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,858
well, ole Scratch's favorite, anyway,

26
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,485
is because it's the only episode that

27
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,280
Matt and I animated
completely by ourselves.

28
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,532
You see, this was the pilot episode,

29
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,450
done before we had a series.

30
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,786
So Matt and I had to do
the whole thing by ourselves.

31
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,788
For several months,
we were locked into

32
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,541
a cold, dark, little room

33
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,043
for long periods of time.

34
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,130
<i>You know, that "Kick the Baby"
game looks like fun.</i>

35
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,798
<i>Have you guys ever
played it personally?</i>

36
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,217
Well, neither Trey
or I have children.

37
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,885
That's right,
the only family we have

38
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,221
is each other and ole Scratch here.

39
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,891
- We're not married yet.
- We can't even get dates.

40
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,102
But the truth is,
until we have children,

41
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,479
we're not gonna know whether
or not we're gonna kick them.

42
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,649
<i>You guys seem to write
alien encounter material</i>

43
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,027
<i>with a certain, uh, knowledge.</i>

44
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>Have either of you actually
ever been abducted?</i>

45
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,659
Trey, it's okay.

46
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,995
Go ahead and tell.

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,913
I grew up very near to South Park,

48
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,541
and so I was abducted
when I was a small child.

49
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,168
I remember the experience.

50
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,378
I remember how horrible it was.

51
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,672
I remember too much.

52
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,801
So sit back, relax, and enjoy

53

Ike, you can't come
to school with me.

70
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,017
Yeah, go home,

71
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,602
you little dildo.

72
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,104
Dude, don't call my brother a dildo.

73
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,314
- What's a dildo?
- I don't know.

74
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,941
And I'll bet Cartman
doesn't know either.

75
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,359
I know what it means.

76
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,985
Well, what?

77
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,821
I'm not telling you.

78
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:16,988
What's a dildo, Kenny?

79
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,912
Yeah, that's what Kyle's
little brother is, all right.

80
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,414
Ow.

81
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,416
Dude, that kicks ass.

82
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,834
Yeah, check this one out.

83
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,544
Ready, Ike? Kick the baby.

84
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,962
Don't kick the baby.

85
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,171
Kick the baby.

86
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,297
Aah!

87
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,385
Whoa, Cartman,

88
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,303
looks like you didn't get
much sleep last night.

89
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,347
That's because I was having
these bogus nightmares.

90
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,057
Really? What about?

91
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,101
Well, I dreamt that
I was lying in my bed,

92
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,477
<i>in the dark.</i>

93
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,229
<i>When all of a sudden</i>

94
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,148
<i>this bright blue light
filled the room.</i>

95
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,110
<i>And slowly my bedroom door
began to open.</i>

96
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,862
<i>And then the next thing I remember,</i>

97
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,488
<i>I was being drug through a hallway.</i>

98
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,783
<i>Then I was lying on a table,</i>

99
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,411
<i>and these scary aliens
wanted to operate on me.</i>

100
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,955
And they had big heads
and big black eyes.

101
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,874
- Dude, visitors.
- Totally.

102
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,917
- What?
- That wasn't a dream, Cartman.

103
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,586
Those were visitors.

104
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,004
No, it was just a dream.
My mom said so.

105
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,672
- Visitors are real.
- Yeah.

106
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,257
They abduct people
and they mutilate cows.

107
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,800
Oh, shut up, you guys,

108
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,885
you're just trying
to make me scared.

109
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,429
And it's not working.

110
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,930
Hello there, children.

111
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,474
Hey, Chef.

112
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,975
What's gonna be
for lunch today, Chef?

113
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,518
Well, today it's Salisbury steak

114
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,228
with buttered noodles and a choice

115
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,230
of green bean casserole
or vegetable medley.

116
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,648
Kick ass.

117
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,192
Say, did any of you children

118
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,610
see the alien spaceship last night?

119
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,153
- Huh?
- Yeah, fat boy saw it.

120
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,739
No, that... that was just a dream.

121
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,741
And I'm not fat. I'm big boned.

122
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,743
Oh, was it the ones
with the big long heads

123
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,286
and the black eyes?

124
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,871
- Oh!
- They took him on their ship.

125
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,373
Oh, did they give you an anal probe?

126
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,250
- Oh!
- What's an anal probe?

127
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,002
That's when they put this
big metal hoop-a-joop

128
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,754
up your butt.

129
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,506
Whoa, they gave you
an anal probe, Cartman?

130
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,592
No, I mean...
why would they do that?

131
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,052
Dude, they did, huh?

132
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,345
Aliens stuck stuff up your ass.

133
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,222
- No.
- An probe.

134
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,723
Shut up, dildo.

135
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,266
Well, I got to get to the cafeteria.

136
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,851
You children watch that fat boy, now.

137
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,853
He could be under alien control.

138
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,442
We told you they were real, Cartman.

139
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,236
Sorry to hear about your ass.

140
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,279
God damn it, they didn't do
anything to my ass.

141
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,156
It was just a dream.

142
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,536
Why you walking so funny, Cartman?

143
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,037
Shut up.

144
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,539
No, Ike, go home.

145
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,874
This is it, this one's for the game.

146
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,876
Kick the baby.

147
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,923
Good morning, Miss Crabtree.

148
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,175
Sit down, we're running late!

149
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,681
Damn it, he's still there.

150
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,307
Oh, don't worry about him.

151
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,934
No, dude,
if something happens to him,

152
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,394
my parents are gonna blame me.

153
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,688
Sit down back there! Aah!

154
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,815
Yeah, whatever, you fat bitch.

155
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,108
What did you say?

156
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,651
I said I have a bad itch.

157
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,819
Oh.

158
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,738
Oh, my God!

159
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:04,739
Visitors.

160
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,452
Ike! Stop the bus!

161
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,830
Miss Crabtree,
you have to stop this bus.

162
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,291
Do you want an office referral?

163
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,959
- No.
- Then sit down!

164
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:16,960
But I...

165
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,465
Aah!

166
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,636
Cartman, are those
the same visitors you saw?

167
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,513
Shut up, you guys, it's not working.

168
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,973
We have to do something.

169
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,266
Well, we can't do anything for now.

170
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,601
That fat bitch won't let us.

171
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,436
What did you say?

172
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,563
I said that rabbits eat lettuce.

173
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,649
Oh. Well, yes, they certainly do.

174
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,028
What am I gonna do?

175
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,946
My little brother's been
abducted by aliens.

176
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,364
You farted.

177
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,327

00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,712
At this rate,
all my cattle are gonna die

181
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,255
before the winter's through.

182
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,383
This is nothing out of the unusual.

183
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,095
Cows turn themselves
inside out all the time.

184
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,474
People been saying they've
been seeing UFOs around.

UFOs?

186
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,687
Yeah, and black army
CIA helicopters and trucks.

187
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,024
That's the silliest thing
I've ever heard.

188

00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,573
What am I supposed to do, Barbrady?

191
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,034
Just stand here and watch my cattle

192
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,869
get mutilated one by one?

193
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,459
Hey, my cattle!

194
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,381
You see?

195
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,132
There is something funny going on.

196
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,968

And now, children,

199
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,017
our friend Mr. Hat
is going to tell us

200
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,811
about Christopher Columbus.

201
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,729
That's right, Mr. Garrison,

202
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,607
Christopher Columbus
discovered America,

203
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,943
and was the Indians' best friend.

204
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,445
He helped the Indians
win their war against

205
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,989
Frederick Douglas,

206
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,866
and freed the Hebrews from Napoleon.

207
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,326
And discovered France.

208
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,995
Oh, man. I can't just sit here.

209
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,538
I have to help my stupid brother.

210
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,956
I'll come home without him

211
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,332
and my dad will start yelling,

212
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,292
"Where's your brother, Kyle?

213
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,128
You weren't looking out
for your little brother, Kyle."

214
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,838
Okay, okay, let's ditch school
and go find him.

215
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,006
"You know he can't think
on his own, Kyle.

216
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,507
"Brush and floss, Kyle.

217
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,925
Where has that finger been, Kyle?"

218
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,135

another prostate tumor?

223
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,768
No, my little brother's
been abducted by aliens.

224
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,813
It's true. Ask Cartman.

225
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,732
They gave him an anal probe.

226
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,109
That's a little joke.

227
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,695
Mr. Garrison, seriously,
I have to go.

Mr. Hat, may I please
be excused from class?

00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,462
is linked up to the visitors.

359
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,005
Oh, son of a bitch.

360
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,219
You guys shut up.

361
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,180
I'm not under alien control.

362
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,098
Hey, if you visitors can hear me...

363
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,516
- Hey.
- Bring me back

364
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,893
my little brother, God damn it!

365
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,520
Ow, that hurts, you butt licker!

366
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,897
Kyle, look, it's them.

367
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,232
Give me back my brother!

368
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,073
Oh, my God, they killed Kenny!

369
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,532
You bastards!

370
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,117
Come back here!

371
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,702
Come back!

372
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,954
Damn it! We were so close.

373
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,082
Hey, look, I think Kenny's okay.

374
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,877
Oh.

375
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,261
Wow, poor Kenny.

376
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,304
Now do you believe us, Cartman?

377
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,680
No.

378
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,807
Cartman, they killed Kenny.

379
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,100
He's not dead.

380
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,185
Dude, Kenny is dead.

381
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,812
See?

382
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,021
Shut up, you guys.

383
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,856
He's dead, Cartman.

384
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,818
God damn it,
I didn't have an anal probe!

385
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,820
Screw you guys. I'm going home.

386
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,114
Go on and go home,
you fat chicken.

387
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,240
Dildo!

388
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,159
You're all I have left, Stan.

389
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,869
Sorry, dude, I gotta go
meet Wendy Testaburger.

390
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,372
You can't.
Poor Ike must be so scared.

391
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,581
Up there all alone.

392
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,791
You gotta help me dude.

393
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,209
Dude, like Chef says,

394
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,335
I gotta get a piece of loving

395
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,962
while the getting's hot.

396
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,797
Rats.

397
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,967
Hello, Eric.

398
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,176
Hi, Mom.

399
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,428
How are you doing?

400
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,388
Well, I'm pissed off.

401
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:34,267
Here, I made you powdered
donut pancake surprise.

402
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,060
I don't want powdered
donut pancake surprise.

403
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,937
All the kids in school call me fat.

404
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,148
You're not fat, you're big boned.

405
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,816
That's what I said.

406
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,110
You can have an eensy-weensy bit,
can't you?

407
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,445
No.

408
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,196
Just a weensy-eensy woo-woo?

409
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,073
No, leave me alone, Mom.

410
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,701
How about a nice chocolate
chicken pot pie then?

411
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,996
But... well, that sounds pretty good.

412
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,372
Uh, Mom?

413
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,832
Yes, hon?

414
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,333
If anybody calls or comes over,

415
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,252
I'm not here, okay?

416
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,670
Sure, hon.

417
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,422
You want some Cheesy Poofs too?

418
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,007
Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.

419
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,137
Well, looks like she's not
gonna show up, Stan.

420
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,638
Let's go look for the visitors now.

421
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,973
But her note said she'd be here.

422
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,600
Hi, Stan.

423
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,018
Ew.

424
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,102
You can't talk to Stan, Wendy.

425
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,103
He throws up when you do.

426
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,605
But why, Stan?

427
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,398
Ew.

428
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,900
Look, could you guys
just get down to business

429
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:24,901
so we can find my little brother?

430
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,444
Huh?

431
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,029
Just make sweet love
down by the fire.

432
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,822
What happened to your little brother?

433
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,824
<i>As the reports of
UFO sightings increase,</i>

434
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,076
<i>more mysterious crop circle
patterns are appearing</i>

435
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,037
<i>in fields all around South Park.</i>

436
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,039
<i>These crop circles,
when viewed from above,</i>

437
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,583
<i>form strange patterns.</i>

438
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,961
Hey, that kind of looks like...
Tom Selleck.

439
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,671
<i>Could it be that aliens are trying to</i>

440
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,798
<i>make contact with us,
here on Earth?</i>

441
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,472
No, kitty, this is my pot pie.

442
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,724
No, kitty, that's a bad kitty!

443
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,227
No, kitty, this is my pot pie!

444
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,897
Mom, kitty's being a dildo.

445
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,983
Well, then I know
a certain kitty kitty

446
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,569
who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.

447
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,780
What?

448
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,406
And now I have
to go home without him,

449
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,367
and my parents
are gonna have me killed.

450
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,494
Well, why didn't you go
get the fat kid?

451
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,538
- Why?
- Well...

452
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,457
if the fat kid has something
implanted in his ass,

453
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,959
maybe the visitors are using him

454
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,460
as part of their plan.

455
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,295
You should use the fat kid as bait

456
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,630
to bring them back.

457
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,298
Hey, you're right, Wendy.

458
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,717
Come on, Stan,
we have to go get Cartman.

459
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,718
Come on, Stan.

460
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,303
Ew.

461
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,596
Hey, wait.

462
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,723
When do I get to make sweet love?

463
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,981
No, kitty, you can't have any.

464
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,359
No, kitty, this is my pot pie!

465
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,819
Bad kitty!

466
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,445
Oh. Excuse me, kitty.

467
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,782
Eric, look who's here.

468
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,576
Dude, weak, Mom.

469
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,910
Come on, Eric, we're gonna go play
at the bus stop.

470
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,495
I can't. My mom says--

471
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,913
That's okay, Eric.

472
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,290
I think you need to spend time

473
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,000
with your little friends.

474
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,626
But Mom, I don't want
to spend time with my...

475
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,295
Don't be difficult, Eric.

476
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,214
Now, you go out and play
in the fun snow.

477
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,424
God damn it.

478
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,137
You guys, I have to get home.

479
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,847
Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman.

480
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,390
This rope will make sure

481
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,809
they can't take you on board again.

482
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,561
Oh, man, this sucks.

483
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,229
How come the visitors
aren't coming for him?

484
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,647
I think we have
to signal them somehow.

485
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,774
Ow!

486
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,068
Hey, he's like Rudolph.

487
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,404
Yeah, all you have to do
is fart some more, Cartman,

488
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,364
and the visitors are sure to come.

489
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,033
Really?

490
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,535
Uh, I don't think I have
to fart anymore tonight.

491
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,703
Sure you do.

492
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,912
Come on, Cartman, fart.

493
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,456
I don't wanna.

494
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,874
He can't hold it in forever.

495
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,334
Fart, damn you!

496
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,294
Okay, that does it.

497
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,629
Now, listen,

498
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,213
why is it that everything today

499
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,049
has involved things either going in

500
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,509
or coming out of my ass?

501
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,844
I'm sick of it.

502
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,429
It's completely immature.

503
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,473
Hey, it's happening again.

504
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,769
Whoa, look at that.

505
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,103
Now do you believe us, Cartman?

506
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,772
You guys can't scare me.

507
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,440
I know you're making it all up.

508
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,984
Cartman,
there's an 80-foot satellite dish

509
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,736
sticking out of your ass.

510
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,113
Sure, you guys. Whatever.

511
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,492
Oh, boy,

512
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,869
the aliens are going
to make first contact.

513
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,996
Hey, down here!

514
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,166
We are ready for your wisdom!

515
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,126
And you only got 20 minutes

516
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,921
before "Sanford and Son" is on.

517
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,423
You guys, I am seriously

518
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,676
getting pissed off right now!

519
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,679
I know there's
no such thing as aliens!

520
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,141
Oh, God damn it!

521
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,060
What the--?

522
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,063
I tell you, there's crazy stuff
going on in this town.

523
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,108
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

524
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,944
Come down here, you stinking aliens.

525
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,571
Uh, uh...

526
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,073
Go on, Kyle,

527
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,282
ask them for your
little brother back.

528
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,826
V-visitors,

529
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,494
this morning you took
my brother, Ike.

530
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,995
He's the little freckled kid

531
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,580
that looks like a football.

532
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,374
At first I was happy
you took him away.

533
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,792
But I've learned something today.

534
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,335
That having a little brother

535
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,920
is a pretty special thing.

536
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,714
- Yeah.
- Aw, heck, Mr. Visitors,

537
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,674
I'm just a kid all alone
in this crazy world.

538
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,134
But if you can find it in your hearts

or whatever you have

540
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,220
to give my brother back to me,

541
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,389
it sure would make
my life brighter again.

542
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,099
That was beautiful, dude.

543
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,142
Did it work?

544
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,601
Nope, they're leaving.

545
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,520
Hey, you scrawny assed [bleep]!

546
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,355
What the [bleep] is wrong with you?

547
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,940
You must be some kind of [bleep]

548
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,650
to be able to ignore a crying child!

549
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,068
Whoa, dude.

550
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,153
You know what you [bleep] like?

551
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,405
You like to [bleep]...

552
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,660
Hey, Wendy, what's a [bleep]?

553
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,915
Ike, jump down, now!

554
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,918
For the love of God, Ike, jump!

555
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,503
Don't hurt me.

556
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,512
Moo.

557
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,396
Come on, Ike.

558
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,523
I promise I'll be nice
to you from now on.

559
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,941
Don't kick the baby.

560
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,741
What the hell are they talking about?

561
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,292
Ike!

562
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,635
Ike, do your impersonation
of David Caruso's career!

563
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,136
It's my turn.

564
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,151
You guys, get me down from here!

565
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,737
Help!

566
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,988
Help!

567
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,990
Sons a bitches!

568
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,701
Dildo!

569
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,037
Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.

570
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,206
Yeah, boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.

571
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,542
Fly in the sky.

572
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,085
Wait.

573
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,962
Where are you going, alien visitors?

574
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,588
Come back.

575
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,131
Well, Chef,
where's this amazing thing

577
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,301
Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies.

578
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,302
Come on in.

579
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,804
Come on, Ike,

00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,222
we can make it

The visitors dropped you off

609
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:30,910
just in time to go to school.

Oh, man,

611
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,996
I had this crazy
nightmare last night.

612
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,539
Really? What about?

613
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,917
Well, I was standing out in a field

614
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,377
and I had this huge satellite dish

615
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,129
sticking out of my butt.

616
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,465
And then there was
hundreds of cows and aliens

617
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,467
and then I went up on the ship

618
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,385
and Scott Baio gave me pink eye.

619
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,470
That wasn't a dream, Cartman.

620
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,596
That really happened.

621
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:51,931
Oh, right.

622
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,432
Why don't I have pink eye then?

623
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,267
Cartman, you do have pink eye.

624
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,645
Oh, son of a bitch.
