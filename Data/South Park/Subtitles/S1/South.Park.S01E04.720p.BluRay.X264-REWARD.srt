1
00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:02,837
[both laughing]

2
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:04,130
Oh, boy.

3
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:06,298
Beefcake.
I'll tell you.

4
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:08,134
That is a hoot and a holler.
[sighs]

5
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,677
This next episode is definitely

6
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,429
both Trey and I's
favorite episode.

7
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:13,889
It's called "Big Gay AI's
Big Gay Boat Ride."

8
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,349
In it, Stan finds out

9
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,476
that his dog Sparky
is a homosexual.

10
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:21,188
[Male Voice] How did your preoccupation
with homosexuality develop?

11
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,898
Well, we have noticed
that America

12
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,234
definitely has a preoccupation
with gayness,

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,861
but we felt there was
a part of homosexuality

14
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,571
that has been left unexplored,

15
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:32,199
and that's animal homosexuality.

16
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,702
[Male Voice] I know people are curious
about the two of you too.

17
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,704
Are you guys, uh...

18
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,539
a couple,
if you know what I mean?

19
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,708
You... you mean, are we gay?

20
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,209
Yeah.

21
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:45,087
Well, I am a little.

22
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,797
I guess we're all a little gay.

23
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,759
Even little Scratch here.
Yeah.

24
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,178
[Male Voice] You must have gotten a lot
of mail on this episode.

25
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,471
What kinds of stuff
do you get in the mail

26
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:55,347
from fans in general?

27
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:58,309
We have great fans
and great fan mail.

28
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,810
People write such interesting,

29
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,812
fascinating things to us
every week.

30
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,689
Let me give you an example.

31
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,108
"Dear Trey and Matt,

32
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,027
I like your show."

33
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,988
That's from Tom in New Jersey.

34
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,659
[Male Voice] Why does Kenny have to die
so often and so horribly?

35
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:16,744
Both: Because he's poor.

36
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,454
[softly] Aw.

37
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,206
[Male Voice] Guys, is there stuff
you put into the show

38
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:22,833
that's subliminal,
kind of like a little reward

39
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,044
for the fans who are
really paying attention?

40
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:28,130
Yes. We definitely feel
we owe it to our hardcore fans

41
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,841
to put hidden subliminal
messages in every episode.

42
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,718
That way, they can watch
the episode over and over

43
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,011
and find something new
every time.

44
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,054
For instance, in this episode,

45
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,847
if you look really hard,

46
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,517
you can find a picture of me
having sex with Matt's mom.

47
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:40,893
What?

48
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,354
So now sit back,
relax, and enjoy

49
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,773
"Big Gay AI's
Big Gay Boat Ride."

50
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,400
<i>[pleasant music]</i>

51
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,619

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,807
# So come on down
to South Park #

64
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,559
# And meet some
friends of mine #

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,936
Hey, where's the school bus?

66
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,646
We're gonna be late
for football practice.

67
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,398
Hiya, Sparky.
Who's that?

68
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,691
That's my new dog Sparky.

69
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,151
He followed me to the bus stop.

70
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,694
Wow, cool!
Good boy, Sparky.

71
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,154
Who's my best buddy?

72
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,780
Who's your boy?
Who's your buddy?

73
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,824
Ugh.
You're making me sick, dude.

74
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,784
He's part Doberman
and part wolf.

75
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,536
He's the toughest dog
on the mountain.

76
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,788
No way. Everybody knows
that Sylvester

77
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,624
is the toughest dog
in South Park.

78
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,126
[growling]

79
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,586
He's not meaner than Sparky!

80
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,171
Oh, yeah?
Let's see.

81
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,255
Hey, Sylvester!

82
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,756
Sparky'll kick his ass!

83
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,508
I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.

84
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,801
You're on, dude.

85
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,637
That's it, Sparky, kick his ass!

86
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:01,765
[dogs panting]

87
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:04,435
Huh. He's doing
<i>something</i> to his ass.

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,395
He's not kicking his ass,
but he's definitely

89
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,980
doing something to his ass.

90
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,690
Sparky, bad dog!

91
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,192
[mumbling]

92
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:12,276
What?
Yeah, dude.

93
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,360
I think your dog is gay.

94
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,653
What do you mean?

95
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,614
That dog is a gay homosexual.

96
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:17,865
[dogs panting]

97
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,533
He's just confused.

98
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,285
I think the other dog's
the one that's confused.

99
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,369
[mumbling]

100
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,746
Sick! Shut up, dude.

101
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,206
[whining]

102
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,957
# Stan's dog's a homo #

103
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,084
# Stan's dog's a homo #

104
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,129
<i>Okay, children,
I know that you're all</i>

105
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,381
extremely excited
and nervous and anxious

106
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,343
about the homecoming game
against Middle Park.

107
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:38,969
Who's Middle Park?
What's homecoming?

108
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,679
But just remember
what I taught you

109
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,598
that football
is like making love

110
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,309
to a really beautiful woman.

111
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,020
You can't always score,
but when you do,

112
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,648
it makes all the trying
worthwhile.

113
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,692
Now let's start practice.
[whistle blows]

114
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,027
Uh, Mr. Chef, sir?

115
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,612
Yes, Pip, what is it?

116
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,905
I still don't have a helmet.

117
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,114
I know, Pip.

118
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,115
The school can't afford helmets

119
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,367
for everybody.

120
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,952
Yes, but couldn't we rotate

121
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,370
who doesn't have a helmet
every week?

122
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:05,871
Does it always have to be me?

123
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,249
Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does.

124
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,708
Oh.
Sorry, son.

125
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,460
Now get your ass in there.

126
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,921
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.

127
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,881
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,

128
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,049
hut, hut, hut.

129
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,760
Hike the damn ball!

130
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,845
[grunts]
[screaming]

131
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:22,888
Hey, how's practice

132
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,014
coming there, Chef?

133
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,474
Huh? Oh, fine, fine.

134
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,892
I don't have to remind you

135
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,602
just how important this game is

136
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,354
to us South Park alumni.

137
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,897
Elementary school alumni?

138
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,565
That's as far as most of us got.

139
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,567
You think we have a shot
at beating the spread

140
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:37,152
against Middle Park this year?

141
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,363
I don't know.
What... what's the spread?

142
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,241
Middle park by 70 points.
Hmm.

143
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,368
Hey, I got it!
I got it, I got it!

144
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,829
I don't think we have a chance.

145
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,498
Nonsense, not with my nephew
a quarterback.

146
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,041
Right, Stanley?

147
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,251
Huh?

148
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,295
[grunts]

149
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,299
Attaboy!
Great pass, Stan!

150
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,633
Come on, Ned,
we got to get our asses

151
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,218
to the bookie!

152
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,803
[whistle blows]

153
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,431
Okay, that was
a good practice, children.

154
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,308
We'll see you here again
tomorrow.

155
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,143
Hey, Stan, isn't that your dog?

156
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,645
Yeah, he must have followed
me to football practice.

157
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,188
You see, he is smart.

158
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,773
Uh, my dog Rex follows me

159
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,026
to football practice
all the time.

160
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,986
Yeah, but my dog
found his own way here.

161
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,404
That makes him smarter
than your...

162
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,323
[dogs panting]
Sparky, get down!

163
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:24,283
Oh, my God,
what is he doing to my dog?

164
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,617
There he goes again.

165
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,202
Get down, Sparky, down!

166
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,871
Stan forgot to mention
that his dog

167
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,289
is a gay homosexual.

168
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,832
Make him stop!

169
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,917
[yelping]

170
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,712
[laughing] I'm sure glad
my dog isn't gay!

171
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,673
Yeah, maybe you should
name your dog Sparkette, Stan.

172
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,301
[laughing]
Gay dog.

173
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,013
And so you see, Simon and Simon

174
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,765
were not brothers in real life,

175
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,641
only on television.

176
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,353
Thank you
for that presentation, Eric,

177
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,563
but the assignment
was on Asian cultures.

178
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,773
You get a D-minus.

179
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,358
Aw, damn it!

180
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,318
Who should we call on
next, Mr. Hat?

181
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:02,696
How about Stan, our little
South Park quarterback star?

182
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,906
Oh, good idea.

183
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,491
Okay, Stanley, you're next.

184
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,201
Um, I'm not really prepared
either.

185
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,661
Well, just make something up
like Eric did.

186
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,121
Okay, um,

187
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,790
Asian culture has...

188
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,375
plagued our fragile Earth
for many years.

189
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,459
We must end it...

190
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,835
Excellent. A-minus!

191
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,920
Hey!
Wow, cool!

192
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:18,962
Wait a minute!

193
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:19,963
Why the hell does he get

194
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,131
an A-minus?

195
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,508
Eric, Stanley just might

196
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,801
lead our team to victory

197
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,177
against the Middle Park Cowboys

198
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,845
for the first time in decades.

199
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,555
And we treat star athletes
better

200
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,932
because they're better people.

201
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,016
That's not fair!

202
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,017
Life isn't fair, kiddo.

203
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,310
Get used to it.

204
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,145
Stupid puppet.

205
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,189
Don't forget your assignments
tonight, children.

206

They're due tomorrow
for everybody but Stan.

207
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,235
Mr. Garrison,
can I ask you a question?

208
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,945
Of course, Stanley.
What is it?

209
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,280
What's a homosexual?

210
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,740
Oh, well, Stanley,

211
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,659
I guess you came
to the right person.

212
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,119
Sit down.

213
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,580
Stanley, gay people...

214
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,542
well, gay people are evil.

215
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,752
Evil right down
to their cold, black hearts,

216
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,838
which pump not blood
like yours and mine,

217
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,714
but rather a thick vomitus oil

218
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,383
that oozes through
their rotten veins

219
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,260
and clots
in their pea-sized brains,

220
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,387
which becomes the cause
of their Nazi-esque patterns

221
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,013
of violent behavior.

222
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,641
Do you understand?
I guess.

223
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,893
Good, I'm glad we could have
this little talk, Stanley.

224
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,395
Now you go outside
and practice football

225
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,188
like a good little heterosexual.

226
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,482

227
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,526
You guys see me
block that defense today?

228
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,278
I was kicking ass.

229
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:25,737
You're gonna need to
kick more ass than that

230
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,156
to beat the Cowboys.

231
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,116
Hey, speaking of pounding ass,

232
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,826
here comes Stan's
little homo dog!

233
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,369
Shut up, dude!

234
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,329
Sparky, where'd you get
that pink scarf?

235
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,581
[barks]

236
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:36,582
Man, that is the gayest dog

237
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,833
I have ever seen.

238
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,834
He just needs some training,

239
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,835
that's all.

240
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,295
Sit, Sparky.

241
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,922
Good boy.
Now shake.

242
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,885
Good boy.
Now don't be gay!

243
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,220
Don't be gay, Spark.

244
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,221
Don't be gay.

245
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,639
[grunts]

246
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,057
Did it work?
I don't know.

247
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,976
He still looks pretty gay to me.

248
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,188
Hey, Stan, your dog been
to any pride marches lately?

249
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,482
[laughing] Yeah, maybe you
should take him

250
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,192
to a Barbra Streisand concert.

00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,862

Gay dog.

253
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,614
Come on, you guys.
I have an idea.

257
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,958
No, sirree, I'm telling you,

258
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,460
I got the line.

259
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,504
My nephew Stan is
the best quarterback

260
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,088
the school's ever seen.

261
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,883
I guarantee
they'll beat the spread.

262
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,052
I'm gonna put all my money
on the Cows.

263
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,387
I'll put $300 on the Cows
too, if they guarantee...

264
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,349
Hey, I want to put some money
on the cows too.

265
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,934
Whoa, whoa!

266
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,977
Don't get too carried away, now.

267
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,146
You better be right
about this, Jimbo.

268
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,648
[chuckles] Yeah.

269
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,441
Uh, don't...
Don't worry yourself.

270
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,693
Are you sure Stan is that good?

271
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,862
Well, not that sure.

272
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,989
I think we better come up
with a backup plan.

273
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,866
Uh, let's see here.

274
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,201
Hey, bookie, what...

275
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,577
What's the halftime show
gonna be?

276
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,246
You haven't heard?

277
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,665
John Stamos' older brother
Richard Stamos

278
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,291
is gonna sing "Loving You".

279
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,751
I love that song.

280
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,128
"Loving you"?
That's perfect.

281
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,964
Come on, Ned,
Middle Park's gonna get

282
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,341
a halftime show
they'll never forget.

283
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,928
Okay, Sparky,
we got you a present.

284
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,264
Now why don't... damn it, Sparky,

285
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,306
where do you keep
getting this thing?

286
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,307
No pink bandana, Sparky.

287
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,308
Bad dog!

288
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,643
Now pay attention.

289
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,062
Sparky, this is Fifi.

290
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,438
Ooh la la!

291
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,690
There he goes.

292
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,483
Attaboy, Spark, get her!

293
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,569
Yes!

294
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,657
Ah, crap.
Now what do I do?

295
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,825
Who cares if your dog is gay?

296
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,034
Maybe it's not that bad.

297
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,411
No way, dude, my mom says

298
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,121
God hates gay people.

299
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,165
That's why he smote
the sodomies in France.

302
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,795
that homosexuals
are evil, but...

303
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,380
but Sparky doesn't seem evil.

304
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,173
Well, maybe Mr. Garrison
is wrong.

305
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,174
You should ask somebody else.

306
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,759

00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,628
Chef?
# Spank it #

360
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,089
Chef!
Oh, uh, sorry, children.

361
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,632
Uh, let's run some plays.

362
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,259
Ah, Mr. Chef, sir?

363
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,053
No, Pip, we still don't
have a helmet for you.

364
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,347
Righto, but how about
I'll use a helmet today,

365
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,015
and one of the other
children goes without.

366
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,268
That wouldn't be very fair
to the other children,

367
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,352
now, would it?

368
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,770
Oh, I... I guess not.

369
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,398
What we want to do here, Carl,

370
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,525
is put a trigger on that bomb
that makes it go off

371
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,819
at a specific moment
during halftime.

372
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,487
And what moment would that be?

373
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,781
Well, John Stamos' older brother

374
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,200
is all set to sing "Loving you"
during halftime.

375
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,162
We want that bomb to go off
when he hits that high F.

376
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,329
What high F?

377
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,372
You know...

378
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,040
# Loving you #

379
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,877
# Is easy 'cause
you're beautiful #

380
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,004
# Doot'n-doot'n doo-doo #

381
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,006
# Ahh #

382
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,675
So you want the trigger
on the "doot'n doo"?

383
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,887
No, damn it, the "Ahh"!

384
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,430

00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,767
Great.

00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,560
# Ahh # # Doot'n doodoo #

388
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,645
You got it.
# Doot'ndoot'n doo-doo #

389
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,272
Both: # Ahh #

390
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,107
All right. Yeah, okay.

391
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,275
What's the matter, Stan?

392
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,526
You seem down.

393
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,944
I just... I can't concentrate

394
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,279
'cause my dog is gay.

395
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,781
Well, you know what they say.

396
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,575
You can't teach a gay dog
straight tricks.

397
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,076
Oh, stop filling his head

398
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,037
with that queer-loving
propaganda.

399
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,040
Say what? You of all people
should be sympathetic.

400
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,250
What do you mean?
Well, you're gay, aren't you?

401
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,795
What? What the hell
are you talking about?

402
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,171
I am not gay!

403
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,173
Well, you sure do act like it!

404
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,176
I just act that way
to get chicks, dumb-ass.

405
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:23,845
What's the matter, dude?

406
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,555
I don't know where Sparky is.

407
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,349
He usually follows me
to football practice.

408
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,518
Maybe he went shopping
for some leather pants.

409
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,602

He still hasn't come back.

Wow, it's been, like, two days.

426
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,142
I think he might have run away.

the shopping mall...

428
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:13,770
Ow!
We'll help you look for him

429
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,188
after the game, Stan.

430
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,857
I'm not playing.
You what?

431
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,149
I'm not playing
in that stupid game.

What are we doing here?

437
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,870
Well, Ned, we always

kidnap Middle Park's mascot.

439
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,708
But this year, we're gonna
booby-trap it instead,

Hello, everyone,
this is Frank Hammond,

452
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,025
South Park Public Radio, AM 900.

453
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,484
Welcome to tonight's matchup

454
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,986
between the Middle Park Cowboys

455
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,821
and the South Park Cows.

456
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,948
Well, it looks like Chef,
the South Park Cows' coach,

457
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:07,991
is a little nervous.

458
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,034
This is probably because

459
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,076
his star quarterback

460
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,161
has yet to show up.

461
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,622
Oh, come on, Stan.

462
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,624
Uh, Mr. Chef,
if Stanley doesn't show up,

463
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,625
can I use his helmet?

464
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,209
No, Pip, I'm sorry!

465
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,045
Sparky!

466
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,671
Sparky!

467
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,549
Play ball!

468
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,092
You're gonna have to
quarterback, Kyle.

469
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,594
But I never practiced
quarterback.

470
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,804
It's a little late
for that bullcrap now.

471
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,264
Filling in for quarterback

472
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,516
is number 12,
Kyle "Broslovski."

473
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,602
Hey, hey,
where's little Stanley?

474
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,604
Yeah, why the hell is
that little Jewish kid

475
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,022

476
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,149
Ned, look.

477
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,653
They've got Enrique
on their sidelines.

is still attached.

Fine, how are you?

00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,167
I'm super, thanks for asking.

484
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,627
My gay dog ran away
and I was wondering

485
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,045
if maybe he came here.

486
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,130
Well, let's see.
Come on in.

487
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,883
Do you have lots
of gay dogs here?

488
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,635

Wow, it seems like the
animals here are really happy.

Of course they are, silly buns!

498
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,486
It's the one place
where gay animals

499
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,779
can really be themselves.

00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:28,947

No, I didn't!
That was just my shoes.

Come on, Kyle,

514
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,639
we'll get a delay of game
penalty!

515
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,308
No way, dude!
Hike the ball!

516
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,685
Oh, dude, weak.

517
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,228
That's right,
you get back there.

518
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,813
Hike!
The ball is snapped.

Middle Park,

with 14:57 remaining
in the first quarter.

00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,097
[barks]
I missed you, old pal.

539
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,474
You really had me scared.

540
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,309
[barks]
Come on, let's go home.

541
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,061
I can still make it
in time for the game.

542
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,146
We can work on making you
not gay together.

543
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,647
##

544
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:45,774
Sparky?

545
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,067
Young man, it appears

546
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,693
you still don't understand.

547
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,694
What don't I understand?

548
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,945
Come this way.

549
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,655
I have to show you something.

550
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,532
With just over a minute to go
in the half,

551
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,868
the score is
Middle Park Cowboys 52,

552
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,870
South Park Cows, zero.

553
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,081
[all screaming]

554
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,208
Oh, my!
I haven't seen an Englishman

555
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,627
take a blow like that
since Hugh Grant!

556
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,504
Dude!
Now, that is not cool.

557
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,214
Sorry, sorry.

558
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,799
Okay, Stan, I think
you should get in line

559
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,717
for my big gay boat ride.

560
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,011
Step aboard, Stanley.

561
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,514
<i>[percussive music]</i>

562
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,057
Hello, everyone,
and welcome aboard

563
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,058
the big gay boat ride!

564
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,601
On this adventure,

565
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:22,727
we'll be seeing
the world of gayness

566
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,687
throughout time.

567
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,689
And the South Park Cows
are set to receive.

568
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,149
There's the kick.

569
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,944
It's taken by number 23,
Kenny McCormick.

570
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,738
He's at the 50,
the 40, the 30...

571
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,240
[all shouting]

572
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,492
The little running back is down!

573
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,244
I think he's...

574
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,454
yes, he's been decapitated!

575
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,414
[gasps] Oh, my God,

576
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,707
they killed Kenny!

577
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,626
You bastards!

578
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,211
That's got to hurt, Frank!

579
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,212
Ouch-eroo!

580
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,755
Hey, come on,

581
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,340
that was roughing!

582
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,634
At least let us
scrape him off the field!

583
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,302
Looks like the South Park Cows

584
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,429
aren't even gonna beat
the 72-point spread,

585
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,181
not by a long shot.

586
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,183
You see, gayness has existed

587
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,977
since the beginning of time,

588
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,812
from the Egyptian pharaohs,

589
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,064
to the shoguns of Japan.

590
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,151
Uh-oh, look out,
it's the oppressors!

591
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,736
Christians and Republicans
and Nazis, oh my!

592
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:14,988
[gunshot]

593
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,407
Oh! Oh, gosh, that was close.

594
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,534
Okay, let's steer
our big gay boat out of here

595
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,203
and into a place where gays
are allowed to live freely.

596
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,457
All: # We are gay
and it's okay #

597
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,835
# 'Cause gay means happy
and happy means gay #

598
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,420
# We're not sad anymore #

599
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:31,880
# 'Cause we're out
the closet door #

600
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,424
# It's okay to be gay #

601
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,800
So what do you think, Stan?

602
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,343
This kicks ass.

603
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,179
I'm sorry I tried
to change you, Spark.

604
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,930
I just didn't understand.

605
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,515
Isn't this precious?

606
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,267
And now here to sing
the touching song

607
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,436
"Loving You"
is the one and only,

608
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,938
John Stamos' brother!

609
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,315
All right, Richard!

610
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,358
<i>[piano music]</i>

611
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,028
# Loving you #

612
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:59,324
# Is easy
'cause you're beautiful #

613
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,035
# Doot'n-doot'n doo-doo #

614
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,120
[off-key]
# Ahh #

615
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,705
# Ahh #

616
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,873
What the hell?

617
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,333
He didn't sing the high F!

618
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,210
Richard Stamos
can't sing a high F.

619
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,170
He always screws it up
like this.

620
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,672
Ned, we are gonna
get our asses kicked!

621
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,174
# La, la, la, la, la #

622
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,634
It's obvious where
all the talent

623
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,636
in that family went!

624
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,973
Thanks for everything,
Big Gay Al.

625
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,308
[barks]
No problem, kids.

626
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,643
Are you sure
you don't want to stay

627
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,102
for some toasted
cheese sandwiches?

628
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,270
No thanks.
I've got to get back

629
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,355
for the big football game.

630
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,481
Come on, boy.

631
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:33,107
Oh, Stan...

632
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,859
when you get back to town,

633
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,028
tell them about us, will you?

634
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,030
Tell them there are
gay animals here

635
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,491
who need homes, desperately.

636
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:42,659
I will, Big Gay Al.

637
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:43,826
I will.

638
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,705
Oh, my carrot cake.

639
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,083
And these South Park Cows
are being absolutely

640
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,876
molested by Middle Park.

641
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,920
I haven't seen so many
children molested since...

642
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,505
I thought you said
beating the spread

643
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,257
was a sure thing, Jimbo!

644
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:00,343
Yeah, we all put our
life savings in this game!

645
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,136
You're a dead man, Jimbo!

646
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,930
Well, this should
just about wrap it up for...

647
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,099
Wait a minute, what's this?

648
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,767
Yeah! Yoo-hoo!

649
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,228
It's Stan, the South Park
star quarterback.

650
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,272
Where the hell
have you been, Stan?

651
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,940
I've been getting
my best friend back.

652
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,650
Just get in there, boy.

653
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,235
Give 'em hell, Stanley!

654
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,905
Jesus... now, I haven't
asked you for much.

655
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,907
But all we need is
one little score.

656
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,826
Please, please, Jesus.

657
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,244
Leave me alone.

658
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,662
Hike!
Stan hikes the ball.

659
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:28,997
He steps back to pass.

660
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,541
Hey, Stan, I'm open I think.

661
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,918
And he throws it to Kyle,
the little Jewish kid.

662
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,005
Oh, my!

663
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,464
I haven't seen a Jew
run like that

664
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,216
since Poland, 1938!

665
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,426
Dude!

666
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:43,803
Touchdown!

667
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,513
Yeah!
Whoo!

668
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,140
The clock runs out,
and the final score is

669
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,017
Middle Park Cowboys 73,

670
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,893
South Park Cows 6.

671
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,479
South Park beats the spread.

672
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,024
Yeah! Yoo-hoo!

673
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,525
Speech!

674
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,193
Stan, what do you want
to tell the world

675
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,571
about this stunning
almost victory?

676
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,614
Uh, it's really cool

677
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,408
that we beat the spread
against the Cowboys.

678
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,076
Yeah, all right!

679
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,996
And maybe we can beat 'em
even more next year.

680
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,205
Whoo!

681
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,416
And it's okay to be gay.

682
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:15,668
What?

683
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,503
Being gay is just part of nature

684
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,963
and a beautiful thing.

685
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,923
What the hell is
he talking about?

686
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,343
Uh, Stanley, you arrived
very late in the game.

687
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,011
Where were you that whole time?

688
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,138
I was with my new friend,
Big Gay Al.

689
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,057
He showed me
his big gay animal sanctuary

690
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,767
and took me
on a big gay boat ride,

691
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,186
where I learned all about
the wonders of gaiety.

692
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,689
It's true.
I'll show you.

693
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,444
But it was here.
It was all right here.

694
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,488
There... there was
a techno dance club.

695
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,490
Stan, you need to lay off
the cough syrup.

696
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:46,866
All right?
Seriously.

697
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,242
I'm worried about you, man.

698
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,660
Oliver!

699
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:50,912
I thought you ran away

700
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,622
all those months ago.

701
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:53,623
Sidney!

702
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:54,624
Willie!

703
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,042
Carlos!

704
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,377
I want to thank you so much

705
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,045
for bringing everybody here.

706
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,464
Oh, there you are, dude.
How's it going?

707
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,758
I'm super, thanks for asking.

708
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,010
It looks like now
my work here is done.

709
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,181
Good-bye, Stanley.
Peace be with you.

710
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,224
Wow!

711
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:14,102
[shimmering tone]

712
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,562
You guys, you guys!
I can do it.

713
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:17,563
Do what?

714
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,273
# Loving you #

715
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:22,110
# Is easy 'cause
you're beautiful #

716
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,111
