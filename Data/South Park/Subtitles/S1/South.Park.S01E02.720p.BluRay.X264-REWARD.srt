<i>And now a fireside chat with
the creators of Comedy</i>

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,843
<i>Central's "South Park," Matt
Stone and Trey Parker.</i>

3
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:14,765
<i>[light quirky music]</i>

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,892
Oh, hello.
I'm Trey Parker.

5
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:18,227
And I'm Matt Stone.

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,478
And this here is old Scratch.

7
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,480
Say hi, old fella.

8
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,483
This episode of "South Park" is
called "Weight Gain 4000,"

9
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,777
and it's by far our favorite
episode.

10
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,739
It's all about Kathie Lee
Gifford coming to "South Park"

11
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:34,035
and Eric Cartman trying to beef
himself up for the big day.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,328
Exactly how much weight does
Eric Cartman gain

13
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:37,955
in this episode?

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,623
Well, after Eric Cartman
starts eating

15
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:42,126
the Weight Gain 4000,
he gains 700 pounds.

16
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,336
That makes him almost as heavy
as Sally Struthers.

17
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:47,798
Has Kathie Lee Gifford ever
offended you in some fashion?

18
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,384
Was she flattered by her
depiction here?

19
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,886
Well, we don't really care,

20
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,012
because Kathie Lee Gifford is
a...

21
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:55,014
Very wonderful woman.

22
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:59,894
Both Trey and I really, really
respect her work with Regis.

23
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,395
Guns and bullets seem to be

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,980
a recurring theme in "South
Park."

25
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,983
Have either of you ever killed
anyone?

26
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:11,030
I would never kill somebody,
unless they pissed me off.

27
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,823
Guys, why do you keep killing
off poor Kenny?

28
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,700
What did he ever do to you?

29
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,912
Well, Kenny is definitely our
favorite character.

30
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,914
And even though he is our
favorite character,

31
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,707
we feel we have to kill him in
every episode,

32
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,542
and this one of our favorite
deaths in this one.

33
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,045
How does someone create a
show like "South Park"

34
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,588
and remain as pure and wholesome

35
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,423
as you both appear to be?

36
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,300
You know, everyone thinks
that in order to do

37
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,761
"South Park" we must be wild,
crazy rock 'n roll stars,

38
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,347
but the truth is, we're just
wholesome middle-American guys.

39
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:39,308
We enjoy soda pop, baseball,
and beating up old people

40
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,768
just as much as anybody.

41
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,149
So now sit back, relax, and
enjoy "Weight Gain 4000."

Yeah, it was huge.

Ugh, I hate those things.

60
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,404
Nobody hates rainbows.

61
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,614
Yeah, what's there to hate
about rainbows?

62
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,701
Well, you know, you'll just
be sitting there

63
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,704
minding your own business, and
they'll come marching in

64
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,831
and crawl up your leg and
start biting

65
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,166
the inside of your ass.

66
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,168
And you'll be all like, "Hey,

67
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:50,546
get out of my ass, you stupid
rainbows."

68
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:54,008
Cartman, what the hell are
you talking about?

69
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,926
I'm talking about rainbows.

70
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,720
I hate those friggin' things.

71
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,180
Rainbows are those arches of
color

72
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:00,556
that show up during a rainstorm.

73
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,059
Oh, rainbows.

74
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,227
Oh, yeah, I like those.

Those are cool.

00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,815
Heh? Oh, nothing. Forget it.

78
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,984
No, what marches in, crawls
up your leg...

79
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,235
Nothing.
And bites the inside

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,237

Nothing.

That's right, Mr. Hat.

90
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,675
The winner of the national
Save Our Fragile Planet

91
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,095
contest is... Eric Cartman.

92
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:41,639
What?
What?

93
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,307
Congratulations, Eric, on
writing

94
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,934
the award-winning paper.

95
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,352
Kick ass.

96
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,229
That's impossible.

97
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,189
Cartman doesn't know a rain
forest from a Pop-Tart.

98
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,524
Yeah, I do.
Pop-Tarts are frosted.

99
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,610
Out of over a million papers,

100
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,029
Eric's was chosen as the
grand prize winner.

101
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,114
Wow, what did you write
about, Cartman?

102
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,408
Oh, you know, this and that.

103
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,535
He doesn't even know
what he wrote about.

104
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,454
What was your paper about,
Wendy?

105
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,832
My paper was on the suffering
of bottle-nosed dolphins.

106
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,501
Well, you see, you shouldn't
have written

107
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,961
a paper about dolphins.

108
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,879
Dolphins are stupid.

109
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,547
Dude, dolphins are, like, the
second-smartest animal

110
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:16,632
on the planet.

111
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,300
[scoffs] Oh, right.

112
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,761
If they're so damn smart,
how come they get caught

113
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,930
in those fishing nets all the
time?

114
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,932
What?
Wait, wait, there's more.

115
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,726
It says here that Eric's trophy

116
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,272
will be presented to him by...

117
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,023
Kathie Lee Gifford?

118
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,150
Kathie Lee is coming to South
Park?

119
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,195
And the presentation will be
on national television.

120
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,655
Both: Television?

121
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,157
<i>Kathie Lee Gifford.</i>

122
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,742
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

123
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:47,329
Kathie Lee Gifford in South
Park.

124
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,290
Oh, my God.

125
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:52,209
This is our chance to make a
name for ourselves, to show

126
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,753
that we're not some pissant,
white-bread mountain town.

127
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,589
Better yet, it's a chance for
you to get some publicity.

128
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,968
Yes, if I can show just how
much I've turned South Park

129
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,304
around, I could become a
senator.

130
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,222
Maybe even a state senator.

131
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,641
Mayor, we should decorate the
town square.

132
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,311
Then we should have the chef
of the school cafeteria sing

133
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:13,314
a song and play up the ethnic
diversity of our town.

134
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,523
That's right.

135
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,150
He's a black guy, isn't he?

136
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,068
Black as the night itself,
Mayor.

137
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,238
Yes, and we can even have the
children of South Park

138
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,614
put on a little play.

139
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,616
Kathie Lee loves children.

140
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,410
If they're working in a
sweatshop, that is.

141
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,661
Oh!
Ouch.

142
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,663
[laughs]
Thank you.

143
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,540
You guys, guess what.

144
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,294
After I'm on television,
I'm gonna be totally famous.

145
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,171
Hitler was famous too.

146
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,297
Hello there, children.

147
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:39,798
Both: Hey, Chef.

148
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,050
How are my little crackers
today?

149
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,509
Good.

150
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,219
Did y'all hear about the news?

151
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,888
Kathie Lee Gifford is
coming to South Park.

152
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,306
Yeah, 'cause Cartman cheated
and won

153
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,891
the environmental essay contest.

154
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,517
Hey!
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

155
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,437
But the mayor just called and
asked me

156
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,230
to sing at the ceremony.

157
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,690
Wow, are you gonna do it?

158
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,692
Of course.

159
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,363
Kathie Lee is a beautiful,
sultry queen of sexual fantasy.

160
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,740
And if I sing to her, maybe I
can lure her into

161
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,327
a night of exotic delectation.

162
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,079
Yeah, that'd be cool.

163
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,955
[mumbling indistinctly]

164
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,501
Well, three times bigger than
Frank Gifford's, anyway.

165
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,087
Oh, I can't even concentrate
on grading papers

166
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,797
with all this excitement.

167
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,592
Why are you looking at me like
that, Mr. Hat?

168
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,053
Have you forgotten about all
the pain and suffering

169
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,097
that Kathie Lee Gifford caused
you?

170
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,183
Mr. Hat, that was a long time
ago, and...

171
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,893
And I was only a child.

172
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,812
We could've won that
talent show.

173
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,605
We could've been huge.

174
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,065
Knock-knock, Mr. Hat.

175
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,942
Who's there?
Orange.

176
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,485
Orange who?

177
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,862
Orange you glad
I didn't say banana?

178
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,783
Thank you.

179
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:52,121
Wow, Mr. Hat, looks like we
might win.

180
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:58,419
And now, our last talent show
finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein.

181
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,505
# If they could see me now,
that little gang of mine #

182
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,924
# I'm eating fancy chow
and drinking fancy wine #

183
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,468
# I'd like those stumble bums
to see for a fact #

184
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,513
# The kind of top-drawer
first-rate chums I attract #

185
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,182
# All I can say is wowee,
look at where I am #

186
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,018
# Tonight I landed pow
right in a pot of jam #

187
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:17,688
# What a setup, holy cow,
they'd never believe it #

188
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,941
# If my friends
could see me now #

189
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,443
[fireworks booming]

190
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,403
[cheers and applause]

191
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,616
It wasn't fair.

192
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,368
She had choreography.

193
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,245
How could we compete with that?

194
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,497
But now she's coming to
South Park,

195
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,791
and I know a way to
make it all better.

196
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,209
How?
[gasps]

197
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,462
No, Mr. Hat.

198
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,380
I couldn't...

199
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:47,426
kill Kathie Lee Gifford.

200
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,055
Children, as you all know,

201
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:55,559
Ms. Kathie Lee Gifford will be
in South Park to present

202
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,644
the award to some kid for an
essay.

203
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,605
That kid is me.
Whatever.

204
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,858
Now, I'm going to have you
luscious little youngsters

205
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,320
do a play about the history of
South Park.

206
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,697
That'll be wonderful, won't
it, Mr. Hat?

207
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,699
Kill her. Mr. Hat.

208
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,952
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you
to direct our little play.

209
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,662
Oh, that's perfect.

210
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,165
You see, Mr. Hat, we don't have
to kill her.

211
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,917
We can just upstage her.

212
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,376
Mrs. Mayor,

213
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,920
you might want to
review the essays.

214
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,796
We think Cartman might
have cheated.

215
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,715
Who cares?

216
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,470
Now, kids, what's say we give
it our South Park best?

217
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,265
And who's
our little prizewinner again?

218
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,059
Me, Eric Cartman.

219
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,894
How about we get in shape, huh?

220
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,772
We want to look our best for
the TV cameras, don't we?

221
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,148
Yes, ma'am.

222
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,858
# I'm gonna be on television #

223
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,985
# I'm gonna be on television #

224
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,614
# I'm gonna be on television #

225
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,574
# I'm gonna be on television #

226
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,159
We don't believe for a
minute that you won that

227
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,869
contest fairly, fat boy.

228
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,996
Ugh, stop defending your
little girlfriend

229
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,332
for writing about
some stupid fish.

230
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,751
Dude, dolphins are
intelligent and friendly.

231
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,337
Intelligent and friendly on
rye bread with some mayonnaise.

232
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,172
Dolphins are way smarter
than you.

233
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,883
If they're so smart, why do
they live in igloos?

234
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,218
Dolphins don't live in igloos.

235
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,511
That's Eskimos.

236
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,221
Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?

237
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,890
It's all a bunch of
tree-hugging hippie crap.

238
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,141
Tell me what you wrote about.

239
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,518
I can't.

240
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:20,894
I have to go home and get
in shape.

241
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,354
Yeah, right.

242
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,855
You'll go and sit in front
of the TV

243
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,399
and eat Cheesy Poofs,
ass-master.

244
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,025
Screw you, hippie.

245
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,738
<i>We'll be right back to
"Jesus and Pals" after this.</i>

246
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,074
<i>Hey, do you need to get in
shape fast?</i>

247
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,867
<i>Wanna look your best?</i>

248
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,619
<i>Tired of the other guys
getting all the chicks?</i>

249
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,204
<i>Are you tired of
being a 90-pound weakling?</i>

250
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,373
Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.

251
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,585
<i>Then bulk up quick with
Weight Gain 4000.</i>

252

Beefcake.

Beefcake!

261

Beefcake!

<i>May cause irreversible damage

263

Mom, can you get me some
Weight Gain 4000?

264
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,404
Okay, Eric, I'll get you some
at the store tomorrow.

265
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,532
But, Mom, I need it for
tomorrow.

266
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,493
But tomorrow is
grocery day, Eric.

267
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,330
Mom.
[whining]

268
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,206
Okay, okay.

269
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,917
Well, I guess I'll be going
to the store now, then.

270

No! No!

273
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,845
Kill her.

274
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,056
No, Mr. Hat. I won't do it.

275
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:42,726
Kill.

276
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,353
That does it.

277
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,814
You're going in the
dresser drawer, Mr. Hat.

278
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,525
She'll make a fool of you again.

279
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,070
Well, you can just stay in that
drawer, negative Nancy.

280
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,780
Hey, dudes.

281
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,448
What the hell is wrong with
you, Cartman?

282
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,699
Haven't you noticed the
three feet of snow

283
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,660
on the ground?

284
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,745
Listen, I have a nice body,
and I want to show it off.

285
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,330
You got that?

286
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,123
What?
You've got to weigh 90 pounds.

287
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,459
I'm up to 94, thank
you very much.

288
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,211
[mumbling indistinctly]

289
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,463
Yeah, they're almost as big
as his mom's.

290
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,631
[laughter]

291
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,466
Laugh all you want.

292

I'll the one who's gonna be on
TV looking all buff.

293
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,596
What's that stuff?
Weight Gain 4000.

294
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,181
It's helping me bulk up.

295
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,974
Bulk up to what, fat-ass?

296
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,643
Super fat-ass?

297
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,395
Hey, I don't have to take
that kind of crap

298
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,773
from you scrawny weaklings.

299
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,525
[grunting]

300
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,360
Sweet, check me out.

301
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,738
I'm such a beefcake I can't
get through the door.

302
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,323
Come on, people.

303
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,325
We've got to turn
this place around.

304
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,994
Hang up the lights, string up
the banners,

305
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,663
castrate the cows.

306
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,456
[cows mooing]

307
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,960
Well, Mr. Garrison, how is the
little play going?

308
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,628
Huh? Oh, fine.

309
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,088
We were just about to
run it from the top.

310
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,548
Oh, please do.

311
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,550
I'm dying to see it.

312
00:11:56,675 --> 00:12:00,095
Okay, all the little pioneers
on this side of the stage.

313
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,972
Good, and all the little Indians

314
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,640
go to the center of the stage.

315
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,101
Am I an Indian or a pioneer?

316
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,561
Do you have a feather on your
head?

317
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,521
Yes.
Then you're an Indian.

318
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,772
Oh.

319
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,649
Okay, Bebe, this is your line.

320
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:16,194
This is the story of South Park.

321
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,322
It begins over 100 years ago

322
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:24,327
when the noble and hearty Ute
Indians lived on the land.

323
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:27,873
[drums thumping]

324
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,542
Oh, don't they look adorable?

325
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,629
Then from the East came the
great white pioneers.

326
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,884
[together]
Ahh!

327
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,470
Oh, my God.

328
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,305
They did it
a lot better this morning.

329
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,848
They had more energy.

330
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,642
The pioneers met with the
Indians

331
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,938
and negotiated for
their fertile lands.

332
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,524
Mr. Garrison, we cannot have
our children

333
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,402
beating each other senseless
in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.

334
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,987
Well, what do you want?

335
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,572
This is how it happened
in those days.

336
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,949
Take that, you stupid Indian.
Ohh.

337
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:06,328
Mr. Garrison, this is not
appropriate.

338
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,247
Do you actually think that
Kathie Lee Gifford

339
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,791
would enjoy this?

340
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,542
To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford.

341
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,669
[all gasp]

342
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,047
[gasps]
Oh, my God. What have I said?

343
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:20,008
He said, "To hell with Kathie
Lee Gifford."

344
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:25,764
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing
you from directing our play.

345
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,974
[crickets chirping]

346
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,143
It happened again, didn't it?

347
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,271
Now we do things my way.

348
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,316
I can't kill her, Mr. Hat.

349
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,985
You're gonna have to do it.

350
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,822

00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,244
Whoa, Cartman, talk
about wide load.

352
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:50,121
Yeah, I'm really starting to
fill out nicely.

353
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,832
You're not filling out nicely.

354
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,124
You're fatter than ever.

355
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,209
I'm not fat.

356
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,961
I'm getting in shape.

357
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,796
Cartman, you're such a
fat-ass that when you walk

358
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,798
down the street, people go,
"God damn it.

359
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,424
That's a big fat-ass."

360
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,802
No, they don't, you
jealous weakling.

361
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,513
God damn,
that's a big fat-ass.

362
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,139
Hey!

363
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,892
Hi, guys.
Oh, look, another hippie.

364
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,853
Peace, Wendy.
Shut up, Cartman.

365
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,604
Oh.

# Two little hippies

367
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,316
I'm gonna find Cartman's paper

368
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,735
and get to the bottom of this.

369
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,613
Can I help you?

370
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:24,906
Yes.

371
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,700
I need a gun.

372
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,327
Would this be for hunting or
protection or other?

373
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,996
Other.
Alrighty then.

374
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,748
May I suggest a Stratford
12-millimeter?

375
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,500
Go ahead.
Try it on.

376
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,752
That looks really nice on you.

377
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,171
The lacquered black
really matches your eyes.

378
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,673
You talking to me?

00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,675
You talking to me?

380
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,635
I don't know,
it's a little small.

381
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,929
Okay.
How about this?

You talking to me?

383
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,641
Hmm, no, I don't like this one
either.

384
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,269
Here's the same gun
with a wood finish.

385
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,729
You talking to me?

386
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,522
I don't see anybody else
around here,

387
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,025
so you must be talking to me.

388
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,443
I'll take it.

surprised when she gets here
tomorrow.

She beat us in the talent

clear shot... or a view of Kathie

You know, Kathie Lee, you are
a very special woman.

00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:12,175
I don't mean special in a Mary
Tyler Moore way

462
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,971
or special in an extra-value
meal at Happy Burger way.

No, no, no, no, no.

night long.

Is there somewhere in town
where I can get a good, clear

494
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,462
Damn, he could be anywhere.

00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,423
I'll send out an APB.

Mr. Garrison, stop.

505
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,075
Leave us.

506
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,077
We must finish what
we have begun.

507
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,079
I know that she's hurt you.

508
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,497
She's hurt a lot of people.

You can't know.

510
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,501
You should've won
that talent show.

511
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,296
It is with a great honor and
pride that I present

512
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,173
the winner this trophy.

513
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,258
Eric, would you please come
up here?

514
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,887
Here it is, my big
moment of fame.

515
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,514
And then she finished it
all by throwing her voice

516
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,433
with two dummies at once.

517
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,228
I know that, Mr. Garrison,
but this isn't the answer.

518
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,814
It is too late for
me, young Wendy.

519
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,277
You see, I've learned
something today.

520
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,196
You can't win all the time.

521
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,907
And if you don't win, you
certainly can't hold it against

522
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:44,035
the person who did, because
that's the only way

523
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,912
you ever really lose.

524
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,331
You're... you're right.

525
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,458
Good.

526
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,419
Man, did she really throw her
voice with two dummies at once?

527
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,046
The bitch must die.

528
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,716
Ahh!

529
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,677
[mumbles indistinctly]

530
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,141
Oh, my God.
They killed Kenny.

531
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,102
You bastard.

532
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:10,687
Gun!
Gun!

533
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,397
Hey, come back.

534
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:13,982
We didn't even get to do
our play.

535
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,817
All: Aww.

536
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,568
I guess that's it, guys.
Wrap it up.

537
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,737
Hey, wait a minute.

538
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,698
When do I get to be on
television?

539
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,032
Forget it, kid.

540
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,742
No Kathie Lee, no
public interest.

541
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:28,329
But I won the environmental
essay contest.

542
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,957
You don't
deserve to win, Cartman,

543
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,625
and you know it.

544
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,378
I'm holding Cartman's
award-winning paper.

545
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,797
It's actually nothing more
than "Walden"

546
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,008
with Henry David Thoreau's
name crossed out

547
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,468
and Cartman's
name written in its place.

548
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,970
Who cares?

549
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,763
Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.

550
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,057
What about not holding
anything against

551
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,350
the person who wins?

552
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,894
Well, not if it's Cartman.

553
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,397
Hey, where are you all going?

554
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,108
They don't even know what
"Walden" is.

555
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:01,029
I bet if "Walden" was a sitcom
you'd all know what it was.

556
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:02,780
Come on, Wendy.

557
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,198
Kyle's mom will make us
tuna fish sandwiches.

558
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,700
Oh, what the hell.

559
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,578
[sobbing] No, no.

560
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:11,539
Now I'll be stuck in
this Podunk town forever

561
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,834
with all these stupid, hick,
redneck, jobless,

562
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,836
truck-driving idiots.

563
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,464
Uh, Mayor, the mic is on.

564
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:22,133
Thought you could get
away with it, eh, Mr. Hat?

565
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,634
Well, I would have gotten
away with it

566
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,470
if it weren't
for those meddling kids.

567
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,388
You're lucky you missed
Kathie Lee Gifford

568
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,932
and that nobody got hurt.

569
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,520
We hope you can come
back to school real soon,

570
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,356
Mr. Garrison.

571
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,857
Well, children, I'd love to,
but the doctors say

572
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,859
that Mr. Hat needs more
therapy.

573
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,236
We can still get her.

574
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:45,114
I'm just so sorry that I ruined
everyone's chances

575
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,574
for being on TV.

576
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,784
Not Cartman.

577
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,285
He gets to be on TV anyway.

578
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,037
Really? On what?

579
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:55,124
Obesity, adiposity, corpulence.

580
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:58,252
Whatever word you use, it
represents one thing:

581
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,171
being a big fat-ass.

582
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,924
We have with us today live via
satellite Eric Cartman

583
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,884
from South Park,

584
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,304
who is now so obese, he can't
even get out of his house.

585
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,598
When is this gonna be on the
air?

586
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,976
Is there anything you'd like
to say to people out there?

587
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,020
Follow your dreams.

588
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,939
You can reach your goals.

589
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,524
I'm living proof.

590
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,692
Beefcake. Beefcake!

591
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,195
He needs to run his ass
around the block a few times.

592
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,490
Mmm, how about a little more
of that good loving, Chef?

593
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,158
Damn, woman.

594
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,035
I just gave you sweet
loving five minutes ago.

595
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,912
You trying to kill me?
