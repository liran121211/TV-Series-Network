1
00:00:02,378 --> 00:00:03,754
I know a certain
kitty-kitty

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:04,964
who's sleeping
with mommy tonight.

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:06,424
[laughter]

4
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,551
That is a hoot and a holler.

5
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:11,345
This next episode
is by far our favorite.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,180
It's called "Volcano."

7
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,974
In it, the boys go camping
with Stan's uncle Jimbo

8
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,434
and his friend Ned.

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,019
While camping, they encounter

10
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:20,229
a strange creature
in a deadly volcano.

11
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,939
I think the reason
that this episode is,

12
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,025
well, Scratch's favorite anyway

13
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,568
is because it deals
with an issue

14
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,611
that is really important
to Matt and I.

15
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:30,072
You see, we grew up
in the Colorado Rockies,

16
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,366
and there black bear
hunting is illegal.

17
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,785
Well, a few years ago
a man shot a black bear

18
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,829
and her two cubs out of a tree.

19
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,456
When taken to jail the man said,

20
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,374
"Well, they were coming
right for us,"

21
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,251
but he'd shot the black bears
out of a tree,

22
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,794
so it was ridiculous.

23
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,297
That's not funny.

24
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:48,466
What America's
really dying to know is,

25
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,718
is there really a Scuzzlebutt?

26
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,721
People have to understand,
these are all works of fiction.

27
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,347
There's no such thing as aliens.

28
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:57,099
There's no such thing
as Scuzzlebutt.

29
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,518
And there's no such thing
as Patrick Duffy.

30
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,480
What happened to Ned to cause
him to speak the way he does?

31
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,482
Well, Ned is actually
our favorite character

32
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,192
in all of South Park.

33
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:09,653
He had a laryngectomy
from smoking too much

34
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,614
and got throat cancer.

35
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,365
[imitating electronic speech]
So now he talks like this.

36
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,786
I guess we can all take
a lesson from Ned.

37
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:20,164
So sit back, relax
and enjoy "Volcano."

38

# So come on

52
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:56,492
# And meet some friends
of mine #

53
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,661
Now you be careful, Eric.

54
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,122
The woods can be very dangerous.

55
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:04,250
Okay, Mom.

56
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,210
Ready to go hunting, Cartman?

57
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,671
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says
we gotta get up there early.

58
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:09,713
Right, Uncle Jimbo?

59
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,507
That's right, Stanley.

60
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,634
Animals are much easier
to shoot in the morning.

61
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,136
Here, hon.

62
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,680
I packed you Cheesy Poofs
and Happy Tarts.

63
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,224
Don't worry, Miss Cartman,
we'll take care of him.

64
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,352
I brought my old war buddy,
Ned, to keep things safe.

65
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,022
Hello, Mrs. Cartman.
How are you today?

66
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,275
Be sure to use
lots of bug spray,

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,860
and if you have
to poo-poo,

68
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,028
don't wipe with poison ivy.

69
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,656
[laughter]
Dude, that's sick, Mom!

70
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,826
And I know it can get scary
up in those woods,

71
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:42,663
but just remember,
Mommy's not far away.

72
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,082
[laughter]
Drive! Drive!

73
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,209
You give your mommy a kissy.

74
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,128
Drive the car, damn it!
Drive!

75
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:53,507
"Don't get scared up
in the mountains, Cartman."

76
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,759
Shut up!
I'm not scared of nothing.

77
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,387
Maybe your mom can give me
a kiss too, Cartman.

78
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,930
[muffled speech]

79
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,017
Oh, oh!
That's disgusting.

80
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,186
You piece of crap!
I'll kill you!

81
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,854
That's the spirit, boys.

82
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,023
Let's get that
testosterone flowing.

83
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,858
Yeeh!

84
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,194
Now, boys, boys, I need
to get serious for a minute.

85
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,280
I want you to understand
a few basic rules of hunting,

86
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,990
since this is your first time.

87
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,159
First of all, don't
ever walk with your gun

88
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:21,869
unless the safety's on.

89
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,205
Second, don't shoot anything
that looks human.

90
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,041
And third, never spill your
beer in the bullet chamber.

91
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,376
Uh, Uncle Jimbo,
we don't drink beer.

92
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,461
You what?!

93
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,087
Yeah, that's right,

94
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,340
I don't think eight-year-old
kids drink beer.

95
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,342
I like chocolate milk!

96
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,844
Well, we'll be doing plenty
of drinking on this trip.

97
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,014
After all,
hunter sober is like...

98
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,308
Fishing... sober.

99
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,477
It sure will be nice
to get out of the city

100
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,646
for a while,
away from civilization.

101
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,486
Well, here we are.

102
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,864
Okay, each of you young'uns
take a gun, a beer,

103
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,824
and some smokes.

104
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,869
Hey, I didn't get a gun.

105
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,914
Sweet. This is like
the gun I used in 'Nam.

106
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,707
You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.

107
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,960
Were you stationed in Da Nang?

108
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,378
Cartman always
makes stuff up, Ned.

109
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:13,963
You can't believe
anything he says.

110
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,923
Hey, I'll blow
your freaking head off.

111
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,425
Hey, look out, son.
That's dangerous.

112
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,302
You're gonna spill your beer.

113
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,767
My Uncle Jimbo
says that after this

114
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,644
he's gonna take me
hunting in Africa.

115
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,562
Wow, that'll be cool.

116
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:34,233
My mom says there's a lot
of black people in Africa.

117
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,901
Boys, lookie there.

118
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,320
That there is
a Rocky Mountain black bear.

119
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,863
One of the few remaining
of its kind.

120
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,032
Isn't it beautiful?

121
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,951
My God,
it's coming right for us!

122
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,164
Hey, it wasn't
coming right for us.

123
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,625
It was just sitting there.
Shh, not so loud.

124
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,669
Now that there
is just a technicality.

125
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,337
What do you mean?
You see, boys,

126
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,339
the Democrats have passed
a lot of laws

127
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,924
trying to stop us from hunting.

128
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,676
Democrats piss me off!

129
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,761
They say we can't shoot
certain animals anymore

130
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,055
unless they're posing
an immediate threat.

131
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,141
Therefore,
before we shoot something,

132
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,685
we have to say,
"It's coming right for us."

133
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,353
Wow, you're smart, Uncle Jimbo.

134
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,522
Jimbo, look.

135
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,733
Oh, it's a deer.

136
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:19,194
Looks like about
a 45-gauge, Ned.

137
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,114
It's coming right for us!

138
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,036
Kickass!

139
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,829
Did you see that?

140
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,165
I was imperiled by
that ferocious, charging buck.

141
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,917
Rabbit, rabbit, five o'clock.

142
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,880
Let's move!
Move!

143
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,049
Is this hunting?
I guess so.

144
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,760
Uh, dude, I'm starting
to have flashbacks.

145
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:45,179
What?
Stand forth, pull up flank.

146
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,931
Look out for Charlies
up in the trees.

147
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,937
This one's yours, Stan.

148
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,777
It's coming right for us.
It's coming right for us.

149
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,033
Shoot it, Stan.
I got your back, soldier.

150
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:10,162
I can't.

151
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,997
What the...
What's wrong with you?

152
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,582
I don't wanna shoot the bunny.

153
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,042
What the hell
are you talking about,

154
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,668
you don't wanna shoot the bunny?

155
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,295
You're babbling,
you're not making any sense.

156
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,797
You're hysterical.
I'm not hysterical.

157
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,548
I just don't wanna
shoot the bunny.

158
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,300
No nephew of mine
is gonna be a tree-hugger.

159
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,094
Yeah, hippie,
go back to Woodstock

160
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,970
if you can't shoot anything.

161
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,264
I can shoot you, fatass!
I can shoot you, too!

162
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,517
I'll kill you!
I'll fill you full of lead!

163
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,435
[rumbling]

164
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,562
Hey, what's that?

168
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,036
Hmm?

169
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,956
What the heck is this?

170
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,666
Yeah, Frank.
It's Randy.

171
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,043
Uh-huh. Good.

172
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,130
Yeah, listen,
the little needle is moving.

173
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,923
Yeah, it's going
back and forth really fast.

174
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,843
What does that mean?
Uh-huh?

175
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:09,638
Uh-huh.
Let me check.

176
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,558

Scuzzlebutt is a creature

on this very mountain

265

Why?

267
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,991
Because it loves
the taste of blood

268
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,578

to its deformed body.

00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,998
Well, on his left arm

271
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,292
instead of a hand, he has...

272
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,710
A hook.
A knife.

273
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,963
No, a piece of celery.
Celery?

274
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,007
Yes, and he walks with a limp,

275
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,426

his legs is missing.

276
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,261

277
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:21,264

ever seen "Step by Step?"

00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,911
are camping on that mountain
and... uh, I'm sorry.

354
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,788
Can I start over?
Huh?

355
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:35,584
You can edit this, right?
Ready? Three, two, one.

356
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,335
All we know right now

357
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,087
is that some of our children

358
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,172
are up camping on that mountain.

359
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,009
We can't do anything
until we get them.

360
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:49,055
Okay, people,
let's go get those kids!

361
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,058
Come on, everybody.
You gotta help the children.

362
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,313
Well, he couldn't have gone far.

363
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,064
Unless something drug him off.

364
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,818
There's not many animals
out today, Jimbo.

365
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,863
Yeah, it's almost like
something funny's going on.

366
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,490
[rumbling]

367
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,492
Christ, Ned, what'd
you have for breakfast?

368
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,662
I don't know, man.
I've got some bad gas.

369
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,040
Wait, there's a ram.

370
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,875
It's coming right for us!

371
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,796
Nice shooting, Kenny!

372
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,090
Here, you need a bigger gun.

373
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:27,135
Look!
I am Scuzzlebutt,

374
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,929
Lord of the mountains.

375
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,306
Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.

376
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,099
What is it?

377
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,185
Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt!
Cartman wasn't lying.

378
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,229
Holy crow! We could make
a mint killing this thing.

379
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:41,024
We'll be on the cover
of "Guns & Ammo."

380
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,693
This calls for some HJ-14.

381
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,613
[chuckles] Those guys
are totally scared.

382
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,074
Fire in the hole!

383
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,993
Holy crap!

384
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,247
Damn it, I think I missed.

385
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,667
What the hell
is wrong with you people?

386
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,835
Come on, let's move!
Move!

387
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,755
Wait, wait, ahhh!

388
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,423
Is it on?
Okay.

389
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,343
Okay, people, form groups
and search the mountain.

390
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,262
Report back here every hour.
You got that?

391
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,432
Mayor, I might have an idea.
Oh, what?

392
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,393
Well, if we can dig
a very large trench,

393
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,062
we can divert the lava
into a canyon,

394
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,315
and then it would bypass South
Park pretty much completely.

395
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,401
And that would be good, right?

396
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,860
I'm pretty sure.

397
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,946
Well, what are we waiting for?

398
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,156
Okay, people, change of plans.

399
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,242
Half of you grabs shovels.

400
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,995
These look like his tracks.
He must have gone this way.

401
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,081
Ned, prepare some HK-12
and some Plasticine.

402
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,667
I'll bet that sucker is headed
for a higher elevation.

403
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,753
The higher up it... bird!

404
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,256
The higher up it goes,
the better it can breathe.

405
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,717
Look, up there!

406
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,553
You guys, it's just me.

407
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,388
Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?

408
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,348
Does it have
Patrick Duffy for a leg?

409
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,183
I can't tell.
Let's kill it.

410
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,145
Got to get out
of this stupid costume.

411
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,730
Kenny, you take the front.

412
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,481
No, I can do it, Uncle Jimbo.

413
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,108
I want to bag that animal.

414
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,777
That's the spirit, kiddo.
Let's hunt!

415
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,863
You guys, you guys,
I was just kidding!

416
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,573
As some people of South Park

417
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,283
try desperately
to save their mountain town,

418
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,243
others look
for the missing townspeople.

419
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,996
But all must take
every precaution necessary.

420
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,081
Okay, people, listen up.

421
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,375
As we near the top
of the mountain,

422
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,171
the chances of our encountering
some lava becomes great.

423
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,465
Therefore,
I have special ordered

424
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,633
this training film to assist us

425
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,635
in volcano safety.

426
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,763
Mr. Garrison,
if you would, please.

427
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,640
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

428
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,018
Harbingers of sorrow,
natural disasters can be

429
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,771
the cause of troubling
and undesirable stress,

430
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,981
and a volcano is no exception.

431
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,400
But what should you do
if a volcano erupts near you

432
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,027
or your family?

433
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,987
<i>Here, we see the Stephens Family</i>

434
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,697
<i>enjoying... Sunday picnic.</i>

435
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,908
<i>But suddenly,
daughter hears a noise.</i>

436
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,077
<i>It's a volcano.
Junior seems worried.</i>

437
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,745
<i>But have no fear, Junior.</i>

438
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,288
<i>Jane learned in school
what to do</i>

439
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,041
<i>when you hear a volcano erupt.</i>

440
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,710
<i>That's right, Jane,
duck and cover.</i>

441
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,047
[rumbling]

442
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:13,093
<i>So what will... do when you
hear a volcano erupting?</i>

443
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,096
<i>That's right, duck and cover.</i>

444
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,181
<i>Looks like you got the idea.</i>

445
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,183
Duck and cover.

446
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,852
Thank you and good-bye.

447
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,854
Okay, any questions?

448
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,315
That has got to be
the most ridiculous

449
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,318
load of pig crap
I have ever seen.

450
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,278
That's enough out of you!

451
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,989
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt,

452
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,991
then we'll see
who's a little bastard.

453
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:40,161
Hey, seriously, you guys!

454
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,913
Kill it, Stan.
Kill it.

455
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,963
Come on, Stan, kill it!

456
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,923
Oh, damn it, I can't do it!

457
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,092
You pansy!
Give me that gun.

458
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,302
Hey!
Cartman?

459
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,929
God damn it, don't shoot me!

460
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,514
What the Sam Hill?

461
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,307
I was just trying
to scare you guys.

462
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,976
You can put the gun down now.

463
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:06,104
So much for the cover
of "Guns & Ammo."

464
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,148
Yepper,
but I think we've learned

465
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,316
some important lessons, Ned. I think...

466
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,318
Whoa!

467
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,028
Holy crap.

468
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,406
The mountain,
it's blown its top!

469
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,616
[rumbling]

470
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,830
Oh, my God, they killed Kenny!

471
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,957
No, I'm okay.
[screaming]

472
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,128
Look, the volcano.

473
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,255
Quick, duck and cover!

474
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,966
[all screaming]

475
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,344
That lava is coming
right for us.

476
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,597
Oh, no, look.

477
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,142
What the hell is this
trench doing here?

478
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,894
We can't get across!

479
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,896
It now looks
as if the missing children

480
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,231
are trapped in the path
of hot, nasty lava.

481
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:54,194
God, please deliver
those darling kids from...

482
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,197
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Three, two and one.

483
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,449
God, please deliver...

484
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,159
Help!

485
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,831

Jiminy, it's the real
Scuzzlebutt!

488
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,631
What?
Scuzzlebutt's real?

489
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,674
Oh, my God!
Look at his leg!

490
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,552
Hi, kids,
I'm TV's Patrick Duffy.

491
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,679
Quick, Ned, shoot it!

492
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:25,391

Oh, no, out of ammo.

00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,726

494
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,270
What is that thing?

495
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,272
That's Scuzzlebutt.

496
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,567
Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy
for a leg and weaves baskets.

497
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,362
This isn't happening.
Everyone look away, please.

498
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,405
Nothing to see here.

499
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,909
Well, boys, I'm sorry
I got you all killed.

##

503
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,004
Whoa, he built a wicker basket.

504
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,423
Hey, he's saving us.

506
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,389
Scuzzlebutt saved the day.

507
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:06,266
And my calculations worked.

508
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:09,644
The lava's following
the trench into the canyon.

509
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,772
Hmm, where exactly
does the canyon go?

510
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,565
Uh...

00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,903

512
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,990
South Park is saved.

Hey, look, Kenny's okay.
[muffled speech]

514
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,997
And now these humble people
can rejoice and celebrate

515
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,708
their jovial victory
over nature.

516
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,335
I'm getting word that the chef
of the school cafeteria

517
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,047
wants to sing a song about this
thrilling struggle of humanity.

518
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:41,926
# Ooh baby every time
that we kiss #

519
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,553
# Hot lava #

520
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,805
# Every time that
we make love, hot lava #

521
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,390
# Hot lava #

522
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,183
# Lava so hot
it makes me sweat #

523
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,852
# Lava so warm and red and wet #

00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,395
# Lava #

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,813
Mayor, what do you have to say

526
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,189
about this wonderful outcome?

527
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,317
Well, we owe everything

528
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:01,529
to this friendly,
yet misunderstood creature.

529
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,324
Thank you, Scuzzlebutt.

530
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:05,867
Friend.

531
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,703
Oh, how sweet.

532
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,666
I did it, I did it!
I finally killed something.

533
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,168
Oh, my God, what has he done?

534
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,669
Turn off the cameras.

535
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,338
Hey, that was easy.

536
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,256
No!

537
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,383
Why, God?
Why?

538
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,677
Damn it, Stan.
You shouldn't have done that.

539
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,054
What, why?

540
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,972
Yeah, make up your mind, dude.

541
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,350
Stan, some things you kill
and some things you don't. See?

542
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,809
No.

543
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,770
Only now, in this late hour,

544
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,897
do I see the folly of guns.

545
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,275
I'll never use a gun again.

546
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,527
[gunshot]
[muffled screaming]

547
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,199
But I just wanted you
to be proud of me,

548
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:47,450
like you were with Kenny.

549
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,243
But Kenny's dead now, Stan.

550
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,329
And you're always gonna
be my nephew.

551
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,581
And you just
can't kill anything.

552
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,291
You understand?

553
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,335
Dude, I don't
understand hunting at all.

554
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,462
Yeah, it's stupid.
Let's go watch cartoons.

555
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,589
Yeah, cartoons kick ass.
