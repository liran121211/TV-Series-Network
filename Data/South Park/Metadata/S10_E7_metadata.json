Mr. Mackey recommends that Mrs. Cartman try some Nanny reality shows to help straighten out Cartman's behavior. When both Nanny 911 and Supernanny fail, a doctor at a psychiatric ward (where Supernanny is now staying) tells Mrs. Cartman about Cesar Millan aka \"The Dog Whisperer\". Cartman's mom hires Cesar and the two start running Cartman's life, controlling him by nipping him on the neck and making a \"Tsst\" sound when he is bad. Cesar tries to get Mrs. Cartman to be the \"dominant leader of the pack\" and tries to get Eric Cartman to stop his \"aggressive dominant behavior\". All of these changes in Cartman's life start to piss him off and he plots to kill his mom. He then goes to her room with a knife and paper towels but before he kills her his conscience gets a hold of him telling he he shouldn't of should do it.\u2014Jared Silberkleit"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0799356", "rating": 9.1, "votes": 5138, "number_of_episodes": 328}
