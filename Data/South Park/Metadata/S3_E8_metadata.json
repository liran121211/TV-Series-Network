While giving his guests a tour of the house, Mr. Mackey shows off his new hot tub. Declaring the night to be a time of experimentation, Stan's father and Kyle's father get in the tub together as the other guests go downstairs. After talking for a while about trying new things, they decide to masturbate together. This causes Stan's father to have misgivings about his sexuality and to feel increasingly guilty as the night goes on. Meanwhile, the ATF has the house surrounded, thinking the guests are a crazed religious cult planning to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705980", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 3306, "number_of_episodes": 328}
