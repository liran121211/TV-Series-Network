They decide to give it a try, motivated less by the thought of helping someone less fortunate, than by the offer of a sports watch for every sponsor. Expecting their watch to arrive, the boys are surprised to find an Ethiopian boy delivered to their door. When the mix-up is discovered, the FBI quickly swings into action, only to ship Cartman to Ethiopia instead. Meanwhile, Dr. Mephisto's new flock of genetically engineered turkeys has decided not to go quietly to the chopping block.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705964", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 4416, "number_of_episodes": 328}
