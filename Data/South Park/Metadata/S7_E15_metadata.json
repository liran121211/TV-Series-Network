The Broflovski's are outraged and go to court but lose and Ike is forced to return to Canada with his birth parent's. Kyle then goes to Stan, Kenny and Cartman and asks them to help him go to Canada and appeal to the Canadian prime minister to change his mind, they immediately say no because they might not get to have a christmas adventure. A few days later, at the lighting of the town christmas tree, the mayor and the towns people decide to show their support to the Broflovski's by not buying any presents for their children and instead, give all their money to them. Again Kyle asks Stan, Kenny and Cartman and they say yes. Not long after, the boys are on the phone trying to get a flight to Canada. They then call City Wok and Mr Lu Kim answers the phone and when it is revealed that they are looking for City Airlines Mr Lu Kim turns the 'City Wok' Sign around revealing 'City Airlines' underneath and puts a pilot hat on. After negotiations about the price of the flight they eventually reach the agreement of $62.
