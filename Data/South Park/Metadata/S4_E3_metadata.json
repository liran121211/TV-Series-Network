Meanwhile, the boys are diagnosed with ADD and heavily medicated.", "Timmy arrives in South Park as a new student. Although he is obviously intellectually disabled and is only capable of saying his name, none of the teachers recognize this fact and instead diagnose him as having ADD and give him Ritalin.
