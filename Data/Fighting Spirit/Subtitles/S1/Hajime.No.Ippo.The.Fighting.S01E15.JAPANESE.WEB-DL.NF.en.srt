ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,666
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:37,375
{\an8}KORAKUEN HALL

4
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,791
His strategy was to hit simultaneously!

5
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,458
No number of bodies
is enough for that strategy!

6
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,083
Still, the same can be said for Ozuma.

7
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,916
Counting on your own guts
may be a primitive strategy...

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but to combat Ozuma's superior
speed and technique...

9
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,250
this might be the best strategy
for Ippo to put his power in play.

10
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,458
<i>What a punch!</i>

11
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:14,541
<i>This match won't be decided by points,
no matter how it ends.</i>

12
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,583
<i>Which fighter will survive?</i>

13
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,125
<i>This is definitely worth watching!</i>

14
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:26,125
TEST OF ENDURANCE

15
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,875
{\an8}ROUND 2 - REMAINING TIME
2 MINUTES 38 SECONDS

16
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,291
Atta boy! Keep pounding on each other!

17
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,625
Stop his barrage,
and you're fighting on even ground!

18
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,375
Go, kid!

19
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,875
<i>All right, I can make it.
I'll keep hitting till the very end!</i>

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,166
Wow, they hit each other again!

21
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,791
Is he winning or losing? Which is it?!

22
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,125
I can't tell!

23
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,333
Ozuma, you can do it!

24
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,375
We're cheering you on!

25
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,791
God, he took another full blow!
Who do you think is winning?

26
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't know. It looks even.

27
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:30,166
If so, then the odds are against Ippo.
He's still damaged from round one.

28
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,333
Guess you're right.

29
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,375
Ippo! Show us what you got,
and knock him down!

30
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:45,666
<i>No matter how it hurts, keep telling
yourself you didn't feel a thing!</i>

31
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,458
<i>I'm fine. I'm still fine.</i>

32
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,916
<i>I didn't feel a thing!</i>

33
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,750
<i>My legs are starting to give out.</i>

34
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,875
<i>If we keep hitting each other
like this, I'll go down first.</i>

35
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,333
<i>No! Makunouchi has to have more damage!</i>

36
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,583
<i>He'll be the one to go down first!</i>

37
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,250
<i>Got him! How did you like that?</i>

38
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,458
<i>That's impossible!</i>

39
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,583
<i>That's impossible!</i>

40
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,458
<i>He punched back without even a twitch!</i>

41
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,208
<i>It didn't hurt!</i>

42
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:30,958
<i>It'll take more than that!</i>

43
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,250
<i>Aren't my punches doing any damage?!
That's impossible!</i>

44
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,458
<i>Impossible!</i>

45
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:44,541
<i>I didn't feel a thing!</i>

46
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,791
<i>He has to be feeling something!</i>

47
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,916
<i>He has to be!</i>

48
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,375
<i>How about that?!</i>

49
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,666
<i>You'll have to do better!</i>

50
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,750
<i>He's still punching back?!</i>

51
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,500
<i>His punches are still at full power!</i>

52
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,958
<i>Are you immortal, Makunouchi?!</i>

53
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:12,250
Don't pull back, Ozuma!
Makunouchi is at death's door!

54
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,208
He's making a last-ditch, suicide attack!

55
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,250
With a bit more effort,
he'll fall to the mat!

56
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,958
Don't lose confidence,
and use everything you've got on him!

57
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:23,583
<i>He's right! Makunouchi
must be in more pain than me.</i>

58
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,166
<i>He's just trying to look tough!</i>

59
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,958
<i>I can beat him with one more try!</i>

60
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,041
Kid, Ozuma isn't liking it!

61
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,458
Put more pressure on him! Duke it out!

62
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,583
They're rooted in place,
giving each other KO punches.

63
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,833
Yeah...

64
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,250
It's awesome.

65
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,958
Neither one is pulling away.

66
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,458
That takes courage!

67
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,250
They've got guts!

68
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,791
Go, Makunouchi!

69
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,750
Knock him down!

70
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,291
Ozuma, don't lose!

71
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,250
Knock him out!

72
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,041
All right, it worked!

73
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,250
-Ozuma!
-Now's your chance!

74
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,250
Finish him, Ozuma!

75
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,083
Wow, he punched back!
He has some juice left!

76
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,208
Keep going, Makunouchi!

77
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,166
He's a monster!

78
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,000
He's tough!

79
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,125
<i>I'm not through yet. I'm still okay.</i>

80
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,125
<i>It didn't hurt! It didn't...</i>

81
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,625
It hit!

82
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,500
<i>This is it!
If I don't finish him now, I'll lose!</i>

83
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,625
Kid!

84
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,083
<i>It doesn't h...</i>

85
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,833
<i>I still don't feel a...</i>

86
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,166
-He went down!
-His strength finally failed him!

87
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,083
No way he can get up from that!

88
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,791
<i>I did it!</i>

89
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,125
We won! That was decisive.

90
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,833
He won't be able to get up after that!

91
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,625
<i>Everything looks kind of wiggly.</i>

92
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,541
<i>For some reason, I feel pretty good now.</i>

93
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,166
<i>Huh? What is that?</i>

94
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,416
<i>There's some weird thing over there.</i>

95
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,583
<i>I think it's shouting something.</i>

96
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,875
<i>Oh, well. Who cares?</i>

97
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,083
Get up!

98
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,958
Get up, kid! Get up!

99
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,416
<i>Chief!</i>

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,416
<i>I see... I was knocked down.</i>

101
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,666
Stand up! What's the matter?
Is that all the grit you got?!

102
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,666
Stand up, you!

103
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,041
<i>Damn! My limbs are lifeless!</i>

104
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:10,208
<i>At this rate, even if I do stand up,
I'll be knocked right back down again.</i>

105
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,833
<i>What?</i>

106
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,916
<i>Why does he look so anxious?</i>

107
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:24,000
<i>I'm the one who fell.
Victory is within his grasp.</i>

108
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,750
<i>I get it! I'm not the only one!</i>

109
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,500
<i>He's suffering too!</i>

110
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,750
<i>If I can get on my feet...
If I can just get on my feet,</i>

111
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,000
<i>I may have a chance!</i>

112
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,125
Is he trying to get up?!

113
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,000
No way. He's down for the count.

114
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,458
-Ippo!
-Get up!

115
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,541
Hey, he's trying to get up!

116
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,208
Stay down!

117
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,750
<i>He can't possibly get up!</i>

118
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,250
-Please get up, Ippo!
-Get up!

119
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,750
Kid!

120
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,750
<i>No way!</i>

121
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,750
-He's up!
-Is this guy even human?

122
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,500
Go for it, Makunouchi!

123
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,291
-He actually got up!
-He's awesome!

124
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,791
<i>How can he possibly get back up?</i>

125
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,291
-Well, can you go on?
-I can. I can go on!

126
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,791
<i>Does this mean my punches
have no effect on him?</i>

127
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,750
<i>As long as I'm standing up,
I have a chance.</i>

128
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,291
<i>I have a chance!</i>

129
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,708
Ozuma, this is your chance!
Don't hesitate!

130
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,791
-Knock him down once more, and you win!
-Keep fighting!

131
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,875
I'm glad he's up,
but there's almost a whole minute to go.

132
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,666
He won't last long like that.

133
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,791
Yeah.

134
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,291
-Go, Makunouchi!
-Take Ozuma down!

135
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:52,291
<i>Dammit, get a hold of yourself!
Keep looking at your opponent!</i>

136
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:02,250
Ozuma, your opponent is thrashed!
You can beat him!

137
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,250
<i>What am I afraid of?! Don't wimp out!</i>

138
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,208
<i>If I knock him down one more time,
victory will be mine!</i>

139
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,083
<i>Take this!</i>

140
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,083
<i>Oh, no! I over-swung and lost my balance!</i>

141
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,791
He did it!

142
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,625
It's a surprise reversal!

143
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,291
What an incredible body blow!

144
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,625
Chief! He knocked him down!

145
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah, he did great!
Ozuma was so worried about

146
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,291
knocking him down, that he gave the kid
an opportunity with that long swing.

147
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,541
<i>I did it!</i>

148
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,875
<i>Oh, no. It really got him!</i>

149
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,083
Ozuma...

150
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,291
<i>What destructive power!</i>

151
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,333
<i>He turned the match around
with a single punch!</i>

152
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,333
<i>Please don't get up.</i>

153
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,833
Hang in there, Ozuma!

154
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,416
You had him cornered
and almost had him finished, remember?!

155
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,375
Do you really want to lose like this?!
Stand up, Ozuma!

156
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,416
<i>Mama-san...</i>

157
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,750
If we don't cheer him up, who will?!
Ozuma, get up!

158
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,041
Keep going, Ozuma!

159
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,250
-We know you can do it!
-Ozuma!

160
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,625
Ozuma!

161
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,583
<i>Everyone...</i>

162
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,291
<i>But I felt an enormous impact.</i>

163
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,916
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

164
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,041
-He's up!
-I don't believe it!

165
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,541
Now Ozuma's showing his grit!

166
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,916
<i>But I felt an enormous impact.</i>

167
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,916
Ozuma...

168
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,416
-Can you go on, Ozuma?
-I'm all right.

169
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,416
<i>What a spirit he's got.
But I can't lose, either!</i>

170
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,666
<i>I don't want to lose!</i>

171
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,500
They're both staggering.
I have no idea where this is going!

172
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,666
Go for it, both of you!

173
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,208
I'll witness it to the bitter end!

174
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,291
A four-round match
has a two-knockdown rule.

175
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,708
If Ippo knocks him
down one more time, he wins.

176
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,541
Idiot! Ippo's also taken a fall.

177
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,291
Anyway, whoever scores
a knockdown first, wins.

178
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,166
Ippo, one more push! Bang him up!

179
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,625
There! Go forward and punch each other!

180
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,250
Go for it! There!

181
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,666
Makunouchi, give him another one!

182
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,458
Ozuma's middle is hurting!
Aim for his stomach, his stomach!

183
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:27,041
Damn, the slightest graze
sets my hair on end.

184
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,750
If I took a punch like that, I'd be dead!

185
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:38,833
He's badly damaged,
but his hook is still sharp.

186
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,375
Ozuma's persistence
is as fierce as his hook.

187
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,333
Whoa, my life just got shorter!

188
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,791
They're still going strong!

189
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,041
Whoever scores first will win!

190
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,041
-Go, Ippo!
-Don't lose!

191
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,041
-That's the way, Ozuma!
-Go!

192
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,666
This is exciting.

193
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,375
Knock him down, Ippo!

194
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,291
-Hey! Do it there!
-Just a little more.

195
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,416
Goddammit, I want to fight!

196
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,916
When will they settle
the date of my next match?!

197
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,833
Takamura-san, that has nothing to do
with anything right now.

198
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,208
This is Ippo's match...

199
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,375
Shut up, you!

200
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,041
Hey, that's dirty! He used his shoulder
to push Ippo into the ropes.

201
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,916
Actually, that's a legitimate technique.

202
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,000
Ippo, fight back!

203
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,916
Ozuma is also in pain! Attack him!

204
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,458
<i>Won't he fall yet?!</i>

205
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,833
<i>This is bad. I can't take much more.</i>

206
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,708
<i>I have to finish him now.
Just one more effort!</i>

207
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,291
Idiot! What are you doing?!

208
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,125
You worthless son of a bitch!

209
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,416
I wasted <i>my</i> time coaching you!
What do you have to say for yourself?!

210
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,458
Don't let him get away!
Knock him down all the way!

211
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,583
Ippo took a hit!

212
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,208
He's finally at his limit.

213
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,000
Kid! Now it's do-or-die!

214
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,208
Use every ounce of willpower you got,
and keep those arms punching back!

215
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,458
<i>Damn!</i>

216
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,916
Ippo!

217
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,958
<i>I have to win!
I promised Mama-san and the guys!</i>

218
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,333
<i>I have to win!</i>

219
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,333
Lash out, Ippo!

220
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,958
It's no good. He's trapped!

221
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,208
-Oh, shit!
-Now, Ozuma!

222
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,166
Finish it!

223
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,625
<i>This is the end.</i>

224
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,416
<i>This is the end for you, Makunouchi!</i>

225
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,791
<i>It's a direct hit! Victory is mine!</i>

226
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,416
The winner... Makunouchi!

227
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
He won! What a great reversal!

228
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,916
<i>I... I did it.</i>

229
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,708
He won!

230
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,583
-All right, Ippo!
-Yeah.

231
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,916
Right on!

232
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,291
He finally countered Ozuma's hook.

233
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,083
And it's all thanks to my coaching.

234
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,083
{\an8}ROUND 2 - REMAINING TIME
7 SECONDS

235
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,750
Ippo-kun!

236
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,750
Chief...

237
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,333
Did I...?

238
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,708
That's right, kid. You won.

239
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,125
Slipped through his hook
and delivered an uppercut.

240
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,833
Then you finished him with a barrage

241
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,000
from the right and left,
just as we practiced.

242
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,083
I don't remember it that well, but...

243
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,833
I can't believe it.
I hit him again and again.

244
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,416
I was sure I was done for.

245
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,250
Hey, get over to the other corner
and thank the man.

246
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,291
Uh, right.

247
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,875
So, he doesn't remember.

248
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,500
They say when it comes to the crunch,

249
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,875
the head is useless because
the body already knows what to do.

250
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,666
The intensive training really paid off.

251
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,083
Ozuma! Are you all right?!

252
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,958
Hey... Your ribs!

253
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,875
I see, they were hurt from your fall
from that body blow in the first round.

254
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:39,583
That's why the speed of
your final right hook was slightly slower.

255
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,041
Uh, excuse me...

256
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,708
Um, thank you for the great match.

257
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,416
Please do your best to
become Rookie of the Year.

258
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,458
<i>Ozuma-san...</i>

259
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:10,541
Damn, I can't believe
Ozuma-san could lose!

260
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,500
His opponent was too powerful.

261
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,916
Ippo Makunouchi.

262
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:29,875
Ozuma, that was a great fight!
Don't look so sad!

263
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,916
Come back to Korakuen Hall sometime!

264
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,958
I'll come to see you fight!

265
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,666
Boss...

266
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,916
Ozuma!

267
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,083
The applause for
Ozuma-san is amazing, isn't it?

268
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,208
Yeah. The fans appreciate a good fight.

269
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:05,291
I bet this was his first time
fighting a fighter as tough as Ippo.

270
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,333
It was a good experience for him.

271
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,416
He'll get stronger, for sure.

272
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,708
Who knows what would happen
if it came down to a rematch?

273
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,958
-Come on, let's go.
-Uh, right.

274
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,666
What are you doing?
They all cheered for you.

275
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,791
At least respond by holding up a hand.

276
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,958
You mean, like this?

277
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,041
-Great job, Makunouchi!
-That was exciting!

278
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,458
-Makunouchi!
-Get the Rookie of the Year title!

279
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,166
<i>I won. I actually won.</i>

280
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,458
<i>I survived the first round!</i>

281
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,958
<i>All right!</i>

282
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:54,833
Thank you!

283
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,500
Thank you so much!

284
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,291
Thank you!

285
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Is your chest all right?

286
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,583
No problem.

287
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,500
I'll go see a doctor tomorrow.
I'm all right.

288
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,458
Too bad about the match.

289
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:19,541
Yeah. It's too bad that I lost the match.

290
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,625
But it was a wonderful fight.

291
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,416
I can tell Mama-san
all about it without shame.

292
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,583
Yeah.

293
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,625
That upper to the middle was great!

294
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,875
It sure was awesome!

295
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,875
I'm glad we didn't miss this!

296
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,958
That Makunouchi fight was incredible!

297
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,791
Yeah, he's way past the four-round level!

298
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,208
Huh? You're all here.

299
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,208
Were you waiting for me?

300
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,166
-You should see your face!
-You got hit too much!

301
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,750
Anyway...

302
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,750
Good going, Ippo.

303
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:10,625
