00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,127
Manabu Tamura-kun.

SHOIN HIGH SCHOOL

5
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,216
Same as above.

6
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,718
Congratulations.

7
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,345
Thank you, sir.

SENIOR YEAR GRADUATION CEREMONY

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,351
Satoshi Nishimura-kun.

10
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,855
Same as above.

11
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,025
Congratulations.

12
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,819
Thank you, sir!

13
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,740
Ippo Makunouchi-kun.

14
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,374
Same as above.

15
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,838
Congratulations.

16
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,133
Thank you, sir!

17
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,891
Way to go, our hero!

18
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,186
Makunouchi!

19
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,771
Makunouchi!

20
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,026
-Makunouchi!
-Congratulations!

21
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,195
He certainly is popular.

22
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,948
Apparently his last match
received rave reviews.

23
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:37,907
Yes.

24
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,617
So, he's going to continue boxing

25
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,536
while helping with the family business?

26
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,288
I was concerned for a time

27
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,957
when he chose boxing
over continuing education,

28
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,710
so I gave him a word of advice
at the counseling session.

29
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,044
Really? What did you say?

30
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,799
I said, "You're still young,
so do what you want to do!"

31
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,803
Is that so? He certainly opened my eyes.

32
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,848
College isn't all there is to life,
after all.

33
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:09,814
THE CONTINUING JOURNEY

34
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,951
Well, I'll be getting home now.

35
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,494
I'll come with you.

36
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,079
We have night fishing, right?

37
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,915
I'll be okay by myself.

38
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,750
Your friends are waiting for you.

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,631
At least for today,
forget about home and take it easy.

40
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,883
I will. Thanks, Mom.

41
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,135
Congratulations, Ippo.

42
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,556
Ippo!

43
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,893
Your juniors want a photo with you.

44
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,313
What? I'm not good at stuff like that.

45
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,650
Oh, come on, come on.
They say they're fans of yours.

46
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,487
Fans? So, where are they?

47
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,655
Look behind you.

48
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,156
Yo!

49
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,826
Sir! I saw your last match!

50
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,453
Sir! It deeply moved me!

51
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,330
Sir! It made me weep!

52
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,999
Sir! Please let us have a photo with you!

53
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,835
Eh? Yes. If you would like.

54
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,462
All right, I'm going to take it!

55
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,588
Line up!

56
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,215
Don't drag your feet!

57
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,929
Ready?!

58
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,310
Sir!

59
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,020
I'll root for you twice as hard!

60
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,480
Take the championship.

61
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,731
Sir!

62
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,818
Thank you so much for your support.

63
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,863
Makunouchi-sempai!
Please take a photo with us too.

64
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,823
Me, too!

65
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,283
Makunouchi-sempai!

66
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,826
Please join us for a picture!

67
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,078
Please, All-Japan Rookie of the Year!

68
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,330
Okay, form a single line!

69
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,748
What? You're kidding.

70
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,250
You popular guy, you!

71
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,584
You lucky devil.

72
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,962
What a predicament.

73
00:04:56,045 --> 00:05:01,384
To them, you're the sempai or classmate
they have bragging rights to.

74
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,762
Come on, hero.
Won't you give them a little service?

75
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,097
Service?

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,819
Is that everyone?

77
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,697
Then perhaps I'll get a shot
with him as well...

78
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,825
Hey! The next shot is the last one.

79
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,785
Oh, we have to get in on it, too.

80
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,163
All right, line up!

81
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,080
You're lining up?

82
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,259
So, who's going to take it?

83
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,522
Cheese.

84
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,947
What do you mean, no good at it?

85
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,158
You posed like a bandit at the end.

86
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,953
<i>Still</i>...

87
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,582
<i>He really doesn't look
a thing like the guy in the ring.</i>

88
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,794
<i>Like even I could take him easy.</i>

89
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,318
<i>I was so mean to him.</i>

90
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:52,995
Huh?

91
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,543
-What's wrong?
-Huh? Well, you know...

92
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,088
So, you're a professional boxer.
I'm jealous!

93
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,590
What? Really?

94
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,092
Well, you know, me and the guys

95
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,719
have to start jobs this spring
that we don't even like.

96
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,722
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,600
Hey, don't apologize.

98
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,727
It'll make it harder for us
to do our thing.

99
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,480
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,568
But still, it sure is cool to be
able to keep doing what you like!

101
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,027
Yeah.

102
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,241
Well, I guess this is
where we say goodbye.

103
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,827
Yeah. I'm going this way.

104
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,495
Well, see you later!

105
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,045
Umezawa-kun?

106
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,382
Say...

107
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,508
What is it?

108
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:55,349
Actually, there's something
I have to say to you.

109
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,021
Listen...

110
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,565
I...

111
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,613
<i>Tell him that you're sorry for everything!</i>

112
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,782
<i>Tell him that you think he's amazing!</i>

113
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,622
Oh! Is it about my next match?

114
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,751
My right fist isn't healed yet,
so I don't know when it is yet.

115
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,127
<i>That's not it!</i>

116
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,838
I'll contact you once I know when it is.

117
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,632
<i>That's not it.</i>

118
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,682
I'll be there for sure! You have my word!

119
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,643
Make sure to contact me!

120
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,437
I'll be there to root
for you no matter what!

121
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,024
After all, you're
our shining star of hope!

122
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,945
I can't wait to cheer you on!

123
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,447
Umezawa-kun...

124
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,952
Give it your best, Ippo!
Don't lose to anyone!

125
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,455
<i>Umezawa-kun.</i>

126
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:13,135
<i>They say that Sendo-san
has already resumed training,</i>

127
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,389
<i>and both Ozuma-san and Hayami-san
have made their comebacks with KO's.</i>

128
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,892
<i>Little by little,
they're coming after my position.</i>

129
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,978
<i>I'd love to relax</i>...

130
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,731
<i>but it will probably get harsher
than I can imagine from now on.</i>

131
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,678
I stopped by your house
after my own grad ceremony.

132
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,267
What is it?

133
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,188
Uh, no... Is your foot feeling any better?

134
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,066
You didn't let me see you
when I came to visit.

135
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,154
Um, well, I...

136
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,782
You went to my house?! What for?

137
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,831
I'm going to be leaving Japan for a while,

138
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,041
so I wanted to say bye.

139
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,500
What?

140
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,254
I'm going to be doing
the rounds in Korea and Thailand.

141
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,132
I thought I'd get a look
at the tough guys over there,

142
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,009
and, of course, do some fighting too.

143
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,512
That's amazing! So, how long
will you be there?

144
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,021
The All-Japan Rookie of the Year, huh?

145
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,778
It didn't take long for me
to get so far behind.

146
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,952
I'll be there until I catch up.

147
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,255
<i>I have no time to relax.</i>

148
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,385
<i>I'm going to do it.
I'm going to get to it!</i>

149
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,763
<i>From now on, my life is boxing!</i>

150
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:30,398

<i>Their matches are coming up soon.
I hope everybody wins.</i>

156
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,418
I'm back.

157
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,796
Now, does everybody have one?

158
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,257
You need to have this stamped by tomorrow,

159
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,968
and don't forget your entry fees.

160
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,386
Yes, sir.

161
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,265
There's been a flood
of new applicants lately.

162
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,724
Our gym's fantastic four,

163
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,103
Takamura-kun, Kimura-kun,
Aoki-kun, and you, Ippo-kun,

164
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,896
have been a huge draw.

165
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,900
Thanks to you guys,
we'll be able to order a new sandbag.

166
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,779
<i>So, it's been two years
since I joined the gym.</i>

167
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,907
<i>I'm the most recent applicant
to join and continue boxing,</i>

168
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,203
<i>but this new batch looks hopeful,
and maybe I'll finally get a junior to...</i>

169
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,289
Sorry, but could you move?

170
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,709
Uh, sure.

171
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,170
I always wanted to
try punching one of these.

172
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,759
-Don't poke around.
-Right.

173
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,679
<i>I guess my presence
doesn't command authority.</i>

174
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,348
Ugh, I'm starving!

175
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,933
Count your blessings.

176
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,896
Starvation diets are murder
when you work in a ramen place.

177
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,064
That's the Lightweight Aoki-san!

178
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,025
Kimura-san's with him.

179
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,194
Wow, they're talking about
starvation diets.

180
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,529
Yeah, that's amazing.

181
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,490
They got changed!

182
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,991
Let's watch them for a bit.

183
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,208
It's nonchalant, but that type
of action sure fits the role.

184
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,501
They sure do seem like pros.

185
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,546
Holy cow!

186
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,589
I can't see his hands!

187
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,300
Does that mean Takamura-san
is even faster?

188
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,302
Of course. He's the champion, dummy!

189
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,221
Actually, the new Rookie of the Year,

190
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,805
has incredible punches.

191
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,518
I came to this gym because
I want to be just like Makunouchi-san.

192
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,811
The Rookie Championship
got me totally wired!

193
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,023
When it comes to destructive power,
Takamura-san is superior.

194
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,816
They're in a different weight class.

195
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,318
I know that!

196
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,320
Damn, they're noisy.

197
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,074
Hey, so you <i>are</i> here, Ippo!

198
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,325
Huh?

199
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,079
You were right beside me
and I never even noticed?!

200
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,081
I thought you were a newbie like us!

201
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,626
You look like another person in the ring.

202
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,173
It's Takamura-san!

203
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,008
In the flesh! Is this for real?!

204
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,343
He's so dignified!

205
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,804
I wonder if I can get his autograph?

206
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,245
Keep the noise down,
you annoying chatterboxes!

207
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,663
Uh, Takamura-san!

208
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,707
Chill!

209
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,252
Don't get anywhere near this guy
when he's dieting!

210
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,047
Go home! You can't be a pro
if you drool around

211
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,258
like girly groupies
waiting for an autograph!

212
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,053
I'm serious, you know.
I have a lot of confidence in myself.

213
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,347
And my endurance is second to none!

214
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,265
Yeah!

215
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,517
Then why don't we put that to the test?

216
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,228
It's quite simple.
We're merely going to see

217
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,648
if you can keep up with
the amount of roadwork we normally do.

218
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,943
I know I'm the next champion,
but I would be thrilled.

219
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,362
-Oh?
-This sounds like fun.

220
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,780
Shall we get this started?

221
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,365
{\an8}All right, follow me!

222
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,283
{\an8}Yes, sir!

223
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,454
Is it okay to start
with that out of nowhere?

224
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,790
Humph. It'll do them good to have
a taste of severity right off the bat.

225
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,377
It will thin out the losers,
leaving only those with guts.

226
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,295
But still...

227
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,213
I'll supervise them.

228
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,893
Yikes.

229
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,315
<i>Those guys never cut any slack.</i>

230
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,376
Hey, are you okay?

231
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,131
You should rest a little.

232
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,929
Hey, come on. You have to rest!

233
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,391
It's not an actual test, so don't worry.

234
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,892
You're free to join,

235
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,436
and you can slowly
get used to doing roadwork.

236
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,480
Take a deep breath.

237
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,821
Well, once you feel better,
try to catch up.

238
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,575
<i>I'm used to it, so I'm numb,</i>

239
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,453
<i>but the world of boxing is really tough.</i>

240
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,508
Only one?!

241
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,468
Humph! They were all mouth.

242
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,013
But I didn't get their entry fees yet!

243
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,514
What the heck, right?

244
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,767
Guys without the guts
wouldn't last long anyway.

245
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,519
Where are you going?

246
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,606
Uh, I... have to be getting home.

247
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,525
I'll come back tomorrow.

248
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,530
Think he'll come back?

249
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,032
He won't be back.

250
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,577
And I was going to
make a fighter out of him, too.

251
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,536
What's up, Ippo?

252
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,122
It's just that I was looking forward

253
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,250
to getting lots of juniors to coach.

254
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,544
Sorry to hear it.

255
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,257
Look at that, Ippo. One's coming this way.

256
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,550
Good show!

257
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,844
He's got a lot of gumption.

258
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,555
Undoubtedly, he wants to join the gym
because of my influence.

259
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,058
Okay, I think I'll take a look at the guy.

260
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,185
No. I'll make a boxer out of him.

261
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,728
What are you talking about?!

262
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,563
He came to this gym to be like me!

263
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,814
I'll look after him!

264
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,986
Now, dive...

265
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,573
...into my waiting arms!

266
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,040
Well, got to go practice.

267
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,834
But you can't! He ran the whole course!

268
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,420
Okay, so you look after him.

269
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,089
We're busy.

270
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,091
For crying out loud!

271
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,176
You did a great job.

272
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,141
Looks like he got himself a great junior.

273
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,601
Yeah.

274
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,982
{\an8}-Is Barf-michi still in the shower?
-Barf-michi?

275
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:33,904
{\an8}His name is Naomichi Yamada.
He's 16, high school second year!

276
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,864
{\an8}He's a barfing Naomichi, so "Barf-michi."

277
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,033
Good name, right?

278
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,369
Sure.

279
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,413
No sports experience, huh?

280
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,250
With that height, he's a welterweight.
We can get more out of him.

281
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:50,003
I'll leave a change of clothes here,
along with the stuff in your pockets.

282
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,006
Is this a pass holder?

283
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,261
-Hey, what's up with you?!
-What's up?

284
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,598
Aha, so he's hiding something!

285
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,225
Is it a picture of a girl?

286
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,935
Without further ado...

287
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,696
I see. Barf-michi is an Ippo fan.

288
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,656
I envy you, Ippo.

289
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:23,287
{\an8}KOURAKUEN HALL

290
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,040
<i>When the main event features
Takamura-san, it sure gets packed.</i>

291
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,043
HISHOU JAPAN MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMP MAMORU
TAKAMURA VS THAILAND #2 BONCHAI CHUWATANA

292
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,462
<i>Do your best.</i>

293
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,799
<i>I hope all three of you win.</i>

294
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,721
So you're here to cheer them on too,
Yamada-kun?

295
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,556
What a coincidence to meet like this.

296
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,684
What? It's not a coincidence?

297
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,562
I thought you would come here,
so I watched for you.

298
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,064
Since morning?

299
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,986
-How are you feeling?
-Great.

300
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,072
You'll see! We'll all score by KO.

301
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,159
What's that skulking behind you?

302
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,579
Uh, well, Yamada-kun also
wanted to offer some encouragement.

303
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,830
Go on.

304
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,833
Go on, encourage them!

305
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:13,837
Give...

306
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,674
it...

307
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,137
your...

308
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,181
best.

309
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,896
Well, do your best!

310
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,777
That's no good.
You have to encourage them properly.

311
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,278
They're all nervous right now.

312
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,571
Yeah.

313
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,531
Oh, well.

314
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,077
Anyway, Yamada-kun,
this is your first time backstage, right?

315
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,286
Uh, yes.

316
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,874
Once you walk through this corridor
and up those stairs,

317
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,626
you're in the stadium.

318
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:56,296
When you go through here,
it's so nerve-wracking.

319
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,259
Do you see the blotches here and there?
Can you tell what they're from?

320
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,802
No.

321
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,263
They're glove marks.

322
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,807
Once you've made it this far,
there's no going back.

323
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:11,144
You tell yourself over
and over to calm down.

324
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,313
With little thumps, like this.

325
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:19,236
But you don't have
to be nervous right now!

326
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,864
-Oh, Ippo-kun.
-Fujii-san!

327
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,659
The Kamogawa Gym
has a busy day ahead of them, huh?

328
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,369
I'm sure everyone will win.

329
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,831
I see. Oh, I'm glad I ran into you.

330
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,833
I'll introduce you to my surprise guest.

331
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,128
I don't need an introduction.

332
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,632
How's your right fist, Makunouchi-kun?

333
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,136
You know about me?

334
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,639
You're the hopeful who's
been blowing away the competition.

335
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,141
Of course I know about you.

336
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,685
Ippo-kun, this is...

337
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,395
I know.

338
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,275
<i>How could I not know?</i>

339
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,945
<i>This is the Featherweight Champion
of Japan...</i>

340
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,323

<i>A peak that only one person can stand on.</i>

00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,287
<i>Faster than anyone.</i>

346
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,789
<i>More skilled than anyone.</i>

347
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,915
<i>Stronger than anyone.</i>

348
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,669
<i>It is unimaginable to fight such a person.</i>

349
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,964
<i>But an actual meeting
with such a person in the ring</i>

350
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,091
<i>is no longer so far in the distant future!</i>

351

<i>Next time, "The Champ and I."</i>
