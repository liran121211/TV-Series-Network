ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,958
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,791
<i>I got a body blow!</i>

4
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,291
<i>What?!</i>

5
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,333
<i>Right!</i>

6
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:37,541
There it is! Makunouchi's power blow
that sends them flying, guard and all!

7
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,875
All right! We have control of the pace!
Whale into him!

8
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,791
<i>His punches aren't as powerful
as Sendo-san's!</i>

9
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,916
<i>I'll go forward prepared
to take a few hits!</i>

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,166
<i>Don't pull back.</i>

11
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:00,791
Oh, my! This time Makunouchi's guard
is blown away!

12
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,916
Okita hammers an intense right straight!

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,166
<i>This punch!</i>

14
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,458
<i>It's a corkscrew! Just like Date-san's!</i>

15
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,875
TWO ROOKIES OF THE YEAR

16
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,625
The fighters have backed off
from their ferocious battle.

17
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,416
Now, how will they act?
Who will make the first move?

18
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,041
<i>It's the same pose as Date-san too.</i>

19
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,375
<i>Will he use his right,
or will he use his left?</i>

20
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,500
<i>The pose makes it hard to tell.</i>

21
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,500
<i>Left! No, right!</i>

22
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:43,250
<i>Which is it? Which will he use?</i>

23
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,458
<i>Left! Oh, no!</i>

24
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,250
<i>A feint?! I dropped my opposite guard!</i>

25
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:49,833
<i>Another feint!</i>

26
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,916
<i>This time, it's...</i>

27
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,583
<i>A body blow.</i>

28
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,958
<i>He pretended to throw high and aimed low!</i>

29
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,166
<i>Damn!</i>

30
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,708
<i>He's doing it again.</i>

31
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,083
<i>Which is he going to use? Which?!</i>

32
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,458
Damn! He made a punch
look like a corkscrew and showed their

33
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,416
difference in careers in one shot.

34
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,041
Ippo's rhythm has been shattered.

35
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,041
He's good at keeping distance.

36
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,583
Okita's actual match skill
is greater than I imagined.

37
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,000
Hey, they've gotten quiet.

38
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,291
What happened to their energy?

39
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,250
This isn't an arranged marriage!

40
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,833
Go at it harder, would you?!

41
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,958
Fight!

42
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,666
<i>That's easy for you to say.</i>

43
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,041
Kid!

44
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,041
Don't wait for him to punch!

45
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,791
Remember your own boxing!

46
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,750
<i>He's right. I have to box my way!</i>

47
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,291
<i>I have to weave past his jabs
and get on the inside!</i>

48
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,791
<i>He's going to attack.</i>

49
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,125
<i>Left!</i>

50
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,833
<i>No, right!</i>

51
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,833
<i>I got it backwards again.</i>

52
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,125
<i>I can't tell them apart!</i>

53
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,083
Whoops! Okita's jabs are hitting
their mark quite well!

54
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,666
Makunouchi tries to charge in,
but he can't get near!

55
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,416
What's wrong with Ippo-kun today?

56
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,916
He can't find a venue!

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,375
His boxing consists of diving in

58
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,916
and weaving through
the opponent's punches,

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,416
but he can't see where
those punches are coming from.

60
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,708
Idiot! Don't get fooled by simple feints!

61
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,083
Pull back for now! Keep a distance!

62
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,833
Stupid, that's just what Okita wants.

63
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,875
If he backs off even slightly,
he'll be run back into the rope.

64
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,541
Okita will aim for the rope-side punch
he planned for.

65
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,416
A corkscrew?!

66
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,666
I take back what I just said!
Ippo, don't back off no matter what!

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,958
I don't care if you have to force it!
Just go forward!

68
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,666
Okita's aiming for the moment
you back off!

69
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,208
Makunouchi's face is
starting to change shape.

70
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,375
If you take that many jabs,
it'll have an effect.

71
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,875
Is he going to make a KO?!

72
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,125
<i>I'll finish this!</i>

73
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,458
Don't flinch, Ippo!

74
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,375
Get out there!

75
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,625
Kid! Don't back down!

76
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,000
<i>He pulled back!</i>

77
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:39,750
You fool! You lost sight of
your own boxing style!

78
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,125
Ah, Makunouchi is running!

79
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,541
He is cornered in one attack!
His back is to the wall!

80
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,708
I told you <i>not</i> to back up, you moron!

81
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,291
Get out of there quick!

82
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:07,958
<i>See that? My boxing is Date-san's boxing.</i>

83
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,208
<i>I've made countless simulations</i>

84
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,541
<i>of what Date-san would do
in a situation like this.</i>

85
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,375
<i>I'm fighting this match in his mindset.</i>

86
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,666
<i>If you think you can take him on
when you can't even beat me,</i>

87
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,958
<i>you're ten years...</i>

88
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,708
<i>too premature!</i>

89
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,125
<i>Got you!</i>

90
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,791
No! It's a corkscrew!

91
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,666
<i>Hey, was he waiting for my corkscrew?</i>

92
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,250
This is explosive!
Makunouchi throws a right uppercut!

93
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,083
The punches keep coming!

94
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:59,000
Whoops! Makunouchi is also hurting!
Okita also roundhouses!

95
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,416
Makunouchi, left! Okita returns the favor!

96
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,625
It probably hurts to move,
but they don't stop!

97
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,875
Whoa, he returns the body blow!

98
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,375
Okita is down!

99
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,125
He's down! Back to your neutral corner!

100
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,291
A reverse development
in the blink of an eye!

101
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,875
He felled him by force!

102
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,125
That's this year's Rookie of
the Year for you! Ippo Makunouchi!

103
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,166
All right! This is
what we came here to see!

104
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,500
That punch is inhuman!

105
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,791
It sent shivers up my spine!

106
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,875
Huh, he fooled us.

107
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,833
The bastard was aiming for that.

108
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,208
He aimed for that?

109
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,291
A venue of attack.

110
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,375
He doesn't know what's coming next,
so Ippo thought hard.

111
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,750
He forgot his own
forward-attacking style of boxing.

112
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,916
<i>So he decided to wager on the punch
he knew was coming,</i>

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,625
<i>the corkscrew.</i>

114
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,875
<i>The idea was to force
a venue of attack from there.</i>

115
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,375
That makes sense.

116
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:08,583
He backed off without provocation
in order to coax out a corkscrew.

117
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,791
No, it's not nearly that cool.

118
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,708
It means he was driven so far
into a corner,

119
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,750
that he took a gamble out of desperation.

120
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,041
Still, Okita sure fell for it.

121
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,708
He pulled off
a different pattern of boxing

122
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,791
than anything he's ever done before.

123
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,333
<i>There was an impact.</i>

124
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,041
<i>Don't get up!</i>

125
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,750
Okita makes a response.
Will he get up? Can he get up?!

126
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,250
<i>Get up!</i>

127
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:41,083
<i>My boxing... is Date-san's boxing!</i>

128
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,375
<i>If I lose,</i>

129
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:48,166
<i>it will make Date-san's boxing
look bad as well!</i>

130
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,541
<i>I... I can't lose!</i>

131
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,541
Okita's almost there!
Will he make it to his feet?!

132
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,541
I can go on!

133
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,250
Okita is up! He's on his feet!

134
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,291
He takes a fighting pose!

135
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,250
Ippo! Don't show him any sympathy!

136
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,750
Finish him off!

137
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,125
If you win, you'll get 5th ranking!

138
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,416
You'll be within firing range of doing
what you want - challenging the champ!

139
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,916
<i>Within firing range!</i>

140
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,125
{\an8}Now, 30 seconds remain in round one.

141
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,541
{\an8}Will Okita weather it out?!

142
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,541
{\an8}Will Makunouchi put
his opportunity to good use?

143
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:46,583
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

144
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,958
If you win, you'll get 5th ranking!

145
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,208
You'll be within firing range of doing
what you want - challenging the champ!

146
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,958
<i>Within firing range!</i>

147
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,583
{\an8}Now, 30 seconds remain in round one.

148
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,916
{\an8}Will Okita weather it out?!

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,708
{\an8}Will Makunouchi put
his opportunity to good use?

150
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,250
The match continues!

151
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,333
Makunouchi attacks with vigor!
How will Okita evade him?

152
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,833
Or will he be defeated in the face
of Makunouchi's destructive power?!

153
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,708
<i>I must win. I must win
so I can challenge Date-san!</i>

154
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,333
<i>He's strong. This guy is strong, Date-san!</i>

155
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,625
<i>I must win!</i>

156
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,416
<i>Damn it!</i>

157
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,125
<i>I... I can't afford to lose!</i>

158
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,666
<i>I have to win to challenge Date-san!</i>

159
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,833
<i>I always looked up to him!</i>

160
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,916
<i>I'm going to be the one
who catches up to him!</i>

161
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,916
Both boxers move in at the same time!

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,416
How's this?!

163
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,916
Makunouchi's left
is a split-second faster!

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,875
Whoa, he took it head-on!

165
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:05,916
He's a goner!

166
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,916
<i>I connected!</i>

167
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,583
<i>He's powerful...</i>

168
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,666
<i>I can't hold on...</i>

169
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,833
<i>anymore.</i>

170
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,541
Way to go, Rookie of the Year!

171
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,208
Oh, Date-san!

172
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,541
You really have gotten tougher.

173
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,000
Not really.

174
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,416
I just learned to copycat you better,
that's all.

175
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,666
You idiot.

176
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,916
You have other textbooks
to rely on than me, right?

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,291
Like Leonard and Hagler.

178
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,666
No, thank you.

179
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,916
I like your boxing best.

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,166
Really? Well, do as you will!

181
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:57,916
<i>I look up to you. I want to be like you.</i>

182
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,166
<i>Like you, Date-san.</i>

183
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,083
He withstood the blow! I'm surprised!

184
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,583
Okita took Makunouchi's
power blow full-on!

185
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,708
However, he props himself
on the rope, refusing to fall!

186
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,250
<i>If I fell, I wouldn't
be able to get up again.</i>

187
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:26,083
<i>It was a really solid impact too.
What incredible willpower!</i>

188
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,833
The most astounded person here
has to be this man-Makunouchi!

189
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,583
Until a moment ago,
he most likely thought victory was his!

190
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:36,250
<i>Willpower? No, it's tenacity.</i>

191
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,833
<i>This guy is different from anyone
you've dealt with so far.</i>

192
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,125
<i>There's tenacity that comes
from the unwillingness to</i>

193
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,875
<i>relinquish a position you fought for.</i>

194
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,583
<i>The higher you go,
the stronger that tenacity becomes.</i>

195
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:52,125
Go, kid! If you don't take advantage
of this opportunity,

196
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,541
you can't go for the top!

197
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,791
Pin down Okita, tenacity and all!

198
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,875
<i>If I don't use this chance...</i>

199
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,458
<i>I can't aim high!</i>

200
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,583
<i>He's going to attack!</i>

201
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:06,458
<i>Calm down, Okita.
This is the time you need to be calm.</i>

202
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,958
<i>I'm feeling the pain,
but I still have strength in me!</i>

203
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,208
<i>That's it. Good.</i>

204
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,208
<i>If he's going to attack me straight-on,
that's what I have to aim for!</i>

205
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,000
<i>Makunouchi's final move
is well established.</i>

206
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,958
<i>However, it's direct.</i>

207
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,208
-<i>There will only be...
-...One chance.</i>

208
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:37,208
Ah! Makunouchi strikes!
Will this lead to the finish?!

209
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,458
<i>If I go now, I can go all the way!</i>

210
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:43,208
<i>If I beat Okita-san, I'll be ranked 5th.
I'll be closer to Date-san.</i>

211
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,458
<i>To the champion!</i>

212
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,000
<i>Left!</i>

213
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,458
<i>His right guard is wide open!</i>

214
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,791
<i>He fell for it!</i>

215
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,166
<i>The left was a feint to bring
Makunouchi around to the right.</i>

216
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,208
<i>Okita's aiming for...</i>

217
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,208
<i>The corkscrew!</i>

218
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,208
<i>My guard! It's no good.
I'll have to shake it off!</i>

219
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,708
<i>It's bang-on!</i>

220
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,583
That bastard! He rigged a fiendish trap
at the last possible moment!

221
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,583
It's a corkscrew counter!

222
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,583
<i>Got you!</i>

223
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,333
<i>Okita's is faster!</i>

224
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:41,791
My God! Makunouchi's right straight
scored as a counterpunch!

225
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,458
Okita has been flung off!
This is his second knockdown!

226
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,791
He made it there first.

227
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,750
<i>His timing was perfect.</i>

228
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,791
<i>But he took on too much damage
to move his legs.</i>

229
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,291
<i>That was close.</i>

230
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,208
<i>Okita-san lost control of his legs,</i>

231
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,291
<i>making him miss his mark.</i>

232
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,166
Now, the countdown begins!

233
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,916
Will Okita be able to show
the same perseverance as before?!

234
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,625
<i>He was in such bad shape
he was barely able to stand,</i>

235
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,208
<i>but he still came up
with that calm, calculated plan.</i>

236
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,416
<i>What a guy!</i>

237
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,083
Okita doesn't move!

238
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,291
Is it hopeless this time? Is it hopeless?!

239
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,333
Okita, keep going!

240
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,916
Get up, Okita! Show us
what you're made of one more time!

241
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,041
Whoa, there's movement from Okita!

242
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,375
<i>Stay down!</i>

243
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,375
Okita...

244
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,208
Okita!

245
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,458
<i>Date... san.</i>

246
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,958
<i>Date-san, I...</i>

247
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,208
<i>I failed...</i>

248
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,208
<i>to be you.</i>

249
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,000
The match is over!

250
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:41,250
Okita is unable to continue!
Ippo Makunouchi wins!

251
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,583
Sempai!

252
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,083
He pulled it off!

253
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,500
Yahoo!

254
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,500
I... I did it.

255
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,000
I did it!

256
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:56,125
Oops, this is unusual!
Makunouchi strikes a victory pose!

257
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,125
It was only one round of combat,

258
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,708
but his pose speaks for itself!

259
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,041
It was a difficult victory!

260
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,750
The nonstop KO expressway -
the fists that rule the ring

261
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,041
are raised high in triumph!

262
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,125
You did it, Ippo-kun!

263
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,750
Thank you, sir!

264
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,916
Uh, Chief...

265
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,500
You don't make the face
of a victor every time around.

266
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,875
However, you took down a fifth-ranker.

267
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,250
I guess it's to be expected.

268
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,708
Thank you, sir.

269
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,375
Uh, thanks.

270
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,250
You got me.

271
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,666
Uh, Okita-san...

272
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,500
Date-san is nothing like me, got it?

273
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,500
Thank you for the match!

274
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,791
Okita, you did a great job
hanging in there!

275
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,541
I want to see you here again sometime!

276
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,083
I have to start over.

277
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,958
I'm still a long way from where you are.

278
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,625
I see.

279
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,250
<i>You lost because you can't catch up to me?</i>

280
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,958
<i>That's not true.</i>

281
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,541
<i>The difference in his attitude as
a challenger showed in the final result.</i>

282
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,750
<i>You'll realize that soon enough.</i>

283
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,750
<i>There are those who try to catch up,
and those who try to overtake.</i>

284
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,750
<i>Makunouchi showed the difference
of those two.</i>

285
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,250
<i>Overtake, huh?</i>

286
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:03,250
KO TIME: 1R, 2 MINUTES, 58 SECONDS
IPPO MAKUNOUCHI 8 FIGHTS, 8 WINS, 8 KOS

287
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,375
Congratulations, Makunouchi-kun.
That was a great fight!

288
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,875
Now your ranking went up. How do you feel?

289
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,791
Uh, I only just finished the match,

290
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,541
so I don't know how to feel yet.

291
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,708
All right, interview's over!

292
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,708
-What?!
-You're kidding!

293
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,625
Oh, no! It's already started!

294
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,500
Takamura-san, what's happening now?

295
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,500
The challenger, Suzuki, fell down twice.
He's a goner.

296
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,875
Twice? But it just started, didn't it?!

297
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,916
The old guy is really hyped up tonight.

298
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,125
He's surprisingly strong.

299
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,458
Oh! The champion connects
with a right punch!

300
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,000
Suzuki lapses into defensive mode!
How will he survive?!

301
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,250
Now Suzuki charges forward with tenacity!

302
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,000
A right from the champion!

303
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,250
What's wrong, Suzuki? You're not moving!

304
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,000
<i>Heartbreak shot.</i>

305
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,041
He throws a left!

306
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,625
Three knockdowns! The match is over!

307
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:26,541
The champion flatly denies
the 2nd-rank challenger his position!

308
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,041
His strength is that of a titan!

309
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,208
He's strong.

310
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,250
He would have fallen
no problem from the left alone,

311
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,625
but he threw in a right for good measure.

312
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,208
Not only that,
they were all corkscrew blows.

313
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,250
Are you really going to
take on that monster?

314
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,500
Aw, well. I hope you don't die.

315
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,333
That's not that funny.

316
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,375
<i>Still</i>...

317
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,291
<i>He really is on a totally different level.</i>

318
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,416
And now for an interview with the victor.

319
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,625
Champion, congratulations.

320
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,041
You seemed to win with ease.

321
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,208
There's talk of you returning
the title within the year

322
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,583
and re-challenging the world title.

323
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,500
Has this paved the way to that objective?

324
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,625
Yeah! Go for the world! The world!

325
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,958
Go take the world belt!

326
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,125
We're counting on you!

327
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,375
I will not return the title.

328
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:21,041
I still have some unfinished business
within the country.

329
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,541
I will settle that first.

330
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,541
The world can wait until afterwards!

331
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,541
Huh?

332
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,291
Takamura-san, he's looking this way.

333
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,375
He's looking at you, stupid!

334
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,958
It looks like
his unfinished business is <i>you</i>.

335
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,250
The old guy's totally
in the mood to fight.

336
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,750
Um, Ch... Champion?

337
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,875
Don't look away! Give him the evil eye!

338
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,125
<i>For all his hesitation,
he's ready to rumble.</i>
