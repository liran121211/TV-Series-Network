ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,666
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,625
{\an8}KOURAKUEN HALL

4
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,583
Whoa! The champion's
spectacular counterpunch!

5
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:42,208
{\an8}The invincible challenger's knee
has finally touched the floor!

6
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:45,416
In the 9th pro match,
it's the first, humiliating down!

7
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,541
I can't believe
Takamura-san allowed a down.

8
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:54,250
A feint usually never tricks you!
You <i>are</i> under a lot of pressure!

9
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,208
<i>Damn it!</i>

10
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:59,583
{\an8}Yajima!

11
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,833
No! I don't want you to lose!

12
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,750
Yajima!

13
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,708
Stand up, Takamura-san!

14
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,208
I don't want you to lose!

15
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,291
<i>Lose? Did you say I lose...?!</i>

16
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,791
Please stand up, Takamura-san!

17
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,750
If you don't become a champion,

18
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,291
we're not gonna have any dreams or hopes!

19
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,375
Hooray! Takamura!

20
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,083
Don't lose, Takamura!

21
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,083
Takamura!

22
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,583
Hey, what's that frantic cheering for?

23
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:42,000
Do you guys even think I might lose?

24
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:46,333
You idiots!

25
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,958
He stood up!

26
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,708
Takamura-san!

27
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:59,708
THE THREAT OF A SHOTGUN

28
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,458
All right!

29
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,333
{\an8}Whoa! He stood up! He did stand up!

30
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,708
Takamura stood up at the count of eight!

31
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,166
However, he still seems to
be suffering from the damage.

32
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,458
Will Yajima finish him off now?

33
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,875
Don't step backward!
The champion is a straight puncher!

34
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,333
The match resumed,
and the champion's barrage started!

35
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,958
<i>Yajima's punches are
going toward Takamura's face</i>

36
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,833
<i>because he's so focused on scoring a KO.</i>

37
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,916
<i>Is Takamura provoking him?</i>

38
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,041
It's mine!

39
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,000
It connected!

40
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,791
I'm not gonna let you get away!

41
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:52,583
The challenger is already fully recovered
from the down earlier.

42
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:56,500
Takamura's continuous punches are
pushing the champion against the rope!

43
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,250
Left and right! Left!

44
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,708
Amazing power!

45
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,875
With each punch,
the rope bites into the champion's back!

46
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,083
But the champion's guard is solid, too!

47
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,916
Damn it! I'll pry it open!

48
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,000
Eat this!

49
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,250
You idiot!

50
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,750
Did you forget that you received
a counterpunch to that?

51
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,000
It's dangerous!

52
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't receive the same punch repeatedly!

53
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,875
<i>Such a stupid down.</i>

54
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,375
<i>You humiliated me in public!</i>

55
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,375
Never dream of getting
away without consequences!

56
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,791
Stop, Takamura!

57
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,333
The challenger Takamura's
deadly punches exploded!

58
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,333
Will the champion be able to stand up?

59
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,875
YAJIMA

60
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,166
Huh? He is not counting.

61
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,083
Ah! He stopped the match!
The match is over!

62
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:16,083
The new champion is born!

63
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,166
{\an8}Great! Takamura!

64
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,833
{\an8}All right! Way to go!

65
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,583
Takamura!

66
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,500
Chief, he did it! He's the champion!

67
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,583
Right!

68
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,541
Way to go!

69
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,916
Mamoru Takamura... once again,
he scored a KO in the first round!

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,708
In a mere 90 seconds, he successfully
took the championship title!

71
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:41,250
{\an8}And now, the championship belt is
placed around the new champion's body!

72
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,666
Awesome! Takamura!

73
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,875
-Great job, Takamura!
-You're the best!

74
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,208
You're way too strong!

75
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,666
Number One!

76
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,208
Awesome!

77
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,458
<i>He's way too cool.</i>

78
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,375
Ah, the celebration party
was really successful too.

79
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,208
I've never seen Chief so happy!

80
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:17,625
CELEBRATING MAMORU TAKAMURA'S
JAPAN MIDDLEWEIGHT TITLE

81
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,000
With just a Japanese title
he was so excited.

82
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,750
When I get the world champion title,
he might have a heart attack.

83
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,791
<i>The world, huh?</i>

84
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,791
<i>He really talks big.</i>

85
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,916
See you later then!

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,041
Yes! Good night!

87
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,541
Are you all right?

88
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,583
Don't make a fuss. It's not a big deal.

89
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,083
It's what they call
"Punch-Drunk Syndrome" after a match.

90
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,666
Because I received
a clean hit today after all.

91
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,083
Humph! You need to hurry home too.

92
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,666
Go to bed and recover.

93
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,458
<i>That's right.</i>

94
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,916
<i>Since it was such a spectacular KO,
I almost forgot.</i>

95
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:19,250
<i>Takamura-san didn't win
the championship belt easily.</i>

96
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:24,833
<i>It was the first time</i>

97
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,583
<i>I felt the damage in my legs.</i>

98
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,666
<i>I got headstrong and got up,
but what motivated me was</i>...

99
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,666
Stand up! Takamura-san!

100
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,958
I don't want you to lose!

101
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,041
Hey, Ippo!

102
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:43,916
Yes!

103
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,333
Thank you.

104
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,333
Huh? What did you say?

105
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,541
Ugh! Well... um...

106
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,041
Huh?

107
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,416
Don't you dare lose the next match!

108
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,875
Uh... yes!

109
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,416
But the next opponent is Hayami-kun,
so it's gonna be tough.

110
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,416
You dummy! I don't know
if he's a prodigy or what!

111
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,916
But this is my order.
You have to win, no matter what!

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,166
Understand?!

113
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,916
Yes, sir! I'll do my best!

114
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,125
Win the Rookie of the Year!

115
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,000
Yes, sir! I'll do my best!

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,916
Hey, Ippo!

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,916
I saw your match the other day.

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,875
You made us really nervous.

119
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,166
You had only two seconds left.
Two seconds!

120
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,208
So, when is your next match?

121
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,333
The next match is a semi-final
of the Rookie Tournament.

122
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,791
So, in a month or so.

123
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:58,791
Who's the opponent?

124
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,250
It's not decided yet, but it's most likely

125
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,083
that Hayami-san from the first seed

126
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,875
should be making it to the semi-final.

127
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,958
Let's see. Ha... ya... mi.

128
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,166
Uh... Umezawa-san. You spelled it wrong.

129
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,166
It says "seed brother one."

130
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,375
Here's Umezawa punch!

131
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,166
You have a conference
with your teacher today, don't you?

132
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,916
-What are you gonna do after graduation?
-Um, I'm not sure.

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,083
Think about it seriously,
because you're smart, unlike Umezawa-san.

134
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,208
Another Umezawa punch!

135
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,166
{\an8}SHOIN HIGH SCHOOL

136
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,833
GUIDANCE COUNSELING ROOM

137
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,250
-What? Boxing?
-Uh... yes...

138
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,166
While helping my family business,
fishing boat rental, though.

139
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,708
Makunouchi, that's disappointing.

140
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,083
What?

141
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,583
With your grades,
you're well qualified to go to college.

142
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,666
It's not too late.

143
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,708
Don't you want to
apply for a couple of them?

144
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,916
But...

145
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,500
Listen, Makunouchi.

146
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,000
Have more confidence in yourself.

147
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,541
Going to college will
certainly benefit you in the future.

148
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,916
I... I am taking boxing very seriously!

149
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,750
I am in the middle of
the rookie championship right now

150
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,916
and my next opponent is extremely strong!

151
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,041
But...

152
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,916
I can't afford to lose!

153
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,083
No matter what...

154
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,708
No matter what... I can't
just drop out halfway through!

155
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,458
All right, Makunouchi.

156
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:38,833
I won't say anything more because
you seem to be firm in your determination.

157
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,000
So, do your best!

158
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,416
But, Makunouchi, if you
ever change your mind,

159
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,166
come talk to me anytime.

160
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,666
I'll be happy to do
whatever I can to help you out.

161
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,333
Yes, sir! Thank you so much!

162
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,166
Now, excuse me!

163
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,916
<i>That quiet and shy Makunouchi</i>...

164
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,041
<i>I guess how they appear is
different from how they really are.</i>

165
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,375
Ah! I forgot my bag!

166
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,333
Sorry! I left my bag.

167
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,708
Sorry to have interrupted.

168
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,416
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

169
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,458
<i>I'm convinced that my next opponent
will be Hayami-san.</i>

170
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,625
<i>He is far from easy to defeat.</i>

171
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,791
<i>He is the strongest so far.</i>

172
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,041
Kobashi-san!

173
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,958
Hi, there.

174
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,333
I saw you from up there.

175
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,583
You looked like you were worrying.

176
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,541
What?

177
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,666
I totally understand,
because the next one is Hayami-san.

178
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:25,750
I'm embarrassed to say this,
but I was planning on defeating you,

179
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,458
so I also studied Hayami-san.

180
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,125
Of course, in order to defeat him as well.

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,958
But...

182
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,958
He has no blind spots.

183
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,916
He is extremely strong... amazingly.

184
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,458
Even you can't come up with tactics,
Kobashi-san?

185
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,458
But... You might have a chance to win.

186
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,333
With your style of boxing,

187
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,125
that never gives up until the end,

188
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,458
you will definitely find a breakthrough.

189
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,916
Above all, you have a fatal punch
that could knock anyone out!

190
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,958
My nose knows that.

191
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,125
What?

192
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,500
Well, it broke.

193
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,583
I thought I put up a good guard,
but still, your punch was awesome.

194
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,125
Back then?

195
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,166
I am terribly sorry!

196
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,583
Please don't apologize for it.

197
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:31,666
When you keep winning,
we can be proud as well.

198
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,750
And the wounds will become our medal.

199
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,291
No one is happy to lose.

200
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,000
That's all the more reason
I want you to win next.

201
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,416
Your fists will be carrying our hearts.

202
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,291
Give all you've got.

203
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,916
<i>Promise me! You'll become
the Rookie Champion!</i>

204
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,333
<i>Please do your best to
become Rookie of the Year.</i>

205
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,291
<i>Kobashi-san... Ozuma-san...</i>

206
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,875
<i>I have to give all I've got,
for their sake too.</i>

207
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,291
{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,958
I gathered all of Hayami's match videos
after he turned pro.

209
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,291
He fought an in-fighter just once,

210
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,291
an onrush-style bull fighter
just like you.

211
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,083
Watch it pretending
that you are the one fighting him!

212
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,916
As expected, his guard is solid.

213
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,166
After this, Hayami's gonna shoot one-two.

214
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,666
What would you do?

215
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,791
If it was me...

216
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,666
I'll block the jab on one,
and weave under the straight punch

217
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,416
on two and try to go deep inside.

218
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,916
Right on! Use a hook there!

219
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,500
<i>So, would you say
it was an easy victory today?</i>

220
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:23,083
<i>Well, I should say that I was lucky
to have an in-fighter as my opponent.</i>

221
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,708
<i>Meaning?</i>

222
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:28,333
<i>I've never failed to
bring down an in-fighter.</i>

223
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,500
What he's saying is not a bluff.

224
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,583
Ever since his amateur days,
Hayami has KO'd in-fighters

225
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,583
with a 100% success rate.

226
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:41,000
He has an incredible barrage of
middle-range punches called "shotgun."

227
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,500
When you try to go deep inside,

228
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,458
he'll greet you with
that sharp "short uppercut."

229
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,083
That's why he makes
a sucker of in-fighters so easily.

230
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,625
Then my current tactics
won't be effective.

231
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,541
Right, as you just witnessed.

232
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:59,041
So, we'll improve your defense.

233
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,333
Move your body with the image
of Hayami in your mind constantly.

234
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,041
You have to make every shot
of his shotgun a swish in the air!

235
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,500
If you do succeed,

236
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,708
he will have exhausted
a considerable amount of stamina,

237
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,041
and you'll be able to use
that to your advantage.

238
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,375
How come you're not dodging them?

239
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,375
That's absurd!

240
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,625
Hayami's punches will outnumber
these rocks!

241
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,583
I'm not gonna tell you
to dodge all of them!

242
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,791
But improve parrying, blocking,
and other skills

243
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,125
to avoid fatal blows.

244
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,833
That's what gloves are for!

245
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,375
Thank you for your instructions!

246
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,291
All right! Let's get started!

247
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,333
Yes, sir!

248
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,333
Keep bobbing your head constantly!

249
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,875
If your head stops,
it'll become a perfect target!

250
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:46,875
Yes, sir!

251
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,291
{\an8}CHINESE NOODLE RESTAURANT IWATA

252
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,583
{\an8}What a ridiculously tough training
you've started.

253
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,541
{\an8}Your face is covered with bumps.

254
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,291
{\an8}Well, someone like me
can't even be on equal footing

255
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,125
with Hayami-san if I stick
to an ordinary type of training.

256
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,083
You're working hard until late at night.

257
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,500
You have your semi-final match tomorrow.

258
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,250
No problem.

259
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,541
Even if I hurry home,
I won't be able to sleep.

260
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,333
He's always like that before a match.

261
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,250
He gets more nervous than necessary

262
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,875
and that's how he lost some of
the matches.

263
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:21,875
Shut up.

264
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,041
An insensitive bozo
like you wouldn't understand.

265
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,958
Why do you need to be nervous?

266
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,041
You have no reason to be under pressure.

267
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,125
You make such good ramen noodles.

268
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:36,208
You don't need to worry
about your career after you retire.

269
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,125
Uh... Aoki-san. Please don't pay
attention to that.

270
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,041
I'll come tomorrow to cheer you on!

271
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,750
Don't butter him up. The truth is,

272
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,625
you're more concerned about Hayami
in the curtain-raiser match.

273
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,541
Well, of course, that's the truth.

274
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,083
I bet he's extraordinary.

275
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,750
Hey, Ippo. Everything is relative,
you know.

276
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,041
No matter how awesome Hayami may be,

277
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,791
he's just a curtain-raiser for Aoki.

278
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,791
You're right. Aoki-san's curtain-raiser.

279
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,000
That's right! Aoki-san's curtain-raiser,
after all!

280
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,750
You're right!

281
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,833
If I look at it that way,
I feel more relaxed!

282
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,416
Right.

283
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,541
You are absolutely right!

284
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:24,208
I'm just a good-for-nothing boxer
who can only make ramen noodles!

285
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,458
I'm so sorry, Aoki-san.
I got a little carried away.

286
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,750
You have no idea.

287
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,541
I'm so sorry. Sorry!

288
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,500
Come on, Takamura-san,
please say something!

289
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,291
If you're done eating, just go home!

290
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:45,166
Come on, Aoki.
Can't you relax a little more?

291
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,291
It'll be a while before it's your turn.

292
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:51,291
I am fine. I am calm.

293
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:59,833
The third round of the Eastern Japan
Rookie Championship is about to begin!

294
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,166
The red corner,

295
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,958
125 and three-quarters pounds,

296
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,083
from Otowa Gym.

297
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,583
Ryuichi Hayami!

298
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,916
Hayami-kun! We're here for you!

299
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,250
Let's see what he's made of,

300
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,250
and see if he really deserves
all this cheering!

301
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,833
I don't care if the entire audience
becomes my enemy!

302
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,166
I'm gonna cheer for
his opponent, Yasukawa!

303
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,083
Okay.

304
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:43,166
<i>I get to see him in a match
before I fight him.</i>

305
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,083
<i>I want to study him as much as I can.</i>

306
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,666
Round One!

307
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,708
Amazing! He is weaving
through the barrage of punches!

308
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,958
What do you think
you're doing to my Hayami?!

309
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,916
Please don't hit his face!
He's too handsome!

310
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,500
Not bad! The timing
to dive in is just perfect!

311
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,166
Yasukawa has an excellent knack
for offense,

312
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,791
but he's not punching much.

313
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,916
He must be going for endurance!

314
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,041
<i>It's the same tactics
as Chief came up with.</i>

315
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,541
<i>I can learn a lot from this!</i>

316
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,291
Hayami is being aggressive too.

317
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,375
He must have realized Yasukawa's tactics,

318
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,583
but he doesn't care.

319
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,625
Hey. He's letting him sink punches
in way too much.

320
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,000
Come on! Dive in like earlier!

321
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,958
Well, he can't!
Hayami's speed is going up!

322
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,958
At this rate, it's gonna get faster!

323
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,375
You've got to be kidding!
He keeps punching for so long!

324
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,000
Damn it!

325
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,666
You dummy! You shouldn't lose your temper!

326
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,333
Oh, man!

327
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,166
Tsk! How annoying.

328
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,833
<i>What incredible strength!</i>

329
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:59,000
<i>He's not a half-baked prodigy.</i>

330
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,208
<i>He has already overcome
the issues of stamina.</i>

331
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,750
<i>With the way I'm training now...</i>

332
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,916
<i>I'll never be able to defeat Hayami-san.</i>

333
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:10,916
<i>Some sort of</i>...

334
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,916
<i>I need to find some sort of breakthrough.</i>

335
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:34,625
<i>Short uppercut.</i>

336
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,083
<i>Compact upward swing
to the opponent's chin</i>

337
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,333
<i>who has stepped forward
to come deep inside you.</i>

338
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,833
<i>It's hard to see it coming,
and it's hard to dodge it,</i>

339
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,541
<i>even for a boxer with brilliant footwork.</i>

340
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,125
<i>It's the type of punch,
specifically aimed for in-fighters.</i>

341
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,583
<i>But I won't give up!
I want to win no matter what!</i>

342
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:53,541
<i>I'll win to get in
the ring for the final match!</i>

343
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,875
<i>I'll have to win to keep
my promise from that day!</i>

344
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,583
<i>Next time, "The Way to Capture a Prodigy."</i>
