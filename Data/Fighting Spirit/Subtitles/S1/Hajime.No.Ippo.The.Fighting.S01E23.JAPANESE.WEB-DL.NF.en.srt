ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,666
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,750
Whoa, he's down! Hayami is down!

4
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:48,208
The referee waves his arms!
The match will not continue!

5
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,333
The fight is over!

6
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,666
I... I did it.

7
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,041
I won.

8
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,000
All right!

9
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,333
Oh, it's morning.

10
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:18,333
THE OTHER SEMI-FINAL

00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,833
{\an8}FISHING BOAT RENTAL MAKUNOUCHI

00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:21,750
{\an8}IPPO MAKUNOUCHI

13
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,875
{\an8}<i>I still can't believe that
I beat Hayami-san.</i>

14
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,000
<i>I finally got to the final match</i>

15
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,625
<i>of the Eastern Japan
Rookie Championship Tournament!</i>

16
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,500
"To Ippo: I'm off to work."

17
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,208
"Eat whatever you want for breakfast."

18
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,458
"Do as the Chief told you,

19
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,250
and use today to get some rest, huh?"

20
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:53,458
Come to think of it,
I haven't rested at all recently.

21
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:58,041
<i>Now that I'm lying down,
I feel the aching all over.</i>

22
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,000
<i>I guess this is what
they call "accumulated damage."</i>

23
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,666
<i>I'm going to do as everybody says
and take it easy today.</i>

24
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,000
<i>Still, I'm amazed I beat them.</i>

25
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,500
<i>Ozuma-san...</i>

26
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,625
<i>Kobashi-san...</i>

27
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,958
<i>and Hayami-san.</i>

28
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,083
<i>No!</i>

29
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:37,291
<i>I have to shut off my brain
and get some rest today!</i>

30
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,875
<i>Oh, man!</i>

31
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,791
<i>I feel so restless when I'm staying still!</i>

32
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,958
It's all right to do
light exercise, right?

33
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,750
Hey! A man who's
after the world championship

34
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,541
can't get exhausted like this!

35
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,500
At least let me rest a little, you sadist!

36
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,416
If you don't knock it off, I'll die!

37
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,250
Stop whining!

38
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,583
That idiot! I told him to rest!

39
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,583
Come on, old man! Stop wasting time!

40
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,708
Get moving!

41
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,000
What?! You were whining
like a girl a second ago!

42
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:50,958
Shut up!

43
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,166
<i>I ended up doing my usual roadwork.</i>

44
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,458
<i>Habits are scary!</i>

45
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,750
<i>But at least I feel calmer now.</i>

46
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,041
<i>I'll forget about boxing
and think about something else.</i>

47
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,666
<i>She's there!</i>

48
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,916
Oh, well!

49
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,333
<i>Takamura-san and others aren't here?!</i>

50
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,166
<i>I wouldn't want them to see me.</i>

51
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,500
Welcome!

52
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,916
<i>She's cute every single time I see her!</i>

53
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,000
<i>She's looking this way!</i>

54
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,833
<i>She's still looking!</i>

55
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,000
<i>What could it be?!</i>

56
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,041
<i>I've already picked out buns.
What should I do?</i>

57
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,750
<i>I have to go to the register
or I can't pay for them!</i>

58
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,625
-I'll take these.
-Um...

59
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,041
Wow!

60
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,041
Uh, well...

61
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,166
I'm sort of a boxer, so...

62
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,041
Oh, I thought so.

63
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,250
Huh?

64
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,500
I thought that might be the case.

65
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,833
You have bandages on your face a lot.

66
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,041
Oh, really?

67
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,083
Is it fun?

68
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,041
I was wondering if boxing was fun.

69
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,000
Um...

70
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,583
Well, it's painful sometimes, but...

71
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,583
I think it's fun, yes.

72
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,541
That's true!

73
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,958
You do it because it's fun, right?

74
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,333
I'm sure it's hard work,
but please give it your best!

75
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,833
Sure!

76
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,916
<i>"Please give it your best!"</i>

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,833
<i>That girl is so cute!</i>

78
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,416
<i>Although I'm sure she's Miyata-kun's fan.</i>

79
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:49,166
<i>Huh? But she didn't look too happy
when he won the last match.</i>

80
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,625
<i>She isn't his fan? That would mean...</i>

81
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,916
<i>I have a chance!</i>

82
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,083
<i>Maybe she'll come see one of my fights.</i>

83
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,708
<i>I have to make it a match
that I won't be ashamed of!</i>

84
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,625
<i>A match I can be proud of</i>...

85
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,166
<i>I reached the final one step ahead of him,</i>

86
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,083
<i>but I have to work hard to give him
a fight that won't disappoint him.</i>

87
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,625
‪KORAKUEN HALL

88
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,041
I'm going to drop by the gym.
How about you?

89
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,000
Excuse me.

90
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,166
Sorry we're late.

91
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,666
-Hey...
-What's this?

92
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:41,666
Hey, Mashiba.

93
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,291
Hey...

94
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:50,208
125 pounds. Ichiro Miyata
is within the weight limit.

95
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,666
125,5 pounds.

96
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,958
Ryo Mashiba is also within
the weight limit.

97
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,166
Well, I'm heading home now, Dad.

98
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,625
Huh? Hey, go say hi to him.

99
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,250
Don't forget your manners.

100
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,541
Uh, right.

101
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,166
What a heartwarming father-son scene.

102
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,958
Are you going to run to Daddy
for comfort when you lose?

103
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:18,166
Comfort from a second-class boxer,
who failed to become a champion.

104
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,458
Check this out!

105
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,416
Don't be so hasty.
We'll settle this tomorrow.

106
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,541
{\an8}THE NEXT DAY

107
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,666
{\an8}This is a large crowd.
How do you feel now?

108
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, I feel as nervous as
if I were fighting in this match.

109
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,666
Both Miyata and Mashiba
were full of pep at the weigh-in.

110
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,958
Really?

111
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,208
<i>Oh, it's her!</i>

112
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,791
<i>I knew it. She's Miyata-kun's fan.</i>

113
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,791
Ippo! Get over here!

114
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:00,958
Right!

115
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,958
ROOM D

116
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,958
-Have you got the ice?
-Yes, we're all ready.

117
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,000
You're cold. What happened
to your warm-up?

118
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,166
Oh, right.

119
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,208
Mashiba is a tough opponent,
so I'm sure you feel the pressure, but...

120
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:21,250
Sort of. I'm feeling twice
the usual pressure.

121
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,541
But not because of Mashiba.

122
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,500
I was thinking about him.

123
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,791
<i>He came through perfectly on the promise</i>

124
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,291
<i>that I forced him to make.</i>

125
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,041
He's an amazing guy.

126
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,291
This time, I have to live up
to his expectations.

127
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:45,958
Not bad.

128
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,750
ROOM B

129
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,416
Just ignore him.

130
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,708
Uh, right.

131
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,541
He's about to fight a match,
but he's just standing there.

132
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,750
He's kind of depressing to look at, huh?

133
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,250
Oops.

134
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,666
It's time.

135
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,000
What's wrong? Normally,
you never get nervous.

136
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,208
I was lost in thought for a moment.

137
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:20,125
I wonder what cooking method
would preserve his natural flavor?

138
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:29,666
Finally, the Eastern Japan Rookie
Championship Tournament Semi-Final

139
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,500
is about to begin!

140
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:37,291
In the red corner, weighing 125 pounds,
from Kawahara Gym...

141
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:41,166
Ichiro Miyata!

142
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:46,666
In the blue corner,
weighing 125 and a half pounds,

143
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,541
from Toho Gym...

144
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,500
Ryo Mashiba!

145
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,333
It's finally time!

146
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,208
Hey! Chill out a little.

147
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,708
The audience is
quietly waiting for the opening bell.

148
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,250
You're right.

149
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,916
This is a showdown
between two first-class, solid punchers.

150
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,458
Solid punchers?

151
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,333
Boxers like you, who knock down
their opponents with heavy blows

152
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,958
are called hard-punchers.

153
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,458
Those who knock down opponents
with sharp and timely blows

154
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,250
are called solid punchers.

155
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,375
Wow.

156
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:22,000
Miyata and Mashiba are both
the type who slice in a split second.

157
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:26,500
The audience is bracing themselves
so they won't miss the moment it happens.

158
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,333
A split second...

159
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,500
What's your prediction of the outcome?

160
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,875
Naturally, I want Miyata-kun to win!

161
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,750
I mean, I think he'll win.

162
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,875
I'm for Miyata too.

163
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,458
He's slightly above Mashiba
on every front,

164
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,000
including speed and technique.

165
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,500
But we can't be optimistic!

166
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,666
Mashiba has height on his side.

167
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:53,541
How will Miyata cope
with those long-reaching flicker jabs?

168
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:58,125
Mashiba has 177 cm to Miyata's 172 cm.

169
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,250
Mashiba's reach is also
ten centimeter wider.

170
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,875
There's that much difference?

171
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,416
How far can Miyata's speed overcome
the handicap of reach?

172
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,000
This match is very intriguing.

173
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,250
Miyata-kun.

174
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:31,083
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

175
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,541
Now, both sides are testing the water.

176
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,541
They make tiny feints,
maintaining their rhythms.

177
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,541
Who will take the initiative?
The distance gradually diminishes.

178
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,208
Miyata breaks the ice!

179
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,041
Amazing! It's like they sliced each other
as they passed.

180
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,041
Miyata's right-hand grazed Mashiba's cheek

181
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,416
but there is no damage!

182
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,500
<i>Bastard.</i>

183
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,500
So, Miyata barely has the upper hand.

184
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,333
His speed has become even slicker.

185
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,458
It'd take a move from hell to
catch him the way he's fighting.

186
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,500
His footwork is brilliant,
but I'm more impressed

187
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,500
by how calmly he deals
with Mashiba-san's fast swing.

188
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:56,958
I believe one of Miyata's strengths
is his cleverness.

189
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,541
His target counterpunches

190
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,500
and concentration are extraordinary.

191
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:05,250
Mess with him haphazardly,
and he'll punch back with accuracy.

192
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,000
As amazing as Mashiba-san is,
he has no way of fighting back.

193
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,541
But considering his personality,

194
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,750
he won't wait for the first move.

195
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,208
Hitman style!

196
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,750
<i>Now it's getting interesting.</i>

197
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,708
He uses that motion to
confuse his opponent, and then...

198
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,041
The flicker!

199
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,416
Good going! He swayed around it!

200
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,708
Mashiba's jab scores a clean hit!

201
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,000
<i>So, it extends from there too!</i>

202
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,833
He's so far away!

203
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,125
His punch is so long and fast,
it's confusing Miyata.

204
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,333
This time, Miyata is stumped.

205
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,583
<i>You can't box from that far away.</i>

206
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,541
<i>Come here!</i>

207
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:19,541
<i>You took me a little off-guard,
but you shouldn't have made that barrage.</i>

208
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,083
<i>Now I know your range and angles.</i>

209
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,000
Now he's assuming the hitman style!

210
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,875
And his right arm is in front.
It's a southpaw!

211
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,791
<i>This is an insult.</i>

212
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,500
<i>Shoulder-block!</i>

213
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,750
<i>Too slow!</i>

214
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,208
Mashiba is down!

215
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,708
-A counterpunch!
-Bang on!

216
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,000
He's strong!

217
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,625
Go to your neutral corner!

218
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,750
He got him with an amazing counterpunch!

219
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,875
I missed it.

220
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,000
What was that?!

221
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,625
Hey. Is it over so soon?

222
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm surprised.

223
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,875
So, Miyata was using the hitman style
to use the shoulder-block.

224
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,875
He also calculated exactly
when to throw a counterpunch.

225
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,708
Mashiba's middle is
defenseless because of his long arms.

226
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,750
<i>That's not something
you can easily put into practice.</i>

227
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,583
<i>He blocked those fast flicker jabs.</i>

228
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,000
<i>That proves his eyesight
is way above average.</i>

229
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,583
His reflexes and eyesight are amazing!

230
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,250
His boxing level is way too high!

231
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,375
<i>Stand up! This is no time to kneel!</i>

232
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,625
-Can you continue?
-Of course I can!

233
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,958
All right, box!

234
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:56,916
The final blow!

235
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:07,333
The bell rings mercilessly,
ending the first round!

236
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,416
What a time for the bell to ring!

237
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,708
That first round was breathtaking!

238
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,833
Three minutes went by
in the blink of an eye!

239
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,708
That was so close.

240
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:22,458
Yeah. But I'm sure he's retaining
a lot of the damage.

241
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,333
I'll knock him down in the next round.

242
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,625
Be careful. He might
have something else waiting

243
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,333
if you go in too quickly.

244
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,083
He'll probably fight like mad.

245
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:32,833
Okay.

246
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,708
Damn!

247
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:40,541
Good job getting up!
Listen, use your legs in the second round.

248
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,375
He's a precision timing genius.

249
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,125
If you trade punches, he'll let you
have a counterpunch.

250
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,875
Keep your distance
until the damage is gone!

251
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,375
Hey, are you listening?

252
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,166
I've left it up to you until now,

253
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,708
but Miyata isn't someone
you can beat by yourself.

254
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,375
Round two is about to start!

255
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,666
This is the important round.

256
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,375
Naturally, Miyata will focus on
knocking him down.

257
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,125
How will Mashiba try to escape?

258
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,708
-Mashiba leaps at him!
-What?!

259
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,791
How stubborn is this guy?!

260
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,416
He didn't try to escape,
and launched an attack on Miyata!

261
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,708
Ichiro, go around him! Don't get cornered!

262
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,750
Hey, they're going to duke it out!

263
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,291
<i>I won't let damaged goods beat me
in a fist fight!</i>

264
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:29,000
<i>If I back down now, he'll laugh at me!</i>

265
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,541
Mashiba is more powerful.

266
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,833
Damn!

267
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,791
Miyata has out-hit him!
What's wrong, Mashiba?!

268
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,083
Use your legs, you idiot!

269
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,291
You can't beat him by surprise!

270
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,083
Miyata has also built up his power.

271
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,666
Yes, and he can easily switch
from up to down!

272
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,458
Miyata-kun has mastered
in-fighting combinations, and...

273
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,541
That's right.

274
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,333
To do it that smoothly,

275
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:05,000
he must have practiced it a lot
in order to fight a certain somebody.

276
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:05,916
What?

277
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,541
-You should be thankful.
-I have mixed feelings on that.

278
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,041
-Go for it, Miyata!
-You can get him!

279
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:17,541
<i>Damn! I won't lose
to a spoiled brat like you!</i>

280
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,750
<i>He still has some power left.</i>

281
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:30,791
<i>But I'm afraid I have to finish this.
I need to get to the next round!</i>

282
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,458
Miyata rushes him!

283
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,791
Mashiba's guard is gradually
getting looser!

284
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,291
<i>He's...</i>

285
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,291
<i>waiting for me</i>...

286
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,041
Mashiba is hobbling!

287
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,541
<i>...at the top!</i>

288
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,541
Awesome!

289
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,166
<i>It's over.</i>

290
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,458
That clinches it.

291
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,541
Your wimpy punch had no effect.

292
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,166
<i>Get real. Why would I get
hit by one of those roundhouses?</i>

293
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,708
<i>You bastard! I can't lose!</i>

294
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,333
<i>No matter who I'm up against!</i>

295
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,166
<i>I can't afford to lose!</i>

296
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,666
<i>Counterpunch!</i>

297
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,708
-This is bad!
-He took one right in the face!

298
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,458
Miyata-kun!

299
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,291
Ichiro!

300
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,708
Mashiba rushes Miyata!

301
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,958
Miyata can't get away!
He's being pulverized!

302
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,666
He's down! Mashiba, stop!

303
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,666
Stop it, Mashiba!

304
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,666
Mashiba! Go back to your neutral corner!

305
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,625
This is explosive!

306
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,541
Mashiba catches Miyata in a barrage!

307
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,916
Can Miyata stand?!

308
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,416
<i>Hungry. A longing
in the heart for victory,</i>

309
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,291
<i>just like a person dying
of thirst longs for water.</i>

310
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,125
<i>The spirit that refuses to fall,
no matter how many hits are taken.</i>

311
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,125
<i>A boxer always bears
a heavy burden of reasons to win.</i>

312
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:53,375
<i>That's why he stands up.
That's why he challenges.</i>

313
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,875
<i>The fight is no longer physical,</i>

314
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,708
<i>it's a fight inside the mind!</i>

315
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,291
<i>Next time, "To The Promised Place..."</i>
