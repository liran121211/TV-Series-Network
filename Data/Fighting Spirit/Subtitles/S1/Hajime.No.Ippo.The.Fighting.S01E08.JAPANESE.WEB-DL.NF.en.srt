ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,608
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,635
KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

4
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,886
Chief?

5
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,973
About Kimura's next match...

6
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,312
We had a request for a match
from Takahashi-san's gym.

7
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,438
I see.

8
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:49,192
They also have another light-class
boxer in the same gym, you see...

9
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,279
and they suggested a match
between him and our Aoki.

10
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,823
By the way, Yagi-chan...

11
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,992
When is the application deadline
for the next pro certification exam?

12
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,453
Huh? Uh...

13
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,665
I believe it's the 15th.

14
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,000
I see.

15
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:12,674
PROMISE TO MEET AGAIN

16
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:13,675
{\an8}FISHING BOAT RENTAL MAKUNOUCHI

17
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,677
{\an8}Bye, Mom!

18
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,894
<i>The barrage stopped!</i>

19
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:38,241
<i>I wonder what Miyata-kun thought
of my uppercut?</i>

20
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,200
"It was awesome!"

21
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,412
{\an8}That would be cool!

22
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,957
{\an8}Now I might actually be able
to be friends with him!

23
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,711
Wow! What am I going to do?
I'm getting nervous!

24
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,972
<i>Oh. He isn't here yet.</i>

25
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,476
-Hey, Makunouchi.
-Yes?

26
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,979
-Why are you training?
-Huh?

27
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,608
You took a lot of damage during
yesterday's sparring match, didn't you?

28
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,235
I thought you would be at home
taking it easy today.

29
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,529
Uh, is that how it works?

30
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:21,284
A boxer also has to manage his own body,
so don't push yourself too hard.

31
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,493
Uh, sure.

32
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,662
I see.

33
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,082
<i>I guess that means
Miyata-kun won't be coming in today.</i>

34
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,002
<i>Oh, well. I'll probably
get to see him tomorrow.</i>

35
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,504
{\an8}THE NEXT DAY

36
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,114
<i>He didn't show up today either.</i>

37
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,742
<i>I wonder what happened to him?</i>

38
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:05,995
Excuse me...

39
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,956
What's up, Ippo?

40
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,584
Aoki-san, Kimura-san,
have you seen Miyata-kun?

41
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,919
Miyata?

42
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,546
We ran into him
when we were out doing roadwork.

43
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,507
What? I see.

44
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,262
<i>So, he is training.</i>

45
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,222
<i>I wonder why he hasn't come in?</i>

46
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,724
What's with the girly punches?

47
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,936
Hey, why the frown?

48
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,480
Uh, it's nothing. I'm sorry.

49
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,817
I was thinking about Miyata-kun.

50
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,988
He hasn't been in lately,
so I was wondering what happened to him.

51
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,825
Miyata hasn't been in?
Of course he hasn't!

52
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,826
Huh?

53
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,415
He lost to a slob like you!
How could he come to the gym?

54
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,417
If it were me, I'd kill myself.

55
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,920
What? No way.

56
00:04:56,587 --> 00:05:01,050
I bet it was a huge shock to him.
I bet he can't recover from it.

57
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,429
Miyata-kun...

58
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,559
Yeah, right. Just fooling you!

59
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,730
We can't go killing ourselves
over every silly, little sparring match!

60
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,066
All righty? So don't get so worried.

61
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,366
Takamura-san, you're so mean!

62
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,371
Use more strength, will you?!

63
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,874
Don't depend on your right!
Use your left more!

64
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,879
You're not putting your hip into it!
Step in, one-two!

65
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:38,921
Right!

66
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,633
More!

67
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,514
What are you doing?!
Your guard is too loose!

68
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,643
Huh?

69
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,229
I give up.

70
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,856
Go for a run and cool your head.

71
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,485
Why, sir? I'm doing the best I can.

72
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,031
Doing the best you can, huh?!
You punched like a wet sponge!

73
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,158
You can't become a pro like that!

74
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,493
Huh?

75
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,328
Uh... Yes, sir.

76
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,999
Enough, now go running.

77
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,542
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,674
What's the matter?
I thought he looked pretty good.

79
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,718
Only on the surface.

80
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,720
I couldn't feel an ounce of tension

81
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,557
in any of his punches like I did
before his sparring match with Miyata.

82
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,353
Ah, so he can't put any spirit
into it because Miyata-kun isn't here?

83
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,231
This is bad. Unless he improves,

84
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,358
I can't turn in his application
for the exam.

85
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:44,112
So, you were asking about
the exam on Ippo-kun's behalf.

86
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:50,159
Yeah. I must do something so
Miyata's determination isn't wasted.

87
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,212
At least Takamura is right
on track for next week's match.

88
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,214
His diet also seems to be going well.

89
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:07,426
Yes. His fighting spirit
before a match never fails to impress me.

90
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,516
Hmm... Maybe I'll leave
the kid with Takamura!

91
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,769
What?! Don't you think
that's a little reckless?

92
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,314
Takamura's training menu preceding
a match is murderous!

93
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:24,569
That may be exactly the kind
of shock the kid needs right now.

94
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,534
You're late, kid!

95
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,161
Takamura's already gone!

96
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,787
What? Takamura-san?!

97
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:39,125
For the next week,
you'll be training with him!

98
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,501
Now, hurry up and follow him!

99
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:44,755
Huh? What do you mean?
Besides, I just got back from running.

100
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,717
-Don't argue with me! Get going, now!
-Yes, sir!

101
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,386
<i>What was that all about?!</i>

102
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,808
Takamura-san!

103
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,767
What?

104
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,564
The old man already talked to me.
You're with me as of today, huh?

105
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,065
Yes!

106
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,320
Did you do something to him?
He was in a foul mood.

107
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,364
No, I have no idea why he's upset.

108
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,867
Hmm, really?

109
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,828
Oh, well. Let's go!

110
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,996
Uh, right!

111
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,128
<i>Good. I should be able
to keep up with him.</i>

112
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,301
<i>I did plenty of running with the Chief,
so I have faith in my legs!</i>

113
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,513
How will the next match go?

114
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,307
Don't be stupid! I'll win, of course!

115
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,310
That's true! I'll be there
to cheer you on!

116
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,436
Great!

117
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,327
<i>How... long is he going to keep running?!</i>

118
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,915
Actually, my opponent has won
with straight KOs up till now.

119
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,835
But if he takes one of my punches,
he won't last through the first round!

120
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,216
Huh?

121
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,094
<i>Oh, man!</i>

122
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,355
<i>Good. He finally stopped.</i>

123
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,120
<i>I feel his punches on my stomach
through the sandbag!</i>

124
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,340
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

125
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,720
<i>Is this the workload of a man
with an empty stomach?!</i>

126
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,146
<i>He finally stopped.</i>

127
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,188
Hey!

128
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,942
-We're going running.
-What?!

129
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,700
<i>It's hard. Too hard.</i>

130
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,794
<i>We're at totally different levels!</i>

131
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:33,341
<i>At this rate, I'll get in the way of
Takamura-san's fine tuning.</i>

132
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,846
<i>I wonder why the Chief made an amateur
like me train with someone so great?</i>

133
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,725
Huh? What's the matter?
Are you already going belly up?

134
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,479
You are really awesome, Takamura-san.

135
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:51,442
To be able to continue this hard training
in silence, without being instructed.

136
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,945
Well, that's a wimpy thing to say!

137
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,699
Are you saying you can't move
unless someone swats your butt?

138
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,286
Uh, no. It's not that...

139
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,163
Then what is it?

140
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:09,377
It's just kind of lonesome
because Miyata-kun hasn't shown up lately.

141
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:18,219
Are you coming to
our gym to look for friends?

142
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,220
Huh?

143
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,932
Weren't you going to become a boxer?!

144
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,227
You'll never make it
with that kind of attitude.

145
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,230
The world of professional boxing
isn't that easy!

146
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:47,915
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

147
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,795
All right, time to go home!

148
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,257
What's with the long face?

149
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,092
Huh? Yeah.

150
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:02,179
Oh, I see. It's probably
that scolding I gave you earlier.

151
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,058
I'm so hungry, you see, that sometimes
I get irritated during training.

152
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,311
Oh, yeah. That's true.

153
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,314
Hey, want to come to my pad?

154
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,359
-What? Are you sure?
-Sure!

155
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,571
-Are you sure I can come over?!
-Uh, sure.

156
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:22,658
Wow! It's been years since
I got invited over by someone!

157
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,662
<i>This guy really must not have any friends.</i>

158
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,877
What's the matter?
Don't be shy. Come on in.

159
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,003
Uh, right.

160
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,006
Go ahead and find a place to sit.
I've got to whiz.

161
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,472
There's no place to sit in here!

162
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,433
Hope he doesn't mind if I clean up a bit.

163
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,271
ADULT MAGAZINE

164
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,023
There isn't a single normal magazine.

165
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:04,283
There's so little fluid in my body,
I can't even pee.

166
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,872
<i>He's taking a long time in there.</i>

167
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,789
Huh?

168
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,139
<i>Stare</i>...

169
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,478
No... Stop!

170
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,189
Hey, Aoki! I just caught Ippo
with a porn mag!

171
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,694
What? Ippo's doing porn?!

172
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,240
{\an8}Here, eat this. You must be hungry.

173
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,700
{\an8}But you're on a diet, aren't you?

174
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,911
I can't eat in front of you.

175
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,957
Idiot, don't hold back for my sake.
I've got something for myself, too.

176
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,960
Really? Okay.

177
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:03,217
Huh? Takamura-san, is that tomato...?

178
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,177
Is that all you're having for dinner?

179
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,262
Yeah!

180
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,931
Never mind me and eat up.

181
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,896
Once you're a top-notch boxer like me,
dieting is nothing.

182
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:21,402
<i>I heard that a severe diet
is like hellish torture,</i>

183
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,029
<i>but Takamura-san makes it look easy.</i>

184
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,159
<i>It's like he really
was born to be a boxer.</i>

185
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,244
De-lish.

186
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,832
Come to think of it,
I never asked this before.

187
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:40,004
How did you first become
involved with boxing, Takamura-san?

188
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,632
Why the sudden curiosity?
I forgot about that ages ago.

189
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,594
What?! But surely you had a reason!

190
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,473
Well, you don't need a good reason
to start something.

191
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,519
<i>I used to fight all the time, you see.</i>

192
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,356
<i>That's when I made the geezer's
acquaintance and he introduced me to it.</i>

193
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,818
<i>I had nothing better to do,</i>

194
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,280
<i>so I gave it a shot
and I won my debut match.</i>

195
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,788
And then, the applause
fell on me like rain.

196
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,583
It's the greatest feeling.

197
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,086
It was the first time
I was praised by another person.

198
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,839
How can I put it?

199
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,677
It's like the fists I didn't know how
to use were recognized by the public.

200
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,597
I don't know how to describe it.

201
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,308
I understand! I totally understand!

202
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,561
I totally understand how that feels!

203
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,314
-Oh... Really?
-Yeah!

204
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,484
-Want to stay the night?
-Sure!

205
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:07,633
<i>Damn! I'm so hungry,
a hole could burn through my stomach!</i>

206
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,901
I wonder what he's doing up so late?

207
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,785
<i>I... I'm so stupid!</i>

208
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,372
<i>There's no way it's not hard!</i>

209
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,307
Ippo! Hold it tighter!

210
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,808
Right! I'm sorry!

211
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,311
Kid!

212
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:46,231
Takamura's long gone!
Get your butt in gear and follow him!

213
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,025
Yes, sir!

214
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,987
-Oh?
-It seems to have worked perfectly.

215
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:56,700
Right. I thought he should experience
the severity of being a pro firsthand.

216
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,829
Now he has the face of
someone who could be in the ring.

217
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,249
-I'll send in the application.
-Yeah.

218
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,963
Takamura-san,
your match is tomorrow, right?

219
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,881
Yeah!

220
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:14,593
I'm kind of nervous because
I've never been to Korakuen Hall before.

221
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,514
Is this your first time
watching a match in person?

222
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,723
Yes.

223
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,809
I see.

224
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,148
I'll show you
what a professional fight is all about.

225
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,567
Right!

226
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:36,240

{\an8}GO, HIRANO! WIN, HIRANO!

232
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,308
Wow! This is amazing!

233
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,105
Takamura-san is actually going to
fight in front of all these people.

234
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,526
Thank you for waiting,
ladies and gentlemen!

235
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,070
Today's main event...

236
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:19,741
the Japan Middleweight
ten-round match is about to begin.

237
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,831
We've been waiting for this, Takamura!

238
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,374
Enough with the corny theme song!

239
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:30,836
-It's Takamura-san's big entrance!
-Hurry up!

240
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,341
There he is! Drop him in one punch!

241
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,345
That's so cool! He's really popular!

242
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,149
What's wrong, Takamura?!
Did you lose too much weight to punch?!

243
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,734
<i>Takamura-san...</i>

244
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,379
The winner, Takamura!

245
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,888
He won. Takamura-san won!

246
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,187
<i>It's a lot of work to be a pro, but...</i>

247
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,314
<i>I want to stand up there too.</i>

248
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,859
<i>I want to become a professional boxer
and stand in this ring!</i>

249
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,827
{\an8}‪KORAKUEN HALL

250
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,136
-Miyata-kun!
-Hey.

251
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,640
You came to cheer on Takamura-san too!

252
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:11,645
There was also that, but I thought
I'd run into you if I came here.

253
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,106
What? You came to see me?

254
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,067
Yeah. There was something
I wanted to tell you.

255
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,151
Huh?

256
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,196
I quit Kamogawa Gym.

257
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,282
What?! But why?

258
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,035
Is it because you lost to me?

259
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,540
Yeah, that's right. It's all your fault!

260
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:39,214
However, I didn't quit the gym for
a trifling reason like embarrassment.

261
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,427
I did it because if I belonged to
the same gym as you, I wouldn't be able to

262
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,721
fight you in the professional ring.

263
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,057
Miyata-kun!

264
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,269
So far, we each have one win and one loss.

265
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,771
Let's settle the final score
in the ring as pros.

266
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,777
Very well. I'll see you next
in the professional ring!

267
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,994
The final match of
the Eastern Japan Tournament!

268
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,829
That's the only place I'll wait for you.

269
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,622
Right!

270
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,668
<i>License. My dream.
The proof I'm a pro boxer.</i>

271
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,672
<i>My ticket to a world
where strong men are common.</i>

272
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,634
<i>I'm uneasy, but I'm determined
to do my best in this world.</i>

273
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:52,389
<i>Because I promised!
It's a steep and rugged path,</i>

274
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,474
<i>but there's someone
waiting for me at the top!</i>

275
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,852
<i>Next time, "C Class License."</i>
