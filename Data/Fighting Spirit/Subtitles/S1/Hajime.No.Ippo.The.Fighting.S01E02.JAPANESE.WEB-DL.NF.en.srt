HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,000
Huh? What?!

4
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,791
Come over here.

5
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,208
Give this a try.

6
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,791
What? You mean me?

7
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,500
If you manage to do this,
I'll teach you boxing.

8
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,916
Can I pull something like that off?

FRUITS OF LABOR

10
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,333
But how?

11
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,250
-You want to be like me, don't you?
-What?

12
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,791
If so, you got to at least try this.

13
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,958
Let's see here.

14
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,791
You should be able to grab
at least ten leaves.

15
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,000
Ten leaves?

16
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:44,875
That's right! If you can't,
then give up the idea of becoming a boxer.

17
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,875
I'll do it! I will grab ten leaves!

18
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,291
You have one week!

19
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,750
What?! Only one week?

20
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:01,041
I was able to do it without practice.

21
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,541
What a relief! That's not too hard.

22
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,958
I should be able to get ten fairly easy.

23
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,333
One! Okay...

24
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,416
Two!

25
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:29,125
<i>There's no way an amateur
can grab ten leaves.</i>

26
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,375
<i>I was definitely surprised
by the power of that punch,</i>

27
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,416
<i>but he's not the boxer type.</i>

28
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,708
<i>He should be made to give up
the whole idea for his own good.</i>

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,625
One... two!

30
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,125
One! Huh?

31
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,791
One, two!

32
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,666
One! Two!

33
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,541
One! Two!

34
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:10,208
I... can't grab... the second leaf!

35
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,750
This is really hard!

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,916
I'm late for school!

37
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,958
I'm home!

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,458
Welcome home. Where have you been?

39
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,083
Breakfast is ready...

40
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,125
Oh, you're already eating. Chew your food!

41
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,416
See you later!

<i>ESSAYS ON IDLENESS</i>
BY KENKO YOSHIDA

43
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:37,333
"Leisurely, I face my ink stone
all day with no particular objective."

44
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:41,833
"I jot down anything that comes to mind,
with a curious feeling I am not sane..."

45
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,916
How do I grab the second leaf?

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,083
This is the famous introductory chapter
of <i>Essays on Idleness</i>.

47
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,083
Now, let's...

48
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,875
What are you doing, Makunouchi?

49
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,583
Uh, nothing. I'm sorry.

50
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,583
Have a nice trip!

51
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:05,916
All right.

52
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,291
Aw, so close!

53
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:24,250
But I need to make
the snap just a little sharper.

54
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:28,958
Just as I grab the leaf,
I have to pull it in sharply yet quickly.

55
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,708
Sharply and quickly!

56
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,875
Hey, Ippo!

57
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,625
Don't you have anything to say to us?!

58
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,875
Uh, goodbye!

59
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,083
Do you do whatever you're told?

60
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,541
You know the only thing
guys like you are good for?

61
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,000
What?

62
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,333
-Where'd he go?
-I'm not sure.

63
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:15,083
I did it! One step forward!

64
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,333
I did it!

Mom?

68
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:41,125
Oh, yeah. We had
a morning reservation today.

69
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,250
I forgot to help her.

70
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,541
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:00,750
<i>"Dear Ippo, I'm not sure what
you're so fascinated with lately...</i>

73
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:06,250
<i>but it makes me happy to
see you so active and animated."</i>

00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:11,333
<i>"Don't worry about the business.
I'm still young."</i>

<i>"So do your best
and don't get discouraged."</i>

76
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,291
Mom.

77
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,208
Yeah! My mom's cooking is the best!

78
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,125
One, two, three!

79
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,166
Four, five, six!

80
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,916
Is five my limit?

81
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,291
At dawn, it'll be the day.

82
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,208
Damn!

83
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,791
One, two, three, four...

84
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:57,416
One, two, three... four!

85
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,833
I can't do it. Maybe it's too difficult
for someone like me.

86
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,416
Maybe it takes talent
to become a new person.

87
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,208
<i>Why am I telling myself to give up?!</i>

88
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,916
<i>I'm the one who decided to do it!</i>

89
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,708
That sound.

90
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,916
It's totally different.
Maybe it's a different punching speed.

91
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,833
I need that sound.

92
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,375
Damn. I'm completely hopeless!

93
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,791
And Takamura-san did it so easily.

94
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:56,791
Huh?

95
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,208
Easily?

96
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,500
Lightly.

97
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,833
This is it!

98
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,250
It's the same sound!

99
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,916
What are you doing?

100
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:03,583
I've been waiting for you... Takamura-san.

101
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,291
Waiting for me? Did you
want to see me for some reason?

102
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,083
Oh, come on!

103
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,333
Today is the day, right?
Don't you remember?

104
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,708
You're covered with sweat.
How long have you been up working out?

105
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:22,458
You promised, okay?
Would you please come with me?

106
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:34,666
I'm so exhausted,
I think I can only do it once.

107
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,000
So please watch me carefully.

00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:09,291
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

109
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,500
I did it!

110
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,500
I did it!

111
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,000
See? Take a look at these!

112
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,916
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten leaves!

113
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,625
Whoa, I did it! I was really worried,
to tell you the truth!

114
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,333
I'm so glad I succeeded!

115
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,041
I did it!

116
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:53,000
This can't be. He's just an amateur!

117
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,625
How did he pull it off?!

118
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,791
So, I passed, right?

119
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,083
Now I can dream about
becoming a boxer, right?

120
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,791
The moment my hand touches a leaf,
I give my wrist a snap and pull it in!

121
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,541
Until the moment of contact,
I keep my fist lightly clenched!

122
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,083
Clenching my fist too tightly
would actually slow me down.

123
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,541
That's the trick, right?

124
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,291
Uh, yeah.

125
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,083
All right!

126
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh, what the heck.

127
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:26,208
I'm impressed you noticed it.
Those were pretty good jabs.

128
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,666
Jabs? Jab!

129
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,291
Jab!

130
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,875
<i>What a guy.</i>

131
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,250
<i>I meant for him to grab ten leaves
using both hands.</i>

132
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:40,041
<i>Instead, he did it
with just his left hand.</i>

133
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,375
<i>He's kind of weird,</i>

134
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,250
<i>but he might mature
into a pretty interesting boxer.</i>

135
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,458
Hey, throw me some punches.

136
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,375
Uh, sure! Jab!

137
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,833
Good! Looking good!

138
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,000
Jab!

139
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,500
Yeah! That's the way!

140
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,916
All right, I'll do my best!
I'm going to become a boxer!

141
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,708
-Whoa! Hey!
-Jab!

142
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,125
Wait a minute! Hey!

143
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,458
Jab!

144
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,791
Don't get carried away!

145
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,500

Oh, watching the World Title Match

As usual, the international level
is pretty exciting.

154

This is a dream match
between super champions.

155
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,583
I envy them. Speaking as
the manager of a boxing gym,

156
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,666
just once, I wish I could
handle a big match like that.

157
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,416
I totally agree.

158
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,666
Long ago, there used to be
a whole bunch of guys in Japan

159
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,500
who'd let us dream like that.

160
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,041
In the 20 years since I opened this gym,

161
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,791
we've had two champions
of Japan and one champion of Asia,

162
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,625
but no one to challenge the World title!

163
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,708
We have Takamura-kun.

164
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,500
Yes, he's different.

165
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,333
He's got the body
and the talent to make it big.

166
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,958
He has the potential

167
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,541
to become the most successful boxer
in this gym's history.

168
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, that reminds me. He called earlier.

169
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,125
Yo!

00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,416

This guy's going to start training today.

180
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,541
Ow! What are you doing, you mean old man?!

181
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,833
-Shut up and walk!
-Ouch!

182
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,208
Man, that hurt.

183
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,458
Hey! I heard my champ
was bringing someone in!

184
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,041
So I hoped it would be
a new face who'd go pro!

185
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,875
What kind of a letdown is that?!

186
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,750
I don't sense a trace of
combative spirit from him!

187
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,708
Yeah. Me neither!

188
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,708
What do you mean "me neither"?
Then why did you bring him here?!

189
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,416
There's no way he's going to be a winner.

190
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,958
You think that kid can become a boxer?

191
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,750
Are you blind?!

192
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,916
Don't pass judgment until you try him out!

193
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,875
I brought him over
because I believe he has potential!

194
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,333
Nice to meet you!

195
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:06,791
I can't bring myself to
believe that kid is cut out for boxing.

196
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,875
What the heck?!

197
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,416
Then, why don't you test him
with sparring or something?

198
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,666
Ooh, such confidence!
Okay, let's give it a try.

199
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,750
Are you serious?
He's totally inexperienced.

200
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:22,416
Boxing is such a dangerous sport,
one little mistake can cost you your life.

201
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,041
If he's not cut out for it,

202
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,875
it's for his own sake to give up
at an early stage.

203
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,875
Sparring?

204
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,791
It means "practice match."

205
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,500
Wow, a match!

206
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,541
You're up.

207
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,541
What?!

208
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:46,333
You must be joking!
There's no way I'm ready for that!

209
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:50,083
Don't make a fuss!
No one's telling you to win.

210
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,041
You just need to show us
what kind of potential you got.

211
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,916
Potential? But I...

212
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,666
You have no choice!

213
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,416
Would you rather go home?

214
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,916
No!

215
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,625
Here.

216
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:15,875
<i>I have no choice. I can't go home now!</i>

217
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,958
Okay, he's ready!

218
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,208
Pleased to meet you.

219
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,458
-Who's he fighting?
-That.

220
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,458
You mean Miyata?

221
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,458
Yes, although I may
not be qualified for the task.

222
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,541
This is getting interesting.

223
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,416
Who is he?

224
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,458
Ichiro Miyata. He's 16, like you.

225
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,083
He has no professional license.

226
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,333
Oh, so we're the same age!

227
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,625
If he's not a pro,
maybe we're not that different.

228
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,708
You idiot! You're totally different!

229
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,500
He's way stronger than you are!

230
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:12,333
The only reason he has no license
is because you have to be at least 17.

231
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,875
When it comes to his skills,

232
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,291
he creams your average
four-round pro boxer!

233
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,000
What?

234
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,291
He's a highly-skilled out-boxer.

235
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:25,625
Ever since he was little, he was
trained by his father, a former pro boxer.

236
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,791
In our world, he's what you call an elite.

237
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,750
He's stronger than
most professional boxers?

238
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,750
What am I supposed to do
against a guy like that?

239
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,500
That's why I'm not telling you to win!
Just show your potential!

240
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:41,916
-Show them how eager you are!
-Eager?

241
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,125
<i>That's true.</i>

242
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,625
<i>I already made up my mind
to become a boxer.</i>

243
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,083
<i>There's no turning back.</i>

244
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,500
<i>He's my age!</i>

245
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,625
<i>I might stand a small chance!</i>

246
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,125
Feeling a little calmer?

247
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,708
Yeah.

248
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,958
Listen! The rules are the same
as for a real four-round match!

249
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,708
It's the three knock-down system!

250
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,875
Three knock-down?

251
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,208
It means you lose if you fall
down three times in one round.

252
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,625
Here, put this in your mouth.

253
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,291
What was that for?

254
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,916
It looks like you've done the workout.

255
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,625
You might be able to make it through.

256
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:39,041
Okay! In the first round, I want you
to maintain a strong guard and persevere.

257
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,208
Don't lower your arms for anything.

258
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,625
After the first round,

259
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,791
I'll give you instructions
for the next round.

260
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,166
We'll call it "Operation Turtle"!

261
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,291
Turtle? Keep a strong guard
and my arms up.

262
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,625
All right, go!

263
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,416
Let's start!

264
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,083
He blanked out with the sound of the gong.

265
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,750
Idiot, why are you just standing there?

266
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,791
<i>What the heck? Is he really an amateur?</i>

267
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:35,125
You idiot! Be the turtle!
Keep your guard up!

268
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,541
I'm a turtle!

269
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,291
Aw, you idiot!

270
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,958
Ippo! Up, get up!

271
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,208
Is that all he's got?

272
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,625
What is this?

273
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,458
He hit me in the middle and...

274
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,750
I don't know what happened next!

275
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:17,833
<i>He's far different from me.</i>

276
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:37,083
<i>Sparring. With headgear on,
I get into the ring.</i>

277
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,708
<i>The ring is bigger than I thought.</i>

278
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,708
<i>But as soon as the opponent stands up,</i>

279
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,625
<i>it feels small and cramped.</i>

280
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:47,958
<i>I have to show them my potential.</i>

281
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,625
<i>My eagerness! Keep going, arms and legs!</i>

282
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,791
<i>I will become a boxer!</i>

283
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,916
<i>Next time, "Tears of Joy."</i>
