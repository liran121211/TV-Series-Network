00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:34,993
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,230
I'll be waiting for you in Osaka!

4
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,488
-Ippo!
-Uh, yeah?

5
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,991
Would you take care of
the customers over here?

6
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:57,992
Okay!

7
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:04,999
What's wrong?

8
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,293
Uh, well... Isn't one
of our clients a professor

9
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,546
at the University of
Health and Sport Science?

10
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,006
-Do you mean Professor Miyazaki?
-Yeah, that's the one.

11
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,260
Do you think he knows
a good orthopedic doctor?

12
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,682
You still can't get yourself
to give up on that match, huh?

13
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,770
Yeah. I don't want to make the decision
to withdraw before I even try.

14
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,149
Maybe there's a way to heal my fist.

15
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,278
I want to go to Osaka!

16
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,032
Oh, all right. I'll contact him for you.

17
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,576
You will?!

18
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,077
I'll contact him, and no more.

19
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,163
Thanks, Mom!

20
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,290
Ouch...

21
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:51,296
TO ENEMY GROUND

22
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:56,301
<i>Professor Miyazaki's doctor friend
is spoken of very highly.</i>

23
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,430
<i>Apparently, this doctor is quite
the combat sports fan, does judo,</i>

24
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,683
<i>and was even grand champion
at a national tournament!</i>

25
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,060
<i>If you explain your situation,</i>

26
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,146
<i>the doctor will give you a consultation.</i>

YAMAGUCHI CHIROPRACTIC CLINIC

28
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,066
<i>But if you're told
that it's not going to heal in time,</i>

29
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,820
<i>I want you to step back
and let the match go, all right?</i>

30
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:17,864
Okay.

31
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,782
Hello?

32
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,703
May I help you?

33
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,916
Uh, actually, I'm here
to see Dr. Yamaguchi.

34
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,335
Professor Miyazaki at the University...

35
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,920
Oh, so you're Makunouchi-kun.

36
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,212
Huh? How did you know?

37
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,216
I'm Dr. Yamaguchi. Pleased to meet you.

38
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,467
What?

39
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,597
Well, that's silly.
I heard you're really strong,

40
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,184
so I expected someone intimidating.
You're nothing like I imagined.

41
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,979
You really don't look like a boxer.

42
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,731
Really, ma'am?

43
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:57,195
Uh, well, I was a little surprised
to see you too...

44
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,696
Surprised?

45
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,700
Huh? Well, uh...

46
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,747
I was told you were
the number one Judo champion in Japan.

47
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,460
Oh? I may not look it,
but they used to call me "Lady Sanshiro."

48
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:16,339
No, I mean I didn't think
you'd be a woman...

49
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,967
<i>No wonder she comes so highly recommended.</i>

50
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,598
Wow. That explains it.

51
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,601
Um... Actually, it's not my shoulder
I want looked at,

52
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,561
it's my broken right fist.

53
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,731
Yeah. No wonder it broke.

54
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,193
After the match,
the pain wasn't only in your fist,

55
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,153
but your right shoulder hurts too, right?

56
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,989
Huh? Now that you mention it...

57
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,283
It's already begun to heal,

58
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,160
but your right shoulder muscles
are in very bad shape.

59
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,871
These injuries only occur
with substantial destructive power.

60
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,248
What?

61
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,293
In your case, the power
of your punch is too much

62
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,753
for your shoulders and fists to handle.

63
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,548
So, at the moment of impact,

64
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,426
the reaction injures
the strained parts of your body.

65
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,720
The Chief told me the same thing!

66
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,264
You can tell all that just
by touching my shoulder?!

67
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,975
Uh-huh, of course!

68
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,186
The professor really recommended
a great doctor! You're amazing!

69
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,939
You're amazing too.

70
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,107
Huh?

71
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,694
Hey!

72
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:25,199
YAMAGUCHI CHIROPRACTIC CLINIC

73
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,203
To be honest with you, this is difficult.

74
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,542
But "difficult" doesn't mean
it's impossible, right?

75
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,212
There is a way, isn't there?

76
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,466
Tell me, please!

77
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,385
But this is a tricky injury.

78
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,763
As a doctor, I can't recommend
you accept a match

79
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,308
that might shorten your boxing career.

80
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,019
Ippo-kun, you have
only begun to box, right?

81
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,230
For your future,
you should let this match go.

82
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,402
But that means I'd be running away.

83
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,737
Running away? Why?

84
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,364
I can't explain it well,

85
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,825
but I'm the type of boxer
who goes forward.

86
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,869
Otherwise, I can't fight.

87
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,498
If I use my injury as an excuse
to run from my match with Sendo-san,

88
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,250
I feel like I'll never be able to
be in other matches again.

89
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,254
If there's even a 1% chance
I can be in the match,

90
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,801
I want to take those odds.
I want to fight Sendo-san.

91
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,018
Would you promise me one thing?

92
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,563
I want you to follow
my rehabilitation regimen

93
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,650
for the one month remaining
until the match.

94
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,028
If you do, I believe you will
recover enough to get into the ring.

95
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,655
Really?!

96
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,784
However, I think the pain
will still persist a little.

97
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,203
If that's the case,
I will inject anesthesia

98
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,539
directly into your fist right
before the match.

99
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,791
Anesthetize my fist?

100
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,752
I think you'll be fine during the match,

101
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,922
but I hear it hurts like hell
when it wears off.

102
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,052
That's fine with me! As long as...

103
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,554
As long as I can fight the match.

104
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,807
Very well. The truth is...

105
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,934
I understand how you feel very well.

106
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,438
Let's work hard at it together
until next month's match!

107
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,400
Yes, ma'am! Thank you so much!

108
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,198
Is that the treatment
the doctor prescribed?

109
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,867
Yeah.

110
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,786
If my fist heats up during training,

111
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,247
she said it's important to cool it down.

112
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,957
I see.

113
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,711
Also, you're going to hurt your muscles
in every match at this rate.

114
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,089
Let's train your shoulder muscles
and make them strong enough

115
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,176
to absorb your destructive punching power.

116
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,429
Forty-eight...

117
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,474
Forty-nine...

118
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,017
Fifty.

from Japan for a long time, doesn't it?

122
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,950
Yeah, but now it's going to get busy.

123
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,952
Hey, did you find me an opponent?

124
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,331
Well, we were given
the cold shoulder a lot.

125
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,626
We still managed to come up
with two opponents, though.

126
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:27,381
So, my powerful reputation
has finally reached Thailand, huh?

127
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,384
Your intensive training starts
immediately. Prepare for the worst.

128
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,892
Forty-nine...

129
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,727
Fifty!

130
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,233
What the hell is that?

131
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,277
Uh... Welcome back, Chief.

132
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,988
I only left for a minute
and you started some monkey business.

133
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,491
Uh, actually... I'm...

CHIEF'S OFFICE

135
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,744
What? Inject anesthesia directly
into your fist?

136
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,997
Yes. The doctor says the same
was done in a previous case.

137
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,087
Please give me permission
to fight in the match!

138
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,257
Yes, there is a precedent for that...

139
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,343
However, injuries to
the fist tend to become chronic,

140
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,263
and the fact is, it won't stop
after a couple of incidents.

141
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,392
In the long run, I think
you should let it heal completely.

142
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,689
Ippo-kun! This is very important!

143
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,524
Don't waste your breath, Yagi-chan.

144
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,777
Once this kid thinks of something,
nothing we say can dissuade him.

145
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,154
MONTHLY BOXING FAN GO FOR THE WORLD!!

146
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,364
What are these?

147
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,283
This is material I've been hiding from you

148
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,952
to stop you from getting stirred up
about Sendo.

149
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,497
Sendo is a die-hard in-fighter
just like you.

150
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,208
He is by no means
endowed in the defense department.

151
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:49,589
But he is equipped with more
than enough power to compensate.

152
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,506
Whoa.

153
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,758
He has extraordinary destructive power.

154
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,262
Needless to say,
his opponent was hospitalized.

155
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,223
Fortunately, it was not life-threatening,

156
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,144
but he will never be able to step
in the ring as a boxer again.

157
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,231
Listen. You're suggesting
you want to take on this guy.

158
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,984
And with a handicap, no less.

159
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,653
Sendo-san is amazing.

160
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,740
Just thinking about fighting him
gives me the shivers.

161
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,409
What he's saying doesn't match
his expression.

162
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,119
Damn! He never gives up.

163
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,122
Hey, kid! Let me ask you one question.

164
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,250
Boxing is an extreme sport.

165
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,878
The lifespan of a boxer
is the shortest of any athlete.

166
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,130
Do you want to make a decision

167
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,467
that may make
your already short career even shorter?

168
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,387
I understand that fists
are a boxer's life, but...

169
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,140
If my injury becomes chronic

170
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,894
and destroys my career,
I will admit that's all the boxer I was.

171
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,145
Very well.

172
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,649
If you're that determined,
I will respect your feelings as a boxer.

173
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,486
We will proceed with practice
for your match.

174
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,030
-Thank you!
-However!

175
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,574
I'm not 100% convinced
that you're up for it.

176
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,868
The decision to proceed or withdraw
will be made

177
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,162
based on how well your fist heals
before the match.

178
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,415
-Any complaints?!
-No, sir!

179
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,919
{\an8}NANIWA BOXING CENTER

180
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,635
Looks like you're getting
the hang of the smash.

181
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,929
This is bad. That's enough for today.

182
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,138
What do you mean?

183
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,599
Even if I get the hang of the smash,

184
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,267
I can't get the hang of my opponent.

185
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,394
Sendo-san!

186
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,146
You got a package from Tokyo.

187
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,399
Oh, it's from Makunouchi.

188
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:35,903
He sure is conscientious to send me
the stuff I left behind.

189
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,949
IT LOOKS LIKE I CAN GO TO OSAKA
MAKUNOUCHI

190
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,450
Yanaoka!

191
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,035
Huh? What's up?

192
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,289
What?! Didn't you just say
you had enough for today?

193
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,792
<i>Yeah, right! If he says he'll come,</i>

194
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,086
<i>he'll come in his best condition.</i>

195
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,964
<i>I bet he's deep into
his intensive training right now!</i>

196
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,133
I can't let even a second go to waste!

197
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:06,350
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

198
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,942
-Like this?
-Yes.

199
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,696
-You look great.
-You're doing this too.

200
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,947
What?

201
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,074
There are many tough boxers in Thailand!

202
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,827
They've been going through
the rigors of kickboxing.

203
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,165
I came up with this training in order
to compete with their stamina.

204
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,250
This is stupid.

205
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,003
Are you telling me to build up stamina
this late in the game?

206
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,963
Stop muttering and get to it!

207
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,548
Ippo-kun!

208
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,842
Ippo-kun!

209
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,177
Dr. Yamaguchi!

210
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,220
What are you doing here?

211
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,431
I couldn't stop thinking
about your training.

212
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,100
The guys at the gym said you'd be here.

213
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,768
Hey, who's that?

214
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,022
She's the chiropractor I've been going to.

215
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,273
What?

216
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:03,115
You must be the Chief.
Pleased to meet you.

217
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,284
The kid told me all about you.

218
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,161
-Is this how you do it, old man?
-Yes.

219
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:13,083
<i>I doubt this kind of training
will build up stamina,</i>

220
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,628
<i>but the perks are yummy.</i>

221
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,340
<i>I bet I know what he's thinking this time.</i>

222
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:23,427
All right, now do a 50-meter dash
in that position for three laps!

223
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,347
To the steel tower and back!

224
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,018
Whoa! That looks really hard!

225
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,604
Damn! We didn't just
have to hold the pose?

226
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,064
Now, go!

227
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,690
Damn it all!

228
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,067
Takamura-san, you're fast!

229
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,944
This is a piece of cake!

230
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,738
<i>This not only looks really hard,
it is really hard.</i>

231
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,740
Oh, yeah!

232
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,246
<i>Just a little more</i>...

233
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,333
Hey!

234
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:58,045
Damn! I'll be right back!

235
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,381
I've got to catch up to him!

236
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,553
This is a fun exercise, isn't it?

237
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,471
Isn't it hilarious?

238
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,349
Yes, this is really interesting.

239
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,231
It will build up stamina as well as
develop shoulder and back muscles.

240
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,776
It just might be the most
appropriate exercise for Ippo-kun.

241
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,321
But this activity is harder than it looks.

242
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,782
Isn't three rounds from
the very beginning too much?

243
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,495
Time isn't a luxury we have.
The match is in only one month.

244
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,790
My job is to create winning boxers.

245
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,292
What are his odds?

246
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,003
Who knows? Even though
Sendo has a weak guard,

247
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,796
he is a tough boxer.

248
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,091
Unless the kid can put
100% of his power into the match,

249
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,010
it will be difficult to knock him down.

250
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,971
You'll let me accompany
all of you to Osaka, right?

251
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,347
Huh?

252
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,267
It is my job to help
get Ippo-kun's right fist

253
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,562
as close to perfect condition as possible.

254
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,147
Yeah, whatever.

255
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,025
Things are going to get busy!

256
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,985
Well, see you later!

257
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,325
<i>No wonder the kid got all pumped up.</i>

258
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,662
<i>I'm almost there!</i>

259
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,792
-It's your fault!
-What's your problem?!

260
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,835
KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

261
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,545
Sendo-san's video?

262
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,297
If there's a video, I want to watch it.

263
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,092
We should learn his moves
so we can help you practice.

264
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,093
That's true.

265
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,513
Oh, Takamura-san. Can we use the VCR?

266
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,640
Sure!

267
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,976
At any rate, his destructive power
is really impressive.

268
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,854
Anyway, take a look.

269
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,524
He was practically begging
for a fight with Ippo...

270
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,817
So, don't let us down.

271
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,569
I'm telling you, it's awesome!

272
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,701
Yes... He certainly does seem
to have destructive power.

273
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,578
This <i>is</i> amazing.

274
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,704
This isn't it!

275
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,373
What? That's strange. I don't get it!

276
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,209
Forgive me. I saw the tape sitting there,

277
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,920
so I thought it was just a blank
and I recorded over it.

278
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,214
How could you do such a thing?!

279
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,424
Don't get so pissed off!

280
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,885
I noticed halfway through,
so the match is still there.

281
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,432
Thank God.

282
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,018
Sendo is getting hit.

283
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,229
-His guard is too low.
-Yes.

284
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,107
From that position?

285
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,233
Isn't it amazing?

286
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,485
He's a stubborn guy.

287
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:30,197
Still, he sure can throw a good punch
from that awkward position.

288
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,449
That tells us he has
good lower body strength.

289
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,453
Right after this!
His finishing straight right punch!

290
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,956
His amazing punch
blows away the opponent's guard!

291
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,961
<i>Oh, it's amazing!</i>

292
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,798
Not only once, but twice.

293
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,093
Oh, come on. I already messed up,
so why not?

294
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,386
You're too much.

295
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,388
Hey, check all the other tapes.

296
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,223
Got to break all the write-protect tabs.

297
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,687
Ninety-nine...

298
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,814
One hundred!

299
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,859
One...

300
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,028
Two...

301
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,540
Day in, day out,
nothing but resistance training.

302
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,792
Although I guess
he can't use his fist anyway.

303
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,920
But haven't his shoulders
and arms become one size bigger?

304
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,256
Yeah. I wonder what kind of punches
he'll throw

305
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,133
once his fist is completely healed?

306
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,720
I can just see the look on Sendo's face.

307
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,847
{\an8}NANIWA BOXING GYM

308
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,228
All right!

309
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,234
<i>He's out doing roadwork again?
Isn't he practicing too much?</i>

310
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,527
<i>Yeah, that's the problem.</i>

311
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,738
<i>I guess he can't stop himself.</i>

312
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,407
Look what he did to the sandbag and mitts.

313
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,117
This is amazing.

314
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,621
If Makunouchi took a hit like this,
even he would be flat on his back.

315
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,083
Yeah, but Makunouchi's punches
are the equivalent of Sendo's.

316
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,085
If they took each other's best punches,

317
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,629
the match would end instantly.

318
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,511
Thanks, Grandma. I'm going running again.

319
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,430
Hey, it's Rocky! Rocky's goofing off!

320
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,558
What do you mean,
you silly kids?! I am not!

321
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,520
I gave Hiroshi in Division Four
the right straight you taught me

322
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,022
and it got to him. His legs got shaky!

323
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,733
You idiot! I told you
not to use it for fights.

324
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,236
Watch this! Hook!

325
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,279
Forget it. The angle is all wrong.

326
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,573
Hey, you guys sure look bored.

327
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,200
Why not play like the other kids?

328
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,286
But we don't have a video game console.

329
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,957
You told us you'd buy us one when
you become Rookie of the Year, remember?!

330
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,876
Buy us one now!

331
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,086
Buy us one!

332
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,420
Yeah!

333
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,215
-Are you a liar, Rocky?!
-Shut up!

334
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,218
If you guys are that bored,
I'll give you these.

335
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,720
What's this?

336
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,473
Tickets for the Rookie
Championship Tournament.

337
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,267
Aw, man!

338
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,228
It's going to be a real exciting match.

339
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,481
It'll be way more exciting
than a silly old video game.

340
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,192
Well, see you later!

341
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,611
Hey, wait!

342
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,780
Don't follow me, you bratty kids!

343
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,948
You're cramping my style!

344
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,742
Hey, Rocky! You're
the All-Japan champ, hands down!

345
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,035
Thanks!

346
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,453
Want some tangerines?

347
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,830
Sorry, I'm on a diet.

348
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,416
Look, we made a banner for you!

349
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,586
Thanks! But "in the world"
is a little hasty.

350
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,880
KO that Makunouchi!

351
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,215
You're the Rookie of the Year!

352
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,593
We'll all be there
at the match to cheer you on!

353
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,553
Go for it, Rocky!

354
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,346
We're counting on you, Star of Osaka!

355
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,348
<i>Leave it to me!</i>

356
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,479
<i>I feel almost no pain now.</i>

357
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,774
<i>Besides, I can't complain now
that I've come this far.</i>

358
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,986
<i>Sendo-san, I challenge you!</i>

359
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,992
Thanks for coming out all this way.

360
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,702
Thank you for having us.

361
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,412
Nice to see you folks.

362
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,915
Kid, I want you to start warming up.

363
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,124
Do some sparring.

364
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,792
What? I'm going to spar, sir?

365
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,546
This is Komori.
He's an eight-round level lightweight.

366
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,840
-Pleased to meet you.
-Hello.

367
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,927
You might find him a bit overwhelming,

368
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,762
but it's only a warm-up.

369
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,388
I see.

370
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,225
What's wrong? He's a class higher
than you.

371
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,477
Take advantage of your opponent
and go all the way.

372
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,394
Yes, sir.

373
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,646
Worried about your fist?

374
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,397
What? Yes.

375
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,150
Listen, you don't have to hit
with your full power.

376
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,152
Your hand is 70 to 80% recovered.

377
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,987
Use the power you have now.

378
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,199
70% of your punching power will be plenty.

379
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,660
Yes, sir!

380
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,252
<i>Peek-a-Boo style, huh?
His guard looks pretty tight.</i>

381
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,004
<i>The pain is gone.
I need to get my feel back!</i>

382
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,384
What a fast step-in!

383
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,846
<i>What kind of a left was that?!</i>

384
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,641
<i>That kid is good!</i>

385
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,184
He's at his peak.

386
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,561
His speed and power have improved.

387
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,195
<i>This guy is strong!</i>

388
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,906
<i>Good! I'm getting the hang of the rhythm.</i>

389
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,700
<i>Next is double punches from the left!</i>

390
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,702
<i>Right!</i>

391
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,209
<i>Oh, no! I held back my right fist!</i>

392
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,210
<i>My turn!</i>

393
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,673
<i>I'll do it this time!</i>

394
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,807
Hey...

395
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,350
Ow.

396
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,731
-Hasn't his fist...
-...healed yet?

397
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,775
It's healed. But he can't punch with it.

398
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,452
<i>Why?</i>

399
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,251

<i>Every rookie in Eastern

<i>until the winner is determined.</i>

<i>I am about to stand on the stage
that will judge me.</i>

406
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,375
<i>Also, I am looking forward to fighting</i>

407
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,336
<i>the most powerful rookie boxer

408

<i>Until only a short time ago,</i>

409
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,134
<i>this was beyond my wildest dreams!</i>
