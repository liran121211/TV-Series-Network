ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,608
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,097
Ippo, shouldn't you be resting?

4
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,476
-You'll get sick!
-It's okay!

5
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,479
I have to be active in the morning
to feel right!

6
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,439
See you at the boat!

7
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,151
Look at how elated he is.

8
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,118
Sorry for staying so late yesterday.

9
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,454
That's okay. I had a great time.

10
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,207
Doing homework together
makes it go really fast.

11
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,418
-So, come over again sometime.
-Thanks, I will!

12
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,296
This is great!

13
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,217
This must be a heavenly reward
for winning my debut match!

14
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,935
Oh, yeah.

15
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,230
I won!

16
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,319
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot.

17
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,246
<i>The winner, Makunouchi!</i>

18
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,545
It was just like Takamura-san
said it would be.

19
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,090
The applause fell on me like rain.

20
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,885
I'll never forget that!

21
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,433
I'll try to forget that.

22
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,397
BECOMING A BULLY'S BUDDY

23
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,653
I bet everyone's going to be shocked
at these bandages.

24
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,407
Besides, when they find out
I won my pro debut match...

25
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,912
Awesome, Makunouchi! You are awesome!

26
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,663
Way to go, Makunouchi!

27
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,790
I really admire you, Makunouchi-kun!

28
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,044
All right! To celebrate
Makunouchi's first victory...

29
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,632
let's toss him in the air!

30
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,717
Heave-ho!

31
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,053
Congratulations, Makunouchi-kun!

32
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,765
Aw, stop!

33
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,648
But it would be in bad taste
if I sounded boastful.

34
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,359
That's the tricky part.

35
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,947
And you know what Yoko said after that?

36
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,448
Huh?

37
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,702
-What happened? You're all bandaged up!
-Here it comes!

38
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,954
CLEAN-UP DUTY ASSIGNMENTS

39
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,665
What?! You're a professional boxer?!

40
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,625
Yeah, sort of.

41
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,336
I never would have figured you
for a boxer.

42
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,545
Really?

43
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,381
So, you're a pro.

44
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,344
-What are you going to do about college?
-Well...

45
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,805
That must have taken determination.

46
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,556
Yeah.

47
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,809
Are you going to box for a living?

48
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:31,854
Uh, I haven't thought that far ahead yet.

49
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,190
Right now, I'm just devoting myself
to boxing.

50
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,316
Wow.

51
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:40,196
<i>I'll probably be bombarded
with questions all day!</i>

52
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,497
<i>I should've known better.</i>

53
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,376
<i>It's not like I took up boxing
to be popular.</i>

54
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,640
You're eating lunch here? That's pathetic.

55
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,063
Umezawa-kun!

56
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,193
<i>I left my license at home,
and there's nothing else for him to take.</i>

57
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,449
Uh, hi! Did you want to
see me about something?

58
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,617
What's that?

59
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,078
I can't talk to you
unless it's important?!

60
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,121
Uh, no.

61
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,211
-Say...
-Uh, yes?

62
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,049
Come on, Umezawa-san.

63
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,050
Huh?

64
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,178
Umezawa-san!

65
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,601
Say... I heard from a guy in your class...

66
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,980
Well, you know. You won your debut match?

67
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,108
Uh, well... Sort of.

68
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,694
Looks like it's true.

69
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,529
Yeah, but still...

70
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,909
-So...
-So?

71
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,037
How did you win?

72
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,914
Huh? Didn't you come to bully me?

73
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,208
Umezawa-san is asking
you a question! Answer him!

74
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,167
Right!

75
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,128
I did this and...

76
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,089
Are you mocking us?!

77
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,550
We can't understand that!
Explain from the beginning!

78
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,676
Uh, right.

79
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,888
Well, in the first round...

80
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,185
You started to bleed?!

81
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:38,064
You were happy that you didn't lose
by technical knockout?

82
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,526
And you won with right jabs only?

83
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,319
Don't try to sell me that, you bastard!

84
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,948
I bet his opponent was weak.

85
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,533
That's how it was, right, Ippo?

86
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,368
Uh, um...

87
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,789
Do you all like boxing?

88
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,458
Of course we like boxing!

89
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,211
Boxers are at the pinnacle
of manly strength!

90
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,506
All delinquents idolize them!
That's why we think you're...

91
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,632
You idolize me?!

92
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,386
Don't push your luck!

93
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,556
-We don't idolize worms like you!
-Right!

94
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,349
Umezawa-san!

95
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,392
Oh, yeah.

96
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,856
-So, when's your next fight?
-What?

97
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,524
When's your next match?!

98
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,236
Uh, right.

99
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,114
Um, my opponent hasn't been selected yet,

100
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,533
but it'll be at Kourakuen Hall in a month.

101
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,369
Oh. In a month, huh?

102
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,041
At Kourakuen Hall, huh?

103
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,585
In a month, huh?

104
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,549
What was that all about?

105
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,261
You lied to us, Umezawa-san!

106
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,304
Shut up!

107
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,639
Weren't you going to apologize?
You wanted to be friends!

108
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,557
It's too late now!

109
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,100
Umezawa-san!

110
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,810
Oh, shut up!

00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,780
Ah, Fujii-san.

114
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,574
What kind of article is it today?

115
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,826
Oh, it's nothing much.

116
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,079
Are you here to interview me?

117
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,208
Okay, how about this?

118
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,210
A Special Feature Article!

119
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,754
A whopping 20 pages...
"All about Mamoru Takamura!"

120
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,714
You'd be guaranteed double the sales.

121
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,925
-But, it takes more than that...
-Where's Makunouchi?

122
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,594
I brought what the Chief
asked me to bring.

123
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,263
He's in the ring downstairs. Be my guest.

124
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,848
I will, thanks.

125
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,978
Fujii-chan, you must have good footwork
to get behind me so quickly.

126
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,730
Did you say something, Takamura-kun?

127
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,733
-You're just as guilty, Yagi-chan!
-What did I do?!

128
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,443
Hey, come on!

129
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,197
Don't rest after the one-two!
You're forgetting three, the hook!

130
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,323
Working hard, I see.

131
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,909
Your after-punch pull is too slow!

132
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,079
Don't go in straight! Move sideways
or you'll get countered!

133
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,420
He's biting his thumbs.

134
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,756
Oh, I see! It's the peek-a-boo technique.

135
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,510
He says it'll get him into the habit
of keeping his fists under his chin.

136
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,886
That makes sense.

137
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,640
His guard did look awfully loose
at his debut match.

138
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,268
'Peek-a-boo' is
an English expression, right?

139
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:24,564
<i>It's a unique pose the renowned trainer,
Cus D'Amato, taught Mike Tyson.</i>

140
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,983
<i>It involves holding
the gloves firmly to the chin</i>

141
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,278
<i>and peeking through at the opponent.</i>

142
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,281
As expected of Chief Kamogawa.

143
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,784
He came up with a plan of counterattack
in no time flat.

144
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,661
Hook!

145
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,289
Throw a hook immediately
after the one-two!

146
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,042
I appreciate it, Fujii-kun.

147
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,337
No problem. I'm only happy to
accommodate a request from you.

148
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,880
For you.

149
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,633
It's a video of Miyata's match
from the other day.

150
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,427
Watch it for your reference.

151
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,304
Oh! Thank you, sir!

152
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,513
Your next match,

153
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,849
along with the Rookie Tournament,
is coming up, right?

154
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,309

-Uh, yes!

What?

164
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,575
Your opponent is
Yoshio Fujiwara of Maeda Gym.

165
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,703
So far he's got one win and one loss.

166
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,164
The win was by decision.

167
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,832
He's no biggie.

168
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,126
You can't judge by record alone.

169
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,962
In boxing, you never know the result
until the match is over.

170

However, this upcoming match is important

171
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,592
in terms of getting a boost
before the tournament.

172
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,345
You can't afford to lose this!
Don't slack off!

173
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,846
Yes, sir!

174
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,810

00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,385
He'll probably end up
being knocked out anyway.

179
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,388
That's true.
Let's laugh our heads off at him.

180
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,891
But what if he turns out
to be incredibly strong?

181
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:06,892
What?

182
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,061
That's impossible, and you know it.

183
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,938
Yeah, good point.

184
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,357
DYNAMIC GLOVE

185
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,651
-Good! Go for it!
-Keep it up!

186
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,945
-Go for the body, then the head!
-Close in on him!

187
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,864
-Ooh, look at them go!
-Just a little more!

188
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:24,618
Ippo's next. He'll probably last
all of ten seconds!

189
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,744
That's possible.

190
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,788
Yeah, we know how he is.

191
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,127
It's finally Ippo's turn.

192
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,010
Hey, you guys! What are you
getting nervous about?!

193
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,303
Look who's talking!

194
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,559
It's Ippo!

195
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,314
It's really him that came out!

196
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,945
-It's that polite bowing again!
-I love it!

197
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,530
Good luck!

198
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,616
He's an instant hit!

199
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,369
Umezawa-san!

200
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,331
Look at his opponent!

201
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,714
Holy crap! He looks strong in every way!

202
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:22,468
Chief! He has no eyebrows!

203
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,221
Humph! He has the appropriate look,

204
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,973
but you don't box with your face.

205
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,476
Don't let that scare you and step forward.

206
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,562
You'll have no problem
if you make the moves we practiced!

207
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,813
Right!

208
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,441
Like I said, his guard is soft.

209
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,360
Let him have it from the get-go.

210
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,947
You got it! I'll send that baby face
home to his mama with one punch.

211
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,205
It's on!

212
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,847
<i>Here he comes! I'll counterpunch!</i>

213
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,105
<i>Damn, his guard seems firm to me!</i>

214
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,234
<i>That was close.
The peek-a-boo style is working!</i>

215
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,202
<i>What's with this guy's punches?!</i>

216
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,830
<i>It destroyed my guard!</i>

217
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,467
<i>It feels like being hit with a rock!</i>

218
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,720
Good job! You're on a roll!

219
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:51,348
Is this for real?
Ippo's got the upper hand!

220
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,642
Which of you said it'd be over
in ten seconds?!

221
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,185
You, Umezawa-san!

222
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,231
<i>Damn! Don't get carried away!</i>

223
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,575
<i>You're mine!</i>

224
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,040
Hey! He went down!

225
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,292
But didn't that guy just use his head?!

226
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,086
He did! That was definitely a headbutt!

227
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,129
Yeah!

228
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,633
That's dirty! That bastard!

229
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:29,053
That was butting!
Referee, what are you doing?

230
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,137
Keep your eyes open!

231
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,767
It didn't hurt me! I can continue!

232
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,770
<i>What the heck was that?</i>

233
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,651
<i>A four-round match is
a two KO system. I can't fall again!</i>

234
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,282
Ippo's on the offensive!

235
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,243
-He isn't losing the battle!
-Yeah!

236
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,251
<i>It's no good!
I can't win by fighting fair!</i>

237
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,299
Ow!

238
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,301
Hey! That was headbutting, Referee!

239
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,011
Ow...

240
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,722
Watch carefully, Referee!

241
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,057
Watch his head!

242
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,809
Stop!

243
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,768
Huh?

244
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,981
You, watch your head!

245
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,315
What? It was an accident.

246
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,568
His head's so low,
I can't help bumping into it.

247
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,405
Do it again,
and I'll deduct points. Got it?

248
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,614
Yes.

249
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,367
-You watch out too.
-Sure.

250
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,704
<i>The peek-a-boo style involves posing low,</i>

251
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,123
<i>so does that make me easier to bump into?</i>

252
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,629
<i>He did it on purpose!</i>

253
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,174
That piece of crap! What a cheater!

254
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,385
He's not fit to be called a boxer!

255
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,472
Ippo! Take that sucker down!

256
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,391
Yeah! Get him, Ippo!

257
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,729
Good!

258
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,355
Aw, you moron!

259
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,858
There!

260
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,867
Get him!

261
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,871
They hit each other!

262
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,375
It's okay. He's overpowering him!

263
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,464
Good job! It's working!

264
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,133
-Go, go! Finish him!
-Get him there, Ippo!

265
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,306
<i>He's relentless!
I can't get a shot in edgewise!</i>

266
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,308
<i>Damn! I'll do it
as many times as I have to!</i>

267
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,312
He's doing it again! Dodge him, Ippo!

268
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,441
Man! He got it!

269
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,068
That's a penalty, Referee!

270
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,825
<i>If I know a headbutt is coming...</i>

271
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,826
<i>An uppercut?</i>

272
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,496
<i>I can take it!</i>

273
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,582
-Did he block it?!
-No!

274
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,585
Give him another!

275
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,338
Go!

276
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,342
All right!

277
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,237
ROUND ONE
REMAINING TIME 13 SECONDS

278
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,496
The winner, Makunouchi!

279
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,250
He did it!

280
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,004
Ippo, congratulations!

281
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,258
Thank you, sir!

282
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,343
That was brilliant.

283
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,805
-Great job, Kid.
-Ouch!

284
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,767
What's wrong? I didn't hit you <i>that</i> hard.

285
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,563
Look, Yagi-chan! This is impressive!

286
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,982
It's not nice to laugh.

287
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,491
They're having a blast in Ippo's corner.

288
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,868
They have reason to.

289
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,537
That uppercut was intense!

290
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,874
I already knew he'd be victorious
when they hit each other simultaneously.

291
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,333
I knew Ippo would pull through!

292
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,796
Well, I knew we had nothing to worry about
even before the opening gong.

293
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,632
What are you talking about?!
I'm the one who first noticed him!

294
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,639
I noticed him as someone to bully.

295
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,058
We saw his hidden side.

296
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,645
Yeah. That we did.

297
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,148
He's tough.

298
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:01,617
KO TIME: 1R - 2 MINUTES, 50 SECONDS

299
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,163
IPPO MAKUNOUCHI
2 MATCHES, 2 WINS (2 KOS)

00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,916
{\an8}SHOIN HIGH SCHOOLÞ

301
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,465
Want to go somewhere?

302
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,426
-Sure! Where do you want to go?
-I feel like a parfait.

303
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,844
Hey, Ippo.

304
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,516
-Come here for a second.
-Uh... sure.

305
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:48,288
Hey, guys! This is Ippo Makunouchi,
the guy I just told you about!

306
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,415
He's my buddy!

307
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,000
<i>Buddy?</i>

308
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,461
He may not look like it,
but he's a professional boxer!

309
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,671
Huh?

310
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,051
Just yesterday, he won again
with a powerful KO victory!

311
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,470
I wish you guys could've seen it!

312
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,058
You mean, Umezawa-kun...
you came to see the match?

313
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,561
Of course! You're my buddy!

314
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,563
You and I are friends, aren't we?

315
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,280
He was up against a scary-looking guy
with no eyebrows,

316
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,324
a no-good cheater who screwed
the rules when he started losing.

317
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,702
The guy made this eerie smirk back
in his own corner.

318
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,745
He starts going
full-blast in the first round, but...

319
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,999
-But you should have seen Ippo...
<i>-I don't know how to feel.</i>

320
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:37,504
<i>But I'm glad there's someone at my school
who's this excited about my victory.</i>

321
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,965
We all thought he was
about to get a KO out of the guy,

322
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,926
but that's when the cheating bastard
pulls a headbutt!

323
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,221
But this is where Ippo shows
his amazing move!

324
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,764
Ow!

325
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,603
<i>It... hurts, but I'm happy!</i>

326
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,567
That's when Ippo's left uppercut exploded!

327
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,696
Then, another one!
A killer right uppercut!

328
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,408
The headbutting bastard
finds himself flat on his ass!

329
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,870
The referee starts counting
and we all count with him.

330
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,249
The guy doesn't even twitch.

331
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,497
<i>Ducking. To lean the upper body
forward almost into a squat</i>

332
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,374
<i>to exchange blows with your opponent.</i>

333
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,628
<i>If you can't do it, you're down on the mat
and the tournament is over.</i>

334
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,590
<i>Then the dream will end, a dream
and promises will go unfulfilled!</i>

335
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,135
<i>That's why I'll give it all I've got!</i>

336
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,388
<i>All I can do now is not give up!</i>

337
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,393
<i>Next time, "The Eastern Japan
Rookie Championship Tournament Begins."</i>
