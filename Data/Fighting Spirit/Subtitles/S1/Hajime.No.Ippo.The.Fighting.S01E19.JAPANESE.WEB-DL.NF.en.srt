00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:14,431
ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,692
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,076
<i>Not good. This is not good at all.</i>

4
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,212
We seem to have completely fallen
for Kobashi's strategy.

5
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,421
Kobashi's strategy?

6
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,388
Kobashi's style looks like
he's running away,

7
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,974
but it is a shrewd strategy
to confuse Ippo's pace

8
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,268
and drain stamina out of him.

9
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:28,148
But there's no way Ippo's energy level
goes down in only two rounds.

10
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,774
Only if this was an ordinary match.

11
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,527
But Kobashi had Ippo by the short hairs.

12
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,780
Even if he has stamina,
if he keeps the opponent's pace,

13
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,616
the level of exhaustion
will accumulate twice as fast.

14
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,577
The kid is a straightforward fighter.

15
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,870
When he loses stamina,

16
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,414
it's easy for the opponent to dodge him.

17
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,626
That's perfect if someone's
trying to win by points.

18
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,010
<i>Damn it!</i>

19
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,803
<i>Good!</i>

20
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,306
Hey, not again!

21
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,265
Come on!

22
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,808
Are you going to box or what?!

23
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,059
Start fighting!

24
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,311
Hey, exchange some punches!

25
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,814
Good. You're doing well.
Don't worry about what others say.

26
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,693
So, they were aiming to win
by decision from the beginning.

27
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,825
<i>I couldn't catch him again.</i>

28
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:26,831
DREAM OF A KO

29
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:34,464
Good job. You won the second round
just like the first round.

30
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,840
You're leading by two points.

31
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,968
So I'm leading by points.

32
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,554
Good...

33
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,224
<i>What high concentration.</i>

34
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,519
<i>It's highly risky to go for points while
dodging Makunouchi's powerful punches.</i>

35
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,314
<i>He must be under extreme pressure.</i>

36
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,066
Two more rounds to go.

37
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,859
It's tough, but just hang in there.

38
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,818
I know.

39
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,114
But Makunouchi-kun is
more exhausted than I am.

40
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,825
He must have used up his stamina by now.

41
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,245
For the remaining rounds,

42
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,830
I'll just stick to "safe driving"
and pull away till the end.

43
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,832
If I can do that...

44
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,335
Ippo, how's your exhaustion level?

45
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,129
I'm all right.

46
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,800
If I connect just once,
I won't even feel tired at all.

47
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,635
Way to go.

48
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:24,138
Kobashi's tired too.
Keep punching aggressively head-on.

49
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:28,059
But his guard is solid...

50
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,188
<i>The "Cross Block" Kobashi's using
could even absorb</i>

51
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,024
<i>heavyweight level punches.
Straightforward tactics won't do much.</i>

52
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,734
Look for space

53
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,528
and whale in from both directions.

54
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,071
In particular, aim for his body.

55
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,031
Punch higher and cut in from the bottom.

56
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,908
Yes, sir!

57
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,535
Seconds out.

58
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,081
Do you think that was enough instruction?

59
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,543
If Ippo is so exhausted, don't
you want to let him rest in this round?

60
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,712
No. This is a four-round match.

61
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,798
We have only two more rounds...
six minutes, left.

62
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,134
It's obvious that he'll exhaust
more stamina,

63
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,261
but he has to keep punching aggressively.

64
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,721
Give Kobashi a chance to relax,

65
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,307
and the worse the situation
will get for the kid.

66
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,227
We're counting on you, Ippo.
Catch him in this round!

67
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,022
Round Three.

68
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,482
Go, Makunouchi!

69
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,192
Annihilate this wimp!

70
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,528
Exchange punches, or it's not boxing!

71
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,034
From Ippo's point of view,
Kobashi is taking an oblique stance.

72
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,535
There aren't many spots to aim.

73
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,955
Besides, Kobashi's left hand
is close to Ippo.

74
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,042
And that just might be
an ideal pose to go for points.

75
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,050
<i>The Cross Block is certainly solid,
but I can see a space.</i>

76
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,302
<i>I'll throw some punches higher and</i>...

77
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,304
{\an8}<i>when the guard goes up</i>...

78
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,555
<i>from down here</i>...

79
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,931
Right there!

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,520
He even read Ippo's combination pattern!

81
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,481
How extensively did he study Ippo?!

82
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,025
<i>His punches are still strong,</i>

83
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,319
<i>but his speed of dashes
and barrages is slowing down.</i>

84
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,237
<i>I can deal with him until the end!</i>

85
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,910
<i>If I focus on dodging,</i>

86
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,162
<i>I'll maintain the two-point lead
and I will win!</i>

87
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,589
Not good. Ippo is not
keeping up with him. He is too tired.

88
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,050
His leg muscles were stiff.

89
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,718
How come you're looking run down?!

90
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,720
What did you learn at the training camp?

91
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,892
Rather... Kobashi's punches are working.

92
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,978
They don't have damaging power,
but Ippo received way too many of them.

93
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,481
Exhaustion and damage are accumulating.

94
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,484
The third round is over!

95
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,490
He got us!

96
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,492
Even if they were even in this round,

97
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,911
Kobashi is still leading by two points!

98
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,746
We can't win by points.

99
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,916
There's no choice but to knock him down.

100
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,252
Damn!

101
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,254
I can't get deflated like this!

102
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,256
The kid is the one fighting out there!

103
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,261
You seem to be extremely exhausted.

104
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,555
But if he gets clear away
in the final round,

105
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,890
you're not going to win by points.

106
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,517
Just as Kobashi has planned.

107
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,104
That's not acceptable! I'm going to do it!

108
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,939
I won't give up until the end!

109
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,275
Sure! I haven't given up either!

110
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,527
-Yagi-san! Give me the bucket!
-Here.

111
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,613
What?

112
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,583
How's that? When you cool down
your "thing,"

113
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,334
you can cool down your entire body.

114
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,044
Don't you feel better now?

115
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,839
Yes. The burning sensation is gone.

116
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,592
See? But your "thing" is too big.

117
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,261
-I needed more ice.
-Huh?

118
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,597
Now, it's the final round.

119
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,266
Be extra careful and watch out
for a devastating single punch.

120
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,809
So far, it's just as I imagined.

121
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,478
It's almost scary.

122
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,938
I'll just keep believing in my own boxing

123
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,149
and stick to my tactics.

124
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,693
That's right. Just keep up the good work.

125
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,197
After three minutes,
it'll be my hand that will be raised.

126
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,115
Uh... sure.

127
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,700
Seconds out.

128
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:13,910
Listen.

129
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,662
The only way out is
a come-from-behind victory with a KO.

130
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,623
Go knock him down in three minutes!

131
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,790
Yes, sir!

132
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,295
<i>I'm not going to give up
until the very last swing.</i>

133
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,465
<i>I'll keep guarding for
three more minutes. Then I'll win!</i>

134
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,468
<i>We have no choice but to
count on the kid's persistence.</i>

135
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,970
<i>Do your best, Kobashi.</i>

136
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,139
<i>Now, here I come!</i>

137
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,057
Huh?

138
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,935
As expected, he'll concentrate on defense!

139
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,686
Kid, go!

140
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,688
<i>I have to exchange punches!</i>

141
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,648
<i>One-two?</i>

142
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,111
<i>An uppercut after dodging a hook!</i>

143
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,780
<i>He used it in the match with Ozuma!</i>

144
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,616
<i>His punches are still strong.
As planned originally,</i>

145
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,618
<i>I need to keep my focus on defense.</i>

146
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,119
<i>I need to go in deep!</i>

147
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,454
<i>I'm not going to let you in!</i>

148
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,289
Ippo's allowing the distance too easily!

149
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,042
<i>Good job. Victory is
just around the corner.</i>

150
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,212
The guy in the blue corner's
doing a great job, but he won't win.

151
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,547
It'll be decided by points.

152
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,886
<i>What an amazing spirit!</i>

153
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,180
<i>He's still strong.
He should be out of power by now.</i>

154
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,433
<i>However</i>...

155
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,687
<i>Your guard is wide open!</i>

156
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,654
<i>What?</i>

157
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,661
Not good!

158
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,871
Whoa! He threw a perfect one-two
and it connected!

159
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,591
{\an8}<i>What... was that?</i>

160
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,676
<i>What did I feel?</i>

161
00:09:55,344 --> 00:10:00,600
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

162
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,232
<i>What?</i>

163
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,237
Not good!

164
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:23,581
{\an8}<i>What... was that?</i>

165
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,249
<i>What did I feel?</i>

166
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,640
<i>It's working.</i>

167
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,685
<i>I've never felt such a solid response,</i>

168
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,146
<i>even in a sparring session.</i>

169
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,106
<i>Now must be the chance.</i>

170
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,112
<i>No. I should stick to my plan.</i>

171
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,448
<i>I'm already winning by points.
I'll stick to my plan.</i>

172
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,415
<i>It is working.</i>

173
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,211
Can't you support your punch
with your hip a little better?

174
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,546
With the way you're punching,
you'll never get a KO.

175
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,593
<i>KO?</i>

176
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,556
<i>Now could be the chance.</i>

177
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,027
<i>Now's the chance! I can knock him down!</i>

178
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,119
<i>A little more... till I score a KO!</i>

179
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,666
<i>Fall down!</i>

180
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,793
<i>Kobashi</i>...

181
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,170
<i>Fall down!</i>

182
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,551
<i>I did it! He's going to fall!</i>

183
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:04,807
<i>His body!</i>

184
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,857
Whoa! He struck back!

185
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,320
<i>He still had power left?</i>

186
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,489
<i>I connected</i>...

187
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,408
<i>for the first time... it was a clean hit.</i>

188
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,327
<i>Ippo is still suffering
from the earlier one-two punch.</i>

189
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,329
<i>I wonder how much longer he'll last.</i>

190
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,540
<i>What shall I do?</i>

191
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,001
<i>Should I wait for the victory by points?</i>

192
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,837
<i>But I'm so close.</i>

193
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,547
Kobashi.

194
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,092
<i>I'm so close.</i>

195
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,848
<i>I'm so close to winning with a KO.</i>

196
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,851
Don't do it, Kobashi! Keep away from him!

197
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,855
Don't exchange punches
with Makunouchi! Kobashi!

198
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,401
Kobashi!

199
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,198
<i>My right hand can still feel it.</i>

200
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,162
<i>That solid response
when I connected perfectly!</i>

201
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,290
<i>I'm so close to nailing him down.</i>

202
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,417
<i>I'm gonna win with a KO! With a KO!</i>

203
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,170
<i>As long as my body lasts,
I'll keep punching!</i>

204
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,133
Good job, Kobashi! Go for it!

205
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,385
Go! Both of you!

206
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,888
<i>Kobashi.</i>

207
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,641
Kid! Exchanging punches
is <i>your</i> cup of tea!

208
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,392
It's your chance now! Go all the way!

209
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,647
<i>I'm going to win with a KO!</i>

210
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,650
<i>Ugh... I can't let him keep up with this.</i>

211
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,401
Use your fist, Ippo!

212
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,278
You can't win unless you knock him down!

213
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:45,241
Hey, haven't we seen
a similar situation before?

214
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,369
What? Ah! You mean "Operation Turtle!"

215
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,497
It's the same scenario as
the second time he sparred with Miyata.

216
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,167
At that time, he also waited out
until Miyata's barrage of punches stopped.

217
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,419
Then he's aiming for a single chance?

218
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,129
<i>The chance will come.</i>

219
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,923
<i>There will be a flash
of an unguarded moment!</i>

220
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,676
<i>I'll win with a KO!</i>

221
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,429
<i>It's unbelievable that Kobashi is
showing fighting spirit so aggressively.</i>

222
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,185
Go, Kobashi! Give him the fatal blow!

223
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,437
<i>One more punch!
It'll be over with one more blow!</i>

224
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,651
<i>How do you like this?</i>

225
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,652
<i>A big swing!</i>

226
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,630
It's a down! He reversed it with a KO!

227
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,798
<i>I did it.</i>

228
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,135
-He did it!
-He sure did!

229
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,806
Kobashi.

230
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,646
Not yet! Stand up, Kobashi!
If you get up, you'll win!

231
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,065
{\an8}REMAINING TIME

232
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,651
There are 13 seconds left.

233
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,069
If he gets up, it'll go to decision.

234
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,655
If it goes to decision,
the kid's going to lose.

235
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,994
Stand up, Kobashi! Stand up!

236
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,164
You gave up on your style of boxing
and exchanged punches so courageously!

237
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,125
You have to win! Get up to win!

238
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,878
<i>Don't get up.</i>

239
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,181
<i>I'm gonna knock him down... so I can win.</i>

240
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:38,187
<i>I'm gonna get up... so I can win.</i>

241
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,400
Hang in there, Kobashi! A little longer!

242
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,904
<i>I'm gonna knock him down so I can win</i>...

243
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,407
<i>I'll win with a KO!</i>

244
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,159
Whoa! He got up!

245
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,953
What a fighting spirit!

246
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,704
Kobashi...

247
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,206
What the...?

248
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,213
<i>I'm gonna win...</i>

249
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,841
<i>with a KO</i>...

250
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,315
The winner... Makunouchi!

251
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,817
Finally, the winner is decided!

252
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,360
Great job, Makunouchi!

253
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,987
You did a good job, too, Kobashi!

254
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,155
As I expected, Kobashi couldn't get up.

255
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,615
Kobashi!

256
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,161
You did It, Ippo!

257
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,914
You put me on pins and needles!

258
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,416
I'm so sorry.

259
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,835
{\an8}REMAINING TIME

260
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,963
I had only two seconds left.

261
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:50,300
Indeed, boxing is absolutely unpredictable
until the last second.

262
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,350
Kobashi-san.

263
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,394
Great fight, Kobashi!

264
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,312
Keep up the good work!

265
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,440
Awesome, Makunouchi!

266
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,275
You're so strong!

267
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,280
KO TIME: 4R, 2 MINUTES, 58 SECONDS

268
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,948
IPPO MAKUNOUCHI

269
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,076
{\an8}EASTERN JAPAN ROOKIE CHAMPIONSHIP
TOURNAMENT A NARROW THIRD VICTORY!

270
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,585
Yasuda-san.

271
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,256
What's wrong? Where does it hurt?

272
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,552
I was so dumb, wasn't I?

273
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,389
If I had stuck to my original plan,

274
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,683
I might have been able to win.

275
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,979
I knew better!

276
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,607
I knew that I had no chance of winning

277
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,111
if I exchanged punches with him head-on.

278
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,450
Because such a perfect one connected,

279
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,036
I daydreamed for a little while.

280
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,958
Daydreamed, huh?

281
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,255
That one-two punch in the final round
was certainly impressive.

282
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,384
Yasuda-san...

283
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,386
Fine, isn't it?

284
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,139
If it's a wonderful dream,
let's have it over and over again.

285
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,475
Yasuda-san...

286
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,978
I look forward to
the daydream becoming reality.

287
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,568
I'll do my best.

288
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,986
I'll do my best.

289
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,491
Takamura-san, I won.

290
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,414
Now it's my turn.

291
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,583
Yes!

292
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,712
You knucklehead! You received way
too many punches!

293
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,133
Such a lame boxer is not qualified
to watch my match!

294
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,969
-Stay in this room!
-Please let me watch it!

295
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,972
I said no! Watching it on the monitor
is more than enough for you!

296
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,265
But...

297
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,600
Uh... huh?

298
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,477
See? Didn't I tell you?

299
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,021
Don't worry. We'll watch
his match closely.

300
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,982
So you can die with peace of mind!

301
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,608
That's not nice!

302
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,404
Yajima!

303
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,491
{\an8}YAJIMA

304
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:23,495
Yajima!

305
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,914
Now it's about to begin.

306
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,500
By the way, the champion
has a large crowd cheering for him.

307
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,169
We need to cheer loudly too.

308
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,545
Of course!

309
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,088
Man! They're too noisy!

310
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,591
What's wrong? You're irritated?
It's not like you.

311
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,551
Are you nervous or what?

312
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,344
Why should I be?!

313
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,351
{\an8}Don't look at it so longingly.

314
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,979
{\an8}-I'll get it for you soon enough.
-Uh, sure...

315
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,480
Seconds out!

316
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,652
<i>Until I met the old man,</i>

317
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,822
<i>I had never even dreamed
of becoming a boxing champion.</i>

318
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,868
<i>I've owe so much to
the old man since then!</i>

319
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,870
<i>Now, the Japan Middleweight Class
Title match.</i>

320
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,247
I can't believe
I don't get to see the match

321
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,875
in which Takamura-san is
going to become a champion.

322
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,169
<i>The bell is about to ring.</i>

323
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,671
<i>I want to see it.</i>

324
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,465
<i>Now, it has begun!</i>

325
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,636
<i>Wow! The challenger went forward very
aggressively as soon as the bell rang!</i>

326
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,638
<i>Takamura's strike caught
the champ off guard!</i>

327
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,139
<i>He's stuck against the rope.</i>

328
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,058
<i>Whoa! The champion's knees are shaky!</i>

329
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,643
<i>I really have to see it in person!</i>

330
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,521
<i>What? It's already over?</i>

331
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,901
How is it going?

332
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,571
Whoa! The champion's
spectacular counterpunch!

333
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,367
The invincible challenger's
knee has finally touched the floor!

334
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,578
In the 9th pro match,
it's the first, humiliating down!

335
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,831
Do you understand now, young man?
The champion is a boxer of higher caliber!

336
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,585
I can't believe
Takamura-san allowed a down.

337
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:59,258
A feint usually never tricks you!

338
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,677
You <i>are</i> under a lot of pressure!

339
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,179
The countdown keeps going.
Can Takamura stand up?

340
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,430
Four!

341
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,433
Yajima!

342
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,394
<i>Damn it!</i>

343
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:17,067
No! I don't want you to lose!

344
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,903
Yajima!

345
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,908
Stand up, Takamura-san!

346
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,452
I don't want you to lose!

347
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,873
<i>Lose? Did you say I lose...?!</i>

348
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,418
Please stand up, Takamura-san!

349
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,336
If you don't become a champion,

350
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,922
we're not gonna have any dreams or hopes!
