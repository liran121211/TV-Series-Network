HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,084
How's your right fist, Makunouchi-kun?

4
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,465
You're the hopeful who's
been blowing away the competition.

5
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,841
Of course I know about you.

6
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:46,856
THE CHAMP AND I

7
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,236
<i>This is the Featherweight Champion
of Japan</i>...

8
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,862
<i>Eiji Date-san!</i>

9
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,461
Oops, I forgot
you can't use your right hand.

10
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,630
Uh...

11
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,550
Thanks.

12
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,392
Excuse me?

13
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,938
Don't be so stiff, boy!

14
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,148
Uh, I...

15
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,191
Hey! It's you, old guy.

16
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,196
Hey, Takamura! Don't call me old!
I'm only 28.

17
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,076
Don't act like a big shot
after teasing one of our boxers.

18
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,745
Well, I didn't mean to,

19
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,540
but he got so nervous,
I couldn't help myself.

20
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,500
This little guy sure is cute.

21
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,711
Anyway, what brings you here today?

22
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,255
Oh, I was called in
as a guest commentator.

23
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,507
Guest?! Like you're such a hot commodity.

24
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,135
I don't think I fit the role, either.

25
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,138
That explains the disgusting tie.

26
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,099
Don't mock my wife's fashion sense!

27
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:08,229
More importantly, they say
your opponent is tough stuff.

28
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,107
Yeah. Don't say that.

29
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,734
I'm nervous to a degree.

30
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:18,698
You idiot! Would a nervous guy
be loitering around in a place like this?

31
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,451
I haven't decided how to
slaughter him yet, that's all!

32
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,580
Um, I didn't know you were acquainted.

33
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:29,542
Yeah. I bumped into him at
last year's commissioner sponsor party.

34
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,462
I wanted to know
who the old guy with the evil eyes was.

35
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,047
Stop calling me old!

36
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,008
In the first place,
your glare is worse than mine!

37
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,509
-Oh?!
-Yeah!

38
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,095
Now, now. Champion, we should be going.

39
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,555
Oops, it's that time already.

40
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,060
Make any sloppy moves, I'll give
a commentary you'll never live down.

41
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,812
Oh, yeah. Old guy!

42
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,776
A little while ago,
you called this guy cute, didn't you?

43
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,779
The punches he throws aren't so cute.

44
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,614
Don't say stuff like that, Takamura-san.

45
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,535
Being Rookie of the Year
puts you in 10th place in the rankings.

46
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,706
If you rise in the ranks without a hitch,
it's possible we could fight.

47
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,794
However, I know I put up a front,

48
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,923
but a 28-year-old boxer
is way past his peak.

49
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,425
I don't know if I can wait
that long for you.

50
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,304
I know! I wanted to do
my fine-tuning with someone

51
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,557
who would test my mettle
before my next title match!

52
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,517
Yes?

53
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,478
Once your right fist heals,
drop by my gym to see me.

54
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,481
Later!

55
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,321
Humph. That was a good sob story.

56
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,534
It means that old guy isn't
the type to give up the belt easily.

57
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,035
Is that true?

58
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:50,790
He's one of the few boxers in Japan
capable of tackling the world title.

59
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,292
The world...

60
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,296
<i>Fight against the champion? Me?</i>

61
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,756
You're in the way!

62
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,260
Make way for the number one batter
of Kamogawa Gym!

63
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,180
-Don't disgrace yourself in there.
-You got it.

64
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,266
-Do your best!
-Right!

65
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,272
Aw, no way! It's the last round,
Kimura-san.

66
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,942
It connected! Hey...

67
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,695
This is no time to get sick!
We have to cheer for him!

68
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,447
Right.

69
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,532
Oh, it's come down to judge's decision.

70
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,536
He did it!

71
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,164
I won! Keep it up.

72
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,081
Leave it to me!

73
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,589
-Can you go on?
-I can.

74
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,305
Hit... him... you!

75
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,058
Hey, it hit him.

76
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,852
He did it! Now we have two wins in a row!

77
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:53,895
Yes.

78
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,313
Now it's up to Takamura-san.

79
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,025
Yeah!

80
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,992
All right! That's Takamura-san for you!

81
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,244
I'm really glad all three of them won.

82
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,662
Yeah.

83
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,167
{\an8}Congratulations, everyone!

84
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,837
Did you see my KO reversal?!

85
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,006
That was obviously a lucky punch.

86
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,674
I won, so lay off.

87
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,969
You saw my spectacular form too,
didn't you, Barf-michi?

88
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,137
Yeah.

89
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,598
Huh? What's the matter?

90
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,309
I think the match was too much for him.

91
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,687
I see. I guess he's not used to seeing
our faces like this.

92
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,567
How can I describe it?
Lumps are like medals to a boxer.

93
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,946
If you continue boxing,
you'll learn that for yourself.

94
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,407
Congratulations.

95
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,701
You were really cool.

96
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,203
Yeah!

97
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,913
Thanks for the support.

98
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,375
I don't think having a swollen face
is anything to be proud of.

99
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,130
Since we won today, that means
our ranking will get higher too.

100
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,965
If I'm now ranked 5th...

101
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,926
All we have to do is beat four more,
and we'll be champions too!

102
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,720
Yeah! The belt is
finally coming into view!

103
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,055
Right?

104
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,685
<i>Oh, yeah. They're all fighting
with their eyes on the belt.</i>

105
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,104
You take up our momentum and follow, Ippo!

106
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:22,692
Uh, no. There are still nine boxers
ahead of me.

107
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,318
Fool!

108
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,487
You <i>only</i> have nine boxers ahead of you!

109
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,157
You could have a title match
on your hands within the year!

110
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,743
-Have a little ambition, would you?!
-Yes, sir.

<i>in the Rookie of the Year fight.</i>

119
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,312
<i>Sendo-san's punches were intense.</i>

120
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,816
<i>And to be honest,
I couldn't see Mashiba-san's flicker jabs.</i>

121
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,321
<i>And Miyata-kun's speed is
something to be reckoned with.</i>

122
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:13,117
<i>But a champion probably
has to rise above all those things.</i>

123

<i>Rise above? Surely there aren't
many featherweight boxers</i>

<i>who can punch like Sendo-san.</i>

125

<i>And as for speed,
I know that I'm totally outranked,</i>

126

<i>but I wonder just how much
of a gap in skill</i>

-Watch me.

But I... I think I really can't...

145
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,620
Can't? You really can't what?

146
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,583
You've gotten a lot better. Keep trying!

when you first joined the gym.

150
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,886
That's not the problem here!

151
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,223
What are you doing, laughing at him
when he's doing his best?!

152
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,391
Whoa, he defended him!

153
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,517

That's suspicious.

It'll slow us down, so ignore them.

00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,473
Kid!

176
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,433
-One, two!
-Yes, sir!

177
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,689
-Right punch!
-Right!

178
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,651
Left!

179
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,736
Left-right barrage!

180
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:02,555
Yes. Those were pretty solid impacts
for such a long absence.

181
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,639
Thank you, sir!

182
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,476
<i>I just got through
with the bad boys' matches,</i>

183
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,645
<i>but it's going to get busy again.</i>

184
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,439
-Kid!
-Yes, sir!

185
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:15,109
You just got a sparring offer
from Nakadai Gym.

186
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:19,613
It was a direct request from Eiji Date
to borrow Ippo Makunouchi.

187
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,865
Direct request...

188
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,284
Your sparring session is in three days.

189
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,661
Go use his services
to your heart's content!

190
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,960
<i>I spar with Date-san in three days.</i>

191
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:41,469
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

192
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,225
Don't be so nervous.

193
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,977
Right.

194
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,313
The old guy had sudden business
to attend to,

195
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,565
but with me as your escort,
you've nothing to fear.

196
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,233
Yes, it's very encouraging.

197
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,865
All right, let's go show him who's boss!

198
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,784
What day is today?

199
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,036
The 30th.

200
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,040
-Oh, no!
-What's wrong?

201
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,919
-I have a date today.
-Huh?

202
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,003
-Let's hurry.
-Huh?!

203
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:20,090
-Do your best!
-Wait a minute!

204
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,676
Uh, Takamura-san!

205
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,804
What'll I do?

206
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,017
Yamada-kun!

207
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,062
NAKADAI BOXING GYM

208
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,315
Thank you for coming.
I'm the chief, Nakadai.

209
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,984
Pleased to meet you.
I'm looking forward to sparring.

210
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,570
Couldn't Kamogawa-san come as your escort?

211
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,614
He always did have a hands-off policy.

212
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,532
Yeah.

213
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,284
-Well, why don't you start getting ready?
-Sure.

214
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,461
<i>I'm so nervous.</i>

215
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,047
You're getting a lot of attention, sempai.

216
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,967
Please don't tell me things like that.

217
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,552
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,514
<i>I need to concentrate.</i>

219
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,697
I see why Date
would personally request him.

220
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,537
Hey, you're here!

221
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,539
Yes, pleased to be of service to you, sir.

222
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,041
Well, let's get to it, then.

223
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,300
That's unusual shadow boxing.

224
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,343
He's using his elbows an awful lot.

225
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,096
Sempai?

226
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,598
Good.

227
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,934
He only moved them lightly,
but his shoulders,

228
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,061
elbows, and even
his wrists are perfectly fluid.

229
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,815
Date-san is a master of
the corkscrew blow.

230
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,317
Corkscrew blow?

231
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,322
You spar for three rounds.

232
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,783
For Date, this will be
his final adjustment before the match.

233
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,202
Take him full-on for
the full nine minutes.

234
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,080
Yes, sir. Um, what about headgear?

235
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:19,084
Oh, that. Don't worry.
I prefer not to wear it.

236
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,169
I mentioned it before.

237
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,088
I'm growing old. I have no more time.

238
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,091
If I act the slightest bit weak,
I can't maintain my tension.

239
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,053
Come on, don't be so standoffish.

240
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,597
-Hit me without holding back.
-Right.

241
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,435
<i>How should I go about fighting him?</i>

242
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,396
<i>I could really use
Takamura-san's help right now.</i>

243
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:48,656
<i>Strategy or not,
there is no variation to the way I fight.</i>

244
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,367
<i>I'll stick close
and exchange punches as usual!</i>

245
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,828
Okay, ring the bell!

246
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,788
Right!

247
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,174
All right.

248
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,131
<i>I've never felt this kind
of pressure before.</i>

249
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,303
<i>It's different from
Mashiba-san or Sendo-san.</i>

250
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,389
<i>The pressure is heavier.</i>

251
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,402
<i>What the heck was
I just standing there for?!</i>

252
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,906
<i>He's fast! I can't miss
his movement even for a second!</i>

253
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,492
<i>Left!</i>

254
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,162
<i>I got it backwards! A right is coming!</i>

255
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,748
<i>I controlled it! Return a left!</i>

256
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,584
<i>He shook it off by force!</i>

257
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,758
<i>I thought that the boxing of a champion</i>...

258
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,010
<i>would be smarter!</i>

259
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,513
<i>I never expected it to be this rough!</i>

260
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,807
Date-san set a trap for him.

261
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,060
He's completely leading the match.

262
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,021
He never gives up the pace,
even in a sparring match.

263
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,773
That's from experience.

264
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,028
<i>I have to lash out!
He's within striking distance!</i>

265
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,947
<i>I have to lash out!</i>

266
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,702
His engine finally turned over.

267
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,957
<i>I see. That's a good punch.</i>

268
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,338
<i>Even when he's hit, he punches right back.</i>

269
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,964
<i>He's got a good heart too.</i>

270
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,762
Whoa, Date lost his balance!

271
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,222
He had his guard up just now.

272
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,477
<i>Oh, no! He won't be able to dodge that!</i>

273
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,732
Whoa there, break time.

274
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,281
<i>The bell already?
I was so absorbed, I couldn't tell.</i>

275
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,744
Damn, it's hell taking on a young guy!

276
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,831
But I wouldn't have it any other way.

277
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,546
What's wrong? Sure he didn't get
the upper hand?

278
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,923
Nah, he's just so spunky.

279
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,259
I'm jealous of the young.

280
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,803
He probably has power to spare.

281
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,304
Yeah, it's really something.

282
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,390
His speed isn't average, either.

283
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,518
With some experience,
he would make a fine boxer.

284
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,397
That's true. If I'm not careful,
he'll knock me off my feet.

285
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,898
For sure.

286
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,026
Want to test it?

287
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:18,448
He has punches, he has speed.
He never runs out of energy.

288
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,285
He's a type very similar
to my next opponent.

289
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,537
He's the perfect test candidate. Yeah.

290
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,665
<i>He's holding back something, I know it.</i>

291
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,793
That was so close.

292
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,171
You're probably going to KO him
at this rate.

293
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,674
What are you talking about?!

294
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,926
Date-san isn't seriously fighting yet.

295
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,720
He hasn't used his corkscrew.

296
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,180
What? Really?

297
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,433
Yeah. And that smile he made...

298
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,814
Didn't he get the upper hand on Date-san?

299
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,317
Yeah. Makunouchi isn't someone
to be trifled with.

300
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,569
Hey, where are your eyes?

301
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,780
Date-san lets his opponents attack
to observe their moves.

302
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,866
It's his usual trick.

303
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,659
Yeah.

304
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,995
Okita's really uptight.

305
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,997
He's in the same weight class as Date-san,

306
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,082
waiting for his shot at the title.

307
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:14,087
If the guy he's trying to beat
has a hard time fighting a rookie...

308
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:22,137
<i>Interesting. The side-to-side move
he used in the Mashiba fight.</i>

309
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:26,433
<i>Good weaving. The corkscrew
doesn't work for barrages.</i>

310
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,603
<i>If he moves around that fast,
he'll be a hard target.</i>

311
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,110
<i>Corkscrew?!</i>

312
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,906
<i>He's exercising
an abnormal amount of caution!</i>

313
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,617
<i>I shouldn't have let him see me shadowbox.</i>

314
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,915
<i>Still, it wouldn't be much of a test
if I didn't use it!</i>

315
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,128
<i>For all that movement,
he still cornered me easily!</i>

316
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,382
<i>See that? This is the difference
in your careers.</i>

317
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,429
<i>He's taking aim.
I have to get out of the corner.</i>

318
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:06,932
<i>I don't think so!</i>

319
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,729
<i>Oh, no!</i>

320
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,731
<i>Got you!</i>

321
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,233
<i>It's the corkscrew!</i>

322
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,778
<i>Block...</i>

323
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,158
<i>I got hit!</i>

324
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,747
<i>His left follow-up is coming!
I have to raise my guard!</i>

325
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,459
<i>I must raise my guard!</i>

326
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,754
<i>What am I doing? I have to raise my guard!</i>

327
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,512
Sempai.

328
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,391
<i>What? What happened?</i>

329
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,268
<i>It's almost like</i>

330
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,106
<i>I'm frozen in time.</i>

331
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,117
<i>What happened?</i>

<i>The corkscrew blow.</i>

334
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,948
<i>By striking out while twisting your fist,</i>

335
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,409
<i>this punch produces
definitive destructive and piercing power.</i>

336
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:35,705
<i>However, it takes a high degree of
technical skill and training to do this.</i>

337
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,375
<i>Incredible.</i>

338
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,961
<i>No matter how many times I fall,
I don't want it to end.</i>

339
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,297
<i>I want to know more of the strengths
the champion has in his arsenal!</i>
