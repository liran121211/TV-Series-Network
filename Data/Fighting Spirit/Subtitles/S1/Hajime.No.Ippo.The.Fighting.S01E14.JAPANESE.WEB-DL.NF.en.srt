<i>Once again, it is time for this year's
Rookie King Championship Tournament.</i>

5
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:40,375
<i>This tournament has produced
many promising boxers,</i>

6
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,041
<i>and any boxer who wins this title</i>

7
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,125
<i>will most likely go on to become
a world champion.</i>

8
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,791
<i>The level of competition in Eastern Japan
is extremely high this year.</i>

9
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,125
<i>Hayami, champ of the Interscholastic...</i>

10
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,458
<i>Yoshida, the runner-up...</i>

11
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,416
<i>Mashiba, who fights
with a high-level of perfection...</i>

12
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,541
<i>and Miyata, who is widely viewed
as a boxing prodigy.</i>

13
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,041
<i>No matter who wins,</i>

14
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:04,291
<i>he will surely make the future world
of boxing his stage.</i>

15
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:09,708
<i>My own attention is on Makunouchi
of the Kamogawa Boxing Gym.</i>

16
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,458
<i>He has two wins out of two with two KOs.</i>

17
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:17,291
<i>His dynamic punching style fills
this reporter with big dreams.</i>

18
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,000
<i>His first match opponent is Jason Ozuma.</i>

19
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,333
<i>I look forward to the exciting
clash of sharp hooks and punches.</i>

20
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,708
<i>These are battles of
rookies striving to reach the top.</i>

21
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:30,291
<i>There may be a future boxing champion
among them.</i>

22
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,375
We can't use this, Fujii.
Write about Hayami or Miyata.

23
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,791
Who's Makunouchi?!

24
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,833
This is why I can't leave
the opening article to you.

25
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,541
I knew he'd say that.

26
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:50,541
POWERFUL ARMS! HOOK VS. UPPERCUT!

KOURAKUEN HALL

28
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,833
Makunouchi, you are within
the featherweight class weight limit.

29
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,541
Next, Ozuma. Step up.

30
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,041
<i>He has a wiry physique.</i>

31
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,666
<i>His muscles look like springs.</i>

32
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,083
Ozuma has passed the weight limit.

33
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,208
Kamogawa-san,
I'm looking forward to the match.

34
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,333
Same here.

35
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,833
<i>I'm not comfortable
having my weight checked.</i>

36
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,666
<i>Everybody glares at me.</i>

37
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,833
Hi, Makunouchi-san!

38
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,333
Uh... What?

39
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,750
I hear that you are a strong fighter.

40
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,833
I will give our match my very best.
Let's have a good fight!

41
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,125
Huh?

42
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,708
You know, as in first step,
second step. "Ippo."

43
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,291
-Is this embarrassing or what?
-I agree.

44
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,291
You idiot.

45
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,708
What do you mean, "Yes, yes!"

46
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,416
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,416
It's just that all my opponents
so far tried to intimidate me,

48
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,791
so I was surprised by his friendliness.

49
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,291
Yeah, but don't you think
Ozuma-san is a gentleman?

50
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,291
All right, I'll give it my best too!

51
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,791
He's as cheerful as ever.

52
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:05,791
But don't you think
he's at his most relaxed yet?

53
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,333
Yes. He's at his best condition.

54
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,833
The question is, how far will he show
the result of his intensive training?

56
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,125
Thank you for the meal!

57
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,416
-Hey, Mom?
-Hmm?

58
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,375
Can you make it to watch me tomorrow?

59
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,666
I don't want to go out
only to see you get hit.

60
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,833
I can't bring myself to go.

61
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,666
I'll come see you
when you can promise me you won't get hit.

62
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,875
<i>That's impossible.</i>

63
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,500
Whether you win or lose,
don't get hurt, okay?

64
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:53,875
Here you go.

65
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,291
Okay!

{\an8}SAKURA PARK

67
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,666
<i>I'll dodge his hook...</i>

68
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,958
<i>and deliver a short uppercut to his chest!</i>

69
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,625
<i>That will trigger a barrage of punches.</i>

70
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,916
That's what I'm aiming for!

71
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:48,500
{\an8}KOURAKUEN HALL

00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,750
ROOM D

73
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:57,500
Listen, apparently Makunouchi
is a typical in-fighter.

74
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,500
The match will probably turn
into a close proximity free-for-all.

75
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,083
The ability to focus
is the key to victory.

76
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,833
Good.

00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,333
ROOM B

78
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,833
Makunouchi, please get ready.

79
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:22,833
Right!

80
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,458
Excellent.

81
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,916
-Let's go, kid!
-Right!

82
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,625
Finally, it's Ozuma's turn.

83
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,541
You idiot! What's the point
of you getting nervous?!

84
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:48,083
I know, but his opponent, Makunouchi,
won both of his matches with KOs.

85
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,708
I'm thinking he's pretty strong.

86
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:53,708
What are you talking about?!
No rookie is stronger than Ozuma!

87
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:57,000
Next is the much
talked-of Ozuma, isn't it?

88
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,791
Yeah. I heard he incapacitated
a Nerima Boxing Group boxer

89
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,291
to the extent he can't participate
in this tournament.

90
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,833
Really?

91
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,458
Makunouchi's punches
are also quite something,

92
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,708
but it seems he had bad luck in the draw.

93
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:13,000
Hey, the guys talking in front of us
are affiliates from some boxing gym.

94
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,458
That Ozuma guy sounds really strong.

95
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,458
Heh, why don't we wait
and see how tough he really is?

TOURNAMENT RING

97
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,000
Ozuma!

98
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,250
We came to support you like we promised!

99
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,500
We're behind you all the way!
Give it your best!

100
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,458
They're here.

101
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,333
<i>It's okay. I will win.</i>

102
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,750
Is this for real?
Ippo's going to fight that guy!

103
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,833
Ippo actually came out!

104
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,875
You idiot! Of course he came out!

105
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,791
We're counting on you, Ippo!

106
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,583
Don't lose your first match!

107
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,083
Wow. He's in the fighting spirit.

108
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:20,333
In the red corner,
from the Hachinohe Boxing Group,

109
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,958
three of three with three KOs,

110
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,583
weighing at 125 and three-quarter pounds...

111
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,666
Jason Ozuma!

112
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,208
{\an8}In the blue corner,
from the Kamogawa Boxing Gym,

113
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,041
two of two with two KOs,

114
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,583
weighing in at exactly 124 pounds...

115
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:47,083
Ippo Makunouchi!

116
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,541
Go Ozuma!

117
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,708
Round one!

118
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,500
Ozuma, go for it!

119
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,333
We're here for you!

120
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,500
Go for it, Ippo!

121
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,333
Lose, and you'll pay!

122
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,833
<i>I can't let him control the pace.
The first to make a move wins.</i>

123
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,625
<i>He was thinking the same thing!</i>

124
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,083
<i>I'll keep attacking
until I create a window!</i>

125
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,166
<i>His jabs are so heavy!</i>

126
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:15,416
Right on! The kid forced it to go
at his own pace!

127
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,583
Give him a barrage of punches!
Don't give him a chance to counter!

128
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,083
<i>Damn, he got control of the pace.</i>

129
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:27,125
Ozuma, get away from Makunouchi!
Regain your balance!

130
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,875
Got him!

131
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,125
<i>It's working?!</i>

132
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,166
The idiot got hasty and took a big swing.

133
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,041
<i>Oh, no!</i>

134
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,166
Damn! It's a right hook!

135
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,416
Got him!

136
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,416
<i>He dodged!</i>

137
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,666
The intensive training
has achieved fruition!

138
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,916
Now it's my turn!

139
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,916
What the...?!

140
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,666
<i>He dodged me!</i>

141
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,125
Unbelievable!

142
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,916
Who could dodge from that position?

143
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,791
<i>What an amazing hook!</i>

144
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:12,916
<i>In terms of sharpness,</i>

145
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,166
<i>he's definitely in the same class
as Takamura-san!</i>

146
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,625
<i>That air slicing sound is not normal.</i>

147
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,791
<i>If I took an uppercut like that,
there would be hell to pay!</i>

148
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,291
<i>He dodged my left hook too!</i>

149
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,041
<i>This time, to the body!</i>

150
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,291
What an incredible sound.
That's no Japanese uppercut!

151
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,541
Yeah! And if you took a hook
like that to the body, you'd be done for!

152
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,541
Wow! This is exciting!

153
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,541
They're fighting at such close range,
but nothing connects!

154
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,750
What?

155
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,291
This is an unbelievable series
of killer blows!

156
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:10,000
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

157
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:26,916
What an incredible sound.
That's no Japanese uppercut!

158
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,166
Yeah! And if you took a hook
like that to the body, you'll be done for!

159
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,458
Wow! This is exciting!

160
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,666
They're fighting at such close range,
but nothing connects!

161
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,416
What?

162
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,958
This is an unbelievable series
of killer blows!

163
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,833
He's fast!

164
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,458
A double right hook.
That was a perfect swing.

165
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,458
<i>Another left!</i>

166
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,625
<i>He's getting faster!
I don't have a chance to hit back!</i>

167
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,083
<i>He can't dodge them continuously.</i>

168
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,041
<i>Unless he cuts his way out of there,</i>

169
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,125
<i>he has no chance of winning!</i>

170
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:12,625
<i>Speed, technique...
Ozuma is one notch above in everything.</i>

171
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,416
Another double right hook!

172
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,875
No, a triple!

173
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,833
<i>That was close!</i>

174
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,583
<i>Left?! No! I don't have time!</i>

175
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,125
<i>He's strong.</i>

176
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,250
He did it!

177
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,375
Ippo!

178
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,791
Don't be hasty, kid!

179
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,333
Rest until he counts eight!

180
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,041
<i>He's right. Calm down.</i>

181
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,375
<i>Calm down. I need to rest
as long as possible.</i>

182
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:03,500
<i>He's going to get to his feet.
He ducked slightly before contact,</i>

183
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,375
<i>lessening the damage.</i>

184
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,125
-Are you all right? Can you continue?
-Yes.

185
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,833
<i>That hit hard.</i>

186
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,875
<i>That's more than enough time.
I won't let you get away!</i>

187
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,500
Damn, that bastard is nerve-wracking!

188
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,916
But it left a lot of damage. This is bad.

189
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,416
Ozuma will probably try to finish him.

190
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,125
He's getting into position to rush.

191
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,791
<i>A four-round match
only allows two knockdowns.</i>

192
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,583
<i>I have to avoid being knocked down again
for the remaining time!</i>

193
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,125
<i>I'll finish him in one blow!</i>

194
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,750
<i>What incredible mental strength!</i>

195
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,333
<i>But my punches have to be working!</i>

196
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,583
<i>This will finish you!</i>

197
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,041
<i>Oh, no!</i>

198
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,041
<i>At any rate, I have to stop him!</i>

199
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,958
Whoa! In his desperation,
he threw a counterpunch!

200
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,166
But it was mutual.

201
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,333
No, they were both
shallow, ineffective blows.

202
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,041
<i>However, it struck a mental blow.</i>

203
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,708
<i>I know they weren't perfect...</i>

204
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,541
<i>but he still took my three best shots!</i>

205
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,666
<i>I felt that.</i>

206
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,083
<i>If he closes in now,
it'll definitely be the end of me.</i>

207
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,041
<i>He still has life in his eyes.</i>

208
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,875
<i>If I jump in without thinking,
who knows what he'll do.</i>

209
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,041
<i>Stay back!</i>

210
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,541
{\an8}REMAINING TIME - 2 SECONDS

211
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,458
He got through the first round!

212
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,541
I thought it was hopeless halfway through!

213
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,541
You've got guts, little guy!

214
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,583
That was a long first round!

215
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,916
I was having a hard time breathing
just watching that.

216
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,541
They make <i>me</i> feel tired.

217
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,333
Damn, he couldn't finish him all the way.

218
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,625
I was so sure he'd finish him too.

219
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,041
That Makunouchi guy is pretty tough!

220
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,250
I'm saved!

221
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,291
I'm sorry, sir.

222
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,875
We did all that practicing...

223
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,333
and I took a hook anyway!

224
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,958
Actually, you faced off equally.
You're doing a good job.

225
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,541
No, I'm not. I fell down too.

226
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,916
Ozuma's hook just happened
to hit you first, that's all.

227
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,583
If your uppercut had landed first,

228
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,583
the flow of the match
would have been the reverse.

229
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,083
The difference was paper-thin.

230
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,541
Go into the second round
using the same strategy.

231
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,625
Exchange blows!

232
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:36,875
But his barrage of hooks is so fast.

233
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,666
With the way I duck,
I'll be caught eventually.

234
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,333
To exchange blows,
I have to stop his barrage.

235
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:47,541
Idiot! You just did
that in the last round!

236
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,833
Oh, we hit at the same time!

237
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:56,041
Did you see how petrified Ozuma looked
when you did that?

238
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,750
That's how extraordinary your punches are.

239
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,500
Have confidence,
and challenge him fair and square!

240
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,000
If you take Ozuma's hook
when you connect with him...

241
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,208
without a doubt,
you will also be hurt severely.

242
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:17,000
But you can't be a boxer
if you're afraid of the risk.

243
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes, sir!

244
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,500
Makunouchi has a punch up his sleeve.
If you let it drag on,

245
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:26,000
you'll never know when
he'll use his lucky punch again!

246
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,583
Fortunately, he hasn't been able
to fully respond to your rapid hooks.

247
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,916
The next round is key.

248
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,500
Catch him in a barrage
and finish him fast!

249
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,666
All right.

250
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,458
Now go, Ozuma!

251
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,500
Seconds out!

252
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,208
Kid!

253
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,250
Even if you get punched,
don't let it show on your face.

254
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,500
No matter how bad it hurts, keep telling
yourself you didn't feel a thing!

255
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,208
That's the secret to survival
in a smack-up rally!

256
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,958
Yes, sir!

257
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:04,958
<i>You're finished!</i>

258
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,666
<i>The guy is trying to knock him down
from the get-go.</i>

259
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,333
Right there!

260
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,833
Argh! This is the same as before!

261
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,333
The barrage will start!

262
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,541
<i>This is it! This is the hook!</i>

263
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,125
<i>I can't dodge it!</i>

264
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,833
<i>I've got to stop it
before the barrage starts!</i>

265
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,958
All right! He stopped Ozuma!

266
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,000
My God! He stopped
the barrage with a counterpunch!

267
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,500
You idiot. That's the worst counterpunch
I've ever seen!

268
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,458
He took the full damage!

269
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,166
They hit each other again!

270
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,958
<i>I didn't feel a thing!</i>

271
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,458
His strategy was to hit simultaneously!

272
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,750
They did it again!

273
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,875
No number of bodies
is enough for that strategy!

274
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,500
Still, the same can be said for Ozuma.

275
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,291
Counting on your own guts
may be a primitive strategy,

276
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,291
but to combat Ozuma's superior
speed and technique,

277
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:42,750
this might be the best strategy
for Ippo to put his power in play.

278
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,625
<i>What a punch!</i>

279
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,041
<i>This match won't be decided by points,
no matter how it ends.</i>

280
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,125
<i>Which fighter will survive?</i>

281
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,000
<i>This is definitely worth watching!</i>

282
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:33,541
<i>Short range.</i>

283
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,583
<i>The distance in which both boxers
can reach each other.</i>

284
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,833
<i>The distance in which mutual damage
will be done if the punches hit.</i>

285
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,291
<i>That's right, the damage is mutual.</i>

286
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,291
<i>That's why I won't give up!</i>

287
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,541
<i>It didn't hurt!</i>

288
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,250
<i>I have to stop his barrage!</i>

289
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,458
<i>I have to make a stand and fight back!</i>

290
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,708
<i>This is the only place I can fight!</i>

291
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,666
<i>This is my distance!</i>

292
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,083
<i>Next time, "Test of Endurance."</i>
