ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,993
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,801
Listen to this intense cheering!

4
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,347
<i>What an amazing guy Sendo-san is!</i>

5
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,059
<i>But I won't give up first!
I must hit back for all I'm worth!</i>

6
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,395
<i>This is cool! This is so cool!</i>

7
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,566
<i>This is it! I've been wanting
to do this forever, Makunouchi!</i>

8
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:58,535
THE ROOKIE KING

9
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,081
Take this!

10
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,584
<i>It doesn't hurt!</i>

11
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,671
I'm not done yet!

12
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,798
Ippo, lash out more!

13
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,968
Yeah! Hit him, and finish him off!

14
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,263
Rocky! Hurry up and beat that guy!

15
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,598
Beat him and buy us video games!

16
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,147
Both contenders maintain
the intense fistfight with terrific force!

17
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,481
They are total equals!

18
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,400
It is impossible to predict the outcome!

19
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,903
<i>What power!</i>

20
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,908
<i>I'm not about to lose! I must strike back!</i>

21
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,913
<i>The liver blow isn't working!</i>

22
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,670
<i>It... It's no good!
I have to lash out or else!</i>

23
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,381
<i>I must hit back!</i>

24
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,925
Oh, a hit-for-hit!

25
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,182
They both stopped in their tracks!

26
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:07,228
Now, who will it be?
Who will be first to step out?

27
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,440
Ippo!

28
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,191
Kid, stand your ground!

29
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,111
Oh! Sendo takes the initiative!

30
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,488
Take that!

31
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,745
Sendo makes a bullish rush!
Makunouchi is pinned down!

32
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,789
Sendo out punches him!

33
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,792
<i>I have to lash out! I have to hit back!</i>

34
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,380
<i>I must hit back!</i>

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,510
<i>This match is mine!</i>

36
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,307
There it is! Sendo's smash!

37
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,809
It scores a direct facial hit!

38
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,810
Kid!

39
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,563
That definitely hurt!
Makunouchi is going to fall!

40
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,067
Whoa, a punch from below
lifts him up again!

41
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,527
Sendo will not permit him to fall!

42
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,198
<i>I have to lash out. I have to hit back!</i>

43
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,450
Good! Keep going and give him all you got!

44
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,202
<i>I know it already!</i>

45
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,958
Oh, no! Makunouchi lowers his guard!

46
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:10,959
Ippo!

47
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,211
Sendo poises to smash!

48
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,170
Ippo-kun!

49
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,715
<i>I have to lash out...</i>

50
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,675
Kid!

51
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,469
Yes!

52
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,972
<i>Now you're through!</i>

53
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,392
<i>What?!</i>

54
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:31,145
Oh, dear! Makunouchi crumples over,
to his great fortune!

55
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,648
He misses the smash by a hair!

56
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,859
<i>I must... lash... out!</i>

57
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,539
Ah! Makunouchi scores a right!

58
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,166
It scores a direct hit on
Sendo's unprotected temple!

59
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,919
<i>How about that?</i>

60
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,673
<i>How about that?!</i>

61
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,930
Oh, my! Sendo doesn't flinch
and he proceeds to strike back!

62
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,891
Ooh! All right, that's the way, Sendo!

63
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,729
<i>But that's impossible.
I felt a solid impact!</i>

64
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,442
Sendo goes wild! He makes a bullish rush!

65
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,444
Rocky!

66
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,654
Thirty seconds remain in round three!

67
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,198
Will the match be settled
in the time remaining?!

68
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,909
Sendo connects left!

69
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,704
Then right!

70
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,707
Sendo attacks, buoyed by the calls
for Rocky!

71
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,210
But can he even hear our voices
from the spectator stands?!

72
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,963
The cheers are simply deafening!

73
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,215
An upper connects!

74
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,967
A right!

75
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,927
Punches shower on Makunouchi!

76
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,305
Can he endure for
the seven seconds remaining?!

77
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,182
Hang in there, kid!

78
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,184
Can Sendo bring him down?!

79
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,688
Oops! Will Makunouchi fall?!

80
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,193
The bell rings! Makunouchi is saved
by the bell in the nick of time.

81
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,696
What?! Sendo's fists stay in motion!

82
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,241
He can't hear the bell for the cheering!
Neither can the referee!

83
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,785
Makunouchi is being pummeled.

84
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,828
This is dangerous!

85
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,251
Hey, something weird is going on!
Didn't the bell ring?!

86
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,712
The three minutes are up! Stop them!

87
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,216
Referee, the bell!
The bell has rung, referee!

88
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,513
Stop, Sendo!

89
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,556
Sendo!

90
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,061
Sendo, the bell rang!
Return to your corner, Sendo!

91
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,992
Approximately ten seconds
into the ending bell for round three,

92
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,079
Makunouchi takes a merciless beating!

93
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,665
The follow-up attack
after the bell is a foul.

94
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,751
However, the referee has full authority
of what goes on inside the ring!

95
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,586
Since the referee did not notice it

96
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,548
Sendo's actions have
been deemed unavoidable!

97
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,841
But technicalities aside,

98
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,592
my concern is for Makunouchi's health

99
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,304
after taking such dangerous blows
in a virtually defenseless state!

100
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,517
He's strong.

101
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,728
Sendo-san is really strong.

102
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,482
I know, so stop talking.
Now sit down and get some rest.

103
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,526
I... I can't.

104
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,613
If I sit down...
I won't be able to get up again.

105
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,659
I... I have to get up.

106
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,578
Just sit there!

107
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,624
Damn! But how is it possible?

108
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,379
When I hit him in the temple,
I felt the impact in my right fist.

109
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,633
So how is he still standing?!

110
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,969
Sendo feels the same.

111
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,388
You took far more hits than he did.

112
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,515
However, you're still standing.

113
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,517
I'm sure that sucks for him too.

114
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,603
Are you all right, Makunouchi?

115
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,771
How should we handle the next round?

116
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,525
I can do it! I'm still okay.

117
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,027
But still...

118
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,281
I... I'm all right.

119
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:14,619
Like the Chief said...
I took the greater number of punches,

120
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,287
but I'm still standing.

121
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,164
That's why I'm okay!

122
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,629
I haven't lost just yet!

123
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,673
I understand.

124
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,468
Since the man himself is saying so...

125
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,553
All right.

126
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,140
Kid! All you need is one more effort!

127
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,393
Right. I'll do my best.

128
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,812
<i>Any more will be life-threatening.</i>

129
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,691
<i>If you wobble even slightly
in the next round, I will not hesitate.</i>

130
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,194
<i>Don't hate me for it.</i>

131
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,990
We know who's going to win.

132
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,367
In his current state,

133
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,744
Makunouchi will fall over
with one little push.

134
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,747
Ro-o-cky!

135
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,999
That's all you have to do now.

136
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,876
They're waiting for you to finish it.

137
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,004
Listen to them.
Everyone's calling for you.

138
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,677
Go Rocky!

139
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,976
Game systems!

140
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,353
You'll buy them for us when
you win, right?!

141
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,981
You wouldn't lie to us, Rocky, would you?!

142
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,484
Get real! If I bought one for
each of you, that'd be 200,000 yen!

143
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,445
The fight money won't cover that!

144
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,782
Uh, how much would
I have to add to the All-Japan purse?

145
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,660
You promised, so you got
to buy them for us!

146
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,206
<i>I know.</i>

147
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,709
<i>Just wait.</i>

148
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,211
<i>It'll only take a little longer.</i>

149
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,756
<i>Just wait.</i>

150
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,634
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

151
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,346
Seconds out!

152
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,684
Okay! Go, Sendo! Finish him off!

153
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,519
Go give the audience what they want!

154
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,564
Sendo...

155
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,025
Seconds out!

156
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,027
Now, round four is about to begin!

157
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,528
Will Sendo take the win by storm?

158
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,071
Or will Makunouchi hold on?!

159
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,119
Damn, that's dangerous.

160
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,704
He looks like he'll fall over.

161
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,332
Go finish him, Rocky!

162
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,000
He's exhausted!

163
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,376
Put him out of his misery!

164
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,086
KO him, Rocky!

165
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,963
Flatten the guy!

166
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:31,964
Seconds out!

167
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,551
The seconds in the blue corner
still won't leave the ring.

168
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,928
Are they being cautious
of this opportunity?

169
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,973
Rocky! Don't tease the poor slob too much!

170
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,933
Seconds out!

171
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,436
What's wrong? Get him ready.

172
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,937
Seconds out!

173
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,482
Sendo!

174
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,242
Huh?

175
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:09,502
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

176
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,588
Sendo!

177
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,680
Huh?

178
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,893
What on earth has happened?

179
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,438
The referee suddenly signaled
that the match is over!

180
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,487
<i>How long?</i>

181
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,449
<i>How long have you been unconscious?</i>

182
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,451
<i>Since that single hit to the temple?</i>

183
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,291
<i>You sure gave the audience
what they wanted.</i>

184
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,463
<i>You still respond to your fans
even when you're out like a light.</i>

185
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:59,718
<i>You were charged by their cheers,
though you were dead on your feet.</i>

186
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:04,223
<i>You wanted to fight for them</i>...
<i>didn't you, Sendo?</i>

187
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,520
The match is over!

188
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,731
Sendo is not responding to
the fourth round opening bell!

189
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,775
He loses by default!

190
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,279
The entire stadium is silent.

191
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,531
People still do not
comprehend the situation!

192
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:24,410
And the one who comprehends
it least is Makunouchi!

193
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,997
He stands dumbfounded,
still staring at the blue corner!

194
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,543
Apparently, Sendo is unconscious!

195
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,258
The cause is probably the single hit
to the temple from Makunouchi.

196
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,260
Yet Sendo still fought on!

197
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,597
The element that kept him
in motion was, without a doubt,

198
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,268
the spectators filling
this stadium to capacity today!

199
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,440
At this moment,
Makunouchi's hand is raised!

200
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,693
Makunouchi claims the Featherweight
Class All-Japan Rookie title!

201
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,321
In the meantime,
Sendo is taken away on a stretcher.

202
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,198
He has still not regained consciousness.

203
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,702
The unrecognizable face of the victor
and the sorry state of the defeated

204
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,079
speak volumes of the scars of battle!

205
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,707
Takeshi Sendo vs. Ippo Makunouchi!

206
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,002
Without a doubt, this will be
a fight to go down in the history

207
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,713
of the All-Japan Rookie
Championship Tournament!

208
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,218
He's not moving. Is he really unconscious?

209
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,679
Did he fight while he was unconscious?

210
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,725
He lived up to our cheers to the very end.

211
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,228
Sendo! You're the best!

212
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,815
You were our Rocky to the bitter end!

213
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:42,780
Rocky!

214
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,075
Kid!

215
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,326
Ippo-kun!

216
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,913
-Chief...
-What is it?

217
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,500
Did I really...

218
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,669
Did I really win the fight?

219
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,672
That's right. You're the winner!

220
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,259
It doesn't feel real whatsoever...

221
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,930
that I could beat the amazing Sendo-san.

222
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,184
I left the corner sure
I was going to lose.

223
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,187
It's like a dream.

224
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,356
Kid?

225
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,527
You really hung in there.

226
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,784
Now, let's go.

227
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,369
Come on, Ippo-kun. Grab on.

228
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,162
Thanks.

229
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,461
<i>I still can't believe the match is over.</i>

230
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,387
<i>I know he isn't there...</i>

231
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:57,730
<i>but it feels like Sendo-san
is still there looking straight at me.</i>

232
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,611
<i>It feels like Sendo-san
is still sitting there,</i>

233
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,281
<i>getting ready to fight.</i>

234
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,176
Sendo! Sendo, can you hear me?

235
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,764
You're awake, Sendo.

236
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,351
What is it?

237
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,020
I can't remember.

238
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,940
What can't you remember?
Who won the match?

239
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:44,193
<i>That</i> I can tell... I lost.

240
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,486
I lost, but...

241
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,780
You lost, but what? You can tell me.

242
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:52,117
How exactly did I lose?

243
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,119
What happened to me?

244
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,289
I can't remember
that part of the match whatsoever.

245
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,293
Don't dwell on today's match.
It was a great fight.

246
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,088
A great fight?

247
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,298
What do you mean, a great fight?

248
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,842
I want you to tell me
how I lost the match!

249
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,260
Sendo!

250
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,860
This is all I have on me.

251
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,321
I know it's only enough for one system,
but take it.

252
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,116
We'll take it for now.

253
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,119
However, you promised us five!

254
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,830
When are you going to buy them for us?!

255
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,043
If you become champion...

256
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,629
you can do it, right?

257
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,843
I can wait. We'll postpone
your promise to us.

258
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,847
We'll wait until you become champion.

259
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,017
Next time...

260
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,853
Next time, swear you'll buy them
for sure, Rocky!

261
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,780
Rocky? Are you guys still willing
to call me that name?

262
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,867
That's what the entire audience
called you.

263
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,369
That's the kind of fight you had!

264
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,557
Makunouchi, how does it feel to
be the All-Japan Rookie of the Year?

265
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,642
What was it like fighting Sendo?

266
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,395
Now that you're a ranked fighter,
what's your next goal?

267
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,024
Uh, well... I can't respond
to all that at once. I, uh...

268
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,526
Hey, the guy's hurt!

269
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,071
He hasn't been fully treated for
his injuries yet. That's all for today!

270
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,655
-No fair!
-Hold on a second!

271
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,032
Wait...

272
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,533
How is he?

273
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,286
Oh, he regained consciousness
a little while ago.

274
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:03,165
He gave us the one comment,
"Today, I lost."

275
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,793
I... I see.

276
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,045
-Now go!
-Chief?!

277
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,298
<i>Thank goodness he's awake.</i>

278
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,509
Humph. "Today," is it?

279
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,970
That headstrong comment is Sendo all over.

280
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,098
What is it?

281
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,351
It's like after hearing his comment,

282
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,978
it all suddenly feels real.

283
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,567
I finally feel that I won
against Sendo-san today.

284
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,494
<i>I did it!</i>

285
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,455
KO TIME: ENDED AT ROUND THREE
IPPO MAKUNOUCHI

286
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:48,585
{\an8}ALL-JAPAN ROOKIE OF THE YEAR WINNER
AWARDED THE MVP AWARD!

287
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,503
PLUM VILLAGE

288
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,380
In celebration of Ippo Makunouchi-kun

289
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,092
taking the All-Japan Rookie
of the Year title, cheers!

290
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,677
Cheers!

291
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,594
Wow!

292
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,098
Thank you. Thank you so much!

293
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,976
Now, now, Ippo-kun.
Don't be so stiff and formal.

294
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,354
Yeah, everybody's family
at the celebration table!

295
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:11,358
<i>It was nerve-wracking,
but Ippo won right on schedule.</i>

296
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,986
<i>I'll use this victory in order to...</i>

297
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,283
<i>Or at least, that was the plan,</i>

298
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,785
<i>but just look at him.</i>

299
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,873
<i>Even I know better than to
drag a wounded boxer around town</i>

300
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,292
<i>on the night after the fact.</i>

301
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,169
What is it, Takamura?

302
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,921
Don't tell me you're plotting
some insolence again.

303
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,007
I won't let it happen.

304
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,177
Give me a break.
I just gave up on it, didn't I?

305
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,804
<i>Jeez! What the hell did
I come all the way to Osaka for?!</i>

306
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,433
Oh, your beer glass is empty, Chief.

307
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,643
Oh, thank you kindly.

308
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,108
Wow, amazing! Please, have another glass.

309
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,194
Oh, no, no. I've had enough, thank you.

310
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,778
Don't be like that...

311
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,782
No, really, I'm fine.
Let me fill up your glass instead.

312
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,286
What are you doing all of a sudden, you?!

313
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,163
That's what I'd like to ask!

314
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,040
What a place to leave wide open!

315
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,542
Oh, no! Chief...

316
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,337
So, you want to make an impression,
you old sex fiend!

317
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,047
Think of your age!

318
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,465
And what about you then?!

319
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,050
Your punch is peeking out below!

320
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,054
Shut up! I have an excuse
because I'm young!

321
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,305
BS-ing young fool!

322
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,225
A counterpunch!

323
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,560
Can someone over 70 normally
do a move like that?!

324
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,812
You freaky geezer zombie!

325
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,274
Oh, shit! Stop him!
Ippo, we need some help!

326
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,319
Huh? Ippo?

327
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,033
Yeah. It's true, Mom. I really won!

328
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,578
<i>I'm not interested in who won.
I'm more worried about your health.</i>

329
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,372
You always worry like that.

330
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,582
I'm the All-Japan Rookie of the Year.

331
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:55,462
And I also got the highest prize,
and I really won!

332
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:02,052
I'm okay. I got beat up a little,
but my health is fine.

333
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,637
<i>I see.</i>

334
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,307
I'm coming home tomorrow,
so I'll bring souvenirs. See you.

335
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,600
<i>Ippo?</i>

336
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,020
<i>Congratulations.</i>

337
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,108
Thanks, Mom.

338
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,780
Congratulations, huh?

339
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,366
I can't believe I came this far.

340
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,620
<i>I don't know how much further I can go,</i>

341
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,125
<i>but I want to go as far as I can!</i>

342
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,506
What's going on?!

343
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,300
Is the party over already?!

344
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,843
-It's bad.
-What?!

345
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,387
Takamura-san KO-ed the Chief!

346
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,388
<i>What?!</i>

347
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,015
I couldn't help it!

348
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,892
After he threw that great punch at me,
I did it by accident!

349
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,269
An accident?!

350
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,021
You're the Middleweight Champion!

351
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,106
Shut up! At any rate, run!

352
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,109
Since we're already running,
let's get our fill of Osaka women!

353
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,193
I'm up for that action!

354
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,695
-Me, too!
-Our fill?

355
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,780
Prepare to enter the adult world!

356
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,657
What?! This is a bad idea!

357
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,328
I'm still a minor, and I don't want to!

358
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,376
{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

359
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,571
<i>Roadwork. Training that
takes place outside the gym,</i>

360
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,324
<i>primarily on the dart-and-dash.</i>

361
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:34,121
<i>It fosters basic endurance for boxing,
important for maintaining stamina,</i>

362
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,374
<i>which is where daily results
will generally appear.</i>

363
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,001
<i>I also found it hard in the beginning.</i>

364
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,254
<i>But now I'm totally used to it.</i>

365
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,589
<i>And that is the one most certain bit</i>

366
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,926
<i>of proof of my two years of effort!</i>

367
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,470
<i>Next time, "The Continuing Journey."</i>
