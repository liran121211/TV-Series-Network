ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,958
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,625
Yikes! Makunouchi can't stand up!
The blow was that powerful!

4
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,541
Will this decide the match?!

5
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:32,708
<i>This guy is too much for me!</i>

6
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,541
<i>No, it isn't me!</i>

7
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,333
<i>It's having an effect!</i>

8
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:49,125
<i>His last attack used up
his final shred of strength!</i>

9
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,541
<i>But he still managed to
squeeze out that much power.</i>

10
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,875
<i>Yeah!</i>

11
00:01:56,958 --> 00:02:00,041
<i>Even Miyata-kun fought way past his limit!</i>

12
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:05,250
<i>I can't cop out
just because my right fist hurts!</i>

13
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:10,041
<i>How can I expect to defeat this guy
if I'm that weak?!</i>

14
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,875
<i>I have to do better!</i>

15
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:17,916
Kid!

16
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:23,375
<i>I can't possibly beat this guy
if I'm that weak!</i>

17
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:29,916
He's up! Makunouchi has risen to his feet!

18
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:35,875
VICTORY OR DEFEAT

19
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:39,916
<i>You bastard! You should've stayed down.</i>

20
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,708
<i>I was naïve to believe
I could fight fully without my right fist!</i>

21
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,833
<i>There's no way
I could defeat him like that!</i>

22
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,958
<i>I cannot afford to lose.</i>

23
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,833
<i>I will win! I'll beat you down
as many times as it takes!</i>

24
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:58,041
<i>I don't care if it costs me my right fist!</i>

25
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:02,041
<i>I'm fighting against an incredible boxer!</i>

26
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,416
<i>I'm going to fight until I'm satisfied!</i>

27
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,208
Now, the match is about to resume.

28
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,208
Mashiba slowly walks
in front of Makunouchi.

29
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,708
Now they face off!

30
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,541
I'll finish you!

31
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,791
Kid!

32
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,500
<i>It's not enough!</i>

33
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,791
<i>It'd take more than this
to make Mashiba-san fall!</i>

34
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,791
Two reps from the right! That stupid kid...

35
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,833
He's placed the last glimmer of hope
on his right fist!

36
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,125
<i>It's still not enough!</i>

37
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,250
He keels over!

38
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,208
Makunouchi's three great consecutive hits

39
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,458
makes Mashiba's tall frame capsize!

40
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,333
Mashiba's legs are buckling!

41
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,708
His knees could touch canvas
at any moment!

42
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,583
Will he fall?!

43
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,958
<i>It... It'll take more
than that to knock me down!</i>

44
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,916
<i>I'm starting to lose feeling
in my right fist.</i>

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,708
<i>I must go now while he's still reeling
from the earlier damage!</i>

46
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,916
No! If he takes
a punch in the face right now,

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,208
there's no way he'll withstand it!

48
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,375
I can't lose.

49
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,791
I can't afford to lose!

50
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,000
Good! Anyway, stay in there!

51
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,291
<i>I can't afford to... I can't afford to lose!</i>

52
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,708
Break it up! Step back!

53
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,375
Mashiba! Let go of him!

54
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,500
<i>This guy has no intention of letting go!</i>

55
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,166
<i>Then I can also play dirty!</i>

56
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,125
<i>I'm not about to lose!</i>

57
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,583
<i>Why, you...</i>

58
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,500
Neither is compromising!

59
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,458
Both boxers display great tenacity!

60
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,458
Who will fall first?!

61
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,416
Ippo! Keep punching!

62
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,458
You're getting to him!

63
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,000
Stick to it, Mashiba!

64
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,958
Boxing isn't all fists!

65
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,458
Shake him off, Makunouchi!

66
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,958
<i>I can't... afford to...</i>

67
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,416
Oh, my! Is Mashiba losing his grip?!

68
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,250
<i>Just a little more!</i>

69
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,875
It's coming undone!

70
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,750
Mashiba's clinch is
gradually coming undone!

71
00:05:58,833 --> 00:05:59,916
Get...

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,250
off...

73
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,583
of...

74
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,208
me!

75
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,041
He's off!

76
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,791
Mashiba has released his grip!

77
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,291
Go, kid! It's your chance!

78
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,333
Pour your heart
and soul into your punches!

79
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,333
Watch out, Mashiba! Look down!

80
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,333
Dammit!

81
00:06:58,958 --> 00:06:59,916
Ryo!

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,250
He's down!

83
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,083
Mashiba falls!

84
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,583
He did it!

85
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,166
Mashiba truly persevered,
but he finally falls for the first time!

86
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,833
And in all likelihood,
this will be a reversal KO!

87
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,500
Don't bother counting.
There's no way he'll get up!

88
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,208
<i>Don't stand up.</i>

89
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,041
<i>My right fist has gone dead.</i>

90
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,000
<i>I can't punch anymore!</i>

91
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,750
<i>My strength is gone.</i>

92
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:33,333
<i>So, don't get up! Please don't get up!</i>

93
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,208
<i>Hurry!</i>

94
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,708
<i>Hurry up and count!</i>

95
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,458
<i>Stay back!</i>

96
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,833
I don't want to... lose!

97
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,833
Mashiba exhausted his strength!

98
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,458
He literally sank into the canvas!

99
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,833
I did it.

100
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,541
I won!

101
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,041
I did it!

102
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,833
The match is over!

103
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,708
And at this very moment,
the featherweight class Rookie King

104
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,541
of the Eastern Japan Rookie Tournament
has been determined!

105
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,041
-His name is Ippo Makunouchi!
-Yagi-san, you're crushing me!

106
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,500
I can't believe he took Eastern Japan!

107
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,333
He did great!

108
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,833
<i>That took a lot of guts.</i>

109
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,375
Reckless idiot.

110
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,500
Who knows what damage
you did to your right fist?

111
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,000
Right now, it's in one ear
and out the other.

112
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,541
Anyway, you've done a good job so far.

113
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,333
Mashiba!

114
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,333
No! It's not over yet!

115
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,333
Come on, you bastard!

116
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,541
Stop it, Mashiba! It's over!

117
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,125
-Shut up!
-Come on...

118
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,125
It's not over yet!

119
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:40,083
There's no way I'd lose
to someone like him!

120
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,208
Uh, excuse me...

121
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,208
How should I say it?

122
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,458
Thank you for the fight.

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,416
Let's go, Mashiba.

124
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,166
Damn it!

125
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,208
Mashiba! You did great!

126
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,208
Yeah, you've got guts!

127
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,958
Next time, win by KO!

128
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,208
Come back to Korakuen Hall someday!

129
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,708
<i>Shut up!</i>

130
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,750
He certainly was a fearsome opponent.

131
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,750
Yes.

132
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,625
When I knocked him down at the end,

133
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,291
I was convinced
he would get to his feet again.

134
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:40,125
So I started chanting, "Don't get up!"

135
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,208
The count felt like it took forever.

136
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,000
I was the one standing over him,

137
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,708
but I was scared to death.

138
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:56,583
But in the meantime,
you beat the guy you were so afraid of.

139
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:00,000
For you're the Rookie King
of Eastern Japan!

140
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,250
Chief...

141
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,916
Now, go on and salute them.

142
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,958
Right!

143
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,583
Makunouchi! Nice fight!

144
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,333
You always reverse the match!

145
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,708
That's what's great about you!

146
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,208
Don't make us so nervous!

147
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:31,625
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

148
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,375
The Eastern Japan
Rookie Championship Tournament

149
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,875
was fought in a total of 11 classes.

150
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,541
The rookie champions
from all classes are here tonight!

151
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,375
The fight for each class

152
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,791
was full of invigorating
matches worthy of fresh fighters.

153
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,166
And now, the awards ceremony!

154
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,541
<i>This is nerve-wracking.</i>

155
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:56,291
<i>I had no idea there was
a ceremony following the final match.</i>

156
00:11:56,375 --> 00:12:00,708
And next, the award given to the most
impressive boxer of the tournament,

157
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,291
the MVP Rookie Award goes to...

158
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,083
Makunouchi in the featherweight class!

159
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,708
Huh? What?

160
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,208
You mean...

161
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,791
I'm the MVP Rookie of the Year?

162
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,791
Uh... Thanks.

163
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,416
MEDICAL ROOM ENTRANCE

164
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,041
4TH FLOOR EMERGENCY EXIT

165
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,416
KEEP DOOR SHUT AT ALL TIMES

166
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,166
<i>Ryo</i>...

167
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,583
<i>Look what you did to yourself for me.</i>

168
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,875
<i>It must have hurt all this time.</i>

169
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:48,083
<i>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!</i>

170
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,750
That last punch...

171
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:57,000
That last punch... really hurt.

172
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:03,291
The guy definitely had a crushed fist,

173
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,750
but he still delivered
a horrific punch with it.

174
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,041
I was so sure this was my chance
to climb up to the top,

175
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,000
but it's all over now.

176
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,375
Ryo...

177
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,500
Ryo? Maybe boxing isn't...

178
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,750
Maybe you should...

179
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,000
I have to start over.

180
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,500
After all, the best thing
about boxing is that it's all fair.

181
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,333
This world is pretty comfortable.

182
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,000
It's too good to quit.

183
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,583
That's true.

184
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,833
When you get better,

185
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,250
you can try for it again.

186
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,500
I never expected Ippo to make MVP!

187
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,708
I can't believe it!

188
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:13,291
Really. We didn't predict that at all.

189
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,083
What's your damage, loudmouth?

190
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,750
My dark horse came in first!

191
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,750
Remember?! We bet on it before!

192
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,791
We bet on who would win, Ippo or Mashiba!

193
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,333
I was the only one who bet on Ippo, so...

194
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,333
Right, Takamura-san?
You took notes, right?!

195
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,583
Hey, isn't that a little much?!

196
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,375
That should shake him out
of his alcohol stupor!

197
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,500
Alcohol?

198
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,958
<i>What are those guys doing?</i>

199
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:51,958
<i>Ozuma-san...</i>

200
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,458
<i>Kobashi-san...</i>

201
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,875
<i>Hayami-san...</i>

202
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,458
<i>Mashiba-san...</i>

203
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,583
<i>They all did themselves proud.</i>

204
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,250
<i>Miyata-kun...</i>

205
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,958
<i>In the end, I didn't get to fight you.</i>

206
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:18,875
<i>But I'm sure the way
I fought today would make you proud.</i>

207
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,958
<i>So I'm the Rookie of
the Year for Eastern Japan.</i>

Ooh, he's in here!
He's in here! Let's see...

219
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:35,541
He conquered featherweight
with his dynamite punches!

220
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,958
The other time he was in here,
it was a tiny write-up.

221
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,375
But now that he's rookie champ,
he gets the star treatment!

222
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,541
Oh! Hey, Ippo!

223
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,750
Oh, Umezawa-kun!

224
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,416
I haven't seen you
since the end of last semester.

225
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,041
Yeah. Anyway, congratulations...

226
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,875
Rookie Champion of Eastern Japan.
I was moved!

227
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,083
What? You came to watch?!

228
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,541
Of course! I've been there
for all your matches.

229
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,375
-Yeah!
-Thank you!

230
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,041
I'm totally looking forward
to the All-Japan Tournament.

231
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,041
We'll definitely be there to root for you!

232
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,791
I hate to say this when
you have such high hopes for me,

233
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,125
but it looks like I'll have to withdraw
from the All-Japan.

234
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,541
Withdraw?! How come?

235
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,416
I fractured my right fist.

236
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,291
It'll take two months to heal.

237
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,125
The All-Japan is in February.

238
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,333
My fist will just be healing up
by then, so...

239
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,291
I see.

240
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,750
Besides, it'll take a while to recover
from that last match.

241
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,333
Chief said I should focus on
running for the time being.

242
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:42,333
Which means, for the time being,
we won't get to see you fight.

243
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,583
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, don't sweat it!

244
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,833
Tell us when you get your next match.

245
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:52,333
We may be working full-time by then,
but we'll be there to cheer you on.

246
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,333
Sure!

247
00:17:56,416 --> 00:18:02,041
For you, this is the last semester
of your high school career.

248
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,416
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

249
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,333
<i>My high school days are almost over.</i>

250
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,333
<i>Umezawa-kun and the others
will go find work,</i>

251
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,333
<i>and I'm sure everyone else
has decided what they want to be.</i>

252
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:16,333
<i>I told my teacher I was going to
keep boxing, but I wonder.</i>

253
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,875
That's why, whether you are

254
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,416
going to seek employment
or go on to college,

255
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,916
I would like you to fight hard
for your goal.

256
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,833
That is all.

257
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,625
My goal?

258
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,083
<i>The Eastern Japan was my goal.</i>

259
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:42,083
<i>I don't know when my next match will be.</i>

260
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,875
<i>I need to find a new goal.</i>

261
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,666
<i>I wonder how
Mashiba's little sister is doing?</i>

262
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,916
Please stop badmouthing my brother.

263
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,375
<i>I haven't been to that bakery since.</i>

264
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:14,083
<i>I couldn't bring myself to tell her
that I was his opponent.</i>

265
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,833
<i>She probably came to the match,
so she must have been surprised.</i>

266
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,291
<i>There's no way
she feels positive towards me.</i>

267
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,916
<i>I have to give her an apology!</i>

268
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,875
<i>All right, here goes!</i>

269
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:36,458
<i>But how do I apologize without sounding
like I'm making excuses?</i>

270
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,250
<i>What should I do? I can't turn back now.</i>

271
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,875
<i>At any rate, I have to go!</i>

272
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,375
Well, take care.

273
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,333
I will.

274
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,625
Welcome...

275
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,958
Um, hello.

276
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,750
<i>Huh?</i>

277
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,000
Please, come in.

278
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,250
Uh, sure!

279
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,250
I mean, uh...

280
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,250
We have some freshly baked pastries.

281
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,541
What? Uh, no... That girl!

282
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,791
I mean, I would like some yakisoba buns.

283
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:16,750
Pardon?

285
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,416
Thank you, come again.

286
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,250
Do you need anything else?

287
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,375
Um, about that girl who was just here...

288
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,250
When will she be working next?

289
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,250
What? Oh, do you mean Kumi-chan?

290
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:45,208
Actually... today was
Kumi-chan's last day here.

291
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,291
What? Her last day?

292
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,250
She's going to be a secretary
at her brother's place of work.

293
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,791
She was a good girl
and the customers really liked her,

294
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,250
so I'm sorry to see her go.

295
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,250
That can't be.

296
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,958
<i>For some reason, it doesn't taste as good,</i>

297
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,500
<i>even though it's
the same old yakisoba bun.</i>

298
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,750
<i>I guess I'll never get to see her again.</i>

299
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,583
<i>Although she didn't do it directly,
she completely broke my heart.</i>

300
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,625
<i>So, that was the last "welcome."</i>

<i>The smash. A punch thrown
in an upward slant</i>

313
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,750
<i>that uses a well-trained body
like a giant spring.</i>

314

<i>It is powerful enough to knock down

315
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:36,666
<i>It is a weapon
that was prepared by someone</i>

<i>who's been looking forward
to fighting with me.</i>

317

<i>I'd love to fight him
