ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,958
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,833
<i>Next is double punches from the left!</i>

4
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,416
<i>I'll get him this time!</i>

5
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,541
<i>Right?!</i>

6
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,083
Hey...

7
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,750
‪Ow.

8
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,375
Hasn't his fist...

9
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,750
...healed yet?

10
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,541
It's healed. But he can't punch with it.

11
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,375
<i>Why?</i>

12
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,333
The match is coming up soon,

13
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,458
and since you're not
in the greatest condition,

14
00:01:58,541 --> 00:01:59,666
let's call it a day.

15
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,083
Okay?

16
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,083
<i>Yeah, his step-in and left punch
are really good,</i>

17
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:11,416
<i>but is he really going
to take on Sendo like that?</i>

18
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,958
He's probably trying to punch,

19
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,166
but something psychologically
is preventing him.

20
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,625
He's afraid of being hurt again.

21
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,500
The match is in two days, you know.

22
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,291
Chief, what are we going to do?

23
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,791
<i>Kid.</i>

24
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:39,291
THROW YOUR RIGHT!

25
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,583
<i>It won't be long now.</i>

26
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:56,083
<i>Very soon now, I'll be able to box
to my heart's content!</i>

27
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,000
Enough.

28
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,458
We're going nowhere
if your rhythm is shot to hell.

29
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,583
But maybe if I do some more...

30
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,208
It won't change anything.

31
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,375
But, sir...

32
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,166
Even his mitt-punching rhythm is off.

33
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,625
So, he got even more self-conscious
after finding out his right is no good.

34
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,750
-Pack up our stuff, Yagi-chan.
-What?

35
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,625
Wait a minute, please!

36
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,583
I said I'd decide to withdraw or proceed

37
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:40,416
based on how well your fist
had healed by the day of the fight.

38
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,916
And we have the result right before us.

39
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,083
We are withdrawing from the match.

40
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,541
We're getting out of here.

41
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,041
Please wait, Chief!

42
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,583
If I wait, will you be able
to use your right fist?

43
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:54,125
No, I can't say that for sure,

44
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,000
but when I'm actually at the match...

45
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,125
Chief.

46
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,500
-That's not like you, old man.
-What?!

47
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,875
I said that's not like you.

48
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,125
You never throw in the towel
before even trying.

49
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,125
What did you say?

50
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:14,166
You know, Takamura-kun,
even the Chief wants to let him fight.

51
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,000
But as Ippo's supervisor...

52
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:19,291
Takamura, do you have some kind of plan?

53
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,500
Rather than a plan, I'd call it advice.

54
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,000
Advice?

55
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,500
It was the fourth match after my debut,

56
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,000
five days before the match.

57
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,458
I was just hitting the sandbag

58
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,458
when a horrific pain shot up my right arm!

59
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,750
Turns out, I had mashed up my wrist

60
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,625
with my own super dynamite punch.

61
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,666
Yeah, but your fourth match
was your fastest ever,

62
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,625
which you won by KO in 15 seconds
in the first round, wasn't it?

63
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,125
You defeated your opponent
that fast with one left punch?

64
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,125
No, I used my right.
I beat him with my right!

65
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,541
But what about the pain?

66
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,750
My opponent was a tough boxer,
and it would've been

67
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,416
hard to beat him with one left punch.

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
However, if I was
at my normal awesome strength,

69
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,625
I could never lose.
But, boy, my right hand hurt.

70
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,125
What should I do?!

71
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,416
What did you do?

72
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,916
I worried!

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,625
Y... Yeah!

74
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,500
That's it!

75
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,125
One shot! I'd knock him down
before I could feel any pain!

76
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,125
What?

77
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,583
I'd charge my opponent
the moment the bell rang

78
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,125
and let him have it
from my right while he was still gawking!

79
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,666
It was to make the opponent take a nap

80
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,125
before I could feel any pain.

81
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,750
If done right,
I could win in three seconds!

82
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,333
That's ridiculous!

83
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,833
One shot... huh?

84
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,166
Hey, don't take him seriously.

85
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,333
That's more like a specialized attack!

86
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:45,125
Well, yes, I know I can't defeat
Sendo-san with one punch, but...

87
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,333
What if...?

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,083
Takamura resigned himself
for that match in his own fashion.

89
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,375
He would either nail it in one shot,
or give it up in one shot.

90
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,083
It was a gamble of sorts.

91
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:02,708
If there's a possibility that I can
truly fight with him even for a moment...

92
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,208
Ippo...

93
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,583
Ippo-kun...

94
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,583
So, what's it going to be?

95
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,583
Put your fist on ice.

96
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,583
That mitt-punching probably made it
start hurting again.

97
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,625
If there's any pain, you won't be able to
throw a good first punch

98
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,291
in tomorrow's match.

99
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,791
However, if you realize
that you cannot use your right,

100
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,791
we will withdraw on the spot.

101
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:29,750
Understood?

102
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,041
Thank you, sir!

103
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,958
<i>If only... If only the pain would go away.</i>

104
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,750
Sendo-san will win, of course.

105
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:54,958
I can't wait!

106
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,625
Hey, it's Rocky. Rocky's here!

107
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,250
Hey, it's our hero! It's Sendo!

108
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,625
Our hopes are riding on you!

109
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,250
Pulverize that Makunouchi guy!

110
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,541
The red trunks of the Eastern team!

111
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,083
Seeing those finally makes
All-Japan a reality.

112
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,125
Although we never got to wear them.

113
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:24,541
What's this? You guys
have never worn those trunks?!

114
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:28,375
That is <i>such</i> a shame.

115
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,291
Shut up.

116
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,666
<i>The pain stayed with me.</i>

117
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,958
<i>I won't be able to punch
at full power like this.</i>

118
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,291
<i>But I have no choice!</i>

119
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,583
Who's there?!

120
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,791
Yoo-hoo!

121
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,291
Dr. Yamaguchi! What are you doing here?!

122
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,583
Oh, please.

123
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,625
I'm your supervising physician, remember?

124
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,791
Isn't that right, Chief?

125
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,083
Did you ask her to come here
on my behalf, sir?

126
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,041
Is that Ippo's chiropractor?!

127
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,750
See? She's just like I said, right?!

128
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,458
This is amazing.

129
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,083
Hey, have you normalized?

130
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,500
No, but those knockers help!

131
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,916
I can believe that.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,291
{\an8}EASTERN TEAM

133
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,875
{\an8}Clench your fist.

134
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,291
{\an8}Harder.

135
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,791
The swelling has gone down,
but there's a lot of pain left.

136
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,291
Is there about 30 minutes until the match?

137
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,208
I didn't really want to do this, but...

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,125
We're going to have to anesthetize it.

139
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,791
I was informed of it from
the very beginning, so I'm ready.

140
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:37,666
Still, just to make sure you know,
anesthetics aren't perfect.

141
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,833
If you break a bone in
the same place during the match,

142
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,416
it will not handle that pain as well.

143
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Right.

144
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,458
Also, when it wears off,

145
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,416
all of the pain it subdued
during that time will assault you.

146
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,916
Yes, I know. Please proceed!

147
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,416
Very well.

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,250
Yikes, I'm no good at stuff like that.

149
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,416
Me, neither.

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,416
-Relax.
-Uh, right.

151
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,916
-Ippo-kun.
-Right.

152
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,916
-You're a man, aren't you?!
-Huh?

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,916
You have to try harder than that.

154
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,166
It'll start working soon.
Do your best out there!

155
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,875
That was flawless!

156
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,958
What an awesome feint!

157
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,541
TEAM WEST GREEN ROOM

158
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,750
I hear that Makunouchi
got knocked down by Komori

159
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,541
at Ishii's gym while sparring.

160
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,250
The injury to his fist
might not be healed yet,

161
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,041
but one thing for sure is
he's not in peak condition.

162
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,958
Don't believe everything you hear.

163
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,916
He's the type who's good when it counts.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,583
I can't treat him lightly.

165
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:55,791
Yeah.

166
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,791
However, I will be the victor!

167
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:03,041
I'm not trying to act big or anything,
but I can't help feeling it's true.

168
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,458
I've never felt this great.

169
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:10,250
Energy is welling up from my very core!

170
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,208
I can't stand still.

171
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:16,083
I feel like if I don't hit something soon,
I'm going to explode!

172
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,625
The moment the bell rings, I'm going.

173
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,791
I'll have him pinned down from the get-go!

174
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,208
<i>My fist feels a little heavy,
but I feel no pain.</i>

175
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,583
<i>I've lost all sensation.</i>

176
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,291
It's almost time. Kid, let's get going!

177
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:39,875
Right!

178
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,458
<i>Now, that's a boxer.
He finally looks like a real man.</i>

179
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:55,375
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

180
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,916
Now, listen! We didn't come
all the way to Osaka

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,750
to get beaten by Sendo's cheering squad!

182
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,125
Right! Ippo's timid,

183
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:13,083
so we need to kick up a real racket
so he won't feel intimidated.

184
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,166
Look.

185
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,375
What? I didn't notice you bring that here.

186
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,083
You're really into it.

187
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,208
This'll drown out the local cheering!

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,708
The Featherweight Class
match is about to begin.

189
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,750
All right, let's do it!

190
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:33,000
Sen-do!

191
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,750
We've been waiting for this, Sendo!

192
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,916
Pulverize him!

193
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,500
Don't send him home in one piece!

194
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,000
Rocky of Naniwa!

195
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,708
Rocky! Win and buy me
that video game system!

196
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,833
Go get him, Sendo!

197
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,708
I came for this match only!

198
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,750
If we try to cheer for Ippo
in the middle of this, we'll be killed.

199
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,416
Hey, that's impressive!

200
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,250
Huh? Hey, isn't that Date?

201
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,875
You're right, it is Date!

202
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,166
What's he doing here?

203
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,041
<i>The Featherweight champion,
Eiji Date is in the crowd.</i>

204
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:18,041
Has the Rookie Championship Tournament
ever received this much attention?!

205
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,291
Wow, the champion's
at a rookie championship.

206
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,166
Oh, Ippo-kun!

207
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,333
What, this guy is his opponent?

208
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,875
Get a look at his face!

209
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,458
He's supposed to have
a heck of a punch, but Sendo's better!

210
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,916
Don't fall down too quick, okay?!

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,166
Sendo!

212
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,458
Does it bother you?

213
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,791
Sendo-san sure is popular with the crowd.

214
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,166
Yes. The entire stadium is against you.

215
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,250
But don't forget,
you have only one opponent.

216
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,166
Yes, sir.

217
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,333
Ooh, that's a good tough look!

218
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,666
That's just like him.
He blanked out the audience

219
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,708
by focusing completely on his opponent.

220
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:17,583
In the red corner, from Kamogawa Gym...

221
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,708
Ippo Makunouchi!

222
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:25,458
In the blue corner,
from the Naniwa Boxing Society...

223
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,625
Takeshi Sendo!

224
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,875
How's your right?

225
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,791
-I can't tell.
-What?

226
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:41,250
The anesthetic is working,
and there isn't any pain.

227
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,750
But I've lost my other senses as well.

228
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,416
But I think I'll know
once I throw a punch.

229
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,250
I won't change the strategy.
I'll go at him when the gong rings.

230
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:54,375
Good! For better or for worse,
do it your way!

231
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,458
Yes, sir!

232
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,791
Seconds out!

233
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,791
The problem is...

234
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,166
...how much can he use his right fist?

235
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,333
Now, the tension rises.

236
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,458
The opening bell

237
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,083
of the Featherweight Class
All-Japan Rookie Championship

238
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,208
is about to ring!

239
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,208
<i>I have to dash!</i>

240
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,541
What's wrong with him?!

241
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,500
What happened to
the Takamura gong-and-dash strategy?

242
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,041
What's wrong, Ippo?!

243
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,083
Is he feeling intimidated by
the atmosphere?

244
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,041
That's not it.

245
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,833
He's intimidated by
the man in front of him!

246
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,541
The moment the bell rang,

247
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:24,208
he released a tidal wave of pressure
to rob his opponent of his drive.

248
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:28,208
That guy is powerful.
I'm sure the kid felt it as well.

249
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,916
That's why he gave up
on charging with the bell!

250
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,208
If he had gone, he would most definitely
have fallen victim to Sendo's hammer.

251
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,500
<i>I'm at the ropes!</i>

252
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,208
<i>The pressure is intense,
not to mention that heavy jab.</i>

253
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,458
<i>There's no opening to punch!</i>

254
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,291
<i>There may not be an opening,
but I can't just guard all the time!</i>

255
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,291
<i>I have to lash out.</i>

256
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,875
<i>I should be able to reach him!</i>

257
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,000
<i>I can't stop him!</i>

258
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,375
Makunouchi is blasted backwards!

259
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,916
No wonder Sendo's so popular.

260
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,875
He's cool.

261
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,833
You idiots! No matter
how pathetic he looks,

262
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,041
our buddy is fighting out there!

263
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,291
Root for him!

264
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,458
Believe me...

265
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,541
I'd love to, but...

266
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,916
Sendo!

267
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,250
<i>Do something, Ippo!</i>

268
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,791
<i>We won't be able to raise
our voices for you at this rate.</i>

269
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,250
<i>He has incredible destructive power.</i>

270
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,250
<i>I will have to use my right after all!</i>

271
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,458
<i>It's something I've known all along!</i>

272
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,666
<i>There's no way I can face Sendo-san
without my right!</i>

273
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,583
Oh? This is a dangerous distance!

274
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,125
Makunouchi has deliberately
placed himself in the danger zone!

275
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,875
You idiot! Don't stand directly
in front of him!

276
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,416
That's too risky!

277
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,875
He knows what he has to do.
He's going to use his right.

278
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,000
He's going to punch right!
Throw that thing, kid!

279
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,125
<i>Even if I get a jab in, he'll reciprocate.</i>

280
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,750
<i>At this rate, I can't aim my right!</i>

281
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,958
This is truly a thrilling
exchange of blows!

282
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,833
Exciting offensive and defensive battle!

283
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,333
Go for the body! Stop him from moving!

284
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,083
<i>I'll stop him once, and use my right...</i>

285
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,708
You fool! Don't take blows
in the meantime!

286
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,541
Makunouchi has stopped moving!

287
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,208
Will Sendo take the offensive?!

288
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,583
Go, Sendo!

289
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,208
Knock that sucker down!

290
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,541
When it rains, it pours!
Sendo launches a barrage!

291
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,750
All right! That connected!

292
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,541
This is explosive!
Makunouchi swings a right!

293
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,541
All right! His head is clear!

294
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,541
<i>It didn't hurt. I can do this!</i>

295
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,541
He hit him without holding back, right?

296
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,958
That means...

297
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,458
Run with it, Ippo!

298
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,041
Throw your artillery at him!

299
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,541
<i>Makunouchi!</i>

300
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:43,750
<i>Okay!</i>

301
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,666
The entire stadium is dumbstruck!

302
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,375
That is just how powerful
Makunouchi's destructive power is!

303
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,291
How is Sendo holding up
after taking that full-on?!

304
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,541
<i>This will work!</i>

305
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,000
He guards! But that doesn't seem
to matter to Makunouchi!

306
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,583
It's hurting! Makunouchi is unstoppable!

307
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,750
His engine is on maximum drive!

308
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,833
Makunouchi lands a perfect left uppercut!
Sendo is in danger!

309
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,791
Oops! That's the bell!
Sendo is saved from disaster!

310
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,791
What's wrong with Rocky?

311
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,208
Is he sick?

312
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,333
It's not that. Makunouchi is too strong.

313
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,958
How's your right?

314
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,708
It's all right for now.

315
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,333
Good! Your destructive powers
are about 50-50.

316
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,041
Settle this thing
before the pain decides to come back.

317
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,125
Yes, sir!

318
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,541
He's as good a boxer as they say
if he can fight it out with you.

319
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,750
NANIWA

320
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,833
This is it.
This is what I've been waiting for.

321
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:44,416
He only has to face me,
and I can feel it like electricity.

322
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,041
I've been wanting
a fight like this forever!

323
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,208
Hey, it's okay to fight him head-on,

324
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:53,041
but if you keep taking those hard hits,
even you won't last the match.

325
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,125
That's true.

326
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,833
When I took his right,
I lost consciousness for a second.

327
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,333
When the lights came back on,
it made me think.

328
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:06,333
Maybe this is what happened
to all the guys who took a punch from <i>me</i>.

329
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,583
Sendo...

330
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,291
Seconds out!

331
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,791
I'm not chickening out or anything.
Quite the opposite.

332
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,083
My head is still spinning.

333
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,083
What shall I do about this?

334
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:26,083
Yes, what shall I do about this indeed?

335
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,625
He's calmer than I thought he'd be.

336
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,333
What? Uh, right.

337
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,666
<i>Calm? Far from it.</i>

338
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,333
<i>The look on his face made me shudder.</i>

339
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:40,833
<i>No way he'll let Ippo get away with it
after he's been beaten up that much!</i>

340
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,916
Now, round two has begun.
Sendo comes out of his corner slowly.

341
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,541
Has he recuperated? He poses at leisure.

342
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,708
Makunouchi faces him.

343
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,750
His attack at the end
of round one was superb!

344
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,583
How will he approach this round?!

345
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,291
<i>Our firing range is about the same.</i>

346
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,833
<i>I just need to get close to him.</i>

347
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,833
<i>Now, what shall I do about this?</i>

348
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,875
<i>Not yet. I need to get closer!</i>

349
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,000
<i>I need to get all over him
or I won't be satisfied.</i>

350
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,875
Sendo throws a sudden left!

351
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,375
Makunouchi is lifted into the air,
guard and all!

352
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,375
It's a hook... an uppercut!
No, it's something in-between!

353
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,500
It's a smash!

354
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,291
Ooh! It's a secret weapon!

355
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,000
That punch is amazing!

356
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,333
<i>That was close!</i>

357
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,500
<i>If I hadn't sparred with Takamura-san,
I would have taken a direct hit!</i>

358
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,833
<i>Again!</i>

359
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,583
<i>‪What?!</i>

360
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,041
<i>From below?!</i>

361
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,708
{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

362
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,375
<i>Middle-range.</i>

363
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,875
<i>The distance required
to make a large motion</i>

364
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,875
<i>in order to deliver a destructive punch.</i>

365
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:32,125
<i>A punch delivered at this range
is possibly fatal.</i>

366
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,125
<i>I have to be close.</i>

367
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,541
<i>If I take his smash full-on,</i>

368
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,666
<i>I'm sure I won't be able to keep standing!</i>

369
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,083
<i>I have to stick close to him</i>

370
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,000
<i>and continue hitting him
without giving him any leeway!</i>

371
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,500
<i>Next time, "Smash Force."</i>
