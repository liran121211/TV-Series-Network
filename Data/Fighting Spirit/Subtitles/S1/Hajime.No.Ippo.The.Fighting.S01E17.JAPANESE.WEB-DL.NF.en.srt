00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,583
{\an8}Well, then... Bye!

5
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,583
You be careful.

6
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,083
I will!

7
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,458
<i>The training camp
is finally starting today.</i>

8
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,500
<i>Takamura-san's title match is coming soon,</i>

9
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,833
<i>so I guess the camp will be pretty hard.</i>

10
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:56,958
<i>But that's what I'd rather have!
I'll never give up!</i>

11
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,458
<i>Boxing.</i>

12
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,458
Whoa!

13
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,500
It's the ocean! Takamura-san!

14
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,125
Yahoo! I'm getting fired up!

15
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,000
Wait for me! I'm coming over now!

RESTAURANT

19
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,833
We're here, guys!

20
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,208
It's been so long
since we last came to the beach!

21
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,250
It sure has!

22
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,083
Really?

23
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,500
Oh, no!

24
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,041
-Did you really say that to him?
-Of course!

25
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,541
There's no place like
the beach in summertime after all, right?

26
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,458
BEACH HOUSE MARUYAMA

27
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,791
Ah, you idiot! There is
something important in there!

28
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,958
But... this isn't fair.

29
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,500
You made me carry
all the equipment necessary for camp.

30
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,500
What rubbish are you talking about?

31
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,041
It's natural that rookies
should carry all the luggage!

32
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,541
That's not fair!

33
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:30,041
Just a little more to go.
Hang in there until we get over there.

34
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,041
Huh?

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,541
Aren't we going to the camp center?
What are we going to do over there?

36
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,625
You idiot! Changing our clothes,
of course! We're going to swim!

37
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,583
LOCKER ROOM

38
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,708
Hurry up and change

39
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,500
so that we can join the tanned ladies.

40
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,125
Takamura-san, are you already
taking off your clothes?

41
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,791
"Number one in everything" is my thing.

42
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,291
I can't let you win!

43
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,875
Look at the beautiful body
which I've been training every day!

44
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll be the center of attention
on the beach!

45
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,666
Well... what about the camp?

46
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,583
Aren't we going to train?

47
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,083
Let's see...

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,208
What?! I knew it was heavy.
It's stuffed with things like these!

49
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,375
What on earth are we here for?!

50
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,791
Don't worry, Ippo.

51
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,083
-We'll train all right. But...
-Hooray!

52
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,333
What if we train in this scorching heat
and get heatstroke?

53
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,166
Our long-awaited camp will be worthless.

54
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,333
Yes.

55
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,500
The camp is effective

56
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,291
only if you work hard
in the morning and the evening.

57
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:35,666
When you play, you play hard.
When you train, you train hard!

58
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,625
Why don't we draw a line like
the pros do, as we all are, right?

59
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,791
You're right. Drawing a line is the key.

60
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,875
Well, to tell you the truth,
it's not that I don't want to have fun.

61
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,333
All right! Then why don't
you put your swimming shorts on?

62
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,833
-We'll be waiting for you outside.
-Yes!

BEACH HOUSE MARUYAMA

64
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,000
Gee, how come he's so square?

65
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,375
It's rather bold of you to play
when there is a title match approaching.

66
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,958
-Wait a minute!
-What's wrong?

67
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,083
His swimming shorts...
He's not going to wear Speedos, is he?

68
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,333
That's not even funny.

69
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,083
Hi there! Thank you for waiting.

70
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,291
Huh?

71
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,916
Here you go!

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,333
‪Ready!

73
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,291
What a great view.

74
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,000
We have a plentiful harvest this year.

75
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh? You are brave enough
to check them out.

76
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,666
Oh, no! Not at all.

77
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,666
Hey, which one do you like?

78
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,958
Hmm... I like the one piece on the right.

79
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,625
I like the bikini on the left.
How about you?

80
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,958
What? Uh...

81
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,791
I like the girl in the middle.

82
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,333
Wow, he chose the most risqué one.

83
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,958
-Hey!
-Ouch...

84
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,416
-You are a man!
-Ouch!

85
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,083
My taste is...

86
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:04,791
She is the one!

87
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:06,875
Here!

88
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,625
Hey, you! Do something about
your misaligned taste?

89
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,541
What?!

90
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,375
Ippo! Give us a hand!
We're going to bury him!

91
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,125
<i>This is so much fun.</i>

92
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,500
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

93
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,291
<i>I've never come out to
the beach with my friends.</i>

94
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:32,708
All right! Why don't we get serious
and go grab us some girls?

95
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:33,916
Yes, sir.

96
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,458
<i>Could he possibly mean "picking-up girls"?</i>

97
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,125
<i>What should I do?</i>

98
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,166
<i>I wonder... Should I follow them for now?</i>

99
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,750
Starting over there, shall we?

100
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,375
-They look pretty good.
-Looking great.

101
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,625
You are... staying here!

102
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,250
They are really selfish.

103
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,458
Hey, kid! Wake up!

104
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,791
What?

105
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,291
Chief?!

106
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,916
Are you still dreaming or what?
Look ahead!

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,500
Ahead?

108
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,583
Hayami-san!

109
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,041
Miyata-kun!

110
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,750
Ugh... wait...

111
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,000
Wait!

112
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,458
It was a dream.

113
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,458
<i>While I'm here,
those who are stronger than me</i>

114
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,500
<i>are getting even stronger.</i>

115
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,458
I have to train...

116
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:56,041
Damn! I had no luck with any of the girls!

117
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,625
Well, we still have tomorrow.

118
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,625
Huh? They are all dressed.

119
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,291
Stop mumbling and get yourself ready.
We're going to start training!

120
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,875
Uh... yes!

121
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,541
We're going to do some dash and dart!

122
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,791
Yes, sir!

123
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,458
<i>They're fast! It's so hard
to run on the sand, though.</i>

124
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,166
Hey, Ippo! Keep right up with us!

125
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,250
Yes!

126
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,666
Now!

127
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,250
<i>Ugh... I can't keep up with them at all.</i>

128
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,875
<i>It's not like this on the riverbank
where we usually run.</i>

129
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,666
<i>Why are they so fast?</i>

130
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,583
<i>This time their dash is particularly long.</i>

131
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,833
<i>Though they were
playing around during the day,</i>

132
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,916
<i>they still have such energy.</i>

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,375
<i>After all, these guys are impressive.</i>

134
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,625
<i>Were they possibly...
dashing toward their butts?</i>

135
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,958
-Whoa! Takamura-san, look at them!
-Whoa!

136
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,458
-All right, we're going, guys!
-Yes, sir!

137
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,791
We can get ourselves fired up

138
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,875
when we find the joy in training, huh?

139
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,958
I will keep running
as long as there is a goal!

140
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,541
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

141
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,208
<i>How serious are they? Really...</i>

142
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,166
Hey, keep it up, Ippo.

143
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,166
A little more to go
till the training center.

144
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,958
<i>I'll be fine as long as there is a futon.</i>

145
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,958
<i>I'll have a good night's sleep tonight.</i>

146
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,583
Wow, it's a nice facility!

147
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,125
This might be more
impressive than Kamogawa Gym.

148
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,291
Well, then shall we start now?

149
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,583
Yes, sir!

150
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,875
They ran that much and yet
they're still going to practice more!

151
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,208
Shadow boxing! Five rounds!

152
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,583
What? Five rounds!

153
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,083
Rather, five sets!

154
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:01,916
{\an8}Begin!

155
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,291
<i>They are doing it totally unfazed.</i>

156
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,291
<i>They're amazing.</i>

157
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,416
All right!

158
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,958
All right. Let's get rest
for tomorrow's training.

159
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,166
We trained pretty hard
for the very first day.

160
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,416
I'm a little beat.

161
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,958
What? That was nothing.

162
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,416
That was just the beginning.

163
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,916
I... I can get to sleep, finally.

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,833
What?

165
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,416
Hey, you're retiring
for the night before us?

166
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,541
What are you doing?

167
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,375
For such bad behavior, you deserve this!

168
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,125
Hey!

169
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,166
We're starting early tomorrow .

170
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,625
This is not a school trip.

171
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,500
Don't be fooling around forever!

172
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,666
You... you're right.

173
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,291
<i>Takamura-san is kind.</i>

174
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,041
<i>But... I can't... get out of this.</i>

175
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,250
Did you just see my suplex?!

176
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,583
-Hey, he's not moving.
-This could be really bad.

177
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,541
Next we'll do a DDT!

178
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,083
Ippo!

179
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,541
All right! Ippo,
feel free to step in and punch me!

180
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,541
Today I'll pretend to be Hayami.
Keep punching as if I'm him.

181
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes, sir!

182
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,625
What's up? I'm over here.

183
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,958
<i>Damn!</i>

184
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,875
What's up?! You are not keeping up
with me at all.

185
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,875
The way you are,
you can't possibly catch Hayami!

186
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,208
Oh, come on.

187
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,833
That kid has trouble with out-boxers.

188
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:08,166
Huh? But he beat Miyata.

189
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,541
More accurately, he doesn't fight well

190
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,708
against a boxer who moves away
with good footwork.

191
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,958
Miyata was coming forward hitting,
though he boasted excellent footwork.

192
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,666
At a distance, Ippo's powerful punch...

193
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,666
will be nothing but a shot in the air.

194
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,958
I see.

195
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,666
Not a single punch connected

196
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,333
but I will catch him
for sure in the next round!

197
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,958
-No use.
-What?

198
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,833
If you're saying such a thing,
you will surely lose against Hayami.

199
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,125
Don't say that, please!

200
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,041
Well, if we fight now,
I may have no chance of winning,

201
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,333
but I will work hard!

202
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,833
Even so, you will lose.

203
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,625
How come?

204
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:49,291
Because you have
a crucial weakness in your boxing.

205
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,333
A crucial... weakness?

206
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:03,000
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

207
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,333
So... what is it?
What is my crucial weakness?

208
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,375
Listen, your weakness is...

209
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:15,666
these!

210
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,625
You mean toes?

211
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,541
That's right, it's your toes!

212
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,333
Your toes are weapons
as important as your fists for a boxer.

213
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,708
You have weak toes,

214
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,708
which means you haven't
trained them enough.

215
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,750
<i>They're as important as my fists...</i>

216
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,375
But I didn't mean to tell
you to do a kneel kick or rolling sobat.

217
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,708
I... I know that.

218
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,208
Excuse me, Takamura-san!

219
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,291
What is it? You're too loud!

220
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,416
Ippo's speed of dashing
and reaching the opponent's side

221
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,291
is pretty advanced for a four-round match.

222
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,125
Doesn't that mean
his toes are somewhat strong?

223
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,625
Sure. But that was
only limited to straight lines.

224
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,166
When it comes to shifting the weight,
he is no good!

225
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,708
Shifting weight?

226
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,125
Where is your center of gravity
when doing that?

227
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,375
Oh, it's my toes!

228
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Exactly! The speed for
dashing and shifting your weight

229
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,625
all comes from your toes.

230
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,708
But as I told you before,
your toes are weak!

231
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,041
You are slow in shifting

232
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,541
your weight, which means each action
is delayed by one notch.

233
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,791
That's why even
Kimura's footwork can shove you.

234
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,291
<i>Even mine?</i>

235
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,791
Hayami's legs are
probably faster than Kimura's.

236
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,250
You need to somehow build up on your toes

237
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,791
so that you can keep up
with him by the time of the match.

238
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,041
What's wrong?

239
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,583
Uh... well... I think it's amazing that you

240
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,041
figured that out just
by taking a look at the way I spar.

241
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,291
Not just your sparring.

242
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,000
You couldn't keep up with us
during the running at the beach.

243
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,208
That's because your last kick
is not hard enough.

244
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,958
You can't tell on the usual road,

245
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:56,833
but such a difference shows
where your foothold is not secure.

246
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:00,333
Well, when your toes become like these,
you are a full-fledged boxer.

247
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,666
Whoa, you've got a huge blister!

248
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,791
At first, it was like a grain of rice,

249
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,666
but it's peeled off so many times
that it has become like this.

250
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,375
May I touch it?

251
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,583
Sure!

252
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,500
Are you teasing me or what?

253
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,625
I'm sorry!

254
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,958
<i>The toes</i>...

255
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,375
<i>But how do I actually train them?</i>

256
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,625
Hey, Ippo!

257
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,583
Let's do interesting training with this.

258
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,500
What? Tennis balls?

259
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,333
Well, I'm going to throw them
to your left and right.

260
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,958
Just catch it
before it drops on the floor.

261
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,208
-Um...yes...
-All right. Here we go!

262
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,833
I won't necessarily throw them
in the order of right and left.

263
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,041
Okay.

264
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,875
All right, here we go next!

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,166
-Hey, you're not fully catching up.
-Right!

266
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,583
What do you think?
This is pretty tough, isn't it?

267
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,166
This is very...

268
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,333
Well, something like this
won't get rid of your weakness,

269
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,375
but I'm sure it will
alleviate it a little.

270
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,875
You will learn how to shift
your weight naturally as well.

271
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,333
Well? Do you like it?

272
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,291
Yes, please continue.

273
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,500
All right! Here you go!

274
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,541
Yes!

275
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,791
All right! The morning session is over!
We're going to the beach!

276
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,791
Yes, sir!

277
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,416
<i>My... legs are so stiff!</i>

278
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,291
<i>But I won't give up.
I'm going to get over my weakness!</i>

279
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,000
All right. Break time!

280
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,708
<i>I'm getting used to
this practice to a great extent.</i>

281
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,750
Dash!

282
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,208
Yes, sir!

283
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,750
<i>Kick with your toes! Kick!</i>

284
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,416
Aoki, Kimura! We're going to
show him his seniors' true power.

285
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,875
How is it? Ippo won't
be able to catch up with us!

286
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,458
Takamura-san. Aoki can't catch up
with us either.

287
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,750
What?

288
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,041
There!

289
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,083
Humph! Don't take our real power lightly!

290
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,666
Don't say "our"! Not "our"!

291
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,666
{\an8}IT'S THE END! LAST DAY!

292
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,166
What?

293
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,458
We're not done yet!

294
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,666
Ah! It's over!

295
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,583
We've done everything
on the training list.

296
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:18,541
<i>The training camp is over now.
I kind of feel a little sad.</i>

297
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,791
Huh? Are we still going to do something?

298
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,125
Huh?

299
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,791
FIREWORKS

300
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,375
{\an8}Nothing is over until we do this!

301
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,416
Such a tiny one doesn't fit my character!

302
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,208
Isn't there anything flashier?

303
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:49,458
What? But you always said
there is an order for fireworks.

304
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,291
Shut up. That's when I'm with a woman.

305
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,875
Whoa! This... is huge.

306
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,500
Let's name this "Ippo Fireworks."

307
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,625
-Now, here we go!
-Yes, sir.

308
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,791
This is going to be a big one!

309
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:16,416
{\an8}MAIKUTAISON (MIKE TYSON)

310
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,958
{\an8}What?! It's stale!

311
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,750
Damn! The Ippo firework
is big in size, but useless.

312
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,458
This is embarrassing,
so please don't call it my name.

313
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,125
Takamura-san. This one seems to be okay.

314
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,666
Wow!

315
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,416
<i>We'll be back in Tokyo tomorrow morning.</i>

316
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,666
<i>This is really
the end of the training camp.</i>

317
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:57,166
Takamura-san. When we go back to Tokyo,
it'll be your title match.

318
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,833
If you win, you will be
the grand champion of Japan. That's great.

319
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,250
The title of the Japanese championship
is just a milestone.

320
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,625
For me, there is only one goal.

321
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,666
It's the world championship!

322
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,958
No matter what big talk Takamura-san says,
it doesn't sound like bluffing.

323
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,291
The scale of his dream
has no comparison to ours.

324
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:31,375
All right! Why don't we aim for
the Japanese championship title too?

325
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,416
Yeah! We've come to the eighth round!

326
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,333
It's reality!

327
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,958
Wait for me, champion belt!

328
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,458
I'll put it on my waist for sure!

329
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,083
<i>I'm going to aim for
Rookie of the Year too!</i>

330
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:01,958
What?!

331
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,125
The Ippo firework is
starting to work <i>now</i>?!

332
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,791
I told you not to call it my name!

333
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:13,625
Ippo, take the blame and go put it out!

334
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,750
You're the one who lit it!
You can't be serious!

335
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,625
Hey, do something about it! Come on!

336
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,416
<i>A fight plan.
Collecting information steadily,</i>

337
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,166
<i>building up the research...</i>

338
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,000
<i>perfecting the winning strategy.</i>

339
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,500
<i>There is no use for fear.</i>

340
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:47,083
<i>All I can do is to fight in my own way.</i>

341
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,416
<i>With my trained feet,</i>

342
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,166
<i>I will reach out to the opponent's body
and pull us into close range.</i>

343
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,416
<i>I'm sure that will help me cut my way.</i>

344
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:57,375
<i>Next time, "Clinch."</i>
