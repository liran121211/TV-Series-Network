00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,791
{\an8}Sendo! Where's Sendo?

5
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,708
It's time for his roadwork.
Where the heck has he gone?

6
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,791
If you want Sendo-san,
he went in the back.

7
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,083
The back?

8
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,958
You're watching it again.

9
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,541
Yeah.

10
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,916
I could watch this guy fight
over and over without getting bored.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,958
I'm totally stoked
that I get to fight him.

12
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,416
Yes, about that...

13
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,708
What? What the heck do you mean?!

14
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,500
It's like I just explained...

15
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,125
Hey! Where are you going?

16
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,291
Where else?!

17
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,125
To Tokyo!

ROCKY OF NANIWA

{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

20
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,958
Hello.

21
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,625
There you are. You have a guest.

22
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,583
Who is that?

23
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,833
He's been demanding to see you
since he got here.

24
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,750
Huh?

25
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:51,500
Oh? So, you finally showed up, Makunouchi.

26
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,750
I've been waiting.

27
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:57,750
Um, I'm sorry I kept you waiting,
but may I ask who you are?

28
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,875
What's that? You're saying
you don't know who I am?!

29
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:01,958
Well, yes.

30
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,250
Fine. I'll introduce myself.

31
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,291
My name is Takeshi Sendo!

32
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,458
I'm Western Japan's
featherweight rookie champion.

33
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,500
Rookie champion of Western Japan?!

34
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,875
Sendo? I've heard of you.

35
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,791
You're the one featured in magazines

36
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,666
as Kansai's number one rising star.

37
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,000
You're Rocky of Naniwa?!

38
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:24,666
People always want to call you "Rocky"
so-and-so if you're a little tough.

39
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,541
They think the movie "Rocky" was so cool,

40
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,458
so I understand why they want
to add the name of our town to it,

41
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,708
but don't get the wrong idea!

42
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,291
I'm not nicknamed after any Rocky Balboa.

43
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,875
It's Rocky as in "Rocky Marciano."

44
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,625
Rocky Marciano?

45
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,750
The only champion to retire undefeated
in the history of the heavyweight class.

46
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:49,375
You got it!
49 matches, 49 victories, and 43 KOs!

47
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,541
In a nutshell, Marciano was the only

48
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,958
class champion
without any losses or draws!

49
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,333
But it gets even more amazing.

50
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,500
Boxers nowadays tend to compete
with skills alone, right?

51
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,000
However, Marciano was different.

52
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,208
He would see who was more powerful.

53
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,916
Who could withstand the most punches!

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Testing to see who was
a man among men was his religion!

55
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,791
Don't you think that's awesome?

56
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,916
That's how I want to live.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,083
But I'm disgusted with
the Western Japan Tournament.

58
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,041
Every last one of them use cheap tricks

59
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,041
and they all fall on their asses
after one little punch.

60
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,458
Just when I was bored sick of it,

61
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,541
I saw your video tape.

62
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,458
My tape?

63
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,375
I knew you were the one.

64
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,041
I knew that with you,

65
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,000
I'd be able to have
real man-to-man boxing!

66
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,458
So, what's this crap
I hear about you withdrawing?!

67
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,916
Don't wimp out over a little fist injury,
and do the All-Japan!

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,791
That's easy for you to say...

69
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,416
Are you a man or a mouse?!

70
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,500
I even worked on a deadly technique
to fight you with!

71
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,333
A deadly technique?

72
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,500
Actually, it's still a secret.
I haven't made it public yet.

73
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:58,250
Still, my smash would knock
anyone's socks off.

74
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,416
Smash?

75
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,125
What?! You can do smashes?

76
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,500
If memory serves,
it's a three-quarter uppercut, right?

77
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,750
D'oh!

78
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,083
Oh, nuts! I spilled the beans!

79
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,208
Please keep this a secret, okay?

80
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,500
Pardon?

81
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,416
Oh, well. The cat is out of the bag,
so to hell with it.

82
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,875
The match is more important anyway.

83
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,000
Are you going to back out of All-Japan?

84
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,666
Yeah, but I can't use my right fist,

85
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,875
so it wouldn't be much of a match.

86
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,041
You'll be healed in two months, right?!
It'll be in time!

87
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,458
Don't ask the impossible!

88
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,958
I know you came all the way from Osaka,

89
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,625
but Ippo is in no shape
to fight in the match.

90
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,125
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,333
Damn it all!

92
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,791
I need to get going.

93
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,833
Huh? Where are you off to?

94
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,333
It's time for me to do roadwork.

95
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,458
Roadwork?

96
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,166
Come to think of it...

97
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,708
I hopped the train
when I was supposed to do roadwork.

98
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,500
I need to run anyway.

99
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,166
I see.

100
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,875
Dashing, huh?

101
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,916
What, are you through already?

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,916
Actually, I alternate
between dashing and jogging.

103
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,875
Oh... Why didn't you say so?

104
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,666
You sure run a lot.

105
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,916
Thanks.

106
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,750
<i>I can't train my fists,</i>

107
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:45,250
<i>so I run twice the norm,
but he kept up with me no problem.</i>

108
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,541
<i>I bet he does this much
on a regular basis.</i>

109
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,083
Yes?

110
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,000
So, you're really going to back out?

111
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,125
I guess I should give up
and stop nagging you.

112
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,708
I'm disappointed
because I was looking forward to it.

113
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,208
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,416
Don't apologize.

115
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,625
Some things just can't be helped.

116
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,125
<i>This guy was seriously
looking forward to fighting me.</i>

117
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,125
<i>He must really love boxing.</i>

118
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:28,166
Um, so how did you start boxing?

119
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:29,875
Huh?

120
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,416
Uh, well... I was just a little curious.

121
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,416
You probably think I was a street brat
who liked to mix it up.

122
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,458
Uh...

123
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,458
And that I started boxing
because I was influenced by it.

124
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,750
Uh, I didn't really...

125
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,125
Really?

126
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,250
Well, maybe just a little.

127
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,666
I knew it!

128
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,791
I'll have you know I can't stand it
when people judge me like that!

129
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:53,750
Yes, sir.

130
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,916
-Now, listen to me!
-Yes, sir!

131
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,583
I started boxing...

132
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,958
because I love boxing!

133
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,916
That's why I started boxing!

134
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,416
Aw, man! I sound just like a street brat.

135
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,375
I know!

136
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,416
Ask a mountain climber
why he climbs mountains,

137
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,583
he'll say, "Because there are
mountains to climb."

138
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,916
-It's like that!
-Pardon?

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,666
Wait, I can describe it better!

140
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,250
Yeah! If you're a boxer,
you'll know what I'm talking about!

141
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,125
If there's a tough guy in the ring,
you want to fight him, right?

142
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,875
You want to have
a ferocious battle of the fists...

143
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,833
and win! Then I can believe
from the bottom of my heart

144
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,791
that I am strong.

145
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,750
I love that moment!

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,708
If I could fight you...

147
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,291
I wasted my time.

148
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm going to catch a shower
and get myself back to Osaka.

149
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,458
Oh, man! All that trouble for nothing!

150
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,750
<i>My punches are dynamite!</i>

151
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,000
<i>Vroom!</i>

152
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,000
Yo!

153
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,750
-Afternoon!
-Hello!

154
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,500
Where the heck is Aoki?

155
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,125
Oh, if you want Aoki-san...

156
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,000
He's in there!

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He's in the washroom.

158
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,250
Aoki!

159
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,541
<i>It... It's huge!</i>

160
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,250
<i>This thing is freakishly huge!</i>

161
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,000
You! You're definitely not Aoki,
so who the hell are you?!

162
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,291
Don't do that to a guy out of nowhere!

163
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,750
You were about to crush it.

164
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,791
What? I haven't seen you before.

165
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:58,083
If you're a newbie,
you are obliged to greet me!

166
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,875
<i>Hey, it's Takamura-san,
the middleweight champion!</i>

167
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,000
<i>I'm a big fan of his.</i>

168
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,875
<i>I wonder if I can get his autograph?</i>

169
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,500
Huh?

170
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,916
Don't size me up, you!

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Mine has more destructive power!

172
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,000
What the hell are you doing?!

173
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,583
What's wrong, Takamura-san?!

174
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,250
What are you guys doing together naked?

175
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,750
Yeesh. I feel pathetic
for rushing to your rescue.

176
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,125
Shut your face!

177
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,833
It's your fault I ended up gripping
that nasty thing!

178
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:34,250
<i>Is that Aoki guy always treated like that?</i>

179
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,291
Well, thanks for everything.

180
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,875
What? You're going back already?

181
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,500
I need to train.

182
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,291
{\an8}And I already got an autograph.

183
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,250
{\an8}MAMORU TAKAMURA,
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD

184
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,666
Besides, there's nothing left
for me to do here.

185
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:50,750
Sendo-san?

186
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:56,250
What? You don't need me
around anymore either, right?

187
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,291
Well, so long!

188
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,041
The guy's like a whirlwind.

189
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,500
Heh! I went through hell thanks to him.

190
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,500
What is it now?!

191
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Looking back...

192
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,125
I only had enough money
to buy a one-way ticket.

193
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,333
Would you let me stay the night here?

ROCKY OF NANIWA, TAKESHI SENDO

196
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,291
<i>This is amazing.</i>

197
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,125
<i>He's been in the public eye
ever since his debut.</i>

198
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,250
<i>Flat-footed infighter...</i>

199
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,791
{\an8}<i>Six matches, six wins, six KOs!</i>

200
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,666
{\an8}<i>Wow, that's just like me!</i>

201
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,625
<i>"His defense has room for improvement,</i>

202
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,416
<i>but his destructive power
more than makes up for it."</i>

203
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
<i>"He is one of the top notch hard punchers
in the featherweight class."</i>

204
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,666
<i>We're the same!</i>

205
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,500
<i>Not just our match records,
but the way we fight and win.</i>

206
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:59,041
<i>The praise in his article
reads a lot like the praise in mine.</i>

207
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:04,041
<i>Could it be that we're
the exact same type of boxer?</i>

208
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:11,000
<i>Come to think of it,
I've never fought a boxer like myself.</i>

209
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,250
<i>I wonder what would happen</i>...

210
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,666
<i>if I fought him?</i>

211
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:26,791

KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,083
<i>The fledglings are working hard today.</i>

214
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:34,833
-Afternoon.
-Hello!

215
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,833
<i>Is that a new trainee?</i>

216
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,583
<i>He's making sweet music
with the heavy bag.</i>

217
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,791
Hey, you!

218
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,291
You have good form,
but try raising your guard a bit more.

219
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,041
<i>It's Chief Kamogawa,</i>

220
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,083
<i>the genius trainer
who made a boxer out of Takamura-san!</i>

221
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,583
Like this, sir?

222
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:04,250
Yes... you've got potential.

223
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,625
Do you really think so?!

224
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,583
However, when you step in,
it throws off your body axis.

225
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,500
It's slightly slowing down your combo.

226
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,291
What? So, I should do this?

227
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,625
No, you should position
your head like this...

228
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,375
Old man! Why the hell are
you giving advice to the enemy?!

229
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,541
Huh? What are you talking about?

230
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,791
Oh, so you're Sendo
from the Western Japan Block.

231
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,208
That explains why you looked so good.

232
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,000
Are you still here?!

233
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,625
It only took you a day to fit in.

234
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,083
What, do you really think so?

235
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,875
So you came to discuss
the match with the kid.

236
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,083
I'm sorry you came all this way,
but give up.

237
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,958
The injury to his fist is serious.
If he strains it now,

238
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,416
he could be out
for more than just a couple months.

239
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,375
If you're a boxer,
you'll understand that, right?

240
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,291
Here. It's your return fare.

241
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,875
I'm sorry, but I have no more time
to play with you.

242
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,708
Let's go, Yagi-chan.

243
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:57,833
Coming.

244
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,333
Hey, where are you guys
going off to together?

245
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,708
To Thailand.

246
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,833
We couldn't find you a challenger
here in Japan, Takamura-kun.

247
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,750
We heard Thailand has good boxers,
so we're going there to negotiate.

248
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,583
I'd take on the world title
at the drop of a hat, you know?

249
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,583
There's an order to everything.
We'll bring you back good news!

250
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,083
So, my next victim is a Thai.

251
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,083
All right! Aoki, let's kick it up
a notch and spar!

252
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,708
Who, me?!

253
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,250
In my humble opinion,
Kimura looks more Thai-like than me.

254
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,083
Why are you making up excuses?

255
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,166
You do it!

256
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,666
I don't want to die just yet!

257
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,583
-Stop fighting over me!
-Hey, Makunouchi?

258
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,625
Is he the only heavyweight in this gym?

259
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,583
Yeah. The heaviest person
next to Takamura-san

260
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,583
is Aoki-san, who's a lightweight.

261
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,541
<i>A challenger is one thing,</i>

262
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,083
<i>but he doesn't even
have a sparring partner?</i>

263
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,083
Excuse me!

264
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,541
I need to borrow your spare gym shirt.

265
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,291
Sure. Help yourself!

266
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,583
If you're cool with it, I'll help you out.

267
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,583
What?!

268
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,583
You're going to do it?

269
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,333
You're a featherweight, aren't you?!

270
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,583
Do you realize how many classes
are between you two?

271
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:09,041
He gave me so much money,
I should at least offer my services.

272
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,250
Besides, it means I'll get to spar
with my hero, Takamura-san.

273
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,208
It'll make a great story to tell the guys.

274
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,083
Ooh, you're a smooth talker!

275
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,875
Not everyone gets the opportunity
to spar with a guy like me,

276
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,291
so make sure to take lots of notes.

277
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,291
Yes. I fully intend to.

278
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,791
Listen. One round only, okay?

279
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,583
One round and no more, okay?

280
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:34,875
It'd really suck if we hurt an outsider
while the Chief is gone.

281
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,291
Yeah. I know.

282
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,458
Aoki is a total worrywart.

283
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,958
There's no way he'd take him full-on.

284
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,166
And Sendo is just curious.

285
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,916
He won't try to incite him.

286
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,291
I only hope you're right.

287
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,833
Damn. No matter what happens,
I'm not responsible.

288
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,500
Hey, that's unusual.

289
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,416
Takamura-san is in a tight fighting pose.

290
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,208
He usually has his guard lowered
to focus on offense.

291
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,250
He's trying to give Sendo a lesson.

292
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,375
Oh, right!

293
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,166
<i>He's intimidating all right.</i>

294
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,916
<i>This is a great experience for me.</i>

295
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,625
He's fast!

296
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,125
There he goes.

297
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,916
What heinous jabs for 16-ounce gloves!

298
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,416
So, that was his firing range.

299
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,041
It comes as no surprise
that he can't touch Takamura-san,

300
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,041
but still, his moves are pretty sharp.

301
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,250
-Yes.
-Hey, look!

302
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,583
Isn't Sendo getting
a little too worked up?

303
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,958
Don't worry. They're
on totally different levels.

304
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,708
Dodge with your upper body,
then as the opponent withdraws,

305
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,041
dive in for the punch! Rock-away!

306
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,958
Counter a counter
with a counter... Crisscross.

307
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,250
Whoa! High-level techniques on parade!

308
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,041
This sure is educational.

309
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,041
Yeah.

310
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,791
Look how good he is
without going all the way.

311
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,666
-What? Did he hit him?
-No.

312
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,666
Hey, you used your elbow. Watch it.

313
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,666
-I did it on purpose.
-What?

314
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:48,833
What's going on?!

315
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,041
He suddenly got mad!

316
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,291
This is bad! Let's stop them!

317
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,791
Enough, Sendo! You can't touch him anyway!

318
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:08,125
<i>That's true... if I was going
to throw a normal punch at him.</i>

319
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,166
A hook! No... An upper?!

320
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,666
<i>What an ill-defined stance.</i>

321
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,666
No way!

322
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,416
A smash!

323
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,166
-Takamura-san's body...
-...moved!

324
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,166
<i>That was a tricky little punch</i>...

325
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,166
...you little shit!

326
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,666
Hey, Sendo!

327
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,625
Sendo-san!

328
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,666
Is he dead?!

329
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,166
Damn, that hurt!

330
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,666
If you had a smash up your sleeve,
you should've said so!

331
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,208
It was so unexpected that I took one.

332
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,958
Didn't I ask you not to go nuts?!

333
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,000
It's his fault!

334
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,500
He said it wouldn't make

335
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,416
a good story for the guys
unless real boxing was involved.

336
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,666
<i>So that's what he said!</i>

337
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,875
I don't know whether
that was brave or just plain stupid,

338
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:24,208
but either way, it's impressive
that he made Takamura-san go all-out.

339
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,666
Hey, someone get some water!

340
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,166
I'll go!

341
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,291
<i>Real boxing, huh?</i>

342
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:39,166
<i>Different class levels
don't mean anything to Sendo-san.</i>

343
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,916
<i>He does it because he wants
to fight someone strong, that's all.</i>

344
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,666
If you're up against a tough guy,
you want to fight him ...

345
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,083
and win!

346
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:54,125
I love that moment!

347
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,541
<i>He really loves boxing.</i>

348
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,208
<i>I don't want to lose.</i>

349
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,291
You sure bought a lot!

350
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,958
Yeah, I just took off,

351
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,083
so I needed some souvenirs
to smooth it over with my trainer.

352
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,166
If you ever come to
Tokyo again, drop on by.

353
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,291
And next time, I'll spar with you.

354
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,291
Thanks.

355
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,291
Sendo?

356
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,291
I'll be waiting in Osaka!

357
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,458
Sendo-san.

358
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,166
So, he'll be waiting in Osaka, huh?

359
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,000
The All-Japan RCT alternates
between the east and west.

360
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,166
This year's will be in the west,
at the Osaka Prefecture Gymnasium.

361
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,750
It doesn't look like he's given up
on his match with you.

362
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,666
He's not the only one.

363
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:27,125
<i>My passion for boxing is
no less than anybody else's.</i>

364
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,833
<i>I want to fight him.</i>

365
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,250
<i>I don't want to lose!</i>

366
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,833
<i>Takamura-san really is powerful.</i>

367
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,333
<i>I'd been working on my smash
to be a single, fatal blow.</i>

368
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,083
<i>It's a do-or-die kind of punch,
so if you fail to knock him down</i>

369
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,166
<i>the first time,
there's the danger of a revenge hit.</i>

370
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,291
<i>I need to iron the bugs out
the moment I get back to Osaka.</i>

371
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,458
<i>What a great souvenir that was!</i>

372
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,291
Souvenirs!

373
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,791
{\an8}TOKYO

374
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:15,291
{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

375
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,291
<i>Hard puncher.</i>

376
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,041
<i>A boxer with a superior punch.</i>

377
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:31,083
<i>While his destructive punches
could result in dramatic victories,</i>

378
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:34,625
<i>he is prone to injuring his fists
from his own destructive power.</i>

379
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,375
<i>I know full well that a fist injury
could mess up my hand.</i>

380
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,208
<i>But I don't want to use
that as an excuse to give up!</i>

381
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,208
<i>If I can be in the match,
I don't want to run away!</i>

382
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,750
<i>Next time, "To Enemy Ground."</i>
