00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,305
{\an8}JAPAN MIDDLEWEIGHT TITLE MATCH
YOSHIAKI YAJIMA VS. MAMORU TAKAMURA

5
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:40,016
{\an8}Takamura-san looks so cool!

6
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,560
Japan Middleweight Title Match!

7
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,355
When you see something like this,
it feels so real.

8
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,815
Good luck, Takamura-kun.

9
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,735
Bring back the first champion belt
to our gym in ten years.

10
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,322
In return, Yagi-chan, don't forget to
plan a banquet to celebrate my victory.

11
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,406
Of course I won't!

12
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,784
All right!

13
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,538
First one in ten years?!

14
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,581
Do your best, Takamura-san.

15
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,875
I'll cheer for you
on the day of your match!

16
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,502
Hey, Ippo.

17
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:11,422
You'll need to pour all you've got
into this one, not cheering. See?

18
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,799
EASTERN JAPAN ROOKIE CHAMPIONSHIP
KENTA KOBASHI VS. IPPO MAKUNOUCHI

19
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,759
It's... <i>my</i> match.

20
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,971
So, Ippo's match is a curtain raiser
for Takamura-san's match.

21
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,932
That's perfect! Your opponent
is that wimpy Kobashi.

22
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,435
Your victory will give a welcome boost
to Takamura-san's title match!

23
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,522
Um... well... don't say that.
There's no guarantee that I'll win.

24
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,190
What are you saying?

25
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,109
You did watch that video, didn't you?

26
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,861
Yeah. It'll be nothing but a free pass.

27
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,779
What's concerning is Hayami.

28
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,323
Oh, no. I can't be too optimistic!

29
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,825
I'll do my best for each match.

30
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:43,204
Oh, man! Give me a break!
You're way too serious!

31
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,373
Well, that's what's great about you.

32
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,208
All right. Get up in the ring.

33
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,793
Let's review what we've learned.

34
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,837
Yes, sir! Thank you very much!

35
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:56,801
CLINCH

00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,555
{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

37
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,780
What are you doing?

38
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,490
Once again your left is wide open!

39
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,749
<i>All four of them are looking crisp.</i>

40
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,084
<i>The results of the camp are
showing in their movement.</i>

41
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,548
<i>Especially the kid.</i>

42
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,134
<i>His power to kick off
the ground has gotten stronger.</i>

43
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:43,348
<i>Shifting his weight has become extremely
smooth compared to how it was before.</i>

44
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,562
<i>It was the right decision to make
him go to the camp with the other guys.</i>

45
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,026
Okay. It was nice.

46
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,653
Thank you very much.

47
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,490
<i>I need to concentrate more and more.</i>

48
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,658
Hey, Ippo!

49
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,909
-Yes.
-Here!

50
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,748
-Good response!
-Well, thank you.

51
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,793
Incidentally... could you go
buy me some juice?

52
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,169
I want some orange juice.

53
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,754
Five hundred yen.

54
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,759
It has become a habit to jump and catch
when something is tossed to me.

55
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,347
Huh?

56
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,644
<i>I wonder if he wants to join the gym.</i>

57
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,562
<i>I'm sure it's hard for him to enter.</i>

58
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,898
<i>I really understand how it feels.</i>

59
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,651
<i>I wonder if I should have told him
to take a tour inside.</i>

60
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,370
<i>Ah! He scared me! He came out so suddenly!</i>

61
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,956
Please wait!

62
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,250
Makunouchi-kun!

63
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,587
Wait! This... notebook!

64
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,550
-You dropped it!
-Ugh! Oh, man!

65
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,176
What am I going to do?

66
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,725
Finally... I caught up with you. Here it is.

67
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,606
<i>I wonder what's wrong with him?</i>

68
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,619
I didn't want you to see this.

69
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,620
Huh?

70
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,125
You must think me petty to spy on you
while we're still in the four-round level.

71
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,044
What? Spy?

72
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,130
<i>I wonder what this guy is talking about.</i>

73
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,467
<i>Is he talking about
looking into the gym earlier?</i>

74
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:51,017
-Kobashi-san!
-You've <i>just</i> noticed?

75
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,937
-Then the contents of this?
-No! I haven't looked!

76
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,357
I see. Of course.

77
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,445
Otherwise, there's no way you'd
go out of your way to deliver it to me.

78
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,784
The reputation is well founded.
Your punches are incredible.

79
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,744
Uh... well...

80
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:14,290
I really wish I had punches like yours.

81
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,251
In order to compensate
for the lack of destructive power,

82
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,629
I need to make efforts of my own.

83
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,965
I've watched your videotapes
until they're worn out.

84
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,593
I also watched your training
for a long time.

85
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,678
This is one of the results of my efforts.

86
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,515
Um... well... I...

87
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,852
You were kind
enough to deliver this to me.

88
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,021
But I've started in with you... Sorry.

89
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,397
Oh, not at all.

90
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,485
It doesn't mean a thing
unless I give you a bad time in the ring.

91
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,113
Makunouchi-kun,

92
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:49,283
I have no flashy punches or
incredible technique that I can show off

93
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,370
but still, boxing is not predictable.

94
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,629
What? Kobashi came to spy on you?!

95
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:05,174
He seems to be taking notes and analyzing.

96
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,094
He sounded really confident
and now I'm a little anxious.

97
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,347
He's nothing but a boxer with cold feet,
relying solely on clinches.

98
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,267
You have nothing to worry about.

99
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,393
He's a piece of cake!

100
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,896
You think so? What do you think,
Takamura-san?

101
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,108
-The only thing I can say is...
-Yes!

102
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,195
I won't allow you to lose
as a curtain-raiser to my match!

103
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,407
-Kid!
-Yes, sir!

104
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,742
Don't worry too much about your opponent.

105
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,412
Instead, think of taking advantage
of your destructive power!

106
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,705
Yes!

107
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,916
OHTAKI BOXING GYM

108
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,093
Hey, Kobashi! You're doing
the clinch again?

109
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,429
If you keep hugging me, we can't spar!

110
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,722
Get away from me!

111
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,141
You idiot!

112
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,979
-Thank you very much.
-Oh, sure.

113
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,608
At any rate, Kobashi,

114
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,694
can't you throw more powerful punches?

115
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,905
With that punch, you'll never get a KO.

116
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,947
You're only clinching.

117
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,242
See? You do <i>this</i> to
support it with your hip...

118
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,746
-Hey, what is it?
-Uh... nothing.

119
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,749
The motion is too big. It's easy to dodge.

120
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,084
-What did you say?
-Um, nothing.

121
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,211
Kobashi!

122
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:27,006
Kobashi, come over here.
Let's do some mitt-punching.

123
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,257
Yes, sir!

124
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,261
Hey, Kobashi! Don't get too serious!

125
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,223
Yasuda-san is old.
You don't want to break his bones!

126
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,975
Don't worry. That's not
going to happen with <i>his</i> punches.

127
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,978
Well, I guess you're right.
They are a good match for each other.

128
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,941
Don't let them get to you.
Now, give it a try.

129
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,108
Yes, sir.

130
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:56,077
Listen, Kobashi, powerful punches
are one's natural talent.

131
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,038
You can train to some extent,

132
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:03,209
but only the ones with natural talent
can excel beyond that.

133
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,337
Unfortunately you are not one of them.

134
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,009
Here... this side.

135
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:19,183
Long ago, there was an American
boxer by the name of Maxie Rosenbloom.

136
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:23,521
If I remember correctly, he won 209 times,

137
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,857
but only 19 KO victories were recorded.

138
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,528
He won 209 times, but only 19 KOs?

139
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,154
His punches weren't powerful?

140
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,909
Well, back then,
there was no TV or anything like that.

141
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,787
Since I've never seen him myself,
I'm not sure,

142
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,582
but at least it is a good indication
that powerful punches

143
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,625
are not everything in boxing.

144
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,671
Believe it or not,

145
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,925
he defended the light
heavyweight world title six times.

146
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,385
Six times?!

147
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,888
Certainly, a KO is
the grand finale in a boxing match,

148
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,684
but a KO is not everything in boxing.

149
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,146
What's wrong?

150
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,065
Uh... well, I'm happy.

151
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,653
Knowing that there's someone
who acknowledges the way I fight.

152
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,115
You don't need to worry
about how people perceive you.

153
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,868
It will change eventually
if you keep winning.

154
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,411
Yes!

155
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,166
Phew...

156
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,669
Are you all right?
Did I make you strain too much?

157
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,298
What are you talking about?
I can still manage.

158
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,134
By the way, why don't you come
with me to have soba?

159
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,594
Yes! Of course!

160
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,974
-Thank you for the meal!
-Sure!

161
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,313
When I was a boxer,

162
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,899
I used to go spy on
my opponents quite often.

163
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,900
What?

164
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,528
There was no such thing
as a VCR back then.

165
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,616
So, I would go there
and intensely study my opponent.

166
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,661
Whoa.

167
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,413
So, what do you think?
Do you think you can conquer Makunouchi?

168
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,917
Conquer?

169
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,961
Honestly speaking, it'll be hard.

170
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,965
His strong punches swing so fast

171
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,927
that they will easily break
through my guard.

172
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:23,140
Indeed, there aren't very many guys
with that level of punches.

173
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,145
Oh?

174
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,902
I don't know what to do.

175
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:38,531
When I think of Makunouchi,
this has been happening lately.

176
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,994
But I do believe there is a way.

177
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,955
He is still an imperfect boxer.

178
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,998
Even I can find many shortcomings.

179
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,959
Is that so?

180
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,381
Knowing your opponent and knowing yourself

181
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,216
are important principles of war.

182
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,636
And you know yourself very well.

183
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,351
This is just my hunch,
but in the upcoming match,

184
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,062
the outcome may just surprise everyone.

185
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,358
I'll do my best.

186
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:22,241
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

187
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,246
{\an8}KORAKUEN HALL

188
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,002
<i>Wow, what a long line.</i>

189
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,963
<i>If I lose first,</i>

190
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,632
<i>it will dampen
the victorious atmosphere for him.</i>

191
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,758
<i>I have to do my best!</i>

192
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,760
ROOM D

193
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,482
Yasuda-san, the third match is over.

194
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,816
Please get Kobashi ready.

195
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,860
Sure. Koba...

196
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,414
They're not making
chattering sounds today.

197
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,833
Well, I'm just taking
a "so-what" attitude.

198
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,589
-Then shall we go see the outcome?
-Yes!

199
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,591
ROOM B

200
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,679
You seem to be moving sharply.

201
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,933
Right. It's not bad at all.

202
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,434
I'm ready to get in the ring.

203
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,810
So he says.

204
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,355
It's unusual for him to say
something with such confidence.

205
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,441
He must be in super great condition.

206
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,695
Makunouchi for the 5th match,
please get ready.

207
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,697
-All right. Let's go, kid.
-Yes, sir!

208
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,913
{\an8}I'll be watching on the monitor
in my green room.

209
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,582
{\an8}To celebrate my victory in advance,
show me a flashy KO!

210
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,085
Yes! Takamura-san, good luck to you too.

211
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,046
Mind your own business! Hurry up and go!

212
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,007
Oh-yeah!

213
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,802
All right!

214
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:16,063
Watch out for head-butting and low blows,
and fight fair and square with each other.

215
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,942
Boxing is not predictable.

216
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,945
<i>I shouldn't get distracted!</i>

217
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,905
<i>All I need to do is play my own boxing!</i>

218
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,075
<i>Now I see him at close-range,
I can see he is well-built.</i>

219
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,743
<i>He must have real destructive power.</i>

220
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,662
<i>No, don't chicken out.</i>

221
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,541
<i>Calmly... I should fight the match calmly.</i>

222
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,543
Now, go back to your own corner.

223
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,379
Listen, your opponent is a passive boxer.

224
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,506
The match won't start if you keep staring.

225
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,008
Be aggressive from the get-go!

226
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,926
-Pull him in to exchange punches!
-Yes!

227
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,683
Seconds out!

228
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,071
<i>What is that?</i>

229
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,533
<i>I've never seen such a pose.</i>

230
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,624
<i>What shall I do?</i>

231
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,751
<i>I wonder what kind of attack is coming?</i>

232
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,923
Hey, don't let him mislead you, kid!
Go forward and punch!

233
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,759
<i>That's right! There is
no use contemplating.</i>

234
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,676
<i>I'll go forward!</i>

235
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,094
<i>Coming!</i>

236
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,558
Whoa! Awesome!

237
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,894
The other guy put up his guard,
but he lurched!

238
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,103
What a guy!

239
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,897
All right! He's in tip-top shape!

240
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,607
Keep showering him with punches!

241
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,609
<i>I'm going all the way without stopping!</i>

242
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,864
<i>Incredible. The power of
his punches and dash and dart</i>

243
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,408
<i>is far beyond what I imagined!</i>

244
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,246
Kobashi... Calmly...

245
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,749
<i>Ugh. My arms are feeling numb.</i>

246
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,751
<i>I can't fend off
his punches with my guard.</i>

247
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,255
<i>But now I have a good grasp
of the speed of his punches.</i>

248
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,258
Good! He dove in!

249
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,137
Ouch!

250
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,097
Good!

251
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,890
<i>Damn!</i>

252
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,854
Damn!

253
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,148
Ippo, don't strain too much!

254
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,567
Your swings are getting too big!
Swing small! Small!

255
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,031
<i>That left hand is tricky.</i>

256
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,245
<i>I need to step in deeper
before his left hand comes over me!</i>

257
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,166
<i>Just ignore it and step in!</i>

258
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,168
<i>I'm in!</i>

259
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,631
That's good!

260
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,134
-Oh, man!
-It was getting exciting!

261
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,385
It's a clinch!

262
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,304
Otherwise, Ippo's uppercut
would have connected for sure.

263
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,809
Break up! Step back!

264
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,526
Ah! You idiot! What were you
day-dreaming about?

265
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,195
Right after separating from
the clinch is a dangerous time!

266
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,120
Damn! He is connecting so well.

267
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,414
Those are not jabs.
They're like swing punches.

268
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,875
I wonder if Ippo's
having a hard time dodging them.

269
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,919
<i>Something... something is wrong.
I'm in good shape, though.</i>

270
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,672
<i>If I could connect only once... just once</i>...

271
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,592
<i>What a powerful attack!</i>

272
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,510
<i>When a barrage starts,
it's hard to stop it!</i>

273
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,308
It's not good!

274
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,060
<i>I've cornered him!</i>

275
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,439
Very good.

276
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,034
Break it up! Step back!

277
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,204
ROUND 1 REMAINING TIME

278
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,663
Oh, come on! Break it up!

279
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,374
Kobashi, break it up! Step back!

280
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,753
We're not here to see you guys hug!

281
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,296
Trade punches!

282
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,601
I've got booing going.

283
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,146
But if I trade punches with him head-on,

284
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,690
I'll be gone in a flash.

285
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,403
His every punch is incredible

286
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,572
but the power of
his entire body is just amazing.

287
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,826
That was fine.
Don't pay attention to booing.

288
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,329
You boxed according to <i>your</i> image
and <i>you</i> controlled the first round.

289
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,792
Makunouchi has completely lost sight
of his own rhythm.

290
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,920
Yes. But I have a long way to go.

291
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,088
So I can't slack off.

292
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,174
<i>Indeed, he cannot afford to slack off</i>

293
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,845
<i>because he is producing
such incredible punches continuously.</i>

294
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,430
<i>This kid must be
under tremendous pressure</i>...

295
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,099
<i>He's doing a great job.</i>

296
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,394
<i>Hang in there, Kobashi! Hang in there!</i>

297
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,857
You idiot! You allowed him to
disrupt your rhythm completely!

298
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,899
Your swing was wide.

299
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,943
No hit would ever connect like that.

300
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,862
My body feels great,

301
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,781
but something was awkward.

302
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,909
With a clinch and stuff,
I was evaded at a crucial moment.

303
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,120
And I found myself swinging very wide.

304
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,623
Right. He seems to be good
at evading during crucial moments.

305
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,041
He took the time to spy on you.

306
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,877
He did a good job analyzing your moves!

307
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,962
But, his analysis
is coming before his boxing

308
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,381
and his style is ever more passive.

309
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,050
It proves that he's afraid of
your powerful punches.

310
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,678
Don't do the wide swings,
but be aggressive again.

311
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,847
Keep putting pressure on him!

312
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,392
When he can't take it anymore,
there'll be an unguarded moment!

313
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,269
Seize that moment!

314
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,107
ROUND 2 REMAINING TIME

315
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,317
Seconds out.

316
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,485
Don't forget, don't lower your guard!

317
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,820
Yes!

318
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,451
How is he? Quite a few punches
landed on him...

319
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,703
Kobashi doesn't have
single-punch knockout power.

320
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,080
They didn't cause much damage
to Ippo at all.

321
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,166
That's why we should be concerned.

322
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,002
If the opponent's punches are mediocre,

323
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,672
Ippo may lose sight of
the importance of a tight guard.

324
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,843
Right. If he could just capture him
and drag him into an exchange of punches...

325
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,433
<i>Could we be falling into his trap?</i>

326
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,936
<i>I need to be aggressive
and gain the initiative!</i>

327
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,858
What?

328
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,568
Kobashi took the initiative!

329
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,527
<i>This is not good!</i>

330
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,404
<i>Very good, Kobashi!</i>

331
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,995
Hey, kid! I told you not to swing wide!

332
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,626
This is not good! He can't hear me at all.

333
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:56,046
Kobashi's preemptive attack crushed
Ippo's chance to recover his confidence!

334
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,089
Damn it!

335
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:01,802
Just connect once somehow!
Then you'll get hold of your own pace!

336
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,805
Well, it might be hard
to connect even once.

337
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:09,017
Though very awkward, Kobashi is sticking
to the textbook-perfect "Hit-and-Away."

338
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,979
Even we are intimidated by
Ippo's powerful punches from time to time.

339
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,856
Kobashi is amazingly calm.

340
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,442
Unlike what we thought,
he could pose danger.

341
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,784
Whoa! Ippo forced himself in!

342
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,287
<i>To the corner!
I should force him to the corner!</i>

343
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,289
<i>Then he won't be able to use his footwork!</i>

344
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,750
<i>Hang in there, Kobashi.</i>

345
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,920
Ippo led him to the corner by force!

346
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,255
Good! Don't let him get away!

347
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,757
<i>I won't let him get away!
I'll nail him this time!</i>

348
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,011
Good! Don't give up!

349
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,013
<i>Kobashi, hang in there.</i>

350
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,564
Man! A clinch again?!

351
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,068
Break it up! Step back!

352
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,654
Don't let him rest, kid!

353
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,948
Go all the way at once!

354
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,074
Huh?

355
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,539
-Chief...
-This isn't good, Yagi-chan.

356
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,589
<i>This isn't good at all.</i>

357
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,914
<i>Knockout.</i>

358
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,332
<i>A spirited and powerful punch</i>

359
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,919
<i>shatters the obsession for victory
of a boxer who trained long and hard</i>

360
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,921
<i>and it sinks him deeply into the floor.</i>

361
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,215
<i>It is spectacular. And in boxing,</i>

362
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,592
<i>it is the most clear-cut form of finality.</i>

363
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,554
<i>That's all the more reason
why it is difficult to aim for it.</i>

364
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,930
<i>But I have to aim for it.</i>

365
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,057
<i>No matter how painful it is,</i>

366
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,351
<i>I have no other choice
but to keep punching</i>

367
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,103
<i>to capture him and knock him down.</i>

368
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,522
<i>Next time, "Dream of a KO."</i>
