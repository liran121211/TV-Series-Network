NAKADAI BOXING GYM

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,375
<i>Got you!</i>

5
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:28,875
<i>It's the corkscrew!</i>

6
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,125
<i>I got hit!</i>

7
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,166
<i>His left follow-up is coming!
I have to raise my guard!</i>

8
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,125
<i>I must raise my guard!</i>

9
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,625
<i>What am I doing? I have to raise my guard!</i>

10
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,500
<i>What? What happened?</i>

11
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:59,875
A THING TO STRIVE FOR

12
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,666
Sempai!

13
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,375
That was intense! Date-san scored
a knockdown in a sparring match.

14
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,375
Yeah, but wasn't something weird
about Makunouchi's movement just now?

15
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,958
Did Date-san do something to him?

16
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,708
That was flawless, Date.
The experiment is a success.

17
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,375
Yeah, although there's room
for improvement.

18
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,833
Anyway, it was adequate for a trial run.

19
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:29,875
I feel a little sorry for
Makunouchi having to act as a guinea pig.

20
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,375
Whoa! He got up!

21
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,125
Ten seconds haven't gone by yet, right?

22
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,875
Sempai!

23
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,375
<i>That was an amazing left.</i>

24
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,625
<i>If not for the headgear, I wouldn't be up.</i>

25
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,583
<i>But the thing is,
I knew a left was coming.</i>

26
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,833
<i>For all that</i>...

27
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,000
<i>it was like time had stopped for me alone.</i>

28
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,958
<i>No, I need to think calmly.</i>

29
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,625
<i>Time-stopping punch doesn't exist!</i>

30
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,583
<i>I must have been paralyzed
as a reaction to something.</i>

31
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,666
<i>What on earth did Date-san do to me?!</i>

32
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,625
I'm ready. Please continue!

33
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,500
But still, Makunouchi-kun...

34
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:23,250
I need to burn more calories.
That would be a great help.

35
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,916
Hey, Date!

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,666
<i>This is a rare encounter
with the champion!</i>

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,166
<i>It would be wasteful to
let it end like this!</i>

38
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:32,666
Go ahead.

39
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,916
<i>This isn't about winning or losing.
I came here to learn!</i>

40
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,125
He still has plenty of pep!

41
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,458
<i>I'm being led into a corner again!</i>

42
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,541
<i>The corkscrew!</i>

43
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,958
<i>This is the punch!
I remember it up to this point!</i>

44
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,208
<i>Where did he hit me last time?!</i>

45
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,458
<i>This trajectory... His target
isn't my face, it's my body!</i>

46
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,458
<i>I contained it!</i>

47
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,958
<i>I'm wrong! It isn't my body!
Date-san is aiming at my...</i>

48
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,958
<i>heart!</i>

49
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:29,958
<i>I can't move!</i>

50
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,291
<i>I never knew.</i>

51
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,333
<i>When you get punched in the heart...</i>

52
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,208
<i>it totally paralyzes you!</i>

53
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,166
Sempai!

54
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,708
That's Date-san for you.

55
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,708
Amazing.

56
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,208
Heartbreak shot!

57
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,250
I've heard of this.

58
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,166
If a strong blow nails the heart bang-on...

59
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,208
you can momentarily
paralyze your opponent.

60
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,125
It stops your heart, even for a second?

61
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,958
What a dangerous punch!

62
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:08,833
<i>It's one of the most difficult of
all the pinpoint blows.</i>

63
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,625
<i>If the speed, intensity,
and angle of the punch are not aligned,</i>

64
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,833
<i>it's impossible to produce
this phenomenon.</i>

65
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,708
<i>This technique is only possible
through Date's control and corkscrew!</i>

66
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,666
<i>I've started to grasp the gist of it.
Now all I need to do is</i>...

67
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,708
Sempai!

68
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,208
Are you all right?!

69
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:30,708
Did you see that, Yamada-kun?
That's an amazing punch.

70
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,541
<i>I never imagined you could pinpoint
the heart with a corkscrew</i>

71
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,541
<i>to paralyze your opponent.</i>

72
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,708
<i>What an incredible guy!</i>

73
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,208
The deal was for three rounds, wasn't it?

74
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,708
Please proceed!

{\an8}‪NAKADAI BOXING GYM

76
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,791
The bell rang.

77
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,708
Thank you for the fight.

78
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:14,458
I really learned a lot today.
Please call me again any time!

79
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,041
Well, I'll be going now!

80
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,208
What was that all about?

81
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,750
He got knocked down six times,
but he left like there's nothing wrong.

82
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,875
When he first got here,
he was cowering with his buddy.

83
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,833
He learned that he was too inexperienced.

84
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:37,125
After all, not even one
of his punches hit home.

85
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,708
And what about you, Date-san?

86
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,208
You pulled out a punch
that you wouldn't even show us.

87
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,500
You took that "hammer the nail
that sticks up" proverb a little too far?

88
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,708
Listen.

89
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,750
At Shigeyo Nagashima's
professional debut match,

90
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,791
you know what Kaneda commented

91
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,208
when he struck out
all four at bat, don't you?

92
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,458
But maybe I'm over-praising him
by comparing him to Nakashima?

93
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,958
I was wondering
where you were going with that.

94
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,708
SHOWER ROOM

95
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:18,875
<i>Damn. I can't lift my arm to wash my head.</i>

96
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:24,208
<i>Still, he made some great swings.</i>

97
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:28,208
<i>Ippo Makunouchi...
Japan featherweight class ranked tenth.</i>

98
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,250
Tenth, huh?

99
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,333
Six knockdowns in three rounds.

100
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,083
If that had been a real match,
I would have lost by KO.

101
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,916
The champ really is strong.

102
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,333
I was overconfident
after taking Rookie of the Year.

103
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,041
I really learned a lot. Yeah.

104
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,333
Uh, Sempai!

105
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,791
I knew something felt prickly.

106
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,000
I must have really cut up
the inside of my mouth.

107
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,625
Are you all right?

108
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,125
Don't worry, I'm totally used to this.

109
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,291
Sempai, you really are amazing.

110
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,208
‪Huh?

111
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,291
Sempai...

112
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:19,041
I'm an easy target for bullies.

113
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:25,791
My family moves a lot
and I'm always switching schools.

114
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,791
Besides, I'm the way I am,

115
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,958
so everywhere I go,
I'm always everyone's errand boy.

116
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,333
When I saw you fight on TV
for the very first time,

117
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,000
I was terribly impressed.
No matter how many times you fell down,

118
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,791
you would keep getting
back up to fight back really strong.

119
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,041
Nah.

120
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,958
I knew...

121
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,833
I wanted to be just like the guy on TV!

122
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,458
I wanted to be strong like you!

123
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:59,541
But after seeing Aoki-san
and the others fight at that match,

124
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:03,958
and watching you fight today,
I couldn't get over my fear.

125
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:08,958
I couldn't help thinking
I could never be like you.

126
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,166
You're so strong that

127
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,541
you probably have no idea
where I'm coming from.

128
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,208
Has anyone ever told you
you smell like a worm?

129
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,250
Every day, they told him
he smelled like earthworms,

130
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,916
and kicked him once.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,208
When he insisted it was lugworms,
they slapped him three times.

132
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,208
They bullied him for 11 years,

133
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,416
from elementary school all the way
to his second year of high school.

134
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,875
Eleven years?!

135
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,500
Do you really know someone that miserable?

136
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,833
But it stopped in
the second year of high school?

137
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,000
Do you mean that something changed then?

138
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,250
He was able to do something
he wanted and devoted himself to it.

139
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,708
And that was the end of the bullying.

140
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,500
He stopped focusing on other things.

141
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,125
Before he knew it,
the things around him had changed.

142
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,625
Do you mean he stopped being bullied?

143
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,500
Yeah.

144
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,000
What on earth did he devote himself to?!

145
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:12,708
Boxing.

146
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,625
Do you mean the guy you're talking about...

147
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,708
Yeah, although I really
don't like remembering it.

148
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,875
That's ridiculous!

149
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,875
You? Ippo Makunouchi,

150
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,875
with the punches of dynamite,
was called a worm?!

151
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,875
Takamura-san knows all about it.

152
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,791
It was nice of you to say you were my fan,

153
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,375
but you change your mind now, huh?

154
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,750
I'm impressed! I never knew!

155
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,416
I thought that you had guts and muscles
from the very beginning.

156
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,458
Please keep fighting.
I'll cheer you now and forever!

157
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,375
Thanks.

158
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,875
You're the hope of
every bullied kid across Japan!

159
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,500
Great.

160
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,125
<i>I don't know whether to be happy or sad.</i>

161
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,875
Well, I have to be going now!

162
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,625
-Uh, Yamada-kun?
-Yes?

163
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,625
Let's both keep fighting.

164
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,083
Right!

165
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,166
<i>I wonder if I sounded anything
like a role model?</i>

166
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,875
<i>Yamada-kun complimented me on my strength,</i>

167
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,875
<i>but I still don't fully understand
what true strength is.</i>

168
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,666
<i>Date-san probably knows.</i>

169
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,041
<i>There's still a world
of difference between us,</i>

170
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,125
<i>but the next time... the next time we fight...</i>

171
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,250
<i>I'll be more!</i>

172
00:11:54,625 --> 00:12:00,541
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

173
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,291
Hello!

174
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,375
Hey.

175
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,291
You had a tough time yesterday, huh?

176
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,833
Oh, did Yamada-kun tell you about it?

177
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,541
-No, Takamura-san did.
-What?

178
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:13,125
He says you got knocked down
ten times in one round.

179
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,541
You fainted and he had to carry you
all the way home?

180
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,541
I already got the full deal from Takamura.

181
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,750
I never thought you'd be a match
for him, but...

182
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,291
It was a good learning experience.

183
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,541
Yes, sir.

184
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,291
It was a good learning experience, but...

185
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,958
What?

186
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,708
My punches are dynamite!

187
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,500
<i>Ippo got here sooner than I planned.</i>

188
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,458
<i>I was going to grab him first
and make him go along with my story.</i>

189
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,708
<i>I hope he hasn't spilled
what happened yesterday.</i>

190
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,625
Yo!

191
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,166
Oh, Takamura-san.

192
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,625
You had a lot of trouble
escorting Ippo yesterday, huh?

193
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,541
<i>He hasn't spilled the beans.</i>

194
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,625
<i>So, he's finally learned to play along.</i>

195
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,291
Well, the little guy gave it
his best, sure,

196
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,875
but look who he was up against.

197
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,083
What was that for all of a sudden,
you old man?!

198
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,625
So, did you keep your date?

199
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,916
You ratted me out!

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,916
KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

201
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,083
Be quiet! Step into my office!

202
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,875
You'll pay for this, Ippo!

203
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,583
Come back here!

204
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,541
He must've gotten dumped.

205
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,875
He wouldn't lie otherwise.

206
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,208
Oh! That reminds me.

207
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,708
-Did you see this, Ippo?
-What?

208
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,666
WILL THE JAPAN FEATHERWEIGHT CHAMPION
DATE RETURN THE TITLE WITHIN THE YEAR?

209
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,958
Return the title?

210
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,375
{\an8}Does that mean that
Date-san won't be champion anymore?!

211
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,166
{\an8}If he defends his title a few more times,

212
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,041
{\an8}he'll fight as a world ranker.

213
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,416
{\an8}So, he'll take the fast track
to world ranking,

214
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,958
{\an8}and then take on the world.

215
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,041
You lucked out.

216
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,666
If you rise in the ranks without a hitch,
he'll be leaving.

217
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,000
It'll make the belt easy pickings.

218
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,458
It can't be like that!

219
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,250
I can't fight Date-san?

220
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,708
But I have to!

221
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,458
What do you mean?

222
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,000
He just put you in your place yesterday.

223
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,291
It has nothing to do
with winning or losing!

224
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,208
It's not that.

225
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,625
I hear what you're saying, but...

226
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,791
You need a higher ranking
to do anything about it.

227
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,958
<i>This can't be.</i>

228
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,541
<i>I thought I had a new goal to strive for.</i>

229
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,708
Oh? Where's the chief?

230
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,458
He went out to chase down Takamura-san.

231
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,791
What?

232
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,291
That young shit.

233
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,000
He's horrifically fast on his feet
when he wants to be.

234
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,208
Chief!

235
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,875
We just got a phone call from Nakadai-san.

236
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,833
What? Does he want
another sparring session?

237
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,833
No, it's a request for Ippo-kun to fight.

238
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,791
Who's his opponent?

239
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,208
Fifth in featherweight, Keigo Okita.

240
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,708
<i>I know who that is.</i>

241
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,458
<i>It's the guy who was standing
next to Date-san yesterday.</i>

242
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,666
<i>Last year's All-Japan Rookie of the Year.</i>

243
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,583
<i>Fifth in featherweight?
If I win, I'll become...</i>

244
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,625
What should we do?

245
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,083
Chief!

246
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,041
Please accept it!
I would like to fight that match!

247
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:14,041
But he's a powerful enemy,
and there's hardly any time to prepare.

248
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:14,958
Time?

249
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,333
Okita-kun's opponent for
the semi-final is blank, do you see?

250
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:22,000
{\an8}Filipino boxer suddenly couldn't
make the trip.

251
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:25,375
In other words,
this match is in one month.

252
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,708
That's rather sudden.

253
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,958
Wouldn't it be hard
to fine-tune for it in time?

254
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,750
Huh?

255
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,000
What?

256
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,000
Kid, what's your current weight?

257
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,708
126,1 pounds.

258
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,833
All right. Yagi-chan,
we're going to accept that challenge.

259
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,958
Should we be making
that decision so easily?

260
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,708
Someone with a higher rank nominated him.

261
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,166
It doesn't get juicier than this.

262
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,750
It's settled! Stop standing around
and do roadwork!

263
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,416
Yes, sir!

264
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,625
What are you doing?! That means you too!

265
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,875
Yes, sir!

266
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:17,000
Don't you think it's unreasonable
to get him into condition in one month?

267
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,375
Don't worry. The kid ran his legs off

268
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,333
for the three months
he couldn't use his fist.

269
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,000
He's always kept fully prepared
to climb into the ring.

270
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:29,125
But Okita is a powerful boxer.
If he loses...

271
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,666
In his case, he's built to lose more
momentum losing a goal

272
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,000
than he would if he lost a match.

273
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,583
<i>The look in his eyes has changed vastly
since he sparred with Date.</i>

274
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,500
<i>His willingness to take the Okita fight</i>

275
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,500
<i>is probably his way of
furthering his challenge towards Date.</i>

276
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,875
<i>It's a path he was bound
to tread sooner or later.</i>

277
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,250
<i>The kid has already taken his first steps</i>

278
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,541
<i>towards the highly-contested
featherweight front line.</i>

279
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,250
NAKADAI BOXING GYM

280
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,250
Hey, Okita!

281
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes, sir?

282
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,208
We just got an answer from Kamogawa-san.

283
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,666
He says they accept.

284
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,416
I see.

285
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,375
Date-san.

286
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,458
What's wrong? Keep going.

287
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:15,916
Right.

288
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,416
How's that?

289
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,916
Good rotation. It's hard
to get near you through that.

290
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,166
However, that won't stop Makunouchi.

291
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,166
Why did you nominate him?

292
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:41,083
After watching that sparring session,
I felt like challenging him myself.

293
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,916
I know you're not a stupid boxer who
can't tell there's more to him than that.

294
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,958
I did it because
I watched you spar with him.

295
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,916
I don't want to say any more.

296
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,666
All right. I won't ask.

297
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,375
Here.

298
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,416
I won't run from his power.

299
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,916
However, there's a definite gap.

300
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,916
How do you think this
would fare against him?

301
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,750
I will win. Count on it.

302
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,166
{\an8}KOURAKUEN HALL

303
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,250
Today's Featherweight class
semi-final of ten rounds

304
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,166
is about to begin!

305
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,833
Still, do you think
he perfected himself in just a month?

306
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,708
He was in good condition
when he sparred with us.

307
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,166
No, that's not where the problem lies.

308
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,041
If he wins this,
Ippo will be able to line up with us.

309
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,750
Aoki, you're in 5th place,
and Kimura, you're in 4th.

310
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,083
Oh, well. I can't be expected
to understand

311
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,208
how it feels to be overtaken
by one's junior.

312
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,875
<i>He always goes for the guts.</i>

313
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,791
Go, Ippo!

314
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,916
Fifth rank is nothing!
Take down that lousy fifth ranker!

315
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,791
What?

316
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,125
Listen, don't get distracted
by his boxing career.

317
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,000
He's sure to use subtle techniques.

318
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,583
Attack him at your own rhythm.

319
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:20,541
Yes, sir!

320
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,125
<i>I can't lose this.</i>

321
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,833
<i>If I don't hurry,
I won't be able to fight Date-san!</i>

322
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,333
<i>I can't take the long way around.</i>

323
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,791
Champion... how's Okita-kun doing?

324
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,458
He's a boxer with good sense.

325
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,083
He's completely duplicated
your boxing style.

326
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,500
And his strong point is
that he will fully utilize his knowledge.

327
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,291
Although that's something
you can't do with power alone anyway.

328
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,291
Don't underestimate Okita.

329
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,625
I'm sure this will be
an interesting match.

330
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,041
Seconds out!

331
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,041
<i>In that sparring session,</i>

332
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,875
<i>why did you use a punch you kept secret</i>

333
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,166
<i>on a guy from another gym?</i>

334
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,666
<i>Did you find him more useful than me,</i>

335
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,166
<i>even though I'm in the same gym as you?</i>

336
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,625
<i>I joined Nakadai gym
because I looked up to you</i>

337
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,958
<i>and caught up to you,
all the way to 5th ranking!</i>

338
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:27,083
<i>It's no joke that I'm useless to you now!</i>

339
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,166
<i>I'll never accept that!</i>

340
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,791
<i>Never!</i>

341
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,791
<i>If I beat this guy, I'll be ranked fifth!</i>

342
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,166
<i>I have to win and challenge Date-san!</i>

343
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,916
Oops! They begin the jabs
without waiting for the referee's signal!

344
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,500
The two fighters are
already making fireworks!

345
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,250
<i>To start, I need to control the pace!</i>

346
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,250
<i>I can't let him get control of the pace!</i>

347
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,583
It's a battle for control!

348
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,625
So the first attack is key!

349
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:04,125
He's using straight infighting
on Makunouchi.

350
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,875
<i>I got a body blow!</i>

351
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,375
<i>I can't let him hit me!</i>

352
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,375
<i>He's fast.</i>

353
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,125
<i>I'll hold him and strike from above!</i>

354
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,625
<i>I stopped him!</i>

355
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,625
<i>What?!</i>

356
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,958
<i>Now!</i>

357
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,166
<i>Right!</i>

358
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,916
There it is!

359
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,916
Makunouchi's power blow
that sends them flying, guard and all!

360
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,916
All right!

361
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,166
We have control of the pace!
Whale into him!

362
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,916
<i>His punches aren't as powerful
as Sendo-san's!</i>

363
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,166
<i>I'll go forward prepared
to take a few hits!</i>

364
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,416
<i>Don't pull back.</i>

365
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,166
Oh, my! This time Makunouchi's guard
is blown away!

366
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,833
Okita hammers an intense right straight!

367
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,041
<i>This punch!</i>

368
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,708
<i>It's a corkscrew! Just like Date-san's!</i>

369
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,000

370
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:27,291
<i>Ranking. Something that was originally
set to act as an order of priority</i>

371
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:30,083
<i>of challenge rights towards the champion.</i>

372
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,750
<i>At present, lower ranked fighters
can become challengers</i>

373
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,083
<i>if the champ nominates them.</i>

374
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,125
<i>But it's true that
the possibility of a challenge grows</i>

375
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,125
<i>the higher your ranking is.</i>

376
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,625
<i>That's right. Fifth ranking
is much closer than 10th,</i>

377
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,625
<i>closer to the ring
where the champion awaits!</i>

378
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:49,250
<i>Next time, "Two Rookies of the Year."</i>
