{\an8}I'm home!

{\an8}Welcome home.

6
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,916
What are you going to do for dinner today?

7
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,208
I'll be late, so I don't need any.

8
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,750
Got to go. Bye!

9
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:49,583
Boxing... I wonder
what's so exciting about it.

00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,083
-Hmm, let's see.
-Hey, I'm over here.

12
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,125
You are early, aren't you?

13
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,916
Well, this is the first time I'll get
to see him since he became a pro,

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,625
so I didn't want to be late.

15
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:04,625
All right, then.

16
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,083
Why don't we go right in
and grab some empty seats?

17
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,208
Yes.

18
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,083
-Hey, that's Takamura.
-It sure is.

19
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,708
He looks big close up.

20
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,541
Should I ask him to shake hands with me?

21
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,583
<i>He is indeed Takamura-san. He is famous.</i>

22
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,458
Hey, look at that boy.

23
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,708
-Really?
-Yeah.

24
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,500

are nice enough to remember me!</i>

<i>The KO time for the match which just ended
was three rounds, one minute, 50 seconds.</i>

29
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,875
-It's next, isn't it?
-Yes, it's about to start at last.

30
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,833
Thank you.

31
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,333
<i>She's the girl on the bicycle!</i>

32
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,583
What are you doing?!

33
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,291
-Is she your type?
-No, not at all.

34
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't be so embarrassed.

35
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,416
I see. Ippo is a man after all.

36
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,708
I'm telling you, that's not it.

37
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,375
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

38
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,291
Is E-18 around here?

39
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,041
E-18?

40
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,125
Number 18 is right here.

41
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,916
You were using a little trick
to try and impress her.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,916
-What?
-You deny it.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,916
But you were actually taking
a thorough approach, weren't you?

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,750
That's not what it was!

45
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,833
<i>I wonder if my zipper has been open
like this for a long time.</i>

46
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,666
-Hey, look at that boy.
-Really?

47
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,583
<i>So they were talking about this?</i>

48
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,250
<i>She does smell good.</i>

49
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,958
How long are you going to
remain distracted? The match will start.

50
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,625
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,125
I've been waiting for you, genius!

52
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,500
I've been keeping my eyes on him
since his debut.

53
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,583
Give it your best!

54
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,541
Ah! Miyata-kun!

55
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,500
Make sure you don't get punched
in the face!

56
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,125
<i>It's impressive.</i>

57
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,625
<i>He already has this many fans.</i>

58
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,791
<i>I wonder if this girl
is a fan of his as well.</i>

59
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,666
In the red corner,

60
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,583
of Kawahara Gym, 125 and a half pounds...

61
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,666
Ichiro Miyata.

62
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,416
Ichiro!

63
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,125
Ichiro!

64
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,833
It's been a while since I saw him last.

65
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,125
The muscles around
his shoulders are different.

66
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,666
Yes, his entire body
has become one size larger.

67
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,833
In the blue corner,

68
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,666
of Maeda Gym, 125 pounds sharp.

69
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,041
Teruhiko Takada!

70
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,500
It'll get tricky for you
if he uses his legs.

71
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,916
-Stop his legs by hitting his stomach.
-All right.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,125
His boxing style is a bit rough.
Don't drop your guard.

73
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,416
Okay, Dad.

74
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,208
For your information,
this is a second-round match

75
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,166
in the Eastern Japan
Rookie Championship Tournament.

76
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,708
Takada is a fighting boxer just like you.

77
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,458
Yes. Chief told me to watch him carefully.

78
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,375
Well, he'll be lucky
if his punch connects even once.

79
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,375
What? His feet aren't moving!

80
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,000
<i>He's taking me lightly.</i>

81
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,625
<i>So he thinks he doesn't
need to use his feet against me!</i>

82
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,000
<i>Damn you!</i>

83
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,000
He's throwing his shoulder at him!

84
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,125
<i>How about this?! Since we're
this close, you can't dodge me.</i>

85
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,875
-What?!
-Exchange punches deliberately?

86
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,125
<i>Well, if that's what you want!</i>

87
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:38,750
<i>Why? Miyata could have dealt with
such punches easily with his footwork!</i>

88
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,250
Damn!

89
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:48,500
What's going on? This is
like a match between in-fighters.

90
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,291
He is out-hitting him.

91
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,958
Damn...

92
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,500
Damn!

93
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,583
<i>Miyata-kun.</i>

94
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,875
<i>He's leading him on?!</i>

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,166
What was that?

96
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,291
I didn't see anything.

97
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,166
This guy is indeed a genius!

98
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,666
He's on a different level!

99
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,416
<i>Counter! Besides, his speed</i>

100
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,166
<i>and destructive power
is much better than before!</i>

101
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,458
Good job.

102
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,916
Not at all. I got hit
with a few good ones.

103
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,375
That could be a fatal mistake
against some opponents.

104
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,375
Looks like it's not just
his body which has gotten tougher.

105
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,958
But why did he try
the game of hitting-each-other?

106
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,333
I guess he was afraid of making
some foolish boxer

107
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:15,291
feel overconfident if he couldn't knock
down an opponent of that level.

108
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,541
In addition to close-range
and rough fighting techniques

109
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,291
his counterpunches have become sharper.

110
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,208
He has fewer shortcomings.

111
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,375
<i>That could happen to me...
the way he is now.</i>

112
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,291
Why...

113
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,791
I wonder why he wants
to do such a thing as boxing?

114
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:40,791
<i>Huh?</i>

115
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:46,583
<i>Miyata has won, though. Isn't she his fan?</i>

116
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,000
Miyata is doing a great job,
so you should...

117
00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:00,166
While I'm talking seriously to you,
what's your nose doing?

118
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,458
You're tearing it up! Tearing it up!

119
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,708
{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

120
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,416
It's hot!

121
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,750
Yagi-san! Let's buy an A/C!

122
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,916
You guys are both being lazy.

123
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,833
You both made it to the eight-round level.

124
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,583
Why don't you emulate
your junior's behavior?

125
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,750
My junior?

126
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,500
He is indeed tough, isn't he?

127
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,250
Have no choice,
I guess. Let's get started.

128
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,416
Hey, Ippo. We're going to spar!

129
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,708
Yes! Thank you!

130
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,750
Hey, your sides are wide open!

131
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,041
Hey, move your head
from side to side. Head!

132
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,458
-It's your turn.
-Here I come.

133
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
I'm ready!

134
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,458
Oh, they seem to be working hard.

135
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:52,625
Yes, Ippo is being a good stimulant
and we're getting fired up.

136
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,958
It's hot.

137
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,750
It's hot!

138
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,375
Can't you do anything about his match?

139
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:03,250
Uh, well...I've been negotiating
with many different venues, though.

140
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,000
Thank you so much!

141
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,208
-Sure.
-No problem.

142
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,958
Hey, you guys are working hard.

143
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,458
Oh, Fujii-san!

144
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,458
{\an8}MASHIBA

145
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,666
Oh, Mashiba won, too.

146
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,708
The opponent was covered with blood.
It was a horrific knockout.

147
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,500
Seeded fighters are winning as expected.

148
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,166
The third-seeded Yoshida
will win for sure.

149
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,125
Back when he was an amateur,
he had an impressive record.

150
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,250
But an upheaval took place.

151
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,375
An unheard-of boxer, Kobashi, won.

152
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,958
Do you want to watch?
He'll be your next opponent.

153
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:51,000
‪HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

154
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,000
{\an8}PLAY

155
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:59,625
<i>In the red corner,
126 pounds, of Ishin Gym...</i>

156
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,291
<i>Mitsuo Yoshida!</i>

157
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,625
Whoa. He looks strong.

158
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,625
Yoshida is not merely what he looks like.

159
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,958
Yoshida won second in the Interscholastic
Athletic Meet two years in a row.

160
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,000
So, that Kobashi guy who won
against him, he must be pretty tough.

161
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:20,833
<i>In the blue corner,
124 pounds and a half, of Ohtaki Gym...</i>

162
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:25,375
<i>Kenta Kobashi!</i>

163
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,833
Well, your appearance isn't necessarily
proportionate to your strength.

164
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:37,791
<i>He's good!</i>

165
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,291
Good! It's a chance!

166
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,625
Hey! Why are you clinching now?

167
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,458
Oh, his jab just connected,
but... not working.

168
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,125
Such punches won't connect.
Put your weight into it! More!

169
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,333
-Right on!
-That's it!

170
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,125
Huh? He can't be serious.

171
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,000
At any rate, his jab looks light.

172
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,000
Yoshida looks like
nothing's bothering him.

173
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,833
Clinching again?

174
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,000
Did he really win? Are you sure?

175
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,500
Repeating jab and clinch.
It's a monotonous game,

176
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,541
but I'm sure a climax is...

177
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,000
coming up, right?

178
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,000
<i>It's over...</i>

179
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,625
<i>with no climax at all.</i>

180
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,833
Hmm... so he won by points.

181
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,541
Hey, congratulations!

182
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,541
Good for you.
Your next match will be easy.

183
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,375
Don't say such a thing.

184
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,375
His rhythm was thrown off by
the opponent's jabs and clinches.

185
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:06,666
If you lose sight of
your own boxing style, you will lose.

186
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,791
But I suppose it's impressive not
to let the seeded boxer fight his way.

187
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,583
That's right, sure.

188
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,291
It was a waste of time.

189
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,000
What is it?!

190
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,166
What the heck?

191
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,083
What's that?! He's coming through,
pushing the girls aside!

192
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,583
You, who the heck are you?!

193
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,083
This is the match of another seeded boxer.

194
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,583
What?! Then he is
the fourth-seeded boxer, Hayami.

195
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,666
Hayami?

196
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,833
A robe for a four-round match?
Five million years too soon!

197
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,916
He looks as if he thinks he has
the right to be surrounded by girls.

198
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,708
This is the type of guy
I can't forgive at all!

199
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,958
Come on over to middleweight.
I'll treat you real good.

200
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,208
I can't see!

201
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,041
I'm... I'm sorry.

202
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,333
Tsk. How unlike me, I got carried away.

203
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,500
I can't forgive him after all.

204
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:13,875
Because of Hayami, Yoshida was
always number two throughout high school.

205
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:18,500
If the number two was like that, it's easy
to guess how pitiful number one is.

206
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,500
Wow. His opponent is
showing a pretty good fighting spirit.

207
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,750
Of course he is.

208
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,500
Stare him down, harder!

209
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,041
<i>Hayami-san!</i>

210
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:38,000
Damn! How much
more hateful is he going to get?

211
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,416
Right on! Beat up Hayami!

212
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,666
Punch right into his face!

213
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,666
He's fast!

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,666
What?!

215
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,291
Right here! Don't take
your eyes off of Hayami's arms.

216
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,666
His arms?

217
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,875
How many punches do you think he threw
in before the referee stopped him?

218
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,541
Twenty-seven punches.
With his fast barrage of punches,

219
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,666
Hayami conquered
the Interscholastic Tournament.

220
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,041
It's called "the shotgun."

221
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,666
The shotgun.

222
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,416
His sense of boxing is extraordinary.

223
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,625
Based on his given talent only,
Hayami might exceed Miyata.

224
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,125
Exceeding Miyata-kun?

225
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,833
In speed and reflexes,
he might be as good as Miyata.

226
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,166
No, in speed, he is beyond Miyata.

227
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,125
I'm going back to my practice.

228
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,083
Was it too much for him?

229
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,541
His goal is to fight
against Miyata in the final.

230
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,791
So it was a good stimulant
to boost his spirit.

231
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:23,791
But he's up against another big wall.

232
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,041
<i>The shotgun.</i>

233
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,583
Huh?

234
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,541
Now there is a bakery here.

235
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,958
Good evening!

236
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:57,041
<i>It's late, so they are all leftovers.</i>

237
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,458
Excuse me.

238
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:02,041
These are all freshly baked
and they are all tasty.

239
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,458
<i>She is that girl!</i>

240
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:18,458
<i>There's no way
she remembers somebody like me.</i>

241
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,458
The total is 450 yen.

242
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,458
Thank you!

243
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,250
Excuse me?

244
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,666
Uh... yes.

245
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,875
Aye-yi-yi.

246
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:36,958
Are you all right?

247
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:41,458
Uh... well... you don't have to help me...

248
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,833
Here you go. Is this all that you dropped?

249
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,250
Thanks.

250
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,416
You're welcome.

251
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,541
<i>I guess she doesn't remember me.</i>

252
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,333
<i>I only picked up her ticket.</i>

253
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,791
Excuse me.

254
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,250
Yes?!

255
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,500
-This is a free gift for you.
-Huh?

256
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:06,041
We are about to close
and I don't want to waste them.

257
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,458
If they are good, please come back.

258
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,416
Thank you so much.

259
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,041
<i>I wonder if she'll come
see a boxing match again.</i>

260
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:26,666
<i>She might happen to see my match.</i>

261
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,500
<i>Well, that'd be too good to be true.</i>

262
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:33,166
<i>No. That's possible.
They say good things come in threes.</i>

263
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,916
{\an8}-Yo.
-Yo.

264
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,416
{\an8}Gee. It's burning hot today again.

265
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,041
{\an8}Huh? Where is Ippo?

266
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,583
{\an8}He is out for roadwork.

267
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,166
{\an8}Oh, really?

268
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,333
-He's as fired up as usual.
-Yeah.

269
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,541
But don't you think it's a bit too much?

270
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,666
Ippo, too much of
a workout has an adverse effect.

271
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,041
Make sure you take breaks.

272
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:06,916
Yes.

273
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,333
Hey, something strange
is going on with him.

274
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,458
Yeah.

275
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,375
What's up? Is there something wrong?

276
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,583
Please take a look at him.

277
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,583
Ah! That nose!

278
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,041
What's going on?

279
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,583
When his nose is puffed up like that...

280
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,541
Then what?

281
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,250
He is getting excited about a woman!

282
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,750
What?!

283
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:35,833
No, that's not it!

284
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,958
I've been thinking
he has been unusually fired up.

285
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,833
That's what this is all about?!

286
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:44,458
Truly, that's not it! Please believe me!

287
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,250
I'm telling you the truth.

288
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,958
Well, if you insist.

289
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,666
If you indulge yourself in women,
you can't survive in this world.

290
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,250
That's exactly right.

291
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,541
Those who make an effort
when others are having fun

292
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,208
can laugh in the end.

293
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,375
Boxing is such a hungry sport.

294
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:08,708
Those who give themselves up for
women have their energy taken away and...

295
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,208
Are you guys jealous?

296
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:16,375
Oh, my, how ugly
it is for guys to be jealous.

297
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,375
Damn! That's right.
I want to be surrounded by girls too.

298
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,458
Wait and see! Someday,

299
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,541
I will have my own
women only cheering squad!

300
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,458
Oh, cute girls!

301
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:33,708
My fighting style will capture
young ladies' hearts nice and secure!

302
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,416
I'll create my own harem,

303
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,291
and it'll be exciting and naughty...

304
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,083
My heart and body are in heaven,

305
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,416
and with my ultimate technique,
we'll go all the way!

306
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,541
What on earth is going on with Aoki-san?

307
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:48,125
Don't worry too much.
But I'll give you one piece of advice.

308
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,041
Huh?

309
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,208
When it comes to women, you'd
better not take what Aoki says seriously.

310
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,666
Why is that?

311
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,583
AOKI

312
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,791
These are what he calls "the cute girls."

313
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:05,791
What? The cute... girls?

314
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:09,000
The guy's got some sort
of weird fetish for dogfaces.

315
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,791
Imagine getting that cheering squad.

316
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,000
{\an8}‪FISHING BOAT RENTAL MAKUNOUCHI

317
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,541
{\an8}I think he'll be back soon.

318
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,041
I'm home!

319
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,416
Oh, he's back.
A phone call from Takamura-kun.

320
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,541
Takamura-san?

321
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,250
-Hello...
<i>-Camp!</i>

322
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,958
<i>My title match has been decided!</i>

323
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,083
Really?

324
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,333
<i>We're going to have
a training camp for a week in Izu!</i>

325
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,125
<i>The old man can't come,
but Aoki and Kimura will.</i>

326
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,458
<i>You come too!</i>

327
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,208
What? This is such short notice.

328
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:41,041
<i>Don't make excuses!
Hurry up and pack your stuff!</i>

329
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,333
But I have to help my mother.

330
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,208
I'm coming! Please take me with you!

331
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,416
<i>All right!</i>

332
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,583
<i>This is going to be
a tough camp. Be prepared!</i>

333
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:00,333
<i>A training camp. All right!</i>

334
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,333
What? What are you doing?!

335
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,583
I told you not to blow up
my dear dolphin yet!

336
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,791
Well, I can hardly wait.

337
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,125
Takamura-san, is this
enough sun tan lotion?

338
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,041
Yeah, that'll be enough.

339
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,750
The beach without the old man.

340
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,125
It's going to be hard.

341
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:37,708
<i>Shift weight. In-fighter's
sharp footwork to follow the opponent.</i>

342
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,375
<i>Brilliant footwork of the out-fighters.</i>

343
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,666
<i>The source of sharp moves
which excite the audience.</i>

344
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,708
<i>These are all built up
through disciplined efforts.</i>

345
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,666
<i>My very first training camp.</i>

346
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,416
<i>No matter how hard it may be,
I will keep up for sure.</i>

347
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,000
<i>If I can't do that, I won't possibly
be able to win a match in the future.</i>
