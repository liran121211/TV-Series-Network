ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,608
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,471
The opponent for your debut match
has been selected.

4
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,143
Nishikawa Gym's Yusuke Oda!

5
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,354
What? Did you say Yusuke Oda?!

6
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,482
-Do you know him, Takamura-san?!
-Nope.

7
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,900
<i>What the heck?</i>

8
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,777
-Oda?
-Who's Oda?

9
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,739
I'd like to tell you the details...
but I don't know, either.

10
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,409
If you don't know,
don't build up the suspense, moron!

11
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,330
Yusuke Oda, 21 years old.
He has fought a total of five matches,

12
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,667
with three wins and two losses,
and all three were won by KO.

13
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,546
He scored every KO using
a right straight in the early rounds,

14
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,048
so you need to watch out
for his right punches.

15
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,093
My debut match.

16
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:21,683
DEBUT MATCH!

17
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:27,897
<i>Ippo! A debut match? You?!</i>

18
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,024
<i>Ow! That hurts, Aoki-san!</i>

19
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,610
<i>We heard that you're
going to be fighting against Oda.</i>

20
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,195
Do you know him?

21
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,865
Yeah. He's a boxer in junior light,
just like me.

22
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,700
He was still at the four-round level?

23
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:43,121
Junior light? That means
he's one level above me!

24
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,497
He can't get ahead there,

25
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,417
so he's coming down to
featherweight to take the top.

26
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,837
Anyway, considering his record
as a four-round boxer, he's no biggie.

27
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,714
You'll win easy.

28
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:57,093
<i>Don't tell me that!
You'll make me feel more pressured!</i>

29
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,263
<i>Still, he's already
fought five matches as a pro.</i>

30
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,348
<i>I have to stay sharp!</i>

31
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,396
<i>Oda!</i>

32
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,315
NISHIKAWA BOXING GYM

33
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,442
Where is that blasted Oda?!

34
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,112
If you want Oda, he went to do roadwork.

35
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,615
Really?! That's good to hear!

36
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,200
Although it's been nearly three hours.

37
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:26,080
That bastard! I bet he's loafing
around somewhere as usual!

38
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,083
And do you know who that policeman was?

39
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,086
It was Yuji!
Remember him from high school?

40
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,424
Can you believe that hooligan
is a policeman? Isn't that a hoot?!

41
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,800
So, I said to him...

42
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,303
Yusuke, shouldn't you
be heading back to the gym?

43
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,180
Huh? Why?

44
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,891
You have a match coming up, don't you?

45
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,142
Won't seeing me like this

46
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,436
when you should be training affect
your condition?

47
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,023
Why would my condition be affected
by something minor like this?

48
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,026
But you'll be fighting in
featherweight class this time, won't you?

49
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,444
What about your weight control?

50
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,530
I'll pass their silly weight
check by sweating a little.

51
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,199
Don't worry.

52
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,244
Or is it that you think
I'm going to lose or something?

53
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,497
Not at all! Still...

54
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,457
I'm telling you. I'll win for sure!

55
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,211
That's true. You'll win for sure.

56
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,587
No, duh.

57
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,716
Dad!

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,511
Oda, you bastard!
What are you doing in there?!

59
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,347
I'm coming in there right now,
so don't try to run!

60
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,601
Oh, man! Mikami-san is going to
ream me out inside the restaurant.

61
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,771
What about the roadwork
you were supposed to be doing?

62
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,815
The Chief was gracious enough

63
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,526
to give you a chance to start over
in the featherweight class,

64
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,945
but here you are,
dilly-dallying in a place like this!

65
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,322
Dad, please don't yell.

66
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,285
Reiko! I can't believe you, either!
Secretly meeting with this slob!

67
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,872
There's nothing secret about it.
I did my roadwork.

68
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,668
I just ran into Reiko down the street,
and we've only been here ten minutes.

69
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,878
You bastard. You have a lot of nerve.

70
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,883
Are you still upset about that last match?

71
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,803
I feel I should mention
that even though I lost the match,

72
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:07,307
I don't believe for
an instant that I lost the fight!

73
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,893
That coward bobbed
and weaved me out of points.

74
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,730
When it comes to exchanging blows,
I'm confident that I can win

75
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,357
with a smooth KO no matter
who my opponent is!

76
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,026
With my right hand!

77
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,153
Is that all you have
to say for self-promotion?

78
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:25,158
Win with a smooth KO?!
The reason you lost is obvious!

79
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,286
Stamina!

80
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,789
With your skill, he should
have been easy for you to beat,

81
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:36,044
but you got weak in the third round
because you didn't do enough running!

82
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,963
Do you understand
even a little bit of my frustration?!

83
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,632
You're not the only one who's frustrated.

84
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,178
If I had landed even a single punch
with my right, I would have won!

85
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,681
I was deceived by your right punch.

86
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,810
<i>When you won your debut match
with a single KO punch from your right,</i>

87
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,937
<i>I was honestly blown away.</i>

88
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,693
<i>It made me believe that both the Japan
and World titles were not a dream.</i>

89
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,322
But in reality, you got a swelled head
and turned into a dumb boxer

90
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,949
who just swings his arms
around like an ape!

91
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,537
You seem to believe
anything but a KO is a loss.

92
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,707
But you <i>will</i> experience humiliation
in your next match.

93
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:19,170
Give me a break. My opponent is
just a greenhorn on his debut match.

94
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,130
Besides, he's one below me.

95
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,758
Rumor has it that
he's the talk of the town with that

96
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,177
spectacular KO
at the pro certification exam.

97
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,889
I'm sure his punches will
overcome any differences in weight class.

98
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,307
This is a great chance.

99
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,394
Get him to smack you into shape,
along with your rotten spirit.

100
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,274
Also, if you lose this match,
it'll be your last!

101
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,195
The gym says they won't sponsor
any more matches for a bonehead like you!

102
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,697
I'm getting tired of it, too!
Oh, and one more thing.

103
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,952
I have no intention of leaving my girl
with an irresponsible bum like you!

104
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,914
If you don't show grit in the next match,
I'll make sure you never see her again!

105
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,124
Let's go!

107
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,134
That all you got?!

108
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,636
I can take more! Again, please!

109
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,980
Another!

110
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,609
Another!

111
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,155
Jeez, it's disgusting
how much he loves to train.

112
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,491
If it were me, I'd slack off the moment
I found out I was up against Oda.

113
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,080
I can take more!

114
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,502
Another!

115
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,910
What's wrong, Reiko?

116
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,411
Your noodles will get soggy.

117
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,079
Oh, yeah. That's true.

118
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,456
You worried about something?

119
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,166
No, it's nothing.

120
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,377
-Welcome!
-Hi there!

121
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,837
Hey, you're all here!

122
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,174
I'm treating him to noodles to
cheer him up before his debut match.

123
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,509
Give us a freebie, okay?

124
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,843
Yeah.

125
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,930
Like I'm telling you,
you don't have to be so worried.

126
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,931
What's up?

127
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,934
You know, the kid's such a worry wart.

128
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,562
Anyway, Oda's famous for being gutless.
You know, Yusuke Oda.

129
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,149
Maybe, but he's one rank above me.

130
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,818
I'm sure one of his punches
could really do damage.

131
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,489
A sporadic right punch won't connect
no matter how much he flails it around.

132
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:55,326
Either way, when the third round comes,
he'll run out of gas and plotz out.

133
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,327
Here you go!

134
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,163
I hear that he calls himself
a KO artist or something.

135
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,540
What a clown!

136
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,750
He only has three wins and two losses,

137
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,878
but he's bragging that
his right punch will take over the world!

138
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,839
It's pretty pathetic
when someone is that wrong, huh?!

139
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,383
Uh, but...

140
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,344
If you're that worried about it,
I'll tell your fortune.

141
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,223
Whoa, there he goes!

142
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,849
Uh, is he accurate?

143
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,227
Yeah. I don't know how he rigs it,

144
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,646
but he's never been wrong.

145
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,192
It's your lucky day!
This is the best card you can get!

146
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,653
Your fortune for the match is extra lucky!

147
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,738
What? Really?!

148
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,534
Huh? What?

149
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,868
What's so funny?

NISHIKAWA BOXING GYM

151
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,510
Hey, you waited for me.

152
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,347
Is your training already done for the day?

153
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,142
Everyone else still seems to be at it.

154
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,979
Oh, those guys are making
a futile effort to compensate

155
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,480
for their shortcomings.

156
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,900
A natural such as myself,
on the other hand...

157
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,115
What do you think you're doing, Reiko?

158
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,827
Are you really a bum like my father says?

159
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,747
Why, you!

160
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:30,546
You're always all mouth.
You're making me lose faith in you!

161
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,465
You're not making any sense!

162
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,967
Let's break up.

163
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,641
Actually, I've been considering it
for a while.

164
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,644
If you lose in the next match...

165
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,562
I decided that I'd break up with you.

166
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,650
I don't know if I can
believe in you anymore!

167
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,360
I've had it!

168
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,570
Dummy! I told you I'd win, remember?!

169
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,988
You'll see with my next match!

170
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,490
Your next match?!

171
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:04,372
Earlier, I happened to hear
your opponent's friends talking about you.

172
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,998
Do you know what they're saying?

173
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,504
They called you a clown! And pathetic!

174
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,506
What?!

175
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,468
Yusuke, what happened to you?

176
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,096
You didn't used to be this way.

177
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,599
<i>You used to be the last one
to return from practice,</i>

178
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:27,228
<i>and though you've
always had your flaky moments,</i>

179
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:32,108
<i>when you spoke about boxing,
you were so serious, it was scary.</i>

180
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,112
<i>That's the Yusuke I fell in love with.</i>

181
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,656
I want...

182
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,244
I want to see the Yusuke I used to know!

183
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,790
Uh, hey!

184
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,637
Get him to smack you into shape along
with your rotten spirit!

185
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,766
They called you a clown! And pathetic!

186
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,606
Goddamn them!

187
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,696
Why were you laughing so hard
when Aoki-san told my fortune?

188
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,157
It doesn't make sense,
because I got the best card.

189
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,287
It's true that Aoki's fortune telling
is 100% accurate,

190
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,750
but the result is always
the opposite of the card he draws!

191
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:43,304
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

192
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,097
You idiot! Don't step back!

193
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:49,268
Step forward more! Then jog!

194
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,732
What are <i>you</i> doing here?
You're done training, aren't you?

195
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,941
Take your sorry ass home!

196
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,905
What's with you? You want to take me?

197
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,324
-Mikami-san!
-Uh, what?

198
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,994
Teach me a way to sink my right
into Ippo Makunouchi's face!

199
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,537
What?

200
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,832
I'm talking about my right straight
that you said blew you away.

201
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,626
How can I take advantage of it?!

202
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,381
Anything I say is useless
as long as you keep relying on your right.

203
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,550
A skilled fighter knows
how to use his left.

204
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,721
That's it! Tell me more!
How do I use my left?!

205
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,766
If you want, I don't need to knock
him down, I just need a way to win!

206
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,267
It's a bit late for that.

207
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,978
You were so hung up on winning with KOs!

208
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,066
I still feel the same about that.

209
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,027
But things are different this time!

210
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,071
I don't care if I only win by one point!

211
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,865
I want to win at any cost!

212
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,161
Well, I am your trainer.

213
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,164
If that's what you want to do,
we'll start tomorrow.

214
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,917
No, we'll start now.

215
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,211
Start now? Are you nuts?

216
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,174
Teach me what you just mentioned.
It was something about left punches.

217
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,176
Just a minute. Hey!

218
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,938
NISHIKAWA BOXING GYM

219
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,860
It's great that you're so eager
to train and all that,

220
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,195
but don't you think you've
been overworking yourself?

221
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:27,491
Not really. I don't feel tired
because I'm looking forward to the match.

222
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,707
To tell the truth, I'm a little anxious.

223
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,126
I feel better when I'm training.

224
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,589
I guess it's easy to tell
what I'm thinking.

225
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:47,219
Well, I don't quite understand
the mindset of a small-shot like you,

226
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,597
but just don't ruin your health.

227
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,973
I know.

228
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,811
But this is all I have.

229
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,703
Don't drag your feet! Dash!

230
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,460
Where have you been?

231
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,754
Idiot. Oda's roadwork, of course!

232
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:27,051
I told him he needed stamina most,
so I got stuck training him personally.

233
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,886
Did he come up with the idea?

234
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,056
I didn't think he would last three days,
but it's been a week today.

235
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,600
I heard you guys haven't been
seeing each other lately.

236
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:38,604
Yeah. Yusuke said we shouldn't see
each other until the match.

237
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,441
I see! He came up with the idea, did he?

238
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,610
He always had the gift.

239
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:49,114
His rusty right punch just
might come back to life in this match!

{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

241
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,789
What's wrong, kid?! Raise your guard!

242
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,916
You'll take Oda's right straight
in your chomper!

243
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,295
Force yourself close into him!

244
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,172
Give him a barrage of body blows!

245
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:18,352
All right! Remember that combination
of punches to the body and face!

246
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,728
Yes, sir!

247
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,730
Those were great body blows!

248
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,982
You're pretty good

249
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,985
if you can maintain that kind of attack
against a six-rounder like me.

250
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,070
-Thank you so much!
-Sure!

251
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,364
-What are you doing?! Get over here!
-Uh, right!

252
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,142
124 pounds.

253
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,436
Makunouchi has passed the weigh-in.

254
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,604
Next, Oda.

255
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,614
124 and a half pounds.

256
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,869
Oda has also cleared
the limit for the featherweight class.

257
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,915
This is the first time you've entered
a match looking so lean.

258
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,208
You've got a chance.

259
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,713
Why are you getting afraid?
Go and greet him!

260
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,258
-He's your senior in this world, you know.
-Uh, right.

261
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,761
Excuse me...

262
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,266
Pleased to meet you. I'm Ippo Makunouchi.

263
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,185
I'm glad to make your acqu...

264
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,398
-I'll let you judge whether I'm a clown.
-Huh?

265
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,406
Chief, are you sure he's gutless?

266
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,408
He's nothing like you told me!

267
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,621
<i>A man without a spine wouldn't
be able to build that kind of body.</i>

Make sure to get
plenty of rest until then.

My debut match. The day has finally come!

00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,911
<i>You want to be like me, don't you?</i>

275
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,497
<i>If so, you at least got to try this.</i>

276
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:30,252
<i>Let's see here. You should
be able to grab at least ten leaves.</i>

279
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,880
Match One, Makunouchi-kun. It's time.

280
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:16,882
Right!

281
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,240
-Let's go!
-Right!

282
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,984
-Oh!
-Here he comes!

283
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,026
Give him heck, Ippo!

284
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,529
Go throw those punches!

285
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,069
<i>Damn!</i>

286
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,114
<i>How can I be so nervous
after all I've done to get here?!</i>

287
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,491
<i>I must focus on the match!</i>

288
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,335
The first match of
the featherweight class,

289
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,338
scheduled for four rounds,
is ready to begin.

290
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,333
<i>Cuts. Blood spewing from wounds.</i>

291
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:42,379
<i>The cornerman has the techniques
to stop the bleeding like magic.</i>

292
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,674
<i>But the magic is wearing off.</i>

293
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,760
<i>At this rate, I will lose!</i>

294
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,889
<i>No! It's my debut match!
I've worked so hard for this day!</i>

295
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,393
<i>I won't accept defeat like this!</i>

296
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,937
<i>Next time, "Obsession for Victory."</i>
