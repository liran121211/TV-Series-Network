ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,692
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,648
<i>Here he comes!</i>

4
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,275
<i>I have to stand my ground!
If I don't get near him...</i>

5
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,236
<i>I have no chance of winning!</i>

6
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,864
Go! I don't care if you're too aggressive!

7
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,199
Charge in all the way!

8
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,619
<i>Don't stop! Keep going!</i>

9
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,787
<i>Once I get close to him,</i>

10
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,748
<i>he'll throw his in-fighter-killing
left uppercut for sure!</i>

11
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,917
<i>I only have one chance!</i>

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,503
<i>I must concentrate on
the movement of his left hand!</i>

13
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:11,923
<i>When is it coming?</i>

14
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,008
<i>When?!</i>

15
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,556
<i>He isn't using his left uppercut!</i>

16
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,517
What?!

17
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,523
<i>Huh?!</i>

18
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,777
<i>As you wish, I'll take
your challenge! Let's in-fight!</i>

19
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:38,741
FORWARD! FORWARD!

20
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,539
<i>He isn't using his left uppercut!</i>

21
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:48,251
Oh, my! Hayami has taken
an in-fighting pose.

22
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,752
Is this some kind of strategy?

23
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,840
<i>Fighting on their own ground to
show them just how outclassed they are</i>

24
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,717
<i>gives the experience meaning.</i>

25
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,678
<i>Why didn't he use his left uppercut?!</i>

26
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,555
Don't let it throw you off, kid!

27
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,765
You'll just have to
be defiant and fight him!

28
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,060
<i>He's right! He can't use
his shotgun at this range!</i>

29
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,688
<i>I have a chance at close-range fighting!</i>

30
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,441
Why is Hayami in-fighting?

31
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,652
It's part of his showboating.
He likes to show off his superiority

32
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,031
by beating his opponents
with their own techniques.

33
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,617
That bastard. When will the insults stop?!

34
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,712
<i>This can't be happening!</i>

35
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,298
<i>He's blocking me easily
at this close range!</i>

36
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,426
<i>Damn. Ippo is confused.</i>

37
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,053
<i>His punches are off rhythm.</i>

38
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,776
Didn't he just slip?

39
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,988
No. Hayami's right connected dead-on
before he fell.

40
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,743
Ippo was out-punched at in-fighting!

41
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,829
No, he just took a fluke hit right
when he slipped.

42
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,422
<i>It's no good.</i>

43
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:21,928
<i>I thought I had some advantage,
but he's a better in-fighter too.</i>

44
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,307
<i>It's not that he couldn't
use his uppercut...</i>

45
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,271
<i>He didn't need to use it!</i>

46
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:35,942
<i>How does it feel to be defeated
at your own specialty?</i>

47
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,361
<i>I allow the opponent to
show his power at 80% to 90%,</i>

48
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,446
<i>and then beat him with my own 100% power.</i>

49
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,033
<i>This is what makes me stand out.</i>

50
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,035
Hayami-kun!

51
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,832
Stand up, Ippo!

52
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,334
Are you going to let it end
with your face in the dirt?!

53
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:58,089
What was that week of intensive training
at camp with us for?

54
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,176
<i>That's easy for you to say.</i>

55
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,264
<i>I'm way outclassed!</i>

56
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,892
<i>The fact of the matter is...</i>

57
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,730
<i>I did great to get this far
in the Rookie King Tournament.</i>

58
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,983
<i>Please do your best...</i>

59
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,902
<i>Please do your best to
become Rookie of the Year.</i>

60
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,406
<i>As long as you keep winning,
we can also be proud.</i>

61
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,492
<i>That's right.</i>

62
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,745
<i>If I lose like this,</i>

63
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,040
<i>I would make Ozuma-san
and Kobashi-san look bad for losing to me!</i>

64
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,210
I'll be waiting at the final as promised.

65
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,340
<i>I can't...</i>

66
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,305
<i>...let it... end like this!</i>

67
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,392
Right on!

68
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,645
Oh, my! Makunouchi got up!

69
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,647
He stood up at the count of eight!

70
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,692
<i>Oh, okay. Let's do a double demonstration</i>

71
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:04,030
<i>so I can show you just how
different our boxing levels are</i>

72
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,907
<i>using your precious in-fighting.</i>

73
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,910
<i>I'm not going to back down now!</i>

74
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,916
Now, they have both paused
in the center of the ring.

75
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,376
Will they start duking it out
at close range again?

76
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,924
<i>It doesn't hurt!</i>

77
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,557
<i>I won't let it end with
him looking down on me!</i>

78
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,310
<i>Why, you!</i>

79
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,581
Why, you...!

80
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,876
Hey, Hayami backed away from him.

81
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,213
Even though none of
Makunouchi's punches connected.

82
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,966
He's regained his rhythm.

83
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,970
<i>Hayami pulled back because
he got overwhelmed by the kid's drive.</i>

84
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:13,474
<i>I'm sure he just backed off
from a close-range fight.</i>

85
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,853
<i>None of my punches have connected,
but I overwhelmed him.</i>

86
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,188
<i>Now I'm going to get in his face
and challenge him!</i>

87
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,815
<i>Don't push your luck.</i>

88
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:21,983
<i>I backed off because</i>

89
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,609
<i>accidents can happen at close range.</i>

90
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,321
Yeah, Hayami! Go for the win
with out-boxing!

91
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,241
Good work, kid!

92
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,660
Your powerful punches
made him chicken out!

93
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,495
Keep letting them fly!

94
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,581
<i>Me, chicken?!</i>

95
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,916
<i>I just got a little nervous, that's all.</i>

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,586
<i>I'm going to be taking a major role
in the world of boxing</i>

97
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,671
<i>so I can't afford mistakes
in a place like this.</i>

98
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,759
Whoops! Hayami gives him a clean one-two!

99
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,553
The distance is advantageous to Hayami!

100
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,804
<i>Get close to him!</i>

101
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,312
<i>He's been out of reach since
the moment he used his footwork on me.</i>

102
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,064
<i>You and I are different species!</i>

103
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,818
The bastard is real flamboyant
when he sticks to out-boxing.

104
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,403
Hayami-kun!

105
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,907
{\an8}Pulverize that wild boar of a kid!

106
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,700
Did you just call him a boar?!

107
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,953
Is that any way to talk about
a guy who's fighting his hardest?!

108
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,498
Now. Don't be so excited.

109
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,210
Actually, I wouldn't mind
being called a wild boar myself!

110
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,671
Jeez! You're a doting fool
when it comes to women.

111
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,173
Hayami-kun!

112
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,217
Go for it!

113
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,843
What the hell is that thing?!

114
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,429
Do you want a middle-weight punch
in your fat, little head?!

115
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,515
You don't have to go that far.

116
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,185
You idiot! Take a good look at
that woman's face!

117
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,730
She's hot.

118
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,067
<i>I've got to get close to him!</i>

119
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,575
<i>I'm going to run him down, run him down</i>

120
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,077
<i>and catch him!</i>

121
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,833
<i>Damn, he's persistent.</i>

122
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,086
<i>Good, he doesn't like it.</i>

123
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,885
Hey, Hayami's starting
to back into the ropes.

124
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,137
He's using the footwork
I trained with him at camp!

125
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,307
He's gradually cornering him
using small shifts in weight!

126
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,820
<i>I finally cornered him!</i>

127
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,282
<i>You bastard... Give it your best shot!</i>

128
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,159
<i>I'll give you a taste of
this the moment you jump in.</i>

129
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,455
<i>He has no place to go.
He'll use it this time for sure.</i>

130
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,667
<i>He'll use his in-fighter-killing
left uppercut!</i>

131
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,885
<i>Got you!</i>

132
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,139
<i>Here it comes!</i>

133
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,183
<i>I have to synchronize my right hook to it!</i>

134
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,188
<i>What?! A counterpunch?</i>

135
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,940
<i>Go!</i>

136
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,692
<i>I'll get you first!</i>

137
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:31,589
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

138
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,592
<i>What?! A counterpunch?</i>

139
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,385
<i>Go!</i>

140
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,095
<i>I'll get you first!</i>

141
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,937
My God, it's punch-for-punch!

142
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,484
Hayami's left and Makunouchi's right
collide simultaneously!

143
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,447
<i>I felt an impact! How did I do?!</i>

144
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,372
<i>No way! It didn't do anything!</i>

145
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,041
Damn, it was too shallow.

146
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,044
Now he knows what Ippo's aiming for!

147
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,880
Hayami won't throw another uppercut
like that again.

148
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,425
But we practiced
that counterpunch so hard together!

149
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,851
<i>How could it have had no effect?!</i>

150
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,397
<i>If he can take my right hook, I'm through!</i>

151
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,698
Hey, what are you doing?!

152
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,908
Punch each other!

153
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,118
What's wrong?

154
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,869
Are you boys in love or something?!

155
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,287
<i>That's easy for you to say.</i>

156
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,374
Kid! What are you doing?!

157
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,584
Staring won't get you anywhere!

158
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,503
Hayami's back is to the rope!

159
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,297
Attack him while you can, you idiot!

160
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,178
Argh! Worrying will get me nowhere!

161
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,518
His lower body took a hit! He took damage!

162
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,358
<i>He's right! My counterpunch did hurt him!</i>

163
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,526
<i>All right!</i>

164
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,363
Oh, no! Hayami, get away from the rope!

165
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,240
The power of Makunouchi's punch is real!

166
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,666
Whoa, Hayami is dodging! He's dodging!

167
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,752
He's defending as if he never took a blow!

168
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,173
<i>His lower body
should be out of commission,</i>

169
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,674
<i>but he's dodging everything!</i>

170
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,927
He's taking advantage
of the rope's elasticity.

171
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,762
His amateur boxing experience

172
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,641
allows him to cope with any situation.

173
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,479
Oh, no!

174
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,898
The shotgun!

175
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:01,238
Damn, we're back to square one.

176
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,909
He needed to use this round
while Hayami's still reeling,

177
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,204
but it won't be easy to break through
those shotgun punches.

178
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,499
<i>How do you like that?
I've still got my trusty shotgun.</i>

179
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,627
<i>As long as I have this,
you won't be able to get near me.</i>

180
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,630
Makunouchi has been pushed
back by the barrage.

181
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,716
He wants to press on,
but the shotgun punches have him blocked!

182
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,593
He's going in again!

183
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,303
Get a new routine!

184
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,933
Hayami-kun, knock him down!

185
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,644
Right on, Hayami! Keep it up!

186
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,190
Makunouchi can't get near him!
He keeps getting hit by the shotgun!

187
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,986
<i>I guess you haven't had enough.</i>

188
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,907
He's too fast.

189
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,202
Pull back, Ippo! You're in trouble!

190
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,538
<i>Yes, he's fast! However...</i>

191
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,540
<i>he's not using his hips.</i>

192
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,542
<i>He's only using his arms!</i>

193
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,794
<i>This is nothing to fear!</i>

194
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,298
<i>If I sway too wide, I can't counterattack!</i>

195
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,801
<i>I need to make tiny dodges!</i>

196
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,764
Makunouchi has started to dodge!

197
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,141
Hayami's barrage slices into thin air!

198
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,145
Now it's Makunouchi's turn to show off!
What a superb defense!

199
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,397
<i>This isn't happening.</i>

200
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,441
<i>This isn't happening!</i>

201
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,070
<i>Impossible!</i>

202
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,239
<i>He's dodging without a wasted movement.</i>

203
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,449
<i>He can see the punches clearly.</i>

204
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,756
<i>Hayami, I hear that your next opponent
is the most reputable</i>

205
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,383
<i>hard puncher in the tournament.</i>

206
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,260
<i>Do you have a strategy to deal with him?</i>

207
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,054
<i>If he was anyone worthy of tactics,</i>

208
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,473
<i>I would think of something.</i>

209
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,518
<i>So, do you mean,
you don't need a strategy for Makunouchi?</i>

210
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,520
<i>I didn't say that.</i>

211
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,983
<i>I mean that I don't cut corners,
no matter who my opponent may be.</i>

212
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,445
<i>Like the lion that uses
his full power to catch a rabbit?</i>

213
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,905
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

214
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,867
<i>I have...</i>

215
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,454
<i>my shotgun.</i>

216
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,498
<i>As long as I have this,
no one will ever defeat me.</i>

217
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,919
<i>Or rather, I can't ever let anyone
defeat me.</i>

218
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,676
It's a hit! The impact is terrific!

219
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,265
<i>I can't believe it! He beat my shotgun.</i>

220
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,392
<i>My shotgun!</i>

221
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,563
<i>I can't let someone like him beat me!</i>

222
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,066
<i>This is my chance! I have to jump in now!</i>

223
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,067
<i>Punch him!</i>

224
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,612
Don't hesitate, Ippo!

225
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,073
His gut is wide open!
Use your upper, your upper!

226
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,952
<i>This is nothing!</i>

227
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,954
<i>You bastard!</i>

228
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,748
Hayami! Push him away with your barrage!

229
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,750
He's hurting from the body blow!

230
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,669
Close in on him and knock him down!

231
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,423
Hayami counterattacks!
He can't lose to a barrage!

232
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,800
He desperately punches back!

233
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,760
<i>I won't lose!</i>

234
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,721
Makunouchi follows suit!
His willpower is impressive!

235
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,557
A right punch from Makunouchi!

236
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:20,104
<i>I can't afford to lose on
a small stage like this!</i>

237
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,774
A left from Hayami! Was it effective?!

238
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,818
<i>I'm going to steamroller you!</i>

239
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,977
Whoa, he's down! Hayami is down!

240
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,313
Down! Makunouchi, he's down!

241
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,816
Go back to your neutral corner!

242
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:19,913
The referee waves his arms!
The match will not continue!

243
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,916
The fight is over!

244
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,293
It's an upheaval!

245
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,377
Advancing to

246
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,672
the Eastern Japan Rookie
Championship Tournament, Ippo Makunouchi!

247
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,469
I... I did it.

248
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,888
I won.

249
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,102
All right!

250
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,315
He won! He's going to the final!

251
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,275
Hey, this is great!

252
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,943
Hooray!

253
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,445
Well, I'll be!

254
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,156
You did it! You did it, Ippo-kun!

255
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,242
Yagi-san, Chief, I did it!

256
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,412
Yeah, you did great.
That was a spectacular rush.

257
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,955
-Ippo!
-Ippo!

258
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,418
-I won!
-Yeah, you pulled it off!

259
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,712
You did an awesome job, you bastard!

260
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,932
<i>Cry me a river!</i>

261
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,727
This is the first time his cheering squad
has seen him lose.

262
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,063
I bet it's a real shock for them.

263
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,193
This'll be a serious blow for him,
with the publicity he was getting.

264
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,070
He has a tough time ahead of him.

265
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,614
Huh? Well, yeah...

266
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,032
I guess so.

267
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,743
It's a little sad
when this happens to a genius.

268
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,079
Hayami...

269
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,041
Hayami. Hey, can you hear me?

270
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,132
Hayami.

271
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,806
Why, you! I'm amazed you won!

272
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,809
Don't make us nervous like that, you fool!

273
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,106
You took a clean hit.

274
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,025
But you know what?

275
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,403
Your true ability is far above his.

276
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,865
Let's use this loss to bounce back and...

277
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,199
Loss?

278
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,788
So, I lost.

279
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,750
We're having a tough time
believing you lost too.

280
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,004
-I see.
-What?

281
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,549
So, I lost.

282
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,098
I'll be all right.

283
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,810
Even Ali and Raynard lost once in a while.

284
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:51,523
In fact, they showed
their legendary strength after they lost.

285
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,990
Well, please keep your hopes up.

286
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,242
The next time I stand in the ring,

287
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,829
it'll be the beginning of
Ryuichi Hayami's legend.

288
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,206
Or something.

289
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,499
Why, you...

290
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,002
Hayami-kun, please try again another time!

291
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,671
-Don't be sad!
-I love you!

292
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,007
Don't get depressed over this!

293
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,009
I'll be there for your next match!

294
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,386
I love you, Ryuichi!

295
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,556
Humph! What is that?!
He's almost acting like he won.

296
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,267
I was a fool to feel any sympathy for him!

297
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,144
I'm in trouble.

298
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,105
I was planning a feature article on Hayami
for next month's issue.

299
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,399
What a drag. Is this for real?!

300
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,152
Maybe all that publicity went to his head.

301
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,029
Yeah. He fell asleep at the switch.

302
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,532
<i>Yes, Hayami was careless.</i>

303
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:46,286
<i>But that's only a minor point.</i>

304
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:53,168
<i>Makunouchi won due to
his unbelievable growth as a boxer.</i>

305
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,632
<i>Who is next? Miyata or Mashiba?</i>

306
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,009
<i>Either way, it's too important to miss.</i>

307
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,434
Well, the most important thing
was that Ippo won by counterpunch!

308
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,812
Don't forget that he was coached
by a genius!

309
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,854
You idiot!

310
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,941
He won because of the footwork
I taught him at camp.

311
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,318
That's what turned the tide.

312
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,153
No, it was his counterpunch!

313
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,113
Footwork!

314
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,241
Now, now! Does it really matter
what did it?

315
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,535
The credit goes to everybody.

316
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,914
Yes. I won today
thanks to all of your efforts!

317
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,251
I learned footwork from Kimura-san,

318
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,253
the counterpunch from Aoki-san,

319
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,214
the Chief taught me defense,
among other things,

320
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,841
and Takamura-san taught me...

321
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,679
Takamura-san taught me...

322
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,266
Huh?

323
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,311
You ungrateful bastard!

324
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,314
Anyway, thank you,
everyone, for all your help!

325
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,649
It's too late to beg for your life now!

326
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,068
My right punch will send you to your doom!

327
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,278
No, thanks!

328
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,116
<i>I don't know how,</i>

329
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,827
<i>but I managed to get
to where I promised to,</i>

330
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,287
<i>Miyata-kun!</i>

331
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,125
KO TIME: 1R, 2 MINUTES, 59 SECONDS
