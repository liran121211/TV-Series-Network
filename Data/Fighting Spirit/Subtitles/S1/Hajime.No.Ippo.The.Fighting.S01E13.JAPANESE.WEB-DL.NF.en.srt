Here!

00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,350
Wow, is this your treat?

6
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,269
To celebrate your first anniversary
with the gym.

7
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,063
Oh, thank you!

8
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,731
Go ahead and eat up!

9
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,399
You're not the guy paying for it.

10
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,361
Come on. Go ahead and eat!

11
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,154
Okay, I will!

12
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,117
Has it really been a year already?

13
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,451
Uh, yeah.

14
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,204
It's almost time for
the Rookie King Championship Tournament.

15
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,874
You're probably dying to find out
who your first match opponent is.

16
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,417
Yeah.

17
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,629
Actually, you're right.
I've been a nervous wreck.

18
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,756
The Rookie Championship, huh?

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,510
It didn't leave much of an impression
on me because I won it so easily.

20
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,679
He overwhelmed them, that's why.

21
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,431
Kimura-san, Aoki-san, how did you do?

22
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,891
Huh?!

23
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,434
Uh...

24
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,439
I believe Kimura got dumped by a chick
and developed a life-threatening fever.

25
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,400
That's not true.

26
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,944
I had a high fever from a cold
before I got dumped.

27
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,405
There isn't much of a difference.

28
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,575
Uh, how about you, Aoki-san?

29
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,911
Did I ask something I shouldn't have?

30
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:46,207
I'll have you know
that I lost in the first match,

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,129
but my opponent was said
to be the champion hopeful!

32
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:55,008
I went all four rounds with him
on equal footing, but he won by decision.

33
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,135
You don't have to be so depressed!

34
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,137
You did great against a champion hopeful!

35
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,430
Do you really think so?

36
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,309
That "hopeful" lost easily
in the second match, though.

37
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,396
Yeah, but even the strongest boxer
can get hit by a lucky punch.

38
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,108
The dude who won against the hopeful lost
in the third match hands-down.

39
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:17,196
And the guy who beat that guy
flopped in the fourth match.

40
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,449
Damn it!

41
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,494
I'm sorry! I never should have asked
such a stupid question!

45
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,762
Wait! Hold on!

46
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,057
Damn, the kid is way too fired up.

47
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,308
Kimura, tag.

48
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,062
Man, that's pathetic.
And you call yourself a six-rounder?

49
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,021
Shut up!

50
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,358
When he gets in your range,
he's impossible to handle.

51
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,736
Ippo is getting his in-fighting
down to an art.

52
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,447
He's gotten so tough it makes me mad.

53
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,700
All right, I guess
I'll go rough him up a bit.

54
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,868
Ippo-kun!

55
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,955
We received the fax regarding
the Rookie King Tournament.

56
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,665

FEATHERWEIGHT CLASS EASTERN JAPAN
ROOKIE CHAMPIONSHIP TOURNAMENT CHART

58
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,086
Let's see... Where's Ippo?

59
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,545
He's in Block A.

60
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,006
Miyata and Mashiba
are both seeded in Block B.

61
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,466
They would be!

62
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,552
Ippo's lucky those two
will have to eliminate each other.

63
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,431
Still, he has to defeat
everyone seeded in Block A.

64
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:30,228
{\an8}According to this, he can't fight
Miyata unless he gets to the final match.

65
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,980
This is pretty tough.

66
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:36,025
Uh, yeah. But I'm more curious
about my first match opponent.

67
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:36,943
What is his name?

68
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:37,986
{\an8}IPPO MAKUNOUCHI (KAMOGAWA GYM)
JASON OZUMA (HACHINOHE BOXING GROUP)

69
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,572
Jason... Otsuma?
Is that how it's pronounced?

70
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,993
That's an unusual last name.
Maybe it's common in Hachinohe region.

71
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,287
Yagi-chan, we need to start scavenging
for reference.

72
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,579
Right!

73
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,457
At any rate,
"Jason" certainly is a bold ring name.

74
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,295
Yeah. It makes you conjure up
a gruesome image.

75
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,547
In contrast, we've got "Makunouchi."

76
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,341
-Huh?
-His name is lacking punch.

77
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,803
What do you say we come up
with a ring name for Ippo?

78
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,306
What? A ring name for <i>me</i>?

79
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,474
Why don't we counter
his Jason with "Freddy Ippo"?

80
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,144
Hmm... It lacks something.

81
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,229
Then how about "Puma Ippo"?

82
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,481
It doesn't fit his image.

83
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,276
All right, I have just the thing!

84
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,528
"Big Mutha' Ippo."

85
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,866
Hey, that sounds kind of cool!

86
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,994
I know what "big" means,
but what does "Mutha" mean?

87
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,247
This is what Mutha' means!

88
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,335
<i>I'll be out doing roadwork.</i>

89
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,420
-Wait a minute, Ippo!
-Huh?

90
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,672
How about "Papa Ippo Third Leg"?

91
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,925
I don't want a ring name anymore!

92
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,972
-Fujii-san.
-Hey there.

{\an8}‪KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

94
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,893
{\an8}What? It's not a ring name?

95
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:56,147
Oh, come on! No Japanese person
has a name like that.

96
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,108
-Exactly. He's not Japanese.
-What?

97
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,612
His real name is Jason Ozuma.

98
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,907
He's an American soldier stationed
at Misawa Base in Aomori Prefecture.

99
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,409
Is this possible?!

100
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,412
{\an8}He's a puncher boxer
with an orthodox style.

101
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,624
{\an8}His record so far is
three out of three, all KOs.

102
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,667
{\an8}Huh? Is that all you have on him?

103
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,797
Well, he's fought only
in the Tohoku Region up north,

104
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,216
so we don't have much info on him here.

105
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,344
I've already contacted our branch office
in Aomori Prefecture

106
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,180
and they're gathering more intel,
but according to rumors,

107
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,016
he's quite powerful.

108
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,643
What are you going to do, Ippo?

109
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,312
What am I going to do?

110
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,355
I have to fight him.

111
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,940
That's right!

112
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,776
At this point,
instead of adjusting to his style,

113
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,445
you must refine your own style.

114
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,697
Uh... Yes, sir!

{\an8}HACHINOHE BOXING GROUP

116
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,626
Hey, Ozuma! Finish him!

117
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,677
-Hey, are you all right?
-Yes.

118
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,638
Okay, that's perfect. Nice hook!

119
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,267
Oh, no! You're bleeding!

120
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,477
Are you all right?

121
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,272
I'm fine. This is nothing!

122
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,900
Oh, really? I was very worried!

123
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,486
Thank you for helping me practice!

124
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,157
At any rate,
his hook is as fierce as ever!

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,660
Yeah, it is Ozuma's finishing blow.

126
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,621
Are you all right?

127
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,291
Yeah, but if I hadn't been
wearing headgear,

128
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,793
my head would have flown off!

129
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,256
Ozuma, you're going to Tokyo today.

130
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,467
Call it a day and go get changed.

131
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,595
Oh, okay!

132
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:56,726
Amazing. Not only is he talented,
he's very diligent about training.

133
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,730
I told him to take it easy
for the day of his departure, though.

134
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,607
No wonder you ran out of things to teach...

135
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,233
after the third match since his debut.

136
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,944
The upcoming
Rookie King Championship Tournament

137
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,198
is the perfect stage for a local boxer
like Ozuma to become famous.

138
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,993
I desperately want him to be a success!

139
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,247
Oh, Mama-san!

140
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,959
What is it? You're training today too?

141
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,128
I am always training.

142
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,381
Anyway, it takes strength to fix
the sandbag leather.

143
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,549
I'll do it for you.

144
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,717
Oh, don't worry about it.

145
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,304
You're a boxer,
so just focus on your training.

146
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,015
No! I'm the one who wrecks the sandbags.

147
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,768
I should be the one to fix it.

148
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:43,022
If you get hurt doing stuff like this,
my husband will get mad at me.

149
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,693
Mama-san, I'll get stronger.

150
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,112
I'll get stronger and become a champion

151
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,532
so I can buy everything,
gloves and sandbags.

152
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:56,160
Then you won't have to go through
any difficulties.

153
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,787
Oh, what are you talking about?

154
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,250
Don't worry about something trivial
like this and just fight for yourself.

155
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,045
No. I want to fight for my family.

156
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,047
Ozuma...

157
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,802
I've already spoken to the president
of the Nerima Boxing Group.

158
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,388
I'll join you as soon as I can.

159
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,182
Japanese people are all so kind.

160
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,269
I'll be fine. I have no worries
about going by myself.

161
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,064
I just wish I could help you
with your fine tuning.

162
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,860
You all stuck with me
until you were all exhausted.

163
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,779
Thanks to you, I got strong!

164
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,615
Aw, cut it out.

165
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,828
We know that you didn't use even half
your real power sparring with us.

166
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:43,583
We don't want to admit it, but we're
no longer good enough to fine-tune you.

167
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,627
{\an8}Oh, come on!

168
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,673
{\an8}You have a long face
for someone who's leaving to fight!

169
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,426
{\an8}But you're all saying such sad things.

170
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,428
{\an8}Become the rookie champ, Ozuma!

171
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,097
{\an8}You can overcome the disadvantages
of training in a rural gym.

172
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,683
We'll be at your match to cheer you on!

173
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,728
Ozuma, take this with you.

174
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,480
Everything is expensive in Tokyo.

175
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,107
It's not much, but here's something.

176
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,485
I have my own spending money!

177
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,447
-I don't need it.
-Just take it.

178
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,202
Mama-san... Everyone...

179
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,914
Good luck, Ozuma!

180
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,627
-You can do it!
-We'll be there to cheer for you!

181
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,129
Good luck!

182
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,089
Don't lose, Ozuma!

183
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,883
<i>You'll see, guys.</i>

184
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,094
<i>I will win!</i>

KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

186
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,064
Ippo looks more fired up than usual.

187
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,525
What do you think would happen
if you had to fight a Black boxer?

188
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,028
Well, to be honest,

189
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,405
I wouldn't be able to exert
even half my power.

190
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,865
Yeah.

191
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:02,453
Most boxers who represent the USA,
the boxing kingdom, are Black.

192
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,914
But what do you think
of Ippo's tough stance?

193
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,999
Maybe he isn't as freaked out
as he should be.

194
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,544
Maybe he'll be able to
keep his cool under pressure.

195
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,049
<i>Jason Ozuma-san.</i>

196
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:19,845
<i>I bet he's tough.
Fujii-san said he was tough.</i>

197
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,473
<i>No! I'll lose heart!</i>

198
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,766
<i>If I keep winning,</i>

199
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,102
<i>I'll eventually be matched against
someone very strong.</i>

200
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,814
<i>So, it's happening sooner than later,
that's all!</i>

201
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,816
-Wow!
-He's full of spirit.

202
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,276
<i>I can only fight Miyata-kun
in the final match!</i>

203
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,445
<i>I have to keep winning until then!</i>

NERIMA BOXING GROUP

206
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,844
Those are great sounds. Who is he?

207
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,264
He's Ozuma. He's under our care
while he's in Tokyo.

208
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,640
Ah, so that's him.

209
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,685
At any rate, he's got great spring.

210
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,145
-Hey, Ohta!
-Huh?

211
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,274
Aren't you both entered in the Rookie
Tournament in the featherweight class?

212
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,652
You're the hope of our gym,
but you're going to have it rough, huh?

213
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,070
What?

214
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,781
You're lucky you're in different blocks.

215
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,704
-Hey, Ozuma-san!
-Huh?

216
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't train in that little corner.
Want to step into the ring?

217
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,461
Didn't you come here
to find a sparring partner?

218
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,713
Since we're here,
want to have a sparring session?

219
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,424
Sure! But is that okay?

220
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,968
We are both entered in the same
Rookie King Tournament.

221
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,179
Oh, don't worry about that.

222
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,723
Let's just box light,
like in preliminary practice.

223
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,975
Yeah.

224
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,728
Hey, Ohta and Ozuma are going to spar.

225
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,480
I wouldn't want to miss this!

226
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,981
Yeah, because Ohta's also tough.

227
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,026
Ohta-san, what about your headgear?

228
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,279
I don't need that junk!

229
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,531
Come on! What's wrong with you?!

230
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,034
Ohta-san, please put on your headgear!

231
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,368
What?!

232
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,208
Oh, is that all?

233
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,792
I guess he's not as strong.

234
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,378
Hey, you're fragile.

235
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,547
Is it true you
can't find a sparring partner?

236
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,261
<i>Go show them what you've got
and give it your best!</i>

237
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,014
<i>You can do it!</i>

238
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,393
I can't believe you had the nerve
to tell me to put on headgear.

239
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,415
{\an8}H... Hey, Ohta. Ohta!

240
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,960
{\an8}Get a stretcher! Call an ambulance!

241
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,711
{\an8}‪KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

242
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,382
{\an8}Yes. With a single hook, he sent
his sparring partner to the hospital.

243
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,135
Apparently, Ohta has withdrawn
from the Rookie King Tournament.

244
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:10,057
Jason Ozuma is far stronger
than we initially thought.

245
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,143
So, his finishing blow is a hook.

246
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,355
For Ippo, whose asset
is close proximity fighting,

247
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,857
that's the worst type of punch.

248
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,531
Takamura! Come here a second.

249
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,324
Huh? What is it, old guy?

250
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,118
What?

251
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,622
-Kid!
-Uh... Yes, sir!

252
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,499
Put on your gloves and get into the ring!

253
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,835
-Huh?
-Hop to it!

254
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:46,051
Um... I'm sorry, but I need to use the ring.

255
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,011
What?

256
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,515
Rejoice! I'll be your sparring partner!

257
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,933
What?!

258
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,268
What are you screaming about?

259
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,895
Takamura-san can't be my partner!

260
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,646
He's seven classes higher than me!

261
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,023
If I take a punch, I'll die!

262
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,025
What did you say?!

263
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,697
<i>It's hopeless. He'll make me do it anyway.</i>

264
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,202
Listen! You must dodge Takamura's hook.

265
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,370
What?

266
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,587
Wow! This is a great way
to relieve stress.

267
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,131
You idiot! Don't punch him out of nowhere!

268
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,050
I was in the middle of my explanation!

269
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,760
Jeez! Get to the point.

270
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,306
If I hadn't been wearing headgear,
I might have been killed!

271
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,768
Which means you would've
just been killed by Ozuma.

272
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,852
Huh?

273
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,022
That hook was a simulation
of Ozuma's finishing blow.

274
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,191
-What?
-You're kidding!

275
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,443
Takamura-san's punches
are more destructive

276
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,155
than featherweight level punches,
even with those 16-ounce gloves on.

277
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:52,409
Are you saying that Ozuma's hook
is on the same level in power <i>and</i> speed?

278
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,078
No. In speed alone,

279
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,872
Ozuma's hook may be
comparatively superior to Takamura's.

280
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,501
Black people are better at producing
instantaneous bursts of muscle power.

281
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,089
<i>However, in the event
his hook swings and misses,</i>

282
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,549
<i>he will temporarily be thrown
into a vulnerable state.</i>

283
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,804
If you can slip through Takamura's
hooks and return even one punch,

284
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,515
you will be given that moment!

285
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,810
What? I have to dodge <i>those?</i>

286
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,020
There's only ten days to the match.
Can I do it?

287
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,106
If you can't, your first match

288
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,817
of the Rookie King Championship
will also be your last!

289
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,781
The final match of
the Eastern Japan Tournament!

290
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,409
That's the only place I'll wait for you.

291
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,995
I have no choice.

292
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,830
I understand, sir. Please instruct me!

293
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,249
All right, start with ducking.

294
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,751
Refine your ducking technique
as much as humanly possible!

295
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,919
Yes, sir!

296
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,340
<i>I got to do better than this.</i>

297
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,511
<i>There's no way I can compete
with Ozuma-san.</i>

298
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,972
<i>I understand the theory, though.</i>

299
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,140
Huh?

300
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,311
<i>It's about this height.</i>

301
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,229
Okay!

302
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,114
<i>This is hard!</i>

303
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,241
<i>But if I practice it over and over...</i>

304
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,955
Ouch!

305
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,749
<i>Again!</i>

306
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,797
<i>I practiced lots
with those horizontal bars.</i>

307
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,216
<i>I'll dodge his hooks today for sure!</i>

308
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,010
Good afternoon!

309
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,641
Oh, you're here!

310
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,811
I wasn't totally up-to-snuff yesterday,

311
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,980
so I warmed up in advance for you today.

312
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,444
Now, let's start your fun,
intensive training.

313
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,697
Thanks for your help... in advance.

314
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,203
<i>I guess one day of practice wasn't enough.</i>

315
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,997
Okay.

316
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,957

319

I'm ready!

320
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,476
-All right!
-What?

321
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,522
An upper?

322
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,983
To prepare you to react to
unexpected timing of hooks,

323
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,195
I'll be mixing
in all kinds of punches, all right?

324
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,240
What? That's mean!

325
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,211
<i>No! I won't make it in time!</i>

326
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,422
<i>No! I have to keep trying!</i>

327

329
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,602
Ippo-po?

330
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,106
You're finally wakey-wakes.

331
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,190
Your face...

332
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,067
While you were sleeping,

333
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,153
he said he didn't want to lose his rhythm,

334
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,529
so I got pulp-faced.

335
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,822
I'm so sorry.

336
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,365
Say that to Kimura, too, okay?

337
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,826
Hey!

338
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,871
Why is this happening to me?!

00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,082
Hey!

340
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,001
What's the matter?

341
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,043
Takamura-san!

342
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,212
Oh, you're awake.

343
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,590
-I'm sorry I kept you waiting!
-Huh?

344
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,809
Hurry!

345
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,229
-Hey, slow down.
-But we'll miss it! Hurry!

346
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:53,609
<i>Family... I never had a family
to begin with.</i>

347
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,944
<i>When I was relocated to the base in Japan,</i>

348
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,404
<i>no one came to see me off.</i>

349
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,364
<i>My life was filled with loneliness.</i>

350
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,869
<i>I thought working out would distract me,
so I started boxing.</i>

351
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,039
<i>The people in Japan were very kind to me.</i>

352
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,627
<i>Now, everyone at the gym is family to me,</i>

353
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,503
<i>and I will work hard for my family.</i>

354
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,132
<i>That is the only reason I fight!</i>

355
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,261
<i>No matter who my opponent is,
I cannot lose.</i>

356
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,639
<i>I can't afford to lose!</i>

357
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,891
I can take more!

358
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:30,270
Shut up! It's no fun
to flatten a flounder!

359
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,149
By the time I see it,
it's too late to react!

360
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,776
Hey...

361
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,945
Your face is back to normal.

362
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:41,114
Yeah. I'm taking fewer punches
directly in the face now.

363
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,908
Aw, that's no fun.

364
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,703
Yeah, but lately I've been taking
a pounding to the back of the skull,

365
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,372
and it makes me feel light-headed.

366
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,833
Moron! It's your fault
for not dodging them.

367
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,878
If you stay like that,
you'll get beat up in the real match.

368
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,297
Uh, right! I'll keep working on it!

369
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,592
He just doesn't give up, does he?

370
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,135
Yeah, he's a real stickler.

371
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,096
If it were me, I would have half-given up

372
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:08,475
when I found out my sparring partner
was "King Unreasonable."

373
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,355
<i>Like I said, why is
this happening to me too?</i>

374
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,404
<i>I feel like I'm so close
to grasping the timing.</i>

375
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,203
<i>Left... Right... Left!</i>

376
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,500
I did it! If I can slip through this fast...

377
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,420
No, it's no good.
I need to completely avoid contact.

378
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,431
KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

379
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,270
<i>I... I did it.</i>

380
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,271
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

381
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,274
-All right, Ippo! Go for it!
-Punch that bastard!

382
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,485
What?!

383
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,158
Ippo, are you alive?

384
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,827
Takamura-san,
it's not fair to use your elbow.

385
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,287
What? Oh, shut up!

386
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:15,042
<i>At any rate, it looks like
he did it in the nick of time.</i>

387
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,289
<i>The hook. You bend your elbow,
and punch from the side,</i>

388
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,416
<i>dragging your whole body with it.</i>

389
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,419
<i>It has bad chemistry with boxers
who tend to charge forward.</i>

390
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:46,007
<i>But if I can dodge that hook,
it will create a window of opportunity!</i>

391
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,843
<i>I've done everything I can.</i>

392
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,761
<i>All I can do now is do my best.</i>

393
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,348
<i>The opening bell of the
Rookie King Championship is about to ring!</i>

394
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,394
<i>Next time, "Powerful Arms!
Hook vs. Uppercut!"</i>
