00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:14,431
ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,692
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,388
<i>No matter who I'm up against,
I can't afford to lose!</i>

4
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,473
<i>Counterpunch!</i>

5
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,736
-This is bad!
-He took one right in the face!

6
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,363
Mashiba rushes Miyata!

7
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,740
Miyata can't get away!
He's being pulverized!

8
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,286
He's down! Mashiba, stop!

9
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,206
Stop it, Mashiba!

10
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,716
This is explosive!
Mashiba catches Miyata in a barrage!

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,510
Can Miyata stand?!

12
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:25,520
TO THE PROMISED PLACE...

13
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,779
It's a reversal.

14
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,032
It's a reversal!
What an incredible barrage of punches!

15
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,993
Down! This is explosive!

16
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,287
Mashiba catches Miyata in a barrage!

17
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,627
-Did you see that?
-Yeah. That was a nasty trick!

18
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,756
He stepped on his foot.

19
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,640
Ichiro!

20
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,310
<i>Damn...</i>

21
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,896
<i>Now you've done it, Mashiba!</i>

22
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,197
<i>Stupid idiot. Stay down and die.</i>

23
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,159
He won't be able to stand.

24
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,410
Yes, he will!

25
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,288
Miyata was never good at taking hits.

26
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,041
There's no way he can stand
after taking that many.

27
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:32,170
That's irrelevant! He will stand up!

28
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,381
<i>G... Get up.</i>

29
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,759
<i>You have to get up.</i>

30
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,719
<i>He always got up!</i>

31
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,973
<i>He always got back up again!</i>

32
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,476
<i>To keep his promise with me!</i>

33
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,896
<i>He got up as many times as it took!</i>

34
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,440
<i>I have to do the same for him!</i>

35
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,651
<i>I cannot</i>...

36
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,736
<i>lose!</i>

37
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,497
Hey, he's going to get up!

38
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,831
Miyata means business!

39
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,083
Miyata-kun!

40
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,094
Go for it, Miyata!

41
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,804
Go for it, Miyata!

42
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,180
Stand up!

43
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,435
Hey, Ichiro!

44
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,321
He got up!

45
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,865
He's up! Miyata has gotten
back to his feet after what

46
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,867
appeared to be a decisive knockdown!

47
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,620
-Can you continue?
-I can!

48
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,998
He got up, see?

49
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,126
Hmph. He has to do more than just stand.

50
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,632
<i>You should have stayed down.</i>

51
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,933
If he goes down one more time
in this round, it's over.

52
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,268
So, what's the damage?

53
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,895
He seems to be fully conscious,
but he's hurting bad.

54
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,566
He won't be able to throw good punches
in that condition.

55
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,402
In the meantime,
Mashiba is beginning to recuperate.

56
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,987
The odds are against Miyata.

57
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,280
It's all right!

58
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,492
Miyata-kun has a counterpunch
that will turn the game around.

59
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,910
I know it'll be all right.

60
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,582
<i>I'm going to slaughter you!</i>

61
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,544
He's going to launch an all-out attack!

62
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,462
Run, Miyata-kun!

63
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,964
Don't force yourself!
Keep a distance and persevere!

64
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,351
Amazing! He's dodging
without using his legs!

65
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,853
Miyata is awesome!

66
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,230
But he isn't moving.
Miyata's legs are hurting.

67
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,318
Mashiba's slices are serious.
Can he withstand them?

68
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,569
Miyata-kun.

69
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,204
Mashiba is throwing roundhouses,
going for a knockdown.

70
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,457
Still, I can't believe Miyata-kun is
dodging so well without using his legs.

71
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,292
He went down once, but he's calm.

72
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,841
Mashiba lashes out, but to no avail!

73
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,594
Miyata shows his skill by dodging
with his upper body alone!

74
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,679
He's good! He'll get through it!

75
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,597
Nope.

76
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,350
He's starting to get caught!

77
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,852
Without his footwork, he's at his limit.

78
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,940
<i>Bastard, you keep squirming around.</i>

79
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,943
<i>Don't be a bad loser!</i>

80
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,407
He did it!

81
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,954
Counterpunch!

82
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,164
A perfect burst catches Mashiba off guard!

83
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,418
It didn't faze him much.
I thought it connected cleanly too.

84
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,421
Yes, I thought so too.

85
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,924
Maybe it wasn't effective
because of that knockdown.

86
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,430
Still, that one punch
had a major effect on him.

87
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:14,058
If you take a good punch right
when you believe you can go all the way,

88
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,935
it gets difficult to jump in afterwards.

89
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,445
Is he on the lookout for counterpunches?
Mashiba has stopped moving!

90
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,699
The boxers stare each other down.
Who will make the first move?!

91
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:34,454
<i>Damn you! Why are you pulling back now?</i>

92
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,956
<i>All you have to do
is deliver the fatal blow!</i>

93
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,630
Stop! Round two is over!

94
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,344
So far, each boxer
has taken one knockdown.

95
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,679
Neither has yielded an inch.

96
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,565
Good job, Mashiba.

97
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,985
Giving him that many blows
at once will leave him hurting.

98
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:10,031
You have another chance in the next round!
But don't go in hastily!

99
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,576
His counterpunches are still a threat.
Calm down and wait for your chance.

100
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,623
<i>Calm down?! If I calm down,
the match will end!</i>

101
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,917
<i>There are only two more rounds left.</i>

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,253
<i>His last counterpunch was his best shot.</i>

103
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,341
<i>Damn! I managed to withstand it,</i>

104
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,593
<i>but this last round
was my chance to nail him!</i>

105
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,347
<i>I failed to bring him down, dammit!</i>

106
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,808
<i>I survived his best shot.</i>

107
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,144
<i>It didn't hurt that much.</i>

108
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,900
It was unfortunate
you got your foot stepped on.

109
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,402
Try to recoup during the interval.

110
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,238
Once your footwork comes back,

111
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,448
you'll never take a punch like that again!

112
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,203
Don't touch it, Dad.

113
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,704
He'll notice.

114
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,707
So, your foot <i>is</i> injured.

115
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,502
What? What did you say?!

116
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,295
It probably happened when you got hit

117
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,048
by his right straight,
while he was standing on your foot.

118
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,926
By the look of it,
it's more than a light sprain.

119
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,972
It's twisted, or even worse.

120
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,478
An out-boxer with a foot injury
is like a bird with a broken wing.

121
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,272
Mashiba has recuperated.

122
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:28,025
It's too risky for you to fight him
in your condition.

123
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,737
Let's withdraw from this match.

124
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,993
I hate to say it, but he's right.

125
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,329
If you strain yourself now,
it will affect your future.

126
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,956
You are still young.

127
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,000
You can always start over!

128
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,210
Let's withdraw from this match.

129
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,879
I'm sure it's mortifying,
but it's nothing to be ashamed of.

130
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,256
It was an accident!

131
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,637
That's how it goes.

132
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,060
ROUND 3 REMAINING TIME

133
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,395
Seconds out!

134
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,897
I'll tell the referee.

135
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,113
<i>He's waiting for me.</i>

136
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,700
Hey, Miyata!

137
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,912
Ichiro!

138
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,206
Don't be stupid!

139
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,085
You know first-hand
that this is impossible.

140
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,797
You might jeopardize your boxing career.

141
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,550
I have to go.

142
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,388
He's waiting for me.

143
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,395
Round three!

144
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,697
Oh my, Miyata has the business
look on his face.

145
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,658
It looks like he's recovered
from the damage.

146
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,577
If only his footwork would return,
it'll go like the first round.

147
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,204
I hope you're right.

148
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,957
This is too dangerous!

149
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,710
Even if he wins,
what if the injuries are long-term?

150
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:19,095
I strongly believe Ichiro-kun is
beyond the domestic boxing level.

151
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:23,057
How could you let someone
with his talent go to his doom like this?!

152
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:28,396
It's up to the fighter to
decide whether it's meaningful or not.

153
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,983
He went in there
because he decided it was meaningful.

154
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:37,988
If that's his decision, it isn't
a cornerman's place to say otherwise.

155
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,493
All we can do is watch over him.

156
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,538
What?! Miyata's foot is hurt?

157
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,415
I suspected as much,

158
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,418
but after seeing the face of the guys
in his corner, I'm sure of it.

159
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,753
He must have a serious injury.

160
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,049
Look. Miyata isn't using
his signature footwork because he can't.

161
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,094
That's dangerous. Why didn't
his cornermen stop him?!

162
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,554
They probably couldn't stop him.

163
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,598
Miyata made his decision.

164
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,105
I'll be waiting at the final as promised.

165
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,860
Miyata-kun.

166
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,447
It'll be tough fighting Mashiba
on one foot.

167
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,408
But unless Mashiba-san notices,
he can still use his counterpunch...

168
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,171
<i>I see. So, your foot is injured.</i>

169
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,549
<i>And it's your pivoting foot,
of all things.</i>

170
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,011
He noticed.

171
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,728
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

172
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,980
He noticed the foot injury.

173
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,611
<i>If your pivoting foot is toast,</i>

174
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,030
<i>you can't put any weight
into your punches.</i>

175
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,742
<i>Which means both your killer
counterpunch and signature footwork</i>

176
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,577
<i>are now totally useless to you.</i>

177
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,668
Mashiba is taking the hitman stance again!

178
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,505
He's going to torture
him to death with flicker jabs.

179
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,179
<i>Here it comes!</i>

180
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,101
Mashiba throws a barrage of flicker jabs!

181
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,269
However!

182
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,773
He's ducking! He's ducking
the flickers without using his legs!

183
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,484
Miyata's instinct for
defense never ceases to impress me!

184
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,487
<i>Damn! But I'm going to hold my ground!</i>

185
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,953
He has to brace his feet
to guard from body blows.

186
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,246
He's doing it on purpose?!

187
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,247
He's not cheating!

188
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:56,794
Attack your opponent's weakness!
That is the iron rule of fighting.

189
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,087
That's harsh.

190
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,091
<i>Still, that looks like a serious injury.</i>

191
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,842
<i>It looks painful just to keep standing.</i>

192
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,344
<i>I'm not through with you yet!</i>

193
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,890
<i>Here comes another one!</i>

194
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,854
Miyata-kun is taking everything Mashiba
wants to throw at him!

195
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,775
There's nothing he can do about it.
He can barely stand.

196
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,279
To Mashiba, it's like punching a sandbag.

197
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,157
<i>Persevere until you have
the best chance for a counterpunch!</i>

198
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,284
Keep fighting, Miyata!

199
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,786
Can't you stop being punched?!

200
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,293
What's this? Miyata is holding up
his left foot.

201
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,461
Huh? What's up with Miyata's left foot?

202
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,671
Actually, that is strange.

203
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,508
Why isn't Miyata using his footwork?
He's so good at it.

204
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,722
Miyata-san, he can't stay in there
any longer!

205
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,599
Throw in the towel! Miyata-san?!

206
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,769
-He can't go on!
-Referee, stop him!

207
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,939
<i>No way! I won't let anyone stop me.</i>

208
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,526
<i>I won't be satisfied until
I finish this with my own two hands!</i>

209
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,777
He's going to finish!

210
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,828
He did it!

211
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,830
He got Mashiba when he let his guard down!

212
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,040
Go for it!

213
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,001
<i>I got him! This is it!
I've got to knock him down now!</i>

214
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,131
Argh! Miyata isn't going in!
More to the point, he can't!

215
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,966
He's done in. He can't move his feet!

216
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,967
Miyata-kun!

217
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,723
<i>What a piece of work!</i>

218
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,142
<i>He threw a solid punch at me.</i>

219
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,852
<i>Wasn't he at death's door?!</i>

220
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:41,982
<i>No, he won't fool me.
That punch was his last.</i>

221
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,318
<i>Hell, he can't even move!</i>

222
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,821
<i>I've got to finish him
before it's too late!</i>

223
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,992
Mashiba rushes Miyata again!
He showers him with blows!

224
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,327
He goes in for the finish!

225
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,411
Miyata can't hit back!

226
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:59,416
<i>So what if my foot's hurting?!
Mashiba's hurting as well.</i>

227
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,335
<i>Punch him! This is the critical point!</i>

228
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:07,174
A succession of punches
scores dead-on! Mashiba has Miyata!

229
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,347
He's completely in his grasp!

230
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,099
Oh, no! Referee, stop him!

231
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,398
<i>Miyata-kun.</i>

232
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,369
-What is it?
-What's wrong?

233
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,377
He's still punching,
but Mashiba-san is retreating.

234
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,730
<i>Who the hell is this guy?!</i>

235
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,775
<i>Isn't he just a spoiled brat
who always sucks up to daddy?!</i>

236
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,487
<i>How can he endure so much?!</i>

237
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,660
Miyata-kun.

238
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,788
<i>I must win.</i>

239
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,126
<i>That's right, be threatening.
That's the way, Miyata!</i>

240
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,176
<i>I must win!</i>

241
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,439
<i>Counterpunch!</i>

242
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,860
The timing is bang on!

243
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,946
It's going to hit!

244
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,060
The winner, Mashiba!

245
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,313
The match is over!

246
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,399
Ryo Mashiba wins the deathmatch
in the second semi-final match

247
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,528
of the Eastern Japan
Rookie Championship Tournament!

248
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,446
Three rounds, in two minutes, 22 seconds,

249
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,198
he beat Ichiro Miyata by KO,

250
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,742
securing his advancement
to the final match!

251
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,083
<i>I won.</i>

252
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,335
-Ichiro!
-Miyata!

253
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,637
The timing for the counterpunch
was perfect.

254
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,347
But he was already out of energy.

255
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,896
It was a tough match.

256
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,566
But you did a great job.
That was a great victory!

257
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,540
Where is Makunouchi-kun?

258
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,584
He went to Miyata's green room.

259
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,752
The guy took a bad fall.

260
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,337
He's probably worried sick.

261
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,967
He never regained consciousness
in the ring.

262
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,346
Miyata was more advanced in ability
by a level or two.

263
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,641
Damn, boxing is unpredictable.

264
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:51,857
Actually, what's scary
is Mashiba's drive to win.

265
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,778
Now, it's Makunouchi
versus Mashiba for the final.

266
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,531
They'll be striving for a KO.

267
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,826
<i>Up until now,</i>

268
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,871
<i>Miyata was the only thing in Ippo's head.</i>

269
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,834
<i>It's hard to believe that he lost
the goal that drove him this far,</i>

270
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,588
<i>the very thing
that he made it to the final for.</i>

271
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,589
MEDICAL ROOM ENTRANCE KEEP CLOSED

272
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,009
Miyata-san, how is Ichiro?!

273
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:19,927
Why did he lose?!

274
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,178
Give us a brief comment!

275
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,471
Miyata-san!

276
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,598
For now, he's regained consciousness.

277
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:28,894
He's responding to questions clearly,
so there's nothing to worry about,

278
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:32,981
but I can't say anything further before
putting him through a complete physical.

279
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,692
Any comment on his opponent Mashiba?

280
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,237
He stepped on his foot during the match.

281
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,446
What do you say?

282
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,449
Please give us a comment.
Just one comment!

283
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,452
In boxing, result is everything!
That means that the one who survives,

284
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,955
no matter how he did it,
was one notch higher.

285
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,707
That's all! Now get out of here!

286
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,967
Oh, it's you, Makunouchi-kun.

287
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,219
Um, how is he?

288
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,517
Ichiro asked me to tell you something
if you showed up.

289
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,394
Yes?

290
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,733
He says that he's sorry
he didn't keep his promise.

291
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,127
Okay, how about these?

292
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,753
They're light and cheaper.

293
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,007
The final match of
the Eastern Japan Tournament!

294
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,259
That's the only place I'll wait for you.

295
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:38,166
<i>Foul. A dangerous act
prohibited during a match.</i>

296
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,210
<i>The closer range a fight is,</i>

297
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,420
<i>the more likely it can happen.</i>

298
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,840
<i>It's a drama born of
desperation from both sides.</i>

299
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,426
<i>That's why we shouldn't do it
intentionally.</i>

300
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,929
<i>If you commit a cowardly act in a fight,</i>

301
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,889
<i>that's supposed to
showcase your hard work,</i>

302
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,059
<i>you will end up betraying your own work!</i>

303
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,146
<i>Next time, "Grudges, Sorrows & Dreams."</i>
