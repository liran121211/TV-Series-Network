00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:11,625
ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,958
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,166
<i>His body's wide open!</i>

4
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,625
That sounded awfully good.

5
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,333
<i>An elbow block!</i>

6
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:59,333
DEATH MATCH

7
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,041
<i>This is my chance.
I have to be aggressive!</i>

8
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,625
<i>I'll get him this time!</i>

9
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,583
<i>It happened again.</i>

10
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,333
<i>What's the matter?</i>

11
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,625
He used an elbow block!

12
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,333
So that's how he maintained
the hitman stance

13
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,541
without raising his left guard!

14
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:35,250
Although it is a legitimate defense,
it's still nasty.

15
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,583
Ippo's punches are powerful enough
to shatter his own fist.

16
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,333
Mashiba's elbow block
severs Makunouchi's momentum!

17
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,166
Makunouchi is not stepping forward.

18
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,083
A deadlock?

19
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,250
What do you mean?!
We have a way to attack.

20
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,583
Kid! Throw sporadic jabs,
and don't let him rest!

21
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,625
There will be an unguarded moment.
Seize it!

22
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,833
<i>He's right! I got him against the rope,
so I have to try!</i>

23
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:09,291
Mashiba is a level or two superior
at left punching.

24
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,708
<i>What's wrong? Aren't you going to hit
from the right anymore?</i>

25
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,833
<i>Or is your fist shattered
after only two punches?!</i>

26
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,916
This time, Makunouchi
is against the ropes!

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,250
Offense trades for defense!

28
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,791
All right, this is the perfect scenario.

29
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,250
Though you're the opponent,
I pity you, Makunouchi.

30
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,458
<i>It's not working!
I can't fight him from the left!</i>

31
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,958
Lash out, Ippo!

32
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,666
But he has no way to attack!

33
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,458
<i>Damn! What should I do?!</i>

34
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:54,625
Kid!

35
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,666
Makunouchi throws a right!
He went for another body blow!

36
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,666
<i>Why, you...</i>

37
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,791
<i>This is all... This is all I can do!</i>

38
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,708
<i>I believed I could win
if I practiced this.</i>

39
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,750
<i>This is the only way I can fight!</i>

40
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,291
<i>Learn another trick, fool!</i>

41
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,750
<i>As you wish,
I'll shatter your fist into pieces!</i>

42
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Makunouchi throws another right!

43
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,666
He doesn't care
if it lands on a block anymore!

44
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,958
You idiot! You're being too reckless!

45
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,083
If he keeps punching like that,
he'll seriously hurt his bones!

46
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,000
That idiot! I knew he would.

47
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,583
His pea-brain is full
of the image of Miyata

48
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,875
dragging his feet but still fighting.

49
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:58,041
No one would be able to stop him now.

50
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,375
Even if it means ruining his fists.

51
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,541
<i>You bastard! Give up already!</i>

52
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,041
<i>Son of a...</i>

53
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,791
Makunouchi throws another right!

54
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:25,916
Mashiba counters!

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,083
This is turning into a fierce cross-fight!

56
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,375
<i>Ryo...</i>

57
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,375
Damn it! His rights are all blocked...

58
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,708
even though he turned it
into an infighting match!

59
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:38,750
Mashiba is making less lefts
and it's easier to step in deep.

60
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,333
Technically, the match
is at the kid's pace, but...

61
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,041
What's wrong, Mashiba?!

62
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,458
Push him away with your flickers!

63
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:55,208
<i>Did he let Makunouchi in too far,
making it hard to use his left?</i>

64
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:01,625
<i>My right fist is getting numb.</i>

65
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,125
<i>You persistent bastard!</i>

66
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,291
<i>Flicker!</i>

67
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,375
<i>Feint?!</i>

68
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,541
Mashiba makes a chopping right!

69
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,791
Ippo!

70
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:33,083
<i>Is it hopeless?</i>

71
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,541
<i>I'm not finished yet!</i>

72
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,583
Makunouchi throws another right!

73
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,125
And it was explosive!

74
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,416
Mashiba is losing his balance!

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,125
Oh, my! Makunouchi also took damage!
He can't move!

76
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,125
Ippo-kun! Damn, and this is his chance!

77
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,750
Is he at his limit?

78
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:01,750
Hey...

79
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,000
What's this?

80
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,125
Mashiba's left arm is, uh...
is staying down!

81
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,916
What's wrong with Mashiba?

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,500
Chief!

83
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,375
The kid did it!

84
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,500
Hey, what's going on?

85
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,833
Could it be...?

86
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,125
He didn't show it on his face,

87
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,916
but the guy must've been bearing
it for quite some time.

88
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,875
He planned on shattering Ippo's fist
to make it easy for himself,

89
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,916
but instead, his elbow
got taken out first.

90
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,166
It's a left-killer that only Ippo can do.

91
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,458
Kid! This is your chance!

92
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,416
What are you doing?! Go for it!

93
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,625
<i>Oh, yeah! I have to go now!</i>

94
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,708
<i>Move!</i>

95
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,625
<i>Move!</i>

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,750
<i>That brat!</i>

97
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,916
<i>But I still have one arm left!</i>

98
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,791
<i>I... I did it!</i>

99
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,000
-All right!
-It's a good one!

100
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,125
Mashiba!

101
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,833
Good job! That's the combination!

102
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,250
Makunouchi launches a barrage!

103
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,125
And it's powerful!

104
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,500
It's taking its toll on Mashiba!
His legs are shaking!

105
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,125
This is Makunouchi's opportunity!

106
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,375
Makunouchi is also reeling
from his previous damage!

107
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,375
He's stuck!

108
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,041
You idiot! Shake off
that damage with willpower!

109
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,916
Finish him already!

110
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,750
<i>He's right. This chance
finally came my way!</i>

111
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,333
<i>I must finish him now!</i>

112
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,625
<i>It didn't hurt.
It didn't hurt, you hear me?!</i>

113
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,833
What's the matter?!

114
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,333
Go for it, Makunouchi!

115
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,625
Knock him down!

116
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,125
What a fight!

117
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,500
<i>After all those body blows,
Mashiba still won't fall.</i>

118
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,291
<i>What tenacity!</i>

119
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:21,625
<i>They say it's hard to use body blows
to fell a boxer with strong willpower.</i>

120
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,333
<i>To knock down Mashiba, he may have to...</i>

121
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,375
His chin! Aim at his chin!

122
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,208
Keep punching just like that!

123
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,833
He'll lower his chin for sure!

124
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,125
<i>What a guy! He's still taking it!</i>

125
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,250
<i>Damn it! If only
I could raise my left arm,</i>

126
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,416
<i>I'd fend off those wimpy body blows!</i>

127
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,083
Makunouchi connects another right!

128
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,625
Ryo!

129
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,708
<i>This is it!</i>

130
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,750
Man! He's clinching!

131
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,458
Push him away, Ippo!

132
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,000
Argh! The bell signals
the end of round two!

133
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,750
Mashiba corners him,

134
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,000
but Makunouchi regains the upper hand!

135
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,250
-This is a battle worthy of a final match!
-Return!

136
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,500
It seems inevitable
that the winner will be decided by KO!

137
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,208
Who will win this death match?

138
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,708
Mashiba or Makunouchi?!

139
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:45,500
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

140
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,333
Your ligaments are shot.

141
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,791
The veins around
the area are all busted, too.

142
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,500
His destructive power is not normal.

143
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,125
You did a great job!
You recovered lost points.

144
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,041
Keep it up...

145
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,166
is what I wish I could say,
but is your right fist all right?

146
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,166
Yes, sir! It's okay. I can still punch!

147
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,250
Why are you hiding pain from me?!

148
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,416
You idiot!

149
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,958
In what way is this okay?!
You reckless fool!

150
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,958
You're bleeding through
the thickly bound bandage.

151
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,958
If it was just some scraped skin,
it wouldn't look like this!

152
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,166
Ippo-kun?

153
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,958
Your shattered bones are already
poking out of the back of your hand.

154
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,333
If you keep punching the way you have,

155
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,458
you know what'll happen.

156
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,625
In a worst-case scenario,
you'll be finished and retired!

157
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:50,375
The rookie title is a mere stopover
for those aiming at higher titles.

158
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:54,000
Do you want to dwell on this crap forever
and ruin your future?!

159
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,541
Argh! I'm asking you
who'd be stupid enough

160
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:09,250
to risk one's boxing career
just for a freaking rookie title?!

161
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,750
I've never seen such a...

162
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,791
I guess I can't stop you.

163
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,416
Chief?!

164
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,791
We have no choice!

165
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,208
This boxer is determined to go
all the way.

166
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,958
All we can do is
minimize the injury to his fist

167
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,750
and give him pointers
on how to win this match.

168
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,541
That is a cornerman's job.

169
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,000
Chief...

170
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,375
Listen, don't use your right fist
for hard punches.

171
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,000
Clench it lightly and use it for feints
and sacrifice punches.

172
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:48,208
That should work on Mashiba to
some extent in his current condition.

173
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,750
But Mashiba-san is overwhelming.
My left won't be enough!

174
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,500
You'll use your right hand
at the very end!

175
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,791
Keep giving him body blows with your left.

176
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,958
He'll lower his chin for sure.

177
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,750
That's when you sink in your right! But...

178
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,500
That single punch must knock him down!

179
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,541
With your fist like that,
there is no second chance!

180
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,750
Right!

181
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,166
You got it? Use outboxing.

182
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,625
Use your feet to stay away from him.
Hey, Mashiba...

183
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,625
Seconds out!

184
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,625
Oops, I'm late!

185
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:30,625
Dang, that Nishimura doesn't know
when to stop talking.

186
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,708
What?

187
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,166
You idiot! I told you to use your feet!

188
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,916
This is absolutely amazing!

189
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,666
They've been going at it non-stop
since the bell rang!

190
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,250
Mashiba's right and Makunouchi's left!

191
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,458
It's a ferocious battle!

192
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:58,750
<i>If I get passive and use my feet,
he'll be all over me!</i>

193
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,708
<i>Even if I'm down to one arm,
I must charge forward and fight!</i>

194
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,791
<i>As long as the flickers stay away,
I can get inside!</i>

195
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,666
<i>A close-range fight
is exactly what I want!</i>

196
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,125
What's the matter, Kumi-chan?

197
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,500
He's still fighting, isn't he?

198
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,500
I've had enough.

199
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,416
What?

200
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,083
I can't bear to watch it anymore.

201
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,875
If he's fighting for me...

202
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:28,916
I want him to stop!

203
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,250
Please stop.

204
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,333
Kumi-chan.

205
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:42,541
Oh? Is the punching
balance gradually getting tipped?

206
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,666
Left from Makunouchi!

207
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,791
Good!

208
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,958
The length of Mashiba's arms makes
his infight turning that much slower!

209
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,000
The current distance is perfect for Ippo!

210
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,250
Kumi-chan, let's go watch anyway.

211
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,500
Your brother is in a pinch, right?

212
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,000
If you don't root for him, who will?

213
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,500
<i>It's working! Just a little more!</i>

214
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,541
<i>Just a little more
and he'll lower his chin!</i>

215
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,541
<i>Damn! If only I could use my left,
I'd wipe the floor with him!</i>

216
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:20,791
<i>My legs!</i>

217
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,875
<i>Makunouchi scores a left!
Mashiba changes his position.</i>

218
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,083
<i>Right! It grazes him!
Mashiba leans forward!</i>

219
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,541
<i>Makunouchi shakes free!</i>

220
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,500
<i>Mashiba keeps his distance
and Makunouchi chases!</i>

221
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,000
<i>Left! He dodges!</i>

222
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,000
<i>Makunouchi ducks and dodges!
It doesn't connect!</i>

223
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,000
Ryo...

224
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,208
Kumi-chan, hurry!

225
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:48,125
<i>Mashiba suffers! Makunouchi's left!</i>

226
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,000
<i>It's a barrage of lefts!
Mashiba is at his mercy!</i>

227
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,041
Two... three punches! More hit home!

228
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,291
Mashiba has lost all function in his legs!

229
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,000
However...

230
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,791
However!

231
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,416
However, Mashiba is still standing!

232
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,625
Mashiba is standing in the ring
at his full height!

233
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,125
Mashiba?!

234
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,333
<i>That little shit!</i>

235
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,458
<i>I'll give him kudos
on his fighting spirit!</i>

236
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,000
<i>But he's at his limit.</i>

237
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,416
<i>One more punch,
and his huge frame will droop like a daisy</i>

238
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,583
<i>and his chin will fall!</i>

239
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,833
<i>One more punch, and he'll fall!</i>

240
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,833
<i>I can't afford to lose!</i>

241
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,958
<i>I got him! Did it work?!</i>

242
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,666
His chin dropped!

243
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,458
All right! Go, kid!

244
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,416
<i>All right, now for a right!</i>

245
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:04,375
<i>I... I can't lose... in a place like this.</i>

246
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,208
<i>Ryo</i>...

247
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,833
Welcome back, Ryo!

248
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,000
You must be tired.

249
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,791
What, are you still awake?

250
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,166
What about you?

251
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,166
You just got home from work.
That must be rough.

252
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,041
I got canned again.

253
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,750
Hey, don't let it get you down,
and find another job!

254
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,208
I'm working part-time

255
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,000
and we're making ends meet,
so don't worry.

{\an8}COLLEGE EXAM PREPARATION

257
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,791
So, let's hang in there.

258
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,458
<i>Let's hang in there.</i>

259
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,500
Mashiba!

260
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,666
Ryo!

261
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,000
I can't lose!

262
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:56,750
What?!

263
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,416
What?

264
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
You're kidding!

265
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,625
<i>Hitman... flicker?!</i>

266
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,375
<i>He's bluffing! I don't have
to worry about flickers!</i>

267
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,375
<i>Go!</i>

268
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,166
Ippo!

269
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,458
Makunouchi has fallen!

270
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,291
A moment ago, his condition was dire,

271
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,458
but Mashiba pulls both a flicker
and a chopping right out of the fire!

272
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,833
Mashiba has literally
laid Makunouchi out to dry!

273
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,958
What a guy.

274
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:15,208
What horrific tenacity!
What horrific endless strength!

275
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:21,708
<i>Lie there... forever!</i>

276
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,791
Oh, come on. Get up, Ippo!

277
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,541
This is bad! He took a flicker
and a chopping right.

278
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,958
He fell for Mashiba's typical KO pattern!

279
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,791
<i>I can't... I'm sorry!</i>

280
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,083
<i>I'm sorry, Miyata-kun!</i>

281
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,333
<i>This guy is amazing!</i>

282
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,791
<i>How could he move his dead left arm</i>

283
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,333
<i>to make such an amazing punch?!</i>

284
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,083
<i>This guy is too much for me!</i>

285
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,958
<i>Mashiba-san's legs are shaking.</i>

286
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:19,125
<i>Oh, I see. I'm the one who's shaky.</i>

287
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,125
<i>No, it isn't me!</i>

288
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,375
<i>It's having an effect.</i>

289
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:32,666
<i>His last attack used up
his final shred of strength!</i>

290
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,166
<i>But he still managed to
squeeze out that much power.</i>

291
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,833
<i>Yeah!</i>

292
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,333
<i>Even Miyata-kun fought way past his limit!</i>

293
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,875
<i>I can't cop out just
because my right fist hurts!</i>

294
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,625
<i>How can I expect to defeat this guy
if I'm that weak?!</i>

295
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:59,333
Makunouchi grasps the rope!
He has not given up!

296
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,333
<i>I have to do better!</i>

297
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,500
Kid!

298
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:10,000
<i>I can't possibly beat this guy
if I'm that weak!</i>

299
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:16,541
He's up! Makunouchi has risen to his feet!

300
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:21,791
Kid...

301
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,250
Mashiba, you can do it!

<i>Ryo!</i>

303
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:35,125
<i>You bastard! You should've stayed down.</i>

304
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,875
<i>I was naïve to believe
I could fight fully without my right fist!</i>

305
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:43,041
<i>There's no way
I could defeat him like that!</i>

306
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,166
<i>I cannot afford to lose.</i>

307
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,041
<i>I will win! I'll beat you down
as many times as it takes!</i>

308
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,250
<i>I don't care if it costs me my right fist!</i>

309
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:57,250
<i>I'm fighting against an incredible boxer!</i>

310
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,625

<i>The body blow.</i>

313
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,833
<i>An attack aimed at the body
below the neck and above the belt line.</i>

314
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,000
<i>It deprives the opponent's stamina,</i>

<i>causing excruciating pain,</i>

<i>which forces him to lower his guard.</i>
