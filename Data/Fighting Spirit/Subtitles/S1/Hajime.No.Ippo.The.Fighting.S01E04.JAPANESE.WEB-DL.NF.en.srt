ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,583
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:42,333
<i>Finally, I start going to the gym today.</i>

4
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:47,166
<i>But will I be all right? I'm such a klutz.</i>

5
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,250
<i>I'm sure the training will be tough too.</i>

6
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,375
<i>Calm down!</i>

7
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,000
Hey, it's the new guy.

8
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:58,125
<i>I already nailed down the jab and
my straight punches aren't bad either.</i>

9
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,666
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

10
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,625
I'm sorry! I apologize!
I'm truly, deeply sorry!

11
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,916
-What the heck is he doing?
-What a weirdo!

12
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:14,916
SHADOW BOXING

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,958
KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

14
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,375
Whoa, I'm so nervous.

15
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,083
<i>All right, I'll be enthusiastic.</i>

16
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,958
What are you doing to me?!

17
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:37,291
Oh, sorry. You looked so tense.

18
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,791
I wanted to help you relax.

19
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,916
That doesn't mean you have to goose me!

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,458
What? Don't you know?!

21
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,541
Being goosed helps to relax you.

22
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,583
What? You must be joking!

23
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:55,041
I'm shocked. I thought everyone
in the world knew that.

24
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:59,083
We know of boxing champs who made sure
to goose themselves before a match.

25
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,208
What? Is that true? Um...

26
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,583
-I'm Aoki.
-And I'm Kimura.

27
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:08,541
Aoki-san, Kimura-san,
please forgive me for doubting you!

28
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,541
Hey, do they normally fall
for something like that?

29
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,250
No. Which means, this kid...

30
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,833
...will be fun to mess with.

31
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:18,833
Hello!

32
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,333
Hey! Good to see you again.

33
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:25,666
I'm Yagi, the general manager of this gym.

34
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,833
Pleased to meet you.

35
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,166
Let's cut to the chase.
In regards to your training...

36
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,166
Leave that to us.

37
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,083
What?

38
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,625
Let's go, new guy.

39
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,833
-Come with us.
-Hey, you guys...

40
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,083
-Don't worry.
-We'll take care of him!

41
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,333
Come on, you can't act on your own!

42
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,541
Aoki-san and Kimura-san,
are you going to be teaching me?

43
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,708
That's right.

44
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,000
We'll fill up your head,
starting with the basics.

45
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,333
Hey!

46
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,791
What does one normally start with?

47
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,625
Well, let's start with basic training.

48
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,208
Then, you'll just keep running!

49
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,916
Oh. What about sandbag work?

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,791
-Sandbag work?
-Cheeky kid.

51
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,750
If you think newbies get to
wear gloves right off the bat,

52
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:08,708
you're dreaming.

53
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:12,416
Phew, it's hot! Ah, you're here, Ippo.

54
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,958
Huh? What are you guys doing?!

55
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,083
No way.

56
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,833
Takamura-kun, please talk to them!

57
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,333
They're dead set on teaching Ippo.

58
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,041
What?

59
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,166
Who the heck put you guys in charge?!

60
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,041
You're putting out poor old Yagi-chan.

61
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,625
-Uh, well...
-You know...

62
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,750
You're a lifesaver, Takamura-kun.

63
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,291
I only did what was right.

64
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,875
Because it's my job to
teach Ippo how to box!

65
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,125
-What?
-Oh, come on!

66
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:42,333
-What a dirty trick.
-I knew you'd pull that, you gorilla!

67
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,958
What did you say?!
Who are you calling a dirty gorilla?!

68
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,250
You, that's who!

69
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,333
You won't get your way forever!

70
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:52,916
You idiots! I'm the one
who found him in the first place!

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,958
-So what?
-You just want a gopher!

72
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,541
You're the ones who want a gopher!
And everyone in this gym is my gopher!

73
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,666
-Who do you think you are?!
-Tyrant!

74
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,166
Shut up, gophers one and two!

75
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,416
-Who are you calling gophers?!
-In the first place...

76
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,541
-Settle down, all of you!
-Please stop.

77
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,833
Quiet!

78
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,416
Damn it.

79
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,791
What are you people doing?

80
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:30,416
We were, uh, offering to
teach our dear little junior!

81
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,333
Ha! If you guys were the teachers,
even a gifted student would be a flop.

82
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,666
What?!

83
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,875
Yes?!

84
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,166
-Ha ha! You got in trouble!
-Shut up, you!

85
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,166
Knock it off!

86
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,916
Go back to your own training!

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Takamura! You said you
were going out for road work!

88
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:51,916
Damn you!

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,666
Kid! Your coach is me!

90
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,375
What? Really, sir?

91
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,333
-What, you got a problem with that?
-Uh, no!

92
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,375
-Then go get changed!
-Yes, sir!

93
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,958
Man, Chief Kamogawa is scary!

94
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,666
I got to keep my wits about me.

95
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:30,541
Kid, put on gloves and get in the ring.
You're mitt-punching.

96
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,000
What? I'm allowed to wear gloves, sir?

97
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,375
When I tell you to do something,
be quick about it!

98
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,583
Yes, sir!

99
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,208
Hey, he's starting with
mitt-punching from the get-go.

100
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,625
He's skipping the basics.

101
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,041
The geezer knows what he's doing.

102
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:50,000
-What are you doing here?
-Shh! Be quiet or he'll spot me!

103
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,125
Um...

104
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,166
What's wrong? Go ahead and start punching!

105
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,291
But I'm not sure what to do.

106
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:00,666
All you need to do is to punch
the mitt wherever I put it. Hurry up!

107
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,000
Right!

108
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,375
That feels great!

109
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,166
Good! Next, from the left!

110
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,833
Next, left, then right!

111
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,875
Good! That was a one-two.
Don't you forget it!

112
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,666
-Yes, sir.
-Now, left!

113
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,166
Right! Come on! Again!

114
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,375
Again!

115
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:36,750
Whoa, those are great sounds.
He must have really powerful punches.

116
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,416
He's picking up the tempo too.

117
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,541
You're mistaken.

118
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,458
-The old man is the skilled one.
-What?

119
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:46,458
Those are the unpadded mitts.
Don't you guys remember them?

120
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,958
Oh, those! They make a great sound
and feel great to punch.

121
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,458
They give you the confidence to
get in the groove. That makes sense.

122
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,208
And look at the mitt positions.

123
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,916
That's good placement.

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,833
That would knock an opponent down.

125
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:03,041
He's acclimating him to punch angles that
will fell an opponent with a single blow.

126
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,833
That's what we call "That Kamogawa Magic."

127
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,958
Ha! His chin is going up!

128
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,541
He lasted the first round.
Not bad for a newbie.

129
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,833
All right, take a break.

130
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,875
That was the length of
one round in a standard match.

131
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,250
Make your body remember how long that is.

132
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,166
Yes, sir.

133
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,791
He's worn out.

134
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:35,291
Well, you can't expect
much more from a newbie.

135
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,041
All right! Second round!

136
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,250
What?!

137
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,666
Hey...

138
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,208
Does the kid come with that much stamina?!

139
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,791
Oh, you aren't the one
making those sounds, Takamura-san?

140
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,916
Huh?

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,541
Are you up to something again?
You never learn, do you?

142
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,416
-It's not what you think!
-Oh, I see.

143
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,833
Good going, kid.

144
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,083
If one of those hard punches
hits an opponent,

145
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,583
like say, Miyata, he would be in trouble!

146
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,000
What?

147
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:24,833
But it's totally out of the question,
because he avoids everything I throw.

148
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,875
Don't be so shy.

149
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,208
With me as your coach,
you'll be at his level in three months.

150
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:35,333
Hold on a minute! Everyone's listening.

151
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,208
Don't even say that as a joke.

152
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,708
I get it.

153
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,958
The only reason you couldn't touch him
during the sparring session

154
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,916
was because you only knew how
to attack straight ahead from the middle.

155
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:02,625
You have enough stamina to
continuously produce heavy punches.

156
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,875
Once you learn multi-directional attacks,

157
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,833
even a skilled boxer like Miyata
won't be able to stop you.

158
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:13,125
Just render his defense ineffective and
then make that single, destructive punch!

159
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:17,416
-In other words, victory is yours!
-Uh, right.

160
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,416
I don't expect dexterity from you.

161
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,958
I won't ask you to become
a skilled out-boxer with quick feet.

162
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,875
A cute little well-rounded boxer
has no appeal!

163
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,875
Brute force will overpower any technique!

164
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,833
Don't you want to catch up
to Miyata and outdo him?

165
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,500
It'd be great if I could, of course.

166
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,583
Do you have the motivation?

167
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,083
I'll do it!

168
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,541
Miyata-kun, I'm sorry!

169
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,708
Doh!

170
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, no. I made him mad.

171
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,333
You really are a strange one.

172
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,708
-So, you'll do it?
-Yes, sir!

173
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,000
Then learn this first!

174
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,875
It's called an uppercut.

175
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,333
Uppercut?

00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,666
Punching those mitts was so much fun.

178
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,625
Takamura-san and others
are kind too, albeit a bit odd.

179
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,708
But Miyata-kun sure was mad.

180
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:34,083
Argh! I need to get to sleep!
I have uppercut practice tomorrow!

181
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:42,333
I can't sleep!

182

00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,125
Oh, Miyata-kun!

185
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,916
Kid, why are you goofing around?!

186
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,375
At least get better at jump rope,
for God's sake!

187
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,416
Yes, sir!

188
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,666
-Get in the ring.
-Yes, sir!

189
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,375
All right, we'll work on
the form for the uppercut.

190
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:24,208
Lean your upper body further forward
and keep both knees bent.

191
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,166
Like this?

192
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,666
Pull your fists into your sides.

193
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,250
At this time, make sure
your knuckles are facing up.

194
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,166
Right!

195
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,791
<i>Show him your stuff, Ippo.</i>

196
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,166
Hey, I don't see any movement!

197
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,666
All right, now you got the form down.

198
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,416
All you need to do now is
extend your bent knees at full force

199
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,583
and use the momentum and your body to
thrust your fist upward.

200
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:49,666
Give it a shot.

201
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,458
<i>I lean my upper body forward,</i>

202
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,791
<i>extend my knees at full force

203
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,666
<i>and my body to thrust my fist upward.</i>

204
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,666
<i>Okay!</i>

205
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,541
<i>Extend the knees at full force,</i>

206
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,625
<i>and use the momentum and
my entire body to thrust my fist upward!</i>

207
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,833
-Aw, man.
-An empty swing.

208
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,583
<i>I don't believe this.</i>

209
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,000
Did you see the look on
Miyata's and the old man's faces?

210
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,500
They were freaked out!

211
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:35,916
Yeah, he had a nice form,
but why are you so excited about it?

212
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,333
Yeah, if he doesn't hit anything,
what's the point?

213
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,208
How long have you morons been boxing?

214
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,083
Don't you understand what you saw?!

215
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,000
When he finished,

216
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:50,000
his arm, knee, and toes
were in perfect alignment.

217
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,083
<i>It was the ideal uppercut form!</i>

218
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,958
<i>It proves that he has
outrageous destructive power.</i>

219
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,208
<i>A half-trained lower body
wouldn't be able to produce that.</i>

220
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,958
<i>Ippo is in a class of his own!</i>

221
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:09,208
You sure give me
something to look forward to, kid.

222
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,708
I want you to master this uppercut
in three months.

223
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:16,333
I can't wait to see
your re-match with Miyata.

224
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,833
After that kid debuts,
he may just keep winning without a hitch

225
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,916
and pass you losers in no time.

226
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,333

00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:37,125
That's right. While I'm out,
I want you to work on shadow boxing.

230
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,208
See? That's it.

231
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,708
Make sure to throw in uppercuts
as you go. Understand?

232
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,541
<i>I should've known.</i>

233
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,416
<i>He's not going to be by my side every day.</i>

234
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,208
<i>I feel a little uneasy all by myself.</i>

235
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,208
Shadow boxing?

236
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,291
Yes. I have no idea how to do it.

237
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,208
I get you.

238
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,375
It goes something like this.

239
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,791
-That's not good enough.
-What did you say?!

240
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,208
Now, <i>this</i> is shadow boxing!

You idiot!

242
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,250
Don't teach that kind
of unorthodox boxing to a newbie!

243
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,791
Who cares?

244
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:24,458
Your style is way too orthodox
and rigid to be effective in real matches.

245
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,916
You talk big for a guy
who loses a lot of real matches.

246
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,375
Your record doesn't look that hot either!

247
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,833

-Same to you, buddy!

Uh, guys?

249
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,583
This is shadow boxing!

250
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:40,500
No, this is how it's done!

251
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,583
<i>He doesn't appear to be
just swinging punches at random.</i>

252
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,666
<i>He's fighting something invisible.</i>

253
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,333
<i>I see! His opponent is imaginary!</i>

254
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,541
<i>Let's see, my opponent would be...</i>

255
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:14,083
<i>Someone way too strong popped
into my head!</i>

256
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,708
<i>But come to think of it, Miyata-kun
is the only one I've ever fought against.</i>

257
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,458
Huh? How does Miyata-kun move again?

<i>This isn't working!</i>

<i>I need to create the image
of his entire body!</i>

261
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,375
<i>He's fast! Now that I see it again,
I'm impressed by his incredible speed!</i>

Damn it!

-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

264
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:01,500
<i>How did he knock him down?!
