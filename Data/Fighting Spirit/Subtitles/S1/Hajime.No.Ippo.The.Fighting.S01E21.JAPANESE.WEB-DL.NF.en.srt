00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,692
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,394
Damn it!

4
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,520
<i>What incredible strength!</i>

5
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,648
<i>This guy is a true prodigy.</i>

6
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,736
<i>He overcame the issue of stamina long ago.</i>

7
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,115
<i>With the way I'm training now,</i>

8
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,701
<i>I'll never be able to defeat him.</i>

9
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,456
This sucks.

10
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,378
Well, at least Aoki will be grateful
to Hayami for the girl-packed audience.

11
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,256
Excuse me! Can I get past you?

12
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,926
Wasn't Hayami-kun way too cool?!

13
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,386
He was electrifying!

14
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,762
Yeah, totally!

15
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,312
Maybe the main event is less
of a draw than the curtain raiser.

16
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,229
Who cares?

17
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,774
I'll be able to focus on the fight better
without an audience to distract me.

18
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,528
Hey, there!

19
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,534
Hey, what's wrong?
Give me some solid backing, okay?

20
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,038
He's such a clown.

21
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,002
As I anticipated, it's a rummel-pummel
mudslinging match.

22
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,632
There isn't an ounce of spectacle.

23
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,258
Take that!

24
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,469
He did it! He got him with a left hook!

25
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,764
The winner is Aoki in the blue corner!

26
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:48,061
I did it! I won!

27
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,022
Holy cow! Takamura-san, I won!

28
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,316
The more he dances,
the more he looks like a clown.

29
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,525
That's not very nice.

30
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,362
-He won, so let's be happy for him.
-Did you guys see that?!

31
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,865
Yeah! I did it!

KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

34
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,423
I'm back!

35
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,345
It was a real hoot!
At that point, all the girls left...

36
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,681
Come on, can't we
talk about something else?

37
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,433
What? Hey, is that Miyata-kun?!

38
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,603
Why? What are you doing here?

39
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:40,780
I'm sorry. But... why are you here?

40
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,366
I happened to be doing roadwork nearby.

41
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,120
I thought I'd stop in and congratulate
Takamura-san on taking the belt.

42
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,039
Still, what was with that hug just now?

43
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,125
Sure, I always thought
you were a little queer,

44
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,043
but I guess it's true.

45
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,547
Oh, come on, Takamura-san!
You're such a kidder.

46
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,548
Right?

47
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,802
Not you too, Miyata-kun.

48
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,637
This isn't funny anymore.

49
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,647
How come you're all backing away from me?

50
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,525
Watch out for him, guys!

51
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,031
Hey! Stop running away from me!

52
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,160
Hold on a minute!

53
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,038
Anyway, go easy on him.

54
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,541
He's worked hard to get this far,
to fight you in the ring.

55
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,794
Believe it or not,
he's only got one more to go.

56
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,255
You guys are so mean!

57
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,804
One more to go.

58
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,766
But that last one is the problem.

59
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,143
You mean Hayami?

60
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,605
His specialty is a barrage
called the "shotgun," right?

61
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,649
I don't have a chance of stopping it.

62
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,109
If it were me,

63
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,614
I would shoot down every one
of them with my counterpunches.

64
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,785
<i>His self-confidence always amazes me.</i>

65
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,622
<i>I've come this far, but I don't
have nearly as much confidence.</i>

66
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,627
I'd like to hear some bravado from you.

67
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,880
Where's the usual
"I can beat him no matter what"?

68
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,133
But I...

69
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,888
Make sure you get past him.

70
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,643
I'll be waiting at the final as promised.

71
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,439
Miyata-kun!

72
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,697
It's him! It's Hayami!

73
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,450
Thanks for the interview!

OTOWA BOXING GYM

75
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,708
Another TV station?

76
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,211
He's a popular guy.

77
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,716
Hi there, Hayami.

78
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,884
Good afternoon.

79
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,512
I'm here to get your comments
on the next match.

80
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,806
Can I have a moment of your time?

81
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,975
No appointment as usual.

82
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:18,771
So, what did you think of
the tapes I gave you the other day?

83
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,315
You mean Makunouchi's matches?

84
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,445
I gave the most recent
one a quick once-over.

85
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,239
Makunouchi versus Kobashi.
You haven't watched the others?

86
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,242
I was a little disappointed.

87
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,369
Well, I understand you there.

88
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,623
That fight was
the worst of all four matches.

89
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,043
But I think you'd find
the Ozuma match to be informative.

90
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,503
It's all the same.

91
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,883
If he can't handle
an opponent of that level, he's nothing.

92
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,552
The other tapes
aren't worth watching either.

93
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,512
I'll win the semi-final hands-down.

94
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,889
Oh, really? Still...

95
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,350
I don't think you should ignore
his destructive power.

96
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,519
It's definitely number one
in this tournament.

97
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:03,065
If he gets you in an in-fight,
you could be in for a surprise.

98
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,569
He does seem to have a good punch. But...

99
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,780
Do you think it'll hit me?

100
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,368
Hayami! It's time to resume training!

101
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,788
Now, if you'll excuse me.

102
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,841
I'm going home now, sir.

103
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,092
Take it easy!

104
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,278
<i>He's training pretty hard.</i>

105
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,574
<i>Conceited boxers normally cut corners
on basic training.</i>

106
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,498
<i>But he's a boxing prodigy
who's never lost.</i>

107
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:05,169
<i>Maybe that's why he knows
how hard it is to keep on winning.</i>

108
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,171
{\an8}SHOIN HIGH SCHOOL

109
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,179
Then he'll do this...

110
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,141
It's no good. No matter what I do,
I don't see how I can win.

111
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,227
<i>If it were me,</i>

112
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,981
<i>I would shoot down every one of them
with my counterpunches.</i>

113
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,691
Hey, Ippo!

114
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,694
I want your opinion of
my right straight punch.

115
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,195
Uh, sure.

116
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,448
Take this! Right straight!

117
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,242
Hey, don't dodge it!

118
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,078
Forget it! I'm not your sandbag!

119
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,205
Okay, so why don't you punch back?

120
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,456
-Huh?
-Ouch!

121
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,210
You idiot! Don't punch me out of nowhere!

122
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,463
There are no warnings in boxing.

123
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,215
Oh, shut up!

124
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,218
If I knew it was coming,
I wouldn't let this knucklehead punch me!

125
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,017
Just maybe...

126
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,227
Huh? Did you say something?

127
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,356
{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

128
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,234
{\an8}What?! You want to
learn how to counterpunch?

129
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,111
Please, sir!

130
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,739
You fool. That is a highly advanced skill!

131
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,326
What if I know what punch is coming next?

132
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,578
What did you say?

133
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,205
There is a certain punch
I know he's going to use on me!

134
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,210
His in-fighter killing, short uppercut.

135
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,214
If I get close enough to him,
he'll definitely let me have it!

136
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,009
And you're proposing to
use a counterpunch against it?

137
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,510
Yes, sir!

138
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,597
What do you think?

139
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,225
It's nothing like your previous training
for Miyata and Ozuma.

140
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,227
Are you still up to it?

141
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,730
I'm prepared to go past my limit!

142
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,107
You never change.

143
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,985
All right! Put on your headgear
and get into the ring!

144
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,111
Yes, sir!

145
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,740
Good. It's time for my "Razor Upper"
to make some noise.

146
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,533
I heard everything.

147
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,995
I'll let the uppercuts fly
so you can practice countering them.

148
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,123
Wait a minute, Aoki-san.

149
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,001
You haven't recovered
from your last match.

150
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,378
Don't sweat it!

151
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,715
I'll do anything to help you beat
that bastard Hayami!

152
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,093
So, the clown thing
did bother him after all.

153
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,012
-Huh? Did you say something?
-Uh, no.

154
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,015
I'll be with you all the way,
so beat him no matter what!

155
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,517
Right!

156
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,729
Kid! To counter an uppercut, use a hook.

157
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,273
Time your hook as if to put
a cap on his uppercut!

158
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,858
Right!

159
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,279
Take this!

160
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,412
That's too pushy!
Look carefully before you step in!

161
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,621
{\an8}Right!

162
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:48,541
{\an8}THE NEXT DAY

163
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,842
What's the matter with you?

164
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,553
You haven't made any progress
since yesterday!

165
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,889
What's wrong?

166
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,101
Nothing. It's just difficult
to see your punches.

167
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,645
Besides, it's easier to move around
without headgear.

168
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,897
But it'd be bad to take a direct hit.

169
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,899
I have no time!

170
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,819
Okay, just don't blame me later.

171
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,903
I'm ready!

172
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,405
All right, here it comes!

173
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,865
Right!

174
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,203
I told you so.

175
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:33,836
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

{\an8}CHINESE NOODLE RESTAURANT IWATA

177
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,510
So, what's this interesting article?

178
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,678
Oh, this.

179
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,139
{\an8}Hey, the Rookie King Tournament
feature article.

180
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,141
EASTERN JAPAN ROOKIE CHAMPION TOURNAMENT
LINE UP OF FOUR PROSPECTIVE CHAMPS

181
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,436
As expected, Miyata and Hayami
have extensive coverage.

182
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,396
Huh? I don't see Ippo anywhere.

183
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,899
Ippo... is right here!

184
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,816
{\an8}DARK HORSE IPPO MAKUNOUCHI

185
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,359
{\an8}PROBABLY NO.1 IN FEATHERWEIGHT
IN PUNCHING POWER ALONE - MONITORING HIM

186
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,115
{\an8}Is this tiny column pathetic or what?!

187
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,993
{\an8}Fujii-chan said he had high hopes for Ippo

188
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,411
{\an8}but this is downright cold.

189
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,040
You never know.
Maybe this was the best he could do.

190
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,167
At least it's his personal comment.

191
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,669
{\an8}I guess we can't expect much.

192
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,923
{\an8}Ippo is a dark horse.
The odds are a million-to-one against him!

193
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:22,843
He's doing great considering
how far he's come.

194
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,429
He's totally different from
the guy who first walked in.

195
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,223
He had bad luck.

196
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,391
The other three
are way too strong this year.

197
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,978
But still, Ippo's determination
is really something.

198
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,690
I think there's a lot of hope for him
to hit the jackpot.

199
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,943
{\an8}Want to put your money
where your mouth is?

200
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,363
{\an8}All right, I'll put 1,000 yen
on the safe bet, Hayami!

201
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,657
I'll put a whopping 5,000 yen on Miyata.

202
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,409
{\an8}So, Aoki-kun,
you're betting on Ippo, right?

203
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,702
Huh?

204
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:52,414
Whoa, I can't believe you're putting
all your money on a dark horse.

205
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,417
Sure! I'm a natural gambler.

206
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,337
What are you doing?

207
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,965
I'm taking notes
so you can't back out later.

208
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,426
So, what's your bet?

209
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,970
Well, uh...

210
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,722
Come on, spit it out already!

211
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:12,309
Uh, would it be all right
to switch to Miyata?

212
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,020
Unfortunately, Miyata is sold out!

213
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:15,938
<i>No way!</i>

214
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:20,860
{\an8}Well, let's go bug Ippo with this list!

215
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,027
{\an8}You're a devil of a man.

216
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,946
{\an8}Count me in!

217
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:25,990
{\an8}FISHING BOAT RENTAL MAKUNOUCHI

218
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,449
{\an8}Good evening!

219
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,493
Hello!

220
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,787
Oh, hi, everyone.

221
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,997
Hello!

222
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,000
Ippo's Mom, is Ippo in?

223
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,503
Actually, he came down
with a fever after his bath.

224
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,005
Bath?!

225
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,673
Excuse us...

226
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,091
Coming through.

227
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,886
Uh, guys!

228
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:47,970
Are you stupid?!

229
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,140
If you put your swollen body
into a hot bath,

230
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,225
of course you'll come down with a fever!

231
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,394
Yeah, I should've known better.

232
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,022
Silly kid.

233
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,275
Oh, that's right!
I'm glad you're here, Aoki-san!

234
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,653
I was thinking about
the counterpunch timing

235
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,363
and I came up with something.

236
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,489
Can I try it out?

237
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,700
Hey, you want to try it right now?

238
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,785
Don't you have a fever?

239
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,663
I'm not going to be beaten
by a little fever.

240
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,707
Can't we do it tomorrow?

241
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,876
I want to win no matter what!

242
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,711
I don't want to waste even a second!

243
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,504
Uh... sure.

244
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,685
This isn't the right time
to mock him, huh?

245
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,770
Yeah.

246
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,532
The million-to-one odds
might just come up.

247
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,255
Now, the semi-final of the Eastern Japan
Championship Tournament is about to begin!

248
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,257
Fighters at the top of
the featherweight class

249
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,842
are on everybody's lips!

250
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:13,222
Hey, are they airing commentaries
for the semi-finals this year?

251
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,724
Well, Hayami is mighty popular.

252
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,310
-My guess is that's the reason.
-Hmph!

253
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,357
First, Hayami makes
his entrance from the red corner!

254
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,070
As usual, the crowd is deafening!

255
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,161
Ryuichi!

256
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,122
Get him with a KO, okay?

257
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,499
Noisy women!

258
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,293
They'll shut up if Ippo wins.

259
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,211
He'll win all right.

260
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:48,298
He's trained like a madman
this past month.

261
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,717
He'll win for sure.

262
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,762
You were getting a little mad
by the end of it yourself, remember?

263
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,722
Yeah.

264
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,725
Next, Makunouchi enters
from the blue corner!

265
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,726
What's this?

266
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,116
Allow me to introduce these two boxers.

267
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,618
Hayami achieved an amazing
three consecutive wins

268
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,912
in the Interscholastic
Athletic Competition.

269
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,332
Even after turning pro, he has four wins
of four, with four KO's, no losses.

270
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,794
He's the new star hopeful
in the Japan Boxing world!

271
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,254
In the pre-match interview,

272
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,840
he boasted that he would end
the match by KO.

273
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,968
It's understandable, considering
his past record of 100% KO

274
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,554
wins against in-fighters.

275
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,806
Yeah. Great.

276
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,476
Makunouchi in the blue corner

277
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,812
also has four KOs
in four matches, no losses!

278
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,315
He can deliver strong
punches ambidextrously!

279
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,358
If he lands one,
this match will become fun!

280
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,569
Whoa, this guy sounds pretty strong!

281
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,571
A hard puncher, huh?

282
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,698
His family runs
a fishing boat rental business.

283
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,326
He is an energetic high school student
who continues to box

284
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,621
while helping out his mother
who raised him by herself.

285
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,414
"I used to be bullied,

286
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,625
but my life has changed
since I discovered boxing."

287
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,126
Huh?

288
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,005
I like that! Take good care
of your mother, kid!

289
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,092
<i>That idiot!</i>

290
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,135
<i>Write something with more style!</i>

291
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:19,139
We'll be cheering for you.
Kill that womanizer!

292
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,599
Aim for his face!

293
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,434
Watch your mouth, jerk!

294
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,646
Hayami, darling! Knock out
that Momma's boy!

295
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:29,566
Take out that lousy pumpkin head!

296
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,570
The female audience
is completely against you.

297
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,614
It's not like I stirred them up.

298
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,618
I'm curious how many rounds
it'll take Hayami to win this time.

299
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,163
Since he's the hope of Japan,
he needs to win in a convincing way.

300
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,126
<i>They're only interested in
how Hayami will win.</i>

301
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,627
<i>That's expected.</i>

302
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,631
<i>But it's not like
Makunouchi doesn't have a chance.</i>

303
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:56,260
<i>I'm looking forward to finding out
what all those bruises are about.</i>

304
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,930
Listen, kid. If Hayami
finds out what we're up to,

305
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,641
he won't use his short uppercut on you.

306
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,185
You have only one chance to counter.
Remember that!

307
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,436
Yes, sir!

308
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,354
{\an8}ROUND 1 REMAINING TIME

309
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,897
{\an8}Seconds out.

310
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,235
It's no good. Your response time is slow!

311
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,529
Improve, or Mashiba's flicker jabs
will get you!

312
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,614
Okay.

313
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,786
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

314
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,788
<i>The bell is about to ring.</i>

315
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,585
<i>Win, you hear me?!</i>

316
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,302
<i>I have only one chance to counter.</i>

317
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,512
<i>I need to be careful, very careful!</i>

318
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,436
HAYAMI

319
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,151
The opening blow goes to Hayami!

320
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,195
<i>I have to get close to him!</i>

321
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,707
Whoa! It went from absolute silence

322
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,668
to a rush of middle-range punches!
Neither one is yielding!

323
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,670
Hayami-kun, you can do it!

324
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,672
Go, Makunouchi!

325
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,634
Good! The training is showing results!

326
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,801
Good concentration!

327
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,639
<i>I need to study Hayami's moves
and step in deep!</i>

328
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,316
<i>He... He's too fast!</i>

329
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,196
It's Hayami's shotgun!

330
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,198
Has Makunouchi been caught in the fire?!

331
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,201
<i>So, Hayami is superior
in middle-range fighting!</i>

332
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,127
What are you doing?!

333
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,088
Go for it, fishing boat boy!

334
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,925
<i>The speed of his barrage is unbelievable!</i>

335
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,010
<i>I don't have the time
to gauge his movements!</i>

336
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,514
<i>I'll have to charge in expecting
to take a few good hits on the way!</i>

337
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,767
<i>I see.</i>

338
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,730
<i>An ordinary boxer would freak out
if he took punches at this close range.</i>

339
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,525
<i>The number one destructive power
in the tournament, huh?</i>

340
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,526
<i>Cool!</i>

341
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,278
<i>Here he comes!</i>

342
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,196
<i>I'll stand my ground!</i>

343
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,032
<i>If I don't get near him,
I have no chance of winning!</i>

344
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,952
He charged in!

345
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,287
He's prepared for the worst!

346
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,579
We're counting on you, Ippo!

347
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,291
Go! I don't care if you're too aggressive!

348
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,792
Charge in all the way!

349
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,298
<i>Don't stop! Keep going!
Once I get close to him,</i>

350
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,718
<i>he'll throw his in-fighter-killing
left uppercut for sure!</i>

351
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,137
<i>I only have one chance!</i>

352
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,723
<i>I must concentrate on
the movement of his left hand!</i>

353
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,729
<i>When is he going to use it?</i>

354
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,731
<i>When?!</i>

355
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,612
<i>He isn't using his left uppercut!</i>

356
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,365
What?!

357
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,371
<i>Huh?!</i>

358
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,375
<i>As you wish, I'll take your challenge!
Let's in-fight!</i>

359
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,664
<i>In-fight.</i>

360
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,833
<i>An exchange of punches sparked
after closing in.</i>

361
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,086
<i>A fighting style
compiled from past victories.</i>

362
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,839
<i>I thought I never had a chance of winning.</i>

363
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,465
<i>I thought I had a chance.</i>

364
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:49,177
<i>Then he completely crushed me.
He showed me his superiority.</i>

365
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,556
<i>But I can't let it end yet!</i>

366
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,307
<i>I've been entrusted with something.</i>

367
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,433
<i>I can't let it end</i>

368
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,686
<i>in disgrace, with him looking down on me!</i>

369
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,605
<i>Next time, "Forward! Forward!"</i>
