ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,608
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,765
You dummy! Be the turtle!
Keep your guard up!

4
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,810
I'm a turtle!

5
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:56,574
Oh, you idiot! Ippo, up! Get up!

6
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,785
Is that all he's got?

7
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,371
What is this?

8
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,082
He hit me in the middle and...

9
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:10,296
I don't know what happened next!

10
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:16,302
TEARS OF JOY

11
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,494
So, he has a little willpower.

12
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,372
I'm sure Takamura-san
brought him here for a reason.

13
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,541
Why did you lower your guard?

14
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,294
I got hit in the middle
and stopped thinking.

15
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,045
It's count Eight!

16
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,381
Go on! Keep both hands up!

17
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,967
Hey, how come they're using the ring?

18
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,678
Didn't they know we're up for sparring?

19
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,846
Don't ask me.

20
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,640
I heard Takamura-san brought
in some weirdo off the street.

21
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,267
Some weirdo?

22
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,353
There isn't anybody in this world weirder
than Takamura-san.

23
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,646
That's true.

24
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,357
Listen, don't forget. You're a turtle!

25
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,028
No matter what, keep your guard up
'til the end of this round and persevere!

26
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:15,945
Yes, sir!

27
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,656
No matter what,
don't let your guard down, got it?!

28
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,991
Yes, sir!

29
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,213
Good job! Keep your guard up!

30
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,673
Who the heck is that?

31
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,342
Is that an amateur?

32
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,552
Why are you getting excited
over an amateur?

33
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,888
We were scheduled to spar, you know.

34
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,182
Shut up! I reserved the ring!

35
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,351
King Unreasonable is back.

36
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,353
I think the Chief is behind it.

37
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,687
What, really?

38
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:55,318
<i>So, he's blindly following instructions.
They have another thing coming!</i>

39
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,491
Oh, you idiot!

40
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,914
Now for the inevitable nap.

41
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,959
Miyata knows boxing all too well.

42
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,252
Well, shall we begin?

43
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,711
You fool!

44
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,256
Didn't I tell you
not to let your guard down?!

45
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,634
<i>But...</i>

46
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,638
<i>I'm way out of his league.</i>

47
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,724
So, is it over?

48
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,271
You idiot! Don't you
want to become a boxer?!

49
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,483
Or is that all there was
to your commitment?!

50
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,363
What happened to the perseverance
that drove you to grab ten leaves?!

51
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,375
That's right. I decided...

52
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,795
I'm going to be a boxer!

53
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,511
Hey, he got up again.

54
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,888
Yeah. I guess he can take a beating.

55
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,182
Glad you're up!

56
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,144
Your dream would be history
if you didn't show your stuff first!

57
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,812
Anyway, be a turtle!

58
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,481
Keep it up
until the end of the first round!

59
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,442
Fight!

60
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,696
<i>The next one is the third knock-down.
It's all over now.</i>

61
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,825
Dummy! You got caught too easily!

62
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,121
Whoa! Awesome blow on blow!

63
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:33,333
-That's got to hurt.
-Get away! Use your feet! Your feet!

64
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,293
My feet?

65
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,632
What the heck is that?!
Can't you do it with a little more style?

66
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,259
But...

67
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,516
<i>The moment he lets his guard down,
he's through!</i>

68
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,519
<i>I'll never let my guard down!
I have to keep going!</i>

69
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,231
Well, at least he's hanging in there.
He's not letting his guard down.

70
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,567
<i>One more minute till
the end of the first round.</i>

71
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,528
<i>Miyata is underestimating Ippo
and only using his left hand.</i>

72
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,531
<i>As long as he doesn't use his right,
Ippo can tough it out somehow!</i>

73
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,534
So, why can't he knock him down
with that huge barrage?

74
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,995
I guess Miyata's punches
are weaker than I thought.

75
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,122
Damn!

76
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,458
Oh, crap!

77
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,755
It's over.

78
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,222
What the...?!

79
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,724
-You're kidding!
-He took it!

80
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,975
My God.

81
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,024
-He took Miyata's right.
-And he's still standing!

82
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,192
Damn.

83
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,541
I'm saved!

84
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,710
After all that, he managed
to make it through Round One.

85
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,171
And without any experience.
It's hard to believe.

86
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,009
Great job hanging in there, kid.

87
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,219
He's amazing.

88
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,428
Did you see him?

89
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,723
He keeps punching me in the stomach,
going for my face!

90
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,100
It's amazing!

91
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,562
I can't believe he's my age
and can do all that!

92
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,480
It's all in how you look at it.

93
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,443
By the way, how come
you can take a beating like that?

94
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:28,406
Don't tell me it's because
you took punches from bullies every day!

95
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,241
Maybe that's it.

96
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,578
I know these are practice gloves,
but they sure hurt.

97
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,872
My head is still spinning.

98
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,999
Not enough to stop you from talking.

99
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,376
Oh, yeah! I made a huge discovery!

100
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,088
It hurts, but it sure doesn't hurt!

101
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,840
What's that supposed to mean?

102
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,925
I can't explain it.

103
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,177
When I was bullied,

104
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,180
the physical pain didn't hurt as much as
my self-disappointment.

105
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,266
The emotional pain was totally unbearable...

106
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,562
But now, I feel like
I can get back on my feet

107
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,522
no matter how many times I get hit.

108
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,484
<i>I wonder if he got a blow
to the wrong place.</i>

109
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,862
So, have your feet been affected?
Can you still move them normally?

110
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,323
Uh, yes, I think so.

111
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,910
Good. You'll start taking
the offensive in the second round.

112
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,954
What? But I've never tried to hit anyone.

113
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,040
I wouldn't know what to do!

114
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,751
You idiot! I already taught you how!

115
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,003
Oh, the jab!

116
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:28,341
Right, now listen. You can't catch Miyata
by scrambling around.

117
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,051
Slide toward him, and corner him.

118
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,010
Right!

119
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,471
You already know your range, right?

120
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,014
Like grabbing those leaves!

121
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:35,932
Uh, yes!

122
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,808
-Use your right if you can, too!
-Right!

123
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,562
Miyata, what are you doing?
It's already the second round.

124
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,939
Are you holding back?

125
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,107
Don't let that amateur
play with you too much.

126
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,193
He isn't even trying to punch you.

127
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,362
He's like a sandbag.

128
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,447
You don't need to tell me.

129
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,158
<i>This is humiliating.</i>

130
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,536
<i>Still, Takamura-san is his cornerman.</i>

131
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,538
<i>Who knows what he's telling him?</i>

132
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,339
Oh, he's taken a fighting pose.

133
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:14,136
Let's see. Elbows tight at the sides,
fists at eye level.

134
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,390
What's he mumbling about?

135
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,642
Hey, he's starting to look like a boxer.

136
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,644
It's just a bluff.

137
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,687
<i>We'll see about that.</i>

138
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,858
<i>I'm still too far away to grab a leaf.</i>

139
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,362
<i>Not yet.</i>

140
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,115
<i>Just a little more.</i>

141
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,576
<i>Let's see what he's got.</i>

142
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,703
<i>He's in range!</i>

143
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,250
Whoa, he jabbed!

144
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,459
<i>What a jab!</i>

145
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,839
<i>He's fast! I thought he was an amateur!</i>

146
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,301
-The klutz ain't too shabby!
-He's pretty fast too.

147
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,597
<i>Those are some good jabs,
but this won't last forever.</i>

148
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,684
-Now! Right jab!
-Right!

149
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,567
What the heck?
Can't he do anything but jab?

150
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,860
Ow!

151
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,655
What's with that wipeout?!
I taught you the straight punch, remember?

152
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,366
-Huh?
-Did you forget?

153
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,578
Think back to when you first punched
a sandbag in this gym!

154
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,921
Um, I think it was important
to step in deep and twist the hip.

155
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,133
The shoulder is supposed
to turn inward, just like jabbing...

156
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,469
He's doing it again.

157
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,389
<i>I'll admit you've got pretty sharp jabs,</i>

158
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,600
<i>but I'm afraid I can't let you hit me.</i>

159
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,852
Miyata's good.

160
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,021
Takamura-san looks amazed.

161
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,024
Technically, Miyata ranks
over non-licensed boxers.

162
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,318
Maybe he's afraid of
seeing someone better than him.

163
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:58,491
He's getting short of breath.
We'll see who can endure longer.

164
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,995
<i>My arms are getting heavy!</i>

165
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,332
<i>His arms are probably getting tired.</i>

166
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,335
<i>My arms are dead heavy!</i>

167
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,170
<i>Just a little longer.</i>

168
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,341
My turn.

169
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:20,096
My arms may be dead heavy,
but I can't stop now!

170
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,852
Now!

171
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,271
Foot! Hip!

172
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,273
Shoulder!

173
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,069
-What the...?!
-His guard!

174
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,321
-It's knocked away!
-He's wide open!

175
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,532
Go!

176
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,367
One more punch!

177
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:49,792
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

178
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,005
-His guard!
-He's wide open!

179
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,216
Go!

180
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,510
One more punch!

181
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,401
-So close!
-If only that got in!

182
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,237
-His punches are pretty strong.
-This guy isn't bad!

183
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,739
-I would've done it.
-That was so close.

184
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,367
You're pretty good
with both your left and right fists.

185
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,286
Thanks.

186
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,121
Don't get pleased with yourself!

187
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,999
Recite everything I've taught you so far.

188
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:35,880
Um, the left jab, guard,
sliding footwork, and the right straight.

189
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,924
Good! We're going to use
all of those in the next round.

190
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,928
Keep your guard up, approach him,
and hit left, then right!

191
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:43,929
Understand?!

192
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,057
Uh, right! Left, then right.

193
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,311
It's amazing he made it
to the third round.

194
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,563
Which will prove superior?

195
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,565
The rookie's right punch
or Miyata's skill?

196
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:58,319
This actually might be something to see!

197
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,905
<i>It's not going to be that easy.</i>

198
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:05,326
<i>Ippo may appear to be on higher ground,
but he hasn't hit Miyata once!</i>

199
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,829
<i>The right straight punch
at the end of Round Two</i>

200
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,581
<i>was the chance of a lifetime.</i>

201
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,833
<i>It's a shame he didn't pull it off.</i>

202
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,086
<i>Miyata won't make the same mistake again.</i>

203
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,006
<i>What's worse is he's all fired up now.</i>

204
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,842
<i>He'll be giving it his all
in the next round.</i>

205
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,471
It would have been interesting
if the amateur's right had hit Miyata.

206
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,724
He may not be as powerful as we thought.

207
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,352
Maybe he's afraid
of the kid's right punch.

208
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,479
<i>They're clueless.</i>

209
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:37,358
<i>If they think boxing is about power,
they're gravely mistaken.</i>

210
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,319
<i>What's important is the right timing</i>

211
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,364
<i>and skill to pinpoint
an opponent's weakness.</i>

212
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,494
Keep my guard up, left then right!

213
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,456
<i>Left, right!</i>

214
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,709
<i>Left, right!</i>

215
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,462
<i>This time he's doing the one-two!
I'm impressed!</i>

216
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,093
Hey, he's good!
Hard to believe he's an amateur.

217
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,470
The great Miyata is in defensive mode.

218
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,306
<i>Miyata's being way too quiet.</i>

219
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,225
<i>Is he waiting for something?</i>

220
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,397
<i>You definitely have incredible power.
But remember this. In boxing you can also...</i>

221
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,776
<i>knock down your opponent like this!</i>

222
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,209
<i>So, he was going for the chin.</i>

223
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,798
When you take one on the chin,
your brain sloshes about your skull,

224
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,884
causing temporary functional impairment.

225
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,218
What is this?

226
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,722
But what a brilliantly aimed punch!

227
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,223
It's probably over now.

228
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,726
<i>He got us. What a guy!</i>

229
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,316
<i>He may be fully conscious,
but his body won't do what he tells it.</i>

230
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,984
<i>He won't be able to stand up.</i>

231
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,367
Hey, do what I tell you to!

232
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,670
-He got up!
-You got to be kidding!

233
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,840
How come a total amateur can get up
after getting his chin crushed?!

234
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,348
<i>How are you standing?</i>

235
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,518
Left, right.

236
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,314
Ippo!

237
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,945
<i>That did it.</i>

238
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,368
Ippo, get up!

239
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,875
<i>Impossible!</i>

240
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,002
<i>I won't let it end!</i>

241
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,882
<i>I made a commitment to become a boxer!</i>

242
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,009
One more fall and it's over.

243
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,178
There isn't much time left.
Hang in there, Ippo!

244
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,388
Right!

245
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,144
-Amazing.
-His punches are still going strong.

246
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:32,074
Ugh, I can't bear to watch.
His face is getting deformed.

247
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:36,036
How can he keep punching
in that condition?

248
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,163
He shouldn't be able to stand!

249
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,917
<i>The only thing keeping him going
is his determination to become a boxer.</i>

250
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,170
<i>That's how he's withstanding
Miyata's punches.</i>

251
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,136
I won't fall down. I won't!

252
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,681
I'm going to be a new person!
I'm going to be a boxer!

253
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,474
What an amazing kid!

254
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,686
He forced down his spastic legs
and fought back!

255
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,690
<i>Why? Why aren't you falling down?</i>

256
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,942
<i>This is insulting!</i>

257
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,696
<i>It's like everything I know about boxing
is being debunked!</i>

258
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,908
Left... right.

259
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,455
<i>Fall down!</i>

260
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,339
<i>I did it!</i>

261
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,601
You bastard! Down! Fall down!

262
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,359
Left... right... left!

263
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,864
-Right!
-You're pissing me off!

264
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,115
Look out, Ippo!

265
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,618
Don't do it! He'll throw a counterpunch!

266
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:13,133
I'm going to be a boxer.

267
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,643
Hey, Ippo!

268
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,730
Hey, Ippo! Ippo!

269
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,947
Oh, man. He's out cold.

270
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,704
Someone bring a bucket of water!

271
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,957
-Uh, right!
-I'll come with you!

272
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,167
Hey, old man! Were you watching?

273
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,210
Old man?

274
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,799
The kid has a lot of grit.

275
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,761
Gritty boxers aren't in style nowadays.

276
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:04,893
However, the greats, like Harata,
Ebihara, Obao, and Washima...

277
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,481
Those famous boxers got up again and
again every time they were knocked down.

278
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,776
And every time they did, we were inspired.

279
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,780
Old man! So that's where you're hiding.

280
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,782
You watched it till the very end, I hope!

281
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,243
So, you think he isn't cut out for it?

282
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,288
Whose eyes are blind? Mine or yours?!

283
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:29,751
That's some sloppy mess
you brought into my gym, boy.

284
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,213
I haven't seen many guys who'd put up
such a fight

285
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,465
in a mere sparring session.

286
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,511
Tell him to come here
every day starting tomorrow!

287
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,221
I'll make a boxer out of him.

288
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,061
He sure gave you
a hard time though, Miyata.

289
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,480
And you used a counterpunch on him.

290
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,650
Don't you think that's bullying, much?

291
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,112
<i>I wasn't bullying anybody.</i>

292
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,699
<i>He was wearing the same 16-ounce gloves.</i>

293
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,118
<i>But look at these arms that blocked
those punches.</i>

294
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,875
<i>Boxing has just become
incredibly interesting to me.</i>

295
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,881
Hey, are you awake now?

296
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:27,559
Oh, yeah. I lost.

297
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,605
I lost without getting even one punch in.

298
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,524
You really showed a lot of grit!

299
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,487
-Nice fight!
-You were amazing!

300
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,490
Keep it up! You'll be coming here
starting tomorrow, right?

301
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,992
The name's Kimura. Nice to meet you.

302
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,285
I'm Aoki.

303
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,747
You've got good punches,
but your defense needs work.

304
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,416
I'll put you through
the mill starting tomorrow.

305
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,712
You're in no position to talk
about someone else's defense!

306
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:59,967
That's mean. I was all ready
to train the new guy!

307
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,428
Huh? New guy?

308
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:08,016
The Chief says you passed.
He wants you here starting tomorrow.

309
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,520
That's great news, kid!
Hey, guys! I'll re-introduce him.

312
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,281
-Hey, say something.
-Oh, right!

313
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:28,870
How do you do? I'm Ippo Makunouchi.

314
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,414
Starting today, I've...

315
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:35,043
I've been accepted into this gym...

316
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:41,008
Into this gym as an apprentice.

317
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,472
