ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,608
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,439
He's great.

4
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:01,204
<i>Incredible! That counterpunch
is impossible to survive!</i>

5
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,627
<i>Three months.</i>

6
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:13,633
THREE MONTHS TO COUNTER

7
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,846
I do this, and this, and that!

8
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,014
Guess not.

9
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,601
-Oh, Kimura-san!
-What's up?

10
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,103
I'm practicing shadowing.

11
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,646
Could you give me pointers?

12
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,982
We have roadwork now. Maybe later.

13
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,775
It won't take long!

14
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,278
It goes like this, and then this, right?

15
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,281
Then if I do this, this happens.

16
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,409
At which point I try this,
but it comes back at me like this.

17
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,368
But in the end...

18
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,622
This doesn't work, and that doesn't work.
I'm at an impasse.

19
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,999
Kimura-san, if you were me...

20
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,674
Now that's pulling a punch!

21
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:59,387
I thought you were looking more decent,
but I guess you have a long way to go.

22
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,391
-That's mean, out of the blue!
-You should have dodged it!

23
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,688
Hey! How long do you plan
on sitting on me?

24
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,608
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.

25
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,444
-I'll be on the road too.
-Sure.

26
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,793
Chief, if I chase him too far,
Miyata-kun's counter comes back at me.

27
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,545
How should I deal with it?

28
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,548
What do you think you should do?

29
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,133
I've been thinking, but...

30
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,970
I see. There's only one thing
you can do right now.

31
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,057
-Get into the ring!
-Uh, right!

32
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,104
Pretend you're Miyata and watch me!

33
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,314
What?

34
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,616
Oh, I get it! Now I understand!

35
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,956
Well? Were you able
to throw a counterpunch?

36
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,501
A counterpunch takes advantage
of your opponent's power,

37
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,587
so if I don't jump in,
he won't be able to counter!

38
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,465
That's right. Irritate him
by making him wait,

39
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,010
and when Miyata can't wait any longer
and comes a-punching, you're in luck!

40
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,932
Use all your power
and finish him with an uppercut!

41
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,725
With an uppercut?

42
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,270
-Yes. We'll call it...
-Yes?

43
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,438
Operation Tease!

44
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,232
Operation Tease?!

45
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,609
That's kind of tacky.

46
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,236
Oh, shut up!

47
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,447
It's because this is the only thing
you can do right now, idiot!

48
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,701
I want to plan a more stylish operation
too, you know!

49
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,121
-Make the punches more compact!
-Right!

50
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,505
That's it. Good.
You're getting much better.

51
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,217
Let's take a little break.

52
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,219
Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

53
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,144
<i>I wonder who this is?</i>

54
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,654
What?

55
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,658
Uh, what?

56
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,036
-You're already here.
-Huh?

57
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,496
Going well, Ichiro?

58
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,415
Yeah. Everything's fine, Dad.

59
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,918
Kid, how long are you going to rest?!

60
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,795
-Let's get to it!
-Right!

61
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,049
<i>So, that's his dad.</i>

62
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,558
<i>Operation Tease, huh?</i>

63
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,520
<i>There isn't much else I can do.</i>

64
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,565
<i>Miyata-kun has been boxing forever.</i>

65
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,026
<i>I can't catch up with him right away.</i>

66
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:09,202
-Ippo, could you set the table?
-Sure!

67
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,509
-Use your feet!
-Right!

68
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,095
Come on, more! What's wrong with you?!

69
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,972
If you stop your punches
after stepping in, you'll get countered!

70
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,057
Right!

71
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,187
All right. Next, hit the sandbag.

72
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,523
When you're done,
we'll do more mitt-punching!

73
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,316
Right.

74
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,905
He's improved a lot, don't you think?

75
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:51,077
Yeah. He's so obedient,
he absorbs information quickly.

76
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,582
He's got potential.

77
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,085
The kid.

78
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:07,969
He certainly has potential,
but he has a long way to go.

79
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,930
By the way,
how's Ichiro-kun getting along?

80
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:16,102
He started to practice a lot more lately.
He seems abnormally motivated.

81
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,728
Is that so?

82
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,900
Did you use him to motivate my son?

83
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,861
What are you talking about?

84
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,405
Oh, nothing. Your ideas
are normally good ones.

85
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,077
I just want them both
to mature into good boxers.

86
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,871
Thank you.

87
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,003
-All right, kid! Time for mitt-punching!
-Uh, right!

88
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,840
Can't you make them more compact?!

89
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,055
All right, that's it for today!
You may go.

90
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,933
Thank you very much!

91
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,771
The Chief is so tough!

92
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,028
It's exhausting being that kid's partner.

93
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,331
Ugh. I can't raise my arms.

94
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,583
Hey, Ippo!

95
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,086
That old man really worked you hard,
didn't he! Are you all right?

96
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,339
Takamura-san.

97
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,091
What's that you got around your waist?

98
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,259
Huh?

99
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,887
Uh, it's a towel.

100
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,139
Doh, I know that.

101
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,184
I want to know why you're wearing it.

102
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,854
Listen. When you take a shower,
let it all hang out, got it?

103
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,649
That's what being a man
is all about. Right, guys?

104
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,901
What are you doing?!

105
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,653
I'm taking it off, of course.

106
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,654
But...

107
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,448
Embarrassed you're tiny?

108
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,743
Don't worry. Size doesn't make a man!

109
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,464
That was cruel! That was so cruel!

110
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,467
Aw, get over it! I meant no harm.

111
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:16,097
How can you say that?
I'll never shower with you again.

112
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,809
I'll treat you to a bowl of ramen
sometime, so let's forgive and forget!

113
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,311
Anyway, setting that aside...

114
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,604
Don't change the subject!

115
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,942
This is serious. You need
to buy a pair of boxing shoes.

116
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:28,859
What?

117
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,654
The soles of your shoes are worn out,
they're dangerous.

118
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,155
Oh.

119
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,505
OHTA SPORTING GOODS

120
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,300
Vantage...

121
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,218
Hello!

122
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,179
Um, I need a pair of boxing shoes.

123
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,432
What brand are you looking for?

124
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,935
Huh? What brand? Uh...

125
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,896
How do you like this pair?

126
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,609
They're best sellers right now.
Everyone buys these!

127
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,985
Whoa. They're expensive!

128
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,279
The more expensive, the better they are.

129
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,238
Oh.

130
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,992
-See? Aren't they unbelievably light?
-Hey, you're right.

131
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,745
-But they're very sturdy as well.
-Oh, really?

132
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:24,123
Plus, there are many colors
to choose from. See? Look at them all!

133
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,625
Everyone buys them.

134
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,502
They're a little pricey,
but they pay for themselves.

135
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,630
That's true.

136
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,591
If they're best sellers,
I guess I can't go wrong.

137
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,635
-I'll take them.
-Wise choice!

138
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,012
-Hold on.
-Miyata-kun!

139
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,181
You're an in-fighter, aren't you?!

140
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,893
Why are you buying leather-sole shoes
for out-boxers?

141
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,646
A rubber sole with traction
is better for an in-fighter.

142
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,482
-What's your size?
-Seven and a half.

143
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,525
Okay, how about these?

144
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,278
They're light and easier on the wallet.

145
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,823
Wow. Yeah! I'll take these!

146
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,784
I've changed my mind! I'll take these!

147
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,578
Uh, thanks for your business.

148
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,664
Miyata-kun, thanks! Huh?

149
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,666
Miyata-kun?

150
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,547
Miyata-kun!

151
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,427
Miyata-kun, wait up!

152
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,304
Miyata-kun!

153
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,775
Miyata-kun, to thank you for helping
with my shoes, can I treat you to a juice?

154
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,485
No.

155
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,739
Miyata-kun!

156
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,742
Come on, stop, Miyata-kun! Please wait!

157
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,870
All right, I'll take your juice!

158
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,873
Stop shouting out my name.
It's embarrassing!

159
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,251
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:59,051
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

161
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,811
What?

162
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:13,232
Your father is teaching you boxing, right?

163
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,608
I envy you.

164
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,651
Is that sarcasm?

165
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:20,823
Not at all! I'm jealous
because I don't have a father.

166
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,327
Huh. He's just strict.

167
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,997
Did you hear about my father
from Takamura-san and the others?

168
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,416
Yeah! They said he used to be
an amazing boxer.

169
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,670
So, how long have you
been taking lessons from your dad?

170
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,505
Do you have any tips for defense?

171
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,550
What kind of training is good
for improving footwork?

172
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,386
What's it like taking lessons
from your own dad? Is it fun?!

173
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,141
You're a weird guy.

174
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,352
Lots of people have teased me
about my relationship with my father,

175
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,813
but you're the first one
who's been envious.

176
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,482
But he was strong, wasn't he?

177
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:03,782
Yeah. He made up for what he lacked
in power with agile and brilliant moves.

178
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:09,038
<i>He used to evade his opponent's
attacks just like a bullfighter.</i>

179
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,550
<i>I'm going to be strong just like you, Dad!</i>

180
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:30,017
He must have been
strong just like you, Miyata-kun.

181
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,479
He was so strong, he could beat me
with one hand tied behind his back.

182
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,065
Wow! I wish I could have seen him fight.

183
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:41,070
However, during the final round
of the Eastern Pacific Title Match...

184
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:47,910
his opponent's one lucky punch
crushed his chin.

185
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,454
His chin got crushed?

186
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>Ultimately, power dominates skill.</i>

187
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,462
<i>Without powerful punches,
a boxer can't become a champion.</i>

188
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,925
<i>He could have gone back
to boxing after the injury healed.</i>

189
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,221
<i>But he never climbed back into the ring.</i>

190
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,431
<i>His conviction had been crushed.</i>

191
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,727
<i>No, you're wrong. Dad, you're awesome!</i>

192
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,355
<i>There's nothing wrong with
your style of boxing!</i>

193
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,357
<i>I'll prove it.</i>

194
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,236
<i>I'll prove that your style
of boxing is not wrong!</i>

195
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,116
My father's boxing was not wrong.

196
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,287
I just needed to compensate
for the lack of power.

197
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,915
I practiced every single day
until I felt like a rag doll,

198
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,751
until I finally achieved it.

199
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,130
My... counterpunch.

200
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,762
No matter who my opponent is,
I'll face him fair and square,

201
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,681
and I will rise to the top!

202
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,895
I will overcome the wall that my father
couldn't overcome, not just for his sake,

203
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,521
but for my own sake!

204
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,650
If you're going to rely on power,
I'll face you head-on.

205
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,153
I'll be ready to knock you down
in the first round.

206
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:14,538
<i>I had no idea that kind of sentiment
was behind Miyata-kun's counterpunch.</i>

207
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:20,044
{\an8}What?! You want to
step forward and fight?!

208
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:24,548
Kid, do you knowingly want to
fall victim to that counterpunch?!

209
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,509
I don't want to run
from Miyata-kun's counterpunch!

210
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,012
I want to face him head-on!

211
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,766
I'll practice even harder,
so please let me do it!

212
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,102
-Are you serious?
-Of course, sir!

213
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,397
Please, Chief!

214
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,446
Very well. If you insist,
I'll give you a killer crash course!

215
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,490
We need to improve your dart-and-dash.

216
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:53,786
Get ready for roadwork.
I don't want to hear any whining!

217
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,787
Yes, sir!

218
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:02,002
<i>So, he wants to face him
head-on without running away, eh?</i>

219
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,089
<i>Damn, the kid makes me happy!</i>

220
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,006
Let's do it!

221
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,972
Run! Improve the speed
of your dart-and-dash!

222
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,307
This is faster than usual!

223
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,476
Ram into Miyata's counter!

224
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,104
Jump forward before he extends
his arm completely!

225
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,314
That'll halve the destructive power!

226
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,066
That's why you need a powerful dart!

227
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,192
Yes, sir!

228
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,986
-We're doing five sets!
-What?!

229
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,612
Next, we dart uphill!

230
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,739
-Right!
-Five sets of this too!

231
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,120
Time for mitt-punching!

232
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,831
Come on, give me short punches!
Don't rest!

233
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,207
Right!

234
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,711
Don't give your opponent enough time
to punch back!

235
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,628
Yes, sir!

236
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,757
You idiot! You should withstand
at least this much!

237
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:53,512
You're the one who wanted
to fight him head-on, remember?!

238
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:58,267
But I never imagined
it would be this gruesome!

239
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,271
-Thought I'd lend a hand.
-You're in the way.

240
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,663
Really, Takamura-san?

241
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:25,419
<i>I'm at my limit. I feel
like I'm going to die at this rate.</i>

242
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,672
The old man is really
putting him through the wringer.

243
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,551
Don't sigh. Cheer up.

244
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,846
All right! Let's go have that ramen
I told you about the other day!

245
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,390
A full stomach will perk you up!

246
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,684
Oh... ramen?

247
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,852
CHINESE NOODLES IWATA

248
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,897
Welcome! What's this? You're all together?

249
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,400
Hey, it's Aoki-san!

250
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,569
Aoki works here part-time.

251
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,947
Even a pro boxer can't make a living
off six-round level boxing.

252
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,082
Delicious!

253
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,919
It's a mystery to me how a sloppy palooka
like you can make such delicious noodles!

254
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,962
Don't be so mean.

255
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:13,133
My dream is to make enough money
off boxing to have my own restaurant.

256
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,843
Hey! Come on, let me finish it all!

257
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,846
Oh, no! You have to start dieting soon!

258
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,348
All the more reason to eat now!

259
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,018
You can't eat anything during a diet?

260
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,981
Yeah. I'm tall,
so it takes a while to lose weight.

261
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,027
Anything liquid puts weight on me.

262
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,196
I need to watch out on a routine basis.

263
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,617
That means I can't shower, either.
Parched skin absorbs water.

264
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,993
You can't even shower?

265
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,747
You won't be subjected to
shower room hijinks for a while.

266
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,877
Once the fight is won,
all the hardships seem like child's play!

267
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,171
You'll understand once you beat Miyata.

268
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,840
That's if you win.

269
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,345
Well, I have to get going.

270
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,430
Okay! I'll make it my treat this time.

271
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,974
Oh, thanks!

272
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,351
I wasn't talking about you.

273
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,645
Thank you. It was very delicious!

274
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,565
Bye! We'll hang out here a little longer.

275
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,317
-See you!
-Goodbye!

276
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,865
<i>Everyone has their own story
behind boxing.</i>

277
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,162
<i>They all have their own hardships,
but they don't show it at all.</i>

278
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,248
<i>I need to follow their example!</i>

279
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,669
<i>But...</i>

280
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:39,511
<i>I realize I'm the one who started it,
but I can't keep up this pace.</i>

281
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,941
Miyata-kun.

282
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,237
I practiced every single day
until I felt like a rag doll.

283
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,633
When in close proximity,
you can't use long punches.

284
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:22,179
Use only short punches!
Make them short, frequent, and quick!

285
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,183
-Keep focused!
-Right!

286
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:30,062
Hey, Ippo! How's the training
coming along?

287
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,897
What?

288
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,815
-Goodbye!
-Huh? What?

289
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,576
Damn it!

290
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,305
{\an8}Welcome home! Dinner is ready.

291
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,230
Uh, bless this food! Huh?

292
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,275
Mom, I'm home! Uh, no! Dinner was great!

293
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,986
You silly boy.

294
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,705
Good!

295
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,917
Good!

296
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,381
Okay, take a break!

297
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,390
I've been using padded mitts,
and look at me.

298
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,267
It's been almost three months.

299
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,020
I'm impressed
he's hung in there this long.

300
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,654
Ippo is putting in a lot of spirit.

301
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,157
Yeah, because he's sparring
with Miyata tomorrow.

302
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,284
So, the time has finally come.

303
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,872
<i>Tomorrow! Head-on, fair and square!</i>

304
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,499
<i>Knock-down.</i>

305
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,751
<i>Unless you get to your feet,
the match is over.</i>

306
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,838
<i>An unbelievable knock-down.</i>

307
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,506
<i>An incredibly forceful knock-down.</i>

308
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,175
<i>A spirit-breaking knock-down!</i>

309
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,846
<i>If I don't want it to end, I must get up.</i>

310
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,974
<i>If I want it to continue, I must get up!</i>

311
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:58,311
<i>And once I'm up,
I must find out how much I've matured!</i>

312
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,606
<i>Next time, "The Opening Bell
of the Rematch."</i>
