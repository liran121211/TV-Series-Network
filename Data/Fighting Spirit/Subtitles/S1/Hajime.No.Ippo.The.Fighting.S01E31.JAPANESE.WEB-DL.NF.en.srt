00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,291
Why is the article a reject, sir?

5
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,791
It just is!

6
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:29,625
I've told you countless times the readers
don't like dry articles like this!

7
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,083
Write it over immediately.
I want it by today!

THE PLUSES AND MINUSES
OF THE BOXING WORLD, 1ST DRAFT

9
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,750
Oh, brother.

10
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:39,833
<i>I see.</i>

11
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,833
<i>The All-Japan Rookie Match
is the day after tomorrow.</i>

12
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,208
<i>The Featherweight class
is receiving lots of attention.</i>

13
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,958
<i>Word of mouth is mostly in Sendo's favor.</i>

14
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,916
<i>If the injured fist from the Mashiba
vs. Makunouchi fight recovers,</i>

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,125
<i>I think it will be
an interesting match, but...</i>

16
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:58,875
<i>But to think that he made it
all the way to the All-Japan!</i>

TRACES OF INTENSE BATTLES

18
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,375
<i>After his professional debut,
he won the two preliminaries by KO.</i>

19
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:11,791
<i>Off to a good start,
Makunouchi proceeded to tackle</i>

20
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,208
<i>the Eastern Japan
Rookie Championship Tournament.</i>

21
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,375
<i>His first opponent was
a black boxer named Ozuma,</i>

22
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:21,416
<i>whose specialty is fierce hooks
from either side.</i>

23
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,375
<i>For Makunouchi, a close-range fighter,</i>

24
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,333
<i>he was a tough customer to deal with.</i>

25
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,500
<i>He's getting faster!
I don't have a chance to hit back!</i>

26
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,541
<i>Their battle turned into
a feverish knock-down battle.</i>

27
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:43,291
<i>The fight was so close,
either could have won.</i>

28
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:51,958
Right there!

29
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,666
<i>This is it! This is the hook!</i>

30
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,375
<i>I can't dodge it!</i>

31
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,958
<i>I've got to stop it
before the barrage starts!</i>

32
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,083
<i>It didn't hurt! It didn't...</i>

33
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,750
<i>I still don't feel a...</i>

34
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,375
<i>Take this!</i>

35
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,375
<i>Oh, no! I over-swung and lost my balance!</i>

36
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,458
Ippo was overpowered
in the exchange of punches!

37
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,500
He's finally at his limit.

38
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,291
Kid! Now it's do-or-die!

39
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,500
Use willpower, and keep punching back!

40
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,458
<i>Damn!</i>

41
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,208
Ippo!

42
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:26,916
<i>I have to win!</i>

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,625
<i>I promised Mama-san and the guys!
I have to win!</i>

44
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,250
-Lash out, Ippo!
-It's no good. He's completely trapped!

45
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,125
Oh, shit!

46
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,166
<i>This is the end.</i>

47
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,416
<i>This is the end for you, Makunouchi!</i>

48
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,791
<i>It's a direct hit! Victory is mine!</i>

49
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,916
<i>The fight was finally won
by the dodge hook</i>

50
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,250
<i>and launch barrage maneuver</i>

51
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,416
<i>that he acquired
through intensive training.</i>

52
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,625
<i>And so, Ippo Makunouchi
cleared the first round</i>

53
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,375
<i>of the Eastern Japan Rookie
Championship Tournament.</i>

54
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,916
<i>I... I did it.</i>

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,541
<i>His second round opponent was Kobashi.</i>

56
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,291
<i>He is by no means
a boxer with spectacular technique,</i>

57
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,583
<i>however, he studied Makunouchi</i>

58
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,541
<i>and pinpointed his weak points.</i>

59
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,125
You look really tired.

60
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:21,916
But if he makes it to the final round,
you won't win by decision.

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,291
Just as Kobashi planned it.

62
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:27,083
That's not acceptable!
I'll do it, you'll see!

63
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,708
I won't give up until it's over!

64
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,166
<i>He has nerves of steel!</i>

65
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,333
<i>He should have run out of power ages ago!</i>

66
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,708
<i>Fall!</i>

67
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,625
<i>I did it! He's going to fall!</i>

68
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:52,875
<i>Body blow!</i>

69
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,000
<i>As long as I have strength,
I'll keep punching!</i>

70
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,416
<i>Take this!</i>

71
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,375
<i>He's swinging wide!</i>

72
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,000
<i>Overpowered by points,</i>

73
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,583
<i>and at the brink of losing
by judges' decision,</i>

74
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,166
<i>Makunouchi won seconds from</i>

75
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,666
<i>the end of the 4th round
with a KO reversal.</i>

76
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,666
<i>His inexperience stood out
like a sore thumb,</i>

77
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,833
<i>but in the end he was able to show
his fearsome punching power.</i>

78
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:50,333
<i>Then came the Eastern Japan Rookie
Championship Tournament Semi-Final.</i>

79
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:55,208
<i>He was up against
the MVP candidate, Ryuichi Hayami.</i>

80
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,416
<i>With his deadly punch called the Shotgun,</i>

81
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,666
<i>quick moves, and perfected techniques,</i>

82
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,250
<i>Makunouchi's odds of victory
were near zero in everyone's eyes.</i>

83
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,000
<i>What incredible strength!</i>

84
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,125
<i>This guy is a true prodigy.</i>

85
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,666
{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

86
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,458
{\an8}What?! You want to learn
how to counterpunch?

87
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,458
Please, sir!

88
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,791
You fool. That is a highly advanced skill!

89
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,583
What if I know what punch is coming next?

90
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,791
What did you say?

91
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,416
There is a certain punch
I know he's going to use on me!

92
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,833
<i>However, Makunouchi didn't give up.</i>

93
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,875
<i>He planned his counterattack
and fought until the bitter end.</i>

94
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,583
<i>I have to synchronize my right hook!</i>

95
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,583
<i>What?! A counterpunch?</i>

96
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,333
<i>Go!</i>

97
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,083
<i>I'll get you first!</i>

98
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:22,708
<i>I can't afford to lose
on a small stage like this!</i>

99
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,125
<i>I'm going to steamroller you!</i>

100
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,750
<i>The match proceeded under
Hayami's overwhelming advantage,</i>

101
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:35,041
<i>but ultimately, it evolved
into exchanging punches.</i>

102
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,375
<i>And then...</i>

103
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,458
<i>Hayami sank into the mat.</i>

104
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,708
<i>It was Makunouchi's victory,
unpredicted by anyone.</i>

105
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,041
<i>He had finally advanced to the final match</i>

106
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,083
<i>of the Eastern Japan Rookie
Championship Tournament.</i>

107
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,916
I... I did it.

108
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,791
I won.

109
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,500
All right!

110
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:33,000
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

111
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,083
<i>Makunouchi was now a finalist,
and the other semi-final</i>

112
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,625
<i>would determine the other finalist.</i>

113
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,625
<i>The other fighters were Miyata,</i>

114
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,833
<i>who had a promise to keep with Makunouchi,</i>

115
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,750
<i>and Mashiba, who slaughtered
his competition with flicker jabs</i>

116
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,208
<i>and merciless fighting.</i>

117
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,833
What a heartwarming father-son scene.

118
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,625
Are you going to run to Daddy
for comfort when you lose?

119
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:04,833
Comfort from a second-class boxer,
who failed to become a champion.

120
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,041
Don't be so hasty.
We'll settle this tomorrow.

121
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,166
He's so far away!

122
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,375
His punch is so long and fast,
it's confusing Miyata.

123
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,625
This time, Miyata is stumped.

124
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,000
What?!

125
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,583
Now he's assuming the hitman style!

126
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,625
<i>This is an insult.</i>

127
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,958
<i>Shoulder-block!</i>

128
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,666
<i>Too slow!</i>

129
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,041
<i>It was a high-level fight,</i>

130
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,291
<i>but Miyata led the match
by a slight advantage.</i>

131
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,125
<i>His counter hit home,</i>

132
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,291
<i>and at the very moment
he was about to take the match</i>...

133
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,791
<i>He's open for a counterpunch!</i>

134
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,791
This is bad!

135
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,833
It hit his face!

136
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,583
<i>Was it accidental or intentional?</i>

137
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,041
<i>His balance upset by
Mashiba stepping on his foot,</i>

138
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,916
<i>Miyata fell victim to
Mashiba's rush attack.</i>

139
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,333
<i>Miyata suffered a knockdown. However...</i>

140
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,166
<i>Who the hell is this guy?!</i>

141
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,166
<i>Isn't he just a spoiled brat
who always sucks up to Daddy?!</i>

142
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,916
<i>How can he take this much abuse?!</i>

143
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,916
<i>I must win.</i>

144
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>Miyata fought desperately,
beaten to a pulp all the way.</i>

145
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,750
<i>His fighting spirit was so powerful,
it made even Mashiba recoil in fear.</i>

146
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,875
<i>In the end, however,
that awesome fighting spirit gave out.</i>

147
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:20,958
<i>Counterpunch!</i>

148
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,375
The timing is bang-on!

149
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,458
It's going to connect!

150
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,375
<i>Miyata was defeated.</i>

151
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:45,541
<i>To Makunouchi, who had fought
his way to the top with Miyata as a goal,</i>

152
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,583
<i>it signified losing his objective.</i>

153
00:13:55,791 --> 00:14:00,166
<i>However, Mashiba is not merely
a boxer who resorts to dirty tricks.</i>

154
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,583
<i>He is a boxer with true ability.
Master of the hard-to-dodge flicker jab,</i>

155
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,000
<i>with a finishing move
consisting of a sharp chopping right.</i>

156
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,458
<i>His one and only blood relative
is a younger sister.</i>

157
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:16,333
<i>Mashiba's hunger for success
is the source of his power.</i>

158
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:21,250
If I become World Champion,
I'll make a fortune.

159
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:25,208
When that happens,
how do you think they'll see us?

160
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,291
I can't wait.

EASTERN JAPAN ROOKIE CHAMPIONSHIP

162
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,166
<i>And finally, it was time</i>

163
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,583
<i>for the Eastern Japan Rookie
Championship final.</i>

164
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,458
<i>The match between
Makunouchi and Mashiba had begun.</i>

165
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,458
Now it's about to begin.

166
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,500
Will the Hitman use his flicker jabs?

167
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,166
Or will Makunouchi's dynamite explode?

168
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,875
The outlook is 50-50.

169
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,916
Either way, it should end by KO!

172
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,958
Whoa! Makunouchi has lunged out!

173
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,208
All right!

174
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,125
He's in deep!

175
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,875
Go, kid!

176
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,291
He's studied the weaknesses
of the hitman style thoroughly.

177
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,791
Also, if he's mastered
the timing to go in,

178
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,833
you'll have to change your strategy.

179
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,250
So, now what?
Are you going to raise your guard?

180
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:33,416
If you let him in, you'll have to deal
with his destructive power!

181
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:41,166
His destructive power?
Yeah, it's pretty good.

182
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,541
However, that same power
will give him hell.

183
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,500
The bastard will destroy himself
with his own punches.

184
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,708
<i>His body's open!</i>

185
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,958
Makunouchi throws
a powerful right body blow!

186
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,958
<i>Makunouchi suffered from
the overwhelming difference in reach.</i>

187
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:10,666
<i>His daring leaps to get inside
were elbow blocked.</i>

188
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,208
<i>However, he found a means of attack</i>

189
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,000
<i>through blows to Mashiba's elbow,</i>

190
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,208
<i>and finally brought the match around
to his specialty, infighting.</i>

191
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,166
<i>I'm not finished yet!</i>

192
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,750
Makunouchi throws another right,
aiming for punch-on-punch!

193
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,166
What's this?

194
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,333
Mashiba's left arm is... staying down!

195
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,958
What's wrong with Mashiba?

196
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,625
<i>This is it!</i>

197
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,208
Ryo!

198
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,458
<i>I can't lose!</i>

199
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,208
<i>Hitman... Flicker?!</i>

200
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,958
<i>He's bluffing! Flickers are not coming!</i>

201
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,916
<i>Go!</i>

202
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,166
Kid!

203
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,875
<i>Mashiba wouldn't budge.
Makunouchi wouldn't budge.</i>

204
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,500
<i>It was a fight worthy of a final.</i>

205
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,708
<i>The element that finally settled the match</i>

206
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,333
<i>was Makunouchi's explosive barrage,
fearless of possible injury to his fist.</i>

207
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,416
<i>It's not enough!</i>

208
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,833
<i>It'll take more than this
to make Mashiba-san fall!</i>

209
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,916
<i>It's still not enough!</i>

210
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,958
<i>It'll take more than that
to knock me down!</i>

211
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,000
<i>I'm starting to lose feeling
in my right fist.</i>

212
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,708
<i>I must go now while he's still reeling
from the earlier damage!</i>

213
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,041
No! If he takes a punch
in the face right now,

214
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,208
there's no way he'll withstand it!

215
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,375
I can't lose.

216
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,791
I can't afford to lose!

217
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,458
<i>I can't afford to... I can't afford to lose!</i>

218
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,458
<i>This guy has no intention of letting go!</i>

219
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,375
<i>If that's the case, I have my own plan!</i>

220
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,208
<i>I'm not about to lose!</i>

221
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,666
<i>Why, you...</i>

222
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,416
Neither is compromising!
Both boxers display great tenacity!

223
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,916
Who in the world will fall first?!

224
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,916
Ippo! Keep punching!

225
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,916
You're getting him!

226
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,416
<i>I can't... afford to...</i>

227
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:04,041
<i>Just a little more!</i>

228
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,708
It's coming undone!

229
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,583
Mashiba's clinch is
gradually coming undone!

230
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,750
Get...

231
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,083
off...

232
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,416
of...

233
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,041
me!

234
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,875
He's off!

235
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,625
Go, kid! It's your chance!

236
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,666
Pour your heart
and soul into your punches!

237
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:00,916
Ryo!

238
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,250
He's down! Mashiba falls!

239
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,750
He did it!

240
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,166
Mashiba truly persevered,
but he finally fell for the first time!

241
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,833
And in all likelihood,
this will be a reversal KO!

242
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't want to... lose!

243
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,708
Mashiba exhausted his strength!

244
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,375
He literally sank into the canvas!

245
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,250
I did it.

246
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,708
I won!

247
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,208
I did it!

248
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,291
<i>And that is how Makunouchi conquered
the Eastern Japan Rookie Tournament.</i>

249
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:12,083
<i>It was a time that witnessed a clumsy
boxer blossom into a seasoned fighter.</i>

250
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:17,208
<i>However, Makunouchi's battle
is far from over.</i>

251
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,958
<i>The defeated Mashiba,
and Miyata, who didn't get to fight,</i>

252
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,166
<i>are working towards their next goal.</i>

253
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,500
ROCKY OF NANIWA

254
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,416
<i>And the Featherweight Rookie Champion</i>

255
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,625
<i>of Western Japan, Takeshi Sendo.</i>

256
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,000
<i>You can't beat this fighter</i>

257
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,625
<i>who won his way through
with overwhelming punching power,</i>

258
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,750
<i>without the proper amount of care.</i>

259
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,333
<i>On top of that,</i>

260
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,250
<i>Makunouchi's fist is damaged
from his fight against Mashiba.</i>

261
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,666
<i>Will he be able to fight?
Will he heal in time for the match?</i>

262
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,041
<i>Sendo vs. Makunouchi</i>...

263
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:55,708
<i>A clash between two natural-born fighters.</i>

264
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,416
<i>It will definitely be a fight not to miss.</i>

265
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:04,041
<i>As a reporter, and as a boxing fan,</i>

266
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,208
<i>I'm looking forward to it... Makunouchi!</i>

<i>Slugger.</i>

269

<i>A boxer who combines
fighting instinct and attack power.</i>

270
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,083
<i>A boxer who chooses to be hit
