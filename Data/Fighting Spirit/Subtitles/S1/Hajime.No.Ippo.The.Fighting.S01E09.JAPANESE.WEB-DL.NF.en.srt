He's late.

‪LOOKING FOR NEW FIGHTERS

6
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,729
Welcome back!

7
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,357
-Hey there!
-Why are you standing out here?

8
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,527
Uh, I have my pro
certification exam today.

9
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,612
Oh, yeah. Now I remember.

10
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:56,407
Takamura-san is
supposed to come with me, but...

11
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:00,411
Yeah. He's punctual
when it comes to himself,

12
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:04,082
but he's pretty sloppy
when it's other people's time.

13
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:08,128
All right. As your senior,
I'll help you steel yourself for the exam.

14
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,131
Huh? Uh, sure.

15
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,843
Listen. The most important thing
in the exam is your fighting spirit.

16
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:15,802
Oh.

17
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,930
You must forget what you've learned
and show them you've got the drive.

18
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,515
Hey, what are you talking about?

19
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,059
You won't get anywhere with drive alone.

20
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:23,977
Huh?

21
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,021
Basics are key. The jab...

22
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,567
defense, and footwork.

23
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,943
That's true.

24
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,281
I remember how you ran around in circles
for the whole exam.

25
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,866
Look who's talking.

26
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,451
You're the guy
who's been slinging mud ever since.

27
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,664
You were so stiff and nervous,
I'm amazed you passed at all!

28
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,584
And you looked like you
were about to wet your pants!

29
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,379
Don't laugh!

30
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:55,466
I'm sorry. So, you both took
the certification exam together?

31
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,219
-Well, yeah.
-Sort of.

32
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,471
Now I get it, but...

33
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,726
So, are you feeling more relaxed now?

34
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,936
Uh, oh... Yes!

35
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,063
However!

36
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:13,484
It is possible to be suddenly
matched against someone great like me!

37
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,402
Oh, man!

38
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:18,114
The poor stiff who was pitted against me
couldn't show off any of his stuff

39
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,534
because I knocked him out in ten seconds.

40
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:26,748
That reminds me. I heard Miyata
has already passed the certification exam.

41
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,751
If you fail, it'll build a gap
between you guys again!

42
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,169
Don't say that.

43
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:35,882
Well, although there's no one
as great as me in the entire world!

44
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,842
What are you yakking about?!

45
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,763
Kid! Be confident! With what you've got,
you'll pass for sure!

46
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,306
Uh, right!

47
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,725
If he doesn't screw up.

48
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,560
Oh, shut up!

00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:53,524
C CLASS LICENSE

50
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,091
They all look so strong.
I wonder if they're all taking the exam?

51
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,343
Don't get wigged out! Stop peeking around!

52
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,011
Right!

53
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,975
Give me a break.

54
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,228
Huh?

55
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,815
KORAKUEN HALL

56
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,987
It's that girl!

57
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,913
<i>She's cute!</i>

58
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,423
Well, aren't we feeling cocky?

59
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,467
So, you don't need me
to come along with you?

60
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,219
No... Don't!

61
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,264
Maybe I should wreck you
right now so you can't take the test!

62
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,932
I'm sorry!

63
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,311
NO NON-LICENSED PERSONNEL ALLOWED.
NO SMOKING (4PM UNTIL END OF MATCH)

64
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,939
Number nine. 117,9 pounds.

65
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,275
-Next, Number ten.
-Here!

66
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:23,072
<i>They only check body weight here.
I can't get nervous now!</i>

67
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,700
Number 11. 140,5 pounds.

68
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,786
-Next, Number 12!
-Here!

69
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,417
Number 12. 124,5 pounds.

70
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,888
Uh, excuse me!

71
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,057
Next, Number 13.

72
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,646
<i>He's kind of scary-looking.
He looks strong, too.</i>

73
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,149
Number 13. 125,66 pounds.

74
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,400
Huh?

75
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,152
<i>That's about the same as me!</i>

76
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:23,299
He'll be taking the written test by now,
but I'm sure he'll do fine.

77
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,426
-Hey, Takamura.
-Huh?

78
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,054
Hi, Fujii-chan! Doing an article?

79
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,806
Today, I'm just observing.

80
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,934
It's my policy to follow around boxers
who catch my attention.

81
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:36,270
You followed me all the way here?
All right, why don't you name it

82
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,441
"Exclusive Coverage!
A Day in the Life of Mamoru Takamura"?

83
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,443
How has Makunouchi-kun been?

84
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,657
He's so nervous, he's shaking like a leaf!

85
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,701
Fujii-chan, you must be bored
chasing around a small-shot like him.

86
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,538
I'm not after Makunouchi-kun exclusively.

87
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,207
One other fighter interests me.

88
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:05,716
<i>Miyata-kun already passed the exam.
I can't fall behind!</i>

89
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,267
-What's your problem?
-Keep it down!

90
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,185
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,062
Here, you can use this.

92
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,107
Thank you so much! Ow!

93
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,113
-What a joke.
-He's helpless.

94
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,949
Maybe he should go into comedy instead.

95
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,329
Thank you for your kindness earlier.

96
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,541
Huh? Oh, it's you.

97
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,126
Don't worry about it.

98
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,628
We're both in the featherweight class,
aren't we?

99
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,465
Thanks to you, I was able to relax a lot.

100
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,216
It was nothing.

101
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,343
Anyway, let's both do our best.

102
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,636
Yeah!

103
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,888
Huh?

104
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,559
Right.

105
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,775
SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS
OF THE PRO CERTIFICATION EXAM

106
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,282
What's his problem?

107
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,868
Begin!

108
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,703
Hey, what are you doing?!

109
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,330
Defense! Remember practice!

110
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,665
It's just a test, so relax!

111
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,125
Use your hand!

112
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,044
Use your feet!

113
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,130
What pathetic sparring!

114
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,799
That's usually how it is with applicants.

115
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,553
When I took the exam,
everyone was pathetic, myself excluded.

116
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,559
Next, Number five and six! Into the ring!

117
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,813
By the way,
I haven't seen Makunouchi-kun yet.

118
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,317
Hey, you're right.
Where did he wander off to?

119
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,822
The Chief said I'd pass for sure,

120
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,826
but I really do tend to screw up
at the most crucial moments.

121
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,081
I have to relax.
My opponent is an applicant just like me.

122
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,333
Ah, so there you are!

123
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,835
-It's almost your turn!
-Uh, right!

124
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,382
-Were you able to relax?
-Yeah, sort of.

125
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,179
-Hey, Ippo!
-Yes?

126
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,644
Go out there and spill your blood!

127
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,895
I don't want to!

128
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,983
-Then go out there and feed him leather!
-Yes, sir!

129
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,986
Next, Number 11 and 12! Into the ring!

130
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,405
-Yeah!
-Go on!

131
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,410
Show them what you've got!

132
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,795
Listen, don't concern yourselves
with winning or losing.

133
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,214
Try to show the basics
you learned at your gyms.

134
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:54,218
Yeah. Don't rely on your right straight.
Use the left.

135
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,679
<i>What's he mumbling about?</i>

136
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,432
<i>I lucked out getting
this guy to fight with.</i>

137
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,768
He seems nervous as usual.

138
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,687
Did my efforts go down the drain?

139
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:08,941
Begin!

140
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,111
<i>Here I come, Mr. Mumble!</i>

141
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,083
<i>I can see it!</i>

142
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,087
<i>Compared to Miyata-kun's speed,
it's almost like slow-motion!</i>

143
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,841
Hey, it's that klutz from earlier.

144
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,927
I thought he looked slow,
but he's actually rather good.

145
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,599
Oh, good moves.

146
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,859
<i>He's wide open!</i>

147
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:18,135
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

148
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,514
Hey, that right straight
completely flipped the guy over!

149
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,350
-Amazing!
-What a big move!

150
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,143
He's a monster.

151
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,275
He used jabs to stop his opponent
and sent a straight punch.

152
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,278
The power of his punches is extraordinary.

153
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,614
He's not bad, for applicant level.

154
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,783
Gosh, you surprised me.
That was an awesome punch!

155
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,076
Uh, thanks.

156
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,953
I'm up next.

157
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,579
Good luck!

158
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,832
Next, Number 13 and 14!

159
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,334
Okay, let's go!

160
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,754
Knock him down.

161
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,005
<i>-It's that guy.</i>
-Use your jab.

162
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,262
Begin!

163
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,222
-Go for it!
-All right!

164
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,230
-Jab!
-Hey, what are you waiting for?!

165
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,359
Hey, Fujii-chan!
Is this the other guy you're after?

166
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,735
Just watch. You'll see.

167
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,489
Go!

168
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,242
-Come on!
-Hey, get a move on!

169
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,547
-Hey...
-That's right. Flicker jabs.

170
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,395
The rush of flicker jabs. That pattern.

171
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,523
He's fast! Also, each punch
is beautifully supported by his hip.

172
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,534
Stop! Number 13!

173
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,539
The bell! Ring the bell!

174
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,509
He's beyond applicant level.

175
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,803
Yeah. His boxing has
a high level of perfection.

176
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,732
SOUTH SEATS

177
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,079
You need a strong spine
to make it as a pro.

178
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:54,333
But he didn't have to go to
that kind of extreme at an exam.

179
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,837
Do you have the leeway to be upset
about that right now?

180
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,050
Did you notice the jab that
triggered the rush of punches?

181
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,345
Uh, yeah. He made some weird movement.

182
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,846
That is called a flicker jab.

183
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,473
Flicker jab?

184
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,185
It's Hearns' special move.

185
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,105
Hearns? You mean
the famous Thomas Hearns?!

186
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,523
<i>You got it!</i>

187
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,526
<i>The guy whose punches
made him a champion in five ranks.</i>

188
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,363
<i>A flicker jab always triggered
the explosion of strong punches.</i>

189
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,118
Makunouchi-kun.

190
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,037
I thought I should introduce you.

191
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,373
This is Mashiba-kun of Toho Gym.

192
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,210
This is Makunouchi-kun of Kamogawa Gym.

193
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,880
-You're both featherweights...
-As long as I exist...

194
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,384
you won't reach the top
of the featherweight class.

195
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,971
Want to switch classes?

196
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,102
I will not switch classes.

197
00:14:55,811 --> 00:15:00,649
I promised to see someone
at the Eastern Japan Rookie Tournament.

198
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:06,155
Naturally, I'm not totally sure
that I'll make it there, but...

199
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,992
I'm working hard with that as my goal.

200
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,163
That's why I will not switch from
the featherweight class, no matter what!

201
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:35,684
{\an8}SHOIN HIGH SCHOOL

202
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,940
{\an8}Good afternoon!

203
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,399
Excuse me!

204
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,234
Would you keep the noise down?

205
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,861
Oh, I'm sorry!

206
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,447
Yagi-san, you said it
would arrive today, right?!

207
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,658
Yup, it's here.

208
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,203
Here you go. Congratulations!

209
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,666
Thank you so much!

210
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,835
Good for you, Ippo.

211
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,963
I'm so happy!

212
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,923
I couldn't sleep at all last night

213
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,176
and I couldn't
concentrate at all in school today!

214
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,511
Wow!

215
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,929
I don't know why,

216
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,306
but when I actually hold the license,
it feels so real!

217
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,850
It renders you speechless!

218
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,603
<i>This is not good.
I need to get with the program.</i>

219
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,772
-I have to go and help my mother now!
-Kid!

220
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,525
Don't get carried away
just because you became a pro!

221
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,403
You need to start preparing for
your debut match by running!

222
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,281
If you're looking for Ippo-kun,

223
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,994
he said he had to go home
to help out his mother.

224
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,956
Goodbye!

225
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,845
Hey there. Long time no see, Ippo.

226
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,221
Ume...

227
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,391
We missed you horribly, you know!

228
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:02,396
Lately, you've been going home
right after school lets out.

229
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,357
Why don't you hang out
with us once in a while?

230
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,821
We saw you.
You're going to a boxing gym, huh?

231
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,739
What?

232
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:16,744
You bastard! I bet you've been training
to get revenge against us.

233
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,704
You've got some nerve!

234
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,457
What? That's not why I'm going.

235
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,499
Shut up!

236
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,379
What's this? A driver's license?

237
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,592
Professional boxing license?!

238
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,636
Registered with Kamogawa Gym?
Is this for real?

239
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,347
There's no need to get scared.

240
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,599
In this day and age,

241
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,768
even celebrities can get
a professional license.

242
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,062
I'm sure anyone can get one.

243
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,605
Please give it back!

244
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,106
I don't think so!

245
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,235
Anyway, I can't believe it.
Is this guy a professional boxer?

246
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:56,033
Why don't we experiment
and see just how strong he's got!

247
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,788
<i>My license!</i>

248
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:21,517
I didn't start boxing for
a pitiful reason like revenge.

249
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,354
I'm going to be a professional boxer
because I love boxing!

250
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,608
Is this a dream?

251
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,319
I can't believe it.

252
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,155
Him, a boxer?

253
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,123
<i>I'm so glad I got it back.</i>

254
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,876
<i>It's been six months
since I met Takamura-san,</i>

255
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,212
<i>when I used to be bullied all the time.</i>

256
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,756
<i>I've come a long way.</i>

257
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,634
<i>I got permission from Mom.</i>

258
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,388
<i>I'm finally a real professional boxer!</i>

259
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,891
<i>I'll do my best! Huh?</i>

260
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,896
Goodbye!

261
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,107
{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

262
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,903
All right!

263
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,408
Huh?

264
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,120
You've got a lot of guts to challenge me.

265
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,539
Seems like you're
preparing for your debut match.

266
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,125
Takamura-san! Me, challenge you?

267
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,918
I just didn't see you there!

268
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,629
Come on! Take a shot at me, Ippo!

269
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,174
But I don't stand a chance against you.

270
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,802
Giving up before you even try won't
get you ahead in the world of pro boxing!

271
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,722
Here I come!

272
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,934
-Not bad, Ippo.
-All right!

273
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,227
Just kidding!

274
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,233
It'll be a million years
before you can take me on!

275
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,694
That's mean!

276
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,362
Hello!

277
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,573
Hey, Fujii-chan!

278
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,867
I brought a video
I think Makunouchi-kun should see.

279
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,036
A video?

280
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,632
One minute and 33 seconds
into the first round of his debut match,

281
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,052
Ichiro Miyata scores
a brilliant KO victory.

282
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,595
That's how I'd write it.

283
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,556
Ippo wouldn't be able to beat him
in his current shape.

284
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,394
Miyata-kun really is amazing!

285
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,522
I have to work harder
or I'll be left behind.

286
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,107
Hold it!

287
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,609
There's one more tape.

288
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,076
Mashiba-san!

289
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,592
He scored an instant KO with
the barrage following the flicker jab.

290
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,804
Ryo Mashiba lands an overwhelming victory
in his debut match.

291
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,557
What a flashy victory.

292
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,396
I'm returning to practice.

293
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,279
I envy you! The featherweight class
looks like a lot of fun.

294
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,452
You buttinsky.

295
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,916
Yes, Miyata-kun and Mashiba-kun are
way past the level of your average newbie.

296
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,420
However, Makunouchi-kun also
has an amazing, destructive single punch.

297
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,090
It's amazing that
he doesn't realize that for himself.

298
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,442
-Ippo-kun!
-Yes?

299
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,154
-What is it?
-I have good news.

300
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,364
-Good news?
-Ooh, what is it?

301
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,909
Kid, the opponent for your debut match
has been selected.

302
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,375
The name of your opponent is...

303
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,789
<i>The straight punch.</i>

304
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,792
<i>A basic punch
that all boxers must acquire.</i>

305
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,461
<i>A long-distance form which
causes damage to one's opponent.</i>

306
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,966
<i>Sometimes, that single punch
can turn the flow of the match,</i>

307
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,968
<i>and cut off the opponent's resilience.</i>

308
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,970
<i>Even if they tell me I'll win easily,</i>

309
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,180
<i>I can't underestimate him!</i>

310
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,725
<i>Because it will be my first time
in that ring!</i>

311
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,019
<i>Next time, "Debut Match!"</i>
