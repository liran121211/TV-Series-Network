ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,993
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,989
<i>The key to getting close to Mashiba
is my dart-and-dash.</i>

4
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,700
<i>I've been running to improve that, but...</i>

5
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,914
<i>I haven't sparred since then,</i>

6
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,042
<i>so I can't tell if my step-in
has improved.</i>

7
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,342
<i>But I have no chance
of winning if I don't dive in.</i>

8
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,678
<i>No matter how hard it is...</i>

9
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,014
<i>I have to dive in!</i>

10
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,855
THE BATTLE FOR DISTANCE

11
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,611
TANAKA TRANSPORT

12
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,003
Hey, Mashiba! Are you done?
Good work, man!

13
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,965
Thanks.

14
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:57,051
Well, he's grumpy as usual.

15
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,554
That's why he gets shut out at work.

16
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,638
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,224
Oh, Kumi-chan. I didn't know
you were here!

18
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,226
I brought something Ryo forgot at home.

19
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,563
I'm sorry. It's not
that I meant to badmouth him.

20
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,399
I already know he's just that kind of guy.

21
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,901
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,572
But I'm sure he appreciates you as well.

23
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,408
He's been able to hold down his job here

24
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,118
for a long time thanks to you.

25
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,288
What? Well, regardless of his past,

26
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,333
he's doing his best right now.

27
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,253
He's just a little clumsy
and not good at socializing.

28
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:36,049
The people around him will come
to realize that before long.

29
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,134
He's a boxer after all.

30
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,178
He literally risks his life on the ropes.

31
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,014
Not everyone can do that!

32
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,183
Maybe, but I'm not crazy about boxing.

33
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,813
He trains hard,
goes through horrible diets, suffers,

34
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,941
gets even more hurt in the fights,

35
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,651
and even if he wins...

36
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,906
The more he wins,
the stronger his opponents become.

37
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,242
The thought of it scares me.

38
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,287
Hey, I didn't know you were here.

39
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,915
Oh, Ryo! You forgot your workout clothes.

40
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,167
You're going to
the gym again today, right?

41
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,631
Oh, come on! She came all the way here
to bring it to you.

42
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,758
You could at least thank her!

43
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,635
It doesn't bother me.

44
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,513
He's preoccupied with the upcoming match.

45
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,098
Yeah, but still.

46
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,599
Thank you for your time.

47
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,559
What? Sure.

48
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,564
<i>Big brother looks out for little sister,</i>

49
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,776
<i>and little sister looks out
for big brother.</i>

{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

51
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,660
Hey, get into the ring.
We're going to spar.

52
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,078
What? But I'm not supposed to.

53
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,039
Chief's instructions. We'll help you out.

54
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,792
Chief? Is it okay for me to use my fists?

55
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,296
Yeah. They should be healed by now.

56
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,008
Show me the moves you've been working on
in shadow boxing.

57
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,343
All right, finally! Here goes.

58
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,930
Unfortunately, I can't throw flickers.

59
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,141
I'll be sticking to long left jabs.

60
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,059
I'm pretty quick too.

61
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,813
-If I don't think about the next punch.
-Get ready.

62
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,356
-Kid!
-Sir?

63
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,108
Even if you do get near him,

64
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,610
your reach is too short
to get Mashiba's face.

65
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,987
Aim at his body first.

66
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,365
Keep going for body blows,
and he'll eventually lower his chin.

67
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,867
Right!

68
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,119
Spar with the final match in mind!

69
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,121
Put your heart into it!

70
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,206
-Here it comes, Ippo!
-Right!

71
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,709
This is your sparring partner.

72
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:38,212
He came from another gym
just for your final tune-up.

73
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,255
Hello.

74
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,717
He's an onrush-type boxer.

75
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,220
He's almost identical to Makunouchi
in height and build too.

76
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,558
Mashiba, where's your headgear?

77
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,226
I don't need it.

78
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,239
Whoa, he's fast!

79
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,498
He can't even get close to Mashiba,
never mind punch him.

80
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,506
Why, you...

81
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,135
Ippo's weaving is pretty good, huh?

82
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,303
Sort of.

83
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:31,015
Mashiba will have trouble zeroing
in on Ippo if he weaves like that.

84
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,518
Now all he has to do
is improve his step-in.

85
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:38,439
It won't be easy to dive
in through jabs that fast.

86
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:56,666
All right! You're fully prepared,
physically and emotionally!

87
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,252
The Rookie Championship title is ours!

88
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,214
Hey, you! Don't back off!
Jump right in, will you?!

89
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,717
But it's kind of difficult with
all these fast jabs coming at me!

90
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,595
If you can't do it by now, it's hopeless!

91
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,973
You'll be beaten to a pulp
and you will lose!

92
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,644
<i>I have to go in!</i>

93
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,981
<i>I don't think so!</i>

94
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,546
What horrific dart-and-dash power!

95
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,008
He dove in a flash,
while diverting the opponent's attention.

96
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,303
So, this is the result of him
working on nothing but weaving

97
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,847
and dart-and-dash
while he couldn't use his fists.

98
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,016
That really caught me off-guard.

99
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,727
His punch was that much sharper
with the added speed.

100
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,479
Amazing.

101
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,772
It was like an out-of-body experience.

102
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,107
I went forward so easily.

103
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:09,197
Hey, kid! We're going to win
the Rookie Championship final!

104
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,157
Yes, sir!

105
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,078
{\an8}KOURAKUEN HALL

106
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,582
Now, the day has finally arrived!

107
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,584
Eastern Japan Rookie
Championship Tournament!

108
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,502
EASTERN JAPAN ROOKIE
CHAMPIONSHIP TOURNAMENT

109
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,839
Kourakuen Hall has already
reached a fever pitch excitement!

110
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,967
The elite boxers
who have fought long and hard...

111
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,346
for the last six months,
are all gathered here today!

112
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,850
Who will be the strongest rookie
in this year's Eastern Japan block?

113
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,604
We have exciting cards of events
from middle class to straw class!

114
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,607
We can't take our eyes off any of them!

115
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,530
ROOM D

116
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,324
Mashiba, you've gotten stronger all-around

117
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,618
since your match
with Miyata one month ago.

118
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,579
On top of that, your final tuning
was the best to date.

119
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,623
You can get the Rookie title!

120
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,125
No, duh.

121
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,380
How could I possibly lose?

122
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,632
ROOM B

123
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,343
Well, we're headed up
to the spectator stand.

124
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,637
We want to check out our own weight class.

125
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,056
Of course. Go ahead.

126
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,892
Make sure you get that Rookie title!

127
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,146
Do it for those of us
who didn't quite make it there.

128
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,901
Well, since it was all too easy
for <i>me</i> to make Rookie of the Year,

129
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,321
I have no hopes to pin on you,
but do your best anyway.

130
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,285
Fight, Ippo!

131
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,911
Knock that sucker out!

132
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,877
He's under a lot of pressure.

133
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,463
Yeah, his butt's been glued to that bench.

134
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,465
Well, he is up against that Mashiba.

135
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,468
Ordinarily, he'd be doing
warm-up exercises by now.

136
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,429
-Maybe he doesn't need to.
-What?

137
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,683
Didn't you feel the heat
when you touched his shoulder?

138
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,020
It means his body is
already in battle mode.

139
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,689
All he needs now is the opening bell.

140
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,942
<i>He's keeping it bottled up until it rings.</i>

141
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,112
<i>He's stockpiling his energy...</i>

142
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,948
<i>for the moment he can let it explode!</i>

143
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:28,836
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

144
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,841
The winner, Ishiwata!

145
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,346
Thank God the junior light winner
is a total pushover.

146
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,140
Yeah, but the light class winner
is so strong it's not funny.

147
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,976
And now, the 7th match of the day,

148
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,689
the featherweight class Eastern Japan
Rookie Championship Tournament final!

149
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,234
Finally the featherweight class final
is about to begin.

150
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,654
This is the most talked-of card
in the tournament.

151
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,990
These boxers advanced
through the most difficult block

152
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,660
to be here today, and here they come!

153
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,996
This boxer's fighting style
deserves the name "Hitman."

154
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,666
He conquered B Block with
his deadly weapon, the flicker jab...

155
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,417
Ryo Mashiba.

156
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,671
And this boxer scaled the A Block ladder

157
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:16,133
by sinking the title number one favorite,
Ryuichi Hayami, into the mat,

158
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:20,429
the incredible hard puncher...
Ippo Makunouchi!

159
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,639
Here he comes!

160
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,932
Beat him, Ippo!

161
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,060
Indeed, this is an interesting face-off.

162
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,269
It is not an overstatement

163
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,688
to say that points will not be deciding
the winner!

164
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,060
Look, they're full of fighting spirit!

165
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,187
Boxers to center!

166
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,442
Hey!

167
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,402
All right! Stare down!

168
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,570
That's the spirit!

169
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,447
-Don't look away!
-Go for a KO!

170
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,240
Don't let him leave in one piece!

171
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,409
You guys really stir us up!

172
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,120
Good. Return to your corners.

173
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,540
Now it's about to begin.

174
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,834
Will the Hitman take out
his mark with flicker jabs?

175
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,004
Or will Makunouchi's dynamite explode?

176
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,089
The outlook is 50-50.

177
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,633
Either way, it should end by KO!

178
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,887
Anyway, stick to close range!
Fight at close range at all times!

179
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,013
Right!

180
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,890
They can only fight at close range.

181
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,767
Stop him with your jabs
and get him at long-range, got it?

182
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,144
{\an8}REMAINING TIME

183
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,270
{\an8}Round one!

184
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,483
Both contenders are ready for action!
The most anticipated match,

185
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,986
the feather class Eastern Japan
Rookie Championship Tournament final!

186
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,202
Whoa! Makunouchi has lunged out!

187
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,042
He missed!

188
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,877
He missed, but what a tremendous swish!

189
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,880
The audience reels
from the psychological impact!

190
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,757
That's not like him.

191
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,092
He threw caution to the wind
and charged right in!

192
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,761
That's how fired up he is!

193
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,474
Now Mashiba keeps
Makunouchi at a distance.

194
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,517
And even more so!

195
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,356
What's this? He's already taking up
the hitman style!

196
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,525
He's in position to launch flicker jabs.

197
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,026
Right from the get-go?!

198
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,074
Makunouchi follows suit,

199
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,035
ready to respond with
his own "peek-a-boo" style!

200
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,413
He's too far away! He's just bluffing.

201
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,999
Ippo's first big swing scared him.

202
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,042
You think so?

203
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,546
<i>I'm going to get to
the very edge of his striking distance</i>

204
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,422
<i>and dash into him!</i>

205
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,427
<i>Not yet. Just a little closer.</i>

206
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,138
What?!

207
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,891
It connected! The first hit
belongs to Mashiba!

208
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,978
I'm sure it's hard to believe,
but that's Mashiba's striking distance.

209
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,816
<i>No way! He reached me from there?!</i>

210
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,527
<i>But I studied his tapes thoroughly!</i>

211
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,698
The contenders stare each other down.

212
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,409
Mashiba gauges the best timing
to launch his flicker jabs.

213
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,412
Meanwhile, Makunouchi edges forward
to shorten the distance.

214
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,997
The difference in reach is obvious.

215
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,417
As long as they stay apart,
Makunouchi has no chance of victory!

216
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,671
<i>The extension of his arm was unbelievable.</i>

217
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,132
<i>Screw striking distance.</i>

218
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,427
<i>As long as I'm in the ring,
I'm in his striking distance!</i>

219
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,471
<i>I can't do anything unless I step forward.</i>

220
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,933
<i>But at this rate,
I have no idea when to move!</i>

221
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,476
<i>Damn it!</i>

222
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,898
That idiot! He's forgotten everything
he practiced about bobbing his head

223
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,608
in the heat of the moment!

224
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,109
<i>Damn!</i>

225
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,613
The distance between
the two fighters gradually shrinks.

226
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,115
<i>Should I time my attack
to Mashiba-san's swings?</i>

227
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,576
<i>Or should I dive in out of nowhere?</i>

228
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,300
-You idiot!
-Airhead!

229
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,593
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

230
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,106
The opportunity didn't slip him by!
It's a flicker barrage!

231
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,611
Makunouchi is caught! He fell for it hard!

232
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,615
Makunouchi jumps to the side!

233
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,452
But he cannot leave striking distance!
He's caught on the rope!

234
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,829
Mashiba is strong in this position!

235
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,706
The flickers are unrelenting!

236
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,832
That idiot!

237
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,709
I can't believe he fell for that feint!

238
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,629
What skill!

239
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,048
He aimed his flickers on the face
and got his cheek!

240
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,346
<i>Chopping right!</i>

241
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,232
He escaped death!

242
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,567
Makunouchi somehow managed
to escape death.

243
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,694
But Mashiba is tough!

244
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,571
He allows Makunouchi no chance to jump in!

245
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,535
<i>Those sharp flicker jabs,
and that heavy chopping right!</i>

246
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,205
<i>I thought he learned boxing
from the street,</i>

247
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,165
<i>but his combinations are amazing!</i>

248
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,547
<i>This guy is truly powerful.</i>

249
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,551
Mashiba, that bastard!
He had the perfect chance.

250
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,302
Is he tormenting him little by little?

251
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:56,390
He's probably keeping away
while Ippo still has life in his punches.

252
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,185
Mashiba is a conniving fox.

253
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,689
Mashiba lashes out once again!

254
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,693
Bob your head, fool!
Those punches are going to hurt later!

255
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,283
<i>Damn it!</i>

256
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,743
This is bad.

257
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,078
You can tell by his face
that he can't even hear the Chief.

258
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,832
Oh, come on! This is exactly
when he needs to be clever.

259
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,043
-Actually, maybe it's better that way.
-What?

260
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,670
He has a ticked-off look in his eyes.

261
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,716
That's how his eyes looked
when he was training to fight Mashiba.

262
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,515
<i>He's strong! This guy is really strong!</i>

263
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,519
<i>But if that's true, then why?</i>

264
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,151
<i>Tightening up your guard like a clam.</i>

265
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,195
<i>How long do you think that's gonna hold?</i>

266
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,380
<i>If you're this strong, then why?</i>

267
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,719
<i>Why did you pull such a dirty trick
on Miyata-kun?!</i>

268
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:21,016
Oh, my! Makunouchi starts
to sway back and forth!

269
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,228
Is Mashiba unable to aim properly?
He's not launching his flickers!

270
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,395
Don't stop!

271
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,773
Keep punching from the left!
He's going to charge you!

272
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,454
-All right!
-He's in!

273
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,206
Go, kid!

274
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,550
My God, the bell rang!

275
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,343
The first round is over!

276
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,596
All right, break it up.
Back to your corners!

277
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,724
The scores here at the box
are ten to nine.

278
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,102
The first round goes to Mashiba.

279
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,104
However, the match has just begun.

280
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,398
We can't wait for round two!

281
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,533
So what's your impression
of fighting Mashiba face-to-face?

282
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,202
He's strong.

283
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,205
I thought he might be more
of a rough fighter,

284
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,500
but his techniques are brilliant.
And his reach...

285
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,418
That's true.

286
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,297
But I got the feel for going in deep.

287
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,548
Good!

288
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,885
But don't get optimistic
just because you got in a couple times!

289
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,344
Keep swaying your body!

290
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,638
And as soon as you're in, deliver a right!

291
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,182
Don't forget these two points!

292
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,892
-Yes, sir!
-Right on!

293
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,687
He's studied the weaknesses
of the hitman style thoroughly.

294
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,524
Also, if he's mastered
the timing to go in,

295
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,193
you'll have to change your strategy.

296
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,695
So, now what?
Are you going to raise your guard?

297
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,699
If you let him in, you'll have to deal
with his destructive power!

298
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,582
His destructive power?
Yeah, it's pretty good.

299
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,377
However, that same power
will give him hell.

300
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,756
The bastard will destroy himself
with his own punches.

301
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:17,841
REMAINING TIME

302
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,635
Now for round two.

303
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,971
Makunouchi begins to sway
his body as he did earlier.

304
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,140
And in defense, Mashiba...

305
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,060
is assuming hitman style as expected!

306
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,312
Ippo didn't do so hot in round one,

307
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,522
except for the last move
when he got inside.

308
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,442
Yeah. Just a little more,
and his right would've hit home.

309
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,401
He's got a chance!

310
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,862
<i>This bothers me.</i>

311
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:43,408
<i>Ippo's right-attack strategy
isn't a secret anymore,</i>

312
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,870
<i>so why isn't Mashiba raising his guard?</i>

313
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,257
<i>I won't let you get away!</i>

314
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,474
Whoa! Mashiba cannot maintain
his distance!

315
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,769
It's the complete opposite of round one!
Now Makunouchi is the aggressor!

316
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,813
Crank up the pressure!

317
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,273
You'll get in soon!

318
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,113
<i>He's against the rope! It's my chance!</i>

319
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,952
-There you go!
-You snuck in!

320
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,955
<i>His body's open!</i>

321
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,803
Makunouchi throws
a powerful right body blow!

322
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:03,071
That sounded awfully good.

323
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,908
<i>An elbow block!</i>

324
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:15,000
{\an8}KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

325
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,027
<i>The elbow block.</i>

326
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,988
<i>A technique that uses the elbow
to block an opponent's punches.</i>

327
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:31,660
<i>Not only does it block
a potential body blow,</i>

328
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,704
<i>it also does damage
to the opponent's fist.</i>

329
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,249
<i>But I have no choice but to keep punching.</i>

330
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,084
<i>Turning it into a close-range fight</i>

331
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,044
<i>is my only way to break through.</i>

332
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,130
<i>And if it doesn't work, I can't win.</i>

333
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,841
<i>That's all I believed in to get here!</i>

334
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,260
<i>Next time, "Death Match."</i>
