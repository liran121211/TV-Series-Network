00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,275
Hey, it's Ippo! Let's catch him!

5
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,946
What's with you guys?!

6
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,740
It's too hard! He runs too fast!

7
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,076
We're sick of running after him.

8
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,537
You lazy wimps!

00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:11,297
<i>I finally get to spar
with Miyata-kun today!</i>

12
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:22,308
I'm home! Where's today's luggage? Hurry!

13
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:27,105
How come you're in such a big hurry?
Okay, load up those small shrimp.

14
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,148
Sure!

15
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,525
Wait! I said shrimp!

16
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,818
Huh?

17
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,071
Oops! I'm sorry! You wanted shrimp!

18
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,824
Shrimp! Shrimp are over here!

19
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,618
It's heavier than it looks.

20
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,246
Ippo, don't worry about me. You can go.

21
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,581
{\an8}Huh?

22
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,542
{\an8}Don't you have something important
to do at the gym today?

23
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,127
{\an8}I'm sorry.

24
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:54,215
You silly boy. Go get ready and get going!

25
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,722
-Hey, Mom?
-What is it?

26
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:04,893
Have I changed at all compared to
how I was three months ago?

27
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,561
What?

28
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,188
Uh, no! It's nothing!

29
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:12,901
Ippo?

30
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,448
I'll give you a little tip. It's a trick
that I learned from your father.

31
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,699
A trick?

32
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,702
Your father was always ready for a fight.

33
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,622
When he fought
someone stronger than himself,

34
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:30,335
he would stare at his opponent's face
to see if he resembled a kind of fish.

35
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,796
<i>"He's a tuna!"</i>

36
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,091
<i>"How can a man of the sea be afraid
of a tuna?" he would say.</i>

37
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,094
Apparently, that helped to
ease the tension in his shoulders

38
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,889
and calmed him down tremendously.

39
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,601
That's so like Dad!

40
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,603
Isn't it?

41
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,067
Thanks, Mom.

42
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,236
See you later!

43
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,643
<i>She's cute!</i>

44
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,650
<i>She sure smells good!</i>

45
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,283
<i>Boy, was she cute!</i>

46
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,327
<i>Maybe something good will happen today!</i>

47
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,170
<i>That was the message
from the confident champion</i>

48
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:00,341
<i>who is ready to defend
the championship for a third time.</i>

49
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,304
<i>Now, let's turn to the challenger
for his comment.</i>

50
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,985
Hello!

51
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,864
I'm Fujii with
<i>Monthly Boxing Fan Magazine.</i>

52
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,283
Hi, I haven't seen you in a while.

53
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,494
Hey, isn't there supposed
to be a press conference today

54
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,621
for the challenger of
the World Title Match?

55
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,790
Shouldn't you be there?

56
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,084
I sent my lackey to cover it.

57
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,462
I don't think the guy stands a chance

58
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,257
of getting the title and I prefer to use
my time more efficiently.

59
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,633
That's harsh.

60
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,802
Anyway, getting down to business,

61
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,012
we're currently planning

62
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,765
a new article series
called "Meeting New Faces."

63
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,894
We'd be getting close-up interviews
with the hopefuls of various gyms.

64
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:57,023
I'm sorry to just barge in,
but can I get some comments from Miyata?

65
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,233
Uh, actually...

66
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,528
Interviewing Miyata is more important
to you than the World Title Match?

67
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,073
I see you've kept your wayward ways!

68
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:11,120
I merely want to interview
boxers who I believe have potential.

69
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,083
Never mind Miyata...
Couldn't you cover me once in a while?

70
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,419
Why would he want to
cover the king of mud wrestling?

71
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,962
What did you say?!

72
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,091
-Do you have a problem with that?
-None whatsoever.

73
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,094
Hi, Takamura. What's with the bowtie?

74
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,596
We're about to have
a sparring session downstairs.

75
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,349
I'm going to be the acting referee.

76
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:35,561
It's going to be a pretty serious match,
so I need to look decent.

77
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,438
Oh, yeah? Who's fighting?

78
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,981
Your beloved Miyata.

79
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,567
Ooh, what luck!

80
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,571
Yagi-san, if I promise to take
good photos, I can cover it, right?

81
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,241
It's a sparring match
between two new pre-debutants...

82
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,244
so I didn't want outsiders in on it,
but I suppose so.

83
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:55,289
Wow. You have a new guy
who can compete with Miyata?

84
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,084
I'll call it
"When Two Golden Eggs Collide."

85
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,128
Well, you could say that.

86
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,088
-Huh?!
-What?!

87
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,258
Well, sure, Ippo is doing his best, but...

88
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,594
I understand why you'd call Miyata
a golden egg.

89
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,597
He's my equal, and I'm two rounds up
in a six-round class.

90
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,765
You're not his equal.

91
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,392
-Shut up!
-You shut up.

92
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,437
I'll devote myself to
playing referee this time

93
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,523
because I think this could be
a turning point for them.

94
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,483
Give me a break!

95
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,111
I have a feeling this
will turn out to be very interesting.

96
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,344
<i>Calm down!</i>

97
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,013
Ippo! Miyata!

98
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,391
Are you ready? We're going to get started!

99
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,018
I can start at any time.

100
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,312
Uh, please wait a second!

101
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,940
Don't get nervous!

102
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:09,614
Two, three, four. Two, two, three, four.

103
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,327
Oh, come on. That kid is
Kamogawa Gym's secret fireball?

104
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,579
He looks like a wimp to me.

105
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,915
Ordinarily, I'd agree with you.

106
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,877
<i>Well, it doesn't really matter,
because I'm after Miyata-kun.</i>

107
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,380
<i>For now, I guess I'll see what he's got.</i>

108
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,721
The rules are the same as last time.
Four rounds and three knock-downs.

109
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,558
No headgear and the gloves
are the regulation match of eight ounces.

110
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,394
Don't treat this like a practice match.

111
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,730
Fight as though this is the real thing.

112
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,816
-Yes, sir!
-Good, back to your corners!

113
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:55,701
<i>It's no good! My heart feels
like it's going to leap out of my mouth!</i>

114
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,246
<i>I can barely stand!</i>

115
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:02,416
<i>Oh, yeah! A fish! Think he's a fish!</i>

116
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,962
<i>It's impossible!</i>

117
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,006
<i>No fish is that good-looking!</i>

118
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,175
<i>I can't think of anything!</i>

119
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,013
Listen, there's no reason to hesitate.

120
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,474
Just do what you've been doing.

121
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,892
Yes, sir!

122
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,770
-What's so funny?
-Nothing, sir.

123
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,856
Huh! You're more relaxed than I thought.

124
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,191
Thanks to you, Chief!

125
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:31,988
Oh, really? Okay, show me everything
you've learned in the last three months.

126
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,155
Right!

127
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:39,620
He's right. I just need to do
what I've learned.

128
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,081
Don't hesitate!

129
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,709
His punches have real power.

130
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,335
Don't worry.

131
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,590
No matter how powerful they are,
they're pointless if they don't connect.

132
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,353
I practiced every single day
until I felt like a rag doll,

133
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,938
until I finally achieved it.

134
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,108
My... counterpunch.

135
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,325
No matter who my opponent is,
I'll face him fair and square,

136
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,618
and I will rise to the top!

137
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,461
Ippo took the initiative!

138
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,965
<i>I can't let Miyata-kun keep a distance.</i>

139
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,801
<i>I need to catch him within my range!</i>

140
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,511
<i>Hmph! Catch me if you can!</i>

141
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,182
Wow!

142
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,560
Ippo's learned to make good jabs.

143
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,272
<i>He's definitely impressive
for a non-licensed newbie.</i>

144
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,859
<i>However, Miyata-kun's footwork
is even more impressive.</i>

145
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,905
<i>Amazing.</i>

146
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,450
<i>He's far better than when I last saw him.</i>

147
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,745
<i>I thought I captured him perfectly
in shadow boxing,</i>

148
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,122
<i>but his image is
nothing like the real thing!</i>

149
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,168
<i>Remain calm! You must remain calm!</i>

150
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,295
<i>Remember everything you've learned so far!</i>

151
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,964
<i>It's this way!</i>

152
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,052
<i>Oops! I got it backwards!</i>

153
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,263
<i>His left foot is in front! I'll get him!</i>

154
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,940
Miyata's footwork is brilliant, huh?

155
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,943
I never saw him use those moves
in regular sparring.

156
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,778
The bastard was holding out on us!

157
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,781
Yeah, he's no newbie.

158
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,201
Wait a minute! If he's doing
something he ordinarily wouldn't,

159
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,870
that means he's been forced into it!

160
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,872
-What?
-By our little Ippo?

161
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,166
<i>You're pushing your luck!</i>

162
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,169
<i>Your face is wide open!</i>

163
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,261
What?!

164
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,021
<i>It connected! My punch connected
for the first time!</i>

165
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,816
You caught him flawlessly.

166
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,695
Back to your neutral corner!

167
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,159
Holy cow!

168
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,619
He suddenly scored a knockdown on Miyata!

169
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,456
I've never seen Miyata go down before!

170
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,460
<i>The chief's training really shows.</i>

171
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,467
I... I can do it. I can continue!

172
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,013
<i>Looks like I underestimated him.</i>

173
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,725
<i>So, he's not the same guy
I fought three months ago.</i>

174
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,560
<i>Thanks to that, I'm awake now!</i>

175
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,980
Kid, go without hesitation!

176
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,231
Right!

177
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,445
<i>I'm not dumb enough...</i>

178
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,447
<i>to fall for the same punch twice!</i>

179
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,539
Whoa! This time Ippo's down!

180
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:15,127
Don't fall for that counterpunch!
This is just like three months ago!

181
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:29,475
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

182
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:33,270
-Kid, go without hesitation!
-Right!

183
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,484
<i>I'm not dumb enough...</i>

184
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,528
<i>to fall for the same punch twice!</i>

185
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,787
Whoa! This time Ippo's down!

186
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,458
Don't fall for that counterpunch!
This is just like three months ago!

187
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:05,302
The edge of the family
heirloom counterpunch is sharp as ever.

188
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:09,807
<i>Too shallow?</i>

189
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,775
I can continue! I'm fine!

190
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,324
-Tell me I'm dreaming!
-How can he get up?!

191
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,534
Good job!

192
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,453
He's maximizing what he learned
in the past three months!

193
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,291
<i>It was shallow! The timing was bang-on...</i>

194
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,334
<i>but the pressure just wasn't solid.</i>

195
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:43,382
<i>Did I not step in deep enough?
Or did I not lure him in far enough?</i>

196
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,343
<i>Either way, I'll nail him
with my next chance!</i>

197
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,764
<i>The last time hurt
so bad I could pass out,</i>

198
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,350
<i>but this time, it wasn't so bad!</i>

199
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,189
<i>Those three months were not in vain!</i>

200
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:04,403
<i>The Chief's special anti-Miyata-kun
counterpunch training is clearly working!</i>

201
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,913
<i>Is he coming on forcefully?!</i>

202
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,249
<i>If I allow him to keep a distance,</i>

203
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,752
<i>I'll fall victim to his out-boxing!</i>

204
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,838
<i>Forward!</i>

205
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,548
<i>Forward!</i>

206
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:30,346
Ippo is stepping in so aggressively,
Miyata can't box like he usually does!

207
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:36,560
Still, it's amazing Ippo can go forward
against that powerful counterpunch.

208
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,566
You said it. If his dart
and dash slows down even slightly,

209
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,110
a counterpunch will come flying
at him like an arrow.

210
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,278
That takes courage.

211
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,492
<i>It's going to hit! It's going to hit you!</i>

212
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,620
<i>Miyata-kun flinched!</i>

213
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,875
<i>My timing is right on!
My pull-in is perfect!</i>

214
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,168
Good!

215
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,086
<i>You're mine!</i>

216
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,402
Back to your neutral corner!

217
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,153
Whoa!

218
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,906
-Amazing.
-Wow.

219
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,702
Did you see that?!

220
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,162
Yeah, it was amazing!
He scored another knock-down!

221
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,832
No, I meant right
before the counter connected!

222
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:40,833
Before?

223
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,669
He went forward on purpose
to shift the point of impact!

224
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,056
If you step forward right
before the counterpunch,

225
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,143
the opponent's arm will
still be bent during impact,

226
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,936
reducing the power of the punch by half.

227
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,896
Oh, so Ippo stepped into it!

228
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,691
He must really have
worked on his dart and dash.

229
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,693
That was an incredible counterpunch block!

230
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,612
So his dart and dash
was not just for offense,

231
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,157
but also for defense
against counterpunches!

232
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,120
<i>I can't believe the way
he blocked Ichiro's counterpunch.</i>

233
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,206
<i>It's not like the previous knock-down
where timing was a factor.</i>

234
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,667
<i>This knock-down really hit hard.</i>

235
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,669
<i>Did he win?</i>

236
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,309
-Can you go on?
-Yes.

237
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,854
Hey, Miyata's feet are wobbly.
He can hardly stay up!

238
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:47,441
Hey, if Ippo lands
one more knock-down, he'll win!

239
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,651
-He'll have KO'd Miyata?
-What?

240
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,612
This is getting exciting!

241
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:55,074
<i>I... I could win?</i>

242
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:01,121
<i>When he's at full-power, my punches
are too broad to hit Miyata-kun...</i>

243
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:06,126
<i>but now, I just might be able
to hit him while he's exhausted!</i>

244
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,130
<i>I'll use an uppercut!</i>

245
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,383
<i>This is not good.
I already have two strikes.</i>

246
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,636
<i>Calm down.</i>

247
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,264
<i>He'll definitely try to finish me.
What will he use?</i>

248
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,809
<i>Think!</i>

249
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,895
Go, kid!

250
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,063
Right!

251
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,318
Come on, go for it!

252
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,278
Great job! Hang in there!

253
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,073
<i>What's he going to use?!</i>

254
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,324
<i>Okay!</i>

255
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,784
<i>Damn it!</i>

256
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,541
<i>I lean my upper body forward,
and keep my knuckles facing up!</i>

257
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,586
<i>Extend my knees at full force,
and use the momentum...</i>

258
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,838
<i>to thrust my fist upward!</i>

259
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,840
<i>An uppercut! Should I block?!</i>

260
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,050
<i>No, intercept!</i>

261
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,156
Whoa, the tables are turned again!

262
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,869
All right!

263
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,956
Miyata showed his pride! Damn, he's good!

264
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,293
What a guy! How could
he counter a punch like that?!

265
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:34,173
He got us! I never dreamed
he'd counterpunch an uppercut!

266
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,635
<i>It's impossible to block a counterpunch
from a mid-uppercut position!</i>

267
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,888
<i>He took the brunt of it.</i>

268
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,269
<i>Can he get up?</i>

269
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,573
Kid!

270
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,337
Kid!

271
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,512
-Amazing!
-Unbelievable!

272
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,890
-How could he recover from that?!
-You're kidding!

273
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,059
All right! Good boy!

274
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,311
Now where's the gong?!

275
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,564
-Ippo, can you go on?
-Yes!

276
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,024
Miyata!

277
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,155
The first round is over!

278
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,407
Awesome, you guys!

279
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:43,951
Kid!

280
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,673
Oh, I'm getting goosebumps. Damn!

281
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:02,511
Miyata is living up to his reputation,
but Ippo's doing a great job, too!

282
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,223
What Takamura-san said earlier
may not be far from the truth after all!

283
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:10,978
A fighter boxer with the dash power
to block a counterpunch.

284
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:15,440
An out-boxer who intercepts an uppercut
even after his counterpunch is blocked.

285
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,735
Is this really a match
between two non-licensed boxers?

286
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,445
Especially that kid.

287
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,449
He might turn out
to be an incredible find.

288
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,759
Kid! Hey, kid! Come on!

289
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,686
Snap out of it, kid!

290
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,274
Chief.

291
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,525
Are you awake now?

292
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:38,041
<i>The uppercut. It makes
an attack three-dimensional.</i>

293
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,169
<i>It is an attack from below
that can threaten a skilled defense.</i>

294
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,465
<i>I don't want to fall down!
I want to continue the match!</i>

295
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,218
<i>Miyata-kun is incredible,
but I don't want it to end yet!</i>

296
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,807
<i>My most powerful weapon that
I acquired in the past three months</i>

297
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,976
<i>still might work against him!</i>

298
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,979
<i>Next time,
"The Destructive Force of 1 cm!"</i>
