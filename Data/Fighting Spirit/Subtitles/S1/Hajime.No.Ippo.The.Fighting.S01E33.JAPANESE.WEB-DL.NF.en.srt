00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,993
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,334
OSAKA PREFECTURAL GYMNASIUM

4
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,807
It's a smash!

5
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,768
<i>That was close! If I hadn't sparred
with Takamura-san,</i>

6
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,061
<i>I would've been hit!</i>

7
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,438
<i>Again!</i>

8
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,149
<i>What?!</i>

9
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,569
<i>From below?!</i>

10
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:08,378
SMASH FORCE

11
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:17,345
<i>A new and improved smash!</i>

12
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,349
What the heck was that punch?!

13
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,351
Something awesome just connected!

14
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,895
Sendo smashes!

15
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,481
However, it's different
from the previous incarnation!

16
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,358
His body hugs the ground in a wide swing!

17
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,111
It's a super-low-altitude smash!

18
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:39,200
He threw his entire body
at him as he stretched up!

19
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:42,328
Hey... The drawback of the smash is defense!

20
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,874
But he revised the thing to increase
the attack power, not the defense!

21
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,376
He would think of something like that.

22
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,878
Ippo managed to guard himself,

23
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,880
but it's got to hurt on top
of everything else.

24
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:52,881
TEAM EAST

25
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,677
<i>It got to my legs!
Even though I had my guard up.</i>

26
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,387
<i>If I had taken a direct hit</i>...

27
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,972
Finish him all the way, will you?!

28
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,640
<i>You don't have to tell me. I will!</i>

29
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,060
<i>I'm impressed that you can still move.</i>

30
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,604
<i>I meant for it to knock you out,</i>

31
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,105
<i>even with your guard up!</i>

32
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,738
Yet another smash!

33
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,740
Makunouchi flees the point of impact!

34
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,491
<i>Damn!</i>

35
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,286
<i>I'd be a goner if I took a hit from that.</i>

36
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,291
He's dodging it somehow,
but it can only go downhill at this rate!

37
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,960
Can't he do anything other than block?!

38
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,754
Well, yes, he can, but...

39
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,465
<i>I must stay away from the ropes.</i>

40
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,761
<i>Damn it!</i>

41
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,013
<i>Again!</i>

42
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,436
Oh, dear! Makunouchi throws himself
into Sendo's arms!

43
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,563
What the heck?! He's clinching!

44
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,440
Why don't you fight like a man?!

45
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,608
<i>Damn!</i>

46
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,325
Whoops! He's not clinching,
he's close-range fighting!

47
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,453
Makunouchi comes to Sendo
with a close-range fight!

48
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,704
<i>That's fine by me!</i>

49
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,709
Just like round one, both fighters stop
in their tracks and duke it out!

50
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,301
Wow, this is packed with thrills!

51
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,136
Someone will go flying!

52
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,888
The odds are even at close-range!

53
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,141
The Eastern kid is doing a great job
against Sendo!

54
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,144
Nah, Sendo has the smash in his arsenal!

55
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,647
Smash him, Sendo!

56
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,816
Heh, stupid newbies.

57
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,485
He couldn't throw a smash right now
if he wanted to.

58
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,903
What? Why not?

59
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,031
That's what Takamura-san
would call a smash-blocker.

60
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,033
At a glance, it looks dangerous,

61
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,786
but the smash is a middle-range blow.

62
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,038
With Ippo that close, Sendo can't use it.

63
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,417
Effectively, he's smothering the smash.

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,795
Wow, that's amazing!
Ippo-kun is really using his head.

65
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,339
But it's impressive to
tell all that simply by watching!

66
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,384
Aw, any boxer could see that.

67
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,802
<i>I couldn't.</i>

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,555
Oh, my! They hit
each other simultaneously!

69
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,058
However, Makunouchi took the worst of it!

70
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,311
Yet he clings on!

71
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,315
He still sticks to close-range fighting
no matter what!

72
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,734
He does not fear Sendo's powerful punch!

73
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,194
That guy has nerves of steel.

74
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,531
He's fighting with a cannon pointed
right at his face.

75
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,325
He's the enemy, but he has courage.

76
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,077
That's good! Don't give him any distance!

77
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,539
If you stick to him,
you're sure to find an opening to charge!

78
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,708
-He won't find an opening like that.
-What?

79
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,461
Right now, he's only lashing out
in desperation.

80
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,589
He's writhing under the pressure
of the knife flashing in his face,

81
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,841
a knife they call the smash.

82
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,135
So, you mean,
Ippo's fighting at close range

83
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,804
only to keep the smashes in check?

84
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,265
That's why it's so bad to
have his back to the ropes.

85
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,727
The revised smash is
a punch that comes to life at rope-side.

86
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,023
They have stopped moving.

87
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,734
Are they both taking a break
from exhaustion?

88
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,987
Or are they merely waiting for
the perfect time to strike?

89
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,330
<i>I can't give him an inch of leeway.</i>

90
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,499
<i>I have to keep trading blows
with him like this!</i>

91
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,375
<i>I have to make a stand!</i>

92
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,002
Take the initiative!

93
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,755
Don't give him a chance to hit back!
Hit him first!

94
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,757
<i>He's right. That's all I can do!</i>

95
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,345
Oh! Sendo back-steps!

96
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,097
That's a bad distance!

97
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,099
You have to get close to him!

98
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,602
<i>I won't make it in time! What'll I do?!</i>

99
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,147
<i>I know! I'll counter!</i>

100
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,441
<i>I'll match his punch
from below with a hook!</i>

101
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,401
He's countering!
Just like the Hayami match!

102
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,949
<i>No way! The smash was a feint?!</i>

103
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,701
Sendo lands a right!

104
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,540
Makunouchi blocks with his shoulder
and somehow withstands it!

105
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:59,085
But it's taken its toll.
He can't control his feet!

106
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,838
<i>He's gone!</i>

107
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,340
<i>Below!</i>

108
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,724
It grazes his cheek!
Did this have an effect?!

109
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,725
Ippo!

110
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,230
No, he's staying up!
He holds onto the rope and perseveres!

111
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,234
This is it! Sendo goes to deliver
his finishing smash!

112
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,235
Go!

113
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:25,903
This is bad!

114
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:26,904
<i>Got you!</i>

115
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,911
The bell has rung, both of you!

116
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,414
Now, return to your corners!

117
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,547
Round two is over!

118
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,007
Unlike the first round,

119
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,010
this time Makunouchi is saved by the bell!

120
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,179
What an extreme series of developments!

121
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:55,475
This is definitely a main event worthy of
the All-Japan Rookie Championship!

122
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:59,687
Oh, darn! Ippo-kun is trying so hard too!

123
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,522
Isn't there any way he can win this?

124
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,066
The smash is pressuring him so bad

125
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,319
that he can't help
going into defensive mode.

126
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,987
Oh, I know!

127
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,573
How about if Ippo fights back
using a smash?

128
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,241
It would sure scare off Sendo!

129
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,826
What are you talking about?!

130
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,329
You can't just go and photocopy
a move like that!

131
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,622
Hold on a second.

132
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:21,125
The problem is, the smash prevents him
from using middle-range fighting, right?

133
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,377
<i>Ippo only uses close-range</i>

134
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,879
<i>because it's convenient, so...</i>

135
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:29,175
So if he could only use a middle-range
blow that could oppose the smash,

136
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,635
he could shake the pressure,

137
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,387
and take it back into
close-range fighting, right?

138
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,891
In Ippo's repertoire of punches...

139
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,227
In Ippo's repertoire of punches?

140
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,104
It's no good! I can't think of anything!

141
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,648
Ow!

142
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,649
What's your problem?

143
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,359
Don't raise our hopes for nothing!

144
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,528
This is a real fix.

145
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,531
Good going, Sendo, you're doing fine.

146
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,824
Makunouchi is really hurting now!

147
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,076
It's no good.

148
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,079
He's not the type to give up
after a trifle like that.

149
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,582
Through all his grogginess,
just before the bell rang,

150
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,793
he was attempting something new.

151
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,006
So, we don't know what could happen
if this drags on, huh?

152
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,007
Very well!

153
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,010
If you see a window in the next round,
go for it!

154
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:13,928
Press him hard!

155
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,056
Save your breath.
That was already the plan!

156
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,852
<i>The kid, who's a storehouse of stamina,</i>

157
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,855
<i>is this run-down after only two rounds.</i>

158
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,066
<i>Our method of attack is sound!</i>

159
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,318
<i>His counter wasn't a bad move.</i>

160
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,114
<i>Still, each blow puts him further behind.</i>

161
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,283
<i>To think he would use his secret weapon</i>

162
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,034
<i>as a feint of all things.</i>

163
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,119
<i>No</i>...

164
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,706
{\an8}<i>It was effective
because it's a secret weapon.</i>

165
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:46,335
{\an8}<i>I suppose a first-rate fighter
has a stockpile of first-rate severity.</i>

166
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,838
<i>This match has become a little too much</i>

167
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,132
<i>for the kid at his stage of development.</i>

168
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,466
Ippo-kun!

169
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,052
Ippo-kun, gargle! And sit yourself down.

170
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,389
What's wrong? Sit down already.

171
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,641
You need as much rest as possible.

172
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,269
I... I think I'll stand... if you don't mind.

173
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,355
But why? You didn't sit
after the first round either.

174
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,027
I feel like once I sit down...

175
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,279
I won't be able to get to my feet again.

176
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:17,366
My body is still moving,
but I took some hard hits.

177
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,829
But I want to keep at it a little longer.

178
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:26,375
Because... I came here
because I wanted to fight him.

179
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,504
Besides, there's still one thing
I need to do!

180
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,010
Seconds out!

181
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,346
Chief, my mouthpiece.

182
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,014
Right.

183
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,518
Are you sure about this, Chief?

184
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,355
Do you want to send him in
without any advice?

185
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,774
He has one thing left to do, eh?

186
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,733
What?

187
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,277
In this hopeless downhill battle,

188
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,073
the guy has the nerve to say
he's got unfinished business.

189
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,784
I've heard that phrase from him before.

190
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,916
There's still one more thing I need to do.

191
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,753
<i>He used the exact words he used back then.</i>

192
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,090
<i>I'll let the kid have this round.</i>

193
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,051
<i>I'd like to see
this unfinished business of his!</i>

194
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,055
Round three!

195
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:30,272
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

196
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,275
Now, this is the important round.

197
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,028
Will Sendo proceed to
launch an all-out attack?

198
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,739
Or will Makunouchi counterattack?

199
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,783
This is positively riveting!

200
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,077
It ends this round!

201
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,704
Damn straight! You get him, Sendo!

202
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,289
<i>Aw, damn it!</i>

203
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,000
<i>I can't be squelched
by the people around me anymore!</i>

204
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,170
<i>Wait right there, Ippo!
I'll get the party started for you!</i>

205
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,464
Huh?

206
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,549
What's wrong?

207
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,050
Have you seen my drum anywhere?

208
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,678
I think I dropped it or something...

209
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,932
Rocky!

210
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,934
Why, you snotty brats!

211
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,688
Rocky!

212
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,191
We'll clap for him.

213
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,151
Umezawa-san...

214
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,319
The contenders stare
each other down yet again.

215
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,156
And as they lock eyes,
the distance begins to shrink away!

216
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,662
Hey... What are you thinking, Ippo?!

217
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,498
He took up position in middle range,
of all the stupid places!

218
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,667
Isn't he going to stick close and fight?

219
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:36,172
<i>This distance is in my favor!
I'll rip your head off with my smash!</i>

220
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,548
Ippo-kun?!

221
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,674
Kid...

222
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,678
<i>Looks like he's ready for it.</i>

223
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:49,185
My word! Now Makunouchi has thrown
his peek-a-boo stance to the wind!

224
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,896
What kind of strategy is this?!

225
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,897
<i>Kid!</i>

226
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,399
What is he thinking?!

227
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,861
Normally, he should tighten his guard
and wait for his second wind!

228
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,490
If he lowers his right guard,
he'll take the smash head-on!

229
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,699
-Hey...
-What?

230
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,912
His right and left are different,
but doesn't that pose look familiar?

231
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,914
Ippo lowered his right guard,

232
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,416
and Sendo lowered his left guard.

233
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,792
You're right.

234
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,796
Their right and left fists
are mirror reflections.

235
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,466
It's the same pose as Sendo?!

236
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,759
Don't tell me...

237
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,427
<i>Don't tell me, you...</i>

238
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,180
<i>You're not going to mimic my smash,
are you?!</i>

239
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,432
<i>Why, you!</i>

240
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,392
Now he's pissed!

241
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,769
How could he not be?!

242
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:32,978
The smash isn't something

243
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,481
you can accomplish
without tons of heavy training!

244
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,943
If a guy takes your pose when
he's never done it before, it's insulting!

245
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,197
<i>What's with these wimpy jabs?</i>

246
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,699
<i>Is he gauging distance?!</i>

247
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,619
<i>Do you think you can simply
throw something like a smash overnight?!</i>

248
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,579
<i>That's not only insulting, that's absurd!</i>

249
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,709
Sendo launches a series of attacks!

250
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,212
Is Makunouchi pressed to stay alive?

251
00:13:59,046 --> 00:13:59,964
<i>A right?!</i>

252
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,967
<i>An uppercut?! No!</i>

253
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,052
<i>His wrist is straight!</i>

254
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,720
<i>A straight?! Angled from below?</i>

255
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:08,931
<i>Oh, crap!</i>

256
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,356
Sendo stumbles!

257
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,569
Makunouchi hits him with
an uppercut angled from below.

258
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,988
In other words, a smash?!

259
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,116
What?! Makunouchi can do those too?!

260
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,118
That's a crazy, sharp punch!

261
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,912
<i>No, it's slightly different from a smash!</i>

262
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,415
<i>His is more upward-angled and pull-away
compared to</i>

263
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,125
<i>Sendo's round-swinging punch!</i>

264
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,418
Holy cow.

265
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,587
When did he acquire
a middle blow like that?

266
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,754
I've never seen it!

267
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,216
He can't throw something like
that from the peek-a-boo stance.

268
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,759
That's why he lowered his right!

269
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:50,431
It's amazing he pulled off a punch
like that without practice at this stage.

270
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,765
He had a lot of faith in it.

271
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,270
After all, that's the punch
he beat Miyata with.

272
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,859
I bet he's been thinking about it non-stop

273
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,777
since watching me spar with Sendo.

274
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,449
Chief, down to the words and the deed,
it's the re-enactment of that fight!

275
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,993
The kid's really done it this time.

276
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,705
Go! Don't rest your hands! Keep hammering!

277
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,582
<i>Okay!</i>

278
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,919
<i>But it's been so long since I've used it,
my image is a little off.</i>

279
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,087
<i>When I fought Miyata-kun, it was more...</i>

280
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,801
<i>I'm surprised. He has
a very similar punch.</i>

281
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,011
<i>However...</i>

282
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,012
<i>Right!</i>

283
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,306
<i>I have more destructive power!</i>

284
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,059
<i>-A throw-away punch!
-Take that!</i>

285
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,561
Oh, my! Sendo launches another smash!

286
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,398
It's a hit-for-hit!

287
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,819
Sendo stabilizes!
Makunouchi also takes it!

288
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,321
I take it back! He's feeling it!

289
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,322
Kid!

290
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,578
<i>I don't care! I'm better
at hit-for-hitting!</i>

291
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,831
<i>I have to remember!
With Miyata-kun, it was more...</i>

292
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,585
<i>It was more compact!</i>

293
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,171
<i>Like this!</i>

294
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,687
Makunouchi lands a right!
It's a powerful hit!

295
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,605
All right!

296
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,148
He blew away Sendo!

297
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,152
It's reversal after reversal!

298
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,655
However, will this end it all?

299
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,073
It connected!

300
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,075
It looked like
they punched at the same time,

301
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,662
but Ippo's hit faster
because it was straighter.

302
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,788
Wasn't that great?

303
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,166
The punch he used on Miyata
is now his counterpunch!

304
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,420
<i>I felt a solid impact. Don't get up!</i>

305
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,425
Sendo!

306
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,013
The huge cheering squad watches
over him with bated breath!

307
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,431
Can Sendo stand?!

308
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,686
<i>He can't stand. He can't possibly stand!</i>

309
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,189
Sendo doesn't twitch a muscle!
Did that settle it?!

310
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,316
Rocky...

311
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,071
Get up, Rocky!

312
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,365
Rocky, get up!

313
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,325
-Get up or else!
-Rocky?!

314
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,786
Rocky!

315
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,332
Oh, my! Sendo responds!
His upper torso rises from the mat!

316
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,584
<i>It can't be.</i>

317
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:27,588
Ro-o-cky!

318
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:31,592
Ro-o-cky!

319
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,109
Sendo bites on his mouthpiece
and attempts to stand!

320
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,113
Will he stand? Can he stand?!

321
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,202
He stumbles towards the referee!
His legs are unsteady!

322
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,119
<i>Sendo!</i>

323
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,621
<i>Sendo-san...</i>

324
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,793
Rocky!

325
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,088
He's up!

326
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,965
Sendo has risen
to his feet in a fighting pose!

327
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,801
He has come back to life!

328
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,933
<i>He got up. What a guy!</i>

329
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,812
<i>This... man is the real Sendo-san!</i>

330
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,232
That's right! That's our Rocky of Naniwa!

331
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,527
We're counting on you, Rocky!
Give it back to him!

332
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,741
<i>That one really hurt.</i>

333
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,577
<i>The cheering sounds
like a ringing in my ears.</i>

334
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,913
What the hell is wrong with you, Rocky?!

335
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,039
Fight harder!

336
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,584
You promised to buy us
video games, remember?!

337
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,295
<i>I can hear the brats quite clearly.</i>

338
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,006
<i>Risking my life to buy video games.</i>

339
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,968
<i>Damn, what a stupid promise that was.</i>

340
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,223
<i>It isn't stupid whatsoever.</i>

341
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:07,020
<i>It's hard to come across someone
with such awesome punches.</i>

342
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,481
<i>This is a valuable experience for me!</i>

343
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,528
<i>How many guys in Japan
can let me sample this thrill?</i>

344
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,907
<i>This is what Sendo-san is all about.</i>

345
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:23,537
<i>We each threw our best punches,
and he still gets back on his feet.</i>

346
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,624
<i>My boxing with Sendo-san
is only just beginning.</i>

347
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,377
<i>This is only the beginning
of our real fight!</i>

348
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,381
Ro-o-cky!

349
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,425
Again, the audience calls Rocky.

350
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,887
Can Sendo respond to
the crowd's expectations?

351
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,305
Go, Ippo!

352
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,640
If you knock him down again, you win!

353
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,267
<i>Sendo</i>...

354
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,352
Stay calm, and go finish it up!

355
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:53,609
<i>I know you like Rocky,
but my Rocky is Rocky Marciano!</i>

356
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:58,113
<i>Sendo-san once told me
that the boxer with the superior power</i>

357
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,867
<i>is the boxer who can
withstand the most punches.</i>

358
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,244
<i>This is a boxing</i>...

359
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,495
<i>...challenge!</i>

360
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,707
A sudden hit-for-hit!

361
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,796
<i>-Damn it.</i>
-Sendo falters! Is the damage serious?

362
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,048
<i>I'm going all in!</i>

363
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,761
Sendo strikes back with a mighty right!

364
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,597
Makunouchi falters! Is it a reversal?!

365
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,850
No, Sendo also staggers from the hit!

366
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,539
This is an incredible exchange of blows!

367
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,124
They both have their shields down!

368
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,002
Makunouchi gives it back!

369
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,964
And Sendo sends it back!

370
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,131
Damn it!

371
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,594
Another hit-for-hit!

372
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,849
Their fists never stop,
and the body blows keep flying!

373
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,352
The punches from both boxers
are so powerful,

374
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,854
that it reverberates throughout
the stadium!

375
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,859
Go! Don't get out-punched!

376
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,321
Stand your ground, Ippo!

377
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,364
You're almost there!

378
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,117
Right on!

379
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,869
Right on!

380
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,623
Listen to this intense cheering!

381
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,878
The intense punching battle
does the cheers justice!

382
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,636
It's a virtual test of endurance,
a test of punching power!

383
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,389
It's a test of life-and-death tenacity!

384
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,642
<i>What an amazing guy Sendo-san is!</i>

385
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,061
<i>But I won't give up first!</i>

386
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,896
<i>I must hit back for all I'm worth!</i>

387
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,899
<i>This is cool! This is so cool!</i>

388
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,903
<i>This is it! I've been wanting
to do this forever, Makunouchi!</i>

<i>Rush. The act of constantly attacking</i>

through a match that's gone stagnant,</i>
