00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,458
{\an8}I hope we get a big catch today!

4
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,708
{\an8}-Are they biting?
-Hope they like the bait.

5
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,875
Alley-oop.

6
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:42,333
Mom, I'll take care of this.
You take care of our customers.

7
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,125
Really? Then I'll leave this to you.

8
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,000
Here we go!

9
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:51,291
We're so sorry.
We'll get it ready right away.

10
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,250
We know where the boat is.
We'll go ahead on our own.

11
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,833
Really? Sorry about that.

12
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,583
-Lugworms.
-Here!

13
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,625
-Tackle box.
-Here!

14
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,250
-Now bring those out.
-Sure!

{\an8}‪SHOIN HIGH SCHOOL

18
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,458
Hey! Who wants to go see a movie?

19
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,000
-They're showing a good one.
-I'll go!

20
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,916
Yes, I want to see it, too!

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,875
Okay, that's Aikawa and Norimitsu.
Who else?

22
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,125
-Me.
-Okay.

23
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,500
We still have one more.
It doesn't matter who.

24
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,791
Hey, why don't you come with us,
Makunouchi-kun?

25
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:26,125
What? You mean I can go with you guys?

26
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,791
Don't be shy.

27
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,125
We all just changed classrooms
so we're all strangers.

28
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,666
Oh, yeah! Okay, I'd love to... Oh.

29
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,250
<i>I forgot. We have a reservation
for night fishing tonight.</i>

30
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:42,291
-What's the matter?
-Uh, I'm sorry.

31
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,666
We run a fishing boat business
and it's just my mother.

32
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,333
I have to help out again tonight.

33
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,291
Really? That's too bad.

34
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,041
Maybe next time!

35
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,375
Aikawa-san, let's get going!

36
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,208
Coming!

37
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:05,125
He turned me down the other day too.
What a buzzkill!

38
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:09,375
Oh, yeah. He was being harassed
by some scary-looking guys the other day.

39
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,958
Maybe he's an easy target.

40
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:32,000
<i>They expressly invited me to come,</i>

41
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,333
<i>so why do I have to be so clumsy?</i>

42
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,583
<i>I wonder if I should be more outgoing?</i>

43
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,791
<i>But there's no way I can ignore
our family business.</i>

44
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,208
-Hey, Ippo!
-Huh?

45
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,958
Hey!

46
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,250
Oh, Umezawa-kun! Please, after you!

47
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,250
Huh? Hey, does something smell bad?

48
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,125
Hey, you're right.
Something does indeed smell bad.

49
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,750
Huh? What could it be?

50
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,291
It's you! You smell like worms!

51
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,500
Can't you tell?

52
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:20,458
The stench of worms is all over you
because you fiddle with them every day!

53
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:24,500
I'm sorry! They're a part
of my family's business

54
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,875
so I can't help it.

55
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,583
I'm sick of it!

56
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,916
When you come to school,
the whole place smells like earthworms.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Actually, they're not earthworms.
They're lugworms.

58
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,583
Who do you think you are?!
Who asked you to correct me?!

59
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,833
<i>Why do you hit me, Umezawa-kun?</i>

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,458
<i>Is it fun to pick on those
who are weaker than you?</i>

61
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,916
If her son is this smelly,

62
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,958
I bet your mother smells like crap.

63
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,708
Damn!

64
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,208
Why are you looking at me like that?

65
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,458
Well?!

66
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,166
Nothing.

67
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:26,458
Why don't you show me
some guts once in a while?!

68
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,208
Oh, man. This is pretty gruesome.

69
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,458
These punks don't look so tough to me.

70
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,625
Who the hell are you?

71
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,875
Don't try to show off, moron.

72
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:45,958
What?!

73
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:53,458
You're the one who's showing off!

74
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,458
Ow... ouch.

75
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,125
Are you guys
supposed to be an electric fan?

76
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,500
Just because you're a little quick,
don't get carried away!

77
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,750
Who's getting carried away? You or me?

78
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,750
Uh, well, um...

79
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,625
-You'll pay for this!
-Damn it!

80
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,208
Amazing.

81
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,416
Hey! Wake up!

82
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,125
Come on, wake up!

83
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,291
What?

84
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,125
Big Guy, he's awake!

85
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:36,500
-Hey, are you all right?
-Uh, yes.

86
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,041
Where am I?

87
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,291
This your first time in a boxing gym?

88
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,708
Boxing gym?

89
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,458
Yeah. I brought you here

90
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,666
because we're equipped
with first aid supplies.

91
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,000
Thank you for your help!

92
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,916
I really, really appreciate it!

93
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:00,416
That's enough thanks.
If you feel better, hurry on home.

94
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,916
I hate bastards who prey on the weak,

95
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,750
but I am disgusted
with those who just get bullied

96
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,666
and don't even try to fight back!

97
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,916
I bet your mother smells like crap.

98
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,375
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

99
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,666
-Wait a minute!
-Huh?

100
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,458
Man! You're frustrated enough to cry.

101
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,916
Hold on. I'll let you try something fun.

102
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,916
All right. Pretend this is that bastard
and take a swing at him!

103
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,416
What? But it doesn't look like...

104
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,458
Shut up and do it!
It'll make you feel better.

105
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,625
Yes, sir!

106
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,166
If you insist, uh...

107
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,666
Does it go like this?

108
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,666
There. Ow!

109
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,791
If you're pissed off,
use everything you got on it!

110
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes, sir!

111
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,666
-What're you shouting about, Big Guy?
-Shut up. It's nothing.

112
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,666
Everything I've got.

113
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,875
That's it. That's the spirit.

114
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,166
See? Doesn't he
look like he's in pain now?

115
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,958
Try to step into it harder.

116
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,166
Step into it, sir?

117
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,916
The moment you step into it,
lock it in with your hip.

118
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,666
Also, try to twist your shoulder inward.

119
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,041
Right!

120
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,041
Step in, hip...

121
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,791
Shoulder!

122
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,791
Okay.

123
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,416
<i>Huh?</i>

124
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,541
That feels great!

125
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,416
I did it like you told me,
and it swung up that high!

126
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,666
Did you see it? Did you?!

127
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,958
It really does feel great!
It's so invigorating!

128
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,666
Ow.

129
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,166
-Get over here!
-Ow!

130
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:36,083
Did you see his knuckles?
The skin was peeling off.

131
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:40,250
You mean like a typical hard puncher?
Him? Couldn't be.

{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

134
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,416
Sandbags are hard, aren't they?

135
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,291
All done.

136
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,500
What the heck are you doing?!

137
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:16,958
You're a lot stronger than you look, kid.

138
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,166
-Do you play any kind of sport?
-Not really.

139
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:25,333
I'm too busy helping out at home
to have any time to be on a team.

140
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,541
We rent out fishing boats, you see,
so my mornings are full too.

141
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:34,041
Anyway, you seem to have a better feel
for punches than I expected.

142
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,666
Why don't you try
to flatten those suckers next time?

143
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,958
No way, I couldn't do that!

144
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,833
I'd get knocked out for sure!

145
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,250
You won't know that unless you try!

146
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:48,166
An ordinary person wouldn't be
standing after a punch like that one.

147
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,375
But I've never been in a fist fight.

148
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:58,291
Besides, like you already saw,
I'm always the one who gets bullied.

149
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,375
If you don't do anything about it,
everything will stay the same.

150
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,416
Huh?

151
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,666
Are you okay with that?

152
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,208
It's not that I'm okay with it...

153
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,375
Oops. It's time. Got to go.

154
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,708
What? Where are you going?

155
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,000

Well, everyone,
let me escort you to the boat.

161
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,333
I'm home! Sorry I'm late.

162
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,833
Welcome home. Oh? What happened to you?

163
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,041
-Where did you get all those injuries?
-Uh, it's nothing.

164
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,375
Hey, am I making you too busy
at home to make friends?

165
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,666
Are you being bullied?

166
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,833
Not at all! I'll help you right away.

167
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,333
Hey, those have ice in them.
Are you going to carry all of them?

168
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,833
Come on, everyone. It's this way!

169
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,541
Please watch your feet. The boat rocks.

170
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:26,250
I heard the tide is good today.
You'll get a big catch, for sure!

171
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,833
I'm sorry to make you
help me all the time.

172
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,125
But you're still only in high school.

173
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:36,875
You can leave the business to me
and do whatever you want to do, okay?

174
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,708
Uh, right.

Have a nice trip!

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

177
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,625
<i>I'm the one who should apologize.</i>

178
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,583
I bet your mother smells like crap.

{\an8}Makunouchi!

191
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,708
Whoa.

192
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,666
-Makunouchi!
-Yes, sir!

193
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,208
Low kick!

Dragon Screw!

195
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,541
{\an8}Ouch.

196
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,083
{\an8}The Dragon's too dangerous!

197
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,291
{\an8}Okay, I'll give you a head lock
instead of a Figure Four leg lock!

198
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,083
{\an8}They're wrestling and fighting again.

199
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,583
{\an8}I don't like that stuff.

200
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,875
{\an8}Why do guys like sweaty,
stinky stuff like that so much?

201
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,500
{\an8}Boxing is kind of dark and depressing too.

202
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,916
{\an8}Yeah, no kidding.

203
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,416
You... shouldn't make fun of boxing!

204
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,125
-Huh?
-Back Drop!

205
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,416
He's not off the floor!

206
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,541
Uh, I got carried away.

207
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,166
Uh, good morning!

208
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,875
Oh, it's you! Did you watch the videos?

209
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,375
I did! Over and over!

210
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,416
Thank you so much, Takamura-san.

211
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,041
How do you know my name?

212
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,208
{\an8}-From this.
-Oh.

213
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,708
That's amazing.

214
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,958
Imagine being the rookie king of the pros.

215
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,041
No wonder you're so strong.

216
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,666
{\an8}That's so cool!

217
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,750
{\an8}Ha! Of course I'm cool,

218
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,666
{\an8}but I'm not giving out
autographs right now.

219
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,708
{\an8}I'll sign it for you at the gym.

220
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,875
{\an8}Do you think I can do boxing too?

221
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:40,375
{\an8}I'd like to learn boxing too.

222
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,625
Huh?

223
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:45,625
Well, uh, I thought
I'd like to become a boxer too.

224
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,208
Boxing is no sport for a wimp like you!

225
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:54,166
But I could get you
a "Workout for Dieting" or something.

226
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,166
Would that be good?

227
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,916
Well, uh, that's not what I...
That's not what I meant.

228
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,916
{\an8}I want to become a professional boxer.

229
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,416
{\an8}I want to be strong and fight in matches!

230
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,375
Takamura-san,
you said I had a feel for it, so...

231
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,666
-Don't mock boxing.
-What?

232
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:24,166
I don't appreciate your decision to
become a boxer on a whim like it's easy!

233
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,875
It's not a whim!
I gave it serious thought!

234
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:35,208
It's no world where a bullied mincemeat
like you could survive!

235
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,291
I gave it serious thought.

236
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,625
I seriously decided to start boxing.

237
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,166
I'm determined!

238
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,250
I want to be strong like you,
Takamura-san!

239
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,666
I want to be a new person!

240
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:05,500
Takamura-san, what does it mean
to be strong?

241
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:09,666
How does it feel to be strong?

242
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,958
All right.

243
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,666
Come with me!

244
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,666
So, you want to be like me, do you?
Watch closely!

245
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,416
What?

246
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,166
Come over here.

247
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:59,166
-Do what I just did.
-You mean me?

248
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,125
If you manage to do this,
I'll teach you some boxing.

249
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,208
Can I pull something like that off?

250
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:33,916
<i>The jab.</i>

251
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,916
<i>The most basic skill in boxing
and one that a boxer must acquire first.</i>

252
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,541
<i>The jab measures distance, acts as a wall...</i>

253
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,916
<i>and creates a window for attack.</i>

254
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,041
<i>Quickly and sharply!</i>

255
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,791
<i>I won't give up. I'll never give up!</i>

256
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:53,583
<i>I'll achieve my dream.
I'll become a new person no matter what!</i>

257
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,583
<i>Next time, "Fruits of Labor."</i>
