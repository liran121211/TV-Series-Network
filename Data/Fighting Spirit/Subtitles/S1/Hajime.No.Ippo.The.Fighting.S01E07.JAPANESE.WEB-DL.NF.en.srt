ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,583
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,708
Kid!

4
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,625
-Ippo, can you go on?
-Yes.

5
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:47,000
Miyata!

6
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,791
The first round is over!

7
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,000
Awesome, you guys!

8
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:57,041
Is this really a match
between two non-licensed boxers?

9
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:01,291
Kid! Hey, kid! Wake up!

10
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,208
Snap out of it, kid!

11
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,708
Chief.

12
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,541
Are you awake now?

13
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:37,666
THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCE OF 1 CM

14
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:47,541
Too bad. You were able to
counter his long uppercut, but...

15
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,333
Damn!

16
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:58,458
That right straight I took earlier
made my feet weak.

17
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,541
If I could have stood firmer,

18
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,750
that last punch
would have finished him off.

19
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:09,041
He's practically a different person
from who he was three months ago.

20
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,166
Starting with the second round,
I'll fight him as though he's at my level!

21
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,416
If I don't watch it,
I'll be the one who loses!

22
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,291
Ichiro.

23
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,416
You each have got two knock-downs.
You're fighting at his level.

24
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,083
In... Incredible.

25
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,000
Miyata-kun really is incredible.

26
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:36,041
I can't believe he could save that...

27
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,791
that awesome attack
until the very last minute.

28
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,583
<i>That must have hurt bad.
I hope he's not emotionally crushed</i>

29
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:49,125
<i>from having the tables turned
when he was so close to victory.</i>

30
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,875
Anyway, I'm glad you're back!

31
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,916
But...

32
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,500
I hit him.

33
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,333
Last time, I couldn't touch him,

34
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,833
but I've knocked him down twice now!

35
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:07,375
The last three months
of training has been tough,

36
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,166
but right now, I'm so happy it's unreal!

37
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:16,958
If I could, I'd love to get up again
and again and keep fighting forever.

38
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:20,083
A great fighter like Miyata-kun
is taking me seriously enough

39
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,708
to use a secret weapon on me!

40
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,250
I can't afford to just lay around!

41
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,041
<i>What a kid.</i>

42
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,666
They're both at the same level of damage.

43
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,416
Ippo may have
blocked Miyata's counterpunch,

44
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,750
but Miyata took advantage of
Ippo's long uppercut for his counterpunch.

45
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,916
They blocked each other's Sunday punches,
making them totally on par.

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,416
No. I think the odds are against the kid.

47
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,375
If neither can use their best punches,
it won't end with a single punch.

48
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:54,000
Which means, whoever
delivers the most punches will win.

49
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,375
Which means...

50
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,291
All right.

51
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,125
Let's start the second round!

52
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,583
-Whoa! Ippo unleashed one!
-How will Miyata react?

53
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,041
<i>What's this?!</i>

54
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,500
He's clinching?

55
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,541
Hey, it's not like Miyata to clinch.

56
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,875
What's going on?

57
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,416
<i>Miyata-kun is clinching? Why?!</i>

58
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,416
Break it up! Don't stand still, Miyata!

59
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,666
<i>Miyata-kun, why?!</i>

60
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,208
Break it up! Get away from him, Miyata!

61
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,125
I get it.

62
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,416
<i>Miyata is clever.</i>

63
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,583
The second round is over! To your corners!

64
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:32,458
<i>Something's wrong. I thought
that Miyata-kun wasn't the type to run.</i>

65
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,541
<i>So why?</i>

66
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,875
Do you get it now?

67
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,708
Miyata gave up attacking this round

68
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,958
to focus on recuperating from any damage.

69
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,625
His longer boxing experience shows.

70
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,708
At the start of the round,
he was heaving his shoulders,

71
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,375
but now his breathing
is already back to normal.

72
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,625
In the remaining two rounds,
he'll come on strong!

73
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,958
<i>It's not that Miyata isn't proud.
In fact, he's the proud type.</i>

74
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,625
<i>He's doing whatever he can to win.</i>

75
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,791
<i>I can tell he's dead serious.</i>

76
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:19,125
<i>Still, it's unbelievable that Miyata
was driven into a corner so quickly.</i>

77
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:25,041
He's still dragging his feet
from the damage in the first round.

78
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:29,166
But as long as he charges aggressively,
your counterpunch will remain blocked.

79
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,875
How do you intend to beat him?

80
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:34,125
If I can stop his feet,
he won't be able to step forward.

81
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,833
-Oh?
-That's what clinching is for.

82
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,625
I'll nail him in the next round.
Watch me, Dad!

83
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,125
<i>My feet are back to normal.</i>

84
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,583
<i>The look in his eye has changed!</i>

85
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,333
<i>What'll I do?! Don't hesitate!</i>

86
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,416
<i>No matter what,
all I can do is go forward!</i>

87
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,291
<i>Here I come!</i>

88
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,958
Miyata has changed
the style of his attacks!

89
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,291
His feet are moving light and swift!

90
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,666
He's using hit-and-away.

91
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,250
You jump in and attack quickly,

92
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,791
and by the time
your opponent strikes back, you're gone.

93
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:45,375
Though not many of those punches
will lead to a single KO punch,

94
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,333
it will definitely pile on the damage.

95
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,416
It's a textbook example of out-boxing.

96
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,041
<i>Ichiro!</i>

97
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,291
He's focusing on body blows.

98
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,791
No matter how strong Ippo's body is,

99
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,333
he can't withstand that kind of barrage.

100
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:15,083
The kid is still reeling from
his damage in the first round.

101
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:19,958
He's totally helpless against
that incredible hit-and-away technique.

102
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,875
-Oh, no!
-Ippo's feet stopped!

103
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,583
Miyata's tactics won out!

104
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:39,083
As long as Miyata can stop Ippo's
forward motion, he has nothing to fear.

105
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,791
This is where their difference
in experience clearly shows.

106
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,791
<i>More!</i>

107
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,583
<i>I want to keep standing more!</i>

108
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,208
<i>Miyata-kun is taking me seriously!</i>

109
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,666
<i>There's still one more round left!</i>

110
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,166
How do you like that?!

111
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,041
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

112
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,625
To your neutral corner!

113
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,416
He won't get up from that.

114
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,791
Guess I'll grab Miyata's comments
and get going.

115
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,166
He's still going to fight?!

116
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,250
That's the bell! The third round is over!

117
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,916
Whoa, awesome!

118
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,250
They're fired up!

119
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,583
Saved by the bell.

120
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,083
They took it all the way
to the final round.

121
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:41,250
<i>Yeah, the kid is doing
a great job against Miyata.</i>

122
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,833
<i>But the result is obvious now.
It's impossible to turn the tables.</i>

123
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,458
That was good footwork.

124
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:53,083
Still, I've never seen you
make a victory pose before.

125
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,958
I'm surprised at it myself.

126
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,583
Every one of his punches
is potentially fatal.

127
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,875
I can't let myself take even one.

128
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,208
I love this kind of tension.

129
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,125
That's what you need.
In the professional ring,

130
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,208
the pressure of "beat-or-beaten"
is always with you.

131
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,708
Unless you overcome the pressure,
you can't become a real pro!

132
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,375
<i>I need to thank the Chief.</i>

133
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,916
<i>He's given good experience to my son.</i>

134
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,541
The way you're fighting,

135
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,375
it's only a matter of time
before you score a KO.

136
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:30,250
However, he'll be going after
a reversal like nobody's business.

137
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,708
Watch out for his uppercut.

138
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,791
I already have a perfect grasp
of his uppercut.

139
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,166
If he keeps trying to throw it,
I'll finish him with my counterpunch!

140
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:46,125
You can hardly breathe
through that bloody nose.

141
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,458
I'm amazed you got back on your feet!

142
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,958
However, your charging feet
have been taken away

143
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,041
and his counterpunch has
your finishing blow uppercut in check.

144
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,875
You're out of tricks.

145
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,875
So, do you want to give up now?

146
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,708
Even if you go on to the next round,

147
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,416
he'll only use you as a punching bag.

148
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:15,333
I was content at first,
just to get close to him.

149
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:20,166
I've already been able to do
more than what I thought I could.

150
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,708
But since I've come this far,
I want to go a little farther.

151
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,625
Since I'm already fighting,
I think that I'd like to win.

152
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,458
Is that... strange?

153
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,500
<i>This kid's been taking a thrashing,</i>

154
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,291
<i>but he's still thinking like that?!</i>

155
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,250
<i>But it's so obvious that
he'll be beaten to a bloody pulp.</i>

156
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:43,541
<i>Should I let a kid who hasn't
even debuted as a pro yet do this?!</i>

157
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,083
Kid, are you going to go for it?

158
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:51,791
Yes, I am.

159
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,083
There's still one more thing I need to do.

160
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:04,041
All right, go out there and
show me what you've left undone!

161
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,083
Right!

162
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,458
Go finish up, Ichiro!

163
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,833
All right!

164
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,916
Last round! Round Four!

165
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,916
-Go for it, Miyata!
-Don't back down, Ippo!

166
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,083
Here it comes!

167
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,458
Miyata took the initiative!

168
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,583
He went over Ippo's guard from
the right, forcing him into the ropes!

169
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
<i>You won't get away!</i>

170
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,333
It's Operation Turtle.

171
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,125
Ippo's gone and reverted back
to how he was three months ago!

172
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,500
<i>He's determined to finish it
by knock-out, no matter what.</i>

173
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,250
<i>The barrage of punches is
so overwhelming, I can't do anything!</i>

174
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,291
<i>I have to be strong until it subsides!</i>

175
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,541
<i>When is it going to subside?</i>

176
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,125
His guard is wearing down.
The KO is only a matter of time.

177
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:08,250
If this keeps up, he's going to lose
before he uses whatever he left undone.

178
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,458
Is this it?!

179
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,833
<i>I won. This is the end!</i>

180
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,625
<i>The barrage has stopped!</i>

181
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,333
<i>The motion is small!
It must be a right straight!</i>

182
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,666
<i>I'll dodge to the left!</i>

183
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,416
<i>What?! Is that an uppercut?!</i>

184
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,916
<i>A short uppercut without motion!</i>

185
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,166
<i>So that's what the kid was aiming for!</i>

186
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,625
<i>How could he still produce
a punch like that in his condition?!</i>

187
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,583
<i>That was so close!</i>

188
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,791
<i>I couldn't predict him
like I could before.</i>

189
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,291
<i>You made me break into a cold sweat!</i>

190
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,541
<i>I missed! I'm done for!</i>

191
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,250
What? Why?

192
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,250
Why did Miyata fall? Did he slip?

193
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,250
To your neutral corner!

194
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,916
What? Down?!

195
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,500
Did that connect?

196
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,416
<i>It didn't miss it!</i>

197
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,250
<i>That uppercut grazed
the end of Miyata's chin!</i>

198
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,708
<i>What a waste of a knock-down!</i>

199
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,166
<i>A motionless uppercut, huh?</i>

200
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,250
<i>It was impossible to anticipate
an uppercut from that position.</i>

201
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,500
All right already. I'm getting up.

202
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,583
What's wrong, Ichiro?!

203
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,625
How can this be?

204
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:16,041
Wait! I'm getting up.

205
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,791
Wait, please! I can go on!

206
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,916
I said I can go on! Didn't you hear me?!

207
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,916
Damn it!

208
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,541
What? Huh?

209
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,416
Huh? What?

210
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,791
Ippo wins!

211
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,708
-That was awesome!
-Wow!

212
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,708
-He won!
-Can you believe it?!

213
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,083
What?

214
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,833
This can't be happening!
Ippo ended up winning!

215
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,125
He won against Miyata with a KO!
I don't believe it!

216
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,583
Uh... Miyata-kun!

217
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,083
Uh, I...

218
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,666
It was a good match, Makunouchi-kun.
You worked hard for it.

219
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,708
Uh, yeah.

220
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,875
-Hey, kid!
-Uh... Yes?

221
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,875
I'll commend you on your mental strength
not to give up to the bitter end.

222
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:44,041
But if you ask me,
your technique still needs a lot of work!

223
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,458
We need to start you over from scratch!

224
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:50,625
Starting tomorrow, we'll resume
the killer training, so be forewarned!

225
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,791
Aw, he finally gave out!

226
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,250
He's completely out of it!

227
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:01,416
It's surprising he lasted this long,
considering the beating he took.

228
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,625
Yeah.

229
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,416
Huh? Where's the Chief?

230
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,541
He was delivering a speech a minute ago.

231
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:11,458
Ippo's lucky that he doesn't
have to hear the old man nag anymore!

232
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,458
If Kamogawa heard you, he'd kill you!

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,916

<i>How do you like it?</i>

235
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,708
<i>It's the decisive moment, no?</i>

236
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:08,291
It's one of the photos of that uppercut
that I caught with my motor drive.

237
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,541
A pinpoint blow. The punch
that grazes the tip of the chin.

238
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,833
<i>When this punch connects,
the brain is rocked side to side,</i>

239
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,250
<i>causing functional impairment to the legs.</i>

240
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,583
<i>That's why Miyata couldn't get up
even though he was conscious.</i>

241
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:28,916
So, his superhuman reflexes ironically
contributed to the result of that match.

242
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
However, for an ordinary boxer,
it would have been a direct hit,

243
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,458
possibly resulting in disaster.

244
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,083
<i>-That's the thing.</i>
-What?

245
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,583
The amazing destructive power of 1 cm.

246
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,083
I look forward to his progress,

247
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,208
not just as a magazine reporter,
but as a fan of boxing!

248
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,708
Fujii-san, the Editor-in-Chief
wants to see you!

249
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,666
Make sure he matures
into a good boxer, Chief! Later!

250
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,083
You really skipped the press conference
for the World Title Match?

251
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,625
The Editor-in-Chief is furious!

252
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,041
That's okay.

253
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,708
Makunouchi... Ippo.

254
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:06,708
I still can't believe he produced such
a powerful uppercut from that position.

255
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:11,291
Humph! I never taught him
to punch like that!

256
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,625
He has a lot of nerve.

257
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,166
What if he injured a fist or something?!

258
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,791
-What?!
-Uh, nothing.

259
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:30,083
<i>It's been a long time
since I saw the Chief so excited.</i>

260
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,500
Yes?

261
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,125
Hey, what's up?

262
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,000

I can't sleep!

266
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,791
If I don't get to sleep soon,
I'll be late for school in the morning!

267
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,958
Oh, no! What'll I do?!

268
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,875
<i>A professional boxer. Harsh dieting.</i>

269
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,875
<i>Fierce training.</i>

270
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,875
<i>Only a select few can persevere.</i>

271
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,833
<i>At least, that's what I used to think,</i>

272
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,750
<i>but it's different.</i>

273
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:48,916
<i>They don't persevere because they can,
it's because they have to!</i>

274
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
<i>They deserve</i>

275
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:54,250
<i>the light and the applause
because they won against themselves!</i>
