ORIGINAL WORK BY GEORGE MORIKAWA

2
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,608
HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,396
-Oh!
-Here he comes!

4
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,439
Give him heck, Ippo!

5
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,525
Go punch him up!

6
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:23,476
OBSESSION FOR VICTORY

7
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,775
<i>Damn!</i>

8
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,653
<i>How can I be so nervous
after all I've done to get here?!</i>

9
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,156
<i>I must focus on the match!</i>

10
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,747
The first match of
the featherweight class,

11
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,126
scheduled for four rounds,
is ready to begin.

12
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,880
In the red corner, from Nishikawa Gym,

13
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,675
weighing 124 and a half pounds...

14
00:02:55,758 --> 00:03:00,597
Yusuke Oda!

15
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,186
In the blue corner,

16
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,275
from Kamogawa Gym, weighing 124 pounds...

17
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:17,614
Ippo Makunouchi!

18
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,158
-At least acknowledge them!
-Uh, right!

19
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,244
For your information,
this will be Makunouchi's debut match.

20
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,038
Pleased to meet you!

21
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,165
Pleased to meet you!

22
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,125
Pleased to meet you!

23
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,168
Pleased to meet you!

24
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,670
Love the polite hellos, Newbie!

25
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,839
Good luck!

26
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,800
Fighters to center.

27
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,263
Be extra careful about foul play.

28
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,808
I will give serious deductions
for butting and low blows.

29
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,230
<i>Don't try to stare me down,
because it won't work!</i>

30
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,523
<i>I won't stay spooked forever, you know!</i>

31
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,901
Hey, Ippo's staring back!

32
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,820
The kid is showing some backbone.

33
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,907
All right! Let's put
some "umph" into our support.

34
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,369
Good, Ippo! Stare at him
until you kill him!

35
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,121
You need to intimidate him more than that!

36
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,915
That's right! You have nothing to fear!

37
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,293
Because your dong is a heavyweight!

38
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,005
Trust me! The bigger man wins!

39
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,217
Talk about immoral support!

40
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,511
Give the guy a break!

41
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,972
How could he do this to me
on the eve of my debut match?

42
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,141
Don't let it get to you.
Win, and it'll become a good memory.

43
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,269
If you get the chance, use a fast break!

44
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,312
-But never lower your guard.
-Yes, sir!

45
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,523
Round One!

46
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,817
<i>All right, I won't lose!</i>

47
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,820
Heh, that relaxed him a little.

48
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,825
<i>I can't lose. If I lose now,
I'll lose everything.</i>

49
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,830
<i>I'm going to win no matter what!</i>

50
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,582
<i>Excellent. He's in
the proper frame of mind!</i>

51
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,934
<i>Good, I was able to dodge it!
I seem to be in good shape!</i>

52
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,314
<i>What a hard right!</i>

53
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,654
Isn't Oda pacing himself
a little too fast?

54
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,740
I'm worried he'll run out of gas again.

55
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,576
Don't worry. See?
That's a good combination!

56
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,413
<i>What's wrong, Newbie?!
You won't win unless you punch!</i>

57
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,374
Oda is in awfully good shape this time.

58
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,418
Yeah, his punches are in the groove.

59
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,962
He stole the wind
from Ippo's sails. However...

60
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,924
<i>It looks like he can see the punches.</i>

61
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,261
<i>I'm getting used to his swings.</i>

62
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,937
<i>What kind of a punch was that?!
It broke right through my guard!</i>

63
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,189
<i>All right!</i>

64
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,190
<i>Damn!</i>

65
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,235
Aw, man! Why are you
taking a counterpunch?!

66
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,820
His guard is down!

67
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,828
Stop!

68
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,374
Good job sticking with it!
The power of his fists are real.

69
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,796
He'll try to throw more in Round Two.
Listen, never withdraw!

70
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,130
You are both fighters!

71
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,174
The man who runs will lose.
It's that close!

72
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,926
Heh, that's fine by me.

73
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,347
Your opponent is nothing to sneeze at.
Listen, your vigor will prevail!

74
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,184
If he tries to put on the pressure,
retaliate with double the vigor. Got it?

75
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,771
Yes, sir!

76
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,648
Round Two!

77
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,942
Exchanging punches is what I do best.

78
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,444
I'll teach that newbie about
the world of professionals!

79
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,655
That's the spirit!

80
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,699
<i>I'm sure he's feeling the pain,
but he's in good spirits.</i>

81
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,410
<i>That proves he's full of confidence.</i>

82
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,207
<i>I'll punch and punch and keep on punching!</i>

83
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,709
<i>Vigor! I have to fight back with vigor!</i>

84
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,547
<i>Damn!</i>

85
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,632
<i>Two body blows in a row?</i>

86
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,509
<i>He's mastered the art of in-fighting.</i>

87
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,555
Oda's taking those body blows really well.

88
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,765
Yeah, considering how many he's taking.

89
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,518
Those are the type that
made you guys blow chunks.

90
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,603
You knew about that?

91
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,106
Of course! Anyway, don't miss it!

92
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,274
Huh?

93
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,609
Oda is backing into a corner!

94
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,363
They had equal punches, but the difference
in power is starting to show.

95
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,199
<i>I cornered him!</i>

96
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,451
Do it!

97
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,120
You idiot!

98
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,663
That's the same as before!

99
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,206
Come on!

100
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,959
<i>He keeps punching, but he's still strong!</i>

101
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,961
<i>They lied when they said
he had no stamina!</i>

102
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,922
Oda! What are you doing?! Go around!

103
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,841
Get away from the corner!

104
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,470
<i>Hey... The body blows
are starting to affect his legs!</i>

105
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,637
Come on!

106
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,808
<i>Don't get discouraged!
Oda-san must be hurting too!</i>

107
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,811
<i>I'm going to go at him
with everything I've got left!</i>

108
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,696
Why, you...

109
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,869
<i>Do you think you can take me down
with a punch like that?!</i>

110
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,793
I'm not finished yet!

111
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,802
Down!

112
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,514
<i>I... I did it!</i>

113
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,765
That's the way!

114
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,064
<i>I... I can't let it end this way!</i>

115
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,275
<i>What did I do all that running for?!</i>

116
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,362
<i>Why did I go through all that training?!</i>

117
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,657
He got up!

118
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,535
<i>It's no good! He won't win.</i>

119
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,955
<i>And this was the first time
he came so physically prepared</i>

120
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,250
<i>and showed so much grit in the ring!</i>

121
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,128
<i>Damn! Why did he have to be pitted
against such an incredible newbie?!</i>

122
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,631
<i>Oh, God...</i>

123
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,634
<i>This might be my last time in the ring.</i>

124
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,012
<i>I'm not going down
while they're calling me gutless!</i>

125
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,015
<i>It's my chance... My chance for a KO.</i>

126
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,642
<i>I won't let it pass me by!</i>

127
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,227
Box!

128
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,148
It only grazed him.

129
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,484
That was freaky.

130
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,610
Huh? What?!

131
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,077
Doctor!

132
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,210
Was it that right hook?

133
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,587
This is bad.

134
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,089
If the doctor stops the match now,
he'll lose by TKO.

135
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,466
I don't get it.
According to my fortune telling,

136
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,219
Ippo was supposed to
have the best of luck. Remember?

137
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,096
Right?

138
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,432
<i>Scary! Aoki's prophecy was right again.</i>

139
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,391
Huh?

140
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,184
The doctor looks perplexed.

141
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,271
Yeah, because the match
was totally in the kid's favor.

142
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,647
Please resume the match!

143
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,986
Well, fortunately,
it hasn't reached the fascia.

144
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,656
For now, we'll resume the match,
but if the cut opens up again,

145
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,074
we'll stop right away.

146
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,284
-All right?
-Yes, sir!

147
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:22,163
All right! Ready an ice bag!
And the clotting powder!

148
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,497
Box!

149
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,667
Stop! The second round is over!

150
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:31,881
Chief, can you stop this bleeding?!
I worked too hard for today!

151
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,384
If I lose like this,
I'll never be able to accept it!

152
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,428
Don't worry! I'll make it stop.

153
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,180
Stay still.

154
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,517
I am about to put
a secret medicine on your cut.

155
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,938
Good. First, the Avitene powder,
and then adrenalin ointment.

156
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,066
And to finish the job...

157
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,402
So, how is it?

158
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:56,947
It stopped!

159
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,991
The geezer knows his stuff.

160
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:03,454
I'm not sure what he did at the end,
but he's a top-notch cutman.

161
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,706
Thank you, sir!

162
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,584
It's a cutman's job to stop bleeding.

163
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,422
However, it's your job as a boxer
not to make the injury any worse.

164
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,840
Go knock down Oda.

165
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,218
-Before the cut opens up again!
-Right!

166
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,720
Good job getting up from that knockdown!

167
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,889
It's a shame your opponent was injured,

168
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,975
but this is a lucky chance
presented by your grit!

169
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,479
<i>That's right. It's my chance.
My last chance!</i>

170
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,231
Round Three!

171
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,486
<i>My legs are about to give.
It's already the third round...</i>

172
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,031
<i>The old me would have
been totally exhausted by now,</i>

173
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,699
<i>but I'm not myself today.</i>

174
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,493
<i>I'll settle this in the next round!</i>

175
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,704
<i>I don't want the doctor to stop me
and lose by technical knock-out.</i>

176
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,748
<i>I must knock him down
before he can hit me!</i>

177
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,001
Which will come first?
The blood or the KO?

178
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,004
Either way, it will be decided
in this round.

179
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,184
Hey! Oda's still reeling
from the damage he took earlier!

180
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,061
Go all the way! Huh?

181
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,187
Stop that!

182
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,400
He's aiming for your left eye!

183
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,944
Don't fight from a distance!
Get close to him!

184
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,407
He's clinching!

185
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,493
That bastard! What a cheap trick!

186
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,203
Come on, Ref! Separate them already!

187
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,582
Break it up! Get back!

188
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,377
<i>Oh, no! But I put up such a strong guard!</i>

189
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,966
Don't step back!
He'll take advantage of it!

190
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,304
<i>I can't let this go on!
They'll stop the match!</i>

191
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,264
<i>But I can't relax my left guard either!</i>

192
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,726
This is bad.
Ippo's left is completely blocked.

193
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,270
He needs to gauge the distance,
or his right won't connect.

194
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,024
<i>If he could only jab,
it would open the way.</i>

195
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,568
<i>This isn't good! I have to do something...</i>

196
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,028
<i>I have to do something!</i>

197
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,325
<i>I can't hold on much longer!
They'll stop the match!</i>

198
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,660
<i>I don't want that to happen!</i>

199
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,168
<i>What? Southpaw style?!</i>

200
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:29,016
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

201
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,603
<i>I can't hold on much longer!
They'll stop the match!</i>

202
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,688
<i>I don't want that to happen!</i>

203
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,196
<i>What? Southpaw style?!</i>

204
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,703
<i>I'll never give up! I know it's chancy,
but I'll try it like this!</i>

205
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,664
<i>This guy is serious.</i>

206
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,582
He switched!

207
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,917
That's reckless!

208
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,711
Nah. I love this kind of gamble!

209
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,299
<i>When Oda-san comes at me,
I'll block him with right jabs</i>

210
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,510
<i>and stake it on my left straight!</i>

211
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,886
<i>Here he comes!</i>

212
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,137
<i>Huh?!</i>

213
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,810
<i>He's surprised at his own punches.</i>

214
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,812
<i>It feels really weird!</i>

215
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,565
<i>Do you think you can stop me
with those pathetic jabs?!</i>

216
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,985
<i>Without your main cannon,
you're nothing to fear!</i>

217
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,239
<i>Looks like it backfired big time.</i>

218
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,241
Call a stop! Hurry and stop the match!

219
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,743
Not yet! Kid, don't strain yourself!

220
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,997
<i>How can you expect me
not to strain myself?!</i>

221
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,130
<i>How come I can't do it properly?!</i>

222
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,758
<i>The jab is the punch I began with!</i>

223
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,677
<i>Began with?</i>

224
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,433
Those were pretty good jabs!

225
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,434
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

226
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,439
Oh, no!

227
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,443
-He's stopping it!
-Is this it?!

228
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,487
<i>Now I remember. Jabs are...</i>

229
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,739
<i>You're through!</i>

230
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,258
There! Use a left straight!

231
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,261
Stop!

232
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,764
This can't be!

233
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,724
All right, we won!

234
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,506
What?!

235
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,510
The winner, Makunouchi!

236
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,558
<i>I... I won!</i>

237
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,020
Hey!

238
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,524
You fought good.

239
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,949
You did it, Ippo-kun!

240
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,202
Hey, don't just stand there.
Go thank the man.

241
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,453
Uh, right!

242
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,124
Excuse me... Um...

243
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,087
Congratulations on your debut match.
Good luck with the next one too.

244
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,880
Uh, sure!

245
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,011
Thank you for the fight!

246
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,766
So, how does it feel to win by KO?

247
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,936
Actually, it doesn't feel real yet.

248
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,024
I was so caught up in it,
it feels like I won in all the confusion.

249
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,942
Good job, Makunouchi!

250
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,777
Aim for the Rookie King!

251
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,404
I'll be back to root for you!

252
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,246
Thank you so much!

253
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,669
Aoki's fortune-telling
missed for the first time.

254
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,881
So, he ended up taking him down
with just his right jab.

255
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,675
Yeah, I wonder
how many connected in a row?

256
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,804
<i>Yeah, those are scary punches.</i>

257
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,640
<i>However, he only won by a hair's breadth.</i>

258
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,976
<i>He still has a long way to go.</i>

259
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,063
<i>He'd better improve more
or it won't be much fun.</i>

260
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:50,569
{\an8}KO TIME: 3R 2 MINUTES, 35 SECONDS

261
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:57,159
{\an8}IPPO MAKUNOUCHI VICTORIOUS
IN DEBUT MATCH AT KORAKUEN HALL!!

262
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,800
He had the nerve to thank me, the bastard.

263
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,551
Yeah.

264
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,806
Damn it! He took the words out
of my mouth!

265
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:25,229
What have I been doing all this time?!

266
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,692
I was so conceited,
I underestimated boxing.

267
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,739
He taught me that
if you give it all your guts,

268
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,117
boxing can be this exciting.

269
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,513
You saw what happened.
I made a mockery of myself.

270
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,306
Yes, you lost...

271
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,144
but you weren't a mockery!

272
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:11,358
In fact, you never looked more awesome.

273
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,652
I want you to keep boxing.

274
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:21,535
I want to keep boxing, too, but I lost.

275
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,329
They won't set me up for another match.

276
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,873
Oda!

277
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,877
Don't drag your feet around here!
Hurry home and go to bed!

278
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,879
If you don't, it'll affect your training.

279
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,963
Huh?

280
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,966
Listen, his guard was weak.

281
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,926
He only won by a hair's breadth.

282
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,345
We'll win next time.

283
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,640
And at that time,
you will be the challenger.

284
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,940
Thank you, sir.

285
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,701
KOURAKUEN HALL

286
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,121
Chief, thank you for
all you did for me today.

287
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,628
He was in kind of a bad mood, wasn't he?

288
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,714
He's actually ecstatic.

289
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,967
He just doesn't like
to be seen looking happy.

290
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,386
-And to prove it...
-Oh!

291
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,639
-Look!
-We were waiting for that!

292
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,890
Which means...

293
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,559
{\an8}-This is the place!
-All right!

294
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,354
{\an8}This is the reason I go to see the fights!

295
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,149
{\an8}Is it okay for boxers to consume alcohol?

296
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,776
{\an8}Don't be such a stickler!

297
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,487
This is about the only time
we <i>do</i> get to drink.

298
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,446
But...

299
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,991
It's only a toast with one beer,
so it's not "drinking" per se.

300
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,495
We merely want to
enjoy a taste of celebration.

301
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,831
Oh! Hello, Yagi-san! Come on in!

302
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,792
You, too, Takamura-kun! Long time no see!

303
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,212
-Hi, Akemi-san!
-Knock it off, you!

304
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,632
The young people at your gym
are always full of energy, Yagi-san.

305
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,801
Actually, the reason we're here today...

306
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,803
What? You're kidding!

307
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,222
Amazing! This little boy
is really a boxer?

308
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,473
And you won?

309
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,558
You must be incredible under
that innocent face.

310
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,729
Without further ado,
let's toast Ippo's debut match victory.

311
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,814
Cheers!

312
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,857
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

313
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,734
-You must have worked hard.
-Uh, yeah.

314
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:21,154
Still, I sure am impressed
Oda fought that hard.

315
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,740
We call those "Revival Miracle Jabs."

316
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,367
I'm amazed you thought of that!

317
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,119
Actually, I wasn't really thinking.

318
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,578
Hmph!

319
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,539
<i>I've never experienced anything like this!</i>

320
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,709
<i>I have friends around me,
and it's so much fun...</i>

321
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,838
<i>I never knew that
winning could be this wonderful!</i>

322
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,924
Hey, this boy is blushing for some reason.

323
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,301
That's adorable!

324
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,344
Uh, I am?

325
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,806
I have a soft spot for guys like him.

326
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,392
Maybe I'll become
a fan of yours, Ippo-kun.

327
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,810
Huh?

328
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,940
Adorable, you say?!
Don't let him trick you!

329
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,027
Once you see how huge it is,
you'll never call him adorable again!

330
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,820
Just a darned minute!

331
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,114
I can't believe
you're doing this to me again!

332
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:07,242
You embarrassed me so bad
before the match, I almost died!

333
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,661
Huh? What is it? What's huge?

334
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,122
Uh, no... It wouldn't interest you!

335
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,540
<i>This</i> is what I'm talking about!

336
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,256
Oh, my...

337
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,788
<i>Butting.</i>

338
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,542
<i>Close-quarter fighting so tight,
you breathe secondhand air.</i>

339
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,087
<i>Heads could easily clash by accident.</i>

340
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,755
<i>But that's just technical difficulty.</i>

341
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:47,425
<i>However, if you find out
it was done on purpose,</i>

342
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,010
<i>it not only hurts, it's aggravating!</i>

343
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,929
<i>But for some reason,</i>

344
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,348
<i>a head-butt from a friend makes you happy!</i>

345
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,977
<i>Next time, "Becoming a Bully's Buddy."</i>
