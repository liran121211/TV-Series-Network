HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,833
<i>Round three, two minutes, 22 seconds, KO.</i>

4
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,541
<i>Winner, Mashiba.</i>

5
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,916
That's the outcome of today's match.

6
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,625
It's hard to believe Miyata-kun lost.

7
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,833
Boxing really is unpredictable.

8
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:08,750
Takamura-san.

9
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,541
Did Mashiba do it on purpose?

10
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,125
Accidents like head butting
or tripping over opponents' feet

11
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,625
aren't uncommon during a match.

12
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,791
But in Mashiba's case,
it was obviously intentional.

13
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,750
That cheating bastard!

14
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,541
We should be more worried about Ippo!

15
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,833
<i>He lost Miyata, who was his only goal.</i>

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,375
As I've told you many times already,

19
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:12,166
Mashiba won't be in today.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

20
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,250
He needs to recuperate
from yesterday's match.

21
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,541
Then, can we ask you a question, Chief?

22
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,208
About the "accident" in the second round...

23
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,708
<i>That's what you were after
in the first place.</i>

24
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:26,208
Yes, about that... How can I put it?

25
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,625
I feel bad for Miyata, but that sort
of thing happens a lot in boxing.

26
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,791
-Oh, Mashiba-kun!
-Hello, there.

27
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,833
Can we ask some questions?

28
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,250
Hey, what are you doing here?

29
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,000
I told you to rest today, didn't I?!

30
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,333
Mashiba-kun, that sure was
an amazing match yesterday.

31
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,250
Any comments?

32
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,125
Would you like to say
something regarding the final bout?

33
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,041
Uh, wait!

34
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,541
We've heard that Miyata-kun
will be hospitalized for a while.

35
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,958
I'm sure that bothers you.

36
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,041
I hope he has a speedy recovery.

37
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,333
About the accident
which caused the reversal...

38
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,166
He really had you in a corner, didn't he?

39
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:02,083
Naturally, it was unintentional, right?

40
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:06,791
Unintentional? Get out of here.

41
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:11,333
Not one punch from that suck-up got to me.

42
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,833
Give that Miyata a message from me.

43
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:18,041
Tell him he's lucky
that a hospital stay is all he got.

44
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,041
What an idiot!

45
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,375
He's confusing boxing with brawling.

46
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,958
So, he did it on purpose.

47
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,500
Man, he pisses me off.

48
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,041
Is he actually happy winning like that?

49
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,625
Looks like you still have a lot of damage.

50
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,583
Are you still here?

51
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,041
If you want to write
that I did it on purpose, go ahead.

52
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,000
Say I stepped on that wimp's foot
to teach him how tough

53
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,583
boxing really is.

54
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:56,875
You're the one who knows best
how wimpy Miyata-kun really was.

55
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,666
Besides, I'm not interested in
the accident.

56
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,375
It was a splendid match.

57
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,875
And you won.

58
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,083
However, there's one guy
who isn't exactly at peace with that.

59
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,375
Makunouchi.

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,875
He came all this way
with Miyata as his goal.

61
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,625
He worked his butt off to reach the final.

62
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,166
And he saw yesterday's match.

63
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,125
I'm sure he'll give
the final everything he's got.

64
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,625
What do you think
your odds are of winning?

65
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,875
Mashiba-kun?

66
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:43,125
That was his goal? He makes me laugh.

67
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,958
Does he think he's in a ring with a buddy?

68
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,666
Give me a break!

69
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,333
There's no way I'll be beaten
by a loser like him.

70
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,875
I will win!

71
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,375
I will be the winner.

KAMOGAWA BOXING GYM

73
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,708
Yo!

74
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,416
Hey, those are great sounds!

75
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,333
Hey, Ippo!

76
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,333
Hello!

77
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,416
-What do you think?
-Huh?

78
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,083
I think he's okay, probably.

79
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,416
Yo!

80
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,625
Hey!

81
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,375
So what do you think of Ippo?

82
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,291
He seems to be in great condition.

83
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,458
That little...

84
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:37,958
Idiot!

85
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,333
I'm sorry!

86
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:45,083
You've been hitting the sandbag nonstop
while I was out doing roadwork!

87
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,916
Stop it, you idiot!

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,750
I told you to stop!

89
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,166
You stupid fool.

90
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:09,458
Unbelievable. You were
punching way too recklessly.

91
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,750
His bones seem to be all right.

92
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,375
But he won't be able
to punch a mitt for a while.

93
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,708
And we only have a month till the match.

94
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,375
I... I'm sorry.

95
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,250
I understand how you feel.

96
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,375
However, if you take
emotional baggage into the ring,

97
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,541
like the desire to avenge Miyata,

98
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,208
you'll only be killed.

99
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:35,000
However, it would be unreasonable
to ask you to cool your head right away.

100
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,833
Still, you need to at least
be calm enough to analyze

101
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,250
how you can defeat
Mashiba and avenge Miyata.

102
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,166
Oh, yeah. Chief, let's show him that.

103
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,500
Huh? Oh, yeah.
It should help you conquer Mashiba.

104
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,000
Conquer?

105
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,333
Just watch.

106
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,500
Match two of the Eastern Japan
Rookie Championship Tournament.

107
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,416
Same tournament, match three.

108
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,833
He uses flicker jabs to pin down
the opponent within his reach,

109
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,208
then aims careful punches
from the upper right.

110
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,208
This is Mashiba's KO pattern.

111
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,083
The "chopping right."
You need to watch out for that.

112
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,416
The hitman style is
practically tailored to Mashiba's needs.

113
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,666
However, that very hitman style
is also his weak point.

114
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,041
Although it gives
the user invincible power

115
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,416
when used for offense,

116
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,583
it has an unexpected pitfall.

117
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,541
Here, for example.

118
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,250
Here...

119
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,791
Here, and even here.

120
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,125
Do you see it?

121
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,208
His left guard!

122
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,125
Yup, you got it.

123
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,916
Hitman style puts emphasis on
the offensive,

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,166
which inevitably leads to the lowering of
the left guard to throw fast jabs.

125
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,666
<i>Because of that, defense is sacrificed.</i>

126
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,916
<i>That is why not many boxers use
this technique full of offensive power.</i>

127
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,708
Mashiba's primary weapon is flicker jabs,

128
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,791
the right straight,
and long hooks from either side.

129
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,916
It is safe to assume that all
of his punches are long-range.

130
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,083
So, if I step in deep
and attack him from the right...

131
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:33,000
You got it! Hitman style is vulnerable
to attack from the right!

132
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,958
If that's the case,
you need to aim at his chin.

133
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,250
His knees buckled
after a single counterpunch,

134
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,708
so he's got to be weak there.

135
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:43,208
Dive in, deliver a right straight,
or even a hook, and BOOM!

136
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,125
This could work, Ippo!

137
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,125
I don't think it'll be that easy.

138
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,000
Come on, you can do it!

139
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,458
Your hard work will pay off.
Have faith in yourself!

140
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,625
Well, yes. I do think I can see
the light at the end of the tunnel.

141
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,000
However...

142
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,500
How do you plan to
get that close to Mashiba?

143
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,541
Plan?

144
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,583
Why, he'll simply jump in. You know.

145
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,208
Ippo did a great job
getting close to Hayami, you know!

146
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, then why couldn't
his other opponents get close to him?

147
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,208
Now that you mention it...

148
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,125
Ippo, stretch out your arm.

149
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,041
Huh?

150
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,333
Like this?

151
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah. Now...

152
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,208
Oops! Sorry, I didn't mean to.

153
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,333
The hell you didn't! What's your point?!

154
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,541
Just hear me out.

155
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,458
Mashiba has a reach of 187 cm, right?

156
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:34,000
That's about the same as mine.
Which means...

157
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,583
His is bigger than yours by this much.

158
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,625
Approximately 20 cm.

159
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,208
If you dive at him like usual,
your punches won't reach him.

160
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,208
<i>And if you end up wasting time,
mucking with his flicker jabs...</i>

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,958
This can't be.

162
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,333
But I just discovered what to aim for.

163
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:01,125
It'd be impossible to master
Miyata's technique in a month.

164
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:05,083
If only Ippo could spar with someone
who knows how to do flicker jabs.

165
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:13,000
But there's no one at our gym who can.

166
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,125
Huh?

167
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,750
You need to do more
than just imitate the guy.

168
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,041
I know that!

169
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,250
Who asked you to reach him?

170
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,458
Your quick step-in isn't bad,

171
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,208
but, like Kimura said,
if you just dive in,

172
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,958
you might hit a breakthrough.

173
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,125
So you're telling him to go in head-on?

174
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,083
But the guy has sent
several boxers to the hospital!

175
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,041
In the match, it will be crucial
to secure a good distance.

176
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,541
Mashiba has the advantage
fighting outside,

177
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,958
while the kid has the inside.

178
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,416
It will be a battle of wills

179
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,666
over who can get close
and who can stay away.

180
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,375
-Yes, sir.
-It's all about force of will.

181
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,291
The one who gets cold feet will lose.

182
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,708
That's what it will boil down
to in the final.

183
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
If you can't chill out
because of Miyata, fine.

184
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,458
Take all that anger out on Mashiba!

185
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,958
I will!

186
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,916
Infighting is all I've ever had.

187
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,333
In a sense, it may be
just as well you hurt your fists.

188
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,708
You're going to need more dash
and dart power than ever before!

189
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,500
Run and run and run some more!

190
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,916
Yes, sir! I'll go right now!

191
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,458
So, your countermeasure
for flicker jabs is to play it by ear?

192
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,041
But if he can't do it,

193
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,208
the kid will never even lay
a finger on Mashiba.

194
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,458
<i>His reach is 20 cm longer.</i>

195
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,416
<i>I need enough dart and dash power
to instantaneously bridge the gap!</i>

196
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,750
<i>All right!</i>

197
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,791
{\an8}HAJIME NO IPPO: THE FIGHTING!

198
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,000
<i>It's not like I didn't expect it,</i>

199
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,458
<i>but running every day
sure makes my legs sore.</i>

200
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,750
<i>But I still need to do more running.</i>

201
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,041
YAMANAKA BAKERY

202
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,208
<i>Maybe I'll get some buns on the way home.</i>

203
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,583
<i>I wonder what's wrong?
She doesn't look happy.</i>

204
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,916
<i>Well, she did go to Miyata-kun's match.</i>

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,750
<i>Maybe it was a big shock for her.</i>

206
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,666
Thank you. Let's see...

207
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,000
-Excuse me, but...
-Yes?

208
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,916
You were at Korakuen Hall the other day,
weren't you?

209
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,291
You were rooting for Miyata-kun, right?

210
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,583
I... I was, too.

211
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,500
It was a real shock, wasn't it?

212
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,333
But in reality, he would have won...

213
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,083
if only his opponent hadn't cheated.

214
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:32,500
So I'm saying, it's not
like his real ability is at fault,

215
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,500
so please cheer up!

216
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,958
Stop it, please!

217
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:47,041
Please stop badmouthing my brother.

218
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,583
You don't know him that well,

219
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,291
so how can you talk about him like that?

220
00:14:56,375 --> 00:15:00,416
Why does everyone
make him out to be the bad guy?

221
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,375
‪OTA INN

222
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,666
Give me a break.

223
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,375
Every time you have a problem,
you come to me.

224
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,625
So, what is it this time?

225
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,000
It must be really serious.

226
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,250
I'll hear you out without poking fun.

227
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,833
Um, don't tell anyone.

228
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,666
Of course I won't!

229
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,625
Just pour your heart out.

230
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,083
You'll feel better after you tell someone.

231
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,833
Takamura-san. Actually...

232
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:39,083
I saw Mashiba-san's little sister today.

233
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,083
His little sister?

234
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:47,083
And then, I accidentally
badmouthed him to her face.

235
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,208
Thanks for your help!

236
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,500
Do you feel a little better?

237
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,333
Yes. I'll start running hard
again tomorrow!

238
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,916
Yeah, that's the spirit!
Don't let stuff distract you.

239
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,500
Right!

240
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,625
Uh, please make sure
not to tell anyone about this.

241
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,000
Right! Of course I won't!

242
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,375
One, two, three, four,

243
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,291
five, six, seven, eight.

244
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,666
Okay, time to do some running!

245
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,833
Still, that's surprising!

246
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:32,125
Yeah, Mashiba's little sister
doesn't look a thing like him.

247
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,791
What a shocker.

248
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,166
Are they really siblings?

249
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,208
But you got to admit, Ippo has good taste.

250
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,583
Just a minute!

251
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,750
Oh, you're here?

252
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,125
How do you know about that?!

253
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,625
YAMANAKA BAKERY

254
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,166
Those bags...

255
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,125
Yo!

256
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,416
Good afternoon!

257
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,916
YAMANAKA BAKERY

258
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,833
So, what do you think of her?

259
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,958
Well, she's way beyond cute,
for one thing!

260
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:01,291
He kept it from us at Miyata's match.

261
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:04,041
You told them, didn't you?

262
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,791
I confided in you
and you think it's funny!

263
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,125
How could you?!

264
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,583
I don't think it's funny.

265
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,500
Aoki and Kimura are worried about you
too, you know!

266
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:19,208
Or are you suggesting
that they're not part of the team?!

267
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,083
That's not the point.

268
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,416
Seriously speaking though,
you're going to have it rough.

269
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,958
You just got devastated
by the thing with Miyata,

270
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:30,333
and now you've fallen
for the little sister of his killer.

271
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,416
It's depressing.

272
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,875
You're like the main character
in a tragedy.

273
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,500
Yes, it is a tragedy, isn't it?

274
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,375
Huh?

275
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,125
He thinks he's Romeo or something!
Ippo's becoming a man!

276
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,250
He's totally in the mood!

277
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,708
<i>I must have been out of my mind.</i>

278
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,125
<i>I consulted the most dangerous person
in the world.</i>

279
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,625
<i>These people will turn
any tragedy into a comedy.</i>

280
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,583
Hi, there. It sure is lively in here.

281
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,500
Hey, Fujii-chan! We've got
a real scoop for you!

282
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,458
You see, Mashiba has a little sister...

283
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,666
And he's fallen for...

284
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,958
Give me a break!

285
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,750
Mashiba's little sister? Oh...

286
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,750
It seems like you already know about her.

287
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:33,083
Actually, I just met with the person
who was his probation officer.

288
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,250
Probation officer?

289
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,791
Well, nobody's perfect, you know.

290
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,750
In particular, young people
tend to lose control of their energy.

291
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,250
Oh.

292
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:45,250
Mashiba's abnormal level of obsession
for victory aroused my curiosity.

293
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,250
Does it have anything to do
with him stepping on Miyata's foot?

294
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,833
Yeah. Three years ago,

295
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,708
they lost their parents
to a traffic accident.

296
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,500
A traffic accident?

297
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:00,416
They've been surviving
on their own ever since.

298
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,666
<i>On their own?</i>

299
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,625
Oh, Ryo, you're home!

300
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,666
You must be hungry.
I'll make something for you right now.

301
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,458
-No, thanks.
-What?

302
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,375
You're about to go to
your part-time job, right?

303
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,958
I'm going to the gym.

304
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,333
No way.

305
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,875
If you're going to train,
you definitely need to eat first.

306
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,250
I'll make spaghetti!

307
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,833
It's full of carbs and easy to digest.

308
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,458
It turns into energy quick.

309
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,458
I appreciate it.

310
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,458
The boss congratulated you
on making it to the final.

311
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,791
He says that if you become

312
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,375
Rookie of the Year,
he'll throw you a party!

313
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,958
Ryo?

314
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:52,875
So what?

315
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,708
Oh, come on! Don't talk like that.

316
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,000
Your boss takes good care of you.

317
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,666
People never say what they mean.

318
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,291
We don't know what
they're actually thinking.

319
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,958
We've been lied to so many times already.

320
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,958
Ryo...

321
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:15,916
No matter where I work,
I'm always the first to be laid off.

322
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,666
The reason is simple.

323
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,583
They all rehearse to say the same thing.

324
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:25,166
"He misbehaves.
He'll try something sooner or later."

325
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:32,041
Still, you can't speak badly of your boss.

326
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,583
He's never said anything like that, right?

327
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,750
They're understaffed right now.

328
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,291
They'd hire anything that moves.

329
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,333
Otherwise, they'd never hire me.

330
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,166
Don't worry.

331
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,666
Even if I do get laid off,
I have nothing to worry about.

332
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,083
I have boxing.

333
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,208
If I become Rookie of the Year,

334
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,583
I'll be ranked 10th in Japan.

335
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,583
The Japanese Title
will be within my grasp.

336
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,666
If I become World Champion,
I'll make a fortune.

337
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:10,458
After that, people can take
their opinions and shove them!

338
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,583
I can't wait.

339
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,625
You have nothing to worry about.

340
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:26,791
You don't have to worry about money,
making ends meet, school...

341
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,583
You don't have anything to worry about.

342
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:36,375
<i>I don't care about going to college
or making ends meet.</i>

343
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:43,916
<i>I can't bear to see
you suffer so much for me.</i>

344
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,375
<i>You work a day job, train,</i>

345
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,625
<i>and get even more hurt in the fights.</i>

346
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:57,583
<i>Ryo, someday... you'll wear out.</i>

347
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,291
<i>But the match is another matter.</i>

348
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,625
<i>I can't forget how Miyata-kun looked!</i>

349
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,833
<i>I absolutely can't lose this match!</i>

350
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,375
<i>Hitman style.</i>

351
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,500
<i>You put your weight on your</i>

352
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,625
<i>back leg, and sink your stomach in.</i>

353
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,541
<i>You go on offense,</i>

354
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:41,208
<i>in which the left guard is lowered
in order to make fast jabs.</i>

355
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,500
<i>But if I can step in deep enough,</i>

356
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,875
<i>his lowered left guard
will become his weak spot,</i>

357
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,083
<i>and his chin will be wide open.</i>

358
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,333
<i>That's why I must dive in!</i>

359
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,083
<i>I must reach his chin somehow</i>

360
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,583
<i>with the power of
my newly trained dart-and-dash!</i>

361
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,500
<i>Next time, "The Battle for Distance."</i>
