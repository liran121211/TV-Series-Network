1
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,907
I'll be as fast as I can.

2
00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:02,709
Jesus Christ.
I'll never get used to seeing that.

3
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:04,881
Won't have to
much longer.

4
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:07,323
Got you scheduled
for surgery tomorrow.

5
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,350
Finally close you up.

6
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:11,487
- More surgery?
- It's a good sign.

7
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:13,963
Dr. Plepler doesn't think
he'll need access anymore.

8
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:21,469
Watch it with
the morphine, now.

9
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:32,913
Beautiful thought.
Who put that up?

10
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:34,851
My sister.
Who else?

11
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:37,480
Why you keep it up there
if you don't find it inspirational?

12
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:40,814
My daughter likes it.

13
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:44,322
Everybody keeps telling me
how lucky I am.

14
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:47,854
You are. Septic shock?
As long as you were out?

15
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:49,696
Attending staff
gave you 20 to one.

16
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:52,202
You read the paper?

17
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:53,864
My own uncle
puts me through this.

18
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:59,835
New gunshot.
Rapper. Da Lux.

19
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:03,211
He's hot. Got shot seven times
coming out of a club.

20
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,975
He's still got
all his pancreas, though.

21
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:10,550
All done.

22
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:14,756
Fiona.

23
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:17,159
Look,
I've been feeling...

24
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:21,994
I don't know,

25
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,228
not myself,

26
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:26,066
since I woke up
from the coma.

27
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:32,341
My thoughts keep
running away with me.

28
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,538
These feelings?
They'll pass.

29
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:37,571
It's very common
in post-surgical patients.

30
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:40,140
Maybe you'd like to talk to someone.
Social worker?

31
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,157
Hey babe, how ya feeling?

32
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,394
Oh, good good.

33
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:57,867
That candy striper
out there,

34
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:59,767
there's not much
of a selection.

35
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:03,262
There was something on "Sink the
Bismarck," but half the pages were gone.

36
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:05,071
But you like dinosaurs.

37
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,403
Having surgery tomorrow.

38
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:11,074
They say they're
closing me up.

39
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:34,001
Gus!

40
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:37,007
Jason,
my condolences.

41
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,669
Your dad was the best boss
any of us ever had.

42
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:42,145
We're sad to hear
you're selling the company.

43
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,670
I've been going
over the books.

44
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:45,876
We're paying
an Anthony Soprano

45
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:48,408
the second-highest salary
in the company.

46
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:50,080
He's a consultant.

47
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:52,089
Where do I reach him?

48
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:55,092
I want to make some changes,
but his office is full of junk.

49
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:57,492
There's a 55-horse
Johnson outboard on the desk.

50
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,497
Looks like nobody's
ever there.

51
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,897
He's in the hospital.

52
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:05,801
You should talk
to his colleague, Mr. Gaultieri.

53
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:08,305
Paulie?

54
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:11,399
Oh, Tony Soprano.
Of course.

55
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:14,172
I knew him when I was a kid.
He was a friend of the family.

56
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:17,905
I'm having surgery tomorrow.
I'm not supposed to eat!

57
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,512
You fucking
believe this?

58
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:24,419
Always something.

59
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:27,424
So anyway, she was crying
the entire night

60
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,619
and I didn't get
any sleep.

61
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:32,653
Why don't you ride on the fucking
zephyrs and sleep on a cloud?

62
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:35,530
What, you think
I put that up there?

63
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,660
- I didn't.
- Right.

64
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:39,932
Who then?

65
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:45,804
Hello.
I can't hear...

66
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:49,280
Yeah talk louder!

67
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,248
Nanny.

68
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:53,807
Between the reception
and her language skills...

69
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:07,589
I suppose you got a little
choo-choo train at home, huh?

70
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:10,328
Takes your toast right from the kitchen,
delivers it to your bedroom?

71
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:12,632
Look, Ton', I'm sorry
about what happened

72
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,833
with Junior
and the shooting, but...

73
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:18,274
Don't mention Junior
to me ever again.

74
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:21,642
I'll tell you this, Bobby

75
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,943
you can't hide behind
this brother-in-law shit forever.

76
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:26,780
You're an okay guy,
but each and every man

77
00:06:26,818 --> 00:06:28,843
is judged
on his own merit.

78
00:06:40,832 --> 00:06:43,164
- Have you heard the good news?
- Jesus Christ!

79
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:45,169
That's right.

80
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:47,228
Aaron Arkaway,
Jan's friend.

81
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:52,103
Oh yeah, right.

82
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:54,543
We're protesting
downstairs and

83
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,444
I saw Jan in the elevator
this morning.

84
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:57,914
She told me
you were up here.

85
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:00,850
That's what all
that yelling and singing is?

86
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:03,513
The druggist from the hospital
pharmacy was fired

87
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:06,250
for refusing
to fill birth control prescriptions.

88
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,259
We're trying
to get his job back.

89
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:10,921
Tony, this is our prayer leader,
Bob Brewster.

90
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:13,897
Hi, Aaron's told me
a lot about you.

91
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:15,797
I thought we'd come up
and pray with you.

92
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,734
- Bottom feeding, huh?
- It's where the big fish are.

93
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:25,073
Son of a fuckin' bitch!

94
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:30,046
Cut my morphine,

95
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:33,710
trying to wean me off.

96
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:38,154
You know, I've seen people delivered
from unbelievable pain...

97
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:40,885
myself included.

98
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:42,984
- Oh yeah?
- I was at rock bottom.

99
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:45,427
I was addicted
to cocaine and strippers.

100
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:49,160
Then I lost my wife
and I crashed my car, drunk.

101
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,796
Ended up upside down, hanging
by my seat belt, completely terrified.

102
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,931
Then I prayed
for God to save me.

103
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:57,441
- And He came in.
- Praise Him.

104
00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:59,272
And in that moment,
I was reborn.

105
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,778
And I see you there
and I know you're hurting.

106
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:04,805
And the answer is to accept the Lord
as your personal Savior.

107
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:09,978
Well I got all this covered, you know,
with my parish priest.

108
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,955
That's great,
but what God wants

109
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,117
is for you
to love Him directly,

110
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:16,786
not necessarily through
the intercession of liturgy

111
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:19,456
or any human agent.

112
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:22,125
Is this
Aaron Arkaway?

113
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,964
- Hey.
- What are you fellas doing here?

114
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:26,595
Mrs. Soprano.

115
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:28,366
We were just dialoguing
with your husband.

116
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:30,704
We were about to pray.

117
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:33,506
- They were.
- You're having surgery tomorrow.

118
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:36,206
You know they've done clinical
studies about the power of prayer.

119
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:39,808
Prayed-for patients
have 11% fewer complications.

120
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:43,116
I have read that.
It does help to pray.

121
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:45,850
I mean even if it just
takes your mind off it.

122
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,051
Dear Jesus...

123
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:51,357
hear these words
and bestow Your loving, healing grace

124
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:54,763
upon our injured friend.
Lord, help heal his wounds

125
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,233
and help him with
Your cleansing love.

126
00:08:57,268 --> 00:08:59,566
Where sin abounds,

127
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:01,902
grace abounds even more.

128
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,335
Amen.

129
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,936
- Amen.
- Amen.

130
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,674
Amen.

131
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:19,954
So, Reverend,
let me, uh...

132
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:22,755
let me ask you about
this guy not selling birth control.

133
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:25,388
He should be free
to exercise his moral convictions

134
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,524
without suffering
loss of livelihood.

135
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:32,733
Well here's
what I'm getting at... I'm... I'm...

136
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,432
I'm worried
about Viagra.

137
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:37,407
The way I see it,
I'm gonna need plenty of that,

138
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:40,275
considering
my condition and...

139
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:43,872
what if somebody decides that Viagra
is wrong and God don't like it?

140
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:47,976
Well, God loves
procreation.

141
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:49,953
No one's saying
anything against Viagra.

142
00:09:49,987 --> 00:09:53,150
Birth control in the name
of the morning-after pill is a sin

143
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:55,955
because it strikes
at life, at the unborn.

144
00:09:55,993 --> 00:09:58,120
Yeah but what if somebody
goes after Viagra?

145
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:00,027
I'm not talking
about procreation

146
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:01,998
and listen up,
'cause this affects you too.

147
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:04,160
Something like Viagra
will never be an issue.

148
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:06,830
Excuse me, but at one time
they were going after booze,

149
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:10,363
and as a proprietor
of a drinking and eating establishment,

150
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:12,239
I take this stuff
very seriously.

151
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:14,210
Strip club,
I believe it is.

152
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:16,270
- Oh, you've been to the Bing?
- No.

153
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:18,509
He should rest.

154
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:20,915
Thank you so much
for coming, Pastor, and Aaron.

155
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,749
Thank you so much
for your prayer.

156
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:26,188
- Sure.
- Yeah, really I...

157
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:30,160
- I really appreciate it.
- Bye, guys. Praise God.

158
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:43,640
- What are you, a wiseass?
- What?

159
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:45,232
What'd I do?

160
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:57,816
- Oh my God.
- What is it, Doctor?

161
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:01,256
I just found Jimmy Hoffa.

162
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:05,251
In Montana, the fossilized remains
of a Tyrannosaurus rex

163
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:08,231
yielded soft tissue that indicated
a definite link

164
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,757
between dinosaurs
and modern birds.

165
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:15,761
- Look who I got here.
- The sanitation prince.

166
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:18,366
Hi, Tony. I'm sorry
you're not feeling well.

167
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:20,900
Thank you.
Sorry about your loss.

168
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:23,106
Your father and I
were very close.

169
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,312
Remember my daughter
Meadow? Jason Barone.

170
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:30,946
- Hi.
- Hey.

171
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:33,183
Remember
when you were a kid,

172
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:37,160
at that field box
at Shea, opening day?

173
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:39,857
Me, you, your dad
and Paulie here?

174
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:42,593
Oh yeah. Kingman was
just back from the Cubs.

175
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:45,761
Mookie Wilson hit that foul tip,
beaned that guy in the loge.

176
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:48,169
I gotta get to the office.
Finn's picking me up.

177
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:52,371
- I'll be back later.
- Sweetheart,

178
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,378
thank you
for everything.

179
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:57,711
Okay.
Don't wear him out.

180
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:00,180
She wants to be a doctor.

181
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:03,187
Also considering law.

182
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:10,460
So, you're living
in Deer Valley?

183
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:11,791
Yeah, ski instructor.

184
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:15,287
So, Paulie tells me
you're thinking of selling

185
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,961
your father's business
to Chuckie Cinelli.

186
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:20,800
Yeah, I think it's
the best thing for Mom.

187
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:23,636
And of course, Tony, there'd be
a severance package for you.

188
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:26,242
Frankly, Jason,
I don't think

189
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:28,245
you should sell
the business right now.

190
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,874
There's a lot
of potential buyers out there.

191
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,407
When I get out of the hospital,
run the numbers,

192
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:36,215
get you
the best price.

193
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:37,983
No, Cinelli's offer
seemed fair.

194
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:39,887
There's lots of things
to take into account.

195
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:42,392
- You even know what your EBITDA is?
- My what?

196
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:47,159
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
Depreciation and Amortization.

197
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:50,224
Gives the true picture
of a company's profitability.

198
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:55,471
Jas', you let me
handle this.

199
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:58,532
I don't want
to see you get hurt.

200
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:00,840
The carting business,

201
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:03,813
it's a different
corporate culture.

202
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:06,510
You're tired, T.
We'll leave. Come on.

203
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:11,512
All right.
Bye, Tony.

204
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,628
We're afraid
she doesn't have long left.

205
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,501
I'm surprised she
didn't call Ma.

206
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:30,234
Well she asked specifically
to see you.

207
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,953
Ooh, Madonn'.

208
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:46,013
Paulie.

209
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:49,117
Aunt Dottie.
Hold on a sec.

210
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,460
- It's chilly in here.
- I'm burning up. I'm burning up.

211
00:13:53,497 --> 00:13:56,330
I brought you
some pignolis and...

212
00:13:56,367 --> 00:14:00,895
a new pair of those
Speedo skin-diver socks you like.

213
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:03,338
Look at those.
The treads are all gone.

214
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:06,537
You slip on the linoleum again,
then where are we?

215
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:09,341
- Paulie, I gotta tell you...
- Just a sec.

216
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,077
Sister, please
give me a hand here.

217
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:15,711
Put these
on my aunt, will ya?

218
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:18,017
Paulie,
you should know...

219
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:21,718
- Speak up, Aunt Dot.
- I was...

220
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,956
- I was a bad girl.
- How could you be a bad girl?

221
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:28,158
- You're a nun.
- These are too small.

222
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:31,191
No they ain't. They're supposed
to be snug so she don't slip.

223
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:32,497
- Put 'em on.
- Paulie...

224
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:35,334
During the war,
I was still a novitiate.

225
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:37,773
I was helping out
at the USO,

226
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:41,938
and there was
this soldier, Russ.

227
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:45,471
And he was
so lonely...

228
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:47,507
Aunt Dottie,
if this is going where I think,

229
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,280
maybe you should
talk to a priest.

230
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,311
I got pregnant.

231
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:54,688
- I had a baby.
- A baby?

232
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:58,661
Listen to her.
The Alzheimer's is gettin' to her.

233
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:01,995
You didn't have
no baby.

234
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:04,626
I did.
I did have a baby.

235
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:08,126
Paulie...
it was you.

236
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:12,434
You're my son.

237
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:16,037
But...

238
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,048
But Ma...?

239
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:22,041
Marianuccia
is your aunt.

240
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:24,281
I'm your Ma.

241
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:29,952
I was a bad girl.

242
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:36,900
Good afternoon, Mr. Soprano.
How are you doing?

243
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:40,263
- Better now.
- I'm glad to hear that.

244
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,633
Where they been
keepin' you?

245
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:46,199
The other doctors
around here

246
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:48,108
it's like the United Colors
of Benetton.

247
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:50,238
I'm not a doctor.

248
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:52,112
I'm a utilization
review specialist.

249
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:53,912
I represent
your insurance carrier.

250
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:56,181
It's my job, together with
your physicians,

251
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,656
to see how fast we can
get you out of this place and back home.

252
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,251
Well this is good.
They've closed your incision

253
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:06,889
and you're ambulatory
now and I see they got the Foley out.

254
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,457
You wanna kick
me out of here.

255
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:13,163
Well, a hospital stay
costs a lot of money.

256
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:16,071
My bowels don't work.
I'm in pain.

257
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:18,131
I just got operated on,
for Christ's sake.

258
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,439
Perhaps your bowels
would be working better

259
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:23,504
if you hadn't tried to eat
the sausage sandwich on 3/28.

260
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:26,072
I don't believe this. With all the money
I've been contributing

261
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:29,643
over the years,
you wanna put me in the street.

262
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:32,952
Look, you think we're the enemy,
but if you hadn't had insurance,

263
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,423
you would have ended up
at the County Hospital.

264
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,323
It's a good thing that you had your
card with you

265
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,622
when they performed
the wallet biopsy.

266
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:39,788
- The what?
- In the ambulance.

267
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,354
If you hadn't had
your card with you,

268
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:42,990
they would have dropped your butt
at Martin Luther King.

269
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:45,228
The "wallet biopsy"?

270
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:47,260
Get out of my room,
you sick cunt.

271
00:16:56,714 --> 00:17:00,206
You're doing great.

272
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:03,743
Mrs. Soprano? Doctor Taschlin's
on the phone for you.

273
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:06,381
Can you sit here
for a minute, Ton'?

274
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:08,755
Yeah, I'm winded.

275
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:12,556
He says he's
downhearted.

276
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:14,564
I tried to explain
to him

277
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,225
there's an upside
to everything.

278
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:17,894
Yeah, man.

279
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:20,062
I know it's
a difficult struggle,

280
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:22,265
but let's lead with some good news
for a change.

281
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:24,274
Yeah.
"Armor Gettin'" CD

282
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,640
is now charting
number five, arrow up.

283
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:29,703
Look, frankly the shooting
couldn't have come at a better time.

284
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,305
Yeah,
but it really hurts.

285
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:35,182
Sure it does, baby boy.
Sure it does, but check it.

286
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:38,450
Seven caps!
Tupac ain't get near that.

287
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:40,150
And 50,
he only got two more.

288
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,953
Yeah, but it really hurts.

289
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:44,324
It's helping considerably
with the street cred,

290
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:47,296
which, as you know, has always
been something of a problem

291
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:50,664
because you had
a job all those years.

292
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,259
I'm gonna
lose my thumb?

293
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:54,897
Special hand surgeon
coming in.

294
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:58,466
Come on, man.
You gonna be all right, Lux.

295
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:01,501
"Don't put on that face.
It don't make me weep.

296
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:04,708
Keep your eyes to yourself,
you sexy freak."

297
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:06,579
Nah, I like it better.

298
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:09,643
"Keep your eyes to yourself, bitch.
I'm on a murder streak."

299
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:10,949
Word, word.

300
00:18:10,988 --> 00:18:12,250
Yeah, kinda warn her ass,
you know what I mean?

301
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:15,053
- Yeah, that's fine.
- You writing a song, huh?

302
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:18,027
I always wondered
how it was done.

303
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:20,292
Like this here.

304
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:22,094
Are you a rap star
my son would know?

305
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:24,293
Da Lux gonna
produce my album.

306
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,360
Then he gets shot.

307
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:28,564
Make him gangsta
number one.

308
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:30,267
It's like he losing
focus on my shit.

309
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:33,071
My son says he's
more popular than ever 'cause of it.

310
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,704
What I know is
I ain't gonna have...

311
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:37,646
no major release
this year.

312
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,615
Man.

313
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:47,123
Dear...

314
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,271
Paulie,
I won $40 at Keno.

316
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,508
Is there something
you wanna tell me about?

317
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:11,480
What?

318
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:14,484
I just saw
Aunt Dottie, and guess what?

319
00:19:14,518 --> 00:19:16,383
Turns out
she's not my aunt.

320
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,047
Turns out
she's my mother.

321
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:20,352
No, that's not true.

322
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:23,326
Don't bullshit me.
You been bullshitting me my entire life.

323
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,557
- Paulie.
- It's true, isn't it?

324
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:28,963
Isn't it?

325
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:32,093
Son of a bitch!

326
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:34,127
Oh how I dreaded
this day.

327
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:35,900
I gave you
everything!

328
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,566
I gave you
a son's love,

329
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:39,633
all under
false pretenses.

330
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:41,645
- No.
- You're a fraud,

331
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,112
and a phony.

332
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:44,637
And she's even worse.

333
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:46,115
She's a whore.

334
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,811
My mother's
a fuckin' whore!

335
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:49,944
Don't say that.
She was a young girl.

336
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:51,249
She wanted
to be a nun,

337
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:52,653
but she got
in trouble.

338
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,625
And you helped her out,
cooked up this little scheme.

339
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:57,126
Forget who gets
victimized!

340
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:01,120
I loved you.
I always loved you.

341
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,793
Paulie!

342
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:18,172
There he is.
I've been thinking about your problem.

343
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:21,241
Maybe it would help you
if you got shot.

344
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:24,186
Fuck you talking 'bout?
"Got shot"?

345
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:27,782
Make you more popular too,
you know raise your profile with Ex Lax.

346
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:30,521
Something easy.
The fleshy part of the thigh.

347
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:33,496
- I'm a marksman.
- You's a crazy motherfucker.

348
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:42,328
And Good morning. Welcome to "Today"
on a Thursday morning.

349
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:43,930
- I'm Matt Lauer.
- And I'm Katie Couric.

350
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,635
Poll numbers vary...

351
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:47,871
...somewhat disappointing
for the administration.

352
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:54,107
Excuse me. Hi.
You're a friend of Anthony's.

353
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:56,381
I was just about to visit him.
How's he doing?

354
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,083
He's in a lot better shape than those
fuckin' nuns you got up there.

355
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:05,261
Put away such memories.

356
00:21:05,295 --> 00:21:08,628
Between father and son,
there is a bridge

357
00:21:08,665 --> 00:21:09,927
which neither time
nor death...

358
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:12,595
T, I got
Phil Leotardo downstairs

359
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:16,936
This show...
used to watch it all the time

360
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:18,532
- when I was a little kid.
- What about it?

361
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:22,341
The bridge of which I speak,
Grasshopper.

362
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,111
- You want me to bring him up?
- No.

363
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:30,848
Help me out of here.

364
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:42,589
Hold on.

365
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:44,692
Easy easy.

366
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:49,367
Ho! Where the fuck
you going?

367
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:51,397
Sorry, Ton'.

368
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:00,540
Hope you got
some sleep last night.

369
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:04,179
I was snoring
like a son of a bitch.

370
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:08,681
Oh, I hope you got some sleep.
I was cutting farts like sonic booms.

371
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:10,693
John Schwinn.

372
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:12,490
Oh, bicycle heir.

373
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:15,157
Unfortunately no relation.

374
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,861
I was just a foot soldier
at Bell Labs.

375
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:20,335
Oh, you guys
invented stereo.

376
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,895
Tony Soprano.

377
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,430
What're you in for?

378
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:26,465
Sinus infection.

379
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,843
They were going to enlarge the opening
in my lower right maxillary sinus,

380
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,780
and then they saw
some stuff they didn't like,

381
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:34,750
so they're running tests.

382
00:22:34,785 --> 00:22:36,480
Another guinea pig.

383
00:22:39,022 --> 00:22:41,047
Thank you
for giving my kid that CD.

384
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:43,719
Tony Soprano?

385
00:22:45,229 --> 00:22:48,528
- Original G.
- Yeah, whatever.

386
00:22:48,565 --> 00:22:51,693
Why don't you come by
my joint later on tonight?

387
00:22:51,735 --> 00:22:54,499
Gonna have the fight
on satellite.

388
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,848
Not even
a courtesy call,

389
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:07,248
are you trying to poach
my company?

390
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:09,912
No disrespect, Tony.
You've been in a coma.

391
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:14,356
That gives you carte blanche?

392
00:23:14,391 --> 00:23:17,690
It's that fucking John.
He's sitting in the can.

393
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:19,628
The feds are trying
to take everything he's got.

394
00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:23,360
- He's in a panic state.
- I'm sensitive to that.

395
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,459
But whatever happens
to Barone Sanitation,

396
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:29,165
I gotta be kept on.
I need that W-2.

397
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:34,007
And as you can see,
I'm facing a long convalescence here.

398
00:23:34,044 --> 00:23:37,275
And Barone is my secondary insurance
carrier. I need it.

399
00:23:37,314 --> 00:23:40,044
John's gonna take care of you.
You know that, Tony.

400
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:43,211
But what you're asking?
25% of the sale price,

401
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:45,551
years' salary
till retirement,

402
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:49,582
plus skim?
Come on.

403
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:52,026
Look, I don't
wanna argue.

404
00:23:52,062 --> 00:23:56,522
I'm not well, so I'll give John
a break on the skim.

405
00:23:56,566 --> 00:23:59,467
Getting two Gs
a week now.

406
00:23:59,503 --> 00:24:02,370
How many stops
we base that on?

407
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:08,171
How many stops?

408
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:10,236
- 11.
- The fuck you talking about?!

409
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,875
- It's at least 25.
- 25.

410
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:17,182
What? Yeah.

411
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:21,123
All right,
take the skim on 20.

412
00:24:21,158 --> 00:24:24,753
1,500 a week, but I stay on
the payroll as is.

413
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:28,196
All I can do is deliver
the message, Anthony.

414
00:24:28,231 --> 00:24:32,793
You got your head
up your ass today.

415
00:24:32,836 --> 00:24:35,566
- What's going on?
- My Aunt Dottie's been sick.

416
00:24:35,605 --> 00:24:37,835
Call I got?

417
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:40,240
She just died.

419
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:48,979
Sorry.

420
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:53,287
You were close?

421
00:24:56,593 --> 00:24:59,323
Your mom's sister
or your dad's?

422
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:03,299
Mom's.

423
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:06,359
She must be
broken up, huh?

424
00:25:06,403 --> 00:25:08,064
Here we are.

425
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:11,165
Guess your brother
and sister coming in?

426
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:13,574
Yeah.

427
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,135
Your aunt,
she's the nun.

428
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:18,841
- Yeah.
- Always wondered.

429
00:25:18,882 --> 00:25:21,009
They got hair
under there?

430
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,781
Yeah, short.

431
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,415
Well maybe you don't
wanna talk about it.

432
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:31,791
Yeah.

433
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:39,564
Those wedding rings
they wear,

434
00:25:39,603 --> 00:25:43,004
are they really
married to Jesus?

435
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,031
So I understand.

436
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:55,207
T, this is the guy,
the paramedic.

437
00:25:57,721 --> 00:26:01,248
"Wallet biopsy"?
Nice.

438
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:03,156
Very nice.

439
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:06,094
These people are saying I took money
from your wallet? Fuck that.

440
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,619
What'd you say?

441
00:26:07,664 --> 00:26:09,655
I was looking
for proof of insurance.

442
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:14,295
- I was only doing my job.
- They heard a lot of that at Nuremberg.

443
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:18,067
You owe me two K.
It was gone from my wallet.

444
00:26:18,108 --> 00:26:19,473
I don't have
that kind of money.

445
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:22,569
One week, Rudy Diaz,

446
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:24,170
or you'll need
a paramedic.

447
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:31,418
Oh, nice of you
to come by.

448
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:32,979
We'll see you
next week, huh?

449
00:26:33,023 --> 00:26:34,991
All this activity, Tony,
are you getting any rest?

450
00:26:35,025 --> 00:26:37,550
Absolutely. The guys
are just leaving.

451
00:26:37,594 --> 00:26:39,619
Carmela.

452
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:48,265
So, you two came together.
You talking now?

453
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:51,274
Mom apologized to me.

454
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:53,367
And he got a job
at Blockbuster.

455
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:57,176
Good. Well I'm glad
to see you made up.

456
00:26:57,214 --> 00:26:59,774
- Yeah, get 'em, man.
- Know what I'm saying?

457
00:26:59,816 --> 00:27:02,046
Fucker keeps
dropping his hands.

458
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:04,144
Your boy's
getting tired.

459
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,458
Fool's costing me
50 Gs.

460
00:27:08,492 --> 00:27:10,653
Who you place
your action with?

461
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:13,686
- Pinnacle.
- Online?

462
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,254
What price they give
you on Alvarez?

463
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:17,562
350.

464
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:19,296
- Damn!
- Oh man.

465
00:27:19,336 --> 00:27:22,203
Hold the motherfucker
steady!

466
00:27:24,107 --> 00:27:26,701
My friend here'll
give you 375.

467
00:27:26,743 --> 00:27:28,938
Right, Paulie?

468
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:32,642
He don't even
wanna fight, man.

469
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:34,946
Wonder what kind
of health insurance he's got.

470
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:36,646
It's a life of abuse.

471
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:39,621
Yes, well he
is a boxer.

472
00:27:39,656 --> 00:27:41,624
It's the same
for everybody.

473
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:44,752
Look at you, T.
You do your uncle a kindness,

474
00:27:44,794 --> 00:27:46,955
you get shot
for your efforts.

475
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:49,898
You think you got family,
but in the end,

476
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:52,800
they fuck you too.

477
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:55,964
He's grieving.
His aunt just died.

478
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:59,373
I tell ya, we each
and every one of us,

479
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:02,435
we're alone in the ring,
fighting for our lives,

480
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:05,607
- just like that poor prick.
- Well, that's one way to look at it.

481
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:08,015
- You got a better one?
- Don't get me started.

482
00:28:08,051 --> 00:28:10,042
- It's complicated.
- You think I'm stupid?!

483
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:15,046
It's actually an illusion
those two boxers are separate entities.

484
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:17,753
- What the fuck?
- Illusion?

485
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:21,491
Their separate entities is simply
the way we choose to perceive them.

486
00:28:21,531 --> 00:28:23,726
- I didn't chose nothing.
- It's physics.

487
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:26,258
Schrödinger's equation.

488
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:30,171
The boxers, you, me, we're all part
of the same quantum field.

489
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:32,607
You ever substitute teach
at Carver Middle School?

490
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:36,305
He's a rocket scientist,
for Christ's sake. Bell Labs.

491
00:28:36,346 --> 00:28:39,804
Shit. Lift it up,
nigga!

492
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:42,215
You were saying?

493
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:45,415
Well, think of the two boxers
as ocean waves

494
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:47,719
or currents of air,
two tornadoes, say.

495
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:51,056
They appear to be two things, right?
Two separate things.

496
00:28:51,094 --> 00:28:53,961
But they're not.
Tornadoes are just wind,

497
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:56,591
the wind stirred up
in different directions.

498
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:59,568
The fact is, nothing is separate,
everything's connected.

499
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:01,537
Everything is everything.

500
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:04,369
- I'm down with that.
- Get the fuck out of here.

501
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:07,638
The universe is just
one big soup of molecules

502
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:09,872
bumping up against
one another.

503
00:29:09,913 --> 00:29:14,009
The shapes we see exist only in our
own consciousness.

504
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,382
Keshawn, don't make me
come over there.

505
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:19,149
You're so fucking smart,
fix that TV.

506
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:24,751
Okay okay.

507
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,766
Besides the financial ramifications,

508
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:35,896
he says there's the issue of his W-2
and health insurance.

509
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:38,635
That selfish prick.

510
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:41,508
I'm sitting in here
facing a shitstorm

511
00:29:41,544 --> 00:29:44,604
and all he can think
about is himself?!

512
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:48,676
As far as
the sale's concerned,

513
00:29:48,718 --> 00:29:51,084
that ship has sailed.
It's going through,

514
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:55,353
and as a friend,
I would appreciate Tony's help.

515
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:59,158
Because he's a friend,
here's what I'm willing to do.

516
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:03,427
Cinelli will retain him as waste
management consultant for two years.

517
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:08,426
During that time, he can keep his
fucking W-2 and his health insurance.

518
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:12,464
Plus 5%
of the sale price.

519
00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:16,672
And we lease him
a new car.

520
00:30:16,713 --> 00:30:18,146
Are you fuckin'
kidding me?

521
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:21,275
I told them I need
that W-2 in perpetuity,

522
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:24,549
and 5% of the fucking
sale price?!

523
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:27,147
He thinks 'cause I'm
in this weakened condition,

524
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,556
he can take advantage.
Well, he can go fuck himself.

525
00:30:29,592 --> 00:30:31,924
I'm just telling you
what Phil told me, Ton'.

526
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:33,690
You tell Jason
before he sells,

527
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,755
he better understand
his obligation!

528
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:34,523
What's up, Paulie?

529
00:31:34,557 --> 00:31:36,923
Since even with Tony's advice,
you seem determined

530
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,690
to sell your father's company,
there's something you should know.

531
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:42,926
Whatever happens,
we gotta be taken care of.

532
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:45,230
Yeah, of course.
I'm going to honor whatever provisions

533
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:46,860
- are in the contract.
- Fuck the contract.

534
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:49,201
Tony's given years
of his life to that company,

535
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,639
and he expects
to be duly compensated.

536
00:31:51,674 --> 00:31:53,972
Johnny Sack sure as shit
ain't gonna perform.

537
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,376
- Who?
- Mr. Cinelli's waste management

538
00:31:56,413 --> 00:32:00,144
consultant. And since Johnny Sack
ain't gonna step up,

539
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:02,879
guess what?
It's coming out of your ass.

540
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:04,944
You know, I'm starting to feel
a little intimidated.

541
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:06,853
As well you should,
my friend.

542
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,256
A man who teaches skiing
for a living

543
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:11,658
ought to look after
his physical condition,

544
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:14,458
wouldn't you say?
His knees.

545
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:16,465
Kid, you wouldn't be in this
situation

546
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:18,763
if you'd listened to Tony
in the first place.

547
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:21,896
He's looking out for you.
He doesn't wanna see you get hurt.

548
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:26,233
I got a lot on my
mind these days.

549
00:32:26,276 --> 00:32:29,245
I don't need
this shit.

550
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,350
Jason, we shook hands.
A deal's a deal.

551
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:42,153
There's lifetime employees
who expect compensation.

552
00:32:42,192 --> 00:32:45,184
It's only equitable. Now if you're
willing to take care of that,

553
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:46,923
maybe we could
still work things out.

554
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:48,897
Tony Soprano, right?

555
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:50,866
Fuck that and fuck him.
He's your problem.

556
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,698
- Look, the numbers just don't work.
- Jason!

557
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:55,897
I'm going
to the buffet table.

558
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:59,033
Be right there, Mom.

559
00:32:59,075 --> 00:33:01,339
If I give Tony what he wants,
I lose money on the sale.

560
00:33:01,377 --> 00:33:04,778
- I can't do that to my mom.
- Kid, you work it out any way you want,

561
00:33:04,814 --> 00:33:07,305
- but nobody's backing out of the deal.
- Mr. Cinelli, I'm sorry,

562
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,443
but the bottom line is I'm not selling
the company to you.

563
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:12,319
There are other buyers out there.
Tony was quite clear about that.

564
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:14,482
I'll tell you the fuckin' bottom line,
laddy buck.

565
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:16,651
The Barone routes
are now Cinelli routes.

566
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:18,251
That's that.

567
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,138
T.

568
00:33:37,914 --> 00:33:40,883
Horrible thing.
They brought this little girl in,

569
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:44,045
she's got third-degree burns
on 80% of her body.

570
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:46,385
You wouldn't believe
the week I've had.

571
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:50,716
What?

572
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,888
There's a little girl
burned in there.

573
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:57,730
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry, T.

574
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:00,861
No. Now what the fuck
is with you?

575
00:34:00,904 --> 00:34:03,737
And I want some answers, 'cause you're
starting to drive me fuckin' nuts.

576
00:34:05,141 --> 00:34:06,870
This remains between us?

577
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,344
'Course.

578
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:13,372
My aunt who died...

579
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:15,407
she wasn't my aunt.

580
00:34:17,987 --> 00:34:19,045
She was my mother.

581
00:34:19,088 --> 00:34:22,182
What?
Your aunt, the nun

582
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:23,692
was your mother?

583
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:26,923
Some cocksucker G.I.
knocked her up during the war.

584
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:28,658
Russ.

585
00:34:28,698 --> 00:34:31,599
- So what was your mother?
- My ma's my aunt.

586
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:35,434
She adopted me
to hide the family shame.

587
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:37,666
Believe this shit?

588
00:34:37,707 --> 00:34:39,299
All I did for her.

589
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:42,778
Not only is my ma
not my ma,

590
00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:45,679
who the fuck even knows
who this Russ bastard is?

591
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:52,545
Worst thing,
I'm not who I am.

592
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:55,490
It's like my whole
life is a joke,

593
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:57,516
a big fuckin'
joke on me.

594
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:47,073
- What's going on?
- This ain't your route no more.

595
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,668
It's ours. Cinelli.

596
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:51,271
What do you mean?
I have this route for five years.

597
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:53,839
Stupid fuck.

598
00:35:53,883 --> 00:35:55,578
Fuck this.

599
00:35:57,587 --> 00:35:59,418
Papi!

600
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,831
Papi!

601
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:14,200
Papi!

602
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:18,438
Papi! Papi!

603
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:20,567
Papi!

604
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,010
Papi!

605
00:36:31,254 --> 00:36:33,984
Get back in your pajamas,

606
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:37,823
go to bed, eat nothing but gallons
of ice cream, tons of pizza...

607
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:41,755
Who's there?

608
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:45,233
Oh, hi Paulie.

609
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:48,601
You didn't go to your mother's funeral.
It's a sin.

610
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:51,436
Some mother. Even a rat don't
abandon its own children.

611
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:53,533
No, you should
feel sorry for her.

612
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:55,942
She's gonna have
to face St. Peter

613
00:36:55,978 --> 00:36:58,276
with this stain
on her.

614
00:36:58,314 --> 00:37:00,782
- I hope she rots in hell!
- Don't say that!

615
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:02,842
And you.
I was your meal ticket,

616
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:05,217
the goose
with the golden eggs!

617
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:08,052
Look at this place.
Who set you up here?

618
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:11,219
Not that fuckin'
brother of mine or Rose.

619
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,854
They never provided
you with shit!

620
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:16,626
Well, your real children
can start now.

621
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:21,867
I went without,
so you could have.

622
00:37:21,904 --> 00:37:25,897
The mink coat, the massage chair
from Sharper's Image,

623
00:37:27,343 --> 00:37:29,470
the flat-screen TV.

624
00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:32,777
$2,000 bucks
for a woman I don't even know!

625
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:35,045
Paulie!

626
00:37:46,062 --> 00:37:48,121
Paulie, please.

627
00:37:48,164 --> 00:37:51,327
You're on your own.
I never wanna see you again.

628
00:38:01,177 --> 00:38:03,304
I told you. It's a different
corporate culture.

629
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:05,109
I tried to redefine
the deal.

630
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:08,276
You shouldn't have made the deal without
talking to me in the first place!

631
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:10,342
Well God damn it,
how was I supposed to know?

632
00:38:10,386 --> 00:38:13,583
I made it perfectly clear:
Give up part of your profits.

633
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:15,818
Thanks to you,
a man is beaten half to death.

634
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:17,450
While his little boy
was watching.

635
00:38:17,493 --> 00:38:18,960
And it's
all over the media!

636
00:38:18,995 --> 00:38:22,658
It's not fair.
The business belongs to my family.

637
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:24,962
"Fair"?

638
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:27,231
You fuckin' believe
this shit?

639
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,101
You remind me of my kid.

640
00:38:29,138 --> 00:38:31,902
Talk to the Katrina victims
about fair.

641
00:38:31,941 --> 00:38:34,466
Talk to Paulie here.
He'll tell you about fair!

642
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,910
- Absolutely.
- You're worse than my son!

643
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:39,210
- Get him the fuck outta here!
- Hey!

644
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,018
How was I supposed to know?
My family kept me in the dark.

645
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:50,423
What kind of pathetic fuckin' excuse
is that?! Don't you communicate?

646
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:53,428
You make me sick,
you fucking baby.

647
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:05,373
Shoot me one time,
one time only, you heard?

648
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:07,774
Fleshy part of the thigh,
like you said.

649
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,937
There's only 7,000 here.
I said eight.

650
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:13,142
Hey hey hey, I get my little brother
to do it for less, believe that.

651
00:39:13,182 --> 00:39:16,174
Trust me, you gotta go outside
the family for something like this.

652
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:18,483
You don't want
people knowing.

653
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:22,048
That way you can blame it
on Dr. Droop or whoever.

654
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:25,219
7,000's all I got.

655
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:27,252
Okay.

656
00:39:29,198 --> 00:39:32,690
I don't wanna know
when it's coming. You decide.

657
00:39:35,438 --> 00:39:38,100
Get this...

658
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,040
It says here that if the history
of the planet

659
00:39:40,076 --> 00:39:43,068
was represented
by the Empire State Building,

660
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:45,580
the time that human beings
have been on earth

661
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:49,574
would only be a postage stamp
at the very top.

662
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:53,077
You realize how insignificant
that makes us?

663
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:55,283
I don't feel that way.

664
00:39:57,126 --> 00:39:58,593
- Hey.
- Hey.

665
00:39:58,628 --> 00:40:00,095
There he is.

666
00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:03,428
- Hi, Chris.
- Hesh, how are you?

667
00:40:03,466 --> 00:40:05,525
Great to see you
looking so robust.

668
00:40:05,568 --> 00:40:08,435
- Hey.
- How you doing?

669
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:10,200
- Beth wanted to come.
- Yeah, sure.

670
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:13,174
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

671
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:14,870
So how's Eli?

672
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:18,210
I hear that with the physical therapy,
they got him using a walker.

673
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:20,477
He's doing better.
Thank you.

674
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:23,649
Hey, Tony.

675
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:25,210
Okay to visit?

676
00:40:25,254 --> 00:40:27,119
Yeah yeah, sure.

677
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:32,020
My nephew Christopher,
Pastor Bob.

678
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:34,325
Hesh Rabkin,
his daughter Beth.

679
00:40:34,363 --> 00:40:37,696
- Hi.
- How you feeling?

680
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:39,724
Physically,
a little better than I was.

681
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:42,329
So maybe you're right.
That prayer business works.

682
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,606
I brought you something.

683
00:40:46,642 --> 00:40:48,769
- "Born Again."
- Charles Colson.

684
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:50,506
The Watergate guy.

685
00:40:50,546 --> 00:40:52,013
Friend of mine
did time with him.

686
00:40:52,048 --> 00:40:55,711
A ruthless, powerful man
who thought he was above the law.

687
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:58,413
He committed crimes
and then went to prison.

688
00:40:58,454 --> 00:41:01,480
And then he found Jesus,
and everything changed.

689
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:04,821
Became a different man.

690
00:41:05,828 --> 00:41:07,819
Yeah, so?

691
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:12,167
Salvation
isn't just about

692
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:14,635
being saved from hell
after you die.

693
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,231
It's also about being saved from
yourself while you're still alive.

694
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:23,043
I hope when you get
out of the hospital

695
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:26,276
that you'll join us at the Church
of the Open Door of the Redeemer.

696
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:31,178
Well it must be nice

697
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,347
to have something
to hold onto.

698
00:41:35,424 --> 00:41:37,392
Maybe.

699
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:46,201
What?

700
00:41:46,235 --> 00:41:50,296
Dinosaurs.
My kids can't get enough.

701
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,967
Yeah yeah, me too.

702
00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:56,501
Every since I saw King Kong
kick their ass in the original.

703
00:41:56,545 --> 00:41:58,672
My son loves
dinosaurs too.

704
00:41:58,714 --> 00:42:00,648
- That's interesting.
- What?

705
00:42:00,683 --> 00:42:02,708
Some people would
have you believe

706
00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:05,016
dinosaurs existed
millions of years ago.

707
00:42:05,054 --> 00:42:07,716
It's just not true.

708
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:10,885
God created the earth
6,000 years ago.

709
00:42:10,926 --> 00:42:12,860
And I tell my kids,
you have to remember,

710
00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:16,592
dinosaurs and human beings
lived on the earth at the same time.

711
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:20,659
What, like
"The Flintstones"?

712
00:42:20,703 --> 00:42:22,671
It's in the Bible.

713
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:25,367
Yeah but what about all that
carbon-dating stuff?

714
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:27,876
A lot of scientists
would disagree with you.

715
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:31,368
Well, I think you'll find
all those people have an agenda, Tony,

716
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:35,612
evolution, which is
Satan's plan to deny God.

717
00:42:35,651 --> 00:42:39,747
Evolution and salvation
are mutually exclusive.

718
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:43,418
Guy next door's a scientist.
Think he'd disagree with you big time.

719
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:45,188
Then that man's
not saved.

720
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:51,264
Read about Mr. Colson.
We'll talk later.

721
00:42:57,206 --> 00:42:59,868
What's he saying? There were dinosaurs
back with Adam and Eve?

722
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:01,342
- I guess.
- No way.

723
00:43:01,377 --> 00:43:03,242
T rex in the garden
of Eden?

724
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:05,042
Adam and Eve
would be running all the time,

725
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:09,040
scared shitless.
But the Bible says it was paradise.

726
00:43:09,085 --> 00:43:10,950
You can disagree
with Evangelicals,

727
00:43:10,986 --> 00:43:12,283
but they're great friends
of the Jews

728
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:15,984
because Israel
is the Holy Land.

729
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:18,084
You wait.

730
00:43:27,503 --> 00:43:30,336
Hey, how ya doing?

731
00:43:30,372 --> 00:43:33,034
- Hi.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

732
00:43:37,513 --> 00:43:39,174
Your color's better.

733
00:43:39,215 --> 00:43:43,618
So Mr. Wizard, you were talking
about tornados.

734
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:48,646
You know what
the Indians say about the wind?

735
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:50,750
- No.
- They say that sometimes

736
00:43:50,793 --> 00:43:53,387
we go around feeling pity
for ourselves,

737
00:43:53,429 --> 00:43:56,660
but behind our back,
a great wind is carrying us.

738
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:59,259
We don't see we're part
of a much bigger reality.

739
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:02,168
- Then we die.
- Why are you so interested in all this?

740
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:11,608
I was in this coma
and, uh...

741
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,478
Iook, I don't
remember nothing,

742
00:44:13,516 --> 00:44:15,916
but before I woke up,

743
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:19,443
I felt like I was being pulled
towards something.

744
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:24,656
And I don't
wanna go back.

745
00:44:24,693 --> 00:44:27,958
And my wife told me
I woke up at one point and said...

746
00:44:30,366 --> 00:44:32,891
"Who am I?

747
00:44:32,935 --> 00:44:36,837
Where am I going?"

748
00:44:36,872 --> 00:44:38,840
Kinda makes you wonder,

749
00:44:38,874 --> 00:44:42,139
about heaven and hell.

750
00:44:42,178 --> 00:44:45,375
That presupposes a duality
of good and evil.

751
00:44:45,414 --> 00:44:47,382
You know it gets us
back to the idea

752
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:51,614
of separate,
opposing entities.

753
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:53,246
You know where I go
with that.

754
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:55,655
But this Bible guy
I know says you're going to hell.

755
00:44:55,691 --> 00:44:57,488
Maybe he's right.

756
00:44:57,526 --> 00:45:00,393
Got my test results back.

757
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:03,830
Laryngeal cancer.

758
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:06,494
Jesus, I'm sorry.

759
00:45:06,535 --> 00:45:08,469
You know I was thinking,
maybe you could do me a favor

760
00:45:08,504 --> 00:45:10,938
and, uh, you know
what's the term,

761
00:45:10,973 --> 00:45:14,033
"whack" me?

762
00:45:14,076 --> 00:45:17,136
Sorry, bad joke.

763
00:45:31,393 --> 00:45:34,294
- Walking alone again.
- What, I'm gonna wait for Vito?

764
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:37,060
Hour and a half
to take a dump, that guy.

765
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:39,863
Could build a jetty
with what comes out.

766
00:45:48,377 --> 00:45:52,404
Little Paulie tells me
you didn't go to your aunt's funeral.

767
00:45:52,448 --> 00:45:55,713
And I'll tell you
something else...

768
00:45:55,751 --> 00:45:57,844
I'm done with Nucci.

769
00:45:57,886 --> 00:46:00,912
Four Gs a month
for that nursing home? Fuck that.

770
00:46:00,956 --> 00:46:02,423
What are you gonna do,
throw her out on the street?

771
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:04,085
Way I see it,

772
00:46:04,126 --> 00:46:05,821
serves her right.

773
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:08,091
What the fuck, Paulie?

774
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,121
That woman loved you.
She fed you.

775
00:46:10,165 --> 00:46:12,429
How many times she bail you out
of the can when you were a kid?

776
00:46:12,468 --> 00:46:14,902
Am I right?

777
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:18,739
I'll tell ya
what really fries me.

778
00:46:18,774 --> 00:46:21,607
It's not Nucci.
It's Dottie.

779
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:24,374
I know to your way of thinking,
you didn't have a great mother...

780
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:26,506
All I'm saying,

781
00:46:26,548 --> 00:46:28,448
Livia, with all her faults,
never abandoned you.

782
00:46:28,484 --> 00:46:31,146
For Christ's sake, Paulie.
You know what your problem is?

783
00:46:31,186 --> 00:46:32,915
You go around
in pity for yourself.

784
00:46:32,955 --> 00:46:35,048
You think
you got it bad.

785
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,058
You're not stuck
in some hospital room

786
00:46:37,092 --> 00:46:38,787
with fucking tubes
coming out of you.

787
00:46:38,827 --> 00:46:40,920
You can eat food
like a normal person.

788
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:44,194
T, I never meant
to trivialize your situation.

789
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:47,634
Well, you gotta get beyond this petty
bullshit, Paulie.

790
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,968
You're part of
something bigger.

791
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:51,666
When you gonna
learn that?

792
00:46:58,547 --> 00:47:00,606
- My ass!
- Marvin?!

793
00:47:00,649 --> 00:47:03,140
They shot me
in my ass!

794
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:05,619
They shot me in my ass!

795
00:47:05,654 --> 00:47:07,781
Marvin!

796
00:47:13,862 --> 00:47:16,660
Pearl's oyster bar,
the lobster roll.

797
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:22,532
Listen, Ton', that package,
from Vito and Paulie?

798
00:47:22,571 --> 00:47:26,029
I have to believe
that there was more there.

799
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:28,873
Sure. So?

800
00:47:28,911 --> 00:47:32,870
Vito especially
is somebody you should watch.

801
00:47:36,385 --> 00:47:39,286
Mr. Soprano?
Good morning, Mrs. Soprano.

802
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:41,050
Ah, the bird of prey.

803
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:44,890
Okay, it looks like your last drainage
tube is coming out today.

804
00:47:44,927 --> 00:47:47,521
Dr. Plepler says that you are stable
and the pain is manageable

805
00:47:47,563 --> 00:47:49,895
so that's good news.
You're husband's coming home.

806
00:47:49,932 --> 00:47:52,594
- Are you sure he's ready?
- What does she give a shit?

807
00:47:52,634 --> 00:47:54,465
She's trying to save a buck.

808
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:58,269
Hold on a minute.
Guy next door, Mr. Schwinn.

809
00:47:58,307 --> 00:48:02,038
Had surgery
this morning, cancer.

810
00:48:02,077 --> 00:48:03,237
You know anything
about it?

811
00:48:03,278 --> 00:48:05,508
I heard they
removed his larynx.

812
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:19,385
...wrote attorney
Jim Sokoloff...

813
00:48:19,428 --> 00:48:21,623
On the city of 6,000...

814
00:48:21,663 --> 00:48:23,631
"Gitanos."

815
00:48:23,665 --> 00:48:26,998
That's a Mexican word
for gypsies.

816
00:48:27,035 --> 00:48:29,401
Tony? How are you?

817
00:48:29,438 --> 00:48:32,134
Hey!
All right.

818
00:48:32,174 --> 00:48:34,199
I made you
some stuffed zucchini.

819
00:48:34,243 --> 00:48:36,541
- He can't eat that.
- Oh oh, I'm sorry.

820
00:48:36,578 --> 00:48:39,103
It was thoughtful
anyways.

821
00:48:39,148 --> 00:48:41,048
Listen, my condolences
regarding Dick.

822
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:42,482
- You get my flowers?
- Oh yeah.

823
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:43,712
They were beautiful.

824
00:48:43,752 --> 00:48:45,811
- Have a seat.
- Oh thank you.

825
00:48:48,457 --> 00:48:52,188
Jas told me
about the conversation you had.

826
00:48:52,227 --> 00:48:54,787
I can only imagine
how upset you must be.

827
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:57,424
Well it is a very
unfortunate situation.

828
00:48:57,466 --> 00:49:00,492
Jason just doesn't understand
how the business works.

829
00:49:00,536 --> 00:49:03,164
- That's for sure.
- No, it's not his fault.

830
00:49:03,205 --> 00:49:07,039
It's my fault. Dick and I purposely
kept him in the dark.

831
00:49:07,075 --> 00:49:08,440
Blame me, not him.

832
00:49:08,477 --> 00:49:10,001
You're not involved
in this, Helen.

833
00:49:10,045 --> 00:49:11,706
I was too wrapped up

834
00:49:11,747 --> 00:49:15,376
in my own grief.
I didn't realize...

835
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:18,511
He's my boy, Tony.
He's my baby.

836
00:49:18,554 --> 00:49:21,114
It'd kill me
if anything happened to him.

837
00:49:21,156 --> 00:49:22,589
What are you
talkin' about?

838
00:49:22,624 --> 00:49:25,684
Tony, please. You have a son.
I'm begging you.

839
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,864
Helen, believe me,
nothin's gonna happen to him.

840
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:32,662
I'm his mother, Tony.
I love him.

841
00:49:32,701 --> 00:49:35,465
If anyone has to pay
for this, let it be me.

842
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:38,029
How many times I gotta tell you?
It's gonna be fine.

843
00:49:38,073 --> 00:49:39,734
But, Tony,
do I have your word?

844
00:49:39,775 --> 00:49:42,801
Yeah. Yeah yeah,
you got my word.

845
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:11,262
Especially good week
this week.

846
00:50:14,576 --> 00:50:16,510
Good.

847
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:19,604
I know
how good you feel.

848
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:23,914
I was only in the hospital overnight. I
couldn't wait to get out.

849
00:50:23,952 --> 00:50:25,715
Hold on.

850
00:50:27,956 --> 00:50:30,254
You wanna go in,
say goodbye?

851
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,792
No.

852
00:50:52,214 --> 00:50:54,114
I wanted to make sure
you had this before you checked out.

853
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:55,275
Not here.

854
00:50:55,317 --> 00:50:57,751
It's all right.

855
00:50:57,786 --> 00:50:59,219
Let's go.

856
00:50:59,254 --> 00:51:01,620
- Ton'?
- Let's go.

857
00:51:19,207 --> 00:51:22,506
Hey. H-hey!

858
00:51:33,689 --> 00:51:36,089
I'm gonna go get the car.
I'll follow you home.

859
00:51:36,124 --> 00:51:38,115
- Janice.
- What?

860
00:51:39,628 --> 00:51:42,620
Supposed to be dead.

861
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:44,723
Now I'm alive.

862
00:51:47,169 --> 00:51:49,194
I'm the luckiest guy
in the whole world.

863
00:51:50,906 --> 00:51:53,238
Listen, after this...

864
00:51:56,044 --> 00:51:58,103
from now on,
every day is a gift.

865
00:51:58,146 --> 00:52:00,239
Yeah.

866
00:52:01,516 --> 00:52:03,677
I'm gonna go get the car.

867
00:52:14,997 --> 00:52:17,693
Tony? Phil Leotardo
is here to see you.

868
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:19,166
10 minutes.

869
00:52:19,201 --> 00:52:21,135
You're supposed
to be resting.

870
00:52:21,169 --> 00:52:23,364
Hey, blondie.

871
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,140
It's all you, you know.

872
00:52:27,175 --> 00:52:28,665
The reason I'm back here.

873
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,201
No, it's not just me
by any means.

874
00:52:33,015 --> 00:52:35,245
Thank you
for saying that.

875
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:45,316
- Anthony.
- Hey.

876
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:51,363
Johnny doesn't want
another unfortunate incident.

877
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,063
He's willing to let you keep
your paycheck and your W-2 for 10 years.

878
00:52:55,103 --> 00:52:57,298
To replace the skim,

879
00:52:57,339 --> 00:53:00,308
he'll jack up your share
of the sale price to 12%.

880
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,671
No more skim.

881
00:53:13,522 --> 00:53:15,387
Truth be told,

882
00:53:15,424 --> 00:53:19,588
there's enough garbage
for everybody.

883
00:53:19,628 --> 00:53:23,564
- Does that mean we got a deal?
- Yeah, we got a deal.

884
00:53:23,598 --> 00:53:25,088
Be well.

885
00:54:47,215 --> 00:54:49,410
Fuck!

886
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:52,419
Guess what, fuckin'
mama's boy?!

887
00:54:52,454 --> 00:54:54,251
You're kicking up
four grand to me every month.

888
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:56,951
I don't care if you're in Deer Valley
or Death Valley!

889
00:54:56,992 --> 00:54:58,983
Four grand,
every goddamn month!

890
00:54:59,027 --> 00:55:02,121
And if you ever mention
a word of this to Tony,

891
00:55:02,164 --> 00:55:03,961
I'll stick this
up your ass

892
00:55:03,999 --> 00:55:07,298
and pull the trigger
till the bullets come out your eyes.
