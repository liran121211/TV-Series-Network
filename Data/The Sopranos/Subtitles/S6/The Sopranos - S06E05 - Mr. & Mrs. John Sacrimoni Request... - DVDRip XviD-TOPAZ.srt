1
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:48,596
Rusty!

2
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:53,876
Rusty!

3
00:01:53,912 --> 00:01:55,880
You don't answer,
someone calls you?

4
00:01:55,914 --> 00:01:58,144
Look at this
shit now.

5
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,570
What do you got
for me, Counselor?

6
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:20,595
The Brioni.

7
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:38,588
Hear ye, hear ye.

8
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:41,684
The Honorable Dennis Holzer of the
Eastern District of New York presiding.

9
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:44,628
Court is now in session.
Be seated.

10
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:47,359
Come to order.

11
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,857
The defendant's request for temporary
release from federal custody

12
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:54,930
to attend his daughter's
wedding is ludicrous.

13
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:58,568
Mr. Sacrimoni is a known member
of organized crime

14
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,238
at the helm of a vast
criminal conspiracy.

15
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,646
I notice you're wearing
a wedding ring, Ms. Vaughn.

16
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:05,650
Was your father
at your wedding?

17
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:09,142
My father wasn't awaiting trial
on 47 RICO predicates,

18
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,247
including murder.

19
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,658
Mr. Sacrimoni...

20
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:18,185
your application
is granted.

21
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,360
- Oh, thank God!
- On the following conditions. Quiet!

22
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:27,101
You'll be released
for a total of six hours

23
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,869
to attend the church service
and party thereafter.

24
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:33,036
During the entirety
of the six hours,

25
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:36,275
you will be escorted
by U.S. marshals.

26
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:40,308
The cost of their presence,
transportation

27
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:43,810
and the cost of metal detection
screening equipment

28
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:47,086
is to be borne by you
at your own expense.

29
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,616
You will consume
no alcohol

30
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:54,064
nor other
intoxicating substances.

31
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:57,535
Do you understand
and agree to these conditions?

32
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,402
I do, Your Honor,
and thank you.

33
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:03,902
Mrs. Soprano, good morning.

34
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:06,604
- I'm Perry... Annunziata.
- Come in.

35
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:13,749
Beautiful house.

36
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:16,720
You are Gina Annunziata's
cousin, right?

37
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:20,247
Muscles Marinara,
the Italian strongman.

38
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:23,261
I'm just glad you got somebody
capable of protecting you,

39
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:26,662
- driving for you.
- Well, that's why I got him here.

40
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:28,325
She worries,
my wife.

41
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:31,530
- Yeah, well...
- He's in good hands, Mrs. Soprano.

42
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,630
First runner-up,
Mr. Teenage Bloomfield.

43
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:36,868
Your first day
back at work.

44
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:39,001
Gosh, I feel
like a mommy.

45
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:41,069
Hey. Come on.

46
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:43,104
See you later.

47
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:54,019
So what do you do?
Free weights, machines?

48
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:57,586
Little bit of both. Depends what muscles
I'm trying to hit, you know?

50
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:04,457
Yeah, I gotta get
back to the gym.

51
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:06,971
You want, I'll make you
a program.

52
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:13,538
There was a time
when I could bench over 300 lbs.

53
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:16,672
With a major head cold
one time, I did it.

54
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:21,853
You cough with weights
like that over your head,

55
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:23,855
you crush your neck.

56
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,880
I guess I don't
gotta tell you.

57
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,825
Ho! You don't signal?

58
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:38,995
Hey, fuck you!

60
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:56,354
Sorry.

61
00:05:56,388 --> 00:06:00,449
My mom says I should count 10,
but I never remember.

62
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:13,629
Well, here I am.

63
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:17,438
- Back.
- Yep.

64
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:19,444
So let me ask you
right off,

65
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:21,469
is there any chance
of a mercy fuck?

66
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:24,605
Just kidding.

67
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:29,315
- How are you feeling?
- You went to medical school.

68
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,879
A gut shot is everything they ever
told you it was.

69
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:34,448
And emotionally?

70
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:37,223
I'm happy to be alive.

71
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,856
Have you spoken
to your uncle since it happened?

72
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:43,834
No. And won't.

73
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:48,600
Finally get to sleep
in my own bed tonight.

74
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,201
Had a hospital bed
in the house

75
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:55,179
- last month and a half or so.
- Is sleeping difficult?

76
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:58,306
- Tylenol helps.
- What about dreams,

77
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,784
night terrors,
anything like that?

78
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:06,282
Gloom is your business,
and business is good.

79
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:10,226
You were shot, Anthony,
by a member of your family.

80
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:12,628
I know.

81
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:14,632
And unless I know
absolutely nothing

82
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,998
about what I'm doing,

83
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:19,663
I think you and I'll
have a lot to talk about.

84
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,438
Are you familiar
with the term

85
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:27,570
"post-traumatic stress"?

86
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,307
I get it, okay?

87
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:32,407
My uncle tried to kill me,
for the second time.

88
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,250
Three strikes
and I'm out, right?

89
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:38,813
Who knows? Maybe I
am suppressing things.

90
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:40,825
But for right now,
I feel like each day is a gift.

91
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,123
I told my sister.

92
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:44,992
And that's how
it's gonna stay.

93
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,431
Fair enough.

94
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:51,368
Is there something
else you'd like to talk about then?

95
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:55,032
Let's pick up where
we left off before this all happened.

96
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:56,472
AJ.

97
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,533
Believe it or not,

98
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:01,637
things have gotten
worse with that kid.

99
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,707
Flunked out of college.
He waited till I was in a coma.

100
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,311
Didn't you leave Seton Hall after
a semester and a half?

101
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:10,981
All right, fine,

102
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:14,389
but why can't he copy
some of the good things about me?

103
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:17,156
- Does he have a job?
- Blockbuster.

104
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:19,163
First stop
on the shitbird express.

105
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:22,792
In some ways, this horrible shooting
may provide an opportunity

106
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:25,826
for him to learn
from your mistakes.

107
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:27,771
My mistakes...

108
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,933
I got caught up
in domestic violence.

109
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:32,409
You think it can't happen
to you, but it does.

110
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:34,412
But I was referring
to the bigger picture:

111
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,311
The ready access
to guns,

112
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:39,010
the use of violence
to solve disputes

113
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,644
because of the nature
of your work, your uncle's work.

114
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:44,951
I told you I didn't want
to talk about my uncle.

115
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,686
Fine, but for now
is it safe to say

116
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:50,456
that there are worse
ways to earn money

117
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,589
than by stocking shelves
at Blockbuster?

118
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,894
Yeah, there are.

119
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:05,342
- Come on, come on, you in or what?
- Don't fuck with my concentration.

120
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:09,245
I've warned you before.

121
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:12,944
What is it?
800 more?

122
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:15,544
Fuck it. Fold.

123
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:18,613
Cards.

124
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:24,693
Oh! There's the skip.

125
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:27,027
Back with a vengeance.

126
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:29,090
- You look great.
- How are you?

127
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,534
Welcome home, T.

128
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,038
- Come here, you malingerer you.
- Easy easy easy.

129
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:39,771
- Great to have you back, T.
- Fucking great to be back.

130
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:42,905
- Sit, Ton', I'll clear your spot.
- We got you your bialy

131
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:45,473
as soon as we heard
you were coming in today.

132
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:47,280
Nuke that joe
so it's hot.

133
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:59,292
Oh, fuck.

134
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:01,799
The onions...
I can't.

135
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,767
Oh, scoop out
that bialy.

136
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:05,827
- I got it.
- Sorry.

137
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,338
I got it, Ton',
no problem.

138
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:13,808
There you go. I'll get your coffee,
and you're all set.

139
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:18,805
So the municipal
swimming pool,

140
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,114
- the bid start on that yet?
- I got a lunch tomorrow.

141
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:23,120
That guy Deutsch
from the planning commission.

142
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:25,679
Antibiotics.

143
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:28,784
I had that with the spleen.
Staves off the infection.

144
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:32,024
Spleen, my ass.

145
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:35,260
Beat this.

146
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,167
- Oof, Madonn'.
- Fuck that.

147
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:40,194
Check out this bad boy.

148
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:45,540
I had the plastic surgeon,
Taschlin, do the outside sutures.

149
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:51,808
Plepler, the head trauma man,
he did the inside work.

150
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,512
He dealt with the sepsis.

151
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:56,645
I was the first guy
at the hospital to have the VAC.

152
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,986
It's an open-incision
situation.

153
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:02,687
It's a better way to heal.
Less pulling on the outer dermis layers.

154
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:06,026
The thing is with all the Ativan
and the Dilaudid I was taking,

155
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:09,522
intestinal blockage
was a constant fucking problem.

156
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,967
- So in the long run...
- There's your coffee, Ton'.

157
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:14,198
- Yeah.
- Ton', with your medicine,

158
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,467
you want I set my watch
so you don't gotta worry?

159
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,338
Nurse Betty over here.

160
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,741
When my mom had the lupus,
God rest her soul,

161
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:21,746
'round the clock care
I gave that woman.

162
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,078
Medicine, food, lifted her
in and out of the tub.

163
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:26,948
- The man's trying to eat.
- I'm just saying.

164
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:31,285
Another life I might have gone
into health care. I actually enjoyed it.

165
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:33,790
How about a bandage over your mouth
then? We're trying to play.

166
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,692
You can lift a grown
woman out of a tub?

167
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:38,559
Isn't it ironic?

168
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,564
Fucking hospital stay
like mine,

169
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:43,624
you lose goddamn
muscle mass, not fat.

170
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:46,569
Fucking believe it?

171
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:49,767
You'd think at least something good
would have come out of the situation.

172
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:52,402
- You in, Ton'?
- Sure, why not?

173
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:55,572
- He's in.
- Same game, five-card calls?

174
00:11:55,613 --> 00:12:00,107
Same game. Why? You wanna change
games now 'cause I won three pots?

175
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:02,415
Keep the cards
down, Sil.

176
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:04,684
The government's
own neuropsychologist

177
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,850
clearly finds
evidence of dementia.

178
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:09,018
Evidence consistent
with dementia.

179
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,824
Nonetheless, I'm going to
recommend he be sent

180
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:15,560
to a prison psychiatric
facility for further evaluation.

181
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,398
He'll only be warehoused
in a public facility.

182
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,927
Now, Your Honor, we ask
that Mr. Soprano be sent

183
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:24,066
- to a private locked facility.
- Why not a resort in Antigua?

184
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:27,567
You want his mental state
improved so you can put him on trial?

185
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:29,671
Just let him go to a place where
he can get better.

186
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,682
You got Uncle Angelo
at table 19?

187
00:12:38,723 --> 00:12:40,520
What?
He's with Connie and them.

188
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:42,856
And when he sees Aunt Lorraine
and the Haitian boyfriend

189
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:44,953
sitting next to them...

190
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:47,487
- I thought you were on top of this.
- There's 400 people, John.

191
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:49,500
I've had other things
on my mind.

192
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,025
And I'm idling
away the hours?

193
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:55,972
Who's not talking
to who?

194
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:57,975
This one
can't see that one.

195
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:59,442
It's okay, honey.
Take it easy.

196
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:01,104
You were the one
who wanted a big wedding.

197
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:03,979
Catherine, your sister has enough
to deal with without the commentary.

198
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:06,643
I'm sorry I blew
my stack, okay?

199
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,722
We are gonna get through
this as a family, dignified, proud,

200
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:13,917
despite all the persecution
and roadblocks.

201
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,257
And when I say family,
that includes you, too, Eric.

202
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:19,991
- Thank you, John.
- Thank you who?

203
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,123
Thank you, Dad.

204
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:25,794
You...

205
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:30,532
I want you to relax.
Make sure you eat.

206
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:33,408
- You too.
- Me? No, thank you.

207
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:36,436
I am eight lbs. away from my goal,
and I am fitting in that dress

208
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:39,075
- if it kills me.
- Jesus, can we ever talk about anything

209
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:42,109
in this family
besides food?

210
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:48,319
- Three sixes.
- Boat, 10s over Jacks.

211
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:51,226
- Vito, you again.
- All right, that's it for me.

212
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:54,390
- Banker's hours.
- Pace myself, doctor said.

213
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,525
You'd be surprised
how much energy the body expends

214
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:59,162
- during the healing process.
- Penne Arabiatta,

215
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,365
go get the car
cooled down, will you?

216
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:05,035
- Penne Arabiatta.
- Yeah, that's what I call him.

217
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,306
Red pepper flakes
up his ass.

218
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:09,210
He's a fucking hothead.

219
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:14,618
Ton',
Phil Leotardo's here.

220
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:19,612
All right,
bring him in.

221
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,390
There he is.
Back in business.

222
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,864
- How's the labonza?
- Oh, it's good.

223
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:33,530
You guys letting him win?

224
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:36,631
Listen, I need
to bend your ear.

225
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:40,073
Can't it wait?
I was just about to go.

226
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:42,579
I just sat in traffic
all the way from Brooklyn.

227
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:47,142
I was up by John.
He sends his regards.

228
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:50,643
He'd like you to do
him a favor, though.

229
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,986
What now?

230
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:55,584
Our friend there,
the Mayor of Munchkinland,

231
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:57,561
John wants him gone.

232
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,688
Jesus. Rusty?

233
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,461
John's worried he might
find another puppet like Little Carmine,

234
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,468
try to run the family
through him.

235
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:06,663
So why me hit him?

236
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:09,366
You guys got more buttons
than my grandmother's fucking corsets.

237
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:12,240
John wants things to point away
from the family.

238
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,610
You know what?
Tell him no.

239
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,618
Time and again
I've done his bidding.

240
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:23,052
It's time to set
some limits.

241
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:26,352
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

242
00:15:30,094 --> 00:15:32,187
Be well.

243
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:49,978
I thought
I heard the door.

244
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:53,450
How was the first day?

245
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:56,009
It was good.

246
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:58,682
- Tired, though.
- You wanna take a nap?

247
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:05,629
Smells good.

248
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:07,995
Downy fresh.

249
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:19,168
God, this feels great.

250
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,235
It does.

251
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:44,060
Chris.

252
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:46,093
Let 'em in.

253
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:53,166
Ho! Where are the rest
of the 40 thieves?

254
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,202
You got it?

255
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:59,578
Good week.
120 credit card numbers

256
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:01,710
plus the three-digit
security codes,

257
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:04,517
- but I won't charge you no extra.
- Excellent.

258
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:07,023
- Don't leave home without it.
- No, we'll use them.

259
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:10,391
No, credit cards.

260
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:12,419
The commercial.

261
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,466
So Tony's out of hospital.
Please give him our wishes.

262
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:19,527
We brought him
some dates.

263
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:23,332
Also, Chris, you know
how we can purchase

264
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:26,104
a couple of TEC-9 semi-automatics,
extended magazines?

265
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:30,843
Hold on. Who? TEC-9s?
What the fuck for?

266
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,543
It's a family problem.

267
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,710
My former brother-in-law,
actually.

268
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:38,882
All right,
fucking take it easy.

269
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:41,255
What did the guy say?

270
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:44,455
Our friend from the other place,
he talked to the guy?

271
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:46,463
What's his name,
the local guy.

272
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:54,036
Yeah yeah, I know.

273
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,474
Hold on.

274
00:18:03,047 --> 00:18:05,140
Yep, I see it.
Thank you, Ro.

275
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:25,325
Mr. Sacrimoni, I'm Deputy Feathem,
U.S. Marshal Service.

276
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:27,462
This is my partner
Deputy Mayweather.

277
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:29,598
We're here to escort you
to the wedding today.

278
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,801
Gentlemen.

279
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,921
Though ordered by the court,
your release is at our discretion.

280
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:48,949
So based on your behavior or any other
mitigating factors,

281
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:51,154
we can elect
to bring you back early.

282
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:53,163
- Patent leather?
- It's a tuxedo.

283
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:56,462
Have you read an issue
of "GQ" in the past three or four years?

284
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:03,974
Allegra Sacrimoni
getting married.

285
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:06,943
Were we not just
at her christening?

286
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:10,141
1980, 50-lb.
bundle of joy.

287
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:13,548
She'll be a beautiful
bride, Tony.

288
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,575
All brides are beautiful.

289
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:21,319
Wait till this one gets married.

290
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,259
How much are we giving?
So I can write it down.

291
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:25,694
You keep tabs on gifts?
How sentimental.

292
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,029
- That's how it's done, Meadow.
- So we can know if they stiff us

293
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:31,159
- when your big day comes.
- Exactly.

294
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:32,760
All this pressure.

295
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:34,498
I know you'd like to think
it's me pressuring you,

296
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:36,803
but the reality is it's your father
keeps this going.

297
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:39,173
Please, like you aren't desperate
to have a grandchild.

298
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,974
Any thoughts on when you and Finn
are tying the knot?

299
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:44,140
This discussion is over.

300
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,844
Look, sweetie.

301
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:51,044
It's just...

302
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:53,056
what I been through,

303
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,081
it changes the way
you think.

304
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:57,890
Holding my grandkids...

305
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,897
your kids...

306
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:02,092
on my lap...

307
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:06,131
all of a sudden,
it's very important to me.

308
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:21,978
Could I have
your name, sir?

309
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:44,264
Hey, is that the father?
Jesus Christ.

310
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:46,572
Yeah.

311
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,715
Cell phones,
cameras, keys.

312
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:57,550
All metal objects
must be placed in a tray.

313
00:20:57,588 --> 00:21:00,421
- Sir, what is this?
- Nitroglycerin. What do you think?

314
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,188
Cologne. Smell it,
you don't believe me.

315
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:04,319
Proceed.

316
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:13,837
You'd think bin Laden
was getting married in there.

317
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:16,738
You realize they made John pay
for all this heightened security

318
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:18,765
- out of his own pocket?
- Are you kidding?

319
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:20,777
The government did that?

320
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:24,107
- You okay?
- Yeah,

321
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:26,309
- it's hot.
- Almost there.

322
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:35,325
All metal objects
in the tray, sir.

323
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:44,264
Jesus Christ!

324
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:46,395
Arms outstretched,
please.

325
00:21:57,915 --> 00:22:00,440
All right, you'll need to step out
and remove your shoes, sir.

326
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:03,851
- Oh, come on!
- It's all right.

327
00:22:14,432 --> 00:22:16,423
Tony, Tony!

328
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:18,560
- Daddy!
- AJ, get him a chair!

329
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,210
I should have worn loafers.

330
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:36,219
It ain't your fault, T.
It's all this bullshit.

331
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:39,518
- It's a steam bath.
- I'll get a damp paper towel.

332
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:41,354
Sorry.

333
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,429
Here, Ton',
some water.

334
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:49,160
He just got out of the hospital.
Are the shoes really necessary?

335
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,600
- Sorry, Miss.
- Let me do it, don't bend.

336
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:01,033
All right.

337
00:23:01,078 --> 00:23:04,878
I, Eric, take you,
Allegra, to be my wife.

338
00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:08,681
Allegra. Ain't that
a cold medicine?

339
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:11,279
It means happiness
in Italian.

340
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:14,382
What the fuck's that got to do
with cold medicine?

341
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:17,861
...forsaking all others
so long as you both shall live.

342
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:19,863
In sickness
and in health,

343
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:23,560
forsaking all others
as long as we both shall live.

344
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:26,570
Allegra, repeat
these words.

345
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:30,370
I, Allegra, take you,
Eric, to be my husband...

346
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:33,036
I, Allegra, take you,
Eric, to be my husband...

347
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:36,103
To have and to hold
in good times and bad,

348
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:38,115
for richer
and for poorer...

349
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:41,243
To have and to hold
in good times and bad,

350
00:23:41,285 --> 00:23:43,617
for richer
and for poorer...

351
00:23:43,654 --> 00:23:45,485
In sickness
and in health,

352
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:46,956
forsaking all others,

353
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:49,323
so long as we both
shall live.

354
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,351
In sickness
and in health,

355
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:55,832
forsaking all others,
so long as we both shall live.

356
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:20,223
Would you believe this place,
the money they've spent?

357
00:24:20,257 --> 00:24:23,920
It's either this or give it to the feds
in the asset seizure.

358
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:28,125
Check this out. They got a whole
seafood station over there.

359
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:32,226
- You're not hungry, sweetie?
- I don't eat fish. The toxins.

360
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:36,973
Pinot grig
for the missus.

361
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:40,170
- Rum and coke for the kids.
- Thank you.

362
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:43,180
And a club soda
for the convalescent.

363
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:45,614
Thank you, sir.

364
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:48,413
Salut.

365
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:51,216
Hey, there he is.

366
00:24:53,457 --> 00:24:55,391
Meadow,
you look stunning.

367
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:58,452
- Thank you.
- And look at this young dentist,

368
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,693
all handsome
in his Calvin Klein.

369
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:03,825
Some beautiful grandkids
these two will make, huh?

370
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:08,138
So, Ton',
you got a sec?

371
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:09,935
Yeah.

372
00:25:15,112 --> 00:25:17,979
Listen, Ton',
I don't mean to talk business,

373
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:19,983
but I had
to tell you.

374
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:23,350
I met with that guy Deutsch,
the one from the planning commission.

375
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:26,117
Not only is he in charge of approving
bids for all city contracts,

376
00:25:26,156 --> 00:25:28,249
he's also a degenerate
horse player.

377
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:30,055
So he'll play ball?

378
00:25:30,094 --> 00:25:31,686
He's fucking Joe DiMaggio.

379
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:35,358
And this is from Weehawken,
the strip mall.

380
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:42,929
Enjoy your day.

381
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,609
Oh, here he is.
Father of the bride.

382
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:52,707
- Good to see you.
- John, she looks so beautiful.

383
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,378
- It was so moving.
- Thank you, honey. I appreciate it.

384
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:56,943
All this.

385
00:25:56,987 --> 00:26:00,753
Hey, googootz, you wanna
be an event planner,

386
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:02,122
you learn from this.

387
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,287
An event planner?
Where do you get this shit?

388
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:08,560
"Stuff" would do nicely, AJ.
We're at a wedding.

389
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,938
Good to see you,
my friend.

390
00:26:14,972 --> 00:26:17,133
You too, John.

391
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:18,573
It's been a long time.

392
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:20,509
Obviously, I couldn't come
visit you in the hospital.

393
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,876
When I heard what happened,
I was devastated.

394
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:25,575
That's life, huh?

395
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:28,107
So seriously,
what's the damages here?

396
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:30,245
What am I in for
with Meadow?

397
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:33,688
Not counting
the honeymoon, 425.

398
00:26:33,724 --> 00:26:36,318
So adjusting
for inflation,

399
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,123
I'm looking
at half a rock.

400
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:40,687
What's it all for, though, Tony, huh?
What we put in, the grind.

401
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:42,756
Isn't that
for things like this?

402
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,290
Yeah.

403
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:47,794
So I heard Phil
came to see you.

404
00:26:50,507 --> 00:26:54,102
Let's go say hello
to your dad.

405
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:05,578
So how you doing here?
You having a good time?

406
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,921
- Which one are you?
- My friend Tony, Pop.

407
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:11,655
Hey, I'm gonna say
a few things,

408
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:13,754
and these pricks
are watching,

409
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:16,595
so I'm gonna make like
I'm talking to your dad and them.

410
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:20,331
Hey, Aunt... Farris.

411
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:21,929
Hello.

412
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,872
What you asked me to do
with the little guy,

413
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,878
I can't do it.

414
00:27:28,912 --> 00:27:30,880
This fucking prick,

415
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:33,109
he's disruptive.

416
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,880
He doesn't have the balls
to step up himself.

417
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,015
- What did he say?
- So just keep him away from Phil.

418
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:43,584
He's a cancer.
I can't let it spread.

419
00:27:45,729 --> 00:27:49,324
Well, you're gonna
have to use one of your own doctors.

420
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:51,527
Oh, I'd love to.
Believe me.

421
00:27:51,568 --> 00:27:54,230
But my position is
not completely solidified.

422
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:56,466
You should call
Dr. Cuomo.

423
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:59,806
- We're just talking here, Aunt Louise.
- Don't eat that pepper!

424
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:01,868
- When Carmine died...
- What?

425
00:28:01,912 --> 00:28:05,643
Rusty could have been boss.
He should have been.

426
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:08,914
But he didn't want
the responsibility.

427
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:12,080
Like I advised you.

428
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:16,291
Say no more.

429
00:28:16,326 --> 00:28:18,419
It's too fucking
late now anyway.

430
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:20,430
I need your help, Tony.

431
00:28:20,464 --> 00:28:23,365
Some of these guys,
my captains,

432
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,267
they find out I'm behind
the move against him?

433
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:30,399
Make things worse. I can't take
that risk while I'm in jail.

434
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:33,433
Stay out of trouble.

435
00:28:33,477 --> 00:28:35,843
So I'm supposed
to put myself at risk,

436
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:38,177
share the same fucking
jail cell as you?

437
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:40,376
- What did he say?
- I don't know.

438
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:41,884
Forget it, John.

439
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,184
It's Allegra's
wedding, Tony.

440
00:28:45,222 --> 00:28:48,089
The way things are,

441
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:50,355
I don't know if I'll be
around for Catherine's.

442
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:53,454
Look I know you're going through a rough
time right now, all right?

443
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:56,489
Then do me
this favor, Tony.

444
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:08,135
Okay, I'll take care
of it.

445
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:11,610
I won't forget it.

446
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:13,479
All right.

447
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:23,927
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for,

448
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:25,826
for the first time
anywhere,

449
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:29,264
let's give a huge hand
and a lot of love to...

450
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:35,132
Mr. and Mrs.
Eric DiBenedetto!

451
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:41,469
Ladies and gentlemen,
for their first dance as man and wife,

452
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:43,810
Allegra and Eric
have chosen

453
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:45,974
the lovely...

454
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:16,708
Please join our bride and groom
on the dance floor.

455
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:40,194
How you doing
over there?

456
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:42,228
I'm okay.

457
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,210
- Wanna dance?
- Really?

458
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:52,681
It's a slow one.

459
00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:33,746
Thank you, gentlemen.

460
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:46,736
Okay, Corrado.

461
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:04,378
- Taking any medication?
- Coumadin.

462
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:12,490
Not bad, Corrado.

463
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,497
- You got a tree outside.
- Don't bullshit me.

464
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:19,095
Doctor will be in later
to do a thorough admission.

465
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:25,375
So, I'll check in
with you at the end of the week.

466
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:27,673
You're gonna get the help
you need here, Corrado,

467
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:30,009
so you can aid
in your own defense.

468
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:31,810
I didn't shoot anybody!

469
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:34,976
Corrado, look, I don't
know you that well, but you have to...

470
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:37,953
He's my nephew, God damn it.
Why would I shoot him? Why?

471
00:32:39,222 --> 00:32:41,053
The gun was
on the fritz.

472
00:32:42,526 --> 00:32:45,290
I wanna go home.

473
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:47,297
- Corrado, stop it.
- I wanna go home!

474
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:49,492
Stop.

475
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:52,468
You know
that's not possible.

476
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:55,494
If I did it, the fucking gun
malfunctioned.

477
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:59,100
It was old, okay?
I should have cleaned it.

478
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:02,543
Try to get some sleep.

479
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,672
You'll feel better
in the morning.

480
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:12,481
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this time

481
00:33:12,522 --> 00:33:15,423
our lovely bride will dance
with her father.

482
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:16,247
This is how it works,
I'm thinking.

483
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:18,846
We bring somebody over
from Naples.

484
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,720
What?

485
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:23,089
Completely insulate ourselves.
They do Rusty,

486
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:26,152
they're back on a plane
over the Atlantic two hours later.

487
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:30,526
I don't know, T.
You ask me, farming it out

488
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:33,195
is a pussy-ass
maneuver.

489
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:37,164
Excuse me?

490
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:40,699
Ton', the rollatine!

491
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:42,678
Hold on.

492
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:45,374
If we're gonna do it,
we should do it ourselves,

493
00:34:45,415 --> 00:34:47,679
maintain control.

494
00:34:47,717 --> 00:34:50,515
Better yet, tell New York
to fucking handle it already.

495
00:34:50,554 --> 00:34:53,114
John just asked me
specifically.

496
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:54,919
So it's like
the movie then.

497
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:56,858
- What movie?
- One.

498
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:58,554
That you can't
refuse a man's request

499
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:01,587
- on his daughter's wedding day.
- No, it's the other way around.

500
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:04,725
That I should be asking
him for something he can't refuse.

501
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:07,293
- So did you?
- No.

502
00:35:07,337 --> 00:35:11,330
- You should ask not to do this.
- I already fucking agreed.

503
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:14,410
Look, we wanna keep
him placated, right?

504
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:16,412
I mean, the shit with Phil
and his little brother

505
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:18,414
and the perpetual hard-on
he's still got with us.

506
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:20,575
I'm just saying, I don't think
it's a good idea.

507
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:22,710
Well, I didn't ask you
what you fucking think.

508
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:33,187
- Come on.
- You're going already?

509
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,198
He's always like this
at weddings.

510
00:35:35,232 --> 00:35:39,396
You make me sound rude. Crab cakes.
I told you I don't feel good.

511
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:41,563
They don't keep
in this heat.

512
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:43,573
Vito, let's go.

513
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:45,802
Francesca, come on.

514
00:35:47,944 --> 00:35:50,071
Good night.

515
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:24,505
John, gonna have to
wrap this up.

516
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:30,920
Six hours you said.
I got till quarter till 11:00.

517
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:32,979
That includes
transportation, sir.

518
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:36,390
- Jesus Christ, you fucking kidding me?
- I tried, John. They won't budge.

519
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:38,326
Can he have
some cake at least?

520
00:36:38,361 --> 00:36:40,386
You can pack some
to take with you, if you'd like.

521
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,159
Heartless pricks.

522
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,726
Out front in 20.

523
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:06,252
Here they come!

524
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,321
Thank you, Daddy.

525
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:19,834
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

526
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:25,632
Mom!

527
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:28,769
You came this close to almost
making your goal.

528
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:31,781
- Have a great time, sweetheart.
- I'll call you when we land.

529
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:36,442
Bye, Grandpa.

530
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:42,187
Say hi to Don Ho.

531
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:48,260
I love you.

532
00:37:48,298 --> 00:37:49,993
What the fuck?!

533
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,797
- Let's go, John.
- What? Wait a second.

534
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,400
- Let's go.
- Stand back, please.

535
00:37:59,442 --> 00:38:01,171
Can you let my daughter
leave at least?

536
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:04,305
- Daddy, what's happening?
- I will not ask you again.

537
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:08,812
- You motherfucker.
- Oh my God.

538
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:11,116
- What are you doing?
- Get your hands off him.

539
00:38:11,154 --> 00:38:12,746
Jesus Christ! Is that
fucking necessary?

540
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:15,781
Stand back. Now!

541
00:38:18,662 --> 00:38:20,653
John.

542
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,633
Wait.

543
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:36,502
Mom! Oh God.
Oh God!

544
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:39,141
- Is she all right?
- Ginny!

545
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:41,207
Oh my God!

546
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:43,481
Put her head back.
Let me check her airway.

547
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:47,312
Go.

548
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:50,326
I'll tell you one thing, and I'm
not ashamed to say it,

549
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,352
my estimation
of John Sacrimoni as a man

550
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:55,830
just fucking plummeted.

551
00:38:55,865 --> 00:38:57,833
Give him a break,
will ya?

552
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:59,835
It's an emotional day.

553
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:02,394
To cry like a woman?
It's a fucking disgrace.

554
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:05,306
His fucking coach
turned into a pumpkin.

555
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:07,572
Even Cinderella
didn't cry.

556
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,078
When it comes to daughters,
all bets are off.

557
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:12,240
I've seen tougher guys
than John cry at weddings.

558
00:39:12,282 --> 00:39:14,409
Well, let me
ask you this,

559
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:17,545
if they can make him cry
and if he's that weak,

560
00:39:17,587 --> 00:39:19,680
what the fuck else
can they make him do?

561
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:21,054
I gotta agree
with Phil, Ton'.

562
00:39:21,091 --> 00:39:22,683
Oh, you do, do you?

563
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:26,355
Terrible out there, huh?
Poor guy.

564
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:28,796
He's an emotional man.
He loves his daughter.

565
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:33,027
I want to give you
a home, take care of you.

566
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:34,764
Love you.

567
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:36,362
Oh, Steve.

568
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:39,466
You don't know me.

569
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:41,500
I still love...

570
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:45,747
Where are you going?

571
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:48,376
- I gotta make some collections.
- Now?

572
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,886
- I thought you were sick.
- Go to bed.

573
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:55,755
I'll see you later.

574
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:58,386
Maybe too much.

575
00:39:58,428 --> 00:40:00,521
Don't think
I want any less.

576
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:02,053
Do you love me?

577
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:05,556
I think I do.

578
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:22,884
We have been
very lucky, Tony.

579
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:25,444
The house, the kids,

580
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:28,082
what we just went through
at the hospital.

581
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,790
You make
your own luck in life.

582
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:40,592
I'll stop by tomorrow.

583
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:35,816
What do you got
for me, Nicky?

584
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:38,384
Let met get my wallet.

585
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:45,958
Fucking skeeve,
this shit.

586
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:05,786
What's a guy gotta do
to buy you a drink?

587
00:42:05,822 --> 00:42:08,120
You just did it.

588
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:13,957
Vito?

589
00:42:13,997 --> 00:42:15,862
What the fuck?

590
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:17,833
- Sal, hey.
- Fuck you doing?

591
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:21,667
Nothing. I was here.
It's a joke.

592
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:24,104
- You're a fucking fag?
- Watch it, buddy.

593
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,165
You fucking watch it,
cupcake.

594
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:29,201
- Guys, come on. It's okay.
- You think so?

595
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:31,440
Sal, please,
it's a fucking joke.

596
00:42:31,481 --> 00:42:34,848
Right, sure.
Say hi to your wife.

597
00:42:34,884 --> 00:42:38,183
I'm serious.
I'm... Sal, please.

598
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:43,116
Don't say nothing, Sal!

599
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:46,219
Fuck those jerks.
What do you care what they think?

600
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,590
What? Leave me
the fuck alone.

601
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:07,075
- Honey.
- Go back to sleep.

602
00:43:07,116 --> 00:43:09,141
I'm gonna
take a shower.

603
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:25,418
- Hello.
- Is Sil there?

604
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:27,554
Vito Spatafore.

605
00:44:31,768 --> 00:44:34,965
- Hello.
- What do you know? What do you say?

606
00:44:35,004 --> 00:44:36,801
What do I know?
What do I say?

607
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:40,639
It's three o-fucking clock.
Is Tony all right?

608
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:43,202
That's why I'm calling you.
Checking in.

609
00:44:43,246 --> 00:44:45,714
Last I saw,
he was having dessert.

610
00:44:45,748 --> 00:44:48,182
All right, then.

611
00:44:48,217 --> 00:44:50,742
- Everything else okay?
- Yeah.

612
00:44:50,787 --> 00:44:53,381
Call me on my cell,
you need anything.

613
00:45:15,111 --> 00:45:17,079
The point is they made me
take off my shoes,

614
00:45:17,113 --> 00:45:20,082
and I nearly passed out in front
of everybody trying to bend over.

615
00:45:20,116 --> 00:45:22,949
- Well, that's not good.
- People misinterpret.

616
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:25,453
They think you're weak,
they see an opportunity.

617
00:45:25,488 --> 00:45:27,046
They're my friends,

618
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:30,082
a lot of them, but they're also
fucking jackals.

619
00:45:30,126 --> 00:45:31,787
- Alpha male.
- It's subtle,

620
00:45:31,828 --> 00:45:34,353
but since I been back,
I been noticing certain looks

621
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:37,855
and people questioning my judgment
where they never did before.

622
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,768
Sure, cat's away,
bad habits set in.

623
00:45:44,774 --> 00:45:46,742
In a perfect world

624
00:45:46,776 --> 00:45:48,539
I just relax,

625
00:45:48,578 --> 00:45:51,809
let them think whatever
the fuck they want.

626
00:45:51,848 --> 00:45:54,078
Act as if.

627
00:45:54,117 --> 00:45:57,814
As if you're not
feeling vulnerable.

628
00:45:57,854 --> 00:46:00,254
As if you're
the same old Anthony.

629
00:46:00,289 --> 00:46:02,814
Strong, "I'm sure,"
decisive.

630
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:06,955
People see only what
you allow them to see.

631
00:46:06,996 --> 00:46:10,932
Yeah, I been thinking
the same thing.

632
00:46:13,803 --> 00:46:15,771
Thanks for the advice.

633
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:18,603
Glad to be of service.

634
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:20,768
Bring that.
Come on, come on, come on!

635
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,801
Where you going?

636
00:46:49,372 --> 00:46:52,603
Ho, get the skip
a chair.

637
00:46:52,642 --> 00:46:55,440
I don't want a chair.
I'm fine.

638
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:58,174
Ton', how you doing?

639
00:46:58,214 --> 00:47:01,809
- What are you weighing these days?
- Don't ask. 265.

640
00:47:05,354 --> 00:47:07,345
Let's go.

641
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:25,403
Hey, what's up, Ton'?

642
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:28,171
- Skip.
- Hey, boss.

643
00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:35,517
You talk to Vito?

644
00:47:35,551 --> 00:47:38,816
Huh? I called him two times.
He never called me back.

645
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,755
You try the house?

646
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:42,849
'Cause he called me
just the other night.

647
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,552
Hungry, T.? You want, I'll have
Bissell fix you a sandwich.

648
00:47:47,597 --> 00:47:49,827
No no, I'm good.
I'm good.

649
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:49,958
What's your
fucking problem?

650
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:52,222
Huh?

651
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:54,627
What the fuck
is your problem?

652
00:48:54,664 --> 00:48:56,928
Slamming the goddamn
refrigerator door.

653
00:48:56,966 --> 00:48:59,799
- What? No.
- Are you gonna argue with me now?

654
00:48:59,835 --> 00:49:01,803
I didn't even
open the refrigerator.

655
00:49:01,837 --> 00:49:03,566
The Coke was out
on the counter.

656
00:49:03,606 --> 00:49:07,770
So you are gonna
argue with me, huh, you fucking mutt?

657
00:49:09,045 --> 00:49:11,411
Look, Tony,
I don't wanna...

658
00:49:11,447 --> 00:49:13,813
You don't wanna what?
You don't wanna what?

659
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:17,383
This fucking guy, huh?

660
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:21,114
Fucking Philadelphia
lawyer.

661
00:49:24,226 --> 00:49:25,955
Jesus!

662
00:49:25,995 --> 00:49:29,453
- Don't do it!
- No, don't do it!

663
00:49:29,498 --> 00:49:31,864
My arm!

664
00:49:42,044 --> 00:49:44,308
How's that, huh?

665
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:46,645
You got
anything else to say?

666
00:50:00,763 --> 00:50:02,754
Get up.
