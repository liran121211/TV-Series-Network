1
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:07,287
"Diary of a Thin Man."

2
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:10,818
- Where you been?
- Hospital, helping Carmela.

3
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:13,024
The devotion
that kid shows.

4
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:15,556
I just think of
my Marie, the kids,

5
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:18,365
in that situation,
God forbid.

6
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:22,362
My ma... who the fuck would take care
of her something happens?

7
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:24,671
Except Sil and you guys.

8
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:31,778
Colombians knock off
at noon.

9
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:34,047
Then it's empty.

10
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:37,846
Manager's unit's
down a flight.

11
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,707
- Who's in there?
- Open it.

12
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:10,016
What the fuck?

13
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:13,457
Get back!

14
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:18,123
- Shoot the prick.
- Get the fuck out of the way.

15
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:27,864
Cocksucking miserable
spic shit!

16
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,840
It's supposed to be
empty here daytimes.

17
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,742
Jesus, my fucking balls!

18
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:39,242
The money!

19
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:41,445
Fuck, my fucking balls.

20
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:43,750
- Oogatz here.
- The freeze.

21
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:48,025
Nothing.

22
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,688
Come on, let's blow.
Lot of fucking noise we made.

23
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:52,720
Fuck that.

24
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,199
Close the goddamn door.

25
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:14,743
This fucking shit
for a lousy two Gs?

26
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,958
Oh, Anthony.

27
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,261
- Hi, Uncle Bobby.
- Hiya, sweetheart.

28
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,768
Cugin'.

29
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:32,793
I'm gonna go ahead.

30
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,440
What's up?

31
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:38,739
You were at South Mountain
Arena yesterday

32
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:41,177
trying to buy a gun
from that asshole in the snack shop.

33
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:42,578
Who told you that?

34
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:44,639
We know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

35
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:47,083
I can't believe you know this.
Who told you this?

36
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:49,781
Look, if my pops was
laying in there shot up

37
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:52,187
- I'd be thinking the same thing.
- But you can't go there.

38
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:54,192
- Yeah, why the fuck not?
- Listen to me,

39
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:57,024
I'm your uncle.
A. Junior's in federal lockup.

40
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:58,893
No one's getting
to him there.

41
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,898
Well, it's difficult,
but not impossible.

42
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:03,696
Trust me. Your dad does not want
you to get involved.

43
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:07,535
You gotta channel that rage elsewheres.
Golden Gloves.

44
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:10,200
- What?
- Dumbbells or something.

45
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:11,869
Fuck your girlfriend more.

46
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,676
You little hothead here.

47
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:35,498
- Hey.
- Hi.

48
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:37,661
Did you park in emergency
or in the garage?

49
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:39,694
What's going on
in there?

50
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:43,139
They're on rounds or something,
Dr. Plepler and the Indian girl.

51
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:48,543
Hi, did you bring me
my sweater?

52
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,482
Your sweater?
Man, Jesus, fuck!

53
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:55,543
All right, take it easy.
What is your problem?

54
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:57,555
My problem is I'm old enough
to sit with Dad all night,

55
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:59,853
be a messenger boy,
bring shit from the house,

56
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:01,756
but I'm too young to deal
with the larger issues?

57
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:04,785
- What are you talking about?
- Like you didn't put them up to it.

58
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,060
Put who up to what?

59
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:11,935
God, he was in such
a good mood this morning.

60
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:17,899
I told the nurse

61
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:20,241
that I thought he moved
his eyebrows at around 5:30.

62
00:06:20,278 --> 00:06:23,736
Did she pass that along?
'Cause if not, I'm gonna be furious.

63
00:06:23,782 --> 00:06:26,046
Mrs. Soprano, you're really
gonna have to recalibrate

64
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,518
your expectations
at this point.

65
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:31,078
We can't even maintain
his blood pressure

66
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,556
at a level that we'd like.

67
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:35,719
Until his fever dissipates
and his white cell count comes down,

68
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,353
we're a long way from home.

69
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,091
But he's really fighting.

70
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:49,065
Mom, he's really strong.

71
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,972
That is true.

72
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:59,547
Hi, Dad.

73
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:35,782
Monastery?

75
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:08,046
I, uh...

76
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:11,522
I received these
this morning.

77
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:15,825
Do I really look
that much like this guy?

78
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:19,228
To a certain extent,
all Caucasians look alike.

79
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:21,960
Look,
I'm not Finnerty.

80
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,798
I didn't sell you
this heating equipment.

81
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:27,862
But I am kind of worried about what
I might have done.

82
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:32,735
Because you see,
yesterday...

83
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:35,610
Yes, tell us, there's no fraud
without a fairy tale.

84
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:38,548
Yesterday, I was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's.

85
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,210
Oh, my.

86
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:43,380
And I'm in this
strange city and...

87
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:45,855
Please come inside.

88
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:52,186
I came here because
I thought

89
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,597
you could help me
reach Finnerty.

90
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:59,627
Now I have his wallet.
I have his briefcase, but I'm not him.

91
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,971
Excuse the brothers
for laughing.

92
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,069
One day we will
all die,

93
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:09,774
and then we'll be
the same as that tree.

94
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:11,372
No me, no you.

95
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:15,318
Be that as it may,
we need heat.

96
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:18,117
We need to find someone who will
take responsibility.

97
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:20,215
Well, I can't do that.

98
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:22,089
Then the lawsuit proceeds.

99
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,804
Hey, go home, I'll stay.

100
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:40,834
I just had Chinese food.

101
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:49,811
- Carmela?
- Oh Dr. Melfi, hi. How are you?

102
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:52,049
How are you is more the point.

103
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,888
In fact I'm running around crazy.
My son was supposed to get coffee,

104
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:58,362
or tell the maid to.
It's the one thing I have to have.

105
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:01,758
I got your note.
It was so thoughtful.

106
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,597
I've been calling
the hospital

107
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:05,830
and they say that
Anthony's stabilized.

108
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,269
That's what they say.

109
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,398
If you or anyone
needs anything,

110
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:12,774
to talk or to run
interference with the doctors,

111
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,712
- don't hesitate to call.
- I appreciate that. Thank you.

112
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:18,682
I have plenty of people
around I can talk to.

113
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:22,278
Of course.
Good luck.

114
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,487
- Morning, Gab. Is he ready?
- He's eating.

115
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,464
We're picking up
Mrs. S. at 10:00.

116
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:37,332
I saw her Tuesday.
How's she holding up, poor thing?

117
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:39,496
Not so hotso, really.

118
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:41,528
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

119
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:47,642
You hear about the thing
in the old neighborhood?

120
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,579
I'm not busy enough
for all this?

121
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:53,448
Couple of guys left three
on the floor in some Colombian laundry.

122
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,812
Thank you.

123
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:01,982
Two guys we know,
huh?

124
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:03,654
Total bloodbath.

125
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:06,858
Somebody said a million plus.
What a score.

126
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,627
Fuckin' A.

127
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:12,501
- Sil, Benny says you have to go.
- Yeah, all right.

128
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:15,199
Listen, don't forget...

129
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,731
Oh, honey,
your asthma kicking up?

130
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:19,937
Springtime.

131
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:23,072
Pollen's out of control.

132
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:26,447
- I am so proud of you.
- Acting boss.

133
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,645
I hoped the day
would never come.

134
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,746
You've always
sold yourself short.

135
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:34,190
You know, that's not what I mean.
You know me.

136
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:36,420
All I ever wanted
was to carve out a little piece,

137
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:38,554
enjoy some grandkids.

138
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,996
But how many guys
could step into Tony's shoes

139
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:43,523
- and do the job you're doing?
- You think?

140
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:45,559
You have such strength
in crisis.

141
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:48,037
Benny told me
he feels honored to drive you.

142
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:51,236
You're firm about what you want without
being obnoxious about it.

143
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:55,508
Sil, have you asked
yourself what happens

144
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:58,038
if, God forbid,
Tony Soprano doesn't recover?

145
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:07,215
Listen, Gab,
I never talk to you about my work.

146
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:08,816
And?

147
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,294
I'm gonna tell you something
I never told anybody.

148
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:13,923
Back when Jackie
was at the end,

149
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:17,093
he floated the idea
of me stepping up to the big seat.

150
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:19,695
Not Tony, me.

151
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:23,037
- Really?
- Yeah, but I thought...

152
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:25,599
- it's not for me.
- Still, you wouldn't sneeze at it.

153
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:28,237
I never saw myself
as that kind of guy.

154
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:30,110
I'm more behind
the scenes...

155
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:33,914
advice, strategy.

156
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,319
But here you are, Sil.

157
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:39,380
The times make
the man, honey,

158
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:43,326
not the other way around.

159
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:46,387
Asians flip for horror films.
Plus, there's ancillary...

160
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:49,595
No change with Tony.

161
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:52,034
Carmela's in goddamn pieces.

162
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,971
Memo, get some coffee
up to Carmela's house.

163
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:00,974
Listen Sil, Bobby was making collections
up in Roseville again last night.

164
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:03,879
My time is limited.
Get him over and let's resolve this.

165
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:15,192
- How's the skip doing?
- Same.

166
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:17,524
You forget something,
like my cut?

167
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:20,292
You believe this guy? You should've
lost some weight in that nose,

168
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,128
keep it out
of everybody's business.

169
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,192
I'm working on it.

170
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:27,705
It's these fucking
flowers right here.

171
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:30,299
Get this shit out of here.

172
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,411
That was Junior's
neighborhood, so now it's mine.

173
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,315
Keep your voice down here.

174
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:43,718
A va' Napoli...
it was Eugene's going on three years.

175
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,245
And Eugene was with me.

176
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,814
You should have never
had it to begin with,

177
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:48,723
except for the beef with
the Tastee Freez route.

178
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,887
Junior ruled on it,
and it wasn't right then.

179
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:52,829
This fucking guy.

180
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:54,798
Easy.

181
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,427
- How much we talking about?
- Three Gs a week.

182
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:59,766
Maybe that's what that miserab'
admitted to you.

183
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:01,965
- I heard five.
- You heard wrong.

184
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:04,031
What do we do here, Sil?

185
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:10,873
- Here's the thing.
- What, skip?

186
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:13,406
For the time being,
it's Bobby's.

187
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:18,552
But he's still gonna
kick up to you 20%.

188
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,990
- How long's for the time being?
- Yeah, Sil.

189
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:23,619
What, do you speak Norwegian?

190
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:27,427
For now. We'll see
how much is there.

191
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,903
Hi, everyone.
My God, you poor thing.

192
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:38,102
Hey, we just need
some Irish Spring.

193
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:46,206
Good morning.

194
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,521
Another one?

195
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,630
Know what I
found out yesterday?

196
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:11,164
What's that?

197
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,644
Thank you.

198
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,140
I was diagnosed
actually...

199
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:22,482
with Alzheimer's.

200
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,920
Man, I'm sorry
to hear that.

201
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,850
My uncle has
memory loss.

202
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:32,760
Maybe it's hereditary.

203
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:35,527
Someone's probably
studying that.

204
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:42,799
Is it possible

205
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,967
that I am Kevin Finnerty?

206
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:48,339
All right, I'll stop.

207
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:52,370
- Sil.
- What?

208
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,640
You heard about this
Orange Street takedown?

209
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:57,204
The Colombians?
That you?

210
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:58,772
My guy had the tip.

211
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:01,080
Should be a nice
chunk for everybody.

212
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,212
Everybody?

213
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:06,519
Carmela, she gets T's cut under
the circumstances, correct?

214
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:09,025
It's your call.

215
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,051
I know it's
my fucking call.

216
00:17:14,499 --> 00:17:16,592
Yes, that is
the correct thing.

217
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:20,602
Oh, ladies' room's
next door.

218
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:22,572
I can reach it
from here.

219
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:25,075
Grim fucking scene,
that ICU.

220
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:28,078
She's one brave lady.

221
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:31,604
I was just saying, I'm gonna get
T's piece of my half to Sil for her.

222
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:34,083
- Of the thing.
- Back up there, Bluto.

223
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:36,279
Your half? I did
all the heavy lifting.

224
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,686
You would never have
heard about it without my information.

225
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,691
Big help.
It was fucking mayhem.

226
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:42,192
You said the place
was empty.

227
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:45,195
Doc says I need an ultrasound on
my groin and balls.

228
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:47,720
Sil, you wanna
weigh in here?

229
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,129
It breaks
half and half.

230
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:57,005
You both kick Tony's
to me to deal with.

231
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:00,636
I'll have it for you,
Sil, the whole 80K.

232
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:04,307
Ho, ho, ho, 80K?
How's that 20% of a million?

233
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:07,408
Have a cookie, you're delirious.
It was 750, tops.

234
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:10,114
Fuck it all, Paulie.
Tommy cased that shithole.

235
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:13,089
What's with the fucking
accounting out there?

236
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:15,456
That's a 100 grand apiece.
You got it?

237
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:17,654
We're looking
after Carmela.

238
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,856
- No question.
- Of course.

239
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:22,365
Sooner than later,
Paulie.

240
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,301
I gotta piss first.
You want half of that, too?

241
00:18:32,043 --> 00:18:34,603
In a prior incarnation,
I would

242
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:36,306
get my load on,

243
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:39,077
blow 20 residuals
at the track.

244
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:42,109
As writers,

245
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:45,782
we are all hung up.

246
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:48,257
But we are also
hung up

247
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,692
on our own hang-up.

248
00:18:50,728 --> 00:18:53,788
We mythologize
our inner narrative.

249
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:56,766
Take for example,
"Beowulf."

250
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:58,826
Who is Grendel,

251
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,862
but the habit,
the disease.

252
00:19:01,906 --> 00:19:04,636
Ah, fresh casualties

253
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:06,267
in the battle
of the blank page.

254
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,177
Welcome to the Writer's Guild.
Have a seat.

255
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:12,273
Take me...

256
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:15,114
my past as an addict.

257
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:21,482
Get the fuck up!
Come on!

258
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,096
Give me that
fucking fisheye.

259
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:29,793
I'm offering you a way to wipe
your fucking obligation.

260
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,064
Wasn't me who told you
to start gambling again.

261
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:35,937
I can't write a feature now.
I just landed a staff job.

262
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:39,374
People are seeing huge profits
with these digital horror movies.

263
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,708
Douchebags who never
made a film before.

264
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:44,510
That "Saw" thing,
400 grand to make,

265
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:47,313
took in 100 mil
worldwide.

266
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:50,184
I'm 100% well.

267
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:53,622
I deliver this script,
I owe you nothing?

268
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:55,592
You hear this dude?
100% well.

269
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:57,651
He's a bad boy, huh,
with that lingo?

270
00:19:57,695 --> 00:20:00,095
Real fucking
dark character.

271
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:04,932
My idea is "Saw" meets
"Godfather 2."

272
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:08,200
Proven track record,
both genres.

273
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:10,207
Young wiseguy,
assassin,

274
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:12,175
gets betrayed by his people.
They whack him,

275
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,611
leave his body parts
in dumpsters all around the city.

276
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:19,047
Long story short,
he is put back together by science,

277
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,744
or maybe it's supernatural.

278
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:24,152
And he gets fucking payback on everyone
who fucked him over,

279
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:26,156
including the cunt
he was engaged to.

280
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,750
She was getting porked by his boss
the night the hero was killed.

281
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:32,262
We'll have a meeting
tomorrow.

282
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:34,958
We hear what you've fleshed
out before we go to script.

283
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:36,864
Bing, 2:30.

284
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,892
Don't make me
come look for you.

285
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:59,984
An entire room
full of writers,

286
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:02,686
and you did nothing!

287
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,299
Sir, it's family only
in the unit.

288
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:12,302
I'll be out of your hair
in a minute, sister.

289
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:15,965
I keep telling you people, I'm gonna
have to call the hospital administrator.

290
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:27,681
I wanted to let you know
there's a major package coming your way

291
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:30,482
from Paulie and Vito,
very significant.

292
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:33,388
You all have done
so much already.

293
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:36,018
Yeah, we just found out insurance won't pay
for physical therapy.

294
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,655
Bastards.
So thank you.

295
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:41,927
You wanna come in,
say hello?

296
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:45,060
Uh, sure.

297
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:07,855
- Hello, Father.
- Silvio.

298
00:22:24,508 --> 00:22:26,840
I have Napoleons,

299
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:29,038
but I also got fruit
for a certain party.

300
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,015
Either's good.
The program says sugar after meals

301
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:34,574
- tells the body you're full.
- When you married my cousin,

302
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:37,246
everybody used to say you
looked like John Travolta.

303
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:40,223
He's almost back
to his white suit.

304
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:49,866
The Bacala question.

305
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,265
Bobby don't have
any claim.

306
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:54,931
I don't know why Sil ruled so
half-assed on you. It's not my style.

307
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:56,405
He's worried more
about taking care of Carmela

308
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,670
- than the actual fucking earners.
- Please.

309
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:02,008
With Johnny awaiting trial and the feds
freezing his assets,

310
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:04,606
who do you think's
keeping Ginny in butter brickle?

311
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:08,311
I mean lucky for me, those last years
I was in the can,

312
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:11,913
my kid brother Billy
took care of Patty and the grandkids.

313
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:17,789
Only to have that
motherfucking animal Blundetto...

314
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:19,921
Don't do it to yourself, Philly.

315
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:24,694
It's hard to forget.

316
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:27,761
I don't forget.

317
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:37,414
I forget what
we were talking about.

318
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:39,882
Me too.
What the fuck was it?

319
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,908
Oh, yeah, Jesus.

320
00:23:41,952 --> 00:23:44,045
Carmela.
The thing is...

321
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:46,022
You want coffee, coz?

322
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:48,024
If you're already
making it.

323
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:50,049
Hot water
and lemon, hon.

324
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,024
Honestly...

325
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:57,056
how can I short Carmela?

326
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:00,834
Maybe I'm not following you.

327
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:03,669
I'm as supportive as the next guy,
but there's a point.

328
00:24:03,707 --> 00:24:06,904
And what if Tony takes a turn
for the worse?

329
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:09,742
I'm gonna hand her
$100,000,

330
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,749
and he dies the next day?

331
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:14,751
Be money down the drain.

332
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:17,686
It's tempting,
but you can't think that way.

333
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:24,219
You all set now?

334
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:27,196
Yeah, I'm living it up here.

335
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,199
You still stewing
about that money?

336
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:30,996
Spend some, you'll get over it.

337
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:33,595
I'll never get over it.

338
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:36,162
Certain people,
let me tell you.

339
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:38,004
Oh, come on,
not Sil again.

340
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:40,510
Carmela.
He's a fucking vegetable.

341
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:43,638
But I still gotta pay
tribute to the princess of Little Italy.

342
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:47,811
- The boss' wife. What are you gonna do?
- Fuck her.

343
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,801
I'm on my way in now.

344
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:08,293
Yeah, good, and you might want to take
care of that thing we talked about.

345
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:09,806
Which thing?

346
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,831
That big piece of pie
you were bringing to the hospital

347
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:13,901
she's expecting you,
so make it happen.

348
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:15,036
What are you worried about?

349
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,639
I think I know who
I'm fucking dealing with here.

350
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:18,943
I resent that.

351
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:20,814
You have a problem
taking orders from me?

352
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:23,342
Keep your shirt on.
It's done.

353
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:35,895
Don't get in bed with him again.
You dislodged his drains.

354
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:38,834
That was my daughter.

355
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:42,100
And I can't help but think
that physical affection means something.

356
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,345
They refrigerate this place, huh?

357
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,658
There you go.

358
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:25,215
What are you still
doing out there?

359
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,217
I got involved
in a lawsuit.

360
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:29,617
- A lawsuit?
- Could create problems later.

361
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:32,986
What kind of lawsuit?

362
00:26:33,023 --> 00:26:34,820
Hello.

363
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:37,793
- Also...
- What?

364
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:40,388
I had an accident.
I fell down some stairs.

365
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:42,228
Oh, my God!

366
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:44,291
The doctor said...

367
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,000
What did he say?

368
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,439
"Mild concussion,"
he said.

369
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:53,443
Told me I'd be okay.

370
00:26:53,477 --> 00:26:56,571
That's it.
I'm coming out there.

371
00:26:56,614 --> 00:27:00,914
My mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.

372
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:05,411
No, don't do that.

373
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,447
Are you telling me
everything?

374
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:23,637
JT, I want to introduce you
to Carmine Lupertazzi

375
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:25,801
my co-executive
producer on the project.

376
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:28,641
Nice to finally meet. I heard tidbits
of what Chris has got in mind

377
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,476
the genre and so forth.

378
00:27:30,514 --> 00:27:32,675
But, JT,
I gotta warn you,

379
00:27:32,716 --> 00:27:35,583
I'm very hands-on.
I learned that the hard way.

380
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:40,048
I wanna welcome all
of you to the first meeting

381
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,285
of possible investors
on this project.

382
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:46,524
Some of you know I've had nine pictures
under my subspecies,

383
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:48,793
four in the "South Beach
Strumpet" series alone,

384
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:52,962
each with 30,000-plus
DVDs in print.

385
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:54,732
That being said, I usually find it
helpful at this stage

386
00:27:54,772 --> 00:27:57,172
to include my
prospective partners

387
00:27:57,207 --> 00:28:02,076
and get your inputs
or notes as we call them.

388
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:04,444
JT, you're on.

389
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,142
Well...

390
00:28:09,186 --> 00:28:12,246
we've been working on a new
kind of slasher film.

391
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:14,484
It takes place
in the world of...

392
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:16,220
you know...

393
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:20,363
um, the mafia.

394
00:28:20,397 --> 00:28:23,764
It's about a wiseguy with a big mouth
and bigger dreams.

395
00:28:25,035 --> 00:28:28,732
Anyway, they call him
"The Butcher."

396
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:31,400
- No, they don't.
- Why the fuck not?

397
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:35,003
Need I remind you
of a certain butcher out of A.C.?

398
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:36,512
Right.

399
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:38,447
Not "Butcher."
Go on, JT.

400
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:41,007
So, right.

401
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:43,884
He's kind of
outshining his boss.

402
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:47,084
So the guy has him clipped,
but he's still alive

403
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:48,955
when they cut him up.

404
00:28:48,992 --> 00:28:51,256
He's gonna feel
that the next day.

405
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,392
Right.
So at the dump,

406
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:57,832
his body
reassembles itself,

407
00:28:57,868 --> 00:28:59,836
all except for
a hand that got crushed.

408
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,328
So he ties a cleaver
onto the stump

409
00:29:03,373 --> 00:29:07,207
and he goes out
to get revenge on everyone,

410
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:09,644
especially the boss, which
is a pretty solid role.

411
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,081
Right now it's called
"Pork Store Killer."

412
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:15,312
But I'm thinking...

413
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:17,616
just...

414
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:19,645
"Cleaver."

415
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,819
I'm confused.
You said he's dead.

416
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:28,593
How's he evening up with anybody?
He's a ghost?

417
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:32,090
As I understood,
a zombie of sorts.

418
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:34,104
Great title,
by the way.

419
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:36,265
But if they jointed him,

420
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:39,901
he's not gonna end up
all in the same dump.

421
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:42,411
- And how's that a slasher film?
- What are you talking about?

422
00:29:42,446 --> 00:29:45,609
A slasher.
A couple of kids naked in a lake.

423
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:48,516
Certified maniac
on the loose, not a ghost.

424
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:51,544
Actually, the maniac is almost always
a supernatural force.

425
00:29:51,588 --> 00:29:54,022
Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers
from "Halloween."

426
00:29:54,057 --> 00:29:55,684
Get the fuck out.

427
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:58,490
Easy, Sil, easy.
He's making a point.

428
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:01,657
Michael Myers is
an escaped mental patient.

429
00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:03,632
Jason and Freddy,
different kind of movie.

430
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,658
Well, that's the kind
we're doing here.

431
00:30:05,702 --> 00:30:09,160
"Saw," "The Ring", they made millions.
And that's not even including

432
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:11,197
"The Godfather" angle,
which we got here.

433
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:13,732
What if...

434
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:19,338
they disposed him
at stops

435
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:22,352
that happened
to be along the same route?

436
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:25,184
Then he would all end up
in the same dump.

437
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:30,986
But he's a ghost?
I don't know.

438
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:33,792
"Ghostbusters", another fucking
money machine.

439
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:39,566
Cavalry's here.
I brought some cannelloni.

440
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:41,070
Again.

441
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:43,436
It's got bechamel
on it,

442
00:30:43,473 --> 00:30:45,737
so five, six hours
out of the fridge, tops.

443
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:47,641
Thank you.

444
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:49,669
- Hey.
- Howdy.

445
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:53,183
Look at her.

446
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:57,051
That word "plucky,"
is that what it means?

447
00:30:57,087 --> 00:30:58,748
Only, when do I get to spend
some face time with the skip?

448
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:01,349
Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.

449
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:03,416
...in this mob family
domestic shooting,

450
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,226
which some observers note carries
the echoes of the death of soul great

451
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,824
Marvin Gaye.

452
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:12,165
As 20-year-old Anthony
Soprano Jr. himself

453
00:31:12,202 --> 00:31:16,002
told our Amy Kean,
"Growing up Soprano,

454
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:18,735
it's just plain weird."

455
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:20,640
You just wanna bite it!

456
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:22,872
Big Lots! What's your
deal today?

457
00:31:22,913 --> 00:31:24,904
Carmela?

458
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:31,786
I swear to God,
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

459
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:33,551
- What the fuck?
- You made a fool of yourself

460
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,684
and our family on national
fucking television?

461
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:38,251
I didn't even say
that shit.

462
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:40,195
And they totally
misquoted me.

463
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,858
- Holy shit.
- Well, of course they did.

464
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,700
That's what they do, which is why I
and everybody else

465
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:49,297
told you, "Don't talk
to the press!"

466
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,307
You're the one
who looked like a total asshole.

467
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:53,332
Dragging me around like
I was five years old.

468
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:55,902
You are a cross to bear.
That's all you are.

469
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:58,073
To your father, to me,
to everybody.

470
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:01,482
Fuck this.
Fuck it all!

471
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:06,780
Jesus, Mel, the hell's
wrong with you?

472
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:10,782
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?!

473
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:12,761
Mom.

474
00:32:15,832 --> 00:32:18,357
It had to happen.
She's fried.

475
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,853
You have any
extra compensation

476
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,856
for what you've been
going through?

477
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,881
Nah, part of the job.

478
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:44,155
Like they say,

479
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:46,788
with great power comes
great responsibility.

480
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:52,231
You know, Vito called me
"skip" the other day.

481
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:54,066
Really?

482
00:32:54,104 --> 00:32:57,733
Slip of the tongue, no doubt,
but I noticed he didn't correct himself.

483
00:32:57,774 --> 00:33:00,072
See?

484
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,010
If it did become
permanent,

485
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:04,639
- your compensation might be...
- Don't go there.

486
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:13,519
Hi, Gab.
I need Sil for a second.

487
00:33:13,557 --> 00:33:15,855
Can you keep it short?
He's pretty beat.

488
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:20,527
This better be
important, Bobby.

489
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:23,556
Got a new baby and two kids
in private school.

490
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,898
This arrangement
with Vito is killing me.

491
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:27,597
It's 9:30 at night.

492
00:33:27,637 --> 00:33:30,731
Bobby, I don't remember
what the fuck it was.

493
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:33,174
Roseville,
this temporary shit.

494
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,179
I need an answer already.
I'm going out of my fucking mind here.

495
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:37,908
I'm liable to do
something drastic.

496
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:40,883
Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.

497
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:47,454
Mornings are better.

498
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:52,120
I'll come up
with a solution.

499
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:54,790
I don't want you
to worry about it.

500
00:33:59,403 --> 00:34:02,770
I must have sounded odd
at the supermarket the other day.

501
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:07,377
See, you're
Tony's therapist.

502
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:09,811
Whether it's appropriate...

503
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:13,247
How can I help you?

504
00:34:13,283 --> 00:34:15,615
It's about my son.

505
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:18,519
Both kids, really.

506
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:22,719
The situation
with the shooting.

507
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:24,727
I'm very worried
about them.

508
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:26,786
Sure.

509
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:30,596
It's a very
serious problem,

510
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:33,034
you know, guns
in the home.

511
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,504
It's a societal concern.

512
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:39,236
Obviously, we learned
our lesson too late.

513
00:34:39,276 --> 00:34:42,268
I immediately removed
all the firearms from the house

514
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:45,543
after the goings-on
at Tony's uncle's.

515
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:49,848
Anyway, last night,
I was shrieking

516
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:52,446
at my son,

517
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:56,016
and I said something...
I said something very cruel.

518
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:02,897
And especially since
he's been trying so hard.

519
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:05,959
How are you doing?

520
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:10,262
You know,
I'm frazzled certainly,

521
00:35:10,307 --> 00:35:12,537
but I am more
worried about them.

522
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:14,908
They're not kids anymore.

523
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:16,913
When they were young,

524
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,643
there were certain things
we could tell them about Tony's life.

525
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:22,584
You know, lies.
We'll just call them what they were.

526
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,487
- But now...
- So the issue isn't just

527
00:35:26,523 --> 00:35:28,514
guns in the home.

528
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:37,726
Honestly, I think about my son
in front of those cameras,

529
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:40,497
having to vouch
for all this.

530
00:35:40,537 --> 00:35:42,630
My daughter
and her friends.

531
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:47,200
They have to face
all these years of facading.

532
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:50,304
They do or you do?

533
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:55,649
The minute I met Tony,
I knew who that guy was.

534
00:35:55,685 --> 00:35:59,280
On my second date, he brought me
and my mother each a dozen roses

535
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:02,189
and my father
a $200 power drill.

536
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:06,924
Not the typical story
of young love.

537
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:12,764
And I don't know
if I loved him in spite of it...

538
00:36:16,406 --> 00:36:18,670
or because of it.

539
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,202
And my parents
weren't like that.

540
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:27,045
And I knew, you know, whether
consciously or not,

541
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,710
I knew that behind
that power drill,

542
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:30,652
there was probably
some guy with a broken arm,

543
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:32,746
you know, or worse.

544
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:36,725
And you coped
with that, how?

545
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:41,086
You know, I'd go to my priest,
and I would cry,

546
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:43,964
and say how bad I felt
about how my husband made his money,

547
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,094
but that was bullshit.

548
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:50,129
Because there are far bigger crooks
than my husband.

549
00:36:56,012 --> 00:36:58,412
But the kids

550
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:02,248
they don't decide
who they're born to.

551
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,613
So now what?

552
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:10,955
Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?

553
00:37:12,362 --> 00:37:15,092
It's all out in the open now,
the whole thing.

554
00:37:15,131 --> 00:37:17,361
And them, they're not
in grade school anymore.

555
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,368
They become...

556
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:23,099
the longer they stay
with us...

557
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:25,107
Complicit.

558
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:28,076
Oh, God.

559
00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:38,347
Putting aside the moral

560
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:41,414
and legal issues,

561
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:44,985
clarity can't be
a bad thing.

562
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:47,656
Yes.

563
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:57,238
Tony's second night
in the coma, I told him I loved him.

564
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:02,478
When was the last time
I said that?

565
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:12,419
Are you afraid you aren't
going to feel that way

566
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:14,480
when he wakes up?

567
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:21,931
Anthony tells me
things have been

568
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:23,557
better between you.

569
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:33,365
Come here, honey.

570
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,344
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.

571
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:37,812
I can't breathe.

572
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:41,112
- It's all right.
- Come here, honey.

573
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:43,415
Can't breathe.
Can't breathe.

574
00:38:47,223 --> 00:38:51,683
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.

575
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:54,856
- What's going on?
- Would you move your car, please, sir?

576
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:57,696
Sil, I didn't hear
from you.

577
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:03,262
Sil's on the canvas now.

578
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:05,365
Fucking 100% disaster.

579
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:08,002
Point is, Tony goes,

580
00:39:08,044 --> 00:39:10,012
let's face it,

581
00:39:10,046 --> 00:39:12,446
somebody's gonna have to
step into the breach.

582
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,811
I'm a young man.

583
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:18,685
Now without the weight,

584
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:21,418
I'm a healthy man

585
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,517
with longevity.

586
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:34,666
I hear Sil
is at St. Barnabas.

587
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:36,831
My God, what is
happening to us around here?

588
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:39,774
Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.

589
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:41,572
Listen, sweetheart,

590
00:39:41,611 --> 00:39:44,546
I know you're expecting something,
and I can't get into specifics,

591
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:46,947
and Tony wouldn't
want me to,

592
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:51,181
but there are certain people looking
over our shoulders right now.

593
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:53,189
It's okay, Vito.
I'm not expecting anything.

594
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:56,681
Money's not an issue.
Like you said, I got bigger worries,

595
00:39:56,726 --> 00:39:58,421
like this son of mine.

596
00:39:58,461 --> 00:40:01,362
You gotta trust me
on this, hon.

597
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:05,528
Suspicions get raised if we were
to move it to you at this moment.

598
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:08,796
I got this.

599
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,506
Your ma says
now's our moment.

600
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:13,907
The main thing,
when people come to sit with dad,

601
00:40:13,943 --> 00:40:15,911
the doctors want
positive talk.

602
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:18,470
- It helps in his recovery.
- Got it.

603
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,880
Oof, Madonn'
he looks terrible.

604
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:26,013
Uncle Paulie,
you can't say stuff like that.

605
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:28,285
You have to
stay positive.

606
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:30,986
Yeah, it's just
nothing prepares you for that.

607
00:40:31,027 --> 00:40:33,495
Uncle Paulie!

608
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:37,296
Only one person
at a time, please.

609
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:41,298
She's a ballbuster.

610
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:44,465
Allright, Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few minutes, okay?

611
00:40:44,507 --> 00:40:47,203
Remember, stay positive.

612
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:13,934
I gotta wear a jock,
the doc says.

613
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,494
Keep the testes elevated.

614
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:21,772
Of course, it could
be a lot worse, right?

615
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:24,837
They gave me
an ultrasound, no rupture.

616
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:30,319
I mean,
the good thing is

617
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:32,344
I hurt it doing a major
piece of business.

618
00:41:32,388 --> 00:41:34,652
But I saw a little action,

619
00:41:34,691 --> 00:41:38,889
and the next thing,
I was at the urologist.

620
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:41,419
Fucking guy tells
me I can't expect the same things

621
00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:44,297
from my body no more.
I tell you, T,

622
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:46,825
first the eyes,
then the teeth.

623
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,361
Next you find out
you can't take pissing for granted.

624
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:52,067
Some joke, huh?

625
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:55,339
When I was in the service,
I won the chin-ups cup

626
00:41:55,378 --> 00:41:57,642
three weeks in a row.

627
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,910
Fucking beautiful
definition, too.

628
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:02,315
Guy asked me to model
for the boxing poster.

629
00:42:02,352 --> 00:42:06,721
He was half a fag,
but I was flattered just the same.

630
00:42:06,756 --> 00:42:09,350
Now look at this.

631
00:42:09,392 --> 00:42:11,553
Fucking wrinkles like
an old lady's cunt.

632
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:18,590
You don't think it's gonna happen
to you, but I'm feeling it, Ton'.

633
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:26,733
Phineas Fogg
back in town.

634
00:42:26,776 --> 00:42:28,744
He forgets
all the little people.

635
00:42:28,778 --> 00:42:31,975
Hey, Vito,
how's Mr. Soprano doing?

636
00:42:32,015 --> 00:42:35,382
Let's hope he
pulls through, huh?

637
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:40,122
Hi.

638
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:45,717
So glad you're here.

639
00:42:45,762 --> 00:42:48,458
I'm gonna let
you two lovebirds be.

640
00:42:53,403 --> 00:42:56,099
That... don't worry about him.
He's harmless.

641
00:42:58,575 --> 00:43:00,099
That fucking agita, T.

642
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:03,112
I mean, do I blame
myself for this life?

643
00:43:03,146 --> 00:43:05,706
The shit that happens,
like with Puss.

644
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:08,774
Standup one day,
FBI rat fuck the next.

645
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,214
I felt it here, T.

646
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:15,520
- I felt it right here.
- Will you please shut up in there?

647
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:19,461
I'm sorry.

648
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:23,625
Yes, the Inn
at the Oaks.

649
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:27,966
Left on
Jamboree Boulevard?

650
00:43:28,004 --> 00:43:30,564
Out towards the beacon.

651
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:34,365
What is that beacon
anyway?

652
00:43:36,312 --> 00:43:39,509
Oh.
God damn it!

653
00:43:39,549 --> 00:43:41,312
Shut up!
Shut up in there!

654
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:42,841
So I said to Ma...

655
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,354
What the fuck?

656
00:43:52,095 --> 00:43:54,495
Dr. Budraja,
stat to room 3.

657
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,658
Nurse, don't leave!
Help!

658
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:02,827
- Out of the way, sir.
- Oh, my God! What's happening?

659
00:44:02,872 --> 00:44:05,966
Soprano, still V-tach
on the monitor.

660
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:07,874
- Thready pulse.
- Take his pressure. Get a board ready.

661
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,879
- 80 palp.
- All right, let's bag him.

662
00:44:10,913 --> 00:44:13,381
Oh my God, is he dying?
Where's my mom?

663
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,350
I don't know
what's happening.

664
00:44:16,352 --> 00:44:18,377
One, two, three.

665
00:44:18,421 --> 00:44:20,389
Oh, my God!

666
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:23,051
Still V-tach at 210.

667
00:44:23,092 --> 00:44:25,253
150 mg of amiodaraone.

668
00:44:25,294 --> 00:44:27,455
Grab the paddles.
Clear the room.

669
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:28,828
Cardiovert at 100.

670
00:44:28,865 --> 00:44:31,493
- Dad!
- Stand back.

671
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:33,365
- Daddy!
- All clear.

672
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:35,803
Clear.

673
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,073
- 200.
- Stand back.

674
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:42,168
- All clear.
- Clear.

675
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:34,786
Excuse me.

676
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:37,299
Is this
the Finnerty reunion?

677
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,563
Hello there.
They're waiting for you.

678
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:41,832
- Me?
- Of course.

679
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,306
Has Kevin Finnerty
arrived?

680
00:45:46,342 --> 00:45:47,673
We don't talk
like that here.

681
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,905
What do you mean?

682
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:51,937
Your family's inside.

683
00:45:54,617 --> 00:45:57,552
- What family?
- They're here to welcome you.

684
00:45:57,587 --> 00:45:59,714
I don't understand.

685
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:02,520
- You're going home.
- I am?

686
00:46:16,806 --> 00:46:19,468
Everyone's in there.

687
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:29,418
- You can't bring business in there.
- Daddy.

688
00:46:31,187 --> 00:46:35,419
I lost my real briefcase.

689
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,449
My whole life was in it.

690
00:46:37,493 --> 00:46:40,860
Don't go, Daddy.

691
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,528
- What is that?
- Briefcases aren't allowed.

692
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:50,630
- No, the voice.
- Please, let me take that from you.

693
00:46:52,508 --> 00:46:54,476
- Looks like it weighs a ton.
- I don't want to.

694
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,501
Well, you need to.
You need to let go.

695
00:46:56,546 --> 00:47:01,074
We love you, Daddy.
Don't leave us.

696
00:47:12,228 --> 00:47:14,924
For some reason...

697
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:16,829
I'm scared.

698
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:19,699
Well, there's nothing
to be scared of.

699
00:47:19,735 --> 00:47:21,760
You can let it go.

700
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,400
Just come say hello.

701
00:47:26,442 --> 00:47:28,740
All right.

702
00:47:33,082 --> 00:47:35,846
Daddy!

703
00:47:37,887 --> 00:47:40,651
Please don't leave us,
Daddy. We love you.

704
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:55,436
Dad?

705
00:47:55,471 --> 00:47:57,996
His eyes are open.

706
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,339
Daddy, look at
me right here.

707
00:48:01,377 --> 00:48:02,844
All right, normal
sinus rhythm.

708
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,847
- Pulse and pressure?
- Good.

709
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:08,339
Oh my God!
Thank God. Thank God.

710
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:10,011
Hang an amiodaraone drip

711
00:48:10,052 --> 00:48:12,612
and send off a set
of electrolytes now.

712
00:48:12,655 --> 00:48:15,453
Dad, look,
here you are.

713
00:48:19,662 --> 00:48:21,960
So I'm holding his hand,
and all of a sudden

714
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:23,966
the machines
go bullshit.

715
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,627
You told us,
for Christ's sake.

716
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:27,568
Those fucking doctors,
it's their fault.

717
00:48:27,603 --> 00:48:30,333
Skip's gonna make it.
He's conscious.

718
00:48:32,975 --> 00:48:35,637
Oh, thank God!

719
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,094
I got it, honey.

720
00:49:01,504 --> 00:49:03,062
Fuck took you so long?

721
00:49:03,105 --> 00:49:05,471
I had to get it
together, didn't I?

722
00:49:09,545 --> 00:49:11,809
We gotta get
that cut to her now.

723
00:49:11,847 --> 00:49:14,782
Easy, that's
a fucking guilty move.

724
00:49:14,817 --> 00:49:17,411
Tony's conscious.
You capisce?

725
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:19,819
Everybody and his
mother was in there talking to him

726
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:21,823
when he was in that coma.
Carmela.

727
00:49:21,857 --> 00:49:23,290
Who knows what
the fuck they said?

728
00:49:23,326 --> 00:49:26,989
Maybe he's expecting
that money.

729
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:28,997
Jesus Christ.

730
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:36,834
He can't talk yet because of the tube
that was in his throat.

731
00:49:36,872 --> 00:49:40,831
Maybe we should consider
ourselves lucky there.

732
00:49:43,145 --> 00:49:45,705
But we are very happy,
aren't we?

733
00:49:45,748 --> 00:49:50,117
Anthony, you had us
so worried.

734
00:49:50,152 --> 00:49:52,746
I haven't been to church that much
since I quit playing bingo.

735
00:49:53,889 --> 00:49:57,188
What, honey?

736
00:50:00,096 --> 00:50:02,826
I'm dead, right?

737
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:07,059
No, no, you're
in the hospital

738
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:08,832
with all of us.

739
00:50:08,871 --> 00:50:10,896
In Newark.

740
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,272
Mr. Soprano,
how are you today?

741
00:50:13,309 --> 00:50:15,709
I'm Dr. Vahapsideh.
I'm a neurologist.

742
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:23,576
How's he doing,
sweetheart?

743
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:25,917
I don't know if we're out of the woods
yet, but he's hanging in.

744
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:30,221
He just passed his
first simple mental acuity test, so...

745
00:50:30,259 --> 00:50:32,819
Your strength,
that was the difference.

746
00:50:35,097 --> 00:50:39,761
Oh, a little something
from us.

747
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:42,930
Help defray medical costs,
rehabilitation.

748
00:50:42,972 --> 00:50:46,066
Jesus, I don't know
what to say.

749
00:50:46,108 --> 00:50:48,076
This is what
we do, honey.

750
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,941
I'd want the same
for my Marie.

751
00:50:49,979 --> 00:50:52,948
Or my ma.

752
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:01,985
We're here
if you need anything.

753
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:21,474
Great fucking news, T.

754
00:51:24,513 --> 00:51:26,504
See you're up
and around.

755
00:51:29,785 --> 00:51:31,776
Best.

756
00:51:42,665 --> 00:51:45,759
"Sometimes I go about
in pity for myself,

757
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:47,792
and all the while,

758
00:51:47,837 --> 00:51:50,897
a great wind carries me
across the sky.

759
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,999
Ojibwe saying."

760
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:55,033
Indians, right?

761
00:51:57,313 --> 00:51:58,940
Who put this up?

762
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,747
Listen, T, something I wanted
to talk to you about.

763
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:15,987
I'm gonna take another run
at the movie business.

764
00:52:19,368 --> 00:52:21,928
I know you haven't
liked that in the past,

765
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:25,429
but I'm going about it
in a whole different way.

766
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:28,102
In fact, I'm hoping
you'll become an investor

767
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:30,112
when you feel
a little better,

768
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:32,876
and I can explain what we're doing.
It's pretty exciting.

769
00:52:32,915 --> 00:52:34,473
We'll own the neg.

770
00:52:34,517 --> 00:52:36,712
That's what they call it.
It means negative.

771
00:52:39,088 --> 00:52:42,319
I'm holding a large
ownership position

772
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:45,589
open for you.
I hope you approve.

773
00:52:48,597 --> 00:52:53,193
Actually, frankly...

774
00:52:53,235 --> 00:52:55,897
all due respect,

775
00:52:55,938 --> 00:52:58,532
I think you owe me this,

776
00:52:58,574 --> 00:53:00,872
as I came to you
about Adriana.

777
00:53:02,745 --> 00:53:04,474
You've got him up?

778
00:53:04,513 --> 00:53:08,347
I know how it looks, but he should
be upright as much as possible.

779
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:11,217
- I'm gonna leave you two alone.
- Thanks for everything.

780
00:53:11,253 --> 00:53:13,585
Okay.

781
00:53:19,495 --> 00:53:21,986
I don't know
how you do it.

782
00:53:38,714 --> 00:53:41,182
That's gotta feel
good, huh?

783
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:44,152
The simple things.
