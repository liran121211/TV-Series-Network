1
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:46,096
Nobody ever went broke underestimating
the taste of the American public.

2
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:09,550
The ancient Egyptians
postulated seven souls.

3
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:13,395
The top soul and the first to leave
at the moment of death

4
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:17,596
is Ren:
the Secret Name.

5
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:20,605
This corresponds
to my Director.

6
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,574
He directs
the film of your life

7
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:26,305
from conception
to death.

8
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:31,442
"The Secret Name"
is the title of your film.

9
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:36,113
When you die,
that's where Ren came in.

10
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:43,486
Second soul
and second one

11
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:46,794
off the sinking ship
is Sekem:

12
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:51,166
Energy, Power, Light.
The Director gives the orders,

13
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:54,229
Sekem presses
the right buttons.

14
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:09,110
Number three is Khu:
the Guardian Angel.

15
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:13,284
He, she or it
is third man out.

16
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:16,886
Number four is Ba:
the Heart...

17
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:19,022
often treacherous.

18
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,235
Number five is Ka:
the Double.

19
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:31,436
The Ka, which usually
reaches adolescence

20
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,467
at the time
of bodily death,

21
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:37,505
is the only reliable guide
through the Land of the Dead.

22
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:41,476
Who's gonna live here?

23
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,217
A family. I'll have it
finished by October.

24
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:52,286
- I'm worried, Ade.
- Everybody's worried.

25
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,893
No. I am worried
all the time.

26
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:10,310
Number six is Khaibit:
the Shadow, Memory,

27
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:15,184
your whole past conditioning from this and
other lives.

28
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:23,321
Number seven is Sekhu:
the Remains.

29
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:30,300
I'm halfway to China.
There's nothing here.

30
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,394
40,000 I had

31
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,099
my share of the Bohack's haul
from the '70s.

32
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,732
Did you wrap it right?

33
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:38,834
It gets moldy,
it could've disintegrated.

34
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:40,504
- Wrap what?
- The money.

35
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:45,439
He knows I need that money
for my fucking retrial!

36
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:47,042
- Who?
- You know who.

37
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:49,485
No, I don't know who.
That's why I asked you. 

38
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:52,615
- Malanga.
- Will you stop with that?

39
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:55,218
Pussy Malanga's dead
six years now.

40
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,353
I should dig him up
already!

41
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,895
Moles. They chewing
through your sprinklers too?

42
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:08,506
40,000 I had

43
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,872
my share of the Bohack's haul
from the '70s.

44
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:14,675
We'll look later.
You're gonna be late for your doctor's.

45
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:16,408
Come on.

46
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,122
Hello?

47
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,992
Let me ask you something:

48
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,758
Is your time more valuable
than mine?

49
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:34,561
Where is the baby?

50
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:37,432
Sorry, Ton'. The car seat,
the other stuff...

51
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:39,437
packin' it in there
takes forever.

52
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,439
You probably
remember that.

53
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:43,304
No, I don't.
I didn't do that crap.

54
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,276
How are you feeling,
Uncle Jun', huh?

55
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,937
He's late enough, Janice.
Come on.

56
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:48,445
A hello to your niece,
maybe?

57
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,812
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?

58
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,817
Help him get ready,
will you?

59
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,285
- Yeah.
- Come on, Jun'.

60
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,886
So? How's he doing?

61
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:05,089
He's Knucklehead Smith,
that's how he's doing.

62
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,564
He's fucking paranoid. He doesn't remember
whether he ate or not.

63
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,624
The man is not
competent, Tony.

64
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:12,398
- Not again Janice, come on!
- And he has the money for assisted living.

65
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:14,302
He's got legal bills
up the ass.

66
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,398
He can sell this museum
and move to Green Grove.

67
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:19,308
Fuck assisted living, okay?
Remember what they did to Ma?

68
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:23,144
- She was thriving there, Tony.
- He stays where he is, Janice.

69
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,149
He's our uncle.
It's the least we can do.

70
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:27,208
So the split,
your friend in Jersey

71
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,551
says it should be the same
as the old business we do over there.

72
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:32,352
That's public works,
this isn't.

73
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,258
- I'll hold the line.
- Don't turn it into World War III.

74
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,796
So day to day,
how are you getting along with Tony?

75
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:42,356
You asked me
to bury the hatchet, John.

76
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,835
I'm doing it
out of respect to you.

77
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,270
Am I still grieving
over my brother Bill?

78
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:49,239
It'll never go away.

79
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:51,367
I appreciate it, Phil.

80
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:55,473
- With me in here...
- I hear you, John.

81
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:05,152
Your bride,
she's a rock for you, kid.

82
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:09,117
Her brother's fitting me
for contacts.

83
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:10,958
When the trial starts,
I don't wanna be

84
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:13,294
reading documents
in the courtroom with glasses.

85
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:15,128
It looks weak.

86
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,896
Yes?

87
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,068
- Hey, Ton'.
- Hey.

88
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,373
My sports book
down in Roseville,

89
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,640
Bacala's still making
things unpleasant.

90
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,909
- God damn it.
- Listen, Tony,

91
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:31,848
I got you something.

92
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:35,148
For you, Carm, the kids,
David Yurman watches.

93
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:39,421
18-karat gold,
diamond center.

94
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,858
Why do I get the feelin'
there's a jeweler somewhere

95
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:43,884
filin' an insurance
claim today?

96
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:47,365
Actually,
that ain't what it is.

97
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,367
- My Aunt Edie died.
- No?

98
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:52,461
That one that moved to California
back in the '60s?

99
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:54,802
She was a great lady,
the only person in my life

100
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,398
who ever made me
feel special.

101
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,341
What are you gonna do?

102
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:02,005
Anyway, the silver cloud
is she did pretty well.

103
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,016
She was married
to Victor Borge's agent.

104
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,417
She left me an inheritance, Ton'.
Just over two mil.

105
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:13,887
Yeah.

106
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,086
Well, congratulations.

107
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,322
Make sure you invest it.

108
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:21,389
Well, you know, that's kinda
what I wanted to talk to you about.

109
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,325
Deanne and me
and the kids,

110
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,303
you know how much
we love Florida, right?

111
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,898
What, do you wanna put some money
on the street down there?

112
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,569
I was thinking about buying
a place in Fort Myers.

113
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,976
- Retiring there, actually.
- Retiring?

114
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:38,482
What, are you
a hockey player?

115
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:41,953
I'm gonna be 50 in three years, Ton'.
My dad died at 52.

116
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:44,956
You took an oath, Gene.
There's no retirin' from this.

117
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,721
Well, I thought about that,
and there was Joe Bananas.

118
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,751
Come on, huh?

119
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:55,329
What about your sports book,
your other responsibilities?

120
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,925
What am I supposed
to do about those?

121
00:08:56,968 --> 00:09:00,062
Benny? We know
Bobby wants it.

122
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:03,040
It's just, we go back
a long way, Ton'.

123
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:08,673
Yeah, we do.

124
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:12,672
Fuckin' CYO Basketball,
do you believe that?

125
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:14,617
It'd mean a lot
to me and Deanne.

126
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,225
Well, let me
think about it.

127
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:30,326
Ooh, look at this one
with the pool.

128
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:32,427
Yeah, we could
go swimming.

129
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,802
Guess who's blocking
the driveway again.

130
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,534
Did you talk
to Tony?

131
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:38,099
It looks good.
He gave me a hug.

132
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:40,543
- Did he like the watches?
- Do I know my psychology?

133
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,809
The realtor called.
She's e-mailing some pictures.

134
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:46,146
- The one on River Road?
- The split level, the four-bedroom.

135
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:48,709
They lost the buyer?

136
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:52,211
Hey, there he is.
Where are you goin'?

137
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:55,055
- Kevin's.
- Who else is gonna be there?

138
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:57,220
- Gene.
- I don't know.

139
00:09:57,262 --> 00:10:00,459
What's with this hostility all the time?
You want a smack in the mouth?

140
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:02,261
I told you I'm not
getting high anymore!

141
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,995
- I believe you.
- Stop fucking touching me.

142
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:05,866
Watch your mouth
in front of your sister!

143
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:07,872
I have a right to know
who your friends are!

144
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,498
Hey!

145
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,373
Hey!

146
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:30,386
Spicy shrimp hand roll,
that's Nori's favorite,

147
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:33,295
special yellowtail,
toro scallion and oysters.

148
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:35,299
You tell me
when you wanna stop.

149
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,301
Well, keep it comin'.

150
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:40,395
I don't know about you,
but ever since we found this place,

151
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:42,736
I catch myself
fantasizing about this.

152
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:45,572
Me too.
Sometimes during sex.

153
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,441
So I had a nightmare the other night.
Did I wake you up?

154
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:53,280
- No.
- Ade was in the house,

155
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:55,479
my spec house.

156
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,385
Was she gonna buy it?

157
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:59,481
We were just talking.

158
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:01,515
Speaking of which,
did you call that guy,

159
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,823
the inspector
at the building department?

160
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:06,228
- I will. I promise.
- He's coming on Friday, Tony.

161
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:07,959
That could be
my last chance to get

162
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,728
a reversal
on the stop-work order.

163
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:12,259
All right, I'll call.

164
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,771
I wonder where she is.

165
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:17,297
- Ade.
- I told you, she probably met some guy.

166
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,242
And not call anyone
for over a year?

167
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,837
What's this,
this sauce on the shrimp?

168
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,474
Shiromi, tekka maki,
salmon with tomato.

169
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,747
So I was over
by Ginny's,

170
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:29,754
that situation is
not going so well.

171
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:31,779
Johnny cooped up
and awaiting trial,

172
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:33,882
plus now they're fighting
an asset seizure.

173
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:36,792
They could lose everything,
the house, the condo at the shore.

174
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:41,194
You know Jimmy Petrille,
the rat that gave up John?

175
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:44,668
He's like an uncle to him,
his father's compare.

176
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,729
Why do you think I toss at night?
Ain't just the apnea.

177
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:50,570
I noticed you haven't been taking
your antidepressants.

178
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:52,940
And yet, the bonefish
are back in season.

179
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:55,673
We should count our blessings,
the kind of year I just had.

180
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,909
Oh no you're right.
We're very lucky.

181
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:02,181
$40 for a piece of fish
they just flew in first class.

182
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,950
I think we're
more than lucky.

183
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:09,624
Great food in there.
It's pretty good.

184
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:11,390
You wanna keep
this baggie or shall I?

185
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:13,090
- Nah, you keep it for lunch.
- Okay.

186
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:14,655
We're here.

187
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,360
Thanks for dinner, Hesh.

188
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:18,460
Grease is coming through
the bag as usual.

189
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:20,835
Chinese food,
it's part of the tradition.

190
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,800
What the...

192
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:28,676
What the fuck
is this?

193
00:12:30,882 --> 00:12:32,782
Come on, come on!
Hey, where are you goin'?

194
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:34,307
Get outta the car!

195
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:35,842
Get outta here,
get outta here!

196
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:38,822
- Take a hike, Jimmy.
- Open up, Eli!

197
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:40,347
- Get out!
- Open the fucking door!

198
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:42,416
- Get outta here!
- What do you want me to do?

199
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,361
- I can't do anything!
- Fucking Jew!

200
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:47,660
- Let's go, old man!
- Open the fucking door!

201
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:50,031
Holy shit, they're trying
to burn us out!

202
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:52,161
- Open the fucking door!
- Get out, Hesh!

203
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:57,538
- Leave me alone!
- Jerry warned you, Eli!

204
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:04,711
Jerry fucking told you
to stay outta Brooklyn!

205
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:07,240
What are you guys doin'?
You're gonna kill this guy.

206
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,388
Fuck you, Grandpa!

207
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:19,825
I tell you, one of the best things
about dropping the weight,

208
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,991
a whole new wardrobe.
I keep this up,

209
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,898
I'm gonna need
Clothing Anonymous.

210
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:27,701
You should have called your sponsor
before you bought that jacket.

211
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:30,537
Look at this guy.

212
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:33,043
"Members Only"?
How long have you been wearing that?

213
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:35,102
Cugino mio!

214
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:38,142
You look sharp.
How do you feel?

215
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:39,707
Two miles I walk
every mornin'.

216
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:41,616
You goin' to little
Tommy's communion?

217
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,985
I gotta talk to Aunt Lenore.
Say hello to Marie for me.

218
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:45,887
Hold on, hold on, let me
get that number,

219
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,585
- The guy who makes the custom cufflinks.
- Oh yeah.

220
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,354
What'd that prick want?

221
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,828
Really something, isn't he,
with that jerk-off face?

222
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:54,764
The eyebrows...
I fucking can't stand him.

223
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,098
I gotta tell you though,
he surprised me.

224
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:00,569
He's acting boss,

225
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,163
takes care
of John's business,

226
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,539
plus the wife
while John's in jail.

227
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:06,806
No complaints.

228
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,642
He's real old school.

229
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,511
Gotta take
my hat off.

230
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:12,277
Cocksucker
wanted me killed?

231
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,911
What's past is past.
Leave it alone.

232
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:16,750
Things are
going good now.

233
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:20,484
You and Phil settle
that office park shit?

234
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,993
We said
we'd revisit it.

235
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:25,018
Agent Harris,
where've you been?

236
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:28,430
I got some new federale
in my rear view for six months.

237
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:31,435
- Actually, I've been in Pakistan.
- Get the fuck out.

238
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:33,460
Seriously.
I was transferred to terrorism.

239
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:35,802
This is my partner, Ron Goddard.
Tony Soprano.

240
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,808
The terrorist
squad, huh?

241
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:40,436
What, did you lose a little weight?

242
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:42,309
You look good.
Atkins, right?

243
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:45,248
I caught a parasite over there.
Doctors don't know what it is.

244
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:47,649
- What do they eat, tabbouleh?
- Actually, that's why I'm here.

245
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:50,916
I've been dying for a Satriale's
veal parm hero.

246
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:57,962
Fuck him. I hope that parasite
eats his asshole out.

247
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:00,760
I kinda feel bad
for the guy.

248
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:03,130
Shit, when did
this happen?

249
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,898
Hold on.
Ton' just come in.

250
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:08,929
It's Hesh.

251
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:10,565
Yeah.

252
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,848
Here, honey.
It's ice.

253
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:23,245
Tony.

254
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,381
Thank you.

255
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:28,120
Hey.

256
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:32,622
Beth, how're you doin'?

257
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:34,632
I've had
better weeks.

258
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,634
Could you get me
some coffee, sweetie?

259
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:40,798
- Anyone else?
- Hot water with lemon would be great.

260
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:48,109
My son-in-law and me,
we're having dinner Sunday,

261
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:51,343
Chinese restaurant near Mill Basin,
we get jumped by three guys in a Lexus.

262
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:54,180
- Chinks did this?
- Are you trying to be fucking funny?

263
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:56,516
- You want a smack in the mouth?
- What? I was serious.

264
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:58,283
They're with your cousin
Phil Leotardo.

265
00:15:58,323 --> 00:15:59,756
I told you he was a prick!

266
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,554
- We were just with him.
- Let him talk.

267
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:03,560
I got some money
on the street over there.

268
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:06,358
Apparently, it got back
to Phil's guy

269
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:08,297
- Gerry Torciano.
- The Hairdo?

270
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,767
He claims that he felt
that Eli here was

271
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:13,794
some independent shy
trying to poach his customers.

272
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:16,568
- Is that a fucking catheter?
- Massive internal bleeding,

273
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:19,007
half his fucking skin
is sheared off his hips.

274
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:20,943
My daughter's
besides herself.

275
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:23,277
You send somebody to Brooklyn, and you
talk to Phil

276
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:26,249
- about this mook, this...
- Gerry Torciano.

277
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:32,084
Sorry I yelled
at you, kid.

278
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:49,569
I'm installing gable joists
in the rotunda.

279
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,736
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to agree
with the original assessment.

280
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,872
Oh, for the love
of Mike!

281
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:58,848
This is pine, sir,
utility grade.

282
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:01,943
I know what it is.
I've been building houses for years.

283
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:04,614
Then you know that the code calls
for Doug fir grade,

284
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:08,318
stamped for all floor joists,
ceiling joists, lintels and rafters.

285
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,055
Get Pudgie Walsh on the horn.
He'll straighten this out.

286
00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:13,893
Pudgie Walsh
retired, sir.

287
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:17,059
- I'm affirming the stop-work order.
- Oh, come on!

288
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:19,069
- For God's sake!
- Is there nothing else we can do about this?

289
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,833
You can schedule a further appeal.
But if I were you,

290
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:24,967
I'd think about starting over
with the proper lumber.

291
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,145
God, 15 times
I asked you!

292
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:34,151
Do you know what this does
to my cost basis,

293
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:36,813
- to start over with this?
- It's bureaucratic bullshit!

294
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:39,846
- In my day, they'd turn a blind eye.
- I hired you to do a job!

295
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:41,859
Hired?
I'm not for hire.

296
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:43,861
You presented this
like we were partners.

297
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,920
You don't listen to anybody, do you?

298
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:49,421
To hell with this.
No good deed goes unpunished.

299
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:55,571
Artie.

300
00:17:55,606 --> 00:17:57,836
Menus.

301
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,343
- Is that Phil?
- My wife.

302
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:09,046
What's it take to get that guy
to return a phone call?

303
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:10,850
I want this Hesh thing
settled.

304
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:13,379
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

305
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:16,621
Jesus Christ, Artie,
I can recite that menu in my sleep.

306
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,459
Where did he get this bread,
the bread museum?

307
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,400
The antipaste?

308
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:27,427
Fuckin' Phil.
Now I gotta go see the optometrist

309
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,963
to get a message to John
about this.

310
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:31,497
Go through
Ginny's brother?

311
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,635
He's a stunad
of the first magnitude.

312
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:36,647
I need a back channel
to John, obviously.

313
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,413
What the fuck is it?

314
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:43,420
I can't catch
a fucking break!

315
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:45,422
This is Tony Soprano

316
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:47,856
talking about
the Angelo Giacolone murder.

317
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:49,860
The sound quality
is not good,

318
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:52,158
but I can back it up
in court.

319
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:54,164
He said...

320
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:16,720
You all right, Ton'?

321
00:19:16,754 --> 00:19:19,552
Yeah.
That formaldehyde smell...

322
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,888
I knew this guy once,
Vietnam vet.

323
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:24,258
He drank formaldehyde
over there just to get high.

324
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:26,160
It's the alcohol.

325
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:29,764
Does he have to be here,
your fucking AA sponsor?

326
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,667
It ain't just that he helps me
with the disease, T.

327
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,728
This guy is great
at forging documents.

328
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:37,240
- He was a good kid, Raymond.
- The best.

329
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:40,767
At least he went fast.
Not like Dick Barone, poor fuck.

330
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:43,211
- Dick Barone died?
- Lou Gehrig's disease.

331
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:45,272
Did you ever think
what a coincidence it is

332
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:49,047
that Lou Gehrig died
of Lou Gehrig's disease?

333
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:51,577
You gonna make that same stupid joke
every time that comes up?

334
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:53,590
Sorry.

335
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:55,455
Everything's
so fucking morbid.

336
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:58,018
There's a man
lying dead over there.

337
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:00,053
I'm gonna go smoke.

338
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:12,505
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.

339
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:14,511
I don't know
what I was thinking.

340
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:16,445
For you.
Your taste.

341
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,107
The inheritance.

342
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,118
I didn't want
to say nothing,

343
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:23,848
with your aunt and all,
but this is thoughtful.

344
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:26,618
- So that thing we spoke about...
- Still mulling it.

345
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:28,921
Yeah, whatever.
Sure.

346
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,793
All right.
All right.

347
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:35,026
Look at this guy.
Not a day over 76.

348
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:37,296
- Fucking ballbreaker.
- How are you, Rusty?

349
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:41,496
Is Phil Leotardo here?
'Cause I won't stay

350
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:43,871
- in the same room with that man.
- I haven't seen him.

351
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:46,206
So you hear about that guy
in Westchester?

352
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,007
Fucking captain,

353
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:50,445
doing his own radio broadcast
the last three years.

354
00:20:50,481 --> 00:20:53,348
- W.R.A.T.
- Jesus Christ, another one now?

355
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:57,286
No wonder the papers are calling this
"The Year of the Rat."

356
00:20:57,321 --> 00:21:00,813
Standup guys like that,
they're a dying breed.

357
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:02,951
Amen to that.

358
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,962
What can you do?

359
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:07,965
Anyway, let me go
pay my respects.

360
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,990
All right, Rusty.

361
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:23,973
- You okay?
- I gotta get out of here.

362
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:26,950
He's thinking about it.
What do you want me to tell you?

363
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:30,317
How many years have we dreamt
about this, to get out of this shit?

364
00:21:30,354 --> 00:21:32,345
Every time someone
we know gets arrested...

365
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,823
I know. Will you stop?

366
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:36,986
I'm worried, Gene.
We've already made the offer.

367
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:39,258
I'm doing
everything I can.

368
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:42,494
Why are you fighting?

369
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,797
We're not fighting, sweetie.
We're talking.

370
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:47,360
- How come you're not in bed, hmm?
- I don't know.

371
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:50,340
All I'm saying is,
he has to see

372
00:21:50,374 --> 00:21:52,365
this is a huge
opportunity for us.

373
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,378
Give the man
time to process.

374
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:59,306
Oh my God,
this eel is delicious.

375
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,818
Okay, Spanish mackerel now.

376
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:03,513
Can I get
another sake, hon'?

377
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:10,516
Listen, I got some stuff
I gotta take care of.

378
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:13,121
You okay
to drive yourself home?

379
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:15,758
I don't have
my car, Tony.

380
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,200
Oh, yeah.
So take this one.

381
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:20,465
- Hey, Mrs. S.
- What is this?

382
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:22,472
Oh my God.

383
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:24,474
Is this the new Porsche?

384
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,037
Cayenne Turbo.
I got the 4.5 liter V-8.

385
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:32,208
Wasn't sure about the color,
so I took a shot.

386
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,683
Tony, I love it.
It's gorgeous!

387
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:37,779
I still wish you'd talked to that guy
at the building department,

388
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:40,154
but oh my God!
What a car!

389
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,836
Ho, Joe College,
where's your mother?

390
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:02,368
She went to the outlet stores
with Aunt Ro.

391
00:23:02,413 --> 00:23:04,608
Is that the jacket
we got you for Christmas?

392
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:07,640
I'm lending it to Matt.

393
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:12,647
Hey, how was the interview
for the internship?

394
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,282
Got moved
to next week.

395
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:16,190
Would you mind keeping me
in the loop, though, since it was

396
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:18,957
- my lawyer that set it up?
- Okay.

397
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,669
- Matt don't have his own clothes?
- He's borrowing it for a party.

398
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:28,365
Oh, good.
You'll never see it again.

399
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,772
You have such a low
opinion of people.

400
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,678
Let me tell you
something, AJ.

401
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:37,681
I don't care
how close you are,

402
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,910
in the end, your friends
are gonna let you down.

403
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,510
Family. They're the only ones
you can depend on.

404
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:53,322
He was vital, my uncle,
alive.

405
00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:56,333
For all his faults,
he was sharp in his day.

406
00:23:58,235 --> 00:24:00,795
But now...

407
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,699
We stopped
at a light yesterday,

408
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:09,178
and I see this nanny,

409
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:11,579
black girl,
pushing a baby carriage.

410
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:13,583
Coming the other way,

411
00:24:13,617 --> 00:24:15,778
there's another one

412
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,050
with this old lady
in a wheelchair

413
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:21,990
- staring off into space.
- The circle of life.

414
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:26,019
The circle jerk of life.
Where's the dignity?

415
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:30,090
If you're lucky, in the end you can
let go of your pride,

416
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:32,159
let your loved ones
care for you.

417
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:34,330
I'd rather they hold
a pillow over my face.

418
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:36,771
I find it interesting
you would say that.

419
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:40,938
You tried to smother
your mother with a pillow.

420
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,677
- What?
- In the hospital, after her stroke.

421
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:48,014
The fuck I did!

422
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:50,782
I grabbed a pillow,
but it was...

423
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:54,257
just to keep my hands
occupied.

424
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,259
Have you considered

425
00:24:56,293 --> 00:24:58,727
getting your uncle
some live-in help?

426
00:24:58,762 --> 00:25:02,061
We got a girl comes in days,
she's from Trinidad.

427
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:04,431
Does he have the means
for assisted living?

428
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:07,869
Did you just say to let your loved ones
take care of you?

429
00:25:07,905 --> 00:25:10,669
- If it's feasible.
- Well, he's my uncle.

430
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:12,539
I don't think that's what
we're talking about.

431
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:13,907
What are we
talking about?

432
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:17,402
The fact that you still,
after all this time,

433
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:20,042
cannot accept you had a mother
who didn't love you.

434
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:22,450
In pitying your uncle,

435
00:25:22,486 --> 00:25:24,920
the man she conspired with,

436
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:27,617
you're turning the blame
for what she did

437
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:31,719
back on yourself again,
after all this time.

438
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:33,730
What was your mother like?

439
00:25:33,764 --> 00:25:36,232
Did she ever let you down,
hurt your feelings?

440
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:38,633
Of course she did.
She was controlling

441
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:40,967
and manipulative at times.

442
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:44,634
- She also never tried to kill me.
- I pushed her over the edge.

443
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:48,111
By placing her in a lovely
retirement community.

444
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:49,669
It's a nursing home!

445
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:52,204
It's less hurtful to believe
that they were right

446
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:55,241
to try and destroy you
than to accept the fact

447
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:58,414
that she didn't value you.

448
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:07,127
Hesh is a personal
friend of mine,

449
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:09,223
and the kid is
his son-in-law.

450
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:12,099
Now I know Phil's got
a lot on his plate, but come on.

451
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:15,003
I'll talk to John. I was taking
my sister there Saturday anyway.

452
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,405
How is Ginny?
Carmela says she's got her hands full.

453
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:20,103
The kid has the weight
of the world on her.

454
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:25,578
Ray-Bans.
Classic, affordable.

455
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:27,140
I just put those
on special.

456
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:31,018
You got something
a little more current?

457
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,481
Like those.

458
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:42,726
Armanis.
Flexible acetate frames,

459
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:45,496
rimless lenses.

460
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:51,400
You know what?
I left my wallet in the car.

461
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:53,433
I'll catch you next time.

462
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:06,580
Some people
from the IRS came by.

463
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,922
They want to inventory
the entire house.

464
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:13,863
Maybe I should
sell the car,

465
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:15,865
at least get some
liquidity out of it.

466
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:17,696
The Maserati?

467
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:20,329
Can't say I disagree.

468
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:22,396
That breaks my
fucking heart.

469
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:26,068
Christopher Moltisanti
came over to the house asking about it.

470
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,238
He'll pay cash, he said.

471
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,077
There's something else,
John,

472
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:34,676
Phil related.

473
00:27:34,718 --> 00:27:37,016
The Hairdo, he's in a beef
with the Jew.

474
00:27:37,054 --> 00:27:39,682
What?
God damn it, what?

475
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:41,691
The Jew's son-in-law.
It got physical.

476
00:27:41,725 --> 00:27:45,183
Anyway your friend from Jersey got involved,
but he can't get Phil to focus.

477
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:47,527
Do I not have enough
on my fucking mind?

478
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:49,532
The guy from Jersey
asked me to tell you.

479
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:53,229
Well, then call Phil
and have him fucking handle it!

480
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,366
Don't yell at my brother, John.
He's trying to do right by us.

481
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,411
The pictures
from Allegra's shower.

482
00:28:29,106 --> 00:28:31,074
Noon he said, right?

483
00:28:31,108 --> 00:28:33,076
Passive-aggressive
bullshit.

484
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,102
I recognize that in people
every time now.

485
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:38,114
There he is.

486
00:28:38,148 --> 00:28:41,117
Ho, finally. I was starting to grow
mushrooms out my ass.

487
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:43,051
There's an image.

488
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,357
So Gerry filled me in
on the way over.

489
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:54,159
This whole thing was
a complete misunderstanding.

490
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:56,496
Yeah, this Eli kid, I had any idea
he was with you,

491
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:59,001
- I would have never.
- He didn't tell you about Hesh?

492
00:28:59,036 --> 00:29:02,563
I asked who he was. He high-handed me.
I thought he was a civilian.

493
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:04,369
Still, to get dragged
by a car?

494
00:29:04,408 --> 00:29:07,844
For the record, though,
the car thing was a hit-and-run.

495
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:10,844
So what do we do here?

496
00:29:10,881 --> 00:29:12,974
- What did we say?
- 25 sounds right.

497
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:16,110
He's bleeding internally.
Pain, suffering...

498
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:18,815
So you tell me. 50?

499
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:20,824
Yeah, fair enough.

500
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:22,917
Could we segue now
into something more pressing?

501
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,928
The floor is yours,
Senator.

502
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:28,363
I spoke to John. The split on the office
park is way out of whack.

503
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:30,263
Same thing
as the Esplanade.

504
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,791
Apples and bowling balls, Tony.
With fuel costs now...

505
00:29:32,836 --> 00:29:35,464
Like you're not
passing that on to the drivers?

506
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:37,701
65-35.

507
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:45,338
All right.

508
00:29:48,886 --> 00:29:51,411
Why you always cave
for this prick?

509
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:54,447
I'm not caving.
It's a strategy.

510
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:57,627
Johnny's in jail.
You keep him happy,

511
00:29:57,661 --> 00:30:00,255
he'll keep a lid
on Phil.

512
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:04,324
Tony B,
Phil's kid brother,

513
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:06,802
the bad taste
that left with Phil...

514
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:09,863
there are 200 soldiers
in his family.

515
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:11,875
I'm not scared of them.

516
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:13,876
- Tony left?
- Yeah.

517
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:16,277
I stopped by Stewart's.
I got a whole lunch set up.

518
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:31,420
Did Tony mention anything to you
about what we talked about?

519
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:33,429
About you
moving to Florida?

520
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:36,057
Did he say if he's leaning
one way or the other?

521
00:30:40,003 --> 00:30:42,938
Listen, there's something
I need you to do.

522
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:45,339
I got a call from Fritzie
up in Boston.

523
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:48,742
There's a guy named
Teddy Spirodakis, owes some money.

524
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:52,875
- You want me to collect?
- That ship sailed. Final notice time.

525
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,543
Really?

526
00:30:54,585 --> 00:30:56,485
You got a problem
with that?

527
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,488
No.

528
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:01,082
I just gotta run it by Vito.
He's my captain.

529
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:03,615
Believe me,
Vito will be down with it.

530
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,719
So this comes from Tony?

531
00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:08,287
It's coming from me.
I'm not a fucking captain?

532
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:10,527
All right, okay?

533
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:13,603
- How soon?
- ASAP.

534
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:15,605
Like right away.

535
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:17,766
I'll call with the details.
Get it done.

536
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:20,709
I'll put in a good word to T
about the Florida thing.

537
00:31:40,964 --> 00:31:43,364
The rear deck, didn't they say
that would be refinished?

538
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,665
That's the old photo.
It's been completely redone.

539
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:49,035
And the wiring in the pool house?
Tell them they can knock

540
00:31:49,072 --> 00:31:51,472
two grand off the price
or they can sell to someone else.

541
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:53,669
Listen, you're responding
to their counter.

542
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,575
You should ask
for whatever you want.

543
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:57,580
Okay, we'll call you
tomorrow.

544
00:31:57,614 --> 00:31:59,582
All right then,
good night.

545
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:01,982
What do you think?

546
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:04,715
That if we lose this house,
I'm gonna die.

547
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:14,727
Ton', what do you want
to do for dinner?

548
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:16,756
I'll be right down!

549
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,599
Well...

550
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:54,270
Hey.

551
00:32:54,304 --> 00:32:56,704
Your new insurance card.

552
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,970
Oh, good.

553
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:04,676
Any thoughts
on dinner?

554
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:06,706
Whatever you like.

555
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:10,253
I know this is insane,

556
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:12,517
but I can't stop
thinking about Nori's.

557
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:13,921
I was just there.

558
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:16,687
- Today? With who?
- Nobody.

559
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:19,287
You went there
without me?

560
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:22,492
Yeah, I was hungry.

561
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:24,693
- What?
- Well, Nothing.

562
00:33:24,735 --> 00:33:26,703
- Come on, what?
- I don't know,

563
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:29,103
I just thought
that was our special place.

564
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:30,868
Well, it is.

565
00:33:30,907 --> 00:33:32,534
Well?

566
00:33:32,576 --> 00:33:34,942
- I went there alone, Carm.
- I know that. You said.

567
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:39,278
It just felt nice
to have something special, for us.

568
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:42,183
No kids around,
without my parents.

569
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:45,254
We can go
if you want.

570
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:47,483
No no,
don't be silly.

571
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:49,515
Are you sure?

572
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:59,225
How's the car?

573
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:23,826
Teddy, right?

574
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,795
Yeah.
Hey!

575
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,998
- Carmela.
- Ginny, hi.

576
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:08,368
I tried calling,
but I kept getting the machine.

577
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:10,498
Is everything all right?
Truth is,

578
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,100
sometimes I don't answer the phone.
Goddamn creditors.

579
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:16,340
I was in the neighborhood. I thought
I might kidnap you for a spa date.

580
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:18,279
Well, that's
a nice surprise.

581
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:21,182
I thought maybe we'd drive up there,
maybe stop at Occitane.

582
00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:23,186
Is that new?

583
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,188
Oh, the car?
Yes yes.

584
00:35:25,222 --> 00:35:26,985
Porsche Cayenne,
like the pepper.

585
00:35:27,023 --> 00:35:29,389
It's beautiful, Carm.

586
00:35:29,426 --> 00:35:31,951
Five minutes

587
00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:35,362
at no incline. Then I switch to full
uphill for my cardio.

588
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:37,832
I was telling Tony
he should come with me.

589
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:41,497
- Do him good.
- It ain't just aesthetics, either.

590
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:43,938
God forbid he ever has
a heart attack.

591
00:35:45,008 --> 00:35:46,942
Yeah.

592
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:49,502
Vito, you're in
the handicapped spot.

593
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:53,004
- That fucking guy is here again?
- The man's a former judge.

594
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:58,346
Hey, listen to this.

595
00:35:58,388 --> 00:36:01,357
"If your nose runs
and your feet smell...

596
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:03,086
you're built
upside down."

597
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:05,287
Funny.

598
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:09,962
Hey, by the way,
your Florida thing...

599
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:13,798
Tony asked me
to speak to you...

600
00:36:15,272 --> 00:36:16,864
that's a no-go.

601
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:18,932
- What?
- Can't be accommodated.

602
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:20,875
You're part of the team.

603
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:24,745
- But I just did that thing.
- That's not my department.

604
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:30,278
Well, can I talk
to Tony at least?

605
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,288
I wouldn't bother him.

606
00:36:32,322 --> 00:36:35,018
He's out on the new boat.

607
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:39,755
Does he think
I'm gonna talk about shit up here,

608
00:36:39,796 --> 00:36:42,458
with what I've done,
what I just did?

609
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,848
It's not so silly
when you think about it.

610
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:03,950
I'm a top earner now.

611
00:37:03,987 --> 00:37:05,955
It's not out of the realm
of possibility

612
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:08,890
that I could be the boss
of this family one day.

613
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,185
I mean, God forbid
Tony ever gets...

614
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,599
cancer, coronary,
something like that.

615
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:31,372
- Yeah.
- Hey, big brother.

616
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:34,349
Listen, I know I was supposed to sit
with Uncle Jun' tonight,

617
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:36,648
but Tom just called
from location.

618
00:37:36,686 --> 00:37:39,621
Apparently,
some smoke effect went awry

619
00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:41,624
and he inhaled
noxious chemicals.

620
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:43,023
Well, go go.

621
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:47,894
The thing is,
Uncle Jun' doesn't want me to.

622
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:51,025
He's exceptionally agitated
today and he's been nauseous.

623
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:55,696
Well, did you call Janice?
I mean, her or Bobby should go.

624
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:58,207
- I'm all the way out here on a boat.
- They can't do it.

625
00:37:58,241 --> 00:38:00,072
- What do you mean can't?
- I don't know.

626
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,840
She didn't elaborate.
It didn't seem like she wanted to.

627
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:05,905
- Aw, God damn it!
- I'm sorry, Tony.

628
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,917
All right, all right,
all right.

629
00:38:18,395 --> 00:38:21,262
Mother...

630
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:37,670
I swear to God, I'm throwing
all this shit right in the garbage!

631
00:38:37,714 --> 00:38:40,205
It's my hobby, Janice.
Why do you gotta belittle it?

632
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,912
Will you just
get ready please?

633
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:46,080
- You go. I gotta work.
- You can do your collections tomorrow!

634
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:49,717
I'm on a schedule!
It don't work that way.

635
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:51,727
This is why you can't
watch Uncle Jun'?

636
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:54,025
I told you last week,
we have Nica's preschool meeting.

637
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:56,396
- She's 15 months old.
- No one was more competitive

638
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:58,526
than your wife when
it came to this stuff with AJ.

639
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:00,536
A lot of good it did.

640
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,765
This child, constantly wanting
the breast.

641
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:05,775
He doesn't want to be alone.
He says he doesn't feel good.

642
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:09,506
The school, they need to meet both
parents if it's an intact family.

643
00:39:09,546 --> 00:39:11,411
So call the girl,
the nurse.

644
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:14,906
Miss Trinidad? Right. Every time
I call, a different person answers.

645
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:17,078
I'll go, Ton'.
I'm on it.

646
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,089
You know what Fuck it! 
You wanna get something done,
you gotta do it yourself.

647
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:22,853
You were the one
who was opposed to assisted living.

648
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,693
You and I
are gonna talk.

649
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,865
Well, you didn't have
to wear your fucking hat.

650
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:37,463
Shit.

651
00:39:37,507 --> 00:39:40,943
So how about you?
Are you dating?

652
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:42,638
With my hours
at the body shop?

653
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:45,842
Ladies.
Dessert was on me.

654
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:47,406
Thank you, Artie.

655
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,850
It's nice to see you two
patch things up.

656
00:39:49,886 --> 00:39:52,878
- So silly.
- I'm not even sure what happened.

657
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:54,890
Me and Tony didn't speak
for months.

658
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:56,619
You pick up
right where you left off.

659
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:59,594
Did Charmaine tell you?
We're getting back together.

660
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:01,756
No, she didn't
mention it.

661
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:04,733
- That's terrific!
- We're both very happy.

662
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:09,294
Jesus, will you
hear me out at least?

663
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:12,638
We buy here. Livingston,
North Caldwell maybe.

664
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:14,643
Right near Tony.

665
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:16,702
Better schools,
new friends.

666
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:19,374
We got the money, baby.
$2 million.

667
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,907
It's not
the same, Gene.

668
00:40:21,951 --> 00:40:24,181
It could be better.

669
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,950
The summers down there,
we were ignoring the negatives.

670
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,050
It's fucking brutal
with the bugs.

671
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:34,427
Tony and Silvio,
all they understand is appearances.

672
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:37,695
We'll buy a new car.
It'll raise my profile.

673
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:40,430
You watch,
I'll make captain.

674
00:40:52,582 --> 00:40:55,847
I found this
under our son's bed.

675
00:41:07,864 --> 00:41:11,527
Florida's any better?
It's the drug capital of the world.

676
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:13,468
Look, for Tony to...

677
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:15,528
Tony, Tony!
Why don't you kill him?

678
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:17,972
- Put a bullet in his fucking head.
- I can't do that.

679
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:21,238
What, you think I don't know
that you've done it before?

680
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:24,812
- He's the boss, Deanne.
- The boss of what?

681
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:27,408
He's a piece of shit!

682
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:30,812
Is our life that bad?

683
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:33,846
It's your money.
Your aunt's money.

684
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,859
It has nothing
to do with him.

685
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:41,623
There's this wonderful
Jersey contemporary

686
00:41:41,664 --> 00:41:45,327
I want you to see with me.
It's cathedral ceilings.

687
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:48,098
You'll fall in love.

688
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:52,202
There's nothing
I can say.

689
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:04,619
Colonel Dax, you're
a disappointment to me.

690
00:42:04,654 --> 00:42:07,748
You have spoiled
the keenness of your mind

691
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,758
by wallowing
in sentimentality.

692
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:12,124
You really did want
to save those men

693
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:14,425
and you were not angling
for Mireau's command.

694
00:42:14,464 --> 00:42:16,432
You're an idealist

695
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:18,491
and I pity you as I would
the village idiot.

696
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:21,163
We're fighting a war, Dax,
a war that we've got to win.

697
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:23,263
Those men didn't fight,
so they were shot.

698
00:42:23,306 --> 00:42:26,673
I apologize for not being
entirely honest with you.

699
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:29,007
I apologize for not revealing
my true feelings.

700
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:31,172
I apologize, sir,
for not telling you...

701
00:42:31,214 --> 00:42:33,307
- Hello.
- Who's that?

702
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:35,249
- It's me.
- You can go to hell

703
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:37,617
before I apologize to you
now or ever again!

704
00:42:37,654 --> 00:42:39,679
- What are you doing?
- I lost my uppers.

705
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:41,986
- Probably upstairs.
- God fuck it all!

706
00:42:42,025 --> 00:42:44,118
Relax, will ya?
We'll find them.

707
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,358
The phone keeps ringing,
and then they hang up.

708
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:50,491
It's probably salespeople.

709
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:53,832
- I know who it is!
- Pussy Malanga, I know.

710
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,964
We'll get J. Edgar Hoover
right on it.

711
00:42:57,006 --> 00:43:00,032
I'll tell you what, you go upstairs,
you look for your teeth.

712
00:43:00,076 --> 00:43:03,637
I'm gonna fix you
something to eat, okay?

713
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:08,543
I had a banana
in there.

714
00:43:10,453 --> 00:43:13,115
All right,
we'll find that too.

715
00:43:17,093 --> 00:43:19,721
I got it.

716
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:22,731
We buy a vacation place
in Florida, a condo.

717
00:43:22,765 --> 00:43:24,392
It's not the same.

718
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:26,402
I make another run
at Tony

719
00:43:26,436 --> 00:43:28,563
- six months, a year from now.
- A year?

720
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:31,073
- You can go ahead even.
- What?

721
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:33,769
And let me tell you,
a year, two years from now

722
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,539
everything could be
different.

723
00:43:35,578 --> 00:43:38,570
Tony could be gone.

724
00:43:42,652 --> 00:43:46,019
- I, uh...
- Go ahead.

725
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:48,114
His master's voice.

726
00:44:00,003 --> 00:44:01,994
Yeah?

727
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:06,137
Now?!

728
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:34,669
- Gene, this is Agent Sanseverino.
- Hello.

729
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:37,264
So where've you been, buddy?
Haven't heard from you lately.

730
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:40,742
Busy, you know.
My kid has some problems.

731
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:42,745
That's rough.

732
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:45,179
The thing is, Geno,
you gotta keep in touch with me.

733
00:44:45,214 --> 00:44:47,341
You're gonna have a chance to help
in more important ways.

734
00:44:47,383 --> 00:44:50,750
- What do you mean?
- We lost a major asset this month.

735
00:44:50,787 --> 00:44:53,347
- The point is...
- Was Ray Curto a cooperator?

736
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:56,756
The way things are shaping up,
you're a designated hitter.

737
00:44:56,793 --> 00:44:59,489
Look, Ron,

738
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:01,497
we've talked
about Florida, okay?

739
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:03,590
Gene, that's not
gonna happen.

740
00:45:03,633 --> 00:45:05,897
Here among your friends
is where you're useful.

741
00:45:05,935 --> 00:45:08,802
I told you, you tell your bosses,
I'd come back for any trial.

742
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:11,830
Florida's just one of those things
you gotta let go.

743
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:24,319
Okay.

744
00:45:24,353 --> 00:45:28,016
So, the Feast of St. Joe's,
Tony gave some rulings on the unions.

745
00:45:28,057 --> 00:45:30,855
Were any made guys
from New York there?

746
00:47:16,632 --> 00:47:18,600
10 minutes, Uncle Jun'.

747
00:47:18,634 --> 00:47:20,795
Who's down there?

748
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,101
Artie Shaw.
10 minutes.

749
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:25,107
Don't go anywhere.

750
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:27,109
I'm not.
I'm right here.

751
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:39,748
You got any wine?

752
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:41,950
Malanga!

753
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:05,636
Well, here I am.

754
00:49:05,675 --> 00:49:07,370
Is that a Porsche?

755
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,537
Had my eye on it for months.
It's a gift from Tony.

756
00:49:09,578 --> 00:49:11,910
I thought about a Boxster,
but I don't know.

757
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,848
The 'Vette felt
more like me.

758
00:49:15,384 --> 00:49:16,578
You bought that
yourself?

759
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:19,588
The accountant says I'm better off
owning it outright.

760
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,932
Uncle Jun'!

761
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,438
Call 911!

762
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:38,463
Uncle Jun'!

763
00:49:50,086 --> 00:49:52,077
Uncle Jun'!

764
00:50:24,086 --> 00:50:26,816
911, where is
the emergency?

765
00:50:26,856 --> 00:50:30,986
911, where is
the emergency?

766
00:51:33,022 --> 00:51:38,255
Number six is Khaibit:
the Shadow, Memory,

767
00:51:38,294 --> 00:51:43,129
your whole past conditioning from this and
other lives.

768
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:07,883
Number seven is Sekhu:
the Remains.
