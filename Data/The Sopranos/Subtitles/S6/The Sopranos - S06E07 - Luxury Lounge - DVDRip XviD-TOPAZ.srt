1
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:01,085
You guys speak English?

2
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,485
Not some too much.

3
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,703
I just wanna say

4
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:01,143
it's been a while
since we opened the books

5
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:03,943
and in regards
to you guys...

6
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:05,540
Burt, Gerry...

7
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,551
as a man
of few words, I...

8
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:09,780
Not few enough, though, huh?
New blood.

9
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:12,346
- New blood.
- Salut.

10
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,726
Sure, we break
some balls here tonight,

11
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,458
but I go way back.

12
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:22,489
And in light
of recent humiliations,

13
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:26,402
it's a honor
to be joined by men

14
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:29,373
and not faggot-ass
corn-holing cocksuckers

15
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,068
like married my cousin.

16
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:32,838
- He should fuckin' die!
- Phil, relax.

17
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:36,005
- Whoa whoa whoa, Phil.
- Take it easy.

18
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:38,242
Phil, you know the wine
makes you emotional.

19
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:40,080
'Cause I got
an empty fuckin' stomach.

20
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:44,020
- So have a breadstick.
- 45 minutes for some grilled eggplant?

21
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:46,523
Jesus Christ, is there nothing
without this complaining?

22
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:50,585
You didn't notice?
Artie's game is a little off lately.

23
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:52,960
Well, Carmela sent
her branzino back Sunday night,

24
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:54,931
but she loves
to do that.

25
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:56,593
Gentlemen,
how's everything so far?

26
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:58,397
- Fantastic.
- Delicious.

27
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:00,028
The delay,
a thousand pardons.

28
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:01,868
I'm breaking in
a new guy on the line.

29
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:03,373
You seem set
for antipasto.

30
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:06,434
I gotta be honest, new guy
in the kitchen aside,

31
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:08,742
I mean, how come we're waiting?
It seems empty out there.

32
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,180
People like to get in
that last barbecue.

33
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:14,811
Artie, you been
to this "Da Giovanni" up by Troy Hills?

34
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:17,253
- No, I haven't been.
- Supposed to be incredible.

35
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:19,188
- He's a kid, right?
- I hate fish,

36
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:21,283
but his,
with the agrodolce...

37
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:23,658
I'll check it out.

38
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:26,425
- Ah, buon appetito.
- About time.

39
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:38,172
Fuckin' Phil.
Some display, huh?

40
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:40,905
Paid a visit
to Vito's goomar, Jill.

41
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:42,913
She still hasn't
heard from Vito.

42
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:48,410
We were just discussin'
"La Cage aux Fat."

43
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:50,921
I was gonna get my cousin Tommy
to call his detective friend.

44
00:04:50,955 --> 00:04:54,254
I've been hamstrung with that work
stoppage at the office park.

45
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:57,784
Vito shows up, he shows up,
then we deal with him. If not...

46
00:04:57,829 --> 00:04:59,922
It's just a phone call.
And seriously,

47
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:03,559
Tommy says the guy can track somebody
from the corn in his shit.

48
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:05,626
Yeah, I saw them
do that on "CSI."

49
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,608
- Good night.
- Bye, Sack.

50
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:12,735
- Bye now.
- Good night, kid.

51
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:15,268
Hey, I was glad to hear you say
that about the search,

52
00:05:15,313 --> 00:05:19,044
'cause I gotta take a little time off
for some business in Cali.

53
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,348
Little Carmine's
lined up a meet in L.A. for us.

54
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:24,787
So, what is it,
business or time off?

55
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:27,121
Time off from here,
but definite business.

56
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:28,989
With Ben Kingsley, Ton'.

57
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,585
So you're gonna go
get an autograph

58
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:33,119
on the weekend
of the Notre Dame-Michigan game?

59
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:35,462
I got my guys all over it.
Little Carmine says

60
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,900
if we attach Ben Kingsley,
the picture's a go.

61
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:39,665
Little Carmine?

62
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:41,968
It's common knowledge
the guy's retarded.

63
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:44,270
I don't get it.
You agreed to this in the hospital.

64
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,539
Christopher,
I was in a coma.

65
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:51,377
Okay, fine.
I'll call Little Carmine,

66
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,647
call the airline, cancel.

67
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:58,514
I'll probably
still reach someone.

68
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:01,421
What am I gonna do
with you?

69
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,825
Make a lot of money.

70
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:07,758
All right.

71
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:17,336
What the fuck
is this idiot doing?

72
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:20,734
No speak English.

73
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:22,678
...Brooklyn.

74
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:24,773
Ho, pal.
Move your car. We're late.

75
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:31,121
Move el automobile.

76
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:38,255
Rusty! Don't forget
to call Marissa.

77
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:42,861
Hurry up. Let me see.

78
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:49,503
- Museum...
- Eastern Parkway.

79
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,065
Eastern Parkway,
not the Belt Parkway.

80
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:14,592
So I'm trying to eject the DVD
and the kids are freaking,

81
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:16,623
"What's wrong
with that lady, Daddy?"

82
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:19,068
- And Carrie says...
- How's the scaloppine?

83
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:21,298
Uh, it's delicious.
Thanks.

84
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:23,967
It all depends on slicing
the veal very thin.

85
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,976
My way...

86
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,240
I like to chill it down
a degree or two

87
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,645
and then I pull a straight razor
right across it.

88
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,546
Your father could cook.

89
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:36,485
He told me when you were in here last.
75th birthday, right?

90
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:39,649
- In the navy.
- What's that?

91
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:41,158
In the navy,
he cooked.

92
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,387
Terrific guy.
Great head of hair.

93
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:44,895
You enjoy.

94
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:48,456
Save room. I'll be back
with dessert specials.

95
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:52,036
Ho, Benny,
Moe and Jack.

96
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,901
How's the bruschett'?

97
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:55,701
You got a quorum.
Let me get you a table.

98
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,538
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna stay right here.

99
00:07:58,576 --> 00:08:01,511
My best customer,
but he's nailed to this fuckin' spot.

100
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:04,572
It's either the wine
or the view.

101
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:06,173
Such a sweet kid.

102
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:08,344
You know, she told Charmaine
that back in Albania

103
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:09,910
her whole family
got blown up

104
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:13,253
waiting on line
for an oil change.

105
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,350
The shit she's been through,
we just had to help.

106
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:17,554
I even called in a favor with my cousin
in Manhattan,

107
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:20,189
got her a working visa,
started on the green card.

108
00:08:20,231 --> 00:08:22,563
Martina,
come do some hosting.

109
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:26,294
- Hi.
- Hi.

110
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:27,395
What's up?

111
00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:29,269
This is your cheering
section over here.

112
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:32,105
- Hello, Benny.
- You got the reservations squared away?

113
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:33,974
It's very few
right now.

114
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:36,708
Football season.

115
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:40,116
I could watch her
walk away all night.

116
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:43,314
Good, 'cause like most girls with you,
that's what she's gonna do.

117
00:08:43,354 --> 00:08:45,447
Ah, to be young
and single again like these two,

118
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,980
huh, Benito?

119
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:19,283
I can put the credit card numbers on
actual plastic

120
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:21,848
for an extra five bills.

121
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:25,724
We do Internet strictly.

122
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:43,904
The gnocchi!

123
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,448
I'll take your word.
It's a little too rich for my stomach.

124
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:51,319
It's okay.
Just a bite.

125
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,816
I think it's
a lamb ragu

126
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,919
with just a scoop
of cold rigott'.

127
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,361
Holy shit.

128
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,558
It's all so fresh.
That fish with pistachios?

129
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,124
I feel like a traitor.

130
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:06,830
Vesuvio, lately,
it's depressing somehow.

131
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:09,203
Maybe they need to remodel
or something. I don't know.

132
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,299
That menu
is so tired.

133
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:14,209
- Hey, Homo Junior!
- Leave me the fuck alone!

134
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:18,341
Get... stop it!
Mom, they're hurting Vito!

135
00:10:18,382 --> 00:10:21,010
- Stop it!
- Where are your parents?

136
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:26,421
I guess she can't hide
her face at home.

137
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:29,551
It'd be like admitting
there was something wrong.

138
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:31,357
I should have brought
a pair of sweatpants

139
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:33,260
to change into.
I'm gonna explode.

140
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:36,266
Apparently,
there is still a veal loin

141
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,097
yet to be unveiled.

142
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:42,501
Please, don't get up.

143
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,303
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

144
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:45,969
That kid,
I'm tellin' you...

145
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,537
- Thank you.
- He was so handsome in that church.

146
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,344
The name he took, "Francis",
after my pop.

147
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:55,580
No restaurants in Brooklyn?
You gotta come all the way to Jersey?

148
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,078
This food, it's worth a detour.
Why? Is there a problem?

149
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:02,320
Artie's a friend of mine, you know?
I like to throw him some business.

150
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,022
Talk to you a minute?

151
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:09,696
Visited with John.

152
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:12,464
He said to tell you
he appreciates the recent headlines.

153
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:15,399
Rusty.

154
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,270
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

155
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:19,776
I turned him down
on that.

156
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,472
Madonn', you're
a cautious man.

157
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:25,107
You know, some people might feel
a little offended.

158
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:28,380
Me, my heart
is an open book.

159
00:11:32,023 --> 00:11:33,820
Anyway, Rusty's gone

160
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:35,826
and we'll chalk it up
to the headless horseman.

161
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,794
Giovanni.

162
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,297
Bravo!

163
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:08,892
Martina was just
tellin' me

164
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:10,917
that in Montenegro
I'd be the tallest guy.

165
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:12,827
Another fun fact
from the Balkans.

166
00:12:12,863 --> 00:12:14,956
Ben, are you up
for dessert?

167
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,728
No, I'm all set here.
Thanks.

168
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,735
Martina, sweetheart,

169
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:20,828
can I talk to you
for a second?

170
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,636
What is it, Artie?

171
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:27,737
You're looking at me
very serious.

172
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:29,746
You remember I had
that friend in Manhattan

173
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,977
that was gonna help speed you through
the green card process?

174
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:36,316
Apparently,
it's not happening.

175
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:38,914
- Why?
- Too much on his plate, he said.

176
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:41,481
I guess you're just gonna
have to do it yourself. I'm sorry.

177
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:44,790
All those forms.
Shit me.

178
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:47,320
I wish I could help you,
but really,

179
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:50,198
it's a small inconvenience compared
to living in freedom, right?

180
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:52,065
Yes, I know this.

181
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,908
Get him another 'buca.

182
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,407
Hey, Tony.

183
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:25,402
You could fuck her,
you know?

184
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:26,903
Well...

185
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:28,495
I'm not 100%
in that department,

186
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:31,667
but I'm startin'
to feel the old pressure.

187
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:35,436
It's funny,
'cause guys like me, we come here,

188
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,470
we get drunk
and stare.

189
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:40,416
Best-case scenario, we go
in the back room, we get a lap dance

190
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:43,943
a dry hump and...
blow in our pants.

191
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:49,885
Listen, you wanna fuck her so bad,
I'm sure it could be worked out.

192
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:51,986
Nah, I couldn't.

193
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:54,156
But you...

194
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,257
Well, what do you
want me to say?

195
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,700
Nothing.
It's just a fact.

196
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:01,068
If I knew you were gonna be
in such a pissy mood.

197
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:08,840
Gabriella Dante and Rosalie Aprile
came in for lunch yesterday.

198
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,710
So what, you wanna fuck
one of them now?

199
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:13,046
No.

200
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:15,712
Gab said you all went and had a meal
at Da Giovanni on Sunday.

201
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,719
Well, I was gonna
tell you.

202
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,287
It was Phil's grandson's confirmation.
It's a pain in the ass.

203
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,025
What are you gonna do?
You gotta eat.

204
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:30,556
It's nothing' special,
believe me.

205
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:34,901
Actually, Carm got a little sick after.
Too much oil, she thought.

206
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:36,770
Gab said
I should check it out,

207
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:38,297
like I could learn
something.

208
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:40,173
Well, she runs her mouth,
that one.

209
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:42,645
Fuck her.

210
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,740
Carm got sick.
Nice touch.

211
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:47,683
It was a business
obligation, Artie.

212
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:51,154
Last time I heard that,
I had to call the fire department.

213
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:53,281
Well, maybe you need another fresh start
to fuck up.

214
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:58,184
I should go.

215
00:14:58,229 --> 00:15:00,254
- Oh, come on, come on.
- No.

216
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:02,458
- I'm sorry. Have another one, come on.
- Forget it.

217
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,025
I know where
your heart is.

218
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:07,162
I gotta plan
the menu for tomorrow.

219
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:15,576
Fasanella,
my old man's a meat guy.

220
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:18,548
He said that the restaurant business
was like keeping an elephant.

221
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:22,040
It costs a fortune and sooner or later
it shits on your head.

222
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:25,685
I miss him.

223
00:15:25,723 --> 00:15:29,215
Hector had to trim
three inches off the fiorentinas.

224
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,785
Great. We can't even get
the good meat anymore.

225
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,389
Fucking Western Beef
is leaving us for dead.

226
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,727
I wanted you to call
their guy, but you were on the floor

227
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:40,634
talking to the Cohens'
mother-in-law.

228
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:43,196
You can't deal with the Western Beef
guy yourself,

229
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,265
my blushing flower?

230
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:48,369
It's not
the same from me.

231
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:50,380
And Arthur,

232
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:52,473
the chatting

233
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,643
with the guests...

234
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:56,175
Again, that's it.

235
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,950
It's not Hector or the meat
or these assholes

236
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:02,390
that are always looking
for the next hot thing. It's me.

237
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:05,395
Limit it to a quick
visit at coffee.

238
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:08,364
People wanna talk
to each other, not you.

239
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,493
Really? You know better
than New Jersey Zagat...

240
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:14,834
"Arthur Bucco,
warm and convivial host"?

241
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:35,385
Yeah, we're here
right now.

242
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:38,918
Sure, the broad strokes.
Perfect.

243
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:41,989
Kingsley's agent says
we grab lunch tomorrow, poolside.

244
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:44,262
- That guy, Jay?
- Yeah, I got him out of some trouble

245
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:45,768
on a party yacht
down in the Keys.

246
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:49,705
Ben Kingsley, can he do
a New Jersey accent?

247
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,970
Welcome
to the Viceroy.

248
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:54,477
I usually send
the bags up, hit the bar,

249
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:56,446
decompress a little,
unless you're against it.

250
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,313
- What are you talking about?
- You're in AA.

251
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,080
You gave the stewardess an earful
when she put down the champagne.

252
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:04,212
I just don't wanna make you feel
uncomfortable.

253
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:09,124
Relax.
I can deal with it.

254
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:11,024
Be careful
with this wine,

255
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:14,087
because the way
you two are looking at each other,

256
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:17,157
pretty soon
we're gonna have to...

257
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:19,965
put a high chair
right here.

258
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:28,337
Did you clip the daily-special cards
to all the menus?

259
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,743
Hey, Artie,

260
00:17:34,785 --> 00:17:36,685
come here.

261
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,382
You ready to order?

262
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:41,084
Why you kicking
her ass like that?

263
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,719
If you're referring
to the fact that she's my employee

264
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:46,559
and I'm telling her what to do, last
time I checked, that's the way it works.

265
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:49,430
She thinks you want her to cry.
I said not true.

266
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:51,093
She told you that?

267
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:53,069
'Cause you two
talk all the time.

268
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:55,663
- Yeah. So what?
- So, maybe you should hire her.

269
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:57,196
I know
how to treat people.

270
00:17:57,241 --> 00:18:00,870
- You're a people person, obviously.
- I am.

271
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:03,141
And when they're good to me,
they get treats.

272
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,274
And when they're not,
well, I got this severance thing I do.

273
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:08,342
It's a complete break,
actually.

274
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:12,718
I get it.

275
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:15,748
See, 'cause you talked around that
threat so much, I almost missed it.

276
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:17,351
Sorry to interrupt
you guys,

277
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:19,760
but, Arthur, you have
to plate the salmon.

278
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:24,460
Arthur, the kid
is a hood, okay?

279
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,435
If he feels protective
of his girlfriend,

280
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,097
you should just
leave it alone.

281
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:30,038
She's a slow learner.

282
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:32,565
She's a nice girl,
and as predicted,

283
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,077
the customers love her

284
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,511
with her little stories
from the old country.

285
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:38,242
You are just
picking on her.

286
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:40,876
It's disgusting.
He's a married man.

287
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:57,733
So it's 500 for the hour,
300 for half.

288
00:18:57,768 --> 00:19:00,328
And if you wanna keep
skiing, that's extra.

289
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:03,465
All right, Eden,
how's about 400 for 40

290
00:19:03,507 --> 00:19:07,375
and four more lines
and then we'll take it from there?

291
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,811
That'll work.

292
00:19:20,691 --> 00:19:22,488
Fuckin'-a.

293
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:24,153
Those are
some amazing tits.

294
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:27,322
Thank you, sweetie.

295
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:34,964
Carlo's running late.
Route 23, they think there's a sniper.

296
00:19:37,274 --> 00:19:40,141
Listen,
the other night...

297
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:42,042
it's this place.
You know, the rope's

298
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,707
a little tight
at my collar.

299
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:47,774
Down 40%
from last year.

300
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,113
- You need a little help?
- From you? God no.

301
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:53,987
Oh, there's the gratitude
I was looking for.

302
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:57,289
No, I mean I'm not
at that point, thank God.

303
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:59,557
But thank you.

304
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:01,621
Well, listen, the other day
I was driving along

305
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:04,065
and I was thinking
about your little problem.

306
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:06,467
How about a little promotion?
A coupon, two-for-one?

307
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:09,028
Two-fers, wow.

308
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:11,803
You mean, like you get
a free spaghetti and meatballs

309
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:14,242
if you bring another cheap gomer
douchebag in here?

310
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:17,145
How about an early-bird special?
Salad wagon?

311
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:19,911
This is a fine dining establishment.
I'll give it back to the bank

312
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,611
before I turn it
into a fucking IHOP.

313
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:23,984
Just send the waiter
over here.

314
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:27,354
You wanna help me so badly?
Try paying your tab.

315
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:28,949
- Excuse me?
- That little roast

316
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:31,961
you and the waste management people
threw for Dick Barone when he got sick,

317
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:34,054
40 fucking garbagemen
from around the country.

318
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:36,191
Of course you paid
Pat Cooper.

319
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:38,758
You paid
the entertainment.

320
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:20,777
Afternoon. We're looking
for Arthur Bucco.

321
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:23,575
- That's me.
- Dave Kloski. This is Jim Hollings.

322
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,750
American Express?
Funny, I had you two for cops.

323
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:32,654
In a past life.
Actually we're here to investigate

324
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:35,988
some recent irregularities in charge
activity here at Nuevo Vesuvio.

325
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:37,789
"Nuovo."
Irregularities?

326
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:40,729
Well, there is credit card fraud
going on in this restaurant.

327
00:21:40,764 --> 00:21:43,631
- That's impossible.
- Based on cardholder disputes,

328
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:46,500
we show nine hits in this locus
that precede fraudulent activity.

329
00:21:46,537 --> 00:21:48,698
- What does that mean?
- People's card numbers were copied

330
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:51,640
and those numbers were used to rack up
thousands of dollars in phony charges.

331
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:54,508
Wait, you think I'm ripping off
my own customers? That's insane.

332
00:21:54,545 --> 00:21:56,638
Were these meals
actually served?

333
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:00,941
Shit.

334
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:03,544
Councilman Carillo?
That was just two weeks ago.

335
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:05,111
So you understand
we have to suspend

336
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:07,419
the use of our cards here
pending an investigation.

337
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:09,425
Suspend?
You're cutting me off?

338
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:10,983
What's going on?

339
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:13,258
They're from Amex.
No more charges.

340
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:16,698
- What?!
- Someone's stealing!

341
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:19,065
Guys, this is like 30%
of my business here

342
00:22:19,102 --> 00:22:20,831
and I can't fucking
spare it right now!

343
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:23,863
Artie, please don't curse.
The minute you use profanity,

344
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:26,808
you give them the high moral ground
to do whatever they please.

345
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:28,607
We need copies
of your reservations

346
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:31,170
and a list of anyone who has access
to customer plastic.

347
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:38,550
I'm just asking, Jay.

348
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:40,921
Well, tell me again.

349
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,586
Why am I meeting
with these chaps?

350
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:48,386
Bollocks, Jay.
Bollocks!

351
00:22:52,035 --> 00:22:53,900
Oh, please.

352
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:00,503
Anyway, we appreciate
that your time

353
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:02,478
is less than limited,
so I'll cut to the chase.

354
00:23:02,512 --> 00:23:06,539
Log line, "The Ring" meets
"The Godfather."

355
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,643
Wiseguy, murdered,
I guess you could say,

356
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:12,018
seeks revenge on the man
who ordered it.

357
00:23:12,055 --> 00:23:13,522
You would play that man.

358
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:15,422
Which man?

359
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,427
Who are we kidding here?

360
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:20,055
You're Ben Kingsley.
You'd play the boss.

361
00:23:20,097 --> 00:23:23,589
I heard this idea,
I call Jay and I say,

362
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:26,034
"Sir Ben Kingsley,
no one else."

363
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:29,800
Well, you know, as ever,
it's script-dependent.

364
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:34,500
Oh, we got a sensational
writer, JT Dolan.

365
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:37,012
I'm embarrassed.
I haven't heard of him.

366
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:40,039
He's from TV,
"Nash Bridges," "Hooperman,"

367
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,517
and "Law & Order,
the SUV."

368
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:44,349
So there's a script?

369
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:46,185
We wanted to surmise
your interest

370
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:48,623
and then tailor the part
to your specificities.

371
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:53,057
No one plays a tough,
ruthless, hardhearted prick like you do.

372
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:55,030
You got it down,
trust me.

373
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:56,896
I take that
as quite a compliment.

374
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:59,334
Sure.
"Sexy Beast"?

375
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:01,735
Now, we do have
a shortlist of directors.

376
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:03,899
We could go A-list
down the horror genre,

377
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,704
Ridley, Tobe Hooper.

378
00:24:05,742 --> 00:24:09,473
Or we could try to find
the next James Wan. He did "Saw."

379
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:11,413
Did you see that?
Fuckin' brutal.

380
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:13,916
Betty?

381
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:17,512
It's Ben.
How are you?

382
00:24:17,554 --> 00:24:19,749
What on earth
are you doing out here?

383
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,758
Oh, I don't know.

384
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:27,259
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
Miss Lauren Bacall.

385
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:30,289
Lauren, this is Carmine Tazzi
and Christopher...

386
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,234
Moltisanti.
Huge fan.

387
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:34,134
- Thank you.
- "Lupertazzi."

388
00:24:34,171 --> 00:24:36,105
You were great
in "The Haves and Have-Nots."

389
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:39,074
Oh yes, dear Howard Hawks.
Thank you.

390
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:42,169
I'm a presenter
at one of these award shows,

391
00:24:42,212 --> 00:24:44,180
ShoWest,
some bullshit.

392
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:47,240
Oh, I did one of those years ago,
after "Death and the Maiden," I think.

393
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:49,548
They do take good care
of you, though.

394
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:52,384
I have a shiatsu
in about 10 minutes.

395
00:24:52,422 --> 00:24:55,448
- Wow.
- But let's catch up.

396
00:24:55,492 --> 00:24:57,084
Absolutely.
Great to see you.

397
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:59,857
- Thank you.
- As always.

398
00:24:59,896 --> 00:25:02,524
- So nice meeting both of you.
- Enjoy your success.

399
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:08,969
That reminds me,
I have a scheduling problem.

400
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:11,133
This meeting was last minute
and I'm supposed to be

401
00:25:11,174 --> 00:25:13,506
at the Luxury Lounge
at 2:00.

402
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:16,706
Yeah, but we haven't even gotten
to the particulars yet.

403
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:19,079
We'll walk with you.

404
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:24,187
I think this is
going very well.

405
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:26,018
You okay? You seem
a bit distracted.

406
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:29,389
It's fucking Sir Ben Kingsley is all.
Lauren Bacall.

407
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,463
- Yo.
- Murmur, I'm chipping here major.

408
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:40,163
Get on a plane.

409
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:43,104
Sir Ben Kingsley
and guests.

410
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,574
Janine will
take you around.

411
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:50,103
Hi, Janine.
Ben Kingsley.

412
00:25:50,147 --> 00:25:52,047
We're offering
the full services

413
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:54,346
of the spa today,
including massage.

414
00:25:54,384 --> 00:25:58,286
Listen, we're thinking about Sam
Rockwell for the younger guy.

415
00:25:58,321 --> 00:26:00,118
Is that a good chemistry for you?

416
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:02,250
May I offer you
champagne?

417
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:04,283
Maybe later.

418
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,928
This is Yael from Cosabella Lingerie.
Sir Ben Kingsley.

419
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:18,497
I'll take an extra large
in these.

420
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:23,879
For a man, White & Warm is giving
this cashmere throw,

421
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:27,350
great for the airplane,
and here, one for the car.

422
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:30,376
- Thanks, Yael.
- They charge this shit to the room?

423
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,945
This is Carla from Oris.

424
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:35,355
Men's and women's,
sporty and dressy.

425
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,623
A lot of guys are going
with the classic stainless chrono.

426
00:26:38,662 --> 00:26:42,154
Oh, my godson would love that.
He's having his birthday in three weeks.

427
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:45,794
- But for me...
- This is elegant.

428
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:47,701
- Really is.
- Take the chrono too?

429
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:50,900
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

430
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:58,078
Is all
this shit free?

431
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:00,549
I'm gettin' that.

432
00:27:04,387 --> 00:27:07,652
"True Crime,
New York City."

433
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:15,957
Pam has
a huge crush on you.

434
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:17,728
Thanks, Pam.

435
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:20,167
So Kingsley,
they do this all the time?

436
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,296
- It's Sir Ben, actually.
- Sorry.

437
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:25,604
A couple of times a year,
mainly clustered around award seasons.

438
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:27,735
How is that even
fuckin' possible?

439
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:29,711
I know.
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

440
00:27:29,746 --> 00:27:31,907
- I know I have one of these.
- Shelly from iRiver.

441
00:27:31,948 --> 00:27:34,143
I don't know
if you have this one.

442
00:27:34,184 --> 00:27:35,947
It's got 20 gigs of space
in a tiny package.

443
00:27:35,986 --> 00:27:39,353
That's 80 hours of video
or 600 hours of music.

444
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:41,619
Shelly, can I get
one of these?

445
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:44,684
- Here you go, Sir Ben.
- Thank you, Shelly.

446
00:27:44,728 --> 00:27:48,994
Sir Ben, you've got
a meeting with Doug in 10, so...

447
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:51,125
Hey, guys,

448
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,863
looks like I ate up
all our time here.

449
00:27:52,903 --> 00:27:54,768
What do you say
we catch up in New York?

450
00:27:54,804 --> 00:27:56,999
You got a lot
of tables left.

451
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,008
We're gonna make
that work, Sir Ben.

452
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:00,873
They're giving away
a Caddy over there!

453
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:03,436
Well, no, it's just a test-drive
for a couple of weeks.

454
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,779
You know, my family
gave me some sunglasses for Christmas

455
00:28:06,816 --> 00:28:09,842
so why don't you
have these?

456
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:11,376
I bet they'll look
great on you, Chris.

457
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:12,752
I don't know.
You think?

458
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:15,053
Sir Ben, can we get
a shot?

459
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:27,129
The thing, the Arabs.

460
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,695
Chris wanted me
to take care of you while he's away.

461
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:31,673
Cecil B DeMoltisanti
there.

462
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,574
- This is one week?
- Yeah, Murmur caught some big ones.

463
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:39,411
You're going to see your girlfriend
over at Vesuvio?

464
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:41,007
Yeah.

465
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:43,019
All right.

467
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:48,751
Give this to Artie.
Put it on my tab.

468
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:53,393
We're not here
to accuse anybody,

469
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,888
'cause Mainie and I
like to think of you all as family.

470
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:58,992
And this is
very serious.

471
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:02,232
It is, but know
that as family

472
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:03,739
you'll be treated
with respect

473
00:29:03,773 --> 00:29:06,936
and, if need be,
forgiveness.

474
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,771
Hector,
and you, mustache...

475
00:29:12,816 --> 00:29:15,717
You got
something to say?

476
00:29:15,752 --> 00:29:19,711
We have no intention of pressing
charges. It's just gotta stop.

477
00:29:19,756 --> 00:29:22,418
That's all we want.
Any questions?

478
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:29,157
Understand this is not
about a 42-oz. jar of Moroccan olives

479
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:31,224
or a couple of rolls
of toilet paper here.

480
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:33,429
- This is our livelihoods.
- Are you looking at me?

481
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,438
Nobody's looking
at anybody.

482
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:38,202
- I didn't take the toilet paper.
- But the olives?

483
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:40,675
I'm joking here.

484
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,907
I'm just saying
if you don't come clean to us,

485
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:45,744
those investigators,

486
00:29:45,782 --> 00:29:47,773
well, they just might
question the honesty

487
00:29:47,817 --> 00:29:49,910
of somebody
that wears a coat

488
00:29:49,953 --> 00:29:52,319
- pulled from the lost-and-found.
- Fuck this!

489
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:53,845
- No, fuck you!
- Arthur...

490
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,858
I don't know which one of
you pieces of shit did this,

491
00:29:55,892 --> 00:29:58,122
- but I've been good to you!
- ...getting us nowhere.

492
00:29:58,161 --> 00:30:00,129
And you pay me back
with nonstop ass-rape!

493
00:30:00,163 --> 00:30:02,063
Well fuck all of you!

494
00:30:14,878 --> 00:30:17,108
You know what?
Just forget it.

495
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:20,082
I... I'm so sorry,
everybody.

496
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:24,314
Could you just get this cleaned up
so we can open? Thanks.

497
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:27,618
No no. It's very bad.

498
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:29,750
They had
the credit card police.

499
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:31,090
Those companies
are huge.

500
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:33,595
They come on tough,
but in the end, they gotta eat it.

501
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,996
Okay.

502
00:30:44,674 --> 00:30:46,437
Everything okay
in there?

503
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:49,843
For once I'd like to eat
without you getting a call from work.

505
00:31:02,492 --> 00:31:04,483
God damn it.

506
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:21,208
Motherfucker.

507
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:22,836
Arthur!

508
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:25,677
What do you want, a repeat performance
of the Fourth of July?

509
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:27,410
That cop told you,

510
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,884
no firing guns in
the borough limits.

511
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,910
I brought those
arugula seeds

512
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:33,946
all the way back from Italy
in my shaving kit.

513
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,452
Eden, get the fuck
out of there!

514
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:44,524
- Fuck off.
- I wasn't going through your purse!

515
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,159
I was movin' it
and it fell.

516
00:31:46,202 --> 00:31:48,762
Go fuck yourself,
you guinea bastard!

517
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,502
Good afternoon,
Mr. Moltisanti.

518
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:57,513
Room 812, please.

519
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:06,254
- Yes.
- Hey, Sir Kingsley.

520
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:08,780
It's Chris Moltisanti
from yesterday?

521
00:32:08,825 --> 00:32:10,452
I spoke with Jay

522
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:12,893
and he's working on that
New York meeting right now.

523
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:16,023
Fine, but that's not
what I'm calling about, though.

524
00:32:16,065 --> 00:32:18,533
That Luxury Lounge thing,
can you get me in there?

525
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:21,366
I don't know. My publicist
handles all that stuff.

526
00:32:21,404 --> 00:32:23,872
- So, can you call 'em?
- I don't know

527
00:32:23,907 --> 00:32:26,899
how my publicist
can help you, you know?

528
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:28,740
All right.

529
00:32:28,778 --> 00:32:31,906
Yeah, in the city then.
My partner went back.

530
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:33,779
Friend of his died
recently. Guy's wife

531
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:35,944
is having a breakdown.
He'll call you.

532
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:45,717
That's security, Eden!
They're gonna blow that door open!

533
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:47,855
Fuck you!

534
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:55,163
- Fuck.
- I know, I gotta get it together.

535
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:58,504
Black truffle doesn't have the intensity
of white so you gotta use more.

536
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:01,442
I'll be at my investing club
at the Learning Annex with my cell

537
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:04,914
if you have to call,
but try not to.

538
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:07,678
Sandy,
about the meeting...

539
00:33:07,717 --> 00:33:09,548
- Oh, everybody knows you're upset.
- I know.

540
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:12,180
But Alonzo's coat,
you told me that in confidence.

541
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:13,689
I thought you
needed to know.

542
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:16,487
I also think, well,
it's probably nothing,

543
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:19,984
but yesterday Martina
was showing off these Caovilla sandals.

544
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,393
I know she makes
more than me,

545
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:25,663
but they cost
like $600.

546
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,438
You should get back
to the coatroom.

547
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:34,041
Hold on a second.
I wanna ask you something.

548
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:42,483
- I knew it.
- I'm sorry. I'll pay you back.

549
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:45,613
- How could you do this to me?
- You were so mean to me.

550
00:33:45,655 --> 00:33:48,647
Like helping you find the apartment?
Teaching you to drive?

551
00:33:48,691 --> 00:33:51,888
As soon as you found out I wasn't going
to fuck you, you started picking on me.

552
00:33:51,928 --> 00:33:55,557
I wanna fuck you? You certainly have
a high opinion of yourself.

553
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:57,896
You stare at me
like food.

554
00:33:57,934 --> 00:34:00,232
Well I never
fuck you.

555
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,397
- I go to Benny and we laugh at you...
- Benny.

556
00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:04,167
when I fuck him
in the pile of money

557
00:34:04,207 --> 00:34:06,266
that we take from
your stupid customers.

558
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:08,743
You're fired.

559
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:10,746
Oh yeah?
Oh, who's laughing now?

560
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,647
What do you think? I can't press charges
'cause of my friendship with Tony?!

561
00:34:13,683 --> 00:34:15,344
Three months
you worked here!

562
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:17,046
You think that doesn't go
on your permanent record?!

563
00:34:17,086 --> 00:34:19,919
We lead the world
in computerized data collection!

564
00:34:44,013 --> 00:34:45,947
Artie, you know
what time it is?

565
00:34:45,982 --> 00:34:48,542
- We need to talk.
- Now?

566
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:50,450
My wife is pregnant.
She needs to sleep.

567
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:52,852
Martina told me about your little
credit card business.

568
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,720
Step outside, Ben.

569
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:59,193
I'll be outside
a minute, honey.

570
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:02,928
Look.

571
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:06,094
You're upset,
all right?

572
00:35:06,135 --> 00:35:08,603
But it's not my fault
that little trick got greedy.

573
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:10,333
Oh, so she's
a little trick, huh?

574
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:12,637
I was gonna cut you in,
but now you're acting stupid.

575
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:15,143
Regular people are
all fucking stupid.

576
00:35:23,419 --> 00:35:25,410
You want some more?!

577
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:34,096
Piece of dogshit!
Little, crazy,

578
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,496
motherfucking
meatball dogshit!

579
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:51,677
Yeah, I'm stupid.

580
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:09,129
There he is.

581
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:11,156
How you doing?

582
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,169
- Great, thanks.
- This is Murmur.

583
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:18,369
- You heading to the pool?
- Massage.

585
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,174
Listen. You get a chance to call about
that Luxury Lounge for me?

586
00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:25,203
Well, it's like
I explained...

587
00:36:26,482 --> 00:36:28,450
there's nothing very much
I can do about it.

588
00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:31,351
- They decide whom they give it to.
- Very important people,

589
00:36:31,387 --> 00:36:34,322
like you, right? 'Cause you're a very
important person.

590
00:36:34,357 --> 00:36:36,348
To them, I guess.

591
00:36:38,695 --> 00:36:41,789
Murmur's an interesting name.
What's the genesis?

592
00:36:41,831 --> 00:36:45,289
I had a heart murmur
when I was a kid.

593
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:47,461
They just keep
handing stuff out, huh?

594
00:36:47,503 --> 00:36:49,471
The coolest shit
in the world

595
00:36:49,505 --> 00:36:51,336
to the people
who need it the least.

596
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:02,173
Look. I think you've
misunderstood something.

597
00:37:02,218 --> 00:37:04,948
I give most
of that stuff away

598
00:37:04,987 --> 00:37:07,820
to homeless shelters,
the rest I give to charity auctions.

599
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:10,792
- Not to your godson?
- I agree with you,

600
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:13,227
the whole thing's obscene,
and it's nothing

601
00:37:13,262 --> 00:37:15,287
compared to the situation
at award shows.

602
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:18,732
Presenters get about $30,000 worth of
merchandise

603
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:20,531
in those baskets.

604
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,367
That's a year's salary
for some people.

605
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:24,236
Go figure.

606
00:37:24,273 --> 00:37:26,764
Hopefully we can spread
some of that lolly around.

607
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,208
We'll get you
that script.

608
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:41,956
Hell of a tub here, guys.

609
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:44,892
Sea, sun. I'm gonna
make it my second home.

610
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:48,260
- Anybody else hungry? Huh?
- We'll get lunch started.

611
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:50,925
- Artie, another margarita?
- I could say no, but I won't.

612
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,588
You lost
your fucking mind?

613
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:15,523
The shit you're in with that kid,
which you brought on yourself.

614
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:17,719
Brought on myself?
Oh, I suppose you let

615
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,422
a certain element into your world,
you're asking for it.

616
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:22,954
Jesus fucking Christ, Tony,

617
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:24,489
how could you pull
that scam at my place?

618
00:38:24,534 --> 00:38:27,298
Come on, you know I never would've
let that happen if I'd known.

619
00:38:27,336 --> 00:38:29,702
You're innocent, I get it.
I'm just another victim

620
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:32,139
- of Benny Fazio, criminal mastermind.
- That's right.

621
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:35,144
And once you found out,
instead of putting him in the E.R.,

622
00:38:35,178 --> 00:38:37,669
you should've come to me.
He says he's gonna kill you, Artie.

623
00:38:37,713 --> 00:38:40,341
I can't take
American Express now, Ton'.

624
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:43,716
You know what that means? I have
to start with the fucking two-fers.

625
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:46,779
My accountant insisted.
Are you happy?

626
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:48,586
Life's not fair.
Right, I know.

627
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:51,149
But somehow I believed my dad's crap
about honest work.

628
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:54,561
He used to say
to me, "You'll see.

629
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:56,895
Pays off in the end."

630
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:58,457
What a joke.

631
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:07,872
I hate to see you like this,
you know that.

632
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,708
'Cause you start
thinking crazy shit.

633
00:39:13,115 --> 00:39:14,980
Who's hungry?

634
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,690
- Yeah?
- Ben Kingsley passed.

635
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:28,594
Fuck.

636
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:31,767
You know, I tried
to be his friend,

637
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:33,860
I sent a muffin basket
with the script,

638
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:35,803
I tried everything.

639
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:44,141
You can kill me after
if you want,

640
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,774
- but he's a fucking dead man.
- Calm down, Ben.

641
00:39:46,816 --> 00:39:50,047
He came to my house,
Tony, where my wife was watching TV.

642
00:39:50,086 --> 00:39:53,249
My wife, who's carrying
my unborn son.

643
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:55,757
I'm gonna take him to
that warehouse in Paterson

644
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:58,089
- and drive fucking...
- Nails into his balls. I know.

645
00:39:58,127 --> 00:40:00,652
I heard you
the first time.

646
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:08,226
- You're having a son, huh?
- They showed us his cannoli

647
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:11,763
on the ultrasound
like a month ago.

648
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:14,332
That's beautiful.

649
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:18,779
Oh, congratulations.

650
00:40:18,814 --> 00:40:20,907
Thank you.

651
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,077
I'm gonna tell you
this once,

652
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,553
it's over.
You drop it.

653
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:29,217
And frankly you should be very happy
I'm not gonna tax you.

654
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:32,352
I mean beside the fact you know
I grew up with the man,

655
00:40:32,395 --> 00:40:34,363
you don't shit
where you eat.

656
00:40:34,397 --> 00:40:36,729
And you really don't shit
where I eat.

657
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:39,462
I know, and I'm sorry
about that, but...

658
00:40:39,502 --> 00:40:41,595
And your parents'
anniversary party?

659
00:40:41,637 --> 00:40:43,901
It's not going to be at Da Giovanni's.
It's gonna be at Vesuvio.

660
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,773
What? Tony,
look at my face.

661
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:49,607
He's going to apologize
to you, and give you a rate.

662
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,943
He's hurtin' too.
And it's the least you can do.

663
00:40:59,188 --> 00:41:01,782
Well Ms. Bacall, your limo
is second in line there.

664
00:41:01,824 --> 00:41:04,292
Oh, well I can take it
from here.

665
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:06,454
- You sure?
- Yeah, thank you so much.

666
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:08,190
- Okay, you're welcome.
- Good night.

667
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,925
Night.

668
00:41:13,703 --> 00:41:15,830
- Get the fuck away from me!
- What are you doing?!

669
00:41:17,673 --> 00:41:19,573
Somebody help us!

670
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:21,803
Those guys!

671
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:27,211
Ms. Bacall,
don't move.

672
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:30,650
Yes, an ambulance
by Robinsons-May.

673
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:34,679
Oh Jesus,
my fucking arm.

674
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:42,590
No.

675
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:46,764
There's a line outside.

676
00:41:48,537 --> 00:41:51,700
Okay, push the scampi. Wholesaler
says they gotta get eaten tonight.

677
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:55,404
And don't spread out too much. We still
got the Fazio party in the banquet room.

678
00:41:58,614 --> 00:42:00,707
Okay, Sandy.
Open the door.

679
00:42:04,553 --> 00:42:07,317
Hello. Welcome.

680
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:09,654
Do you have
low-salt selections?

682
00:42:17,299 --> 00:42:19,927
Ma, Pop,
order whatever you want.

683
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:22,437
I'm having
that loin of veal.

684
00:42:22,471 --> 00:42:24,701
That's
the other place, Ma.

685
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:31,813
This the young couple?

686
00:42:31,847 --> 00:42:33,747
Yes, my mom and dad.

687
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:35,273
Cent'anni!

688
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:38,252
- Hundred years!
- Cent'anni!

689
00:42:40,022 --> 00:42:43,321
Well, I hope you all enjoy.
You're all set for wine, cocktails?

690
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,990
- Nothing?
- Fine, thanks.

691
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:52,294
Benny, can I get
you a Martina?

692
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:54,029
- Excuse me?
- A Martina.

693
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,868
It's like a Martini,
but it's from Albania.

694
00:42:56,906 --> 00:42:58,373
I never heard of it.

695
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:01,001
Well, apparently
they go down real easy.

696
00:43:01,043 --> 00:43:02,704
Right, Ben?

697
00:43:05,247 --> 00:43:07,511
We're gonna look
at the menu.

698
00:43:08,584 --> 00:43:10,779
Good enough.

699
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,487
- You order for me.
- Fine. The monkfish.

700
00:43:17,526 --> 00:43:19,960
There's such
a strange consistency.

701
00:43:30,573 --> 00:43:32,905
In front of my wife?!

702
00:43:32,942 --> 00:43:35,035
Fuck!

703
00:43:35,077 --> 00:43:36,977
Jesus! Fuck, my hand!

704
00:43:37,012 --> 00:43:39,913
Shit! Oh God!
Oh fuck!

705
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:43,575
Fuck! My hand!

706
00:43:46,021 --> 00:43:48,956
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

707
00:43:48,991 --> 00:43:53,155
Oh my God, Arthur!
Somebody call 911 please!

708
00:44:21,123 --> 00:44:23,455
Look at this.

709
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:34,330
I had no idea.
I'd have booked another flight.

710
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,429
Fuck.

711
00:44:42,711 --> 00:44:44,576
Where is everybody?

712
00:44:44,613 --> 00:44:46,410
My father-in-law
don't wanna come.

713
00:44:46,448 --> 00:44:48,416
Him and Carm
aren't speaking.

714
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:51,908
- How's the meathook?
- Had to be my fuckin' saute hand, huh?

715
00:44:51,954 --> 00:44:54,115
Why, you got an okay
crowd here today.

716
00:44:54,156 --> 00:44:56,351
Sunday pasta's
the last thing to go.

717
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:58,519
The place is on life-support
ever since word got out

718
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:00,392
to the regulars
about their credit cards.

719
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:03,023
And my staff is pissed off
about Martina leaving.

720
00:45:03,065 --> 00:45:05,829
Benny did a real
number here, Tony.

721
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:09,099
Who knows?
Maybe it's cursed. The fire, then this.

722
00:45:09,138 --> 00:45:10,730
Will you stop talkin'
like an old lady?

723
00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:13,139
- Artie.
- No go, huh?

724
00:45:13,175 --> 00:45:15,769
He's just
being dramatic.

725
00:45:17,046 --> 00:45:18,707
- How are you, sweetie?
- Better.

726
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:21,375
And Carm,
the flowers...

727
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:26,377
Tonight, only the best

728
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:28,014
for the best people.

729
00:45:35,397 --> 00:45:37,228
That's excellent.

730
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,606
Hey, be careful you two,

731
00:45:46,642 --> 00:45:48,542
because the way
you two are looking at each other,

732
00:45:48,577 --> 00:45:51,671
pretty soon we'll have
to put a high chair over here.

733
00:45:51,714 --> 00:45:54,547
Like the icing on a cake, okay?
Capisce?

734
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:56,676
Keep your thumbs
out of the food.

735
00:46:01,857 --> 00:46:04,257
We gotta talk
about your problem.

736
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:06,124
Oh, great.
Another idea.

737
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:08,288
How 'bout a strolling accordionist?

738
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:13,193
I'm gonna give you the name
of a good psychiatrist.

739
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:15,601
She's Italian.
You'll like her.

740
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:19,433
You know what?
You go about in pity for yourself.

741
00:46:19,475 --> 00:46:22,035
- I go about in pity for myself?
- Yeah.

742
00:46:22,077 --> 00:46:24,136
I gotta tell you,
Bodhisattva,

743
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:26,238
that is fucking
priceless.

744
00:46:26,282 --> 00:46:28,842
Use the other door.

745
00:46:28,884 --> 00:46:31,216
You bitch and you moan
and you blame

746
00:46:31,253 --> 00:46:33,346
everybody else
for your problems,

747
00:46:33,389 --> 00:46:37,485
instead of maybe, not letting
the Mexicans do all the cooking for you

748
00:46:37,526 --> 00:46:40,791
or, I don't know, changing the menu
or changing the decor.

749
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:43,992
I guess because you know how to eat,
you know how to run a restaurant.

750
00:46:46,669 --> 00:46:48,864
On one of the bleakest
nights of my life,

751
00:46:48,904 --> 00:46:53,705
after the shit with my
mother and that fuckin' storm outside,

752
00:46:53,742 --> 00:46:56,438
I came here
to this place.

753
00:46:56,478 --> 00:46:59,345
I sat out there
with Carm and my two kids

754
00:46:59,381 --> 00:47:01,975
and we ate and we drank
and we were so happy to be here,

755
00:47:02,017 --> 00:47:04,178
more than any other
place in the world.

756
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:06,915
And you know I'm gonna
eat here until I fall off the chair.

757
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:11,684
But in business,
sometimes shit happens.

758
00:47:11,727 --> 00:47:14,218
The playing field
changes, whatever.

759
00:47:14,263 --> 00:47:17,460
And you gotta do whatever you gotta do
to keep your dick up.

760
00:47:20,336 --> 00:47:23,169
If you hate it here so much,
why don't you go to Da Giovanni?

761
00:47:23,205 --> 00:47:25,833
See if he'll cook you that bland shit
for your shot-up pancreas.

762
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:33,244
I'll tell you one thing

763
00:47:33,282 --> 00:47:35,250
and this is very hard,

764
00:47:35,284 --> 00:47:37,115
nobody wants
to hear you talk.

765
00:47:37,152 --> 00:47:40,986
They're trying to eat out there
and you come along

766
00:47:41,023 --> 00:47:43,856
with your corny jokes
and your stupid stories.

767
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:47,759
Just stay
in the kitchen.

768
00:47:47,796 --> 00:47:50,196
That'd be a start.

769
00:48:04,413 --> 00:48:06,176
Hey.

770
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:12,147
You wouldn't believe
what these people in the business get,

771
00:48:12,187 --> 00:48:14,519
totally fuckin'
absolutely gratis.

772
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:16,649
Yeah, I hear the streets
are paved with hand jobs.

773
00:48:16,692 --> 00:48:20,150
Right. I scored
some major swag.

774
00:48:20,195 --> 00:48:22,390
A little taste for you.

775
00:48:24,299 --> 00:48:26,529
Trip to Australia,
first-class vouchers,

776
00:48:26,568 --> 00:48:28,399
some kind of
golf resort.

777
00:48:28,437 --> 00:48:30,928
Looks like Sarasota.

778
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:34,534
After what,
a 20-hour flight? No.

779
00:48:50,692 --> 00:48:52,956
That's for a pocket dog.

780
00:48:58,133 --> 00:48:59,828
How'd it go
with the movie star?

781
00:48:59,868 --> 00:49:02,928
He was all over us,
but I don't think he's right.

782
00:49:02,971 --> 00:49:05,940
We made some great contacts.
Plus we saw Lindsay Lohan.

783
00:49:05,974 --> 00:49:07,635
Total piece of ass.

784
00:49:10,212 --> 00:49:12,112
You hear Artie
burned his hand?

785
00:49:12,147 --> 00:49:16,277
Yeah. Him and Benny.
How crazy is that?

786
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:18,286
- He okay?
- A layer of skin

787
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,185
came off his hand
like a glove.

788
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:23,453
But, they said, you know,
no scarring, no grafts.

789
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:26,188
Lucky.

790
00:49:27,629 --> 00:49:29,859
Well, not for nothin'.
I couldn't help but thinkin'

791
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:33,459
if you were here
watching your crew,

792
00:49:33,502 --> 00:49:35,470
things wouldn't have gone
the way they did.

793
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:37,529
You let me go, T.

794
00:49:37,573 --> 00:49:40,098
I asked you. Now it's my fault Artie
and Benny got into it?

795
00:49:40,142 --> 00:49:44,044
This is what I was concerned about,
Christopher, the loss of focus.

796
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,604
Look...

797
00:49:46,648 --> 00:49:50,709
not many guys have had to make
the kind of sacrifice I did.

798
00:49:50,752 --> 00:49:53,243
How many times you gonna play
the Adriana card?

799
00:50:03,398 --> 00:50:05,525
Sandy just seated
a couple.

800
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:07,262
Kitchen's closed.

801
00:50:07,302 --> 00:50:10,465
He said they were supposed to go
to the city but they had car trouble.

802
00:50:12,441 --> 00:50:14,204
Hector already left
to pick up his wife.

803
00:50:14,243 --> 00:50:16,711
Plus I got nothing
back here, Charm.

804
00:50:16,745 --> 00:50:18,804
They already opened
the bottle.

805
00:50:29,525 --> 00:50:31,425
They're gonna have to eat
what I give them.

806
00:51:24,112 --> 00:51:27,275
Arthur, a lot of people
don't like rabbit.

807
00:51:27,316 --> 00:51:28,806
My grandfather's way.

808
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,545
Only with Provenal elements
I been thinking about.

809
00:51:30,586 --> 00:51:33,111
I thought you were taking
it to him at the home.

810
00:51:33,155 --> 00:51:36,921
Okay, out.
I wanna get outta here tonight.
