1
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:03,911
- I'm laying out. You coming?
- The UV index is 10.

2
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:07,179
Jesus, we don't do anything.
We don't eat.

3
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:10,585
We don't go out.
God knows we don't do anything else.

4
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:13,489
Is that all you
ever think about, sex?

5
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:17,154
All I ever think about?
You haven't fucked me in over a year.

6
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:20,653
Blood sugar, I told you,
the weight loss.

7
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:26,763
Good, fine.
Skin cancer.

8
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,577
What's up?

9
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:40,112
Thing we talked
about at the wedding.

10
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,311
Rusty.

11
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:42,944
You made the call
to Italy.

12
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:45,455
Our friend over there's
gonna fit him for a suit.

13
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,685
She's sending over
two of her best tailors.

14
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:49,819
So I should meet 'em
at the airport?

15
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:52,352
No, they're gonna call
you when they arrive.

16
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:55,298
Now you hook 'em up
with a third party, huh?

17
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,666
Get 'em some scissors.

18
00:03:58,703 --> 00:04:01,672
This is smart, Ton',
the more I think about it.

19
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:03,264
Glad you approve.

20
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:06,141
Anybody taking a look,
there's nothing linking us to it.

21
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:08,145
- Hey, good seeing you.
- Hey, there he is.

23
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:13,874
How are you?

24
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:17,820
Listen,
come here a minute.

25
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:19,915
About the other day...

26
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,926
I'm fine.
A couple of stitches.

27
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,589
Yeah? My fucking
temper, you know?

28
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,689
No no no no,
it's okay, really.

29
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:30,064
Take it.

30
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:32,001
Thanks.

31
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:34,436
Look, Ton',

32
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:36,838
I don't remember slamming
the refrigerator door,

33
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,241
but Carlo told me
and my dad,

34
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:43,407
I never should have raised my hands
to you. I'm sorry.

35
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:46,144
As long as
you realize.

37
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,686
It basically became
the same thing every day.

38
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:54,021
Coffee,
couple lines of meth,

39
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:57,459
smooth that out
with a shot of Jameson.

40
00:04:57,495 --> 00:05:00,726
And that was just
to drive the kids to school.

41
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:07,736
Then one day I fell asleep at work
and forgot about Gracie's recital.

42
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,076
Human frailty, it makes
me sick sometimes.

43
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:25,413
- Chris, right?
- Should I know you?

44
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:27,981
Kevin Mucci, Yonkers.

45
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:30,551
We met at the Trotters.
Sal lacuzzo's cousin.

46
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:32,290
- Right. Hey.
- Hey.

47
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,922
Yonkers,
what are you, lost?

48
00:05:33,965 --> 00:05:36,729
My ex's birthday over
at the Red Robin in Clifton.

49
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:38,360
I figured I'd need a meeting
to make it through that shit.

50
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:40,769
I hear that.

51
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:42,830
So I saw my cousin
this week.

52
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:46,867
It turns out he ran into a friend
of yours, the big guy, Vito.

53
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:49,311
And...

54
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:53,147
He was in a fag bar,
dancing with a guy.

55
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:56,186
Get the fuck out!

56
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,092
Right, Joey, use your head.

57
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:14,229
You are not gonna
fucking believe this.

58
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:16,502
Vito Spatafore's
an ass-muncher.

59
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,271
- Oh! What?
- What did you just say?

60
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,971
I'm sorry, it's true.

61
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:25,449
We ran into this kid. Vito was spotted
in a fag bar in New York.

62
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:27,348
By who?

63
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:30,650
The kid's cousin.
Allegedly.

64
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:32,349
Probably bullshit.

65
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,915
- He's a married man.
- With a goomar.

66
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,018
All right,
back up a second.

67
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:39,029
What did the kid
say exactly?

68
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:42,931
- The kid's cousin Sal lacuzzo...
- From Yonkers, I know him.

69
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:46,994
Sal was at this place in the city,
supposedly on business.

70
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,871
He saw Vito holding hands
with a guy in nipple rings.

71
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:52,001
You're leaving out
the best part.

72
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:56,244
He was wearing
a motorcycle outfit,

73
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:58,806
like the guy in the Village People
with the leather hat

74
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,819
- and the vest.
- Chaps too.

75
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:08,354
I don't know.
Fucking slander, ask me.

76
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:12,287
All right, let's take this
in the back.

77
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,993
- Yeah, that's what Vito did.
- You can go.

78
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:22,400
Tell you one thing, if it was me this
kid was spreading rumors about,

79
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,340
he'd have something up
his own ass.

80
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,138
And it wouldn't be
no cock, either.

81
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:28,475
That's the point,
though.

82
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:30,674
This guy Sal,
I know him.

83
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:34,708
- He's a friend of ours.
- I fucking called it, long time ago.

84
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:36,845
You knew Vito
was a recchion'?

85
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,583
- Yes.
- When?

86
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:40,523
I never said it,
but I knew.

87
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:42,583
Get the fuck out.
Enough of this rush to judgment.

88
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:45,721
For all we know, this fucking Sal guy's
got a hard-on for Vito.

89
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:49,161
Oh, you think
this is funny, huh?

90
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,361
There's a man's reputation
at stake here.

91
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:53,029
A married man,
with kids.

92
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:56,370
Nah, that don't mean shit.
Elton John was married.

93
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:58,875
Yeah, Rock Hudson too.
I think.

94
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,937
So what do we gotta do, Ton',
actually see him take it in the ass?

95
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:06,280
Get Vito
on the phone.

96
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:12,450
You know, he called me
the other night.

97
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,617
3:00 in the morning,
after the wedding.

98
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:16,320
And?

99
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:19,797
Honestly, it was weird.
He wanted to know what was going on.

100
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:22,595
He was fucking fishing,
see if we heard.

101
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:26,767
Straight to voice mail.

102
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:29,034
Ton', I mean,
he represents us.

103
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:31,041
I'm not gonna condemn
the man off the word

104
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:33,066
of some fucking douchebag
from Yonkers.

105
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:37,343
- I could care less, basically.
- Yeah? Maybe you're a flambe.

106
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:39,441
Fucking nauseating.

107
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:42,578
It was up to me, I'd drag Vito behind
my fucking car right now.

108
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,953
Will you take it easy over there,
fucking Judge Roy Bean?

109
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,254
One of my bar girls
knows his goomar.

110
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:51,819
We'll check with her. Maybe she's seen
him and knows where he is.

111
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:53,330
Loren.

112
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:01,370
Think about it,
though, Ton'...

113
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:04,204
sudden weight loss.

114
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:07,302
- AIDS?
- Nobody's got AIDS.

115
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:10,940
I don't wanna hear
that word in here again!

116
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:16,179
The Federal Prosecutor's office won't
tell you why your son's being held?

117
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,712
Or where. It has been four days
now since he's been arrested,

118
00:09:19,757 --> 00:09:21,952
and we have no money
to hire a lawyer.

119
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:24,518
- How did you hear about the law center?
- You will write the...

120
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:26,757
Habeas corpus?
I'm not an attorney yet.

121
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:29,824
I'm a volunteer assistant.
One of our attorneys will file the writ.

122
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:33,667
- He is a good boy.
- The FBI went to his school

123
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:36,195
and took him like a criminal.
This is America?

124
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,970
It's not easy
to be Muslim now.

125
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,171
They wouldn't let Afaf skate
at the local rink

126
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:44,613
- unless she removed her headscarf.
- You're kidding me, why?

127
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:46,617
They said it was
for insurance.

128
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:48,619
It might fall off
and someone could trip.

129
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:51,850
If she had been wearing a yarmulke,
it would have been a different story.

130
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,880
You can bet.

131
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:57,795
They're these poor,
hardworking people.

132
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:00,161
- Finn, you're not eating?
- Coffee's good.

133
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:02,689
The government is just completely
fucking this family over.

134
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:05,099
When did it start she could use that
kind of language

135
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:07,001
in this house
with immunity?

136
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:09,802
I'm telling Mom about these people
that came into the office yesterday.

137
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:13,242
Let me guess, was it a crack
whore trying to get her kids back

138
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:14,904
for the welfare money?

139
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:17,642
Actually, it was a family from
Afghanistan who fled the Taliban

140
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:19,479
and sweated out
Visa lotteries

141
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:23,078
in a refugee camp,
and hold down three jobs.

142
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:26,648
You think it's funny? The FBI
snatched their son off the street

143
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,921
like we're some
third-world dictatorship.

144
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,325
Pretty scary.

145
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,226
There must have
been some reason, Meadow.

146
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:34,458
- Like he's a terrorist, maybe.
- 9-11, 9-11.

147
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:37,900
Bush is using it as an excuse to erode
our Constitutional protections,

148
00:10:37,935 --> 00:10:41,268
- and you're falling for it.
- Well, I voted for him.

149
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:45,605
Right, well, you don't
relate to black people clinging to logs.

150
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,274
You oughta chill out
about some of this.

151
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:00,647
Hey.

152
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,392
Let me ask you
something,

153
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:12,527
those two Arabs

154
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,006
with the credit cards,
Fazool and whatever his name is...

155
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,371
Yeah?

156
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:20,866
you think there's a chance
they could be...

157
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:23,574
I don't know, Al-Qaedas,
something like that?

159
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:31,444
You know at one point
it did cross my mind.

160
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,252
Yeah, and?

161
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,589
I don't think so.

162
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:38,151
They're gun nuts
but the smaller guy Ahmed,

163
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:40,323
when those Danish cartoons
got published,

164
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:42,298
he was very upset,
but at the protestors.

165
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,301
He said he hated
the cartoons

166
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:47,771
but that the rioting shit would just
bring bad attention to all Muslims.

167
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:49,898
And the other guy
Mohammed, his brother's

168
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:51,636
a government interrogator
in Lebanon

169
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,940
or Syria.

170
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:56,606
Plus Mohammed and his
girlfriend have a dog,

171
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:58,774
a springer spaniel.

172
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:03,220
I'm gonna get a coffee.

173
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:32,947
Vito, what the fuck
you doing?

174
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:34,952
- Tony's looking for you.
- For me?

175
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:36,977
He's been calling
for fucking days.

176
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:40,013
My goddamn phone, Jesus. Everything all
right?

177
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:41,820
You tell us.

178
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:45,056
I'm good.
Tell Tony I'll call him.

179
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:48,259
It's better you come in.

180
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,267
Sure.

181
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:54,398
You go ahead,
and I'll follow you.

182
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:04,814
What?

183
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:06,840
What are you doing?!

184
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,511
Motherfucker!

185
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,645
Fucking finook.

186
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:14,886
Lying piece of shit.

187
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:17,519
Better not come
around here no more.

188
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:42,251
Hey.

189
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:45,619
You speak Ital, right?

190
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,715
Some friends
coming over from Naples,

191
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:50,192
paying a visit to a guy
from New York.

192
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:54,527
- Who?
- The little guy in Ozone Park.

193
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,591
That's pretty high up.

194
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:02,528
You should provide 'em
a couple of dumb gats,

195
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:04,473
guidance on where
to find him.

196
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:06,806
How do I get
ahold of them?

197
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:10,177
Just leave your phone on.

198
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:12,444
Part two when it's done.

199
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:21,886
I hear fat Vito's been riding up
the Hershey Highway.

200
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:24,759
- Where'd you get that?
- Come on.

201
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:27,286
Somebody started a joke.
I won't mention any names.

202
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,458
There's no truth to it.

203
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:34,063
It's a fucking captain
you're talking about.

204
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:40,336
People went to see him.
He was down the shore with his goomar.

205
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:42,312
So it's bullshit then.

206
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:47,346
As soon as he saw 'em,
took off like a bat out of hell.

207
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:49,182
Fuck.

208
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,188
You didn't hear it
from me.

209
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,190
It could be
a mid-life thing.

210
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:56,625
Sucking a cock?

211
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:02,366
Mr. Spatafore, hey.

212
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,459
Marie's still at the hospital
with her mom.

213
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:08,336
- Kids asleep?
- They went to sleep about an hour ago.

214
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,408
Fuck!

215
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:59,837
Hi.
How are you doing?

216
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:02,141
I need a room
for the night.

217
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,340
I don't have anybody down
for a reservation.

218
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:06,372
The sign said "Vacancy."

219
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:10,444
Oh, we have rooms. We usually don't
get walk-ins. Come in.

220
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:23,258
Glad to have you. Slow around here until
the leaf peepers show up.

221
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,995
Let me show you
where we serve breakfast.

222
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:26,525
I just want to go to my room.

223
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,334
No problem. It's $140,
breakfast included.

224
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:32,171
- MasterCard or Visa.
- I'll pay cash.

225
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,439
We accept that too.

226
00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:36,776
But you can take care
of it in the morning.

227
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:41,114
I'm just beat,
that's all.

228
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:42,982
My car broke down.

229
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,511
On a night
like this too.

230
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:47,615
You know, my stepson
runs the tow service.

231
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:52,118
You want, early morning, I can have
your rig brought to the Mobil.

232
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:54,221
Yeah?

233
00:18:54,264 --> 00:18:56,061
Black Cadillac.

234
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,592
Route 228.

235
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:03,898
This is for you.

236
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,001
Have a good night.

237
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:15,043
Franklin Pierce room.
Up the stairs, first door to the right.

238
00:20:41,271 --> 00:20:44,365
I was just over at the house.
Everything is gone.

239
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:48,208
- Which house are you referring to?
- The spec house.

240
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:51,339
The PVC,
the shake-roof shingles,

241
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:54,009
even that expensive
lock on the shed is missing.

242
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:56,076
That's awful, Mel.

243
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,951
You don't know
anything about this?

244
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,751
You left it there
to rot.

245
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:04,124
I don't believe this.

246
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:07,961
- With my husband on his deathbed...
- Oh, Sarah Bernhardt.

247
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:11,399
...you went over there and you picked
through the place like a vulture!

248
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:13,960
You said you'd straighten out the
permits with the building department

249
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:16,837
- and you never did.
- That is beside the point!

250
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:18,739
Carmela, what happened
to my bundt pan?

251
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:21,643
It was your fault the permits
were denied in the first place.

252
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:24,875
You're a broken record, for God's sake.
That's what you are.

253
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,644
Carmela, wait.

254
00:21:26,683 --> 00:21:31,211
No, let her go.
I've had a lifetime of her bullshit.

255
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:44,231
Gimme a coffee.

256
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,740
National directory.
City and state?

257
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:57,804
Peterborough,
New Hampshire.

258
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:00,373
The number
for Angelo Di Piazza.

259
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:04,183
- Double "Z."
- No number listed, sir.

260
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:06,189
How about
Roberta Di Piazza?

261
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:08,350
Nothing for
Roberta Di Piazza.

262
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:10,519
- Huh?
- Nothing, sir.

263
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:13,462
Could you try
Roberta Spatafore?

264
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:16,625
S-p-a-t-a-f-o-r-e.

265
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:19,761
I don't have anything
for that listing, sir.

266
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:22,135
Look, I'm trying
to find my cousin.

267
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:23,833
Could you search
the whole state?

268
00:22:23,874 --> 00:22:25,865
Searching.

269
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:28,002
I'm sorry, sir.

270
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:43,085
- What's good?
- First time here, try the johnnycakes.

271
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:45,993
What's that?

272
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:49,021
Pancake made with white cornmeal.
New England specialty.

273
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:50,897
Where you from?

274
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,637
Scottsdale.

275
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:58,266
Well, they're delicious.
Little butter, local syrup.

276
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:02,176
Okay, and gimme some
of them Jimmy Deans.

277
00:23:02,212 --> 00:23:05,511
Our sausages are
made in-house.

278
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:17,320
Hey, boys, how'd you guys
make out in the storm?

279
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:19,625
We lost our lights
in the middle of "Cold Case."

280
00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:23,656
We thought we were gonna have to talk
to each other or read a book.

281
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,668
The usual, guys?

282
00:23:25,702 --> 00:23:28,933
- Are we boring?
- Yeah yeah.

283
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:38,481
Here's your johnnycakes.

284
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:41,541
I gotta warn you,
they're addictive.

285
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:43,576
They look good.

286
00:23:58,402 --> 00:24:01,701
- You want more coffee?
- No, I'm coffeed out.

287
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:06,008
You don't say hello
to your uncle?

288
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:08,739
- Hi, Uncle Sil.
- Vito.

289
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:15,113
Well, he ain't
gonna show.

290
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:17,120
I'll just
leave him these.

291
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:21,147
He said he'd be back
from Vegas today. I don't know.

292
00:24:25,462 --> 00:24:27,896
You and Vito,

293
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:29,796
how are things going
with you guys?

294
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,427
We have our ups
and downs.

295
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:36,929
And in the romance
department?

296
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:40,205
Excuse me?

297
00:24:40,243 --> 00:24:43,076
What's this all about?

298
00:24:43,113 --> 00:24:46,549
It's awkward.

299
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:49,984
No offense, I really don't want
to talk about this.

300
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:55,154
Vito's a good father
and a loving husband.

301
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:57,786
But his mind
is elsewhere.

302
00:24:57,828 --> 00:25:01,594
He takes these
unexplained powders.

303
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:04,623
He's got a goomar.
I know all about it.

304
00:25:07,037 --> 00:25:09,665
It's nothing.
Forget about it.

305
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:13,476
You hear from him,

306
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,276
tell him I brought him
some Blood, Sweat and Tears tickets.

307
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,941
Backstage passes too.

308
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,167
I'm telling you,

309
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:40,726
my business,
I'm around a lot of women.

310
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:43,365
That one ain't
getting laid.

311
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,523
- Hello.
- Vito?

312
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,221
- You got him?
- Who?

313
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:08,993
- Put Vito on the phone, asshole.
- Fuck you, motherfucker.

314
00:26:09,032 --> 00:26:11,057
What, are you sucking his dick?
Put him on.

315
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:13,228
How about I kick
your ass, you fucking faggot?

316
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,671
Yeah, that's right, telephone tough-guy.
Put Vito on the phone!

317
00:26:16,706 --> 00:26:19,834
There ain't no Vito, man. I found
the phone on the side of the road.

318
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:22,470
- What?
- Hang on a second.

319
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:28,483
Where'd you find the phone?

320
00:26:28,518 --> 00:26:30,884
Hello.

321
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:32,912
Hello!

322
00:26:32,956 --> 00:26:35,447
Oh, you motherfucker.

323
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:37,426
What happened?

324
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:39,722
Bob at the marina
where Tony docks his boat

325
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:42,288
says he'll donate
a sunset dinner cruise.

326
00:26:42,332 --> 00:26:44,232
- I paid $300 for that?
- Yeah.

327
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:46,792
I got seasick in Bermuda
on one of those.

328
00:26:46,837 --> 00:26:48,998
- Oh, Angie, finally.
- Sorry.

329
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,734
I had these sales reps
in my office.

330
00:26:50,774 --> 00:26:53,242
We're just going over
the list for the silent auction.

331
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:57,076
- We're already up to about 7500 bucks.
- Oh good, Artie.

332
00:26:57,114 --> 00:26:59,981
- Ladies.
- A silent auction again?

333
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:03,850
- Why not get a live auctioneer?
- I got sea bream, beautiful.

334
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:06,048
Porcini-dusted ravioli,
huh?

335
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:08,455
I hate to be a pain,
but I gotta get back.

336
00:27:08,492 --> 00:27:10,460
- Can we just let him cook?
- Sure.

337
00:27:10,494 --> 00:27:12,655
Great, go for it.

338
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:15,824
Where were we?

339
00:27:15,866 --> 00:27:18,767
Jesus Christ.
He's always interrupting.

340
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:20,963
People enjoy
the silent auction.

341
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:22,938
I thought our goal
was to raise money.

342
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:26,670
I say we get 'em liquored up, let 'em
tear each other's throats out.

343
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:30,504
- Well...
- It's just an idea.

344
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:34,381
Anyhow, put me down for $2,000
worth of bodywork and/or paint.

345
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:36,578
2,000? Madonn', Ange.

346
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,750
So, did you hear about
Vito and Marie? Separated.

347
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,384
Oh, sorry, I gotta take this.

348
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:46,122
Hello?

349
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:48,063
They were just at the wedding.
They seemed fine.

350
00:27:48,098 --> 00:27:50,589
What'd I tell you?
Is that a beautiful fish or what?

351
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:52,795
Oh, for God's sake,
all right!

352
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:55,737
Can I just get some
prosciutto melon to go?

353
00:27:55,772 --> 00:27:57,967
I'm sorry, guys.
I gotta get back.

354
00:27:58,008 --> 00:28:02,945
No, the quarter panel
from the LeSabre, I said.

355
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:05,379
Oh shit.

356
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:07,280
You didn't know
he was gay?

357
00:28:11,922 --> 00:28:14,982
Actually I had him pegged
the whole time, but...

358
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:18,694
He a close friend?

359
00:28:18,728 --> 00:28:20,992
Not only that, he's one
of my most valuable guys.

360
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:23,465
He's ambitious,
he's focused.

361
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:26,168
When I was in
the hospital,

362
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:29,468
he helped Carmela
tremendously when we were strapped.

363
00:28:29,506 --> 00:28:33,670
You've implied you have
millions of dollars.

364
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,043
Your hospital stay
was actually that costly?

365
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,516
Well no, but, uh...

366
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,144
Huh?

367
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:45,552
Is that the issue?

368
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:49,320
You tell me.
What is the issue?

369
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,157
He's a fa-ag!

370
00:28:52,195 --> 00:28:53,958
And?

371
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:55,624
Now what am I
supposed to do?

372
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:57,656
About what?

373
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:59,692
I know what.
They're born that way, right?

374
00:28:59,736 --> 00:29:02,569
It's not their fault.

375
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:05,632
Frankly I think they
go about in pity for themselves.

376
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:09,008
I don't think they
see it as a fault.

377
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:11,343
In your circle I'm sure
you got all kinds

378
00:29:11,381 --> 00:29:14,714
of gays
and trans-whatevers

379
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:16,378
of all stripes.

380
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:18,478
But not where
I come from.

381
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:22,990
You personally...

382
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:26,086
how do you feel
about homosexuality?

383
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:28,461
I find it disgusting.

384
00:29:28,498 --> 00:29:32,594
Men kissing men,
holding hands in the street.

385
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:37,596
Every fuckin' TV show now,
they rub your nose in it.

386
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:41,206
Although, that...

387
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:43,974
the lesbian thing
with the, uh...

388
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:46,346
Jennifer Beals,

389
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:48,544
it's not bad.

390
00:29:50,153 --> 00:29:52,246
She a dyke in real life?

391
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,485
I don't give
too much of a shit

392
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:57,288
what people do
behind closed doors

393
00:29:57,327 --> 00:30:00,421
with the consenting
adults.

394
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:04,524
Although don't forget:
I'm a strict Catholic.

395
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:07,695
I agree with that
Senator Sanitorium,

396
00:30:07,737 --> 00:30:10,262
who says if we let
this stuff go too far,

397
00:30:10,307 --> 00:30:12,639
pretty soon we'll
be fucking dogs.

398
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:14,541
I hear a lot
of ambivalence.

399
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:20,982
This guy that
got outed, look,

400
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:23,417
the guys that work for me
are asking for head.

401
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:27,389
His head.
What the fuck?

402
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:32,324
You know, him and me,
we're in the construction business.

403
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:35,593
Now some of these
union old-timers, the contractors,

404
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:38,396
they're not gonna want
to be seen with him.

405
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:41,632
And I'm talking huge deals,
major fucking dollars.

406
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,670
A lot of your circle
must have done jail time.

407
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:52,444
They can't be strangers
to male-male sexual contact.

408
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:57,785
You get a pass for that.

409
00:30:59,255 --> 00:31:01,314
Well, that's nice.

410
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,521
Well, what are
you gonna do?

411
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:06,859
There's no women there.

412
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:10,696
You're there
five, 10 years.

413
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:18,201
Just for the record, my incarceration
was very short term,

414
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:20,471
so I never had any need
for any anal... you know.

415
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,139
So this fellow who's been outed,
what's he saying?

416
00:31:27,183 --> 00:31:30,118
You think I'm lying,
don't you?

417
00:31:30,153 --> 00:31:32,713
About when
I was in jail.

418
00:31:32,756 --> 00:31:36,192
I've given you no indication
I think you're lying.

419
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:49,436
What the fuck, I suppose
something inside me says

420
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:52,669
God bless, a' salut'.

421
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:55,109
Who gives a shit?

422
00:31:57,747 --> 00:32:01,148
I mean I had a second chance.
Why shouldn't he?

423
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:03,652
Part of your new outlook?

424
00:32:03,686 --> 00:32:06,382
Maybe.

425
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,551
I salute it, then.

426
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:12,886
Tall fuckin' order,
I'll tell you that.

427
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:14,556
How so?

428
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:18,795
You can talk about every day being
a gift and stopping to smell the roses,

429
00:32:18,835 --> 00:32:22,999
but regular life's got a way
of picking away at it.

430
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,906
Your house,
the shit you own,

431
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:28,001
it drags you down.

432
00:32:28,044 --> 00:32:30,308
Your kids,
what they want.

433
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:33,338
One bad idea
after another.

434
00:32:35,318 --> 00:32:38,913
Just trying to work a cell phone menu
is enough to make you scream.

435
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,092
There's some cold pasta.

436
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:47,062
No, I ate already.

437
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:48,961
What's all that?

438
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:52,901
For the silent auction.

439
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:54,927
My busy little beaver.

440
00:32:54,971 --> 00:32:57,735
Not really.

441
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:02,875
Look, Ton', I haven't
wanted to bug you,

442
00:33:02,912 --> 00:33:05,107
but before you
got hurt,

443
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:07,343
you said you would get
that building inspector

444
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:09,908
to cut me some slack
so I could get back to my business?

445
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:13,116
Oh yeah, right right.
I will, later.

446
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:16,853
Come here.

447
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:21,660
No, uh, I'm still not
ready for that.

448
00:33:21,698 --> 00:33:25,759
Last time I thought I tore something
from tensing my muscles.

449
00:33:28,204 --> 00:33:30,172
No, I got something
for that scar.

451
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:48,850
Vitamin E.

452
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:51,952
My facialist said
it will help get the red out.

453
00:33:57,534 --> 00:34:00,367
You were right
about my uncle, Carm.

454
00:34:00,403 --> 00:34:03,930
All along.

455
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:07,465
It doesn't give me
any pleasure, believe me.

456
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,344
I should have cut him
out of my life.

457
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:14,578
I brought this
all on myself.

458
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:18,917
You did not.
Don't ever think that.

459
00:34:21,558 --> 00:34:26,518
All this, you never once
said "I told you so."

460
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,896
Accentuate the positive.

461
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:37,801
I wanted you
to get better.

462
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:44,941
You know my shrink...

463
00:34:44,981 --> 00:34:49,384
told me that, uh...

464
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:53,788
I stood by Junior through
all his jealousy and shit...

465
00:34:56,693 --> 00:35:01,323
trying to prove
I'm a good guy...

466
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:07,796
and that my mother couldn't
hate a good boy like that.

467
00:35:12,175 --> 00:35:14,609
Imagine laying
next to a guy 15 years

468
00:35:14,644 --> 00:35:17,169
and all the time he's been playing for
the pink team.

469
00:35:17,213 --> 00:35:19,841
Who told you?
Tony swore me to secrecy.

470
00:35:19,882 --> 00:35:21,315
I'm not gonna
burn my sources.

471
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:23,319
Anyway, it's all over
the place.

472
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:28,052
Those children, imagine when they
find out their father's a finook.

473
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:30,719
God, she's such a bright girl,
Marie Spatafore.

474
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,819
You think she and Vito
had some arrangement?

475
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:34,762
I just hope she
gets herself tested.

476
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:40,891
Still, Vito? He'd be like the last
one you'd suspect.

477
00:35:40,937 --> 00:35:43,872
Suspect of what?

478
00:35:43,906 --> 00:35:46,500
Wow, such a young lady!

479
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:48,237
Yes, she's working
two jobs.

480
00:35:48,277 --> 00:35:52,043
Days she's interning at Gendler,
Lookstein, Abruzzo & Abruzzo.

481
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:53,946
What about Vito?

482
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:57,714
Nothing. Him and Marie
are having some problems, that's all.

483
00:35:59,455 --> 00:36:03,221
- I can probably guess.
- Excuse me?

484
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:05,693
Huh-uh, I'm not
going first.

485
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:07,593
Do you know
something?

486
00:36:13,202 --> 00:36:15,397
Okay...

487
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:19,374
he is possibly...

488
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,172
gay.

489
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,235
Finn saw him giving
some guy a blowjob.

490
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:26,013
What?

491
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:27,710
When Dad got him that job
in construction?

492
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,741
Finn showed up early
one morning and he saw Vito

493
00:36:29,786 --> 00:36:31,811
in a car going down on some
security guard.

494
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:34,755
- Oh my God!
- He saw this?

495
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:36,986
He had Finn all freaked out.
He still does.

496
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:38,618
Why didn't you
say something?

497
00:36:38,661 --> 00:36:41,528
Because Vito
warned Finn not to.

498
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:47,835
You gotta hear
what Meadow just told us.

499
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,895
- Mom!
- The cat's out of the bag, Meadow.

500
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,606
Oh, it's "Dr. Yank 'em,"
the painless dentist.

501
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:01,344
How you doing, kid?
Hey Ton'.

502
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:03,818
Hey...

503
00:37:05,922 --> 00:37:08,254
Unfortunately, Finn here
has got some bad news,

504
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:10,589
so, uh, listen up.

505
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:12,355
Sit down.

506
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:15,489
Go ahead.

507
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:17,192
Tell 'em
what you saw.

508
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:26,703
Don't be scared.
It's all right.

509
00:37:45,995 --> 00:37:48,190
All right, if we can just
head over and have lunch.

510
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:49,630
Good morning.

511
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,210
Good morning.

512
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:35,971
Let me ask you
a question.

513
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:38,810
Before he cornered you
in the porta-potty,

514
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,442
when the security guard
was sucking him off...

515
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:43,918
Whoa one sec, it was
the other way around.

516
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:46,251
What?

517
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:50,555
Vito was blowing
the security guard.

518
00:38:50,593 --> 00:38:53,153
Son of a bitch!

519
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:56,290
Catchin', not pitchin'?

520
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,937
He's not gonna know
I told you?

521
00:39:01,971 --> 00:39:05,031
You ain't gonna have
no problem from Vito, believe me.

522
00:39:05,074 --> 00:39:08,441
- What are you gonna do?
- It'll be okay.

523
00:39:08,477 --> 00:39:10,877
Get him to pay
for some therapy.

524
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:14,644
Look, why don't you...
why don't you go out front,

525
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:17,118
get yourself a sandwich,

526
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:18,677
any kind you like, huh?

527
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:21,212
Soda.

528
00:39:21,257 --> 00:39:24,658
When we're done here,
somebody will take you back.

529
00:39:26,662 --> 00:39:29,028
All right.

530
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:38,574
I wanna kill
the fat faggot myself.

531
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:40,075
Be a fuckin' honor.

532
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:43,567
Cut off his pisciatil'
and feed it to him.

533
00:39:43,613 --> 00:39:45,342
There can be
no mistake now.

534
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:47,008
I can't believe
I stuck up for him!

535
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:49,074
I feel like I've been
stabbed in the heart.

536
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:51,279
We can't have him here
in our social club no more.

537
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,787
I mean, that much
I do know.

538
00:39:52,822 --> 00:39:54,517
Social club?

539
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:55,990
He's gotta go!

540
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:58,459
I wanna think about it.

541
00:39:58,494 --> 00:40:01,088
Yeah, I don't know.

542
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,860
What the fuck?
What is there to think about?

543
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,767
- Sit down.
- Fuck that! I'll say it again!

544
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:08,531
What the fuck is there
to think about?

545
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:11,836
You gonna take care
of his kids, huh, after he's gone?

546
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,275
It's true.
They didn't do nothing.

547
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:19,406
Poor little guys.

548
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,710
Now sit down.

549
00:40:28,758 --> 00:40:32,159
I'm sorry if I yelled, T.
It's just...

550
00:40:32,194 --> 00:40:34,424
how much more
betrayal can I take?

551
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:39,895
Vito, a fag.

552
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,404
Big construction tycoon.

553
00:40:42,438 --> 00:40:46,534
Ton', when he was always talking
about "greasing the union,"

554
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:48,042
who knew that's
what he meant?

555
00:40:52,248 --> 00:40:54,944
All right, this stays
in these four walls.

556
00:40:56,352 --> 00:40:58,411
Am I understood?

557
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:06,622
- Phil, oh my God.
- You poor kid.

558
00:41:06,662 --> 00:41:10,189
I know. I can't
believe it myself.

559
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:13,633
I keep waiting
for him to call.

560
00:41:13,669 --> 00:41:16,433
How long am I supposed
to tell the kids he's away on business?

561
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:19,066
That fuckin' shitbag.
I get my hands on him

562
00:41:19,108 --> 00:41:20,700
I'm gonna tear him
limb from limb.

563
00:41:20,743 --> 00:41:23,837
- Oh, Phil, don't say that.
- You're my cousin he married,

564
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:26,643
making a mockery
of the whole sacrament.

565
00:41:27,984 --> 00:41:30,316
But what do we
really know?

566
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:33,481
I mean, maybe there
were signs, but...

567
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:38,590
Vito Spatafore
is a good man,

568
00:41:38,627 --> 00:41:40,288
and he's
a wonderful dad.

569
00:41:42,298 --> 00:41:46,257
Somebody sees something one time
and he's tossed aside like garbage?

570
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:50,667
That's why
I'm here, honey.

571
00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:53,106
There's been confirmation
through the grapevine.

572
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:56,839
Vito was seen
in a car with a man.

573
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,171
I don't want to get
graphic beyond that,

574
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:02,343
the idea of it
repulses me so much.

575
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:05,317
What confirmation?
Who?

576
00:42:05,354 --> 00:42:07,379
The witness has
no reason to lie.

577
00:42:07,423 --> 00:42:09,391
No...

578
00:42:09,425 --> 00:42:13,327
We can't be in denial
no more, much as we love him.

579
00:42:16,632 --> 00:42:19,123
Where do you think
he might have gone, honey?

580
00:42:19,168 --> 00:42:22,865
So we can get him back here,
get him to do something about it.

581
00:42:31,714 --> 00:42:33,909
Excuse me, Angie here?

582
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:35,644
In the office.

583
00:42:35,684 --> 00:42:38,118
We can get you anything
you want, sweetheart,

584
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:39,917
air bags,
chrome rims...

585
00:42:39,955 --> 00:42:42,753
- Oh, hi.
- Carm, hi.

586
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:44,953
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

587
00:42:44,994 --> 00:42:49,328
I'm here for the free
bodywork certificates for the auction.

588
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:52,129
- Oh, that's right.
- But if you're busy...

589
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:55,103
This'll just take
another sec.

590
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:57,401
Okay, sure.

591
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:10,010
They were doing something
behind closed doors.

592
00:43:10,052 --> 00:43:12,282
Well you know Angie's
put money on the street.

593
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:14,585
How do you know?

594
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:17,319
- Angie told me.
- She didn't tell me.

595
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,758
Probably 'cause of Tony.

596
00:43:18,794 --> 00:43:21,024
Aw, maybe he didn't want you
to know something like that.

597
00:43:21,063 --> 00:43:23,896
Me and my big mouth.

598
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:27,695
She's got enough money
to do that, huh?

599
00:43:31,907 --> 00:43:35,673
Well, she's pretty successful with that
body shop, so...

600
00:43:37,213 --> 00:43:38,703
Our grandmothers did it.

601
00:43:38,747 --> 00:43:43,616
Those were harder times,
but... a' salut', right?

602
00:43:43,652 --> 00:43:47,713
She's one of us.
Now it's like she's one of them.

603
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:53,061
- You wanted to see me, Ton'?
- Yeah.

604
00:43:53,095 --> 00:43:55,325
Hey, Carlo.

605
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,692
Sit down.

606
00:44:01,937 --> 00:44:05,270
Putting you in charge of
all construction business,

607
00:44:05,307 --> 00:44:07,138
replacing Vito.

608
00:44:07,176 --> 00:44:08,973
Holy shit!

609
00:44:09,011 --> 00:44:11,309
Guys respect you
across the board,

610
00:44:11,347 --> 00:44:13,713
you done real good
real with the ports...

611
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:16,681
Thank you, Ton'.

612
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,379
Jeez, I don't know
what to say.

613
00:44:20,422 --> 00:44:22,287
We'll have a drink.

614
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:24,759
Congratulations.

615
00:44:24,793 --> 00:44:26,488
A' salut,
a' salut.

616
00:44:33,335 --> 00:44:36,270
Listen, Ton'...

617
00:44:36,305 --> 00:44:39,797
since you think enough of me
to give me this responsibility

618
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:41,969
I might as well be
the one to say it.

619
00:44:42,011 --> 00:44:44,707
All right,
skip the preambles.

620
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:47,748
The guys on Vito's crew,

621
00:44:47,783 --> 00:44:49,774
they say if he
was to come back,

622
00:44:49,818 --> 00:44:51,547
they refuse to take
orders from him.

623
00:44:51,587 --> 00:44:54,249
Oh, they do?

624
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,521
Not only that,

625
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,858
a couple of the other captains
won't talk to him,

626
00:44:59,895 --> 00:45:03,331
and I don't disagree.

627
00:45:03,365 --> 00:45:05,595
Paulie especially.

628
00:45:05,634 --> 00:45:08,034
Now that he's
accepted it, hey...

629
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,470
he's the most out
for Vito's scalp.

630
00:45:10,506 --> 00:45:15,307
Yeah, you should hear him, Ton'. He's
goin' fuckin' mau-mau on the subject.

631
00:45:17,246 --> 00:45:20,010
It's not their fucking decision
who they work with.

632
00:45:21,517 --> 00:45:22,984
Let me tell
you something...

633
00:45:23,018 --> 00:45:26,044
fuckin' Vito,
through sheer hard work,

634
00:45:26,088 --> 00:45:27,783
turned himself
into my best earner.

635
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:31,350
I don't even know
if I'd have the new boat without him.

636
00:45:31,393 --> 00:45:33,725
He's a come-from-behind
kind of guy.

637
00:45:33,762 --> 00:45:35,855
That's true, but...

638
00:45:35,898 --> 00:45:38,958
So I'm gonna burn
that kind of dedication?

639
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:41,026
It's hard to believe I couldn't get
something more out of him,

640
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,867
if he were to come back.

641
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:46,136
Stocks, offshore shit,
I don't know.

642
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:49,804
Well...

643
00:45:49,845 --> 00:45:51,972
these other guys feel
an effort should be made

644
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:54,539
to find him and put him down
for the honor of the family.

645
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:57,108
Oh, please, huh?

646
00:45:57,152 --> 00:45:59,586
You know, certain people,
they love the high drama,

647
00:45:59,622 --> 00:46:02,819
like fuckin' high school girls.
And others I could name,

648
00:46:02,858 --> 00:46:05,691
they just can't wait to
whack somebody, anybody.

649
00:46:05,728 --> 00:46:09,994
But some people feel it's against
our principles, Tony.

650
00:46:10,032 --> 00:46:12,023
A sin.

651
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:17,931
Carlo, let's be honest
with ourselves here.

652
00:46:17,973 --> 00:46:19,804
We all know Vito's
not the first.

653
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:29,213
Well...

654
00:46:29,251 --> 00:46:32,311
we're gonna do
great things.

655
00:46:32,354 --> 00:46:36,120
Aw, Jesus, thanks again, Anthony.
Thank you.

656
00:47:08,724 --> 00:47:10,885
What?

657
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:15,254
It's 2006.

658
00:47:15,297 --> 00:47:19,666
There's pillow biters
in the Special Forces.

659
00:47:19,702 --> 00:47:23,433
Let me just
ask you, Ton'...

660
00:47:23,472 --> 00:47:26,270
sake of argument.

661
00:47:26,308 --> 00:47:28,936
Let's say he shows up.

662
00:47:28,977 --> 00:47:32,743
You gonna kiss this guy
on both cheeks?

663
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:36,913
Take Paulie, okay?

664
00:47:36,952 --> 00:47:39,284
You know perfectly well

665
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:44,224
guys like him never kick up their full
percent to you.

666
00:47:44,259 --> 00:47:46,352
You look the other way,

667
00:47:46,395 --> 00:47:49,831
price of doing
business.

668
00:47:49,865 --> 00:47:54,734
But you cut Vito slack now
that he's "out of the closet,"

669
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:58,467
just the excuse people need
to go off the reservation

670
00:47:58,507 --> 00:48:01,704
and start withholding
serious money.

671
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:07,707
Let me read
in peace, will you?

672
00:48:10,552 --> 00:48:12,486
Having fun
with all this paper?

673
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:14,819
I can't believe
this is just one case.

674
00:48:14,857 --> 00:48:17,451
Rafaella Martino.
I'm the lead attorney on this mess.

675
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:19,427
Meadow Soprano.

676
00:48:19,461 --> 00:48:21,759
- I'm Michael Kardish. I work with Rae.
- Hi.

677
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:23,662
Ms. Soprano came
highly recommended.

678
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:27,135
Columbia Dean's List, volunteer
at the South Bronx Law Center...

679
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:29,467
This is really
interesting too.

680
00:48:29,505 --> 00:48:32,599
Of course it's different than the kind
of thing we see at the law center.

681
00:48:32,641 --> 00:48:34,370
Clients there are so
trampled and abused...

682
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,401
Welcome to
white-collar fraud.

683
00:48:36,445 --> 00:48:39,573
I need the e-mails from box 44
and 45, July and August.

684
00:48:39,615 --> 00:48:41,708
Pull them and leave them
with my assistant.

685
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,741
Okay.

686
00:48:45,187 --> 00:48:47,712
Tony Soprano's kid.

687
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:00,528
Tony.

688
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:02,264
Building my
lats back up.

689
00:49:02,304 --> 00:49:06,240
Did you by any chance talk to
the building inspector about my house?

690
00:49:06,275 --> 00:49:08,607
Shit, I forgot.

691
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:24,757
The sorting's tedious,
but some of the cases...

692
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:26,488
this guy was
pretty clever, really.

693
00:49:26,528 --> 00:49:28,723
He set up all these
phony investment firms

694
00:49:28,764 --> 00:49:30,493
and then just siphoned
the money out:

695
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:32,523
- $80 million.
- Whoa.

696
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:34,593
Yeah, he's out on bail.

697
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:38,167
Then you look at
my father's friend,

698
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:39,674
federal marshals
dragging him

699
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:41,335
out of his own
daughter's wedding.

700
00:49:41,376 --> 00:49:42,843
He hasn't even
been tried yet.

701
00:49:42,878 --> 00:49:45,438
You're innocent in this
country until proven guilty.

702
00:49:45,481 --> 00:49:47,915
Yeah, but Johnny Macaroni
was indicted for murder.

703
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:50,817
They couldn't let him
stay 15 more minutes?

704
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:55,122
You better put
your pants on.

705
00:49:58,093 --> 00:50:00,084
You know why
they did that?

706
00:50:00,128 --> 00:50:02,255
To humiliate him
in front of everyone.

707
00:50:02,297 --> 00:50:04,697
Metal detectors,
frisking,

708
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:06,325
my father
with the shoes?

709
00:50:06,368 --> 00:50:08,165
It was pure
harassment.

710
00:50:08,203 --> 00:50:10,501
Yeah, but the guy's lucky
they even let him out.

711
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:14,737
Oh, so white-collar criminals
can destroy people's lives

712
00:50:14,776 --> 00:50:17,939
and steal their pensions
and it's no big deal to you.

713
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,575
You know what?
Bad subject.

714
00:50:21,617 --> 00:50:23,175
Let's talk about
something else.

715
00:50:23,218 --> 00:50:25,015
No, let's talk about it

716
00:50:25,053 --> 00:50:27,044
so we can stop
with the "macaroni" cracks.

717
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:30,252
Weird, since you're
part Italian yourself.

718
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:32,522
Please, my dad
is so deracinated.

719
00:50:32,561 --> 00:50:35,155
Yeah, the way he prefers it.
All those hysterical jokes

720
00:50:35,197 --> 00:50:37,165
about Italian cheeses
and smelly feet.

721
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,724
Why are you
picking a fight?

722
00:50:39,768 --> 00:50:43,795
I'm not, but you're slamming my family.
I don't know.

723
00:50:46,742 --> 00:50:48,710
This is good shit.

724
00:50:48,744 --> 00:50:50,735
It's amazing.

725
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:57,580
You weren't there for
the "grand inquisition" about Vito.

726
00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:00,611
I knew it.
I'm picking the fight.

727
00:51:00,656 --> 00:51:03,284
I was in the back
of a butcher shop

728
00:51:03,325 --> 00:51:05,350
with your Uncle Paulie,

729
00:51:05,394 --> 00:51:08,557
ratting out a guy
I don't really even know.

730
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:11,930
I mean what do you think's
going to happen to Vito for being gay?

731
00:51:14,403 --> 00:51:17,998
And don't give me any of that "poverty
of the Mezzogiorno" bullshit.

732
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,031
We're in fucking
Caldwell, New Jersey,

733
00:51:20,075 --> 00:51:22,873
and you're on your
high horse about justice?

734
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:26,347
They are gonna
mete it out themselves.

735
00:51:29,051 --> 00:51:30,746
This is untenable.

736
00:52:30,379 --> 00:52:34,315
This is nice,
this pot.

737
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:38,581
Yeah, that's a Baneda,
Arts and Crafts Movement.

738
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:42,852
Yeah? I really don't know
much about this stuff.

739
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:44,358
Well, you've got
a good eye.

740
00:52:44,393 --> 00:52:47,487
That's the most
expensive piece in the store.

741
00:52:47,529 --> 00:52:50,464
You're a natural.
