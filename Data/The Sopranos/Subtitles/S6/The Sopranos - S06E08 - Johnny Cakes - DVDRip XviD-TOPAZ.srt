1
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:42,232
Are you all right?

2
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:44,098
Yeah!

3
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:46,126
Keep going!

4
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,819
Are you sure
you're all right?

5
00:02:02,854 --> 00:02:05,084
The incision?

6
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,157
You're listening
to the stations

7
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:12,186
of member-supported
New Hampshire Public Radio.

8
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,596
We're WEBO, Concord 89.1;

9
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:18,433
WEBJ, Jackson 99.5 F.M.

10
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,563
This is New Hampshire
Public Radio,

11
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:24,200
news and information
for the Granite State.

12
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,745
It's nice
having this again.

13
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:42,651
Well, it's supposed
to be better than "nice."

14
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:44,753
You know what I mean.

15
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:48,323
After that nightmare,
God, we are blessed, Tony.

16
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:50,334
Yeah.

17
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:01,379
AJ's practicing?

18
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:04,541
That's a first.

19
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:12,255
I'll let you know.

20
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:18,157
- All right.
- All right, thanks, man.

21
00:03:20,665 --> 00:03:23,361
Your amigos
with the baggy pants,

22
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:25,369
hope you kept 'em
away from the silver.

23
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:27,564
Oh, Jesus,
they're musicians, all right?

24
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:30,005
They saw an ad
for the drums.

25
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,009
You're selling
your drums?

26
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:34,375
I need cash.
I don't play 'em anymore.

27
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:36,710
Those drums were a gift
from your father.

28
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:38,545
Yeah, I don't
wanna sell 'em.

29
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,881
And if you guys hadn't made me
get such a crappy job,

30
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,046
- I wouldn't have to.
- This is our fault?

31
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:45,215
I'm wasting my time
at Blockbuster.

32
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:47,486
Why don't you get off your ass
and find another job?

33
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:50,619
What about community college? You said
you were gonna go back to school.

34
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:52,857
Okay, for the
hundredth time:

35
00:03:52,897 --> 00:03:56,833
I can't register
until second semester!

36
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:59,302
Jesus Christ!

37
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:00,804
I do what you
guys want,

38
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:03,034
don't I deserve
some kind of life?

39
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:10,680
Please, move back!
Move back!

40
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:29,396
Jim, we need a crew
on the roof to ventilate. Let's go!

41
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:31,664
I can't find Gareth.
I think he's still in the house.

42
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:33,568
Son of a bitch.
We'll get him.

43
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:36,733
- Oh God, Gareth!
- We'll get him, Sarah. We'll get him.

44
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:41,144
- It'll be all right, Sarah.
- Come on, guys, go go go!

45
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:43,579
Hurry up!
Come on.

46
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:46,550
- Look, look!
- That window!

48
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:52,479
I got her kid.

50
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:10,431
You want another one?

51
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:12,500
Yeah, sure.

52
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:39,034
So Uncle Jun',

53
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:42,602
what are we gonna do
about him?

54
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:49,010
He's incarcerated
for the rest of his unnatural life.

55
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:50,947
So fuck him.

56
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:52,210
He's a walking corpse.

57
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,480
Yeah, but, Dad,
what he did to you...

58
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,716
Certainly nothing
for you to worry about.

59
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:45,359
"Manager Dale."
Welcome to the neighborhood.

60
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:48,372
We're from the North Ward
Merchants Protective Cooperative.

61
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:50,374
I'm kinda busy.
You guys looking for a donation?

62
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:52,899
- Let him finish.
- You may have noticed,

63
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:55,742
not to denigrate anyone,
but this is a transitional neighborhood.

64
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,147
I mean, demographically speaking,
you still have a lot of marginal types.

65
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:02,016
We merchants have found
you really should

66
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:04,419
have some round-the-clock
security here.

67
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:07,253
- Isn't that what the police are for?
- They do their best,

68
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:08,987
but they got
their hands full.

69
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:11,495
Your weekly dues to us will give you
all the supplemental

70
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:14,589
- safety net you'll ever need.
- I can't authorize anything like that.

71
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:16,725
It have to go through
Corporate in Seattle.

72
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:20,761
We merchants prefer
to deal on a personal one-on-one basis.

73
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:22,830
I don't have any
discretionary funds.

74
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,501
It's gotta go
through Corporate.

75
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:26,737
How do you think Corporate
would feel if,

76
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:30,145
for the sake of argument, someone threw
a brick through your window?

77
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:32,342
They've got 10,000 stores
in North America.

78
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:34,146
I don't think
they'd feel anything.

79
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:37,746
What if, God forbid,
it wasn't just vandalism?

80
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:40,053
What if an employee,

81
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,719
even the manager say,
was assaulted?

82
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:49,762
Look, every last
fucking coffee bean

83
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:52,201
is in the computer
and has to be accounted for.

84
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:56,536
The numbers don't add up, I'll be gone
and somebody else will be here.

85
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:08,679
It's over
for the little guy.

86
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:13,816
Vince, good morning.
How's your book coming?

87
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,792
Okay.

88
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:19,092
As I told you you're always welcome
to join the other guests for breakfast.

89
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,860
Thad says if your dishwasher
is newer than five years,

90
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:23,890
you don't need to use
the pre-rinse cycle.

91
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:26,563
The fact is I don't recommend it.
It can trick the sensors

92
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:29,835
into thinking that the dishes
are cleaner than they really are.

93
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:32,775
I gotta go write.
Thanks.

94
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:37,806
Morning.

95
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:54,661
Jason Masucci was down in Tampa
visiting his mother,

96
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:58,100
thought he saw Vito
in a Jenny Craig.

97
00:08:58,136 --> 00:09:00,730
Turned out to be
some other fat piece of shit.

98
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:02,865
If that fag ever
does come back,

99
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:05,467
we should have
Carlo do it.

100
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,034
Be good
with all the crews.

101
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:10,172
Excuse me?
You were all hot to trot.

102
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:13,445
I got enough complications
in my life.

103
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:15,452
Feds up my ass.

104
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,454
For business reasons,
okay,

105
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:19,615
but for political
correctness?

106
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:22,524
Check it out.

107
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,586
I could do that,
no problem.

108
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,427
Wait here.
I'll get your Viagra.

109
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:30,923
Let me tell you something,
for two months after the shooting,

110
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:32,959
as far as snatch
was concerned,

111
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:35,438
didn't even have a hard-on
when I woke up in the morning.

112
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:37,304
Like Sil.

113
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:39,104
Bullet didn't fuck
with the plumbing though.

114
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:41,043
No no, thank God.

115
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:43,206
It's just the effects
of the physical trauma.

116
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:45,477
Doc said it was part
of the healing process.

117
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:47,984
I must be healed now
because I got a baguette

118
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,146
in my pants now 24/7.

119
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:52,656
Affirmation of life.

120
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,182
Hey, she's coming
this way.

121
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:00,092
Put money in the meter
or something.

122
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:03,658
Anthony Soprano.

123
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:06,067
- Yeah.
- Julianna Skiff,

124
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:08,834
Century 21.
You got a minute?

125
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:10,841
Sure.

126
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,469
Cannoli?

127
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:15,775
No, thank you.

128
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:18,839
You own the building at 217 Franklin,
right around the corner,

129
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:21,408
currently occupied
by Caputo Live Poultry.

130
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:23,283
I represent
the Jamba Juice Company.

131
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:25,619
They're interested
in purchasing the property.

132
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:27,647
Jamba Juice...

133
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:29,853
wants to put a store
in around here?

134
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:32,522
Well, you must have
noticed the area's on an upswing.

135
00:10:32,563 --> 00:10:34,758
You know the old glove factory
across the park,

136
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,097
over by the cathedral,
beautiful renovation.

137
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:39,103
I just bought
a loft there myself.

138
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:42,538
Person like yourself's a wonderful
addition to the neighborhood.

139
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,407
Jamba Juice is willing
to pay $175 a square foot.

140
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:52,575
Public records show
the building at 1,800 square feet.

141
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:56,018
So that makes
a purchase price of $315,000.

142
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:58,317
You ever buy eggs
from Caputo?

143
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:01,348
Frankly, I'm not wild
about the smell in there.

144
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:03,758
Let me tell you, his eggs
taste 10 times better

145
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:07,286
than any of the ones you get
in the supermarket. Chickens too.

146
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:09,629
Businesses relocate
all the time.

147
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,966
No, this would be a real loss
for the neighborhood.

148
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:15,029
Don't you live out
in North Caldwell?

149
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:17,563
Yeah, my family made
the trek up Guinea Gulch.

150
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:20,577
Bloomfield Avenue.

151
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:23,136
But my roots here
go way back.

152
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:25,274
My grandfather
came from Avellino

153
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:28,149
like most of the people around here,
and I grew up right over there.

154
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,586
My father was an early
community leader.

156
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:37,151
How about you?
Where're you from?

157
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,822
Upstate New York.

158
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:41,764
- Binghamton.
- How'd you wind up here?

159
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,257
My parents have
a catering business,

160
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:48,295
something to leave
to the kids, right?

161
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:51,706
Only I didn't see myself making
Salisbury steak for the next 30 years.

162
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:53,710
So I left home at 17.

163
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:57,236
- Rebellious.
- Just a low tolerance for boredom.

164
00:11:57,281 --> 00:12:01,684
So... interested,
not interested?

165
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:04,620
I'm interested.

166
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,623
But as far as
the property's concerned,

167
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:08,818
175 a square foot's
a little low.

168
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:13,527
And...

169
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:15,555
I don't wanna sell out
from under the guy.

170
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:28,009
Good morning, Vince.

171
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:30,206
The usual?

172
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:33,649
- Been dreaming of those johnnycakes.
- Can't beat Jim's johnnycakes.

173
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:35,777
I saw you at
the fire last night.

174
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,788
You got balls, my friend.

175
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:40,723
You don't get paid
for that, right?

176
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:42,783
We're all volunteers.

177
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:45,091
Back where I come from,
you join the fire department

178
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:47,097
to steal shit
from people's bedrooms.

179
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:49,929
- How's the book coming?
- It's fucking slow today.

180
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,366
Writer's block, huh?

181
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:53,461
Let's just say I like eating
a lot more than writing.

182
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:55,472
And you don't help any.

183
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:57,974
Everything you make
is fucking delicious.

184
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:00,534
You know...

185
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:02,739
I don't know
how you do it.

186
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,748
I can't even
write a letter.

187
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:08,240
You know I saw Graziano
fight Sugar Ray in 1952.

188
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:10,186
I took a train
to Chicago.

189
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:13,213
Maybe you should
interview me.

190
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:14,952
Maybe I will.

191
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:17,654
I thought you were writing a book
about Rocky Marciano.

192
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,428
Well, you can't talk about one
without the other.

193
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,264
Marciano...

194
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:27,601
now that was
a tragic death.

195
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:31,130
Now what was the year
he fought Joe Louis... '49?

196
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:32,472
Yeah.

197
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,308
Actually, I think
it was '51.

198
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:38,515
When you told me
you were writing a book,

199
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:40,483
I looked him up
on the Internet.

200
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:42,816
I don't know where
my fucking head is today.

201
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:45,686
Maybe you're working
too hard.

202
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:48,692
Yeah.

203
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:52,890
It must be lonely sometimes,
being a writer.

204
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,366
You get used to it.

205
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,561
Hey, Dad, I left
my science project in the back.

206
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:02,402
Don't lose
my glue gun.

207
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:11,481
Hey, Mrs. Conte.
Come sta'?

208
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:14,916
- How's the hip?
- Hey, Anthony. I need your help.

209
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:17,011
- What?
- Those nigger fucking whores,

210
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:19,022
they play that
music so loud.

211
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:22,492
Now that's not nice.
Those are Puerto Ricans, Mrs. Conte.

212
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:24,494
I ask 'em nice
to turn it down.

213
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:27,793
They tell me
to go fuck myself.

214
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:31,534
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.

215
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,196
Hey, how's Junior?

216
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:35,705
- Tell him I said hello.
- Yeah.

217
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:53,586
You know, I been
meaning to ask you,

218
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:56,616
chicken or the egg?
You wanna weigh in?

219
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,457
That same stupid joke,
huh?

220
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:01,522
- How are you?
- Good good.

221
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:03,362
So how's business?
Mezzo mezz'?

222
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:06,302
- Believe it or not, better than ever.
- Glad to hear it.

223
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:08,305
I'll have to raise
your rent.

224
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:16,871
See, when you hold
your knife with your blade

225
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:19,178
facing your opponent,
you got a lot better control.

226
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:20,945
Plus, you protect
the forearm.

227
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,613
No, if you got the tip pointing at him,
you get more distance.

228
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:25,645
You could swipe his abdomen
and fucking gut him.

229
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:28,624
See, that's stupid. Look how your range
of motion is limited.

230
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:31,321
It's so easy for him to step back,
grab your fucking arm,

231
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:34,024
- take your knife away.
- Could someone please check us out?

232
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:43,369
Yo, Hernan.

233
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,807
Sure, what time?

234
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:48,175
Cool.

235
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:50,180
No problem.
I can cover tonight.

236
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:53,775
I'm totally
fucking minted. Later.

237
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,809
Yeah?

238
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:58,083
I'm at work.
What do you think?

239
00:15:58,122 --> 00:16:02,081
He stepped on a nail?

240
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:03,593
Fuck.

241
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:06,960
How far did it
go in?

242
00:16:06,997 --> 00:16:09,124
- Fuck!
- Would you mind?

243
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,031
I better call
you back. Bye.

244
00:16:12,803 --> 00:16:15,465
That was Hernan?

245
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,009
He was such a dick
in high school.

246
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:21,375
Well, he was a senior.
What do you expect?

247
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:23,744
They always shit
on the underclassmen.

248
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:27,951
The kid spends
every night

249
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:30,112
in some fucking club
in New York,

250
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:33,146
sleeps till noon, puts in a couple
hours at Blockbuster

251
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,522
and that's it.

252
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:38,050
And since my injury,
like I told you,

253
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:40,791
I've been more,
you know...

254
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:43,959
accepting. Be grateful
for what you got.

255
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:48,301
But maybe that's wrong.
Maybe I should be on the kid.

256
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:51,831
My dad would have
kicked my lazy ass out of the house.

257
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:54,470
Really?

258
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:57,845
It's the chopping off
of the guy's finger, right?

259
00:16:57,882 --> 00:17:01,147
I never should have told you 'cause
that's all you fixate on with him.

260
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:04,882
Can you empathize
with AJ at that age?

261
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:08,414
Yeah, I had some
problems at school,

262
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,654
but I didn't vegetate.

263
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:14,095
- What?
- These are different times.

264
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:18,124
Young people today are bombarded
with so much information,

265
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:21,365
so much input
of every kind.

266
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:24,533
Consequently,
true adulthood

267
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:26,065
is delayed.

268
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,546
Sociologists say
that 26

269
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,208
is in fact
the new 21.

270
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:34,274
And the new 26
is what?

271
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:39,387
I'm 46, so that means
I'm what, 35?

272
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:45,294
My father isn't
an old man.

273
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:49,060
It's ridiculous to let himself
disintegrate like this.

274
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:55,328
How's it going
with patient Soprano?

275
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:01,976
- What?
- I'm talking about my father, Elliot.

276
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:04,640
- I thought you were done.
- It happens too often.

277
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:07,913
I think that's
a non-sequitur accusation.

278
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:10,853
Why don't you just
admit he's a gangster?

279
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:13,686
He was gunned down,
and you're into it

280
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:16,215
on a tabloid level.

281
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,559
You devoted quite a chunk
of last visit to him.

282
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:21,758
I'm responding to that.

283
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:24,324
Nothing's changed, okay?

284
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:28,429
He refuses to really engage
on this trauma the uncle caused.

285
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:30,406
And I think it's just
a matter of time

286
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:33,933
before he totally
decompensates.

287
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:38,005
Has he cried
or reported crying

288
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:41,108
at all about
this man Buster?

289
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:43,142
Junior, no.

291
00:18:46,757 --> 00:18:49,055
This omerta concept

292
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:52,460
comes from
a pre-therapeutic culture.

293
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:55,465
This isn't omerta.

294
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:58,024
It's something else.

295
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:20,815
Hey, man.
Park it in the garage

296
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:22,917
on 14th Street,
not the other shithole.

297
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,485
Watch for potholes.

298
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:27,429
What's going on, man?

299
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:29,989
How's it going?
Good to see you.

300
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:36,406
His dad's
really a gangster?

301
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,068
Capo di tutti capi.

302
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:41,077
What's that mean?

303
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:43,238
- How old are you?
- 20.

304
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,249
- Shut up.
- 15.

305
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:48,478
- How old are you?
- 18.

306
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:53,513
When I take E,
my feet get cold.

307
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:55,525
That ever happen
to you?

308
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,117
I wear special socks.

309
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:59,755
Let's go uptown
to my crib and get more twisted,

310
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:01,526
if that's possible.

311
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:05,057
- Oh, it's possible.
- I could give you a massage.

312
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:08,196
Yeah. Yeah, you could.

313
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:13,266
Oh, yeah, all right.

314
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,508
We all good?

315
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:22,542
Yeah, it's cool.

316
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:37,992
Mr. Soprano,
Zasu said to tell you

317
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:40,094
he's honored to
have you in the club.

318
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:44,699
And please,
regards to your dad.

319
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:47,074
Okay.

320
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:51,247
Oh, yeah, right.

321
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:59,482
What can I do
for you, Phil?

322
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:02,117
Vito.

323
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,593
Do we know
where he's at?

324
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:07,153
Well, that really
doesn't concern you.

325
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:08,892
How's John?

326
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:12,095
I don't know. Fine,
through his vale of tears.

327
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:14,127
But seriously,

328
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:16,901
Vito, what's being
done about him?

329
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,238
Like I just said, it's none of your
fucking business

330
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:22,074
- 'cause he works for me, not you.
- He's married to my cousin.

331
00:21:22,112 --> 00:21:24,444
He dishonored me
personally.

332
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:26,608
What do you want me to do,
put out an APB on the guy

333
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,584
'cause he takes it
up the ass, huh?

334
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:30,746
It's a victimless crime.

335
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:33,348
Marie is a victim.
Her children are victims.

336
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,483
They've done nothing.

337
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:37,517
And they're forced
to live with the shame

338
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:41,088
and humiliation.
I gotta be frank,

339
00:21:41,131 --> 00:21:42,894
in your father's day,

340
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:45,527
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

341
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:48,766
A finook in his crew,
he knew how to handle that.

342
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:52,207
I sympathize with Marie

343
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:54,233
and the children, okay?

344
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:57,873
But don't you fucking tell me what
to do. You're only acting boss.

345
00:21:57,915 --> 00:22:01,407
I swallowed my pride
when your murdering fuck of a cousin

346
00:22:01,451 --> 00:22:03,385
killed my brother.

347
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,149
Don't think I'm
gonna do it twice.

348
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:09,751
Phillip, let's not make a beef
where there isn't one.

349
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:12,455
Fundamentally,
we are in agreement

350
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:15,659
on this issue,
but I'll handle it.

351
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,972
You know, I saw you on TV
when your grandfather shot your dad.

352
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:25,872
And now we're
like friends.

353
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:28,901
- That's so weird.
- Right.

354
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:31,540
So what's gonna happen
to him, your grandfather, I mean?

355
00:22:31,582 --> 00:22:34,380
He's my great-uncle.

356
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:36,215
So isn't your dad
gonna do something?

357
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:38,016
You know, the "omerto"?

358
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:41,690
We don't talk about that
with outsiders.

359
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:43,852
Cool, but I mean,

360
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:46,419
he's not just gonna
let him get away with it, is he?

361
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:50,231
I'll probably
have to do something.

362
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:52,132
Really?

363
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,431
You're so intense.

364
00:22:57,274 --> 00:22:59,401
You probably left it
in the car, Thad.

365
00:22:59,443 --> 00:23:01,411
No, it was
on the bedside table.

366
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:04,346
- I was charging it.
- You're always losing something.

367
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:06,349
Last week it was
the sunglasses.

368
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:09,147
He left them on the counter
at the TCBY.

369
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:11,654
- What did you lose?
- Cell phone.

370
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:14,282
I didn't lose it.
I was charging the damn thing.

371
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:16,918
Tell you what I do,
try to retrace my steps.

372
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,953
It was
on the bedside table.

373
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:26,432
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

374
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,065
- Where are you? Who's Thad McCone?
- Some guy.

375
00:23:30,107 --> 00:23:33,474
- Oh, my God, Vito.
- Not that.

376
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,207
I'm just borrowing
his phone.

377
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:40,375
Listen, Marie,

378
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:43,147
I'm sorry all this
had to happen.

379
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:45,654
I never meant
to hurt you.

380
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:48,123
Come back, Vito.
Just come back.

381
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,719
It's a little more
complicated than that.

382
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:53,889
Please, Phil said
it'll be all right.

383
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:57,332
We could get you help.
We could get you psychiatric help.

384
00:23:57,367 --> 00:24:00,131
Phil? I trust him
least of all.

385
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,571
How can you say that?
He's family.

386
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:06,667
- He loves you.
- Not anymore, believe me.

387
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,701
But I've been
reading online,

388
00:24:08,745 --> 00:24:10,736
there are these
church groups.

389
00:24:10,781 --> 00:24:12,408
They could cure you
of this.

390
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:14,076
- Marie...
- Well, what are you gonna do,

391
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:15,641
never come home?

392
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:17,051
I'm working on that.

393
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:21,985
In the meantime,
you're gonna need some cash.

394
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:24,391
I need you, Vito.
I need my husband.

395
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:28,558
Listen to me, in the den behind
the elliptical trainer,

396
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:31,897
the baseboard
comes off.

397
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:34,733
There's 30K in there.

398
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:40,404
You know, Marie,

399
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:43,038
- you would like it here.
- Tell me where.

400
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,344
I'll bring the kids.
We'll relocate.

401
00:24:45,382 --> 00:24:47,213
I gotta go.

402
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,480
Don't you wanna talk
to Frannie or little V?

403
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:53,619
Yeah, okay.

404
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:55,318
Put 'em on.

405
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,226
Vito, your father's
on the phone.

406
00:24:58,261 --> 00:25:00,354
He wants to talk to you.

407
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:06,168
Hi, Dad.

408
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:09,900
Hey there, champ,
you been good?

409
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,908
You been behaving?

410
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:13,933
Yeah, you know...

411
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:19,508
- Dad?
- I gotta go.

412
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:24,877
You take care
of your mother, okay?

413
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:45,564
Mr. Soprano.

414
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:47,668
- Hey.
- Hi.

415
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:50,680
- Good news.
- How'd you know to find me here?

416
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:52,238
I'm a real estate agent.

418
00:25:55,085 --> 00:25:57,053
Can I buy you
a drink?

419
00:25:57,087 --> 00:26:00,682
Uh, sure.

420
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:02,715
Ginger ale with
lime juice, please.

421
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:05,921
Have a seat.

422
00:26:08,598 --> 00:26:10,566
Jamba Juice upped
their offer,

423
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,568
225 a square foot.

424
00:26:12,602 --> 00:26:15,264
I don't know.

425
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:17,205
How's this for an idea?

426
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,208
They let you
carry the note.

427
00:26:19,242 --> 00:26:21,210
You won't get hammered
on the taxes.

428
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:23,212
Well,
that's an incentive,

429
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:25,476
but the truth is
I don't wanna sell.

430
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:27,483
You're a businessman,
are you not?

431
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:29,485
As a businessman,
I gotta tell you

432
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,953
that in 10 years' time
that property's gonna

433
00:26:31,988 --> 00:26:34,752
be worth twice as much
as they're offering.

434
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:37,658
But, you know, it's not
just the money.

435
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:41,130
You drive around America today
and everything looks the fucking same,

436
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:44,395
Old Navy and Bed, Bath
and whatever.

437
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:47,801
But the North Ward,
it's the North Ward.

438
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:51,769
Plus, I got business
interests there, so...

439
00:26:51,808 --> 00:26:54,333
Something like all immigrant groups
love to gamble.

440
00:26:56,746 --> 00:26:59,510
Listen, why don't...

441
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:01,517
me and you go get
some dinner?

442
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:03,212
I have a boyfriend.

443
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:05,118
I'm engaged.

444
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:08,147
I have a wife.
I'm married.

445
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:10,489
It's... you know,
we're talking business.

446
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:13,519
You just said you don't wanna sell.
What's there to discuss?

447
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:16,361
Truth is I'm
very attracted to you.

448
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:21,300
Maybe you read in the papers
that I got shot.

449
00:27:21,338 --> 00:27:24,000
Well, Julianna,

450
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,977
that experience made
me appreciate life.

451
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:30,946
It's short. It could
end at any time,

452
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,779
and if you've got
the chance to do something

453
00:27:33,817 --> 00:27:36,149
that might make you happy,

454
00:27:36,186 --> 00:27:40,850
you should take it,

455
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:44,327
you know, like when
you left Binghamton.

456
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,195
You're very persuasive.

457
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:59,208
And in the past,
I might have jumped.

458
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:01,210
Like I said,
I'm engaged.

459
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:03,337
And things
are going well.

460
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,780
I think for once
in my life,

461
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:08,375
I will exercise
a little self-control.

462
00:28:13,957 --> 00:28:15,948
Thanks for the drink.

463
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:35,043
Guy sent this over.

464
00:28:35,078 --> 00:28:37,603
I saw that guy
in the field the other day.

465
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:39,638
When we were
practicing dummy drag,

466
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:42,049
he spent the whole time
in the bleachers staring.

467
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:45,282
Yeah?
Vince, come here.

468
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:47,313
Join us.

469
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:52,925
He's a very funny guy.
Great sense of humor.

470
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:54,692
- Thanks for this.
- Thanks.

471
00:28:54,731 --> 00:28:56,926
My pleasure.

472
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,128
We were talking about
a call we had last month.

473
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:02,468
- We were lucky the roof held.
- Did anyone hear that Yma Sumac scream

474
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:04,632
when the ceiling fan
came down? That was Ron.

475
00:29:04,674 --> 00:29:06,665
The goddamn thing
almost killed me.

476
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,235
You would have
screamed too, you cunt.

477
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,646
Fucking nancies.
Don't argue now.

478
00:29:12,682 --> 00:29:16,618
You know, guys, we've got to get serious
about the state muster next month.

479
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:19,588
Last year Hinsdale
whipped our butt in that ladder carry.

480
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:22,820
- What's that, a Deuce?
- Fat Boy.

481
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:25,828
Chromed out the forks.

482
00:29:25,862 --> 00:29:29,354
- Nice.
- You ride?

483
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:33,096
I always wanted a Panhead.
Never happened.

484
00:29:33,136 --> 00:29:35,263
You should get a bike.

485
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:37,273
Out here when the leaves
are changing,

486
00:29:37,307 --> 00:29:39,468
blasting down
the Daniel Webster Highway,

487
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:43,275
- there's nothing else like it.
- Yeah.

488
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:45,042
I bet.

489
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:50,684
You know,
I'm glad you decided

490
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,052
to write your book
in our little town.

491
00:29:58,995 --> 00:30:01,691
What the fuck you doing?
What are you, some kind of fag?

492
00:30:01,731 --> 00:30:04,097
- Guess I made a mistake.
- You sure as fuck did.

493
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:07,228
Listen, closet queen, you can't handle
it, don't sent out the signals.

494
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:28,119
Dirty fighter, huh?

495
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:32,060
Asshole.

496
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:47,466
See that?
You didn't even notice.

497
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,204
What?

498
00:30:52,248 --> 00:30:54,216
That salami

499
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,218
40% less fat
and sodium.

500
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:58,243
You know...

501
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,248
you're always
looking out for me.

502
00:31:04,294 --> 00:31:06,285
I'm very lucky to have you.

503
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:10,232
And don't you
forget it.

504
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:15,769
Hey, Prince Albert,
you know what time it is?

506
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,178
And these late nights
are getting to be

507
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:25,272
a real habit with you, AJ.
Don't you have to work today?

508
00:31:25,315 --> 00:31:27,783
Look, I gotta
talk to you guys.

509
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:30,843
I need new clothes.
Everything I have is so old.

510
00:31:30,887 --> 00:31:34,220
You got money.
You sold your drums.

511
00:31:34,257 --> 00:31:36,691
And I need that money
for living expenses.

512
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:38,694
What do you think
clothes are?

513
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:41,458
No, I mean nice clothes,
not socks and underwear.

514
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:44,228
Oh, so you can go out
to the clubs with...

515
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:46,701
Fernando.
That kid is a creep.

516
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:49,296
Hernan. And he's not a creep.
He's my friend.

517
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,603
And I don't talk about
your friends that way.

518
00:31:51,641 --> 00:31:53,632
When they were in school,
Hernan's mother and I

519
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:55,405
were on the faculty
lunch committee.

520
00:31:55,445 --> 00:31:57,845
- Hernan has a reading disability.
- Fuck that.

521
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:59,781
And we're not giving you
any more money.

522
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:02,717
Frankly, AJ,
I am a little concerned...

523
00:32:02,752 --> 00:32:04,720
the clubs, sleeping late,

524
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:06,813
your lack of interest
in anything productive.

525
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:08,824
Hey, I'm interested
in productive stuff,

526
00:32:08,858 --> 00:32:10,826
just not stuff
you care about.

527
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,522
- I could run one of those clubs.
- What?

528
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:15,963
Look, I'm not just partying there.
I'm learning.

529
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:17,728
I see what works,
what doesn't.

530
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:19,496
I could have a great club,

531
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:21,333
and really successful.

532
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,396
If you guys care so much
about my future,

533
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,930
then why don't you
stake me?

534
00:32:24,974 --> 00:32:27,204
In a club?
Get the hell out of here.

535
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:29,768
You pick up the garbage
in a lot of clubs in New York.

536
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:32,475
You know people. You could help me.
It's not like you can't

537
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:34,949
afford to set me up.
You have all the money in the world.

538
00:32:34,984 --> 00:32:37,418
This is ridiculous.
Manage a club, AJ?

539
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:39,615
You've never even been
a busboy.

540
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:41,624
If you wanna get back
into event planning,

541
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:44,320
you should think about the Culinary
Institute in Poughkeepsie.

542
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,227
Culinary Institute? Why do you keep
talking about event planning?

543
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:48,855
I don't even know
what that is.

544
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:51,025
If you're serious,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

545
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:52,625
I'll get you a job at Beansie's

546
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:54,603
and you can learn the business
from the ground up.

547
00:32:54,637 --> 00:32:56,332
That's a fucking pizza parlor,
not a club.

548
00:32:56,372 --> 00:32:57,964
It's the service
industry!

549
00:32:58,007 --> 00:32:59,804
Why are we even
having this discussion?

550
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:01,936
You're going back to college
next semester.

551
00:33:01,978 --> 00:33:03,878
See? This is
just what I mean.

552
00:33:03,913 --> 00:33:06,347
You guys never give me any support
in anything I wanna do.

553
00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:08,350
AJ!

554
00:33:08,384 --> 00:33:10,682
God damn him.

555
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,484
This is fucking
demoralizing.

556
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:22,292
Maybe we should get him a club,
give him some responsibility.

557
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:24,197
Maybe he'll rise
to the occasion.

558
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:27,465
Are you insane?
He's not even legal drinking age.

559
00:33:27,504 --> 00:33:29,495
Well, yeah yeah.

560
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:36,567
It's like a... bad smell
in the house.

561
00:33:37,914 --> 00:33:39,973
It's always
hanging there.

562
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:43,213
More than that,
it's no good for me and Carmela.

563
00:33:45,188 --> 00:33:48,521
'Cause arguing with AJ is no kind
of aphrodisiac, I'll tell you that.

564
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:55,325
Just when I was
beginning to feel

565
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:58,528
physically good again,
like my old self.

566
00:33:58,568 --> 00:34:01,867
- Good. I see.
- But honestly, no one could blame a man

567
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:05,033
for seeking an extracurricular outlet
in a situation like this.

568
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,044
Don't give me that look.

569
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,240
You're always telling me
that I'm projecting.

570
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:13,909
You're projecting.

571
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:17,750
So you're not seeking
an extracurricular outlet?

572
00:34:17,787 --> 00:34:20,585
No. I was just
being theoretical.

573
00:34:21,925 --> 00:34:24,860
What Carmela did for me
when I was hurt,

574
00:34:24,894 --> 00:34:27,624
the way
she took care of me,

575
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:30,861
nursed me back to health,
you think I wanna fucking betray that?

576
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,164
Is it possible
on some level

577
00:34:33,202 --> 00:34:35,727
you blame her
for AJ's problems?

578
00:34:35,772 --> 00:34:38,206
Look, I don't know.

579
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:42,102
No. Carmela's
a good mother.

580
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:46,572
She did her best.

581
00:34:49,018 --> 00:34:51,213
Look, could you
just give me

582
00:34:51,254 --> 00:34:53,222
some practical advice

583
00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:55,224
for once?

584
00:34:55,258 --> 00:34:57,954
Tell me what the fuck to do
about my son?

585
00:34:57,994 --> 00:34:59,962
Well...

586
00:34:59,996 --> 00:35:01,964
I think it's
entirely appropriate

587
00:35:01,998 --> 00:35:03,966
for you and Carmela
to tell AJ.

588
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,798
you have certain
expectations of him,

589
00:35:06,836 --> 00:35:11,273
particularly since he's
living in your home.

590
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:13,298
The most
important thing is

591
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:15,743
that you and Carmela
are in agreement

592
00:35:15,778 --> 00:35:17,746
on the issues,

593
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,748
that you don't
undercut each other

594
00:35:19,782 --> 00:35:22,307
or act at cross-purposes.

595
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:30,221
Here.
So you can buy a suit

596
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:32,727
to look nice for job
or college interviews.

597
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:34,889
This is not for fun.
This is not to be used

598
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:37,365
for any kind
of personal entertainment.

599
00:35:39,202 --> 00:35:41,102
Thanks.

600
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:32,010
Hi.

601
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:35,149
Hey, Mr. Soprano.
What's going on?

602
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:37,318
Welcome back.

603
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,818
Hey, what's up?
Meet my friends.

604
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:43,593
This is Farhad and...

605
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:46,397
- Daryl. What's up?
- Daryl, AJ Soprano.

606
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:49,269
You know
Tommy Filippo?

607
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:51,034
- Providence?
- No, I don't think so.

608
00:36:51,074 --> 00:36:52,564
Good friend of mine.
He's connected.

609
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,168
Farhad and Daryl
are starting a line of sports drinks.

610
00:36:55,211 --> 00:36:56,701
- Cool.
- Big thing now.

611
00:36:56,746 --> 00:36:58,577
Not just carbs, protein.

612
00:36:58,614 --> 00:37:00,582
When you exercise,
you drink four-to-one

613
00:37:00,616 --> 00:37:02,675
carbohydrate-to-protein
solution

614
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,983
decrease muscle damage,
increase endurance.

615
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:07,751
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- They're looking for investors.

616
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,588
- Maybe we can get you a prospectus, eh?
- Absolutely.

617
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:13,390
For your dad.
You can ask him to look at it.

618
00:37:15,198 --> 00:37:17,860
Do you ever go to Lotus?
Good crowd on Wednesdays.

619
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,801
- I was there twice.
- I was there last week, unbelievable.

620
00:37:23,973 --> 00:37:27,568
Hey, wake me up
tomorrow, okay? 10:00?

621
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:32,978
We were just up
in Bradford.

622
00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:35,882
There's a beautiful
long-truss bridge there.

623
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:37,317
Right.

624
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:39,548
If you're interested
in covered bridges,

625
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:41,386
you need to get over
to Swanzey.

626
00:37:41,424 --> 00:37:43,619
They have four marvelous
bridges there,

627
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:45,627
including a queen post.

628
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:48,789
Honey, we could
go tomorrow.

629
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:51,163
You know where else
you should go is Shaker Village.

630
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,998
You can't beat those
Shaker brooms.

631
00:37:54,036 --> 00:37:56,129
Oh, I love old brooms!

632
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:06,144
AJ!

633
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:08,616
I woke you up two hours ago
like you asked me.

634
00:38:08,651 --> 00:38:10,642
Now get up.

635
00:38:14,223 --> 00:38:16,248
- Ouch.
- Carl, are you all right?

636
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:23,865
It is 4:00
in the afternoon.

637
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,527
You are not even dressed!

638
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:27,968
I got the impression
you had something important to do.

639
00:38:52,094 --> 00:38:55,063
- There you go, Corrado.
- How come I don't get no mail?

640
00:38:55,097 --> 00:38:57,065
Maybe you need
to write some letters,

641
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:59,329
start a correspondence.

642
00:39:00,336 --> 00:39:02,600
Lying cocksucker!

643
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:04,936
They throw my mail out.

644
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:12,206
Your uncle is having dinner,
but you can see him now.

645
00:39:12,248 --> 00:39:14,239
Warren will take you in.

646
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:19,254
This way.

647
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,828
Wait for me, please.

648
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:44,803
He's over here.

649
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:50,249
- Corrado, you have a visitor.
- What?

650
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:54,886
Anthony!
My nephew.

651
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:58,225
Take me home.
I wanna go home.

652
00:40:00,162 --> 00:40:01,959
Knife!

653
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:03,932
That's not my knife.

654
00:40:03,966 --> 00:40:06,799
Hey! Hey hey hey!

655
00:40:06,836 --> 00:40:09,566
- Let go of me! Let go of me!
- Take it easy.

656
00:40:09,605 --> 00:40:11,937
- He shot my dad!
- Relax.

657
00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:13,965
- He shot my dad!
- Relax. Take it easy.

658
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:26,114
Anthony Soprano.

659
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:28,589
Yeah. I just talked
to Assemblyman Zellman.

660
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:30,615
Get him out of here.

661
00:40:53,649 --> 00:40:55,640
My stomach hurts.

662
00:40:58,621 --> 00:41:01,852
You stupid fucking moron. You realize
what could have happened to you

663
00:41:01,891 --> 00:41:04,086
if we didn't have
connections?!

664
00:41:04,126 --> 00:41:06,219
Some cop goes by the book
and they charge you

665
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:08,787
with attempted murder!
You hear me?

666
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:11,265
Attempted murder!
Then what? Then what?

667
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,792
He shot you! You were just gonna let him
fucking get away with it?

668
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:17,362
I told you that's
my business, not yours!

669
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:19,772
And what did you do?
Nothing!

670
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:21,538
Zero!
A big fucking jerk-off!

671
00:41:21,577 --> 00:41:24,569
- Fuck you!
- I oughta break your fucking neck!

672
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,247
Stop cryin'.
Stop cryin'!

673
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:44,430
I guess your heart was
in the right place, AJ.

674
00:41:45,901 --> 00:41:49,132
But it's wrong.
Come on.

675
00:41:49,171 --> 00:41:52,971
- What?!
- It's not in your nature.

676
00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:56,342
You don't know me.
And you don't know anything about me.

677
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:59,815
You're a nice guy and that's a good
thing, for Christ's sakes.

678
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:03,250
- Bullshit!
- I mean it.

679
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:06,855
You're a good guy.
I'm very grateful.

680
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:08,857
Well, you're a fucking
hypocrite,

681
00:42:08,891 --> 00:42:11,052
because every time
we watch "Godfather"

682
00:42:11,093 --> 00:42:14,028
when Michael Corleone
shoots those guys at the restaurant,

683
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:16,031
those assholes
who tried to kill his dad,

684
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:18,499
you sit there with your fucking
bowl of ice cream

685
00:42:18,534 --> 00:42:21,025
and you say it's your
favorite scene of all time!

686
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,868
Jesus Christ, AJ...

687
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,342
you make me wanna cry.

688
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:36,408
It's a movie.

689
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:42,315
You gotta grow up.

690
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:45,860
You're not a kid anymore.

691
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:47,863
Did you hear me?
You gotta grow up.

692
00:42:56,105 --> 00:42:57,936
Get in the car.

693
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:18,360
First of all, your mother does not
find out about this.

694
00:43:38,814 --> 00:43:40,304
Yes?

695
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:43,182
I know you don't wanna sell,
but I thought you should know.

696
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:46,382
Jamba Juice upped their offer
to 275 a square foot.

697
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:48,287
$494,000.

698
00:43:48,324 --> 00:43:50,292
You're kiddin' me.

699
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:52,954
Plus they'll let you
carry the note at 7.5%.

700
00:43:52,995 --> 00:43:55,361
Any interest?

701
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:08,610
- Sold.
- Excellent.

702
00:44:08,644 --> 00:44:11,374
Why don't you come by my office
tonight and sign the papers?

703
00:44:11,413 --> 00:44:13,438
Look, uh...

704
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:16,212
how about
your apartment instead?

705
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:19,980
Good idea.
Want me to give you the address?

706
00:44:20,022 --> 00:44:22,547
I remember.
The glove factory.

707
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:25,151
See you around 9:00?

708
00:44:25,194 --> 00:44:27,856
Yeah. Okay.
I'll see you then.

709
00:44:39,608 --> 00:44:42,338
Can I get an order
of johnnycakes?

710
00:44:44,747 --> 00:44:48,080
- Short stack or tall?
- Tall.

711
00:45:03,899 --> 00:45:05,730
Coffee?

712
00:45:11,106 --> 00:45:13,870
Sometimes you tell
a lie so long...

713
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:17,711
you don't know
when to stop.

714
00:45:21,383 --> 00:45:23,442
You don't know
when it's safe.

715
00:45:25,888 --> 00:45:27,879
I hear you.

716
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:40,202
You looking for your
French blue?

717
00:45:40,236 --> 00:45:42,204
Here, I just ironed it.

718
00:45:42,238 --> 00:45:44,229
Thanks.

719
00:45:47,176 --> 00:45:49,337
The Canali.
Very nice.

720
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:51,346
Where are you going?

721
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,178
I've got a... real estate thing.

722
00:45:56,652 --> 00:45:58,916
My handsome man.

723
00:46:23,846 --> 00:46:26,110
I can't get used
to this torque.

724
00:46:26,148 --> 00:46:28,207
What?

725
00:46:50,105 --> 00:46:52,733
So my landlord,
this fucking Armenian asshole,

726
00:46:52,775 --> 00:46:55,903
won't give me my deposit back.
Seven grand!

727
00:46:55,944 --> 00:46:58,310
My dad's, like,
super pissed!

728
00:46:58,347 --> 00:47:00,815
Anyway, I was thinking
maybe you could talk to your dad

729
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:03,215
who could send someone
to lean on this prick a little

730
00:47:03,252 --> 00:47:05,618
and get him to give me
my money back.

731
00:47:07,523 --> 00:47:09,514
Soprano's the man!

732
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:32,147
Hey, are you okay?

733
00:47:32,181 --> 00:47:34,581
You want some...?

734
00:47:34,616 --> 00:47:36,607
No.

735
00:47:39,254 --> 00:47:41,222
Hi.

736
00:47:41,256 --> 00:47:43,690
Champagne?

737
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:47,093
- We're celebrating, aren't we?
- I guess.

738
00:47:48,564 --> 00:47:52,000
In the trade, this is called
"the Ben Franklin close",

739
00:47:52,034 --> 00:47:55,231
placing the pen
on the line you want someone to sign.

740
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:57,465
Theoretically, it makes it
harder for them

741
00:47:57,506 --> 00:47:59,497
to have second thoughts.

742
00:48:00,843 --> 00:48:03,539
I'll have to show you
my collection sometime,

743
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:06,514
"the Franklin Mint."

744
00:48:06,548 --> 00:48:08,675
- You're not serious.
- What do you mean?

745
00:48:08,717 --> 00:48:10,685
Okay, the contract.

747
00:48:12,721 --> 00:48:15,656
Sign here,

748
00:48:15,691 --> 00:48:18,057
and here,

749
00:48:19,795 --> 00:48:21,786
here,

750
00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:25,289
and here,

751
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:29,132
and here,

752
00:48:31,473 --> 00:48:34,636
and deed of trust here,

753
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:39,212
disclosures here.

754
00:48:41,049 --> 00:48:42,914
Initial it here.

755
00:48:44,953 --> 00:48:47,649
Okay, title ID there.

756
00:48:50,459 --> 00:48:53,257
Okay, phase one,

757
00:48:53,295 --> 00:48:55,855
sign here,

758
00:48:57,766 --> 00:48:59,757
and there,

759
00:49:01,804 --> 00:49:03,795
and here.

760
00:49:05,507 --> 00:49:07,407
And...

761
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:10,105
that's it.

762
00:49:52,287 --> 00:49:53,549
Stop.

763
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:56,353
- What?
- Just stop.

764
00:49:56,391 --> 00:49:58,052
Okay.

765
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:10,302
- Am I done?
- "Done"?

766
00:50:10,339 --> 00:50:12,307
Yes, signing.
Am I done?

767
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:15,174
Yeah.

768
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,201
I gotta go.

769
00:50:47,976 --> 00:50:50,206
Shit.

770
00:50:51,713 --> 00:50:53,908
Hey. Hey, man,
are you all right?

771
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:58,045
I'm a doctor.
Do you want me to call an ambulance?

772
00:50:58,086 --> 00:51:01,578
My heart,
it's beating so fast.

773
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:04,148
Did you take anything,
cocaine, amphetamines?

774
00:51:04,192 --> 00:51:05,489
No.

775
00:51:05,527 --> 00:51:08,018
Has anything like this
ever happened to you before?

776
00:51:09,197 --> 00:51:11,688
Do you have a history
of panic attacks?

777
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:24,338
God damn it!

778
00:51:24,379 --> 00:51:26,074
Tony?

779
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:30,279
Hi. How did it go?

780
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,514
What's it take to get some
fucking smoked turkey in this house?

781
00:51:32,554 --> 00:51:34,954
- What?
- I bust my ass all day long,

782
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,254
when I come home
I want a little smoked turkey.

783
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:39,192
Is that too fucking much
to ask?!

784
00:51:39,227 --> 00:51:41,889
What the fuck
is your problem?!

785
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,831
Everything but fucking
turkey in here!

786
00:51:46,535 --> 00:51:48,264
Did you hear?

787
00:51:48,303 --> 00:51:50,100
A goddamn juice place
moving in here.

788
00:51:50,138 --> 00:51:51,765
What Jews?

789
00:51:51,807 --> 00:51:54,571
Juice.
Jamba Juice.

790
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,840
Your boss went
and sold the building.

791
00:51:56,878 --> 00:51:59,403
He sold the building?
I got a kid in college!

792
00:51:59,448 --> 00:52:02,178
Where are
my fucking eggs?

793
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:14,960
What the fuck is happening
to this neighborhood?
