1
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:44,702
How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Michael?

2
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:47,762
Live or die,
make your choice.

3
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:51,207
Who the fuck
are you?

4
00:02:00,752 --> 00:02:02,777
What the fuck
you doing in there?

5
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,948
We're gonna
miss the previews.

6
00:02:07,826 --> 00:02:09,418
What?

7
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:12,453
Tell me your earring went
in the fucking drain again.

8
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:16,423
I'm pregnant.

9
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:21,236
I know it's my fault. I know I shouldn't
have let you take off the rubber.

10
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:24,173
I thought we were okay. I was due for my
period. My cycle's like clockwork.

11
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,336
Stop.

12
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:31,440
- I'll call the clinic tomorrow.
- Stop talking.

13
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:48,993
Let's get married.

14
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:52,003
What?

15
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:55,796
We'll drive to A.C.,
make a day out of it.

16
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,673
Are you serious?

17
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:05,343
Christopher.
I love you.

18
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:16,154
- My baby.
- Yeah.

19
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:18,924
My ex, she couldn't have kids,
and I wanted 'em so bad.

20
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:22,189
The one who
ran out on you?

21
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,870
You can bet she's having some other
asshole's kid, though.

22
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:30,739
That fucking tramp.

23
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:50,054
Elzear, patron saint
of zeppoles.

24
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:53,030
Could use a shot
of lacquer.

25
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:56,397
Fix that halo, too.

26
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,459
Hello.

27
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:00,698
Mr. Gaultieri,
I'm Father Jose.

28
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:03,572
I'm Mr. Gaultieri.
Where's Father Felix?

29
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,439
Unfortunately he's ill.

30
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:07,945
He's having bypass surgery.
He asked me to fill in.

31
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,709
You know Mr. Russamano
from the Neighborhood Association.

32
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:12,808
Sure, Paulie, Chuck,
how you feeling?

33
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:15,945
He was an altar boy.

35
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:21,955
So the Feast
of St. Elzear.

36
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:23,961
Father Felix brought me
up to speed.

37
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:26,122
I'd like to hear your
ideas for this year.

38
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:28,064
Well, there ain't much
to talk about.

39
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:30,590
It's all done through
our nonprofit corporation.

40
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:33,160
We close the streets
for five days,

41
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:35,604
hire the food vendors,
rides, etc.

42
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,608
Day two, we start
the procession,

43
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:39,735
push the statue up
and down the block.

44
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:41,575
You say a couple
of prayers and that's that.

45
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:43,911
All's said and done,
you get your end.

46
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:47,645
About that, as I was
telling Mr. Russamano,

47
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:51,917
frankly $10,000
struck me as quite low.

48
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:53,947
It is what it is.

49
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:56,961
Look, I'm new here.
I certainly don't wanna rock the boat.

50
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:59,725
I realize there are
certain neighborhood traditions.

51
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:02,198
It's just that given the current costs,
we feel an increase

52
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:05,066
- is long overdue.
- What kind of increase?

53
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:08,095
We feel $50,000 would be
a more equitable donation.

54
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,130
- 50?
- Just this year,

55
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,006
we started a soup kitchen
for the homeless,

56
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:13,704
a reading program
for bilingual children.

57
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:15,906
There's less help than ever
from the federal government.

58
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:17,915
You think this feast
pays for itself?

59
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:20,509
Security, electric,
sanitation.

60
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:22,349
- Not to mention fuel costs.
- Yeah.

61
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:25,413
The way it seems
to break down is you spend $18

62
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:27,686
for a city permit
to close down the street,

63
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:29,818
charge fees
to the vendors

64
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,159
in the thousands
of dollars to lease out land

65
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,858
that you don't
even own.

66
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:37,197
Yeah? Well, it seems to me the church
has plenty in its coffers

67
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:40,534
for all those
pedophilia lawsuits.

68
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:43,803
The parish's deal was negotiated since
this was Johnny Soprano's feast.

69
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:46,675
These are different times,
Mr. Gaultieri.

70
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,406
Well, some things
don't change.

71
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:51,506
Couple of days, Joe Vella from the Honor
Guard will be by with the float.

72
00:05:51,549 --> 00:05:54,347
Transfer the statue
from his niche,

73
00:05:54,385 --> 00:05:56,512
pick up the hat
and other stuff.

74
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:58,715
You say things
don't change.

75
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:00,724
This feast was started
over 100 years ago

76
00:06:00,758 --> 00:06:02,658
in a spirit of giving.

77
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,753
Italian immigrants,
the working poor

78
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:07,856
gave what little money
they had to honor St. Elzear.

79
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,561
He's the patron saint
from my grandparent's town,

80
00:06:10,602 --> 00:06:12,263
Ariano di Puglia.

81
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:14,567
Many of those folks gave their gold
wedding bands, which were melted

82
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:16,665
- down to make the saint's hat.
- Yeah?

83
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,906
The Holy Society
of St. Elzear,

84
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:24,506
of which you are
recording secretary,

85
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:27,245
has for the past
100 years entrusted us

86
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:29,879
with the care
of that habiliment.

87
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:34,314
Frankly...

88
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:36,725
I don't feel safe
giving it over this year.

89
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:39,229
We use it every year.
It's part of the tradition.

90
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:41,232
I understand,
but I'm sorry.

91
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:44,235
Given the tenor of this conversation,
I sense there's a possible

92
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:45,861
criminal element
in this neighborhood

93
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:49,601
that could endanger
this precious piece of local history.

94
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:53,737
But for 50 grand,
you wouldn't have that sense.

95
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:56,872
It would demonstrate to me that you
take this feast as seriously

96
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,439
as the people
who began it.

97
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:03,310
Okay, Father,
nice meeting you.

98
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,765
Fuck the hat!

99
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,108
It's fucking bullshit.

100
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:26,303
I got a fax from Eddie Lind,
Allegheny Carting.

101
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:29,939
They wanna raise
the tipping fee again on solid waste.

102
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:32,814
Just the man
I wanted to see.

103
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,479
I gotta go down to Pennsylvania
and I'm gonna need backup.

104
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:39,081
I'm busy managing
the feast.

105
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:42,183
Vice president
in charge of calzones.

106
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:44,353
Where the fuck
you been anyway?

107
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:48,959
Is that what
I think it is?

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,231
You are now looking
at a newly married man.

109
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,000
- Holy shit!
- Kelli?

110
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:59,740
What the fuck
brought this on?

111
00:07:59,777 --> 00:08:02,405
Visit from the stork
coming up.

112
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:06,250
You never heard
of pulling out?

113
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:08,684
Sweetheart, little
Cristal over here.

114
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,086
- You know what you're having?
- Boy, I hope.

115
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:14,285
I tell you, T,
with the example you set,

116
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:16,885
plus the wisdom
I learned from AA,

117
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:19,123
it's an inspiration,
building blocks,

118
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:21,461
home, family.

119
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:24,662
Yeah, that's what
it's all about, kid.

120
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:26,670
Just water for me.

121
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:29,070
My son will
be my strength.

122
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,475
Yeah.

123
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:36,309
I did?

124
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:38,338
What are you,
new in the office?

125
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:40,715
Talk to Dr. Cipolla.

126
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:42,947
I don't pay
for missed appointments.

127
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:46,718
- To the baby.
- To the baby.

128
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:48,749
- Salut.
- Salut.

129
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:52,890
Make a note to call
Freddie at DiSorbo's.

130
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,921
He wants to sponsor
the cannoli-eating contest,

131
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,434
I better see an envelope
by tomorrow.

132
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:03,707
Anyway, my guy
at the weigh station's on board.

133
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:06,073
- You know how to get back, right?
- I MapBlasted it.

134
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,203
All right, see you guys.

135
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,581
Look, Pittsburgh.

136
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:20,022
What the fuck?
We're supposed to be headed east.

137
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:25,892
Are we 0.7 miles
past Route 62 yet?

138
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:30,029
I gotta take a piss.

139
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,426
You seeing this?

140
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,628
Looks like bikers.

141
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,939
Wooden crates.

142
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,967
It's good wine.

143
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,836
- What the fuck?
- Who the fuck are you guys?

144
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:49,608
- That's who I am, you mangy cocksucker.
- Take it easy.

145
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:53,276
On the ground or I'll blow your greasy
fucking heads off.

146
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:55,649
- You guys cops?
- How's your incision, Lieutenant?

147
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:57,244
10-4.

148
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:58,846
You're fucking with
the Vipers here, asshole.

149
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,983
Really?

150
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:03,619
What's that,
your Girl Scout troop?

151
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:05,595
Just shut up,
fucking douchebag.

152
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,791
Let's go.

153
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:13,499
Get him!

154
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:24,677
I hit him!
I fucking hit him!

155
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:27,309
Fuck you!

157
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:40,864
That was fucking awesome.
Fucking old-school shit.

158
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:42,661
Opportunity knocked.

159
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,498
Knocked? Kicked
the fucking door in.

160
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:49,907
Oh, fuck!

161
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:51,738
You okay, T?

162
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:54,267
Fucking ankle,
I guess I sprained it.

163
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:02,850
You smell that?
It's fucking autumn.

164
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:05,754
It's like the first fall night when
you're a kid, and the air's all crisp,

165
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,122
and you start smelling
people's fireplaces.

166
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,150
Smells like Halloween.

169
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:27,068
Chateau Pichon-Longueville,
1986.

170
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:29,477
'86... ooh, baby.

171
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:31,674
Show me the money.

172
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,510
What's your corkage fee?

173
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:40,589
How about that prick's
face when he saw the gat?

174
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,729
The Grizzly Adams
motherfucker?

175
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:49,130
"Whoa, take it easy."

176
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,999
"We're with the Vipers."

177
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:06,709
How's that wine, good?

178
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:10,687
It really is,
I gotta say.

179
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:15,883
I tell you, though,

180
00:13:15,926 --> 00:13:18,121
when he pulled
that trigger,

181
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:20,096
I almost shit myself.

182
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,790
Yeah.

183
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:33,804
I miss it sometimes.
I'll be honest.

184
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,946
The wine.

185
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,118
You should toast
at your wedding, at least.

186
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:43,643
Your kid.

187
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:48,248
Discipline, that's all.

188
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:51,090
Set limits for myself.

189
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:01,601
You know, on the other side,
they consider wine food.

190
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,698
Oh, yeah?

191
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:08,312
- Salut.
- Salut.

192
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:18,688
I'm gonna have to
sleep on my back.

193
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,550
- What are you doing?
- Nightcap.

194
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:26,154
There's a Swiss Army
in the console.

195
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:34,336
When you think of the shit
we've been through, huh?

196
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:36,431
Shit we've done.

197
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:43,036
Fucking
Three Musketeers.

198
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:52,584
We got a bond.

199
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,685
It's very special.

200
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,831
You saved my life
in a lot of ways.

201
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,839
You've been there for me,
too, you know?

202
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,008
Don't think
I don't know that.

203
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:15,205
There were times

204
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:17,214
it was hard
with me and you.

205
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:18,875
I didn't understand.

206
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:25,547
You were young.

207
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:27,614
Stubborn.

208
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:31,192
You always had
my back, though.

209
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:37,260
Like that day
when I came to the house.

210
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,600
I gotta talk to you.

211
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:04,020
What's wrong?

212
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:07,660
What's the matter?

213
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:10,963
You know I've always
been loyal to you, T.

214
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:14,630
What are you trying
to tell me, Christopher?

215
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:21,034
I can't even say it.

216
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:26,873
Oh, fuck.

217
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,646
Adriana.

218
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:32,321
What about her?

219
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:35,548
The feds.

220
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,031
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

221
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,198
How long?

222
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,004
- How fucking long?
- A year, I don't know.

223
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:55,944
When did you find out?

224
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,313
She just told me
last night.

225
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,477
What do they know, huh?

226
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,352
- What did she give 'em?
- I don't know.

227
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:08,889
Might take a lot.

228
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:11,622
Ralphie?

229
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:13,926
I don't know.

230
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,333
Oh, Tony, how could
you even think that?

231
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,502
Where is she?

232
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:30,871
- Where the fuck is she? Where is she?
- Please, Ton'.

233
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:33,509
Where is she?

234
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:35,542
She's home.

235
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:44,321
I can't.
I can't do it, Ton'.

236
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,921
No, please,
don't make me do it.

237
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:50,400
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

238
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:52,698
All right.

239
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:54,829
I can't.

240
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:56,601
- All right.
- I can't do it.

241
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,801
I'm gonna
take care of it.

242
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:03,838
All right.

243
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:06,281
Come on, come on.

244
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:09,684
Now listen to me.

245
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,881
You go upstairs.

246
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:14,288
You go out
the back door.

247
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:16,316
Don't talk to Carmela.

248
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:22,288
You go someplace,
have a cup of coffee.

249
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,801
You wait
till I call you.

251
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:29,963
It's okay. We're gonna
take care of it.

252
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:35,402
Go ahead.

253
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,686
I love you, man.

254
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,527
I love you, too.

255
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:48,014
- I like it.
- Welcome.

256
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:51,180
- Joan Gillespie, Pagano Realty.
- Kelli Moltisanti.

257
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:54,452
We spoke on the phone.
My husband Christopher.

258
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:57,392
- How do you do?
- This is what I'm talking about.

259
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:59,623
"Stately Wayne Manor."

260
00:19:59,663 --> 00:20:03,531
Four bedrooms, marble baths
with Kohler fixtures.

261
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,831
Sub-Zero in the
stainless steel kitchen.

262
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:07,803
We'll take it.

263
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:09,965
He's what we call
an impulse buyer.

264
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:12,168
Shouldn't we see
the inside first, sweetie?

265
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:15,076
If it has an inside,
we're buying it.

266
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:39,032
Where's the rest?
Five days rent in advance, I said.

267
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:42,835
What if it rains? Ohio State Fair gives
you a rebate for bad weather.

268
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:45,364
Yet another reason
I don't live in Ohio.

269
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:51,370
Easy on the sugar, hon'.
They tell me I'm sweet enough.

270
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:54,608
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

271
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:59,612
Jesus Christ,
what did he do now?

272
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:01,624
It's an old polo injury.

273
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:08,794
Let me talk to you a minute.

274
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,038
Couple of guys we know,

275
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:17,506
Lebanese or some shit,

276
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,133
they diverted a truck,

277
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:21,440
whole semi-trailer full
of Centrum Multivitamins.

278
00:21:21,478 --> 00:21:23,446
That's a fucking score.

279
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,448
Yeah, the thing is
it's gotta be unloaded out of state,

280
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:29,145
'cause the troopers are on it.
You interested?

281
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:32,781
Could be distributed
in Long Island.

282
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:35,348
What's my end?

283
00:21:35,392 --> 00:21:38,589
50-50, but it's
gotta be done now, tonight.

284
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,620
Tonight?

285
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:47,297
All right,
but in this case,

286
00:21:47,337 --> 00:21:50,602
I'm thinking we spare John the stress
of having to hear about this.

287
00:21:57,247 --> 00:22:00,808
The situation he's in,
he's got enough to deal with.

288
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:08,355
Get me Frankie Cosme
on the cell.

289
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,238
Yeah, somebody wants
to talk to you. Hold on.

290
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:41,649
Did you pray?

291
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:43,853
Said a "thank you"
for Daddy's recovery.

292
00:22:45,395 --> 00:22:49,161
You had arthroscopic surgery,
you can't bend a knee?

293
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:53,234
Dad said he's gonna
meet us on the corner.

294
00:22:55,272 --> 00:22:57,672
Isn't that Ade's mom?

295
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:01,337
- Oh my God. She looks terrible.
- Who?

296
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:04,370
Chris' ex, her mom.

297
00:23:04,414 --> 00:23:06,746
She saw us.
I should say hello.

298
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:12,617
Liz, hi.

299
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:15,147
I saw you're on the committee.
That's so great.

300
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:17,183
Carmela Soprano.

301
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:20,060
- How's your daughter?
- Fine.

302
00:23:20,097 --> 00:23:22,031
Well, mine is dead.

303
00:23:22,065 --> 00:23:23,692
Oh my God, when?
What happened?

304
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:27,261
When? That piece
of shit, your nephew.

305
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:30,273
They broke up, Liz.
She ran off.

306
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:32,571
She doesn't call me
for almost two years.

307
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:34,600
My birthday,
Christmas.

308
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:37,614
You two always did have
a very difficult relationship.

309
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:39,741
The FBI came
to my home.

310
00:23:39,783 --> 00:23:42,752
You'd be amazed
at the questions they asked me.

311
00:23:42,786 --> 00:23:44,879
- Liz...
- They admitted

312
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:46,549
they think that he killed her.

313
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,558
Come on, Liz,
you're drunk.

314
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:51,857
Drunk?
It's called depression.

315
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:54,557
I haven't had a drink
in years.

316
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:02,265
There were times,
I was a kid,

317
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:05,275
my friend Ronnie, we'd play
on the floor of my kitchen,

318
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:09,075
linoleum, Matchbox cars
or whatever.

319
00:24:09,112 --> 00:24:12,013
He'd go home, his fucking knees
would be filthy.

320
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:15,917
His elbows.
She never cleaned, my mother.

321
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:18,444
Fucking house
was a pigsty.

322
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:22,424
Ronnie's mother made
him stop coming over it was so dirty.

323
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:25,257
- That's fucked up.
- Embarrassing.

324
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:27,820
My kid,
it'll be different.

325
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:30,332
He'll be proud
of his house.

326
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:32,699
Wait till you see
this place.

327
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,903
So that thing,
Rusty Milio,

328
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,966
I heard that happened.

329
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,979
Good job.

330
00:24:43,013 --> 00:24:45,004
It's a little less cash
than we talked about.

331
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:47,448
But there's a bonus
in there for you.

332
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,918
It's okay
if I fix?

333
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,087
Just take me
to my car.

334
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:01,825
Rock out
with your cock out.

335
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:12,841
Fireplace,
parquet floors,

336
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:16,812
bumper pool table
in the basement.

337
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:19,839
The house I'm getting.

338
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:22,044
You'll come over.

339
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:25,213
Christmas,
Christmas Eve, maybe.

340
00:25:25,255 --> 00:25:27,985
I'm gonna start
a tradition.

341
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:33,260
You know, you really gotta
get yourself some help with this shit.

342
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:35,127
I will.
I'm gonna.

343
00:25:43,006 --> 00:25:44,974
Those fucking works,
though.

344
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:48,409
Whets my whistle, that spike.
Why is that?

345
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:52,038
I don't know.

346
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:57,880
You want some?

347
00:25:57,921 --> 00:25:59,718
Me? Nah.

348
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:06,522
Okay, it's just,
you know, if you want.

349
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:11,891
Guess I could toot some.

350
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,739
I remember,

351
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:25,543
when I did
a lot of blow,

352
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:27,550
I used
to get diarrhea

353
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:29,984
just from the smell
of paper money,

354
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,514
in a store,
any fucking place,

355
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:36,958
on account of all
the baby laxative in the coke

356
00:26:36,993 --> 00:26:39,587
when you actually
snort it.

357
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:43,759
I meant what I said,
though,

358
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,133
you need to get
your ass to rehab.

359
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,367
Fucking Narcotics
Anonymous or some shit.

360
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:07,390
How do you like
this car?

361
00:27:07,424 --> 00:27:11,827
It's nice,
the leather.

362
00:29:59,763 --> 00:30:01,458
See you.

363
00:30:04,734 --> 00:30:06,895
Here he comes.

364
00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:09,302
God bless you,
St. Elzear.

365
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:11,933
Where's his gold hat?

366
00:30:22,452 --> 00:30:25,444
Pray for my mother,
St. Elzear.

367
00:30:25,488 --> 00:30:28,116
Hey, they forgot
his hat.

368
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,194
This is my nephew George,
just back from Iraq.

369
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:38,462
- Two tours he done.
- I'm proud of you, my friend.

370
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:48,177
What do you need?

371
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:50,202
I don't know.

372
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:55,550
There's prosciutto in there,
some leftover sesame noodles.

373
00:30:57,854 --> 00:31:00,322
Tofu would make
your doctor happy.

374
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:17,062
How's the ankle?

375
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:18,836
It's better.

376
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,866
Cold packs helped.

377
00:31:22,345 --> 00:31:25,508
Did you have
the riser fixed?

378
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:29,609
Yeah, yeah, Brian Spatafore
was over the Pork Store.

379
00:31:29,652 --> 00:31:32,883
Had him tighten up
the banister, everything.

380
00:31:32,922 --> 00:31:34,913
You all right?

381
00:31:37,827 --> 00:31:39,795
I have been debating
all night whether

382
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:42,024
to even say anything
about this.

383
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:50,298
I ran into Liz La Cerva
at the feast.

384
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:55,277
- Yeah...
- She's got it in her head

385
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:57,745
that Christopher
killed Adriana.

386
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,913
What?
That's insane.

387
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:06,786
I know.

388
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:10,054
Then again, he does have
a history of being free with his hands.

389
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:12,527
That makes him O.J.?

390
00:32:12,562 --> 00:32:14,792
She was probably drunk.

391
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:17,163
I really don't
think she was.

392
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:22,631
Let me school you
on domestic violence, okay?

393
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:25,869
First and foremost,
there's always a body.

394
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,639
And 99 out of 100,

395
00:32:28,678 --> 00:32:30,976
and this comes straight
from my cop buddies,

396
00:32:31,014 --> 00:32:34,950
it happens either
in the bedroom or in the kitchen.

397
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:38,411
He killed her,

398
00:32:38,455 --> 00:32:40,855
believe me with the forensics
they got nowadays,

399
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,917
the fibers,
we'd know about it.

400
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:48,397
The FBI came
to her house, Liz.

401
00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:51,332
That's exactly my point.
If they really thought he did it,

402
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:54,200
how fast do you think
they'd haul his ass in?

403
00:32:57,707 --> 00:32:59,834
Sour grapes, Carm.

404
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:02,970
He dumps her daughter, all of a sudden
he's Scott fucking Peterson.

405
00:33:03,012 --> 00:33:07,415
- I thought Ade dumped him.
- You know what I mean.

406
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,644
She was a sweet girl, Ade,

407
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:11,119
but the two of them together
was a toxic relationship.

408
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:14,248
Yeah, they did have
a rough time of it.

409
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,258
And he's doing great,
Christopher.

410
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:18,260
He's a different person.

411
00:33:18,294 --> 00:33:20,262
He's married.
He's got a kid on the way.

412
00:33:20,296 --> 00:33:22,457
He's focused.

413
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:25,957
Let's not sabotage
his progress.

415
00:33:40,383 --> 00:33:43,318
Have a dozen extra large
brought over to Satriale's.

416
00:33:45,355 --> 00:33:47,983
- Hello.
- Paul, Dr. Cipolla.

417
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:51,391
I'm on my way out. I received
the results of your PSA test.

418
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:53,691
- And?
- Not to worry.

419
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,755
But the numbers
are a little higher than I prefer.

420
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:58,790
- What does that mean?
- Probably nothing.

421
00:33:58,835 --> 00:34:02,327
Likelihood is prostatitis,
simple inflammation.

422
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:05,705
You have a history
of prostate cancer in your family?

423
00:34:05,742 --> 00:34:08,802
- Father maybe?
- I don't know.

424
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:11,609
Well, I'd like to go ahead
and schedule you for a biopsy.

425
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:17,475
This is lame.
I wanna go on the Octopus.

426
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,715
Can you stop for one minute
breaking my balls?

427
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:22,020
When your father gets
back from the bathroom with Sophia,

428
00:34:22,058 --> 00:34:24,322
- you can go on whatever.
- It's a kiddie ride.

429
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,988
Yeah, but she wants
to go on the ride with her big brother.

430
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,466
Here we go!
You ready, baby?

431
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,058
Go for a ride
with Mama?

432
00:34:32,101 --> 00:34:34,001
This is too small.
I'll be all squished.

433
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:36,369
Yeah, so you go sit
in that one, and wave to her.

434
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:38,533
Oh, there's my girl.

435
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:41,738
There's my girl!

436
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:45,077
Yeah, are you ready to go
on the ride with Mama?

437
00:34:46,215 --> 00:34:49,116
Are you ready?
Get ready.

438
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:51,586
Yeah,
we're gonna go soon.

439
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:55,352
Oh, here we go!

440
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:58,417
All around the floor.

441
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:01,555
Wipe that puss
off your face.

442
00:35:25,154 --> 00:35:28,282
- My baby!
- Oh my God, call an ambulance!

443
00:35:28,324 --> 00:35:30,554
Excuse me!

444
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:33,426
It's okay. It's okay.

445
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:35,055
This is
a temperature gun.

446
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:37,794
217.

447
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:40,029
Look at that.

448
00:35:43,172 --> 00:35:45,640
- Yeah.
- Paulie, it's me.

449
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:48,303
We had a problem down here.
The ride,

450
00:35:48,344 --> 00:35:50,005
the Teacups
or whatever,

451
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:52,344
a bolt busted.
Thing jammed up.

452
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:54,942
- Some people got hurt.
- Where's the guy who owns it?

453
00:35:54,984 --> 00:35:57,282
He's talking
to the cops.

454
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,652
Fine, fuck it.
What do you want from me?

455
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:02,920
It's pretty bad, Paulie.
Lady broke her wrist.

456
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:05,587
Some Puerto Rican kid
lost some teeth.

457
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:07,619
What am I,
a fucking dentist?

458
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:09,894
I don't know.
I thought you'd want to know.

459
00:36:09,932 --> 00:36:12,127
Maybe come down
or something.

460
00:36:12,168 --> 00:36:16,036
I gotta be up in the morning.
I got my fucking biopsy.

461
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:18,506
All right,
I'll take care of it.

462
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:24,779
Now's your last chance
to take advantage...

463
00:36:24,814 --> 00:36:26,782
One second
you're sitting there

464
00:36:26,816 --> 00:36:28,784
enjoying a ride
with your family,

465
00:36:28,818 --> 00:36:31,150
the next your entire
world comes crashing down.

466
00:36:32,522 --> 00:36:34,353
I close my eyes.
I can still hear the screams.

467
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,325
well we should all be
thankful it's okay.

468
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,328
My baby could have
been killed, Tony.

469
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:41,353
God forbid.

470
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:45,857
You can bet the locals
will be parading in with their lawsuits.

471
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:48,029
El mucho pesos.

472
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,908
Just leave it alone,
Janice.

473
00:36:56,412 --> 00:36:58,778
They are entitled
to damages.

474
00:36:58,815 --> 00:37:00,942
Obviously,
there was negligence.

475
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:04,282
Good, so then they'll have excuses
why they can't go to work.

476
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,345
When I think what
could have happened

477
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:08,482
to my baby...

478
00:37:08,524 --> 00:37:10,719
Oh yes, you, Nica.

479
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,921
I'm talking
about you, angel.

480
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:14,554
Oh, God, I wanna
bite those cheeks.

481
00:37:14,597 --> 00:37:18,465
Scumbag hillbilly,
I should have kicked his ass.

482
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:21,402
Yeah, and what
did you do? Nothing.

483
00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:23,803
I was taking Sophia
to the bathroom.

484
00:37:29,912 --> 00:37:33,211
This wine,
Tony, you're right.

485
00:37:33,249 --> 00:37:34,910
Delicious.

486
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:39,747
I was just thinking
it lost some of its...

487
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:42,986
I don't know, pop.

488
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:56,605
Manager.
You gotta move your car.

489
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,233
I said I'm coming.

490
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:07,946
You redneck fuck. My baby was
on that ride with my wife.

491
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:10,578
She woke up this morning,
she could barely move her neck.

492
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,249
I told the cops, mister. I'm sorry.
Insurance will pay your hospital bill.

493
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,817
- $25,000 cash.
- What?

494
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,919
New Jersey has stringent
liability laws.

495
00:38:19,962 --> 00:38:21,953
I told the guy who hired me
I'd have to put on

496
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:24,967
a whole repair crew, work 'em all night.
He wouldn't spring for it.

497
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:27,401
Who, Paulie?
What are you talking about?

498
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:29,529
First off, he wouldn't
pay for my "A" fleet.

499
00:38:29,572 --> 00:38:32,507
I leased that to the Sorghum Festival
down in Atlanta.

500
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:36,969
Okay, the results
of the steroid test are in.

501
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:39,880
The contestants,
they're all clean.

502
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:43,152
I want a fair
contest here.

503
00:38:43,186 --> 00:38:45,814
No biting each other.

504
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:49,222
Ready, set, mangia.

505
00:38:52,328 --> 00:38:55,786
Man, we got some race
going on over here, ladies and gents.

506
00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:57,493
Look at 'em go.

507
00:38:57,533 --> 00:39:00,195
Hey, cocksucker!

508
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:04,002
You hire some fly-by-night
piece of shit and you don't tell nobody?

509
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,167
- Whoa, Bobby.
- What the fuck you talking about?

510
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:07,836
You know what I'm talking
about, you cheap fuck!

511
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:09,868
Bobby, come on!

512
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:12,608
Everybody wants to get rich,
but you don't scrimp on safety.

513
00:39:12,648 --> 00:39:15,981
- Mind your business, Bobby.
- My baby girl was in that car!

514
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:18,509
- You owe me money, Paulie.
- I owe you shit.

515
00:39:18,554 --> 00:39:20,954
- My wife's got nerve damage!
- Fuck her, too!

516
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,015
- Get the fuck off me!
- Easy, easy.

517
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:27,052
Calm down.
Keep moving.

518
00:39:34,604 --> 00:39:38,335
Go ahead, it's over.
Crown the winner.

519
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:41,070
I was at the feast,
St. Elzear's.

520
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,079
The thing for us kids was
to blow powdered sugar

521
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:46,775
on each other
from the zeppoles.

522
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:53,513
Thousands of people
either praying or eating.

523
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:58,425
Anyway, my sister
was on this ride

524
00:39:58,461 --> 00:40:01,453
with my niece
when it lurched forward

525
00:40:01,497 --> 00:40:03,931
- pretty bad.
- God.

526
00:40:03,966 --> 00:40:06,696
He wasn't there,
just Elzear.

527
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:09,068
But he was so busy
getting money pinned to his ass

528
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:12,074
that he got distracted
and a bolt snapped.

529
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:14,406
Were they hurt?

530
00:40:14,443 --> 00:40:16,434
You look around, all these people
are lined up for this shit.

531
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:19,607
The kids, adults,
families.

532
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:21,446
Rides.

533
00:40:21,484 --> 00:40:23,918
Yeah, they pay money
so they can almost puke.

534
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:26,046
They scream, they yell.

535
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:28,420
Why do you think that is?

536
00:40:28,457 --> 00:40:30,482
They're bored.

537
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:33,985
Are you bored?

538
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:42,894
Am I bored?

539
00:40:45,274 --> 00:40:48,175
I got shot in the pancreas
and I recovered.

540
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,235
No brain damage
from the septic shock,

541
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:52,975
like everybody
figured I'd have.

542
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:56,781
You know my feelings.
Every day is a gift.

543
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,547
It's just...

544
00:40:59,588 --> 00:41:03,524
does it have to be
a pair of socks?

545
00:41:07,496 --> 00:41:10,158
I'm joking.

546
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:13,134
I'm joking.

547
00:41:20,142 --> 00:41:21,939
Well, what are
you gonna do?

548
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:24,003
It's the human
condition.

549
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:25,980
What is?

550
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:32,278
I don't know.

551
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:34,289
Yeah, this is Peter Gaultieri.

552
00:41:34,323 --> 00:41:36,814
I'm calling for the result
of my biopsy again.

553
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:39,327
I'm sorry, sir.
They're still not in.

554
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:41,455
This is cancer
we're talking about.

555
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:45,024
I understand, sir.
You'll have to call back tomorrow.

556
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:55,010
Gimme an espresso,

557
00:41:55,044 --> 00:41:57,740
and don't touch
the lemon rind with your fingers.

558
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:04,386
Hello, Paulie.

559
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,388
What are you
doing here?

560
00:42:06,422 --> 00:42:09,721
The home. It's one
of our outings.

561
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:11,522
So you're still
over there, huh?

562
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,721
They've been very nice,

563
00:42:13,763 --> 00:42:16,823
and your brother's
trying to work out an arrangement.

564
00:42:16,866 --> 00:42:19,994
Is it true
what they're saying?

565
00:42:21,003 --> 00:42:23,494
Who? About what?

566
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:25,268
The ride,
the one that broke.

567
00:42:27,877 --> 00:42:29,970
You need to make
a novena, Paulie.

568
00:42:30,012 --> 00:42:32,742
- Those poor children.
- What are you talking about?

569
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:36,047
You let St. Elzear
go without his hat.

570
00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:38,576
Will you listen to this?
Fuck that voodoo, huh?

571
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:41,522
You cursed your mother,
a blessed nun.

572
00:42:41,557 --> 00:42:43,525
She had it coming.
You both did.

573
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:46,027
I didn't bring
you up like that.

574
00:42:46,062 --> 00:42:48,257
You're a fake.
That's how you brung me up.

575
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:50,288
Fuck the two of you.

576
00:42:53,302 --> 00:42:54,701
Sir, your espresso.

577
00:42:58,441 --> 00:43:02,070
So in keeping with this
longstanding tradition

578
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:05,603
of doing everything
ass-fucking-backwards,

579
00:43:05,648 --> 00:43:07,775
we are gathered here tonight
for the bachelor party

580
00:43:07,817 --> 00:43:10,877
of already-married man
Christopher Moltisanti.

581
00:43:13,956 --> 00:43:16,356
And like I always say,

582
00:43:16,392 --> 00:43:18,587
a man is not complete
till he's married.

583
00:43:18,627 --> 00:43:20,822
Then he's finished.

584
00:43:22,932 --> 00:43:24,797
Chrissy.

585
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:27,598
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
- T.

586
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:44,414
Should we order?

587
00:43:44,453 --> 00:43:47,854
- Yeah, what the fuck are the specials?
- Artie.

588
00:43:52,128 --> 00:43:55,620
I gotta go, Ton'.
The kids.

589
00:43:58,434 --> 00:44:01,301
- Have fun tonight, huh?
- All right.

590
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:05,739
- Specials, gentlemen.
- Pray tell, my good man.

591
00:44:05,774 --> 00:44:09,141
I got lamb tonight, grilled, garlic,
little rosemary.

592
00:44:09,178 --> 00:44:11,112
Rosemary,
I'll eat her.

593
00:44:19,755 --> 00:44:21,916
Hey, T.

594
00:44:21,957 --> 00:44:24,016
You're doing a heck
of a job there, Brownie.

596
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:29,091
This thing with the ride,
the shit with Bobby,

597
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:31,224
you settle it
and you settle it now.

598
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:33,701
And not just 'cause
she's my sister, either.

599
00:44:33,736 --> 00:44:35,704
- Ton', I...
- You put little kids in jeopardy

600
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:38,400
at the hands of some
fucking redneck?

601
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,136
Not to mention you leave Little Paulie
alone to deal with the cops.

602
00:44:41,177 --> 00:44:44,510
I thought he had it
under control.

603
00:44:44,547 --> 00:44:46,515
Let me ask you a question
about the feast.

604
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:48,710
Do we need
negative press?

605
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:50,651
With all the competition
out there

606
00:44:50,686 --> 00:44:52,654
for the entertainment
dollar, DVDs,

607
00:44:52,688 --> 00:44:55,020
the Internet?

608
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:57,150
You're right, Ton'.

609
00:44:59,695 --> 00:45:01,663
What happened to
the regular ride guy,

610
00:45:01,697 --> 00:45:04,131
the guy we used
last year?

611
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:07,465
For what he wanted to charge,
I'm getting killed here, Ton'.

612
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:09,494
When your dad
had St. Elzear's,

613
00:45:09,538 --> 00:45:11,529
it was a cash cow,
and it was easy.

614
00:45:11,574 --> 00:45:13,542
Nowadays, between
paying the church,

615
00:45:13,576 --> 00:45:15,203
these Puerto Ricans now,

616
00:45:15,244 --> 00:45:17,508
my profit's
shrunk to nothing.

617
00:45:17,546 --> 00:45:19,776
If it don't work
as a business, get rid of it.

618
00:45:19,815 --> 00:45:22,750
Not for nothing, but a lot of that feast
goes in your pocket.

619
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:26,844
I got a lot
on my mind, T.

620
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:30,017
- I'm sorry.
- Like what?

621
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:33,256
I had a biopsy.

622
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:35,855
I might have
prostate cancer.

623
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,498
Well, it's a biopsy,
right?

624
00:45:40,536 --> 00:45:43,004
Nine times out of 10,
these things come back clean.

625
00:45:43,038 --> 00:45:46,337
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?

626
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:49,833
And don't work yourself
up into a state like you do, hmm?

627
00:45:49,878 --> 00:45:52,039
I've been
having headaches.

628
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:55,244
I'm afraid maybe the thing
metastasized.

629
00:45:55,284 --> 00:45:57,684
Jesus, will you
listen to yourself, huh?

630
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,383
With all your weird fucking shit about
your body and the germophobias.

631
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:05,189
- You don't know shit yet.
- It's true.

632
00:46:05,227 --> 00:46:08,094
I'd rather face 10 guys
with shivs than something I can't see.

633
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,997
Exactly. You're too
susceptible to the psychics

634
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:13,900
and the dream messages
and dirty fucking toilet seats.

635
00:46:13,936 --> 00:46:15,995
It's a biopsy.

636
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:18,199
Get a grip.

637
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,902
You're right, T.

638
00:46:20,943 --> 00:46:23,969
You know, and negative
thinking can help bring this shit on.

639
00:46:24,013 --> 00:46:28,040
Work something out
with Bobby, huh?

640
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:30,210
And Eddie Lind's coming down
from Pennsylvania with an envelope.

641
00:46:30,252 --> 00:46:32,220
Meet him at the Bing.

642
00:46:32,254 --> 00:46:34,620
You call him,
you set up a time.

643
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,360
There he is,
the bad lieutenant.

644
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,958
Hey.

645
00:46:48,971 --> 00:46:50,836
I sold mine.

646
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:54,172
$300 for the five cases.

647
00:47:02,117 --> 00:47:04,847
Oh, I had a heater
put in the Bloomfield wire room.

648
00:47:04,887 --> 00:47:07,117
Guys were complaining.

649
00:47:07,156 --> 00:47:09,556
Well, good.

650
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:12,355
Yeah, yeah,
that's good.

651
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:21,492
What's new with you?

652
00:47:21,537 --> 00:47:23,801
Copacetic.

653
00:47:36,185 --> 00:47:38,483
"We're with the Vipers."

654
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:46,288
- Fun night.
- Fuckin' A.

655
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,824
"Take it easy.
Take it easy."

656
00:47:50,866 --> 00:47:53,699
10-4.

657
00:47:53,736 --> 00:47:56,899
You remember the look
on the other guy's face?

658
00:47:56,939 --> 00:48:00,136
Oh, the fucking
Grizzly Adams douchebag.

659
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:11,578
Yeah.

660
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:27,569
Dr. Cipolla's service.

661
00:48:27,603 --> 00:48:29,434
I need to talk
to the doctor.

662
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:31,371
- Is this an emergency?
- Of course.

663
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:34,001
Dr. Cipolla's out of town.
Dr. Paglieri's on call.

664
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:36,033
Do you wanna
be connected?

665
00:48:36,078 --> 00:48:38,103
Nah.

666
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:25,426
Hey, buddy boy,
how you doing?

667
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:28,157
Any of the girls
working yet?

668
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:34,664
- Last day already. God, it goes fast.
- Yeah.

669
00:49:34,703 --> 00:49:37,433
St. Anthony's
the week after next.

670
00:49:37,473 --> 00:49:39,998
What's the matter, baby?

671
00:49:42,744 --> 00:49:46,305
Can you believe this? After all this,
she wants to go back on that ride.

672
00:49:46,348 --> 00:49:48,316
She cried
for three nights after.

673
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,716
The ride's closed, baby.

674
00:49:50,752 --> 00:49:53,243
Hey, show everybody
how you can walk.

675
00:49:53,288 --> 00:49:55,256
Come on,
they wanna see.

676
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,757
Okay, show 'em.

677
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:59,590
Show everybody
how you can walk.

678
00:49:59,628 --> 00:50:01,357
Show 'em.

679
00:50:07,469 --> 00:50:10,199
Baby, come here, baby.
Come on.

680
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:13,037
Have some candy.
Look, Cracker Jack.

681
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:17,611
Here you go.

682
00:50:24,052 --> 00:50:26,111
Come on.

685
00:50:38,534 --> 00:50:40,229
Where's our belly?

686
00:50:46,008 --> 00:50:47,532
As you can tell
by this outfit, folks,

687
00:50:47,576 --> 00:50:50,636
I've picked out something
with a little Norwegian flavor.

688
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:53,546
I'd like to play for you
the "Johnny Oslo Shadish."

689
00:50:53,582 --> 00:50:56,073
It's a typical Norwegian
dance, and who could do it better

690
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:58,643
than Bobby and Cissy?

691
00:51:08,797 --> 00:51:11,265
Paulie?
I don't wanna argue.

692
00:51:24,813 --> 00:51:26,644
What are you watching?

693
00:51:26,682 --> 00:51:30,311
The "Lawrence Welk"
program, channel 55.

694
00:51:40,796 --> 00:51:43,492
You want some cookies?
