1
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,057
Gentlemen,
can I get you anything?

2
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:21,069
Orange County
firefighters

3
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:22,971
have called in extra help

4
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:25,636
from the California Department of
Forestry aircraft...

5
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:43,627
Hi, you've reached the Sopranos.
Leave a message. Bye!

6
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:46,790
Stop picking your nose!

7
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:49,061
I'm here.
Call me.

8
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,694
Love you.

9
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,911
Thanks.

10
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:51,358
Good morning.
Anthony Soprano.

11
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:53,864
Yup.
See some photo ID, please?

12
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:10,645
What the hell?

13
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:13,412
This isn't my wallet.

14
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:16,482
Oh no.

15
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:23,656
And this isn't
my briefcase.

16
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:29,961
Last night...

17
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:31,935
I was at a bar across
the street from my hotel.

18
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,336
I must have picked up
the wrong stuff.

19
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:36,772
Well, I'll tell you what:
I'm here,

20
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:38,366
so I'll try
to call the bar.

21
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:40,309
But could you
let me in

22
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:41,869
so I don't miss
the morning session?

23
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:43,574
Gosh, I really can't.

24
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:45,845
Look, I just flew in
from New Jersey

25
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:48,444
and Colonel Colonna,
he speaks at 10:30.

26
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:51,114
I can't let you in
without photo ID, sir.

27
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:53,181
- Security.
- I'm on the list.

28
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:55,317
Sorry.

29
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,952
It's a whole new world.

30
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:04,531
Got a big $87 in cash
to my name.

31
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,969
So his briefcase
is a Bally too?

32
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:10,270
No. I didn't look at the brand
name when I picked it up.

33
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:12,572
It just looked like mine,
that's all.

34
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,170
I gave you that briefcase
for Christmas, Ton'.

35
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:17,943
I know, honey.
I know.

36
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:22,282
His license has a Kingman, Arizona,
address and no phone is listed.

37
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,880
What's in the briefcase?
Did you look?

38
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:27,949
Yeah, of course I looked.
There's a bunch of brochures

39
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:30,859
for solar heating systems.
No company name.

40
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:33,329
He'll get in touch.

41
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:36,595
That was
a great lecture.

42
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:39,296
- Oh, look at this now, look.
- What?

43
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:42,773
- Nothing.
- Try not to worry, Ton'.

44
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:44,604
My whole life's
in that case.

45
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:52,611
Thank you.

46
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:56,110
- Welcome to the Radisson.
- How you doing?

47
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:59,783
I checked out a couple hours ago but I'm
going to need the room back. Soprano.

48
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,194
I am sorry, but we're
completely booked.

49
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,856
- You're kidding.
- I'm afraid not.

50
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:08,661
There's six conventions in town.
You might try the Omni.

51
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,463
Trouble is
I lost my wallet,

52
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:12,799
so how the hell am I going to check
in there without a credit card?

53
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:14,395
You'd face the same
problem here.

54
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,600
Yeah, but I stayed here
as a guest just last night.

55
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:19,371
You couldn't sign on that bill,
you've already closed it out.

56
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,435
Thanks for being
so helpful.

57
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:38,818
Hi.

58
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:40,262
What can I get you?

59
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:44,598
Well, I don't know
if you remember me,

60
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:47,332
but I was in here
last night around 8:00.

61
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:49,533
I was sitting
right over there.

62
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:52,702
I ordered the blackened grouper
sandwich then I canceled.

63
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:55,907
- Said I had pains in my stomach.
- Vaguely, okay...

64
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:59,144
Well, when I was leaving,
I picked up a wallet and a briefcase

65
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:01,617
and I thought they were mine,

66
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,211
- but they weren't.
- Oh, Jesus.

67
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:05,654
You don't happen to remember
who was sitting next to me?

68
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,555
You know,
there was a guy.

69
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:09,492
He was
about your height.

70
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:12,189
You know the reason I remember
is he'd had that grouper sand too

71
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,631
and I was afraid we'd mess the orders
up. I think he left before you.

72
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,726
- And he never came back?
- No.

73
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:22,067
You know the name
Kevin Finnerty?

74
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:24,165
- He drives a Lexus.
- You know him?

75
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,836
It's a joke.
Infinity? Lexus?

76
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:30,077
I imagine you could use
one on the house.

77
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:33,174
Yeah, yeah.
You said a mouthful.

78
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:36,411
- Uh, Scotch rocks.
- All right.

79
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:40,684
- Glenlivet okay?
- Oh yeah, better than okay.

80
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,424
Well, might as well
hang out here

81
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:47,192
in case he shows or calls.

82
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:50,098
You realize I can't even get on a plane
without a picture ID?

83
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:53,126
Oh God, that's right.

84
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,465
Well, tell me
about Costa Mesa.

85
00:07:57,508 --> 00:07:59,066
Nice place to live?

86
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,273
Around here?
It's dead.

87
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:16,956
Give me
the grouper sandwich.

88
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:18,485
You got it.

89
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:22,760
Bag the sandwich.
Come eat with us.

90
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,769
A few of us are getting a table.
Dude lost his wallet and briefcase.

91
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:29,102
- Man. Oh no.
- That's all right. Thanks anyway.

92
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,769
Come on. That tool who took your stuff
shows up, we'll all pound his ass.

93
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:36,238
Okay, thanks.

94
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:45,619
U.S. Drill Bit.
Aerospace and industrial equipment.

95
00:08:45,656 --> 00:08:47,817
We just sold our gear
and coupling unit to Wheela-brator

96
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:50,623
- to focus on pumps and compressors.
- Interesting.

97
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,391
Tony, you never did tell us
how you made the jump

98
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:56,127
from selling patio furniture
to precision optics.

99
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,896
Well, like my wife says,
that's a good question.

100
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:01,463
Excuse me for one minute.

101
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:03,736
Hi Daddy.
I made volleyball.

102
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:07,472
All right! I told you, didn't I?
You were worried over nothing.

103
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:08,979
How's your brother?

104
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:11,811
Mom put him to bed early.
He puked.

105
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:14,443
Oh no.
Is she around?

106
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:16,976
Mom!
Bye, Dad.

107
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:18,318
Bye, baby.

108
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:20,017
Ton', how ya doing?

109
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,958
Finnerty didn't
call there, did he?

110
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:24,621
No. I'd have let you know
right away.

111
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,802
Where'd Jeff
and Kansas go?

112
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:35,431
To bed, and they
sucker-punched you, buddy.

113
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:36,940
They paid the check.

114
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:38,771
You guys all had a hand
in this, didn't you?

115
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,404
Listen, we're just impressed
to be in the presence of a man

116
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:43,744
whose sales team snatched
the brass ring

117
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:45,442
12 consecutive quarters.

118
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:48,452
It's not such a big deal.

119
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:50,477
There's always
a faster gun.

120
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:55,455
I'm 46 years old.

121
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:57,688
I mean, who am I?

122
00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:59,423
Where am I going?

123
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:01,898
Join the club.

124
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:23,319
Now is the time you can
clearly hear His voice.

125
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:26,482
Let us rejoice
in His love.

127
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:40,568
This isn't
going to happen.

128
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:42,232
What are you talking about?

129
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:45,299
I saw your face when you got off
the phone with your wife.

130
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:47,571
So?

131
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:50,672
Don't sweat it.
It's sweet, actually.

132
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:53,878
But you talk about them
back there a lot.

133
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:56,580
I could even be
some other guy tonight

134
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,816
and get away with
the whole shebang.

135
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:01,950
But no,
I blow it.

136
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,090
They're looking
for a perp.

137
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,801
His eyes are open.
Two, three.

138
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:23,336
He's bucking the vent.
Give me the lights.

139
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:25,474
- I'll get some restraints.
- Four milligrams Ativan.

140
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:28,542
He was just lying there peacefully
just like he has been and then he just...

141
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:31,953
- He's still bucking.
- Room three! The gunshot.

142
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:35,016
He pulled his tubes out!

143
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:36,754
I have to retube him.

144
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:39,262
- Oh God.
- Etomidate and sux and an airway box.

145
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,595
- Take the family out.
- Give us room to move.

146
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:43,862
- Please wait outside.
- Where's the Ativan, please?

147
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:45,493
I got him.

148
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:49,632
- Tony.
- Dad?

149
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,575
- Mr. Soprano.
- Tony?

150
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:56,307
- What, honey?
- Who am I? Where am I going?

151
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:58,941
We're right here with you.
Tony, who am I?

152
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:01,611
Get ready to retube him.
Sir, can you hear me?

153
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:03,950
Who am I?
Where am I going?

154
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:06,218
- Dad!
- Tony!

155
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:08,623
I'm going to have to insist
that you guys leave.

156
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:12,060
Getting this breathing tube back in is
something you're not gonna want to see.

157
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:16,599
- What's going on?
- You're just getting back?

158
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:18,625
Matt's car wouldn't start.

159
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:21,103
- Did you eat at least?
- Yeah.

160
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:24,266
Dad's not so good right now.
They made us leave.

161
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:43,216
I got to go.

162
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:46,025
- What's the latest?
- He came out of the coma for a minute.

163
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:48,088
They took
the breathing tube out.

164
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:50,225
That's good, right?
That means he's breathing on his own.

165
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:52,862
They had to put
the tube back in.

166
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:56,532
- Goddamn Junior.
- Anthony Soprano is not going to die.

167
00:12:56,574 --> 00:12:58,940
I don't know what
everybody's talking about.

168
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,807
Nobody's saying
he's going to die.

169
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:03,177
Could one of you take
these guys home, please? 2:00 a.m.

170
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:06,911
You can't live in this ICU Carmella.
Two nights straight is too much.

171
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,942
I'm okay.
Mead spelled me last night.

172
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:12,285
- I'm staying tonight too.
- I want you to go back.

173
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:15,315
Okay, people call the house.
I need somebody there.

174
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,452
Ma, you want some tea?

175
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:21,822
Van Helsing, let's go.

176
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,267
- I'll take him.
- I got it.

177
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:28,295
- He's on my way.
- Bullshit, you live in Bellevue.

178
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:31,001
- What do you care?
- You already brought the sfogliatelle!

179
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,839
Let's go.

180
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:43,318
Got him back on the ventilator,
mucus plug.

181
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:46,653
The bullet didn't just tear up the
pancreas but it impacted the gall bladder.

182
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:50,058
Sepsis is the big problem.
An infection in the blood.

183
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:52,221
I've got him sedated
and restrained

184
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:53,992
so he can't pull his
breathing tubes out.

185
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:56,465
- Okay, then what?
- As we discussed before,

186
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,593
we're probably not looking
at a very good outcome here.

187
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:00,831
Should we call Dr. Plepler?

188
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:03,499
I'll let him know.
And Taschlin too. He'll stop by.

189
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,304
Does he know
that he's dying?

190
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:07,573
We don't know.

191
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:39,232
Welcome to the Omni.
How may I help you?

192
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,296
Name is Finnerty.
I called and reserved a room.

193
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:49,579
Yes, Mr. Finnerty, we have you down
for a single room for the night.

194
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,046
Did you wish to keep
that on the Visa?

195
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,981
Uh, yeah.

196
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:55,611
I'll need to take
an imprint to cover incidentals.

197
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:57,883
Sure.

198
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,201
Room 728.
Elevators are on your left.

199
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:27,517
Have a good night.

200
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,416
Thank you.

201
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:35,448
- Good night.
- Night.

202
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:46,801
Kevin Finnerty?

203
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:49,806
We thought we heard
that man say your name.

204
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,900
How fortuitous we should
meet up with you again.

205
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:56,572
You know him?
This is important.

206
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:59,947
Months you have ignored
our letters and phone calls.

207
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:02,350
Well, we are now
filing suit against you.

208
00:17:02,386 --> 00:17:04,513
No, okay, back up.

209
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:06,386
I'm not Kevin Finnerty.

210
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,218
I have his wallet
by mistake

211
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,161
and I guess I look
a little like him?

212
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:14,096
So he is from around here?

213
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:17,658
We had a horrible winter
at the monastery

214
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:20,067
because of your
heating system.

215
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,901
I'm not Kevin Finnerty.

216
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:23,998
- Lose your arrogance.
- Son of a bitch!

217
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,066
Hey!
Hey, come on guys.

218
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,101
Did you see?
He hit me!

219
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:32,780
Don't let him...
he hit me!

220
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:36,013
- You okay?
- Don't let him go!

221
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:37,748
I was just trying
to block your fall.

222
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:39,449
Did you see that?

223
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,583
Why would I be joking?

224
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,650
He slapped me in the mouth.

225
00:17:43,694 --> 00:17:45,321
Did you file
a police report?

226
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:48,661
I'm staying here
under somebody else's credit card.

227
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:51,793
- You could've explained that.
- Oh, you're so sure?

228
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:54,235
It's fraud.

229
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:57,172
Does the hotel know if there's
a Buddhist temple or anything around?

230
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:58,970
They say there's
more than one.

231
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:01,443
If I could find the place
and I could get some words in edgewise,

232
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:03,207
they might point me
to Finnerty.

233
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:06,512
But who wants more complications?
I just want to come home.

234
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,577
I know. You never even wanted
to go to this conference.

235
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:14,182
I agree. You should just leave tomorrow
and not go on to Houston.

236
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:15,714
I'll wire you cash.

237
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,317
Can I claim the cash
without ID?

238
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:20,387
Shit.
That's a good question.

239
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,923
All right, I'll call Doenitz, see if the
company can help.

240
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:25,902
I miss you.

241
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:30,168
I miss you too, but you're
off in your own world.

242
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:32,368
You're too distracted
with work.

243
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:35,742
This is partly your fault.

244
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:38,043
Call me later
if you can't sleep.

245
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:40,550
Love you.

246
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:42,245
Love you.

247
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:44,720
Good morning.

249
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:50,677
- Mead honey?
- How is he?

250
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:54,952
The same.

251
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:58,826
But another night has passed
and he is still with us.

252
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:04,132
He's not the same.

253
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:08,002
His fever dropped to 39.1. That's
102-point-something.

254
00:20:10,874 --> 00:20:12,774
Oh, Dr. Plepler.
Good morning.

255
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,539
Hear we had a rumpus
last night, huh?

256
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:16,739
Oh, God.
It was awful.

257
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,645
How long since
he left my O.R.?

258
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:21,082
- His amylase is 41.
- Hematocrit still okay?

259
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:23,052
- Yup.
- Good.

260
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:27,855
Hi. How's my big brother
doing today?

261
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,827
Everything's okay here.

262
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:40,769
You mean
just the surgery per se?

263
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:43,432
Well what about the sepsis?

264
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:45,942
Yeah, well that's the concern.

265
00:20:45,976 --> 00:20:48,103
What did Taschlin say
this morning?

266
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:50,511
Dr. Taschlin never came
in here this morning.

267
00:20:50,547 --> 00:20:52,845
Well, no matter.
I'll be talking to him.

268
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:54,851
Go ahead and change
the dressing, huh.

269
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:56,443
Does this mean the chances
could be worse

270
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,045
my husband could not
come out of his coma?

271
00:20:58,088 --> 00:20:59,988
Actually, now
we've induced coma.

272
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:02,218
- He's snowed with Ativan.
- What? Why?

273
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:06,320
Control the seizures while we try to
knock down the fever with antibiotics.

274
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:09,389
It says his temperature's
down some.

275
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:12,163
The problem here is not only

276
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:15,137
are we looking at the obvious
negative outcome,

277
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:17,367
but in these cases

278
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:21,537
we also contemplate
degrees of brain damage

279
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:23,512
in the event
he does survive.

280
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:31,619
- What antibiotic is he on?
- Zosyn.

281
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:36,224
Sorry, Doctor, she volunteered in
an ICU this summer.

282
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,127
Columbia Pres in New York. She's
thinking about a career in medicine.

283
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:42,257
- Oh, good.
- Or law, I don't know.

284
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,166
Good morning, Doctor.
I'm the sister. We met yesterday.

285
00:21:45,202 --> 00:21:46,999
Look, you're all doing
the right thing.

286
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:50,404
You're staying with him,
keeping contact, but talk to him also.

287
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,841
Keep him engaged. You might want
to play some of his favorite music.

288
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:55,708
You know
fortunately for him,

289
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:59,341
he is at a level-one
trauma center.

290
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:01,817
Or with his injuries, believe me,
he would have been dead 12 hours ago.

291
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:04,150
Okay, I see.
Thank you, Doctor.

292
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:06,554
"Thank you, Doctor"?

293
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,218
"I'm sorry, she volunteered
at an ICU"?

294
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,250
You treat these guys
like rock stars.

295
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:14,264
- He's the doctor, Meadow.
- Well why bring up brain damage now?

296
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,027
We'll cross that bridge
if we have to.

297
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:18,296
I came by to help, guys.
Anything.

298
00:22:18,335 --> 00:22:20,360
I left Nica
with Bobby's mother.

299
00:22:20,404 --> 00:22:21,928
You both should get
some rest.

300
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:24,372
Come on in and see him.
Your sister's here too.

301
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,146
Oh my God.
Oh God.

302
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:36,914
I can't get used to this.
Oh my God.

303
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:43,023
- Oh my God. I can't...
- I know, Janice. I know.

304
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,961
Get her some water.
Come here, sit down.

305
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:50,695
- It's okay, it's okay.
- He's my brother!

306
00:22:55,138 --> 00:22:57,572
- What are these?
- A watch and a pencil.

307
00:22:57,608 --> 00:23:00,600
Repeat the following
sentence,

308
00:23:00,644 --> 00:23:02,578
"No ifs, ands or buts."

309
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:04,046
I'll do it if I fucking
feel like it.

310
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:06,049
Take your ultimatums
and stick them in your ass.

311
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,778
No, repeat the sentence.

312
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:10,616
What is this person
talking about?!

313
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:13,214
These people are trying to establish
for the government,

314
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:16,784
that if you shot Anthony
Soprano, which we're not conceding,

315
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:18,658
that it certainly wasn't
intentional,

316
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,629
that you were confused
and disoriented.

317
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:22,962
- Don't coach him, please.
- My nephew Anthony?

318
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,969
- That's why you're here in custody.
- Where's Mel?

319
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:28,870
You dismissed Mr. Melvoin
as your attorney and hired me.

320
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:32,603
Because of his paralyzed hand from
his stroke, it made your nervous.

321
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:35,771
If somebody shot my nephew
it was him himself.

322
00:23:35,812 --> 00:23:37,507
He's a depression case.

323
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:03,970
You got any beefs,
I'm the one you come to.

324
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:06,771
Likewise, weekly I'll
collect for the skip.

325
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,871
I'll keep it for him
until he's back on his feet,

326
00:24:10,914 --> 00:24:12,745
taking out a portion
for Carmela

327
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:15,149
to run the house
and that shit there.

328
00:24:15,185 --> 00:24:16,482
- Good.
- Absolutely.

329
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,216
Anybody got
any questions?

330
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:22,157
For now, not personal questions
relating to yourself,

331
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:23,716
but about the family.

332
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:28,564
- Yeah, Vito.
- The sports book in Roseville.

333
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,998
By rights, that should
go to me now.

334
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:33,628
- Eugene was with me.
- Yo, what'd I just say?

335
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,467
Not about yourself!

336
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:37,439
What do we do about Junior?

337
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:39,567
He's in jail.
That puts him out of our reach.

338
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:41,975
- Not necessarily.
- He's a demented old fuck.

339
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:44,810
I say we do nothing.
Let him rot, sever all ties.

340
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:46,509
End this embarrassment
right now.

341
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,213
He "Marvin Gayed"
his own nephew, the boss of this family.

342
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:52,346
What happens to Junior
is Tony's call.

343
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:54,380
- That's right.
- Bobby,

344
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:57,951
all due respect, where the fuck
were you that night?

345
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:00,896
Why was the skipper
babysitting Junior?

346
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:03,661
I had other
family obligations.

347
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,897
Ask my wife.
Tony volunteered.

348
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:12,638
Are we done?
I'm going back to the hospital.

349
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:27,213
He's gotta make an issue
out of everything lately.

350
00:25:27,257 --> 00:25:30,090
Roseville's been Junior's
territory since the Big Bang,

351
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:33,119
which means it goes to Bobby
now that Junior's out of the picture.

352
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:35,222
Vito already pulls down
more scratch

353
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:37,096
than anybody,
from the unions.

354
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:38,692
Let him go
to the hospital first,

355
00:25:38,735 --> 00:25:41,465
that fat fucking kiss-ass.

356
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:44,531
I'm buying Tony a nice little
stereo for the room.

357
00:25:44,574 --> 00:25:47,168
He don't need that.

358
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,235
Look at this fucking mutt.

359
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,907
Who wouldn't like to take
the easy way out?

360
00:25:54,017 --> 00:25:56,008
Maybe the poor fuck
was suffering

361
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:58,078
from inoperable
cancer or some shit.

362
00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:01,187
Suicide runs in families.

363
00:26:01,224 --> 00:26:03,351
Maybe it was his mother
or his old man

364
00:26:03,393 --> 00:26:06,362
took the gas pipe
when Eugene was a kid.

365
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:08,489
His son,
the drugs maybe.

366
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,900
I knew him better
than anybody, but still...

367
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:17,572
Maybe he was a homo, felt there was
nobody he could talk to about it.

368
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:21,904
That happens too.

369
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,181
Good thing Tony never heard
about him killing himself, at least.

370
00:26:27,217 --> 00:26:30,186
Got enough on his plate.

371
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,618
The nurse told me
she saw AJ.

372
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:34,180
She did?

373
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:37,284
I asked him to bring
Dad's Tony Bennett box set from home.

374
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:46,065
Yeah, it's been
kind of weird.

375
00:26:46,103 --> 00:26:48,867
Would you call it
growing up Soprano?

376
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:51,373
I guess.
I don't know.

377
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:54,002
Come with me.

378
00:26:58,748 --> 00:27:00,909
Hold on there.

379
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,950
What did I tell you?

380
00:27:03,987 --> 00:27:05,648
We were just talking.

381
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:09,181
Don't talk to them.
Say nothing.

382
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:11,023
Where are your father's CDs?

383
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:13,120
- I forgot.
- Oh Jesus God, Anthony.

384
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:16,155
- Everybody is pitching in here but you.
- Thanks, Mom.

385
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:18,531
I wish you would go to class if this
is all you're gonna do.

386
00:27:18,568 --> 00:27:21,366
With my father
in the hospital?

387
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:23,895
Go to the deli on Broad Street.
Get some bagels.

388
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,500
All right? Get enough
for everybody upstairs, an assortment.

389
00:27:26,543 --> 00:27:29,239
And go this way.

390
00:27:35,986 --> 00:27:38,580
Look. Chris just sent
this over.

391
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:41,386
A little stereo.

392
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:51,256
Mead, my God,
I'm telling you,

393
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:56,034
she seems like she's grown up so much.
What she knows.

394
00:27:56,072 --> 00:27:58,540
She will make
a terrific doctor.

395
00:27:58,575 --> 00:28:01,339
I got some CDs
from my car.

396
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:05,978
Oh yes,
you like this one.

397
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:37,642
Anthony, Anthony.

398
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:14,149
Ho, Sheriff
of Nottingham.

399
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:16,516
My kingdom
for a mortadella, huh?

400
00:29:16,553 --> 00:29:19,454
They make a great sandwich here.
No getting around it.

401
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:21,787
What about that disease
you picked up over there

402
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:24,225
in Diarrhea-stan
or wherever the fuck you were?

403
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:27,094
This might be the cure.

404
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,564
Yeah, we're sorry
to hear about Tony.

405
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,329
I got nothing to say
about what happened so...

406
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:35,065
That's not why I asked.
How's he doing?

407
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:37,972
He's fucked up.
You know what I think?

408
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:40,408
I think you don't come
here for the sandwiches.

409
00:29:40,443 --> 00:29:42,206
I think you come
'cause you miss us.

410
00:29:44,314 --> 00:29:48,648
Hey, I can't blame you.
That job you got now must be depressing.

411
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:51,586
- How goes the war on terror anyway?
- Working it.

412
00:29:51,621 --> 00:29:54,351
I heard Fieldcrest reported
a truckload of towels missing.

413
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:56,518
We actually spend a little more of our
time trying to interdict

414
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,153
the financial networks
that fund the terror cells worldwide.

415
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:01,755
- No shit.
- Truck hijacking, narcotics.

416
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:05,234
In fact, if you ever heard
of anything going down,

417
00:30:05,268 --> 00:30:07,065
Middle Easterners,
Pakistanis,

418
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:09,230
you'd be helping a lot
if you picked up a phone.

419
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:12,036
- And called you?
- It's your country too, isn't it?

420
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:15,738
Like I'd know one of these suicide
jerk-offs if he bit me on the the ass.

421
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:19,010
You knew Matoush Zhia.
Hung out at your girlfriend's club.

422
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:21,950
He was a drug dealer,
her friend.

423
00:30:21,985 --> 00:30:25,250
I didn't know shit about his politics
till one of your people told me.

424
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:26,915
Something to keep in mind.

425
00:30:26,956 --> 00:30:29,186
I take that terrorism
shit seriously.

426
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:31,785
And Tony, don't even
get him started.

427
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:04,123
This song was playing
in your car

428
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,754
that entire weekend

429
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:08,730
we all went down
to Long Beach Island.

430
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:13,661
Remember Artie and Charmaine
broke up for the first time?

431
00:31:13,703 --> 00:31:15,330
First of many.

432
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:23,006
She accused him of letting
her drown in the ocean. Remember that?

433
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:24,911
That wave picked her up

434
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:27,473
and slammed her down
on her head in the sand?

435
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:33,279
Oh my God,
her around water.

436
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:39,552
And remember the time that she got
cramps from eating that huge calzone?

437
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:41,393
You had to go in after her.

438
00:31:41,431 --> 00:31:44,298
She almost dragged
you down by your hair.

440
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:50,768
Imagine that.

441
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:53,241
At one time
you had enough hair

442
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:55,938
that a woman could grab it
with both her hands.

443
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:08,950
You're going to be fine, Tony.
I know it.

444
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:11,290
The doctors say
you're going to be fine too.

445
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:19,625
They are very confident.

446
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:21,762
They know that you are really strong.

447
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:24,535
You're strong as a bull.

448
00:32:31,014 --> 00:32:33,380
You know that
that's always gotten to me.

449
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:36,214
When you used to pick
me up and throw me over your shoulder,

450
00:32:36,252 --> 00:32:38,186
oh my God, Tony.

451
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:40,746
You used to get me
so hot down there.

452
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,554
I can feel it right now
just thinking about it.

453
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:53,102
You are going to be
okay, Tony.

454
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:57,072
Your friends,
your kids all love you.

455
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:25,763
A long time ago I told you you were
going to go to hell when you died,

456
00:33:25,802 --> 00:33:28,066
when you had that MRI.

457
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:34,508
And you threw my words back
at me when we got separated.

458
00:33:34,544 --> 00:33:38,139
And you were right.
That was a horrible thing to say.

459
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:40,046
It's a sin,

460
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:42,381
and I will be
judged for it.

461
00:33:45,755 --> 00:33:47,655
You're a good father.

462
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,158
You care about your friends.

463
00:33:56,966 --> 00:33:59,059
Yes, it's been
rough between us.

464
00:34:01,037 --> 00:34:03,631
I don't know, our hearts
get so hardened

465
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:05,766
against each other.
I don't know why.

466
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:17,577
But you are not
going to hell.

467
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:23,988
You're coming back here.

468
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:32,261
I love you.

469
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,615
Mr. Finnerty,
sorry it took so long,

470
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:57,217
but I saw some things
on the CT scan I didn't like,

471
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,491
which is why I ordered
the MRI.

472
00:35:05,435 --> 00:35:06,868
How long have I been here?

473
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:08,894
In looking at your MRI,

474
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:10,906
see these dark areas?

475
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,398
These are parts of your brain that have
been oxygen deprived.

476
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:18,403
Unfortunately, these are consistent

477
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:22,145
- with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's.
- What?

478
00:35:22,185 --> 00:35:24,653
Of course you're going to want to see
a neurologist when you get home,

479
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:28,350
but the radiologist here
has seen the studies and he concurs.

480
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:31,519
Alzheimer's?
I'm 46 years old.

481
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:35,088
- I know.
- What the hell?

482
00:35:38,501 --> 00:35:40,867
This goddamn miserable trip.

483
00:35:40,903 --> 00:35:42,803
The good news is
the treatment picture

484
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,569
isn't quite as bleak
as it would have been a while back.

485
00:35:45,608 --> 00:35:48,577
It's a death sentence.

486
00:35:48,611 --> 00:35:52,274
You're a smurf for 10 or 15 years and
then you die

487
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:54,374
shitting in your pajamas.

488
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:56,180
I know people
with Alzheimer's.

489
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:59,279
Mr. Finnerty, talk
to your own docs back home.

490
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:01,586
My name's not even Finnerty.

491
00:36:01,624 --> 00:36:04,787
I lost my wallet and my briefcase,
and I picked his up.

492
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:08,661
So you guys took out
his insurance card from his wallet.

493
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:11,826
- How's that float your boat?
- Well, what is your name?

494
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:15,031
What does it matter?
I'm not going to know myself soon.

495
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:21,368
You can rest here a while.

496
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:24,710
You're fine other than
the minor concussion.

497
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:27,841
Fall like that could have
broken your neck.

498
00:36:33,322 --> 00:36:35,756
I'm lost.

499
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,692
AJ wanted to come
but he got

500
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:40,161
a really bad stomach flu
from a burrito.

501
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,430
Law firm's being so understanding
about me taking time off

502
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:48,960
from my internship
to be here.

503
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:57,078
Finn's coming out.

504
00:36:57,113 --> 00:36:59,513
He really likes you.

505
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:12,257
I was reading this morning
and I found this.

506
00:37:12,295 --> 00:37:14,991
I want to share it with you.

507
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:18,467
By Jacques Prevert...

508
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:20,469
"Our Father which art

509
00:37:20,503 --> 00:37:24,030
in Heaven, stay there,

510
00:37:24,073 --> 00:37:26,041
and we shall stay on Earth,

511
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:28,635
which is sometimes so pretty."

512
00:37:57,907 --> 00:38:00,034
Look, I took
some Pepto-Bismol.

513
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:25,190
How much do you know
about the Prius?

514
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:30,462
I could've been
naked in here.

515
00:38:30,506 --> 00:38:33,407
You need to familiarize
yourself with hybrid cars, Meadow.

516
00:38:33,442 --> 00:38:36,070
It's important.
This is the conversation of the future.

517
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:38,774
Why are you breaking my balls
about hybrid cars?

518
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:40,840
I don't give a shit.
I've been up all night.

519
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,851
Oh, you're tired?
Poor you.

520
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:44,853
You never give two fucks
about the environment.

521
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:46,616
Is that what's crawling
up your butt?

522
00:38:46,656 --> 00:38:49,181
That I was at the hospital
last night when you told Mom you'd come?

523
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:51,921
I didn't say one word to you
about it and neither did anyone else.

524
00:38:51,961 --> 00:38:54,191
We're all so glad you fucking
kicked your stomach flu, okay?

525
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,925
I saw how you looked
at my plate of food.

526
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:57,592
I can't eat
at my own house?

527
00:38:57,633 --> 00:39:00,602
I wasn't looking at your plate.
It's all in your mind.

528
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:22,681
Don't you find this
completely embarrassing?

529
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:24,022
What?

530
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,426
This, our family.

531
00:39:26,462 --> 00:39:29,363
Our father gets shot
by our goober fucking uncle?

532
00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:32,128
- What is that?
- Yeah, it's embarrassing.

533
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:35,467
I don't want to think
about what Finn's parents are saying.

534
00:39:35,504 --> 00:39:38,905
I mean, I don't really give
a shit about my friends.

535
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:42,877
They know what Dad does, but like,
some of them remember Uncle Junior.

536
00:39:42,912 --> 00:39:45,676
He was always
a fucking mummy.

537
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:48,206
- Why did Dad hang out with him?
- You know Dad.

538
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:51,277
He takes those things
seriously, all the Italian family stuff.

539
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,619
Yeah, I got the big lecture.
Now look.

540
00:39:54,657 --> 00:39:56,625
I know.

541
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,192
Look at these
fucking reporters.

542
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:06,298
Hey!
Fuck you!

543
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:08,337
I'll be glad
to sit with Tony.

544
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:11,397
Hospital rules, it's family
only for now, but thank you.

545
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:17,811
Angie phoned.

546
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:20,873
Guess she's very busy over there
with her body shop.

547
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:24,250
You want some grits?

548
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:26,016
Oh, look who's here.

549
00:40:26,055 --> 00:40:28,819
Hey Fabio, I'm available.

550
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:32,290
So what? Now there's
an actual roster

551
00:40:32,328 --> 00:40:34,353
of who stays with Dad
and when, and I'm not on it?

552
00:40:34,397 --> 00:40:37,127
Frankly, AJ, I didn't think
you'd be interested.

553
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:39,657
I was sick and I've
been trying to study,

554
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:42,762
which is what everybody's usually
hassling me about 24/7.

555
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:45,103
I guess there always
has to be something, right?

556
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:47,507
Come here
and sit down, okay?

557
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:54,713
"Studying."
He goes clubbing in New York.

558
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,743
Well you cut him too much slack.
You still protect him.

559
00:40:58,788 --> 00:41:01,951
I know he avoids Tony because he
can't face seeing him like this.

560
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:04,289
- It frightens him.
- It frightens everybody.

561
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:06,386
He should get a pass?
You know kids his age

562
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:08,329
are getting blown up
in Iraq.

563
00:41:08,364 --> 00:41:10,594
You know something
that's interesting? Janice noticed

564
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:14,228
that when AJ talks about Tony's
possibly not coming out of this,

565
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,703
he can't even use
the word "dad."

566
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:18,332
He says "Anthony Soprano
is not going to die."

567
00:41:18,374 --> 00:41:21,969
Well, that's a fascinating
psychological nugget,

568
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:23,706
but it don't change the fact

569
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:26,044
that if that kid
don't pull his end in this,

570
00:41:26,082 --> 00:41:28,778
he's never going to forgive
himself and nobody else should either.

571
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:32,879
It's just that Tony has
always loomed so large for AJ.

572
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:36,255
Well maybe it's just that AJ is a
selfish boy who doesn't give a shit.

573
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:40,488
I'm sorry your son
is no longer with us

574
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:43,726
but don't use mine as a guinea pig
for your ideas on parenting.

575
00:41:43,766 --> 00:41:45,734
I never saw you
take a hard line.

576
00:41:45,768 --> 00:41:48,430
Why do you think I'm talking
to you like this?

577
00:41:57,513 --> 00:42:01,381
The thing is,
Tony has an open incision.

578
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:04,944
If you are there in the room
and they change the dressing,

579
00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:07,717
it's very hard to take.

580
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:09,987
And I don't know
that AJ should see that.

581
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:27,371
Hey!

582
00:42:28,677 --> 00:42:30,474
Get the fuck
off the property!

583
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:33,573
Hey! I warned you yesterday.
The curb line is your limit.

584
00:42:37,153 --> 00:42:39,314
I know.
I know you hate it.

585
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:43,523
I'm not going to tell
you what to do, Finn.

586
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:47,325
How would you describe your husband's
relationship with his uncle?

587
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:51,458
Were they close?

588
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,559
You know of any issue
they might have been having?

589
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:56,264
I don't speak with Junior.
I haven't for years.

590
00:42:56,305 --> 00:42:59,570
My husband knows how I feel
and he never brought him up.

591
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:01,667
What was
your conflict about?

592
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:04,008
It's not something
I'm going to discuss with you.

593
00:43:04,046 --> 00:43:06,378
Your husband ever talk about
Junior Soprano's mental state?

594
00:43:06,415 --> 00:43:09,578
You're flying
full-fare coach?

595
00:43:09,618 --> 00:43:11,586
I did hear him
telling other people

596
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,418
how Junior was getting
more and more confused...

597
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:17,449
calling my husband Johnny,
which was his father's name,

598
00:43:17,493 --> 00:43:19,654
resisting getting a haircut,
that kind of thing.

599
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:22,926
You spoke with your husband
what time of the night of the incident?

600
00:43:22,965 --> 00:43:24,489
- I... I don't know.
- I'm not bailing.

601
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:26,262
Meadow, could you?

602
00:43:26,302 --> 00:43:29,396
- I'm just trying to understand.
- Understand what?

603
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:32,874
You're coming out from California
to support me with my father being shot

604
00:43:32,908 --> 00:43:36,036
or because dental school
is just sucking for you.

605
00:43:36,078 --> 00:43:37,773
Both.
Is that so awful?

606
00:43:37,813 --> 00:43:41,681
If you have any more questions
you're going to have to call my lawyer.

607
00:43:43,819 --> 00:43:45,343
When he was taken
into custody,

608
00:43:45,387 --> 00:43:47,855
Junior made
pointed references

609
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:52,088
to the McGuire Sisters,
Sam Giancana.

610
00:43:52,128 --> 00:43:55,188
- You mean the Kennedy assassination?
- Yeah.

611
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:56,755
You mean
as related to this?

612
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:00,235
- I had to ask.
- My husband was three years old.

613
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:17,176
Oh, I could sleep
right here.

614
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:43,612
It's all right.
He'll be okay.

615
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:08,920
The Shelby GT 500?
450 horsepower.

616
00:46:08,964 --> 00:46:12,559
Oh baby, and this guy
on campus has one?

617
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:14,865
And the Mustang's not
as expensive as the M3

618
00:46:14,903 --> 00:46:17,599
I used to talk about
getting all the time.

619
00:46:27,383 --> 00:46:30,580
Jennifer, another round
when you get your chance.

620
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:37,215
Chris!

621
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:40,922
Oh, Ahmed.
You guys here again?

622
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:43,090
You ought to put up a tent
on this fucking bar.

623
00:46:43,132 --> 00:46:45,896
How's Tony?
The girl said he was hurt pretty bad?

624
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:49,028
- He's keeping his dick up.
- His uncle did this to him?

625
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:50,902
I was saying to Muhammad,
why the hell...

626
00:46:50,939 --> 00:46:52,531
Not something
we talk about.

627
00:46:52,574 --> 00:46:55,441
Please, give Tony our best
when you talk to him.

628
00:46:55,477 --> 00:46:57,945
I will.

629
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:43,253
Hey, Dad?

630
00:47:47,463 --> 00:47:50,330
I'm going to get
Uncle Junior for this.

631
00:47:50,366 --> 00:47:52,425
Don't worry.

632
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:57,568
I watched since I was little
how nice you were to him.

633
00:47:59,975 --> 00:48:02,535
And he doesn't just get
to do this to you,

634
00:48:03,645 --> 00:48:05,806
put you in here
and get away with it.

635
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:11,282
You're my dad.

636
00:48:13,856 --> 00:48:16,654
And I'm going to put a bullet
in his fucking mummy head.

637
00:48:18,293 --> 00:48:20,955
I promise.

638
00:48:20,996 --> 00:48:23,055
I can't believe
we're not going to like,

639
00:48:23,098 --> 00:48:25,191
do stuff together again.

640
00:48:27,403 --> 00:48:30,065
'Cause we will.

641
00:48:30,105 --> 00:48:32,073
I'm positive.

642
00:48:38,614 --> 00:48:40,275
Hey.

643
00:48:40,315 --> 00:48:42,146
Hey.

644
00:48:42,184 --> 00:48:44,652
How's he doing?

645
00:48:48,123 --> 00:48:50,182
Hi, Dad.

646
00:48:56,832 --> 00:48:58,697
The doctor knows.

647
00:48:58,734 --> 00:49:00,895
The Chinese guy.

648
00:49:00,936 --> 00:49:04,428
He's calling the other guy to get
permission to change the medications.

649
00:49:05,707 --> 00:49:07,902
I'll stay if you want
to pee or anything.

650
00:49:20,622 --> 00:49:23,022
Hi.
How's he doing?

651
00:49:23,058 --> 00:49:25,424
They didn't come back
with the fever medicine yet.

652
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:26,951
I'm so proud of you, AJ.

653
00:49:26,995 --> 00:49:28,860
You can't imagine how much
this means to your father.

654
00:49:28,897 --> 00:49:31,559
Who knows what it means?
He just lies there.

655
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,228
Well, it means a lot to me then,
how about that?

656
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:37,636
Thank you for doing it.
You've helped your family tremendously.

657
00:49:43,378 --> 00:49:46,006
I flunked out of school.

658
00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:48,448
I ended up with a 1.4
for the quarter

659
00:49:48,484 --> 00:49:51,351
and the freshman dean said
there was no point in coming back.

660
00:49:51,386 --> 00:49:54,583
- With your father in a coma...
- I didn't tell Dad.

661
00:49:54,623 --> 00:49:58,024
- Be positive, everybody said.
- My God.

662
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,687
I tried really hard
in philosophy,

663
00:49:59,728 --> 00:50:02,128
- but that professor...
- With your father in a coma!

664
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:09,197
Go have breakfast.

665
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:52,007
Anthony.

666
00:50:54,082 --> 00:50:56,448
Anthony, can you
hear us?
