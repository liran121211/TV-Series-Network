1
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,485
Junior, hey.

2
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,321
Jimmy, how you doing, kid?

3
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,489
How many of these things we gotta go to?

4
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,743
Filone's mom at the kid's funeral,
the way she carried on.

5
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,202
Fucking manners.

6
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:03,290
I want you to know I always thought
you had that right too. You know?

7
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,586
Jimmy, let me tell you something.
Don't worry about what I know.

8
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,891
I was just over to Tony's house.

9
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,102
Oh, yeah? How was he?

10
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,688
He looked...

11
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,690
...tired.

12
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,276
Maybe he's got hypoglycemia.

13
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,321
- Maybe he's depressed.
- What's he depressed about?

14
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,448
He talked to me about it.

15
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,701
- Depression?
- Well...

16
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,745
What do you know about depression?

17
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,833
Nothing, but he sleeps all the time,
he's not taking care of himself...

18
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,752
Top guys have dark moods.

19
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,673
Winston Churchill drank a quart of
brandy before breakfast.

20
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,759
And Napoleon, he was a moody fuck too.

21
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,766
Am I nuts?

22
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,269
A day at the mall in mules
and I'll be crippled for life.

23
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,278
I told Lilliana to put some <i>giambotto</i>
in the microwave for you.

24
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:21,284
How are you fixed for sweat socks?
We'll be by the Sports Authority.

25
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,789
Tony?

26
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,460
I know you're in there!
I know you hear me!

27
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,087
Will you let me sleep?

28
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:36,133
Does your therapist know about this?
Maybe you need more medication.

29
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,760
She's got me on lithium and Prozac.
What else?

30
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,887
Aromatherapy, something.

31
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,723
This is not normal...

32
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,809
...for a healthy adult male
to take to bed like this.

33
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,602
I got a lot on my mind.

34
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,896
Oh, really? Well, move over, then.

35
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,734
Those indictments are
hanging over my head too.

36
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,154
Plus I got the roots
in the pipe to the street.

37
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,825
My best friend, Pussy, has disappeared.
He's probably fucking dead, okay?

38
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,704
This downturn started long before
Pussy Bompensiero disappeared.

39
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,502
If you want me, I will be
at the Paramus Mall...

40
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:17,632
...getting your son a suit
to wear to his first formal.

41
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,184
Carmela, come on!

42
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,852
Sunlight is good for people.

43
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,106
In Alaska, they wear little light hats
so they don't get depressed.

44
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,816
Sorry, Junior.

45
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,320
The Jackson Street Bridge was up.

46
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,071
If you say you'll be someplace...

47
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,240
- ...be someplace!
- Sorry.

48
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,659
Junior, you all right?

49
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,829
Pork-chop boy was here.
That fucking Altieri!

50
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,917
Running his mouth about
the Brendan Filone hit.

51
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,587
Is that what him and my capos
talk about behind my back?

52
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,048
The meeting's adjourned
at the Green Grove.

53
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,592
Chucky and I spoke to Donnie P.,
and the thing...

54
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,844
...it's happening tomorrow.

55
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,096
That quick? Good.

56
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,515
Yeah. Black guys.

57
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,601
It'll never lead back.

58
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,187
They got a <i>pisciatoio</i> in this place?

59
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,191
Look at her like that.

60
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,320
Mariolina gave me my first hand job.
Me and Vincent Miniscalco...

61
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,198
...in the alley behind
the chicken market.

62
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,660
What am I saying at this
poor woman's wake?

63
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,829
I wanted to let you know
so you don't worry.

64
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,707
Everything's taken care of about Tony.

65
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,419
When I was a little kid like that...

66
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,881
...I always used to wonder why
nobody collected prayer cards...

67
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,634
...like they collect baseball cards.

68
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,389
Thousands of bucks for Honus Wagner...

69
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,140
...and jack shit for Jesus.

70
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,477
It's going down at a newsstand
by the medical center.

71
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:01,523
Where he spills his guts on some
fucking shrink's carpet.

72
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,151
Junior, these guys are very, very good.

73
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,781
Donnie Paduana did time with them at Rahway.
And I was very specific.

74
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,576
He's not gonna suffer.
He'll have an open casket, I promise.

75
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,746
Enough! I don't want to hear anymore!

76
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,749
Jesus, Michael, if I delegate, I delegate.

77
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,795
Is that what time it is?

78
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:29,634
There is absolutely nothing on the street
about the big guy, anywhere.

79
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,515
I went to see his family.

80
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:40,228
Angela doesn't know shit, or she
deserves an Academy fucking Award.

81
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,313
His <i>goomar</i> either.

82
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,608
I don't wanna hear no more
talking about Pussy.

83
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:50,113
Mr. Tony, let me take that
robe and wash it for you.

84
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,490
Did I ask you to take the robe?

85
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,207
Jimmy Altieri was in the Bing.

86
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,711
Can't even look him in the face anymore.

87
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,006
If he's wired, it's doing jack shit...

88
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,759
...because all we feed him
is deliberate bullshit...

89
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,636
...till we can, you know...

90
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,639
Don't do nothing about Jimmy.

91
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,726
I don't even know if he's
the guy that flipped.

92
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,813
I don't know nothing no more.

93
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,737
Pussy probably freaked out
and he's lamming it, that's all.

94
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,785
How many times do I gotta say it?

95
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,626
- You want me to drive you somewhere?
- No.

96
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,544
I usually drive you.

97
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,216
- I'm going downstairs.
- What are you gonna do?

98
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,761
I'm gonna get my pants
out of the fucking drier, okay?

99
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,714
- Hello.
- Hi.

100
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,343
Is this yours?
I found it in the yard.

101
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,720
Oh, no. Really?

102
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,350
Thought the Cusamanos were away.

103
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,812
Yeah, they went in Bermuda to play golf.

104
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,816
You're from Italy, aren't you?

105
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,653
- My English is pitiful.
- No.

106
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,697
You speak very good.

107
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,492
Your English is better than my Italian.

108
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,078
<i>Principles of Oral Surgery?</i>

109
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,413
I'm a student.

110
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,209
I'm here as part of a exchange
program between our two countries.

111
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,881
Boy, if my dentist looked like you
I'd stay awake during a root canal.

112
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,341
All right...

113
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,385
...I'll let you study.

114
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,264
Thank you for bring me...
<i>Come si dice "biancheria"?</i>

115
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,641
I don't know how to say in English.

116
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,186
Well, that makes two of us.

117
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,523
Bye.

118
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,653
That's him.

119
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,242
Remember, they don't want
nothing above the neck.

120
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,788
Let's do it.

121
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,291
Whoa.

122
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,674
Doughnuts?
No wonder he can't lose weight.

123
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,176
Where's he going now?

124
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,348
Yo, sir?

125
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,724
- Excuse me.
- What?

126
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,768
Could you pull forward?

127
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,188
- Give me a minute.
- Police department.

128
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,606
Where's your badge?

129
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,858
I said move this piece of shit, now!

130
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,736
Get the fuck out of my face.

131
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,161
We'll have to waste this
motherfucker too?

132
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,540
Let him get his doughnuts.
We'll pop him when he gets out.

133
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,144
Where's he going?

134
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,230
See if he left his motherfucking
keys in the car.

135
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,242
This is fucked up.

136
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,753
No. No.

137
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,839
Jesus, you make a left at the stop sign.

138
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,592
You must be looking at us.
What are you, Ray Charles?

139
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,803
Jesus Christ! How could it
not have gone down?

140
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,139
I know, Junior. I'm sorry.

141
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:12,310
Some civilian got in the way.
Donnie will explain it to us.

142
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,103
I wanted it to be over.

143
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,480
I know.

144
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,523
Junior, mints?

145
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,285
We've been fucking standing
around here forever.

146
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,662
You don't think we got
better things to do?

147
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,915
What the fuck, man?

148
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,628
They'll do it tomorrow.
My personal guarantee.

149
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,422
Let me tell you something, Donnie.
If they don't...

150
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,592
...some hikers are gonna find your
personal guarantee rolled up...

151
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,386
...and shoved up your ass.

152
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,639
Mike, they got blocked in.
There were witnesses.

153
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,849
- Tomorrow.
- What did I just say?

154
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,561
I already talked to them.
I realize it's urgent.

155
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,314
I heard Tony's own mother
wants him popped.

156
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,400
Who the fuck told you that?

157
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,443
I don't know. It's just a joke.

158
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,321
You think that's funny,
a guy's own mother?

159
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,448
Tomorrow!

160
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,283
Fucking A!

161
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,494
All right.

162
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,882
I don't like it.
This fucking guy's big mouth.

163
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,677
- No, he's okay.
- I don't like it!

164
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,513
Next they'll be making jokes about me.

165
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:36,185
Chucky! Tell him to wait a minute.

166
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,647
Yo, Donnie! Hold on a minute.

167
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,818
Hey, Donnie.

168
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,529
Sorry!

169
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,844
Are you still taking the lithium?

170
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:14,724
Lithium. Prozac. When's it gonna end?

171
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,768
We're trying to give
a jolt to your system.

172
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,562
Give it...

173
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,564
...a little kick start.

174
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,399
Why not kick me in the head?

175
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,402
What you're going through
is very painful, I know that.

176
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,405
You get stabbed in the ribs,
that's painful.

177
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,867
This shit, I don't feel nothing.

178
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,077
Nothing.

179
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,706
Dead. Empty.

180
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,253
What else?

181
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,801
- What?
- What were you just thinking about?

182
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,639
This gorgeous piece of cooz...

183
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,893
...next door to Cusamano's.
She's staying there while they're away.

184
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,686
You do feel something?

185
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,857
Don't split hairs with me
because I've had it with you.

186
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:09,111
Like King Midas in reverse,
everything I touch turns to shit.

187
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,616
I'm not a husband to my wife.
I'm not a father to my kids.

188
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:17,328
I'm not a friend to my friends.
I'm nothing.

189
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,458
I don't even know why I come here.

190
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,337
Nothing else to do.

191
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,132
Do you think it would help if you went
someplace to rest up a while?

192
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,427
- You mean like Vegas?
- No, not Vegas.

193
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,597
- A place where you'd be looked after.
- Like a hospital?

194
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:41,519
- With padded rooms and straitjackets?
- No. No straitjackets.

195
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,146
A residential treatment center.

196
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,607
Any idea what my life would be worth...

197
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,610
...if people knew I was
in a laughing academy?

198
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,320
Your life is boxing us in.

199
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,698
I'll take a gun and blow my head off.

200
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,201
If that's what you're saying,
you should be hospitalized.

201
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,494
Oh, yeah?

202
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,831
You get a couple of guys,
come to my house, try it.

203
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,126
All right.

204
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,673
I'm gonna push the Prozac
to 60 milligrams.

205
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,633
Sure, why not?

206
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,232
Hey, is that you?

207
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,860
Ciao!

208
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,445
Look who's here.

209
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,072
I was just talking about you. No kidding.

210
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,449
What are you doing here?

211
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:41,203
Have the class in gum grafting <i>alla scuola</i>.
I just finish.

212
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,791
Let me ask you.
This sandwich, it says it's a "hero."

213
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,544
Why do they call a sandwich "hero"?

214
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,380
- You don't want to eat that.
- No?

215
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,466
Come on.

216
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,593
- What's your name?
- Isabella.

217
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,179
I'm Tony.

218
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,598
- You never went in Italy.
- No.

219
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,726
Why no? You don't want to go?

220
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,480
I guess I just never got off my ass.
Excuse my French.

221
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,773
Your French?

222
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,192
It's an expression.

223
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,613
And where are your people from?

224
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,074
Wait a minute, don't tell me.

225
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,205
- Avellino?
- How'd you know that?

226
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,582
I didn't. I guessed it.

227
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,669
You look like this guy from there.

228
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,296
He came after the earthquake...

229
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,673
...to repair...

230
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,427
How do you say the seat of the house?

231
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,137
I love how you say that.

232
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,473
"Hearthquake."

233
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,475
You are making a joke.

234
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,144
No. No, I'm sorry.

235
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,105
Go ahead.

236
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,608
<i>Fondamenta</i>. Do you understand?
<i>Fondamenta</i>?

237
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:53,818
Foundation.

238
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,697
Foundation, <i>sì</i>. Foundation was cracked,
and he repaired the stone.

239
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:02,243
My grandfather was a stonemason.
He was Avellinese, him and his brother.

240
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,372
You should visit Avellino if your
family come from there.

241
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,251
There isn't too much left because
of the many earthquake.

242
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:15,256
But from the 17th century,
is still there a beautiful palazzo.

243
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,258
<i>Palazzo della Dogana.</i>

244
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:21,554
And there is a place
in the corner of the piazza...

245
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:26,392
...a wine bar. You can sit.
You can see the hills.

246
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,269
And when is spring...

247
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:32,690
...you can smell the blossom
from the lemon trees.

248
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,484
And there is a church with a bell.

249
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:40,322
And they say when it rings,
that means that a baby...

250
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:45,161
...was conceived in the town.

251
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,654
Tony?

252
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,575
Tony?

253
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:29,663
- Are you on medication?
- No.

254
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,123
No.

255
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,171
Tell me more about your...

256
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,757
...dental studies.

257
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,637
I was interested mainly...

258
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,891
...in tumors of the gum and
the soft tissue of the mouth.

259
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,684
Yeah?

260
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,562
Tumors of the gum, huh?

261
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,399
Dad, we're eating!

262
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,531
Hold it, Ma. Anthony?

263
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,407
What does a gentleman do?

264
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,617
In his own house?

265
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,578
A young lady's invited
Anthony to his first formal.

266
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,789
Well, then?

267
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,507
Okay?

268
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,426
Thank you, young man.

269
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,390
Okay.

270
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,600
Tony!

271
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,815
Honey, I told you your mother
was coming for dinner.

272
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:43,112
- Hi, Mom.
- Well, look who's decided to join us.

273
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,614
And with that breath!

274
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,369
You know, I really don't
need that right now, Ma.

275
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,454
Aren't we being sensitive!

276
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,292
Meadow, can you take some
chicken and pass it, please?

277
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:01,088
- Where's Uncle Jun?
- He said he wasn't feeling well.

278
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:05,509
Did you know the average chicken's
feet never touch the ground?

279
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:06,927
That's dicked up.

280
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,013
If I was that young lady...

281
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,432
...and you came and
took me to that dance...

282
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,475
...and used that kind of talk...

283
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,394
...I'd slap your face!

284
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,521
That's right, Ma. Thank you.

285
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,857
Well, the whole world's gone crazy.

286
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:24,737
Some woman in Pennsylvania shot
her children and set her house on fire.

287
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,071
Here we go.

288
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,658
How come my son's in a bathrobe?
Is he sick?

289
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,827
- He's fine.
- Dad, you're depressed.

290
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,329
Depressed?

291
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:38,334
My father came to this country
with 17 cents in his pocket...

292
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,586
- ...and he never made a peep.
- Ma?

293
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,922
What's he got to be depressed about?

294
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,966
Nobody threw him into the glue factory...

295
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,886
...and sold his house out
from underneath him.

296
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,930
We all agreed to sell your home.

297
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,223
I'm going back upstairs.

298
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,517
I was making a joke!

299
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,356
I suppose it would be better
if I never opened my mouth.

300
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,650
How can it be a joke if you're crying?

301
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,027
This is really the last time.

302
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,614
I am never coming back to this house.

303
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,672
What a day! With this wind, huh?

304
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,715
What you looking at?

305
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,634
Nothing.

306
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,396
Who's she?

307
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,900
Dental student, from Italy.

308
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,444
You know her?

309
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,906
We had lunch.

310
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,659
Lunch?

311
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,497
You fucking piece of shit.

312
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,084
Going to dinner with you is
a distant memory for me...

313
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,170
...but you have time
to take her to lunch?

314
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:11,385
You're sinking this whole family into
your misery with your complaining...

315
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:15,597
...while I spoon-feed you and bathe you!

316
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,351
A half-inch of another woman's
thigh gets you out of bed?

317
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,770
What am I, a fucking idiot?

318
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:26,525
If I had an ounce of self-respect,
I would cut your dick off!

319
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,076
I was there last night for dinner.

320
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,162
I couldn't go.

321
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,913
Those poor freaking kids.

322
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:44,418
They barely have a father now.
You should see him at the dinner table.

323
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:48,088
- I don't want to know.
- In his bathrobe at 7 p.m.

324
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,716
Some bargain.
That's all anyone should pay.

325
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:54,928
My cousin, Cakey, after his lobotomy,
looked exactly like my son.

326
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,639
- Livia.
- Empty. A shell.

327
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,769
Better Cakey die than live like that.
That's what his mother used to say.

328
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:06,065
Don't talk about it anymore.
Don't talk about Tony. It's done.

329
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:32,424
Mr. Tony, Miss Carmela said to tell
you she went to buy a suit for A.J.

330
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,469
Go away.

331
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:40,265
Okay, mister. Miss Carmela told me
to remind you of your appointment.

332
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,800
How's you doing, Tony?
Pick Six today?

333
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:18,720
No, just an orange juice
and a racing form today.

334
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,770
- This wind, huh?
- Yeah.

335
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,232
Dead now, motherfucker!

336
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,072
Oh, shit!

337
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,351
Daddy! Where is he?
Please let him be all right!

338
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,728
- They didn't say anything?
- They didn't.

339
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,815
Look who's here.

340
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,152
Is he all right? Jesus Christ, Tony!

341
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,280
Your ear's all bloody!
What'd they do to your ear?

342
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,325
I'm putting in stitches
to create a nice closure.

343
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,035
We were so scared.

344
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,828
They almost killed you for a car!

345
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,165
Guess nobody told them
about the gas mileage it gets.

346
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,459
It's not funny, Dad.

347
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,838
What's the matter? Forget how
to talk because I got banged up?

348
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,675
- No.
- He's just frightened, that's all.

349
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,552
Doctor needs to finish up here, ma'am.

350
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,722
All right.
Let's give the doctor some room.

351
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,308
See you later.

352
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,522
- Poor Dad.
- He'll be all right.

353
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,693
Christ!

354
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,614
You can't wait until they finish
sewing my ear back on?

355
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,868
One inch to the left and you're
in a drawer instead of talking to me.

356
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,704
Who's talking to you?

357
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,789
What's he doing here?

358
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,708
Agent Harris is just leaving.

359
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,377
We're offering your husband full immunity...

360
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,546
...in return for his testimony.

361
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:01,466
Relocate you and your family,
you'll be completely safe.

362
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,843
Don't talk to my wife.

363
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,594
He wouldn't have to go to jail?

364
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,472
Carmela, ask this prick
if I'm even indicted.

365
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,684
This assassination problem
is not going to go away.

366
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,395
I told you to stop talking to my wife!

367
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,355
Carmela, will you wait outside?

368
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,648
Kiss my ass, Tony!

369
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,527
We're your only option, Tony.
It's not safe for you anymore.

370
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,739
- This conversation's over.
- What do you know?

371
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,824
He knows nothing. It was a carjacking!

372
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,744
Now get out of here!
You're upsetting my wife!

373
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,163
In case you change your mind.

374
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,505
- You know he's right.
- Nothing will happen.

375
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,134
Wake up, Tony! It already did!

376
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:47,763
I took an oath, Carmela.

377
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,765
Are you a kid in a tree house?

378
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,225
Did you tell anybody
about me seeing Melfi?

379
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,937
That's why they tried to kill you,
because you see a psychiatrist?

380
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,565
It was a carjacking!

381
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,442
Have the decency not to lie to me.

382
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,820
What do you want to do, Carmela?
Move to Utah?

383
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,906
Be Mr. and Mrs. Mike Smith?

384
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:10,285
We could sell Indian relics.
Maybe start a rattlesnake ranch.

385
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:14,539
This is our chance to get out, Tony.
We could start a whole new life.

386
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,293
Have some Mormons over to dinner.
Eat some tomatoes with no taste.

387
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,754
I want those kids to have a father.

388
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,756
They got one. This one.

389
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:26,760
Me. Tony Soprano.
And all that comes with it.

390
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,470
Oh, you prick!

391
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,809
Good.

392
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,399
I can't go to that dance now either.

393
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,401
God, self-involved much?

394
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,409
- It's Uncle Silvio and Uncle Paulie.
- Hey, squirt!

395
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,912
- They shot my dad.
- He's all right, though, isn't he?

396
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:58,375
Take more than a Jamaican bobsled
team with cap guns to stop him.

397
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,168
- Where is he?
- With Mom.

398
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,670
All right.

399
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,513
They look kind of weird.

400
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,603
I don't believe it was a carjacking.

401
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,279
<i>Today in Montclair, Anthony Soprano...</i>

402
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:31,491
<i>...who allegedly is a captain
in the northern New Jersey Mafia...</i>

403
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,828
<i>...was wounded in what he claims
was an attempted carjack.</i>

404
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,208
<i>But sources in the FBI say it was
a gangland execution gone awry.</i>

405
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:44,212
<i>Soprano escaped with minor wounds
and was taken to an undisclosed hospital.</i>

406
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,258
<i>One of his assailants,
William "Petite" Clayborn...</i>

407
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,302
<i>...was killed in the attack.</i>

408
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,221
<i>Continuing now with...</i>

409
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,515
Is this true?

410
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,559
Do you think they made it up?

411
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,645
But how could this happen?

412
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,732
I don't know. I don't frigging know.

413
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,777
I feel like I'm floating in space.
He'll look for who did this.

414
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,779
Anthony? Of course he is!

415
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:14,618
- You understand what's going on?
- My son got shot and he got away!

416
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,580
What do we do now?
What the fuck do we do now, Livia?

417
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,373
- We go see him.
- Tony?

418
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,375
Of course!

419
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,629
He's my only son.

420
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,633
Thanks, sweetheart.

421
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,426
We could use some peppers out here.

422
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,636
I'll get them.

423
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,638
Don't you have homework to do?

424
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,723
I can't help too?

425
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,434
Some fucking shit, huh?

426
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,896
Tony! Jesus fucking Christ!

427
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,149
Who do we blame for the hat?

428
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,109
I was on Denny Najarian's boat.

429
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,530
Two shooters, and his piece
was under the seat.

430
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:55,200
- You believe it?
- Two girls from the 'hood, that's all.

431
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:59,538
- Do we know who they are?
- The live one took off in a Taurus.

432
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,207
- Taurus?
- Yeah.

433
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:06,336
Moolies in a new Taurus.
Doesn't exactly fit the profile.

434
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:11,091
Motherfuck! These guys I had
a beef with at the newsstand.

435
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,677
- You were there?
- The day before yesterday.

436
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,638
The newsstand? The one in Montclair?

437
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,349
Yeah, I was in the neighborhood.

438
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,892
What were you doing there?

439
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,353
Taking my mother to the doctor.

440
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,400
Hey, put it right there, baby.

441
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,318
Thank you.

442
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:35,490
This husband of yours, Carmela.
How much we love him.

443
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,659
- He's the best.
- Come on.

444
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,828
He's like a father to me.

445
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,248
Just make sure nothing happens to him.

446
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,587
I'll get it.

447
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,673
Come on.

448
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,676
All due respect, Tone...

449
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,387
...it had to be your uncle, right?

450
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,265
Well, why fucking now?

451
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,350
Maybe he found out.

452
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,810
Found out what?

453
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:09,149
That he's Joe Jerk-off, not the boss.
That you run things behind his back.

454
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,358
Anthony!

455
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,360
Uncle Jun!

456
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,363
Don't get up. I heard
your knee was fucked up.

457
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,699
Don't worry, I'm all right.

458
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,035
- Your ear's disfigured.
- It's all right.

459
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,203
Hi.

460
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:27,375
Mikey and my crew are cracking
heads to find out who did this.

461
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,379
When we're done with them they're
gonna wish they were never born.

462
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,550
Look who it is. Father Intintola!

463
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,218
I came as a friend.

464
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,262
- How are you, Tony?
- All right.

465
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:44,392
If you'd like to speak privately
we could kneel in prayer or...

466
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,852
Not right now.

467
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,606
Why don't you grab a sandwich
and we'll talk later?

468
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,734
- You're sleeping over, right?
- Can I get you anything?

469
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,611
- Another sambuca?
- I'll get it.

470
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:58,239
I'll take a curaçao, if you got it.
I'll buy him one too.

471
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,825
No, that's all right. No alcohol for me.

472
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,744
Can he hear through that ear?

473
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:07,415
Ma, sit down. Here you go.
Have something to eat.

474
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,338
Want some?

475
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,298
Fuck, I thought it was him.

476
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,176
But there he is, glasses and all.

477
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,264
Don't eat <i>capocollo</i>, Grandma.
It's all fat.

478
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,433
<i>Capocollo</i>? Over here!

479
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,437
Right there.

480
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,064
Who is that?

481
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,440
Who?

482
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,110
- That girl.
- Who, Meadow?

483
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,112
Is that Concetta?

484
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,280
It's your granddaughter. Meadow?

485
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,659
All right, don't get impatient.
I'm your mother!

486
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:46,830
Did you hear? Dad fought off
two black guys. One got shot.

487
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,499
Why aren't you dressed for the dance?

488
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,501
- I can't go.
- Why not?

489
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:52,877
Don't you need me here?

490
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,630
And disappoint the future
Miss New Jersey?

491
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:58,133
Mom was gonna drive. She can't now.

492
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,135
You're gonna go.

493
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,397
I gotta know something.

494
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,525
And I want the truth.

495
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,823
Did you ever tell anybody
about you and me?

496
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,203
I may have mentioned to my family...

497
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:11,664
...that I had a patient who was
in trouble with something...

498
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,375
...we were hearing about in the news.

499
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,713
I never mentioned a name
or any other specifics...

500
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,258
...that could identify you
as that person.

501
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,773
My son's.

502
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,821
Does your family know?

503
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,369
My mother's made a few comments.
But I don't see how she knows.

504
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,246
And even if she did...

505
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,711
Don't even go there about the old lady.

506
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:05,093
You should've seen her at my house.
She was losing her mind.

507
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,390
How are you doing with all of this?

508
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,062
I feel pretty good.

509
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,605
- Really?
- Yeah.

510
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,440
Well, that's good.

511
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,110
Talk about a jolt to the system.

512
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,570
Try getting shot at.

513
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,364
It'll give you a nice kick start.

514
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,331
You know, when I was depressed...

515
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,626
...I said I didn't want to live.

516
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,132
Well, I tell you something.

517
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,385
I didn't want to die.

518
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:51,639
Every fucking particle of my
being was fighting to live.

519
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,731
I had lunch with that girl next door.

520
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,274
You did?

521
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,318
Isabella.

522
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,780
She was telling me about...

523
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,743
...Avellino, where my people are from.

524
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,870
It sounded nice.

525
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,165
Anyway, she was talking...

526
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,584
...and then all of a sudden...

527
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,759
...we went to another place, like...

528
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,136
...in my mind's eye.

529
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:34,933
I don't know, we went back in time to,
like, 1907 or something.

530
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,771
And we were in this room, me and her.

531
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:46,486
And she was holding a baby on her breast.
She was nursing it.

532
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:50,156
She was whispering to it, like,
"It's okay, little baby.

533
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,784
Don't cry. It's gonna be okay.

534
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,786
I love you."

535
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,374
Did the baby have a name?

536
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,876
She was calling it Antonio.

537
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,547
Anthony, your fantasy...

538
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,258
...that's you, that little baby.

539
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,470
And Isabella, that she was nursing you.

540
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,815
Fuck me.

541
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,523
You think this is a stretch?

542
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,458
Can we get some of that whiskey?

543
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,007
Livia.

544
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:34,093
You don't knock?
I could've been in the nude!

545
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,636
What the hell is going on?

546
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,931
- See if my slipper is over there.
- Fuck your slipper!

547
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,476
I don't like that talk!

548
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,603
What was that bullshit yesterday?

549
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,773
You don't even recognize
your granddaughter?

550
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,488
I've been forgetting things lately.

551
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:57,742
You'll find that it'll happen
to you soon too.

552
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,871
Terrific timing, after the move
on your son is in the toilet!

553
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,749
I don't know what you're talking about!

554
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,097
Hey, Cuse!

555
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,765
Cuse!

556
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,102
How was Bermuda?

557
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,146
Jeanie wrecked up a motorbike.
Hurt her ankle bad.

558
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,357
- Oh, yeah? I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

559
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,360
So where's your dental student?

560
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,529
My what?

561
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,240
Isabella. Haven't seen
her in a couple days.

562
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,869
Your houseguest, Isabella.
Dark hair, beautiful.

563
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,957
You don't know what I'm saying?

564
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:49,210
Tony, I got no idea what you're saying.

565
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:53,214
You didn't have an Italian girl?
She's here studying...?

566
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:57,218
We had Skippy Palumbo from down
the street take care of the dog.

567
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,222
Never mind.

568
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,724
Forget it. Joke.

569
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,270
- I'll talk to you later.
- All right.

570
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:17,738
You sure about this?
You're not pulling my leg?

571
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,450
What am I, an idiot?
Of course I'm sure!

572
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,786
- You never...?
- No!

573
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:29,375
I think I've said enough about it.
I never threatened to cut your dick off.

574
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,681
- Hello?
- <i>Yeah, it's your patient.</i>

575
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,601
The one who's been involved
in the news lately?

576
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,686
- <i>I gotta talk to you.</i>
- What's wrong?

577
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:52,231
- There was no Isabella.
- <i>What?</i>

578
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,194
There was no Isabella.
I just talked to Cusamano...

579
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,654
<i>...he just got back from Bermuda.</i>

580
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:03,326
I asked, "Where's the dental student?"
He looked at me like I was <i>pazzo</i>.

581
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,829
But you said that your wife saw her,
that you argued about it.

582
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,081
Yeah, I asked her about that.

583
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,209
- And?
- <i>You thought she was pissed then?</i>

584
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,296
You should see her now
that I said it was a fantasy.

585
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,590
Discontinue the lithium.

586
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,091
I already flushed it.

587
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:23,471
Even if it was the medicine,
this fantasy of yours has meaning.

588
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:28,476
You know, the issue of mother and child.
The Madonna.

589
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,561
<i>You didn't see this broad.</i>

590
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,273
<i>Did you ever flirt or come on
sexually with Isabella?</i>

591
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,067
- No.
- <i>Why not?</i>

592
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,278
You said she was very
beautiful and voluptuous.

593
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,529
<i>Another question:</i>

594
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,114
Why now?

595
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,116
- What?
- <i>Why the need...</i>

596
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,161
...for the fantasy of a loving woman now?

597
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,582
- I don't know.
- <i>Come in.</i>

598
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,292
We can talk face to face.

599
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,294
I can't right now.

600
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:59,215
Your mother is always
talking about infanticide.

601
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,384
It's a sad situation in the world.

602
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:05,513
- Do you still feel okay?
- I feel pretty good, actually.

603
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,850
When I find out who shot at me,
I'll feel even better.
