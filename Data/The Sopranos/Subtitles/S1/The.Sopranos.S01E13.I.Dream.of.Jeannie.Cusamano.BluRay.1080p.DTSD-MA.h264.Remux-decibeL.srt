1
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,104
We know what we're gonna do.

2
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,565
Till the government indicts, anyway.

3
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,028
Jimmy! This answers your concerns?

4
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,697
I think a lot of good ground was covered.

5
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,076
Okay, I guess that's it.

6
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:17,054
- You gotta get the tickets.
- I got them already.

7
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,681
Fuck! The Rangers are gonna lose anyway.

8
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,559
You're right, it's him.

9
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:27,856
He asks for a meeting to discuss shit
we covered. He's wearing a wire.

10
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,734
You got my okay.

11
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,987
Send a message to everybody else.

12
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,322
All right.

13
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,700
See you later.

14
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,923
Who told me you hated
the fucking Russians?

15
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:57,761
The pricks Junior brought to pound
my ass were Russian. I was bitter.

16
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,098
Tony's <i>goomar</i> is Russian,
you couldn't ask for a nicer person.

17
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,851
- These two are friends of hers.
- I got enough cologne on?

18
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:08,021
Smells like Paco Rabanne
crawled up your ass and died.

19
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,358
Easy for you to say.
I don't get young ones.

20
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,860
You'll be glad I got you out of bed.

21
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:18,073
Russian boo-boos, you go for some
foreplay, they'll detail your car.

22
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:24,079
- How's the hygiene over there?
- I don't know. This is here.

23
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,748
You didn't let me put anything decent on.

24
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,250
Here we are.

25
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,090
Baby, how are you?

26
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,260
- Is Tatiana here?
- I'll go get her.

27
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:44,474
- You are Jimmy?
- Yeah, that's right, I'm Jimmy.

28
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,190
My man!

29
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,071
Big tits, little feet.
A hit in any man's league.

30
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,536
Have a seat.

31
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,507
Punk-ass pieces of shit!
You forget I'm a captain?

32
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,761
Why don't you call for help
on your radio mike, you rat!

33
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,846
- Mother of God!
- What's wrong?

34
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,681
Not wearing one tonight?

35
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,850
No time to put on anything decent.

36
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,268
God!

37
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,357
Get the piano dolly.

38
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,284
Come on, stop, I want to watch.

39
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,663
<i>Kiss me!</i>

40
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,916
Oh, Georgia O'Keeffe.

41
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,878
Was that your back gate?

42
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,090
It's probably nothing, come here.

43
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,551
People always say that in these movies.

44
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:06,723
Last thing I need is your dad comes
home, sees my Dominican ass.

45
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,685
- Settimia!
- Jesus fuck!

46
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,733
I just saw my grandmother.
How'd she get here from her nursing home?

47
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,658
Settimia!

48
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,080
Cakey!

49
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,916
Tell my sister to open the door!

50
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,418
Grandma, it's me! Anthony Jr.

51
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,506
You've got whooping cough!
Get yourself under the vaporizer!

52
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,341
Holy shit.

53
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,262
What do you want?

54
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,597
Go away!

55
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,475
I will never speak...

56
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,271
...another word to you again, Settimia.

57
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,649
Aunt Settimia's dead.
It's me, Meadow.

58
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,734
<i>Faccia brutta!</i>

59
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,405
Grandma, it's Meadow, remember?
Come sit down.

60
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,117
Yes. Meadow.

61
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,538
Oh, I can't stay in this house,
honey bunch.

62
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,624
Not while that <i>faccia brutta's</i> in here.

63
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,044
Come on, let's go see who it is.

64
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,092
Evening. How are we?

65
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,137
Make my sister get out of the house.

66
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,474
It's 1 a.m. Why were you walking
on Mountain Avenue at this hour?

67
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,226
Shut up.

68
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,438
We got a complaint from your neighbors.

69
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,856
She's my grandmother.

70
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,274
Hi, Grandma.

71
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,153
- Hi!
- Ah, shit!

72
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,866
- You know this young man?
- Of course, he's...

73
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,496
He's my grandson.

74
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,665
And is this your house, dear?

75
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,883
Where was she trying to get to?

76
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,093
Schrafts.

77
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,431
She's being retested.

78
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,849
For Alzheimer's.

79
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,393
It's been a long odyssey
with your mother.

80
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,813
Oh, these last 500 years
just seemed to race by.

81
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,109
Listen to me.

82
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,694
It's okay.

83
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,864
Let it out.

84
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,034
They're transferring her
to the nursing unit.

85
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:36,039
Which is the thing that she
dreaded and feared.

86
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,751
Isn't it interesting how this
memory loss has cropped up...

87
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,214
...right after you failed to be
killed in the carjacking?

88
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,549
You think it was a carjacking?

89
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,385
Of course not.

90
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,556
But I got an idea who
was behind it, and...

91
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,267
Enough said.

92
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,561
You don't want to go there.

93
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,064
- Maybe you don't want to go there.
- What?

94
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,983
Well, let's track it.

95
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,861
Around the time of the shooting,
you were having hallucinations...

96
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,698
...of that Isabella figure.

97
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,118
The protective, loving mother.

98
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,579
Your subconscious was shouting
something at you.

99
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,041
The day before the shooting...

100
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,921
...you said that she kept going on
about news stories...

101
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,008
...of mothers throwing
their babies out of windows.

102
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,844
Why don't we put our cards on the table!

103
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:35,640
You think my mother tried to have me
whacked for putting her in a home?

104
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,811
In your worst dreams,
a duck flies off with your penis!

105
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,106
- Castration.
- My mother never went after my basket.

106
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,442
No, not literally.

107
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:50,238
Look, ordinarily a patient is helped
to make his own breakthroughs.

108
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:55,493
But your life is in danger, so I'm
willing to put the cards on the table.

109
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,913
I say what your mother has,
at the very least...

110
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,791
...is borderline personality disorder.

111
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,918
Borderline personality disorder?

112
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,422
Let me read to you from the DSM-IV, okay?

113
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,258
Definitions of the condition.

114
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,637
"A pattern of unstable relationships.

115
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,432
Affective instability."

116
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,604
It means intense anxiety, a joylessness.

117
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,232
Their internal phobias are
the only things that exist.

118
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,235
The real world, real people are peripheral.

119
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,614
These people have no love or compassion.

120
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:37,077
Borderline personalities are very
good at splitting behavior...

121
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,246
...creating bitterness and conflict...

122
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,999
...between others in their circle.

123
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,710
You twisted fucking bitch!

124
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,506
That's my mother, not some fuck
in Attica, stab you in the shower!

125
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,840
Relax.

126
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,718
We're through, you and I.
We're finished.

127
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,846
You're lucky I don't break
your face in 50,000 pieces!

128
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,348
Okay.

129
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:19,202
Jackie's work killed him.
All that <i>agita</i> brought on the disease.

130
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,705
His reign was peaceful.
This shooting with Tony...

131
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,208
Suppose Jackie hadn't died of cancer.

132
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,752
Who knows how his life would've ended?

133
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:32,549
Look at Angie Bompensiero.
A fucking shell since Pussy disappeared.

134
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:38,221
Ladies! Compliments of the house.
<i>Bucatini amatriciana.</i>

135
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,932
You want a pair of hippos
to walk out of here?

136
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,809
That's imported <i>pancetta</i>!

137
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,896
Will you hate me if I say I like it here
better than the old Vesuvio?

138
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,733
A few bugs to be ironed out.

139
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,319
The one in your salad
was a freak occurrence.

140
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,906
My produce man, he's the most
expensive in the area.

141
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,409
Insurance really came through!

142
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,910
Yes, it did.

143
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,955
Carm, what'd I hear about Tony's mom?

144
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,915
It looks like Alzheimer's.

145
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,959
- Oh, boy!
- Yeah.

146
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,462
I've known Mrs. S since...

147
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:16,134
She's always been an individualist,
should we say?

148
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,387
But she's a real pistol,
what a character!

149
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,559
- Poor Tony.
- Yeah, he's beside himself.

150
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,936
He's got a lot on his plate.

151
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,064
The attempted carjacking...

152
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,483
Hey, well...

153
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,278
I'll let you eat.

154
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,947
- Enjoy!
- Thanks, Artie.

155
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,621
Oh, my God, look who's here!

156
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:49,876
What? You hiding back here?
Your best friend's on table 12.

157
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,587
When are you gonna bury the hatchet?

158
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,298
Arthur, I love Carmela like a sister.

159
00:11:55,465 --> 00:12:00,094
We just don't want this place
to become another Mob hangout.

160
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:05,058
A certain amount of that kind
of patronage creates buzz.

161
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:09,479
Artie, that kind of buzz
we should avoid in droves.

162
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,948
First time here?

163
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,824
Gift from the Dellacrocces.

164
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,576
Artie's opening promotion.

165
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,746
- You will not believe the food!
- That's what I hear.

166
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,457
They'd have to be doing
something special...

167
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,168
...to trump you two ladies
at the spice rack.

168
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,672
I was over at Carmela's
the other night, Ro.

169
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:39,842
We had some <i>zabaglione</i> that,
of course, we did make it together...

170
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,262
...but everybody was raving about it!

171
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,806
Please, you made it, basically.

172
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,476
I wish Tony had taken me up
on my offer to talk to him...

173
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,020
...about the carjacking that day.

174
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,689
That makes two of us.

175
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,568
Well, I'd better get seated and order.

176
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,321
Why don't you stay here, take a load off!

177
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,740
How's the watch, Father Phil?

178
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,200
Oh, it's fantastic.

179
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,830
I can set one of the dials
to the millennial countdown.

180
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,541
- I haven't done it yet.
- Is that Jackie's watch?

181
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,626
Yeah, it is.

182
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,925
Thanks again, Ro.

183
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,702
Mr. Soprano was kind
enough to come with us.

184
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,288
You threatened to wait
till my kids got home.

185
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,876
Agent Harris explained that there's
something we'd like you to hear.

186
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,171
The Springsteen box set.
I already got it!

187
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,132
- You know Agent Grasso.
- Yeah, how you doing?

188
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,842
Have a seat.

189
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,934
As we both know, there's
been an attempt on your life.

190
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,478
You have enemies.

191
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:18,691
It's a safe assumption that you may
have run out your string in Jersey.

192
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,112
The lovely Agent Harris and I have
had this conversation. I'll pass.

193
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,114
You haven't heard the tape.

194
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,909
Play it.
I don't give a fuck what's on it!

195
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:33,498
I understand you and Agent Grasso had
a colloquy about our shared heritage.

196
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,124
Colla-who?

197
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,085
You and I are not <i>compari</i>.

198
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,588
You on the one hand,
me and Agent Grasso on the other.

199
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,842
Even though our ancestors all hail
from the same sunny peninsula.

200
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,470
What the fuck is your problem?

201
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,474
But we do share some cultural ideas:

202
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:55,186
Religious, culinary...

203
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,105
...matriarchal.

204
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,816
Maybe we can motivate you to testify.

205
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,444
Get the kumquats out of your
mouth and get to the point.

206
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:14,163
<i>Boy, Anthony must've really gotten
under your collar. Admit it.</i>

207
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,834
<i>You're looking to crack his</i> coglioni
<i>for putting you in here.</i>

208
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,086
<i>I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

209
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:24,048
<i>Yeah, and I'm playing
shortstop for the Mets.</i>

210
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:29,554
<i>A psychiatrist. He's been
seeing one for a while now.</i>

211
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,558
<i>God only knows what he says.</i>

212
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,768
You wired Green Grove.

213
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:41,107
It was my idea. Everyone else
thought it was a waste of money.

214
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:47,071
<i>My cousin Cakey, after his lobotomy,
he looked exactly like my son.</i>

215
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,909
<i>Empty, a shell. Better Cakey
had died than go on living like that.</i>

216
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,996
<i>That's what his own mother
always used to say.</i>

217
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,801
<i>What are you talking about,
meetings? Who, Livia?</i>

218
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:13,347
<i>All of them! Raymond. Larry.</i>

219
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,601
<i>Three of my</i> capos <i>have
their mothers here?</i>

220
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:21,063
<i>If this is true, Livia, I mean,
I'm the boss, for Christ's sake!</i>

221
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,942
<i>If I don't act, blood or no...</i>

222
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,736
<i>I have to!</i>

223
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,844
Mrs. S!

224
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,972
How are you?

225
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,184
You remember me?

226
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,606
- Arthur Bucco?
- That's right!

227
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,441
Victoria's boy!

228
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,984
That's right.

229
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:12,114
Yeah, you and my Johnny used
to play Little League together.

230
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,618
No! Johnny was your husband.

231
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:20,248
But you're right about the Little League,
that was me and Tony!

232
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:25,586
My son. That's right. Yeah.

233
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:29,006
Oh, gee, what's the matter with me?

234
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,344
How are you?

235
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,138
Well, how are you, Arthur?

236
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,307
Never been better.

237
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,770
It's a nice room.

238
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,273
Lots of sun!

239
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,318
Sit down.

240
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,072
How's your mother?
You call her every day?

241
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,824
Mom passed away.

242
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,367
Really?

243
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,328
When?

244
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,915
About six months ago.

245
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:06,460
Please give her my regards.

246
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,214
Is she still on that crazy diet?

247
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,806
I brought you something.

248
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,019
From my restaurant.
I don't know if you remember Vesuvio?

249
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,146
Oh, of course I do!

250
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:28,024
Way back when your dad had it!

251
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,650
Good for you!

252
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,111
Yeah, I got a new restaurant.

253
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,115
Here you go.

254
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,371
- <i>Cavatelli!</i>
- With a nice duck rag...

255
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,874
Homemade. It's northern.

256
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,045
Oh, northern.

257
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,719
Mrs. S, what's the matter?

258
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,849
Something I said?

259
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:07,730
You're a good boy, Arthur.
Coming to visit me.

260
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:12,902
We go back a ways.
You made a mean PB & J.

261
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,864
After what my son did to you.

262
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,201
Oh, how can I look you in the face?

263
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,994
Tony?

264
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,288
What did he do now?

265
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,416
You don't blame him for setting the fire?

266
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,089
Well, you're a bigger man than some.

267
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,884
Well, we should all be grateful...

268
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,554
...that nobody was incinerated to death.

269
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,524
Altieri's wake is tonight.

270
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,359
I phoned in a bomb scare.

271
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,486
See, now that's over the top.

272
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,622
Junior and Mikey took out the hit.
Start things moving.

273
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,332
Not like we didn't know.

274
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:12,128
- How did you find out for sure?
- No room for interpretation.

275
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,587
<i>Minchia.</i>

276
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,965
- I'm sorry.
- Your own uncle.

277
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,925
Well, let's do it right.

278
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,054
Act normal, plan things out.
Make no mistakes.

279
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,808
If I'm your uncle,
I gotta finish what I started.

280
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,727
He could strike first.

281
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:31,188
And he won't use Boyz II Men this
time, he'll go with who he knows.

282
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:35,526
Chucky Signore.
No, Mikey's now too high up.

283
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,071
Chucky's gotta disappear
without setting off alarms.

284
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,949
I just passed my Coast Guard test.

285
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,163
T, anything else?

286
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,915
My ear hurts.

287
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,846
Here, one of mine.

288
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,681
It'll help you sleep.

289
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,855
What kind of person can I be,
where his own mother wants him dead?

290
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,778
The problem is not with you.

291
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:23,199
That woman is a peculiar duck.
She always has been.

292
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,034
That's not the point.

293
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,661
And she's gotten worse with age.

294
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,872
You think my mother didn't warn me?

295
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,707
Don't start with that again.

296
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:36,295
Your sisters left so young, you'd
think there were contracts on them.

297
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,297
I know.

298
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,216
But you were different.

299
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,760
You tried to make it work.

300
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,556
Two pricks with 9mms.

301
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,310
My self-esteem is nonexistent right now.

302
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,271
I could kill her...

303
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,565
...with these two hands.

304
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,818
The next time I see her...

305
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:02,029
You'll play the concerned
daughter-in-law, even-keeled.

306
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,241
- For the sake of the business.
- Fuck the business.

307
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,576
And let me tell you,
dollars to doughnuts...

308
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:12,081
...this Alzheimer's thing is an act
so she can't be called on her shit.

309
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:19,630
Uncle Jun and I had our
problems with the business...

310
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,299
...but I never should've
razzed him about eating pussy.

311
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,635
This whole war could've been averted.

312
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,264
Cunnilingus and psychiatry
brought us to this.

313
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:32,560
You had to see a shrink
because of the mother you had.

314
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,773
When I look at the guys now,
all I feel is humiliation.

315
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,612
I'll take care of my uncle...

316
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,285
...and I'll take care of Mikey P,
and I'll get some satisfaction.

317
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,121
But inside...

318
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,082
...I'll know.

319
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,269
- Relax!
- What are you doing here?

320
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,688
Putting <i>The Stugots</i>
in the marina next door.

321
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,483
Look at this baby I caught
off the point here.

322
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,167
Just wait a minute!

323
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,628
Oh, no! No!

324
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,090
- Look, I need to talk to you!
- No!

325
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,884
Come on!

326
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,346
I'm dialing 911...

327
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,058
...because you've given me no choice.

328
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,893
Come on!

329
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,981
If anything happens,
they're gonna hear everything!

330
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,901
We'll go down to a coffee shop,
there's plenty of people around!

331
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,570
<i>Emergency services. May I help you?</i>

332
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,656
Let me talk to you!

333
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:55,160
Do I have your word that I'm
in no physical danger?

334
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,955
I'm humbled that you
would take my word, yes.

335
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,873
What?!

336
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,625
Yes, you got my word!

337
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:07,006
<i>Emergency services, state the nature
of your emergency. Hello, hello?</i>

338
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,147
Oh, God!

339
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,864
I take no pleasure in the fact that
I was right about your mother.

340
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,659
Have any dreams since you
heard the FBI tapes?

341
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,327
No.

342
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,376
Some sex dreams.

343
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,465
- Involving?
- My neighbor.

344
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,800
Jean Cusamano.

345
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,886
Go on.

346
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,263
We're doing it doggy style...

347
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,891
You know Jean.

348
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,060
That's okay, go on.

349
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,230
I'm doing her doggy style...

350
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,069
...and I finish, you know,
and her big ass is...

351
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,654
We don't got time for this shit!

352
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,824
It's interesting that you
would say a big ass...

353
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,618
...because Jean is quite slender.

354
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,245
We got bigger things to talk
about than Jean's ass.

355
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:24,458
Feelings of worthlessness sparked
by your mother's plot to have you killed?

356
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,919
One of the reasons they
tried to have me clipped...

357
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,254
...is because I'm seeing a shrink.

358
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,215
You.

359
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,345
You know that our
conversation is privileged...

360
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,098
...and I couldn't testify against anybody.

361
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,768
Well, maybe they know that.
And maybe they don't.

362
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,270
Either way, they're
using it as an excuse.

363
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:49,024
You never mentioned any
of your associates by name.

364
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,694
Except for that one fellow, Booty?

365
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,530
Pussy, Pussy!

366
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:58,117
Pussy, Booty, I don't know his last name!

367
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,953
And anything concerning
your Uncle Junior...

368
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,288
Shut the fuck up a minute!

369
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,043
- You're in danger.
- Get out of here! That's not fair!

370
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,712
<i>Lo cazzo,</i> fair.
They don't give a shit about fair.

371
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,218
What am I supposed to do?

372
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,596
Leave town. Today. Right now.

373
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,308
I'm gonna get some guys here
until you get on a plane!

374
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,602
I can't just do that, lam it!

375
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,688
I have a life, I have patients!

376
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,356
Tell them August came early.

377
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:33,402
It doesn't work that way.
I have patients who are suicidal!

378
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,821
They won't feel any better
if you get clipped!

379
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,365
Jesus fucking Christ!

380
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,327
Look, I know, I'm sorry, okay?

381
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:46,248
I'm gonna work on this problem
and I'll take care of it...

382
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,250
...and you'll be able to come back.

383
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,252
My God!

384
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,881
People are gonna get murdered.

385
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,259
Don't worry about those distractions,
you keep your eye on the ball.

386
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,679
- I know what you're thinking.
- You have no idea.

387
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,849
The cops aren't gonna help you
because you can't give them anything!

388
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,605
Don't be stupid! Even in the short term.

389
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,107
Get the fuck out of town.

390
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:19,823
You've been a good doctor to me.
Thank you.

391
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,295
Artie, how's your rash?

392
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,968
- What are you doing?
- How could you?

393
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,095
How the fuck could you...?

394
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,639
You took their money?

395
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:46,892
Good, then do it.

396
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,894
I don't give a fuck anymore.

397
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,688
That restaurant was like my child.

398
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,024
So they got in your ear.

399
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:58,153
Three generations of Buccos
sweated over that same stove.

400
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,657
Even your mother treasures
the memory of Vesuvio.

401
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,578
My mother?

402
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:11,375
Don't say she's lying, Tone.
Because why would she?

403
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,834
What'd she tell you?

404
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,586
Don't make it worse.

405
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:20,175
Do me the respect of not treating me
like a fucking idiot piece of shit!

406
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:27,266
When you blew up the restaurant,
you made me part of a criminal conspiracy!

407
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,268
Did you ever think about that?

408
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,855
I don't know what she told you,
my mother, of all people.

409
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,485
Arson investigators gave
that fire a clean bill of health.

410
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,279
Why would I blow up your restaurant?

411
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,825
To help me! You fucking bent psycho!

412
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:49,079
You hear your uncle's gonna hurt
my business by staging a hit...

413
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,415
...and that's your solution?

414
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,710
To burn it down for the insurance money!

415
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,215
What kind of stupid, sick, twisted logic?

416
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:03,969
All right. Ask yourself a question.

417
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,096
Am I that fucking stupid?

418
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,435
Am I that fucking stupid, really?

419
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,232
My mother...

420
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:22,237
...God bless her, is going senile, Artie.

421
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,239
You saw her.

422
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,159
I love my new place so much.

423
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,954
And this ruins everything!

424
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:38,920
I swear to God, I didn't
touch your place, Artie.

425
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,882
My mother was confused.

426
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,802
Look me in the eye.

427
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,599
Tell me you didn't lay
a finger on my place!

428
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,395
I didn't burn down your restaurant.

429
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,523
I swear on my mother.

430
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,452
Take it easy!

431
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,955
What the fuck are you doing?

432
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,469
Come on, look out!

433
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,270
It's good we can get together
for our Sunday dinner.

434
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,773
Or somebody's nose
could get out of joint.

435
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:43,985
Joint...!

436
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:48,990
You gotta admit it, Ma.

437
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,369
It's nice that they let you
out for family occasions.

438
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,496
I don't have to admit anything.

439
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,998
- I gotta leave in 10 minutes.
- Meadow!

440
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,126
I have to study with Hunter.

441
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,669
Is this pork cooked?

442
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,212
The kids are growing up.

443
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:06,133
Gonna be out of the house soon.
Even <i>cucuzza</i> over there.

444
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,677
You believe she'll be studying,
I got a bridge to sell you.

445
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:12,264
You know, I read that last
week in the paper...

446
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,850
...about this family in Saint Luis Obispo.

447
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,852
In California.

448
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,355
That whole family died of trichinosis.

449
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,649
That's uncooked pork.

450
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,027
That was last year, that same family.

451
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,364
Listen to him. He knows everything.

452
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,248
Uncle Jun, did you hear from your lawyer?

453
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,667
Hey, on and on it goes.

454
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,879
Ma, don't you agree they should not
talk business at the table?

455
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,131
What's going on in your world?

456
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,757
Such as?

457
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,676
The state of the union.

458
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,389
So I hear Artie Bucco came to see you.

459
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,892
Who is Artie?

460
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,483
Friend of mine from elementary school.

461
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,945
He owns a restaurant.
They had a little fire in it.

462
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,740
Came to see me? Where?

463
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,659
Where are we talking about? Here?

464
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,300
I've lost faith in everything.

465
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,845
You moved away from God
quite some time ago, though.

466
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:37,682
Is it fair to say it's not
just this recent crisis?

467
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,518
Yeah. Back in high school.

468
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,271
Maybe before.

469
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:48,318
I bring the kids here on holidays,
but my mind wanders.

470
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:53,782
I just stare at the stained glass.
People's hats.

471
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,869
I'm full of rage, Father.

472
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,413
Murderous, whatever...

473
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,207
Urges.

474
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:08,463
I don't just hate this man,
I hate all men.

475
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,634
I hate life!

476
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,011
Have you talked with your wife?

477
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,471
I can't.

478
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,014
Why?

479
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,517
Oh, what it would do to her.

480
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,103
She's been through so much.

481
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,772
Charmaine's a strong woman.

482
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,734
She's gonna find out in the course
of the investigation.

483
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,366
I didn't go to the insurance company.

484
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:37,826
Why not?

485
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:43,164
Well, legally... What if I'm wrong?
I could be hit with a defamation suit.

486
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:47,460
Arthur, you know what
your heart is telling you.

487
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,673
The reason you haven't told Charmaine...

488
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,677
...is because you know she'll insist
you go to the police immediately.

489
00:34:56,177 --> 00:35:00,181
And this'll jeopardize your
restaurant, everything.

490
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,476
But you must be strong.

491
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:11,359
All due respect, Father,
you're getting off the subject.

492
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,033
Sorry I'm fucking late.

493
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,456
I need to tell you something.

494
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:29,711
And I want you should hear from me,
not from some asshole on the street.

495
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:39,638
About four or five months ago,
I started seeing a psychiatrist.

496
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:45,352
You know, I was passing out
and they couldn't find nothing.

497
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,855
She's been helping me with that.

498
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,783
Okay, give it to me.
Give it to my face, come on!

499
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:09,626
Well, I'm sure you did it
with complete discretion.

500
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:16,257
And speaking for Pussy, if he's still alive,
I'm sure he would agree.

501
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,886
Business was not discussed,
no names were mentioned.

502
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,600
Junior knows.

503
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,603
He's decided to use it against me.

504
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,280
Ask now, because we're not
discussing this again.

505
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,661
It's not the worst thing I ever heard.

506
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,040
I was seeing a therapist
myself about a year ago.

507
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,131
I had some issues. Enough said.

508
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,383
I learned some coping skills.

509
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:04,222
Look, this thing of ours,
the way it's going...

510
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,143
...be better if we could
admit to each other...

511
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,897
...these are painful, stressful times.

512
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,318
But it'll never fucking happen.

513
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,741
What about you?
You got a problem with this?

514
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,249
What is it? Like, marriage counseling?

515
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,755
Yeah, like that. Sort of, yeah.

516
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,188
The Contra commandant
was trying to scare us priests.

517
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:56,149
That's so dangerous down there.

518
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,530
It's the De Cecco.

519
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:06,910
The fresh basil really adds to it.

520
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:12,123
- Father, you got a little...
- Thanks.

521
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,794
- You want a little bit?
- No, please, I have so much at home.

522
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,379
So how are the twins, Rosalie?

523
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:37,148
You should start with, "Would you
like a cocktail or see the wine list?"

524
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:40,151
Yeah, sure. I'll do it however you like.

525
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,613
My other job, the waiters
do the cocktail solicitation...

526
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,157
...but if you want,
I'll do it as I seat them.

527
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,827
- Good. Great, thanks.
- All right.

528
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,625
She catches on fast, that one.
Very conscientious.

529
00:38:55,917 --> 00:39:00,505
She's working two jobs to become
a music manager, whatever that is.

530
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,051
Everything is going so good.

531
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,640
The new exterminators, I got faith.

532
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,269
The owner is Portuguese.
They're sticklers.

533
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,606
I feel so wonderful,
we're up and running again.

534
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,276
Oh, you said you had
something to tell me.

535
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,323
I like the bar stools.

536
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,457
Good morning, everybody!

537
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,793
You're in a good mood today, Dad.

538
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,972
And if Chucky calls,
you get me on the cell phone.

539
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,641
Ho! You hear me?

540
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:57,353
Yeah, okay.
I think that I heard you already.

541
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,856
Go take a Midol.

542
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:28,593
Nipps! Nipps! Bad boy!

543
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,563
You prick!

544
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,906
Motherfucker!

545
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,000
Son of a bitch! Oh, come on, please!

546
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,752
Please, come on! Come on!

547
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,923
Oh, come on! Oh, please. Please!

548
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,217
Fucking poison ivy all over!

549
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:57,098
My friend Brendan, you shot him
in his bathtub! No chance to run!

550
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,768
No! I swear to God, it was Junior.
He hated that kid, it was him!

551
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:03,521
Yeah, right, it was Junior! Mr. Magoo!

552
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,941
Oh, come on, please, please, please!

553
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,277
I can feel it itching me already!

554
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,141
- Corrado Soprano? FBI.
- Fuck!

555
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,401
- Are you Lawrence Barese?
- What the fuck?

556
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,197
Joseph Sasso, you're under arrest.

557
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:55,990
<i>Junior Soprano...</i>

558
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,993
<i>...boss of the crime family
that bears his name...</i>

559
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:02,330
<i>...was indicted today on federal
racketeering charges.</i>

560
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,334
Talk about timing, he's lucky he's alive!

561
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,629
<i>...along with Lawrence
"Larry Boy" Barese...</i>

562
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,924
<i>...ailing alleged underboss,
Joseph "Beppy" Sasso...</i>

563
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,302
<i>...and 13 other reputed Mob figures.</i>

564
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,137
Oh, my God! It's Uncle Junior!

565
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:22,016
Look at the old guy,
making him do the perp walk!

566
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,227
A legitimate businessman!

567
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,021
- Dad, cut the crap.
- Go dry your hair!

568
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,358
<i>These indictments are part
of an ongoing investigation...</i>

569
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,860
<i>...stretching back nearly four years.</i>

570
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:37,865
<i>They represent the most crippling blow
to Mob activities in New Jersey...</i>

571
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:40,910
<i>...since the early 1980s.</i>

572
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,788
Uncle Junior got busted!

573
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,665
Cool!

574
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,084
<i>Not seized today,
but named in the indictments...</i>

575
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:53,673
<i>...was alleged Soprano enforcer and
loan-sharking chief, Michael Palmice.</i>

576
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:58,678
<i>Authorities believe Palmice may have
fled, acting on prior knowledge.</i>

577
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,263
Oh, lucky him!

578
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:04,725
<i>Palmice's wife denied any knowledge
of her husband's whereabouts.</i>

579
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:10,022
<i>He was so happy, he was going out
to try out his new running shoes.</i>

580
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:17,405
<i>And he told me that he loved me,
and that he would be right back.</i>

581
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,035
All right, go on, go eat somewhere else.

582
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:28,332
Hello? Counselor, thanks for
getting back to me so quick.

583
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:34,088
He says the indictment sounds better
for the feds than it really is.

584
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,257
I wasn't named because the focus...

585
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:39,468
...is some calling-card scam
that Junior and Larry had...

586
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,348
...and this Diamante technical stock
thing that I wasn't into.

587
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,601
Thank God!

588
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,645
That prick, Altieri,
gave them reams of shit.

589
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:54,775
They got stuff on all of us from
the surveillance at Green Grove.

590
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,277
They don't have a case.

591
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,071
An ongoing investigation, the DA said.

592
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,200
They always say that
to make it sound good.

593
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,494
This is no fucking joke.

594
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:10,458
I gotta worry about the guys that
got pinched today, if they flip.

595
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:21,427
So you double-checked all this?
All right, good work.

596
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,850
Art! Hello, how are things?

597
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,144
Good, Father. Busy.

598
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:31,646
You?

599
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,690
Like the man said, "Rust never sleeps."

600
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:40,446
Father, I want to thank you for taking
the time to talk to me the other day.

601
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,241
Did you bring your wife into things?

602
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,534
- No.
- No?

603
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,496
Sitting there in God's house, I realized...

604
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,582
...you can either be a "yes"
person or a "no" person.

605
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,752
A positive ion, or a negative ion.

606
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,589
I'm not quite sure I get
what you're saying.

607
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,758
It's just that...

608
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,679
...this woman's always been
an odd bird, a sea of negativity.

609
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,099
As a kid, we took her ravings
with a grain of salt.

610
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,851
But you also said the son was unstable.

611
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,688
I was...

612
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,231
...angry.

613
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,025
Complicated? Yes, he is.

614
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:21,862
A little too comfortable
outside the law? Yes, he is.

615
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:27,118
But it would only add to the quotient
of sorrow in the world to doubt him.

616
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:32,748
When the source is a person who rarely
has a kind word for anyone.

617
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,377
You seem at peace.

618
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,170
I am, Father.

619
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,756
Thank you again, Father.

620
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,384
Sure. Okay, Artie.

621
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,765
Do you prefer "Corrado" or "Junior"?

622
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,977
I prefer "Mr. Soprano."

623
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:56,564
Your tenure as boss was a short one.

624
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,066
Actually, it was unusual in several ways.

625
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,235
Let me put this to you simply.

626
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:06,240
You can avoid these charges
if you will testify that, in fact...

627
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,869
...you were not the boss
of North Jersey, that in fact...

628
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:14,040
...your nephew Anthony Soprano was,
and is.

629
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:19,545
That he, de facto, controlled your <i>capos</i>
with the backing of New York...

630
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,757
...communicating through
their emissary, John Sacrimoni.

631
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:28,054
We want Johnny Sack.

632
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,015
But more than him,
we want Mangano and Teresi.

633
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,435
I want to fuck Angie Dickinson,
see who gets lucky first.

634
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,229
We want you to confirm
information we have...

635
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,609
...through informants and wiretap
that you were allowed to profit...

636
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:45,279
...but you were not making policy,
and were not in the loop.

637
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,949
You were positioned to take the hits,
and now you have.

638
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:52,787
The question is, how long
you gonna keep eating shit?

639
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:00,294
You're 70 years old.
How many years you got left?

640
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,055
My nephew running things?

641
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,850
Not that <i>stronzo</i>.

642
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,977
Not in this life.

643
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,530
Here, let me <i>schlepp</i> that.

644
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,825
You got any more in the car?

645
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:33,869
How did you get in?

646
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:37,123
Liliana. She left early.

647
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,501
So, what they're saying on the TV
about the storm, huh?

648
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,212
Yeah. You want some coffee?

649
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,506
Only if you're making it.

650
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,633
Father, don't start that.

651
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:52,638
No, really. I mean it's practically
cocktail hour, anyway.

652
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,598
Glass of wine?

653
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,268
How about a Lilet? You in the mood?

654
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:03,357
Just came to see how you're
holding up with these indictments.

655
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,401
We're hanging in.

656
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:10,448
What we were talking about
a few months back...

657
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,908
Think these recent developments...

658
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,454
...have brought Tony any closer
to re-examining his life?

659
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,372
Making some hard choices?

660
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,541
I told her not to use my card!

661
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:25,212
No, that's mine. <i>One True Thing</i>,
just out on DVD.

662
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,256
I was over at Video One anyway...

663
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,926
...I thought you'd want to take
your mind off these stressors.

664
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,056
You want to stay for dinner?

665
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,059
Something wrong, Carm?

666
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,562
Tell me so I know how many
steaks to defrost.

667
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:42,938
Tony's not gonna make it.

668
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,733
Well, if...

669
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,236
As I was saying,
my real concern for Tony...

670
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:54,074
Father, he doesn't give a flying fuck.
You know it and I know it.

671
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,327
At least for the foreseeable future.

672
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,121
- Even a bigger reason...
- He's a sinner.

673
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:04,460
And you come here and eat his steaks
and use his entertainment center.

674
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,714
- Carmela, the DVD is for you.
- Really?

675
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:11,967
Last week I told you I'm not
a Renée Zellweger fan!

676
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,720
You did? I don't remember that.

677
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:18,641
You want to watch <i>One True Thing,</i>
fine. At least admit it.

678
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:24,104
I thought you liked movies.
<i>Mea culpa!</i>

679
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:28,275
Oh, Jesus, I get exactly the same
"who, me?" shit with Tony.

680
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,152
Two, I don't need!

681
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,657
"Has Tony thought about changing?"
Father, please.

682
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:39,286
You do think I'm a <i>schnorrer</i>,
don't you? A parasite.

683
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:42,623
You denied it, but clearly
that's what you think.

684
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,875
No, you know what I think, Father?

685
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,796
I think you like the...
I don't know what to call it...

686
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:53,384
...the whiff of sexuality
that never goes anyplace.

687
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,388
I have feelings for you,
Carmela, I admitted it.

688
00:50:57,638 --> 00:51:01,934
It's my job to deal with them so I
can carry on my pastoral duties.

689
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,979
How does Rosalie Aprile fit
into your feelings for me?

690
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,983
Oh, so that's it.

691
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:14,363
I appreciate everything that you've
done for me, Father Phil.

692
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,824
The religious counseling...

693
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:20,327
...the book on Buddhism,
the wonderful chats.

694
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,329
I am very fond of you.

695
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,165
More than fond.

696
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,128
But I think you need to look at yourself.

697
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,173
Call this an intervention.

698
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:39,471
I think you have this m.o. where you
manipulate spiritually thirsty women.

699
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:43,183
And I think a lot of it is tied up
with food somehow...

700
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,353
...as well as the sexual tension game.

701
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,496
Mr. Soprano! Your wife found you, good.

702
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,873
What are you talking about?

703
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:51,669
You haven't spoken?
We left a message on your home machine.

704
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,796
Your mom's had a stroke.

705
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,589
Stroke?

706
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:59,093
The news on TV upset her,
not that it's my business.

707
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,678
Anyhow, it just happened.

708
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:04,598
The EMTs are stabilizing her
for the ride to St. Vincent's.

709
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,479
I know what you did.

710
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,565
Your only son. Your middle child.

711
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:16,151
She can't answer, her speech
has been affected!

712
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,278
Yeah, my ass.

713
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:22,783
I heard the FBI tapes, Ma.
You know what I'm talking about.

714
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,536
George Clooney, don't get in the middle!

715
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:28,455
- Call security!
- Uncle Jun's in jail now.

716
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:31,709
I got one more little detail
to take care of.

717
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,795
I don't die that fucking easy, Ma!

718
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,715
I'll live a long life.
More than I can say for you.

719
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,675
All right, that's enough!

720
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,510
Keep her moving!

721
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,637
You try to have me whacked?!

722
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:44,972
She doesn't understand!

723
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:49,309
She's smiling, look at her face!
She's smiling!

724
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,270
Get off me!

725
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,648
Look at her face!
She's got a fucking smile on her face!

726
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,276
All right, that's enough!

727
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,934
She go vacation!

728
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:59,338
Dad, give it up. We're not gonna
make it to Aunt Patty's.

729
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:05,511
Dad, hello! We're not gonna
make it to Aunt Patty's.

730
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,013
Why did I buy a goddamn off-road vehicle?

731
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,557
To waste petrochemical resources?

732
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:14,895
She's right, we can't keep driving.
I can hardly see in front of us.

733
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:18,732
- What street are we on?
- I think it's Walnut Parkway.

734
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,651
I've got an idea.

735
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,370
Come on, come on! Inside!

736
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,498
- He better be open!
- Forget the umbrella, come on!

737
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,299
Artie, thank Christ!

738
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,635
We picked up the kids at school...

739
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:49,513
...we can't get home.
There's a tree across Mountain Ave.

740
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,098
Oh, <i>Madonna!</i>

741
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,767
We've been driving since 7,
nobody's eaten.

742
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:58,105
I got no power, I'm closing soon
as these last people leave.

743
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,940
Let's go to Mickey D's.

744
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,317
Yeah, all right, let's go.

745
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,487
- Let's go.
- No!

746
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,948
Come on! Come on!

747
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,659
We'll figure out something, come on!

748
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,872
They gave me steroids too,
but it fucked me up!

749
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,958
Keep away from me,
because I skeeve, all right?

750
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,626
Hey, look at this!

751
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,546
Hey, what are you doing, you all right?

752
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,256
How you doing, pal?

753
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,466
Adriana, you look beautiful.

754
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:28,218
How you doing?

755
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,099
How are you?

756
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:39,062
Chiara, her brother and sister are
in the kitchen if you want to say hi.

757
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:40,814
More refugees.

758
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,649
The gas is still working.

759
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,485
I'm cooking by candlelight.
I can make anything...

760
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,654
Whatever you got is fine.

761
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:52,492
Jose! Cabernet, <i>por favor</i>.
Regaleali, right?

762
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,453
Yeah, beautiful.

763
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,081
No cigars, please.

764
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:08,258
Look at that fucking lovesick
pygmy over there.

765
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,348
The skip seeing a psychiatrist...
How does that sit with your ass?

766
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:19,019
I usually do sit with my ass.
Why don't you sit with yours?

767
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,688
Hey, Pat Cooper over here.

768
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:26,902
Wait a minute, this bothers you?
You saw a fucking psychiatrist!

769
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,403
Not a woman!

770
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,698
I can't get past that.
It don't compute for me.

771
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,617
You're the one with the issues.

772
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,453
Woman issues.
I don't want to fucking go there.

773
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,038
Let's not.

774
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,875
Irregardless, I said my piece.

775
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,835
What're you getting at, Paulie?

776
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,713
Nothing.

777
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,842
Look, he's gonna be the new boss now.

778
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:54,972
In name, in everything.
Wish him <i>buona fortuna</i>.

779
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,478
You guys got any peanut butter back here?

780
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:17,411
Oh, God, Artie, you saved
our frigging lives here!

781
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,331
- It's beautiful, Artie, thank you!
- Enjoy!

782
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,420
Fuck!

783
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,505
- Hey!
- You said "frig."

784
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,802
Wait a minute.

785
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,264
I'd like to propose a toast.

786
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,018
To my family.

787
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:48,108
Someday soon, you're gonna
have families of your own.

788
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,028
And if you're lucky...

789
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,947
...you'll remember the little moments...

790
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:55,824
...like this...

791
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,247
...that were good.

792
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,168
Cheers!
