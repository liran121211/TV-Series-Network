1
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,699
How'd it go?

2
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,119
They've got a 48 to 52 male/female
ratio, which is great.

3
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,831
A strong liberal arts program and
the Olin Arts Center for music.

4
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,334
The usual programs abroad
are China, India...

5
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,836
You're just applying.
Already you're leaving?

6
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,672
It's an option, Dad. Junior year.

7
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,343
What'll you study in India?
How not to get diarrhea?

8
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,138
They don't require SAT scores,
but mine are high.

9
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,931
Socially, I don't know.

10
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,850
I heard there's a saying:

11
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,646
"Bates is the world's most expensive
form of contraception."

12
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,314
What kind of talk is that?

13
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,858
The girls at the other colleges put out?

14
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,443
Oh, my God.

15
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,740
It's pretty, huh?

16
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,784
Yeah.

17
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,953
Two to go. Colby up.

18
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,958
Dad, how come you didn't finish college?

19
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,461
I had a semester and a half at Seton Hall.

20
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,463
Yeah, and...?

21
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,883
My parents didn't stress college.

22
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,094
They were working-class people.

23
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,596
How come they were anti-education?

24
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,932
They weren't "anti."

25
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,810
You can't lay it all off on them.

26
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,521
I got into trouble when I was a kid.

27
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,690
- I heard.
- You did?

28
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,317
<i>In Waterville, dine at the Stone House.</i>

29
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,237
<i>Serving the freshest Maine lobsters.</i>

30
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,657
<i>Come see our new salad bar,
featuring a wonderful...</i>

31
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,586
Are you in the Mafia?

32
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,467
- Am I in the what?
- Whatever, organized crime?

33
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,305
That's crap. Who told you that?

34
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,474
I've lived in the house all my life.

35
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,769
I've seen police come,
I've seen you go out at 3 a.m.

36
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,481
You never seen Doc Cusamano
go out at 3 a.m. on a call?

37
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,276
The Cusamano kids ever find $50,000...

38
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,154
...and a .45 while hunting for Easter eggs?

39
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:01,158
In the waste management business,
everybody assumes you're mobbed up.

40
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,119
It's a stereotype, and it's offensive.

41
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,496
You're the last person
I want to perpetuate it.

42
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,123
Fine.

43
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,919
There is no Mafia.

44
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,346
All right, look...

45
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,516
...Med, you're a grown woman.

46
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,143
Almost.

47
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,521
Some of my money...

48
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,525
...comes from illegal
gambling and whatnot.

49
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,533
How does that make you feel?

50
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,537
At least you don't keep
denying it like Mom.

51
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,248
Kids in school think it's neat.

52
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,042
Seen <i>The Godfather</i>, right?

53
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,545
<i>Casino</i> we like.
Sharon Stone, '70s clothes, pills.

54
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,090
I'm not asking about those bums.
I'm asking about you.

55
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,927
Sometimes I wish you
were like other dads.

56
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,722
But then like, Mr. Scangarelo,
for example.

57
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:10,227
An advertising executive for big tobacco.
Or lawyers? Ugh.

58
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,813
- So many dads are full of shit.
- I'm not?

59
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,732
You finally told the truth about this.

60
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,908
Look, Med, part of my income comes
from legitimate businesses.

61
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,326
The stock market...

62
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:30,497
Look, Dad, please.
Don't start mealy-mouthing.

63
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,089
How's my sweetheart?

64
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,092
<i>I'm so pissed, I can hardly see.</i>

65
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,593
You getting the flu?

66
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,097
- No. That's my cousin, Svetlana.
- The amputee?

67
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,351
Two months she's only in America,
and she's already getting married.

68
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,105
You knew the deal. I got two kids.
We talked about this.

69
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:59,943
Yes, and a wife whenever you want.
What do I have in my life?

70
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,444
Am I glad I called.

71
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,114
Fuck you, then! Hang up!

72
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,283
How are the whirlpool jets?

73
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,411
Don't throw up in my face
things you buy me.

74
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,415
Her prosthetic leg fell off in a Gap store...

75
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,960
...and he carries her out like a knight...

76
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,212
...in a white satin armor.

77
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,632
I gotta go, my daughter's coming.

78
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,469
Jesus!

79
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,021
How you feeling?

80
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,942
Better, actually. Fever just broke.
I miss you two.

81
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,487
- <i>How's the interviews going?</i>
- Good, real good.

82
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,947
<i>Did she like Bates?</i>

83
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,243
<i>Anything to get her
off of this Berkeley kick.</i>

84
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,996
What the fuck?

85
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,665
<i>Tony?</i>

86
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,500
Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,003
Look, I'll call you from the motel.

88
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,187
Meadow! Come on!

89
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,866
- Come on, get in.
- Okay, okay, what's the rush?

90
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,037
Jesus, Dad!

91
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,544
What's going on?

92
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,381
I think I saw an old friend.

93
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,549
You know that guy?

94
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,344
Maybe not. Probably not.

95
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,179
Then what?

96
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,932
Dad, slow down!

97
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,272
- Jesus, what's with you?!
- It's all right.

98
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,400
Fucking maniac!

99
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,903
- What's going on?
- Just fooling around.

100
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,244
Colby! Turn!

101
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,413
Colby! Turn left, it's left!

102
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,417
Dad!

103
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,253
That's because you're talking.

104
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,846
This gets us to Colby anyhow.

105
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,476
Dad, that's our motel.

106
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,604
Our motel's right there.

107
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,071
- Did you know that guy?
- It wasn't him.

108
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,501
Bada-bing.

109
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,128
Take this number down.

110
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,629
Now? It's pouring.

111
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,841
<i>207-555-0185.</i>

112
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:17,432
<i>Bonjour.</i> Room service <i>est arrivé.</i>

113
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,314
Why, thank you, kind sir.

114
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,988
What? You said poached eggs.

115
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,992
You're not eating, after all that work?

116
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,870
My eyes were bigger than my stomach.

117
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,714
Why don't you go over
to Jason's, play Nintendo.

118
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,136
Nope, no kisses. Cooties.

119
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,846
I'll be back in an hour.

120
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,473
Okay.

121
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,114
Oh, motherfucker.

122
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,784
Motherfucking shit.

123
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,541
I'm not sure, but I think
I saw Fabian Petrulio.

124
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,043
- Refresh my memory.
- <i>Before your time?</i>

125
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,797
Made guy, flipped 10 years ago.
He got busted for peddling H.

126
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,715
Took out a lot of people.

127
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,551
<i>People from our outfit.</i>

128
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,887
My old man was sick.
He never recovered when he heard.

129
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,389
You saw this guy?

130
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,100
I'm saying I think I did,
but I'm not sure.

131
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,144
Up in Maine? What the fuck?

132
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,063
<i>He was in the witness-protection
program. Then they kicked him out.</i>

133
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,566
He goes to colleges and gets paid...

134
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,901
...to talk about what
a big Mafioso he was.

135
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,153
Piece of shit.

136
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,156
We partied, but Jackie
Aprile knew him good.

137
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,491
<i>They did time in Lewisburg.</i>

138
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,744
You know that bust in his
rec room with Sinatra?

139
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,038
Febbie made it in a prison workshop.

140
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,917
That was Frank?
I always thought it was Shaquille.

141
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,253
Fucker needs to practice on lips.

142
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,256
I know. Anyway, run these plates for me.

143
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,925
Go ahead.

144
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,930
"Maine, DX66920," call you
back tonight at 10, all right?

145
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,769
What's wrong with the phone in your room?

146
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:31,274
Nothing. Just taking a walk, saw it,
figured I'd call Christopher.

147
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,775
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

148
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,277
Everything okay?

149
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,946
They got a leak in the roof, all right?

150
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,371
- Who is it?
- Father Phil.

151
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,709
Just a second. Oh, Jesus.

152
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:18,029
- Oh, my God. Look at you!
- I hope I'm not barging in.

153
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,448
No. I was watching TV.

154
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,077
I was at the clothing drive.
I thought you were in Maine.

155
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,956
Your Moschino peddle-pusher
suit, it flew out of there.

156
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,083
Good, good, good!

157
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,752
Anyway, Jean Cusamano said you were ill.

158
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,588
Yes, I was.
The flu that was going around.

159
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,342
- Yipes!
- Yeah, I still have a little fever.

160
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,762
I also have a confession to make, Carm.

161
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,978
I have a jones for your baked ziti.

162
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,481
I have some in the freezer.
I can reheat it.

163
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,692
It's so much better that way.

164
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,987
- The mozzarella gets nice and chewy.
- I like that.

165
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,282
I was having some Fernet.
Would you like something?

166
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,117
Some wine, if it's open.

167
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,662
So how's Med and Tony's trip going?

168
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:12,333
I should know? He doesn't have time
to talk to me for two minutes.

169
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,717
Stop staring.
Why are you doing that?

170
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,136
It's an exciting time.

171
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,930
I can't tell you how proud I am.

172
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,891
A real student at <i>Casa Soprano</i>.

173
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,437
And she looks like a model
out of Italian <i>Vogue</i>.

174
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,315
Italian, Italian, Italian.
Thank you.

175
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,152
You're up to something.

176
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,530
How'd you get so cynical?

177
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,539
That stuff we talked about.
How's that sitting with you?

178
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,334
Not like I wasn't 90% sure already.

179
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,086
What about your brother?
Does he know?

180
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,921
I think so.

181
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,843
There was a time when Italian people
didn't have a lot of options.

182
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,929
You mean like Mario Cuomo?

183
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,015
Sorry.

184
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,853
I put food on the table.

185
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,273
My father was in it, my uncle was in it.

186
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,318
Maybe I was too lazy to think for myself.

187
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,113
Considered myself a rebel.

188
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,034
Being a rebel in my family would
have been selling patio furniture.

189
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,039
In college, nothing interested you?

190
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,500
I barely got in.

191
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,128
Well, I kind of liked history.

192
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,588
Yeah?

193
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,883
Napoleon, The Roman Empire.

194
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,260
The Potsdam Conference, that stuff.

195
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,845
The Potsdam Conference?

196
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,849
- Potsdamned if I know now.
- Oh, my God.

197
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,190
I have something to tell you.

198
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,818
Yeah?

199
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:05,905
You're not...?

200
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,824
No. Jesus.

201
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:16,541
A couple of weeks ago, me and some
friends, we were doing speed.

202
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,335
- We did a lot for a while.
- You what?

203
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:24,841
It was just between homework and SATs
and the general pressure of life...

204
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,217
We needed something.

205
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,511
- That crap'll kill you!
- I know.

206
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,222
I ought to slap you.
Where'd you get it?

207
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,933
If I knew I'd get a lecture,
I wouldn't have told.

208
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:37,728
Reality check! What do you think I'd say?
Where did you get it?

209
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,857
I'm not telling.
Especially after this reaction.

210
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,567
Why did you tell me?

211
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,863
You were honest with me today.

212
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,240
I won't do it again.
It got too scary.

213
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,910
Jesus, right under my nose.

214
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,745
You'd think you'd know.

215
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,040
No, Dad. You won't.

216
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,301
Well, I'm glad you told me.
In spite of everything.

217
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:12,722
I'm glad too. I'm glad we have
that kind of relationship.

218
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,149
Tony hates building fires.

219
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,528
We have this beautiful fireplace with logs
from when Lincoln split them.

220
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,865
Fear of fire is good to keep out of hell.

221
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,368
Well, maybe there is hope for him.

222
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,415
I got something for you.
It's what we were talking about.

223
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,084
The chapter on Buddhism is spectacular.

224
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,587
But I don't want you going over to them.

225
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:49,050
Fat chance. I could never just sit
on the floor and think of nothing.

226
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,177
- Thank you.
- Sure.

227
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:56,599
You'll see how Islam has gotten
a bad rap in current culture...

228
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,603
Boy, this Chianti, though,
is beyond reproach.

229
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,313
Word up.

230
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,945
- Dad.
- I thought you fell in.

231
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,282
This is Carrie and Lucinda.

232
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,201
They go to Colby.

233
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,245
Why not hang out with them?

234
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,704
Dad.

235
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,082
What better way to learn
about the college?

236
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,459
Yeah, maybe.

237
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,253
No, that'd be cool.

238
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,712
Please excuse him.

239
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,507
No, really, we love to dish the school.

240
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,260
Go ahead.

241
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,639
No drinking. Girls, you see
that she sticks to Cokes.

242
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,268
I'll come back in an hour and a half.
Be good.

243
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,069
- <i>What have you got?</i>
- Wet shoes.

244
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,239
Don't want to work in the rain,
try out for the Yankees.

245
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,866
The car is registered
to Fredrick Peters...

246
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,911
...38 Washington Street,
Waterville, Maine.

247
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,247
<i>It's off Route 201. I looked it up.</i>

248
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:06,002
Fredrick Peters, Fabian Petrulio.
Good match, huh?

249
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,714
I guess, I don't know.
T, what are you going to do?

250
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,718
I don't know. I got Meadow here.

251
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,219
Jesus.

252
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,055
<i>If you want, I'll fly up
and take care of it.</i>

253
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,224
Ah, you're a good kid.

254
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,852
<i>You stay put. Call Pussy or Paulie.</i>

255
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,688
- They can but I can't?
- <i>Don't be sensitive.</i>

256
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,107
They had a friend die
in prison due to him.

257
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,567
I'll let them know.

258
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,862
I gotta do my homework
and positively I.D. this guy.

259
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,530
I thought it was him.

260
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,866
<i>I haven't seen him in 12 years.</i>

261
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,620
I'll call you around midnight. Sit tight.

262
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,754
You think I'm a <i>schnorrer</i>?

263
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,422
A who?

264
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:56,427
Yiddish. Means somebody who always
shows up in time for free grub.

265
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,721
No, you're here a lot.

266
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,432
But you're a man, you like to eat.

267
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,686
I can't get over you with that Yiddish.

268
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,733
My neighborhood in Yonkers was mixed
Jewish and Italian, you know?

269
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,027
A heady brew.

270
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,737
What does that mean, "heady"?

271
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,991
You know, melting pot. Vigor.

272
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,998
Hello.

273
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,750
<i>I'm calling for Tony Soprano.</i>

274
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,502
Cajun stuffed olives?

275
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,003
Who can I say is calling?

276
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,588
This is Dr. Melfi.

277
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,256
His nurse?

278
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,259
No, is this Mrs. Soprano?

279
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,512
That's right, and you are?

280
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,639
<i>Jennifer Melfi. Dr. Melfi?</i>

281
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,225
Jennifer, lovely name.

282
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:46,644
<i>He's not home.</i>

283
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,064
Could I impose on you to tell him...

284
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:54,360
...I need to reschedule Monday's appointment?
I'm down with the flu.

285
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,945
Does he have your number?

286
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,863
Let me give it to you.

287
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,574
I lost my pencil, up his ass.

288
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,535
<i>I'll tell him you called.</i>

289
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,670
Why does he have to lie?

290
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,465
Why couldn't he tell me
his therapist is a woman?

291
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,719
Maybe he did tell you,
and you didn't hear him.

292
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,597
Why wouldn't he tell me,
unless he's screwing her?

293
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,891
Carmela, please.

294
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,561
I thought he was changing.

295
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:33,315
I thought therapy would help clear up
the fucking freak show in his head.

296
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,193
I'm sure you're wrong about them.

297
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,071
Therapy is a start. It's a good start.

298
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,491
But, yes, it doesn't fix the soul.

299
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,828
He'll need help from other
sources to repair that.

300
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,497
Then you talk to him! You help him!

301
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,791
But, well, there you go.

302
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,918
I mean, will he listen?

303
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,506
He must be a very unhappy man.

304
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:02,219
He's unhappy?!
Sleep is my number one... Ah, shit!

305
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,556
Why go into it?

306
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,873
- Mommy!
- Yes, bear?

307
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,292
Would you put me to bed? I'm scared.

308
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,127
Sure, honey, hold on.

309
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,547
- I thought she was sleeping.
- Well, she woke up.

310
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,801
Daddy's gonna come too.
We'll both put you to bed.

311
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,803
- Hurry, Daddy.
- Yeah, yeah.

312
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,049
These red pepper flakes
make all the difference.

313
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,759
Spicy.

314
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:29,098
As good as Willem Dafoe was,
I cannot picture that Jesus looked like him.

315
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,183
Could you pass the cheese?

316
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,936
Not that he didn't do well...

317
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,938
...but the story's confusing.

318
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,732
He gets down off the cross?

319
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,404
Originally, Bobby D.
was to have that role.

320
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,072
Really?

321
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,199
Different picture.

322
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,285
Oh, totally.

323
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,788
"You talking to me, Pilate?

324
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,292
You must be talking to me.
I don't see nobody else here...

325
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,003
...except Barabbas, here."

326
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,297
You know what's remarkable?

327
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,466
If you take everything Jesus
ever said, add it up...

328
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,635
...it amounts to two hours of talk.

329
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,137
No!

330
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,848
I heard the same thing about the Beatles.

331
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,768
Except if you add up all their songs,
it comes to 10 hours.

332
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,857
Yes.

333
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,321
It wasn't just what Christ
said, it was his deeds.

334
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,948
See, that's my question.

335
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,869
I understand what he did, but a lot
of what he said, I don't get.

336
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:37,124
Like, "The sun rises on the just
and the unjust alike?" Why?

337
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,877
Because, Christ was saying
that we're all...

338
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,755
Whores will go to Heaven
before the righteous?

339
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,965
That's not right.

340
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,177
Father, we got some major
contradictions here.

341
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,765
It's about love. See it that way.

342
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,683
What does that mean?

343
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,518
It means...

344
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:00,689
...hopefully someday
we will learn to tolerate...

345
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,151
...accept and forgive
those that are different.

346
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,032
Change through love.

347
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,337
I better get going.

348
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,255
Where you going?
You just got here.

349
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,966
It's getting late.

350
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,134
Well, it's pouring rain out.

351
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:32,763
I know you love the DVD player.
I got <i>Remains of the Day</i>.

352
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,976
See, do I know you?

353
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,478
Anything with Emma Thompson.

354
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,563
I didn't know you looked.

355
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,148
What?

356
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,777
To take in through the eyes
a beautiful woman...

357
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,949
...is that different than a sunset?
A Douglas fir?

358
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,451
Or any of God's handiwork?

359
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,838
- Hey, Fred.
- Tanky, what do you say?

360
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,174
You gonna give away
homemade cheese this year?

361
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,968
For what they get for cream,
I don't know.

362
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:57,306
Tank, anybody been looking for me
or asking any questions about me?

363
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,141
Big guy, New York sounding?

364
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,976
Is there a problem?

365
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:06,398
No. Dipshit hit me with his boat while
I was tubing on Caribou Lake.

366
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,317
Claims it was my fault.

367
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,195
If he shows up, do you want me to call?

368
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,198
Yeah, I wouldn't mind.
Do that, thanks.

369
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,222
No one's asking for you, Fred.

370
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,391
All right, Vitus. Thanks.

371
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,478
Hello, rat.

372
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,268
<i>Please leave me alone.</i>

373
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,896
<i>Why won't you show me your book?</i>

374
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,565
<i>This is my private time.
You're invading it.</i>

375
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,484
<i>Oh, is that so?</i>

376
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,654
<i>- I'm invading your private time, am I?
- Yes.</i>

377
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,617
<i>What's in that book?
Come on, let me see.</i>

378
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,996
<i>Or are you protecting me,
is that what you're doing?</i>

379
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,666
<i>Would I be shocked?</i>

380
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,461
<i>Would it ruin my character?</i>

381
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,216
<i>Let me see it.</i>

382
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,031
Father, turn it off. I can't handle it.

383
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,410
What? What is it?

384
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,246
Oh, Father, I'm a terrible person.

385
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:54,501
Oh, no. You're a wonderful woman.

386
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,921
It's been building in me.
I need to get it out.

387
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,881
There's so much in me, I...

388
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:05,554
- I want to...
- Carmela, if I can help, please.

389
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,559
How?

390
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,900
How long since you last confessed?

391
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,072
I, uh...

392
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,241
if you'd like, I can do this.

393
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,579
You mean here? Now?

394
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,751
The whole world is God's house.
He hears and sees everything.

395
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:04,488
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

396
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:09,659
It has been four weeks since my last confession...
What am I talking about?

397
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,286
That's a lie.

398
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:15,332
I haven't truly confessed in 20 years.

399
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,128
Go on.

400
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,090
I have forsaken...

401
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:29,179
...what is right for what is easy.

402
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,603
Allowing what I know is evil in my house.

403
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,482
Allowing my children...

404
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,319
...oh, my God, my sweet children,
to be a part of it.

405
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,197
Because I wanted things for them.

406
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:50,784
Wanted a better life. Good schools.

407
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,328
I wanted this house.

408
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,333
I wanted money in my hands,
money to buy anything I ever wanted.

409
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,293
I'm so ashamed.

410
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,929
My husband...

411
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,892
I think he has committed horrible acts.

412
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:21,440
I think he has...
You know all about him, Father Phil.

413
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,776
I've said nothing.
I've done nothing about it.

414
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,489
I got a bad feeling.

415
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,286
It's a matter of time before
God compensates me...

416
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,580
...with outrage for my sins.

417
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,557
All right, come on.

418
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,562
Oh, tequila breath.

419
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,855
Sorry, Dad.

420
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,232
It's all right. Just hang on to me.

421
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,861
Throw up on that dress,
I'll have to tell Mom.

422
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,740
This guy was giving me tequila shooters.

423
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,455
Oh, God, everything is spinning.

424
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,708
- You're not mad, are you?
- A little bit.

425
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,085
- Where are the keys?
- I gave them to you.

426
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,754
Supposed to be.

427
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,590
- I love you, Dad.
- I know.

428
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,561
You must truly repent.

429
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,606
Genuinely and honestly.

430
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:51,071
In the future you must renounce these
actions, and God will absolve you.

431
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,118
I don't know, Father. I'll try.

432
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,122
But I still love him.

433
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,793
I believe he can be a good man.

434
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,338
Then you help change him
into a better man.

435
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,049
Then you will have done
good in God's eyes.

436
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,222
You should take Communion.

437
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:36,908
Why do you have that?

438
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:41,913
Unfortunately I had to say Mass
for someone in intensive care.

439
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:50,839
Lord, I am not worthy to receive Thee.

440
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:55,677
- But just say the word...
- And I will be healed.

441
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,826
This is the body of Christ.
It was broken for you.

442
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,550
This is the blood of Christ.

443
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,386
It was shed for you.

444
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:04,746
Accept the spirit of Christ,
our Lord and Savior.

445
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,290
Amen.

446
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:12,087
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

447
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,149
Dad?

448
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,487
<i>I booked a seat on a Boston flight.
Tomorrow, 4:00.</i>

449
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,323
- Best I could get.
- Don't come.

450
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,284
I'll make sure you're gone
before it happens.

451
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,954
- <i>We won't ever meet.</i>
- This is my thing.

452
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:50,333
I am your soldier. This is my duty
like we're always talking about.

453
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,460
The way this went down...

454
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,880
...this is my call.
I'll vouch for this myself.

455
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:59,300
Clipping a rat puts me a cunt-hair
away from being made.

456
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,804
He might've recognized me
at the gas station. He could lam.

457
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,852
You stay put. End of discussion.

458
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,148
Why are you using the pay phone?

459
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,316
These walls are like paper.

460
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,069
- Please don't lie to me.
- Go back to bed.

461
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,739
Lying down made me throw up.

462
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,687
Hello.

463
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,939
Oh, hi, honey.

464
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,693
Oh, yeah. Was it fun?

465
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,780
Oh, good.

466
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,827
You want to sleep over there?

467
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,666
Okay. Love you.

468
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,483
That was A.J.

469
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:43,071
- He's sleeping over.
- I see.

470
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:50,328
- At a friend's house.
- Oh.

471
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,626
The Pucillos. I don't know
if you know them.

472
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,295
No.

473
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,766
Are you all right?

474
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,904
Father Phil?

475
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,990
Are you all right?

476
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,849
Hello?

477
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,850
Ow! Don't!

478
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,520
You want to stop and get a beer?

479
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,990
I'll pick you up in a little while.
Knock 'em dead.

480
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,326
- Aren't you coming in?
- I left my watch at the motel.

481
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,578
I'll catch up to you later.

482
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,498
Grab me a student paper.

483
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,881
You should have some coffee.

484
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,303
Last night...

485
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:40,141
We didn't do anything out of line.

486
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,852
There's nothing to apologize about.

487
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,773
- Right.
- That's right.

488
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:53,071
I should get dressed. Get going.

489
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,323
Anthony Jr. will be home soon.

490
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:59,619
Oh, my God. My car's been out
there all night in plain sight.

491
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,288
We didn't do anything wrong.

492
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,291
Is there a commandment
against eating ziti?

493
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,045
Take a shower, get dressed.

494
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,548
Don't forget your
sacrament kit, whatever.

495
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,553
I'm home!

496
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,226
Carmela.

497
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,355
I don't know where to begin.

498
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:35,738
It's not that I don't have
desire for you in my heart.

499
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,490
<i>Madonna</i>, Father, please.

500
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:41,577
Last night was one of the most
difficult tests from God ever.

501
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,288
What are you talking about?
We're friends.

502
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,252
- What's that look?
- What, I look some way?

503
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:58,511
I was just thinking about when
we watched <i>Casablanca</i> last week.

504
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,722
That new print is great, huh?

505
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:07,562
"Of all the lousy gin joints in the world,
why'd you have to pick mine?"

506
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:14,068
Of all the <i>finocchi</i> priests,
why did I get the one who's straight?

507
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,239
Carmela.

508
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,908
Come on, it's a joke.

509
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,308
I would have done it myself,
but some people came along.

510
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:49,061
Anyway, listen.
It's a gray Town Car, new model.

511
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,522
Pick him up on the Colby campus.

512
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,566
Where on the Colby campus?

513
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,694
His kid's applying,
the fucking admissions office.

514
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,197
- Oh.
- You follow him.

515
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,617
Outside of town, you pull up
alongside, boom! 12-gauge.

516
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,619
- Fuck that.
- Do it...

517
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,496
...or you'll never get
another bag off me.

518
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,671
No, no, no. Fuck that.
Fuck that!

519
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,633
Want the cops to know who
burnt the Historical House?

520
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,510
Fuck you, fuckwad!

521
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:25,640
We were volunteer firemen
together, asshole! I know!

522
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,318
Yeah, is Dougy in?

523
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,019
- Good morning, rat.
- Who are you? What is this?

524
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,521
Don't make me laugh. You fuck!

525
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,774
Teddy, there must be something...

526
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,568
It's Tony. Know how much
trouble you're in?

527
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,279
You took an oath and you broke it.

528
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,157
I could have killed you
outside the motel.

529
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,950
Your daughter was drunk.

530
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:51,660
I was in the parking lot.

531
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:55,289
I didn't do it because of her.
I told myself:

532
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,167
"It's just a coincidence...

533
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:01,087
- ...he's taking her to college."
- With wiseguys...

534
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,963
...the hustle never ends.

535
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,925
If you'd shot me, your life
would have been over.

536
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,885
Please. I'm begging you.

537
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,223
Jimmy says hello from hell!

538
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,109
Where've you been?

539
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,696
The motel didn't have the watch.
I went to the restaurant.

540
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,449
I had to wait for them to open.

541
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,451
The restaurant had your watch?

542
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:59,079
I took it off in the bathroom
while I washed my hands.

543
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,582
You ready? You'll be late for Bowdoin.

544
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:18,098
What's up with that?

545
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,730
Oh, the restaurant.

546
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,691
I tried the back door
and there were puddles.

547
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,113
It was dumb, I know.

548
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,412
Your hand is bleeding!

549
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,748
You saw that man, didn't you?

550
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:46,794
I cut it on a screen door.
What man?

551
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:49,213
The man you said you didn't know.

552
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:51,507
What do you think happened?

553
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,634
I don't know. A fight?

554
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,220
You're making it a big deal,
and you don't know!

555
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,306
You were on the pay phone
again at 1 a.m.!

556
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:02,101
I was on the pay phone at 1 a.m.?

557
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,061
Excuse me, Miss Cuervo Añejo.

558
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:08,857
You can't remember what happened.
You were seeing pink elephants!

559
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,069
I warned you not to drink.

560
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:19,285
Dad, you're being honest with me, right?

561
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,161
You're gonna hurt my feelings.

562
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,165
We have that kind of relationship.

563
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:30,546
That's right. We do or we don't.
It takes two to tango.

564
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,092
- Dad...
- What?

565
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,725
Nothing.

566
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,609
I love you.

567
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:54,820
I love you too.

568
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:02,870
- Where's my paper?
- I forgot.

569
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:04,163
She forgot.

570
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,339
Miss Soprano. Come on in.

571
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,178
Shall we talk about your future?

572
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,540
He's our most famous alumnus.

573
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,815
Oh, here they are.
The two Ivy Leaguers!

574
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,692
How was it? Want to eat?

575
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:17,361
It was good. I gotta call Hunter.

576
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:23,283
- Gee, she spared me no boring detail.
- I'll be back!

577
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:26,120
What a trip. I'm beat.

578
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,123
What, New England? It's so gorgeous.

579
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:32,167
You still sound nasal,
but you look better.

580
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,503
Any cold pasta?

581
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:37,172
There was some ziti, but it got eaten.

582
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,843
The whole tray? From last Sunday?

583
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,513
Monsignor Jughead was here.

584
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,684
If you are referring to
Father Intintola, yes, he was.

585
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:53,272
- He spent the night here.
- Yeah, right.

586
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,315
Okay.

587
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,155
The priest spent the night here?
What happened?

588
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,282
- Nothing.
- Where was Anthony?

589
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,325
Sleeping over at Jason's.

590
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:09,872
The priest spent the night here,
nothing happened.

591
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:14,626
- You're telling me this because...?
- You might hear something.

592
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,962
His car was out front all night.

593
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:21,341
You know what? This is too fucked-up
for me even to think about.

594
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:30,100
What'd you guys do for 12 hours,
play "Name That Pope"?

595
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:35,105
- He gave me Communion.
- I'll bet he gave you Communion.

596
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,356
Excuse me?

597
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:40,527
The guy spends the night here,
and all he does is slip you a wafer?

598
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,072
- That's verging on sacrilege.
- I didn't mean to verge.

599
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,867
- Do you think I'm lying?
- It sounds...

600
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:51,872
Would I have told you if we did?
Do I look like the frigging <i>Thorn Bird</i>?

601
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,460
He's a fag. That's it.

602
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,005
Otherwise, I gotta question
what I'm hearing.

603
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,716
Tony, you are a sketch.

604
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:10,140
Oh, by the way, your therapist called.

605
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,434
Jennifer?

606
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,524
Carm!

607
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:24,029
I thought you'd think it was weird
if I saw a woman psychiatrist.

608
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:30,369
Carm, come on! It's just therapy,
that's all! We just talk!
