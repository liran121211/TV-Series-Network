1
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,400
Debbie, you got magic fingers.

2
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,361
I bet you give a great hand job.

3
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,696
Yeah, she does.

4
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,531
Hey, here's my baby.

5
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,993
Debbie, you gotta put her
on the A list. Really.

6
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,370
She rides better than Willie Shoemaker.

7
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,789
- Did she go to the whip?
- He's so crazy.

8
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,708
Only in the homestretch.

9
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,379
Another satisfied customer.

10
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,174
I think he's having a heart attack!

11
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,929
Don't move.

12
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,932
Go see if Dr. Mop-N-Glo is still here.

13
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,894
- Dr. Mop-N-Glo?
- Who?

14
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,104
Don't worry, he's a real doctor.

15
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,397
Dermatologist.

16
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,149
What's the matter?

17
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,777
Dr. Edelstein, looks like a heart attack.

18
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,945
I don't need no doctor.

19
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,281
It's just my back.

20
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,116
Nice and slow.

21
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,288
Grab the rail, grab the rail.
That's right.

22
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:47,000
Go easy, go easy now. That's it.

23
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,585
Nice and easy.

24
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,295
Nice and easy.

25
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,339
That's it, that's it.

26
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,675
Come on, that's it.

27
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,010
Hold the rail.

28
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,693
Eighty to you.

29
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,115
Fuck this.

30
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,117
Your back still bothering you?

31
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,123
FBI! Nobody move!

32
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,999
You believe this shit?

33
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,963
- Come on, it's a friendly card game.
- Relax, Jimmy.

34
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,883
If I wanted to bust up card games,
I'd have a doughnut in my mouth.

35
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:53,942
Derek, give him a hand.

36
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,289
- Get him!
- You! You!

37
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,297
Oh, my goodness.
Do you know what this is?

38
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,965
It's a fucking gun!

39
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,521
Fucking Jimmy's still in jail.

40
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,689
Don't mean shit.

41
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,484
I don't like it. This is how it starts.

42
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,611
I think it was a potluck raid.

43
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,696
Make it look like they're
earning their pay.

44
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,824
- I agree.
- But why would Pussy run?

45
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,077
He's out of breath lifting
his dick to take a leak.

46
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,207
Oh, Puss!

47
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,958
Your ears must be ringing.

48
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,502
Come on, run!

49
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,672
Ha, ha. You guys are a fucking riot.

50
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,635
We were gonna draw straws
to see who'd bail you out.

51
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,387
My wife did. I nearly strangled
her on the ride home.

52
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:08,266
My head's hurting, I got <i>agita</i>,
and on top of that...

53
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,393
...I threw my back out again.

54
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,021
Maybe it was that 10-yard dash.

55
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,398
We don't run, it's embarrassing.

56
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,068
- Those Federal pricks robbed me.
- What?

57
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,862
They grabbed four dimes from me.

58
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,281
You shouldn't carry that type of cash!

59
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,992
Never mind, I need a drink.

60
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,080
<i>Oh, Madonna! Che puzzo!</i>

61
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,666
Oh, Jesus!

62
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,014
This better be good. I was fishing.

63
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,268
What, no "How you been?
How's it doing, Vin?"

64
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,520
I thought we understood each other.

65
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:57,482
I don't care about you, your family
or whether you take it up the ass.

66
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,610
What's so important you
take me away from my boat?

67
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,779
Fuckface, where you going?

68
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,074
Why do you talk to me like this?
I do risky shit for you.

69
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,952
You're not doing charity work, remember?

70
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,456
All right, I'm sorry.

71
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,669
Hey, Vin, how you doing?
What do you got for me?

72
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,257
Bompensiero.

73
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,466
Pussy?

74
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,302
What about him?

75
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,846
He's wired for sound.

76
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,097
What?

77
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:33,476
I got it from a good source.
I thought you should know. All right?

78
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,396
- I'm sorry. I know you like him.
- Like him?

79
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,065
I fucking love him.

80
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,984
Now, who's your source?

81
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,196
He's on the force.
He's on the task force, all right?

82
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,700
Look, he's not lying to me.
He was in my wedding.

83
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,619
I want to see the report.

84
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,871
- I can't...
- I want to see the fucking 302!

85
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,041
All right, all right.
I'll see what I can do.

86
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,424
It doesn't make any sense.

87
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,178
Yeah, it does, Tone,
if you take the blinders off.

88
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:13,850
I'm in Homicide. I was told he moved
heavy H to pay for his kid's college.

89
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,436
Why would I know something like that?

90
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,731
Last spring, with that big
heroin bust, where was he?

91
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,901
He told you he was in Las Vegas.
Am I right?

92
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,196
I'm sorry, but that's where he was.
He was in Las Vegas.

93
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,324
He was in a Federal building,
cutting a deal.

94
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,995
Why did he walk so easy from
that thing the other day?

95
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,872
Known wiseguy, resisted arrest.

96
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,542
Who walks away from a thing
like that with low-ball bail?

97
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,337
Why would he do it?

98
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,883
He's facing a possible sentence
of "from now on," mandatory.

99
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,595
I know a lot of guys who can't
do that kind of time.

100
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,639
Who is this guy Pussy?

101
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,892
He's a man who loves
his family above all else.

102
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,895
Well, guess what?
That's their favorite target.

103
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,819
Ma, you sure? Because I'd be glad to...

104
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,866
Okay, that's fine.

105
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,412
I just said it's fine.

106
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,672
- Was that my mother?
- She's not coming.

107
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,883
- Like you expected different?
- I hoped.

108
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,262
Every year we have open house,
and she pulls the same shit.

109
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,431
It's negative attention-getting.

110
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,349
Maybe I should call her back.

111
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,227
That's what she wants you to do.
Come here.

112
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,063
You're being too nice.

113
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,399
Forget about her, she'll be fine.

114
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,319
Can you get the guys to help
you move the piano?

115
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,614
They're coming to get it because
some people don't play.

116
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,160
- I will.
- When? It's been gathering dust.

117
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,537
Oh, Puss! Come here!

118
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,999
Excuse me.

119
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,379
What do you need?

120
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,507
We gotta move this.
I want to slide it out of the way.

121
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,182
I can't.

122
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,142
The fucking thing's on wheels.

123
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,146
My back. I'm thinking about
going home, sitting in the tub.

124
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,232
You all right?

125
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,070
Yeah, it's just my back.
They got me on these elephant pills.

126
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,160
All right, go easy on them.

127
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,038
Go ahead, sit down. Take it easy.

128
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,424
Keep your eye on Pussy.
Something's wrong. He's not himself.

129
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,301
You're telling me?

130
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,096
He hasn't done his rounds in a week.

131
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,681
He's starting to look like an easy mark.

132
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:03,353
I told him, "Someone owes you money,
even if you gotta crawl, you get it."

133
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,857
I even told him to give me his list,
and I'll collect the fucking thing.

134
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,361
- What'd he say?
- He just nodded like a fucking retard.

135
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,862
It's those fucking Percs.

136
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,406
He's throwing them
in his mouth like M&M's.

137
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,284
There isn't even anything
wrong with his back.

138
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,829
What do you mean?

139
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,208
Remember when that guy hit me
with a pool cue and I fucked my neck up?

140
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,043
- Down at the Shore.
- Right.

141
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:31,631
I went to this doctor.
He works on the Jets when they get hurt.

142
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,049
That so?

143
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,594
He's fucking like the Jonas
Salk of backs. Anyway...

144
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,265
...I send Pussy to this doctor.
The guy gives him the works:

145
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:44,060
MRIs, CAT scans, dog scans, you name it.

146
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,938
He says there's not a thing
wrong with his back.

147
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,527
Then again, he says,
when it comes to backs...

148
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,280
...nobody knows anything, really.

149
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,658
You know, I was on a good run,
and then, boom!

150
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,495
It's like I'm walking down the street...

151
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,333
...and I'm looking up because I feel
like a safe's gonna land on my head.

152
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,544
A feeling of pending doom?

153
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,588
Let me ask you a question.

154
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:16,384
This mental stuff can cause
physical problems, right?

155
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,761
Are you having any physical problems?

156
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,555
No, no, I'm fine.

157
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,224
But I got a friend...

158
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,896
...a dear, dear friend,
and I'm concerned about him.

159
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,689
What's wrong with him?

160
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,399
It's his back.

161
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,278
See, he's complaining about his back...

162
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,864
...but the doctor thinks it's all in his head.

163
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,200
That's very possible.

164
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,660
What do you think?

165
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,455
I think we should just
keep this about you.

166
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,998
This is about me.

167
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,212
Every time I offer my opinion
about any of your friends...

168
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,924
...it seems to interfere with our therapy.

169
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,802
You start cursing and screaming.

170
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,682
What kind of mental stuff
would cause a backache?

171
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,809
For conversation's sake?

172
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,561
Absolutely.

173
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,858
With some people, the pain is...

174
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:18,488
...caused by more responsibility
than they can handle.

175
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,366
Well, that makes sense. I mean...

176
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,995
...he's got a lot of bills, a lot of problems
with his kid's school fund.

177
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,206
Secrets.

178
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,001
What do you mean?

179
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,755
Psychologically, a secret is a heavy load.

180
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:40,093
It leads to feelings of guilt,
which further burden the mind.

181
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,108
If you want my opinion,
this can't be true.

182
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,776
Thanks, Debbie.

183
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,868
You know, I told you that
I would do what I could...

184
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:10,707
...but this is DEA, Feds, task force.

185
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,293
This is not as easy as you think.

186
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,545
Getting my hands on the 302.

187
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,380
Now, you listen to me.

188
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,050
This is the most serious decision
I've ever had to make.

189
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,011
And I need proof.

190
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,015
I won't hurt a man that I love
because of some cop gossip...

191
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,226
...from a degenerate fucking
gambler with a badge.

192
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,355
You know, you got an amazing
ability to sum up...

193
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,400
...a man's whole life in a single sentence.

194
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:41,029
Degenerate gambler with a badge, huh?

195
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,741
You're a pisser. You're a real pisser.

196
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,745
I'm under pressure.
I don't have time to suck your dick!

197
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,955
Apology accepted.

198
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,832
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

199
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,417
Yeah, fuck you!

200
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,796
You know, when I was a kid...

201
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:03,259
When I was a kid and my old man
would be in one of his ways...

202
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,928
...with the screaming back and forth...

203
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,973
...it'd end with her throwing
the closest thing to her.

204
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,768
He'd smack her around!

205
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,938
I don't know why...

206
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:20,276
...but I would run into my room
and I would hide under my bed.

207
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:25,907
There was something peaceful and
something safe under that bed.

208
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,286
And that's where I would
wake up the next day.

209
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,998
Everything back to normal.

210
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,751
How about you?

211
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,963
Do you ever feel like hiding under a bed?

212
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,593
Yeah. Right now.

213
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,600
You're a prick to the end, right?

214
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,192
You really like this place, huh?

215
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,820
It's my getaway.

216
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,948
This is where Debbie's taken
care of me for years.

217
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,658
I'll bet she has.

218
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,160
I'm serious, she has.

219
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,914
There were times when I had a great
weekend with the football...

220
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,584
...and I'd come here with a pocketful
of money, shitfaced...

221
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,588
...and every fucking penny would be
there when I got up in the morning.

222
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,341
She is an honest lady.

223
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,718
She'd do anything for you, anything.

224
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,347
You come in here, you flash
your badge, you get free pussy.

225
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:35,518
Fuck pussy. I wouldn't fuck one
of these broads with your dick.

226
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,814
They have absolutely no class,
and they're always on the hustle.

227
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,358
That's what they're supposed to do, no?

228
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,833
"Oh, hello, Carmela.
How nice to see you."

229
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,711
How are you feeling?

230
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,422
Oh, what can I say? What's that?

231
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,717
It's a <i>ricotta</i> pie.
I saved it from the open house.

232
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,427
Are you wearing makeup?

233
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,721
I can't eat that. It's got cholesterol!

234
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,682
I made it with the low-fat cheese.

235
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,730
Well, maybe your friends will eat it.

236
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,191
What friends?

237
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,569
Fine, you can eat it when Junior visits.

238
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,283
You know, your son loves you very much.

239
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,827
He worries all the time.

240
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,039
He felt bad that you didn't
come to the open house.

241
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,833
I don't care if you think
it's disrespectful...

242
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,295
...but I want you to cut the drama.
It's killing Tony.

243
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,880
What are you talking about?

244
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,550
I'm talking about this "Poor mother,
nobody loves me" crap.

245
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,677
It is textbook manipulation...

246
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,639
...and I hate seeing Tony so upset over it.

247
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,099
I know how to talk to people.

248
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,228
Well, I am a mother too, don't forget.

249
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,106
You know your power,
and you use it like a pro.

250
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,528
Power, what power?
I don't have power. I'm a shut-in!

251
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,321
You are bigger than life!

252
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,906
You are his mother!

253
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,825
I think that you know what you're doing.

254
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,620
Who, me? What did I do?

255
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,040
Look, I didn't come by to argue.

256
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,669
I came by to check on you
and to bring you the <i>ricotta</i>.

257
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,756
If you don't want it, give it to Junior.
I know he stops by a lot.

258
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,342
He's my husband's brother.

259
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,637
He can't check up on me once in a while?

260
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,847
That's none of anybody's business.

261
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,349
I am not saying that.

262
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,310
I'm saying if you don't want it,
give it to Junior.

263
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,646
I know what you're hinting at.

264
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,983
Ma, there is nothing wrong
with companionship!

265
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,405
What is wrong?

266
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,872
Wait until you're abandoned.

267
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,753
Abandoned? Please!

268
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,759
When Johnny was alive...

269
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,138
...nobody treated me like this.

270
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,099
What are you talking about?
Who is treating you bad?

271
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,810
Tony would rather die than see you hurt.

272
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,688
Johnny was a saint.

273
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:26,856
Yes, we heard.

274
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,568
Funny, I don't remember you telling
him that when he was alive.

275
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,738
Junior couldn't carry Johnny's socks.

276
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,033
Do you think I'd blacken
my Johnny's memory...

277
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,369
...by getting mixed up with his brother?

278
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,123
I didn't say that.

279
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,501
We're only happy you and
Junior get along so well.

280
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,295
At least with Junior...

281
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,384
...I've got some purpose in life.

282
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,223
Somebody listens to me and doesn't
treat me like an old shoe!

283
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,731
Jesus!

284
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,696
Don't worry about the dish.
I'll come back tomorrow and get it.

285
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,580
Hey, college boy!

286
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,671
Yo, Dad! It's Uncle Tony.

287
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,511
There he is, the beached whale!

288
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,555
Hey, Tony, what are you doing here?

289
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,558
I figured you'd be having
a cannoli withdrawal by now.

290
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,726
Spinellis?

291
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,396
No, Stop 'N' Shop. What do you think?

292
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,982
Hey, you're the best.
Hey, Kev, put those on a dish.

293
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,360
Wait till after supper.

294
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,822
Your dad tells me you're
taking astronomy in college.

295
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,281
No, business.

296
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,493
How come he keeps saying you're
taking up space in school?

297
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,123
<i>Madonna!</i> Don't make me laugh.
It kills my back.

298
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,125
He's a good-looking kid.

299
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,292
Sure he's yours?

300
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,713
You're lucky my wife's not home.
She'd toss you out for that.

301
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,214
I know.

302
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,091
That's a good boy.

303
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,094
I pray to God I keep
that tuition coming in.

304
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,971
He can go to city college.

305
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:26,475
He's staying where he is.
He isn't getting fucked because his old man is!

306
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,315
You ought to relax.
You ought to take it easy a little.

307
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,485
Take it easy.
How the fuck can I take it easy?

308
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,362
Things are happening, Tony.

309
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,197
What kind of things?

310
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,699
Things!

311
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,704
This back has taken me out
of the game. I'm behind.

312
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,374
And I think I'm getting hooked
on these fucking painkillers!

313
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,669
I don't know, I feel like someone
put the <i>malocchio</i> on me.

314
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,506
Puss...

315
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,050
...you got options.

316
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,845
Don't let anyone make you feel...

317
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,015
...like you don't have options
because you got friends.

318
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,725
Look at me.

319
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,186
Friends that would die for you.

320
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,021
You understand me?

321
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,981
Friends.

322
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,484
Yeah, I know.

323
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,324
You got anything you
want to say to me?

324
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,494
Like what?

325
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,334
Like, "You want some coffee?
You want something to eat?"

326
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,544
- You want coffee?
- Yeah.

327
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,423
You think I'd let you eat
those cannolis by yourself?

328
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,008
You beached whale.

329
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,301
- Here.
- What?

330
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,720
Help me. Who'll make the coffee, you?

331
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,723
One, two, three.

332
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,060
You look good.

333
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,584
What's up, T?

334
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,545
Sit.

335
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,507
Fucking traffic!

336
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,968
I would have been here 20 minutes ago.

337
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,096
Want a drink?

338
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,935
You okay?

339
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,064
He's wearing a wire.

340
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,691
Who?

341
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,067
Pussy.

342
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,946
Oh, get the fuck out of here.
Our Pussy?

343
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,031
Don't know how long.

344
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,701
Are you sure about this, Tony?

345
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,453
Ninety percent.

346
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,457
Not enough to do what needs to be done.

347
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,960
Jesus! I'm fucking dreaming here.

348
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,962
Well, get used to it.

349
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,132
I've been walking into walls all week.

350
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,140
I'll do it.

351
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,314
My responsibility.

352
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,817
You waited a long time for the stripes.

353
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,944
This is one of the perks.

354
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,864
I'll do it.

355
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,167
We need to be 110 percent sure.

356
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,794
I want you to see it.

357
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,298
I want you to see that fucking
wire strapped on his body.

358
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,216
I want you to see it.

359
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,927
You hear me?

360
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,803
I want you to see it.

361
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,265
Otherwise, all bets are off.

362
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,809
You understand?

363
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,317
This is our friend we're
talking about here.

364
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,944
You say it.

365
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,571
You understand?

366
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,199
I understand.

367
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,556
Come in.

368
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,477
Mr. Soprano.

369
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,398
- Are you busy?
- No, no, no. Come in, please.

370
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:49,905
I was in the neighborhood,
figured I'd stop by and see my mother.

371
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,075
Brought her some Mario Lanza.

372
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,412
She loves the old guys.

373
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:04,253
I'm a little worried about her.
You know, she's always been depressed.

374
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,965
Sometimes these half-assed
tenors can really do the trick.

375
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,557
You know where she is?
She's not in her room.

376
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,601
I wanted to tell her
her house went into escrow.

377
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,438
She's with the other girls
getting aqua therapy.

378
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,605
My mother?

379
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,609
The physical therapist told her
if she didn't get exercise...

380
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,070
...her back was gonna
arch like an old lady.

381
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,114
I didn't know she had a bathing suit.

382
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,241
She's more connected to the world.

383
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,285
Which one, this one or Neptune?

384
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,121
No, really.

385
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,834
I think your uncle's visits
have a lot to do with it.

386
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,378
Oh, she looks forward to them.

387
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,714
Could you excuse me one moment?

388
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,051
Yeah, sure. You know, just...

389
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:56,472
Tell her her house sold and they
accepted the counteroffer.

390
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,266
Okay. Yeah, I'll be right there.

391
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,478
- I'm leaving, guys.
- See you later, Pussy.

392
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,356
- I'll tell you if that horse runs.
- Don't do me any favors.

393
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,181
Follow me.

394
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,183
Where?

395
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,060
It's a surprise.

396
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,482
Come on, you hard-on,
before we get a ticket.

397
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,955
Paulie, I've been here before.
What the fuck you want?

398
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,415
Look around, I'll give you three guesses.

399
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,459
Come on, down here.

400
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,549
We'll grab a rubdown after.

401
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,467
Here.

402
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,512
I don't know.

403
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,223
Come on, get undressed. It's on me.

404
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,393
Why do you think those
Russians live so long?

405
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,020
They take a <i>schvitz</i> every day.

406
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,480
I can't.

407
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,859
Don't be like that. It's a gift.
Take your clothes off.

408
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,194
What? Want me to turn around?

409
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:38,574
The doctor said heat's no good for me.
That's why I sit in the shade.

410
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,869
What are you talking about?
Heat is good for your back!

411
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,912
Take your clothes off!

412
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,583
Look, Paulie, I appreciate it.
Maybe another time, huh?

413
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,377
Take your clothes off.

414
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,548
You're fucking crazy. I'm going home.

415
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,761
Why don't you want
to take your clothes off?

416
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:04,224
I got high blood pressure!
I go in there, I could check out!

417
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,936
My doctor mentioned steam and
sauna specifically as no-noes.

418
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,606
He said stay the fuck away from heat!

419
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,611
Thanks for the thought.
But get out of my fucking face.

420
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,550
What'd you find out?

421
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,221
It's good. It's fucking very good!

422
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,556
Spit it out.

423
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,017
He's into Pussy, big.

424
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,561
And I mean with a capital B.

425
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,690
This fucking Makazian,
he's a lying motherfucker!

426
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:58,528
He's into Pussy for 30 large.
Twenty grand, just on football!

427
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,572
And the rest is shy.

428
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:04,159
Pussy must be burying
his prick in vig alone.

429
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,919
Doesn't mean he's a liar.

430
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:18,507
Just means he's got a reason to see
Pussy dead. It buys him time.

431
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:24,179
Could this prick have the balls
to try something like this?

432
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,015
Hey, we're talking about 30 grand here!

433
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,852
I don't even want to think about
what we'd do to remove that debt.

434
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,063
I wouldn't bet football.

435
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,152
I gotta think about this.

436
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,489
Look, T...

437
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,033
...if my vote counts for anything...

438
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,954
...I cannot believe that Pussy
would fear the can enough...

439
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,998
...to hurt his friends.

440
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,002
That's what they said about Gravano.

441
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,966
All right, go back in.
I gotta think.

442
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,564
Deb?

443
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,735
Debbie?

444
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,872
- Take it easy with her.
- I'd think a whore would like pain.

445
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,749
- Take it easy!
- Vinnie, stop it!

446
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,418
Come on, let's get this show on the road!

447
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,421
Look at this. A doctor, a madam,
a wiseguy and a cop.

448
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:42,424
That's what I call a vice superfecta.

449
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,556
<i>The four were arrested last night.</i>

450
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:54,227
<i>A spokesman says that the officer
in question will be placed on leave...</i>

451
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,397
<i>...pending the outcome
of the hearing this morning.</i>

452
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,608
<i>Hate to be there when he got home.</i>

453
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,360
<i>I don't know which is worse:</i>

454
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,197
<i>To be caught in a bordello
or to be caught with the wiseguy.</i>

455
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,949
Asshole!

456
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,994
- What's a bordello?
- A fancy name for a whorehouse.

457
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,830
- Don't start, okay?
- It is!

458
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,957
I just don't like that talk.

459
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:20,295
Most civilized countries have
legalized prostitution.

460
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,838
You got somewhere to be?

461
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,007
It's a joke, look at the president.

462
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,634
He deserved what he got.

463
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,804
He got Monica Kazinski and
the broad with the long nose.

464
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,181
Sex shouldn't be a punishable offense.

465
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,559
I don't think sex should be
a punishable offense either.

466
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,814
But talking about sex at the breakfast
table is a punishable offense.

467
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,732
No more sex talk, okay?

468
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:44,653
It's the '90s, parents are supposed
to discuss sex with their children.

469
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,822
But that's where you're wrong.

470
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,867
You see, out there, it's the 1990s,
but in this house...

471
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,869
...it's 1954.

472
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,039
1990s, 1954.

473
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,751
So now and forever, I don't want
to hear any more sex talk.

474
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,174
What's with him?

475
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,187
Keep moving, please.

476
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,606
Come on!

477
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,001
Come on, goddamn it!

478
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,086
Come on, let's go, let's go!

479
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,213
Let's go!

480
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,265
Go ahead, detective.

481
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,977
Excuse me, move it out, please.
Got a police officer here.

482
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,898
Move it out! Let's go! Pull up!

483
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,652
Police vehicle! Coming through!

484
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,118
Are you sure? Who told you this?

485
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,455
What?

486
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,129
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

487
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:12,759
All right, thanks.
I'll talk to you later.

488
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,973
You gonna tell me?

489
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,726
The fucking jerk did a header
off the Route 1 bridge.

490
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,271
- Who?
- Makazian.

491
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,481
Fuck!

492
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:31,778
There goes our only shot to find out
for sure the truth about Pussy.

493
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:39,661
Well, if it matters, he always said
how much he respected you.

494
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:41,288
It matters.

495
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:49,421
He helped me out of a lot of jams.
Not just with the law.

496
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,757
What was he thinking?

497
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:56,428
He could've kept his job.
He might have been suspended, that's all.

498
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,221
It's not like he was dealing.

499
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,015
That's not why he did it.

500
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,019
Don't get me wrong, it was the straw...

501
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,646
...but he was not happy...

502
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,858
...with himself, how he turned out.

503
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,527
What did he come here for, therapy?

504
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,988
You could say that.

505
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,324
Instead of a couch, you use a bed?

506
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,867
It's not a bad deal.

507
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,620
Who wouldn't want to sleep
with their shrink?

508
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,541
What's that mean?

509
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,921
You'd be amazed how easy it is
to open up when you're naked...

510
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,924
...and in the arms of someone
who cares for you.

511
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:40,263
Did he ever mention anything
about my guys to you?

512
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,893
He didn't like Paulie.
He thought he was a psycho.

513
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,853
What about Pussy?

514
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:50,523
He really didn't have much
to say about any of you guys.

515
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,737
Except that he owed some money.

516
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,865
But he wasn't worried
because you liked him...

517
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:04,746
...and while he had you in his corner,
there was nothing to worry about.

518
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:10,710
I won't lie, he's dead. He didn't have
a good thing to say about anyone.

519
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,755
He did feel like he could trust you.

520
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:21,721
He said a lot, "At least with Tony Soprano,
you know where you stand."

521
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,233
Livia, open up, it's Junior!

522
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,486
Come on in, it's open.

523
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,116
What's going on?

524
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,077
My Dominican girl said you called me.

525
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,538
Well...

526
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,708
...he sold our house.

527
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,211
- Don't people have names? Who's "he"?
- Anthony.

528
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,964
He sold my house!

529
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,217
The home my husband and I made!

530
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,970
What else were they gonna do with it?

531
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,805
You too!

532
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:11,771
I suppose he would've found it harder
to have his meetings at my house...

533
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,023
...than in this nursing home.

534
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,151
What are you talking about?

535
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,738
Don't think I'll ever see any
of that money, either.

536
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,905
What meetings?

537
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,158
Raymond, Larry!

538
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,910
That sneak from Manhattan.

539
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,496
Johnny Sack? Johnny Sack was here?

540
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,708
With his mohair suits and his shoe lifts.

541
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,252
Suits, pleurisy?

542
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:38,214
More than once he was there?
Why didn't I know about this?

543
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,843
Maybe it was you they were
talking about, who knows?

544
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:54,147
Well, I just don't like being
put in the middle of things!

545
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,109
I should've known
something was strange...

546
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,572
...when suddenly Larry Boy's
mother moved in here.

547
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,201
And then Jimmy Altieri's mother.

548
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,037
Three of my capos have their moms here?

549
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,124
Instead of living in normal
homes with their sons...

550
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,876
...like human beings.

551
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,670
This must be some kind
of fucking end move.

552
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,799
What do they think, I'm stupid?

553
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,759
- We'll see.
- Wait a minute!

554
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,763
I don't like that kind of talk!

555
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,474
Now just stop it, it upsets me!

556
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,436
Or I won't tell you anything anymore.

557
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,857
If this is true, Livia,
you know what I... I mean...

558
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,987
I'm the boss, for chrissake!
If I don't act, blood or no...

559
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,831
I have to.

560
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,625
Oh, God, why?

561
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,711
What did I say now?

562
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,138
I suppose I should've just kept
my mouth shut, like a mute.

563
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,433
And then everybody would've been happy.

564
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,572
Anthony, see who's there.

565
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:26,990
I'm eating.

566
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,535
You won't have any teeth
left if you don't go see!

567
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,502
Make sure you know who
it is before you answer.

568
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,463
Who is coming at dinner?
People can't call?

569
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,300
It's Uncle Jimmy!

570
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,595
Uncle Jimmy? Let him in!

571
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,685
I don't believe it, how'd you get out?

572
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,396
Carm, look who's here!
Jimmy, he's out!

573
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,481
Oh, my God, Jimmy!

574
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,192
- Thought you'd never see me again?
- What happened?

575
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:07,155
- Got someplace in private we can talk?
- Yeah, in the basement.

576
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,369
What's going on?

577
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,540
You got a problem!

578
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,170
Yeah, I know. I'm working on it.

579
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,005
Working on what?

580
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,674
Why, what were you gonna say?

581
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,719
You better lay low with that
safe-house money.

582
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,054
What?

583
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,182
They were asking me a lot
of questions in there.

584
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,353
If I knew anything about the dead
Colombian in the apartment.

585
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,068
You look good.

586
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,572
- Thanks, I wasn't gone that long.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

587
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,910
My lawyer told him,
"Hey, he doesn't own the building.

588
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,704
He's not responsible for what's in it."

589
00:40:56,913 --> 00:41:00,416
I told him the pool table was there
when I first rented the joint.

590
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,710
Good thinking.

591
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,629
You should've been a lawyer.

592
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,549
Please, enough people hate me.

593
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:14,347
So what are you gonna do
about the Colombian money?

594
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,853
They were putting it to me
like I was a kid.

595
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,064
Telling me the money was marked.

596
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:28,111
They said there's a new fingerprint
technique, lifts them off the bills.

597
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,659
You're a lucky man, Jimmy!

598
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,160
What do you mean?

599
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,871
You're out on bail on that
conspiracy thing?

600
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,039
Yeah, so?

601
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:43,918
Only you would get pinched with a gun
while you're out on bail...

602
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,254
...and still be out in time for dinner.

603
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,049
You're a lucky guy!

604
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,553
Speaking of dinner, Carmela's
got some lasagna upstairs.

605
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,598
I'll pass. I got a few people to see
that are late with payments.

606
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,436
I gotta show my face or they'll
think they're off the hook.

607
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:11,446
Get off the phone!

608
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,947
I gotta go!

609
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,284
- What's up?
- It's Jimmy! It's fucking Jimmy!

610
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,702
What?

611
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,080
- The wire, it's Jimmy!
- What are you talking about?

612
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:25,001
The wire, you understand?
The wire, it's fucking Jimmy!

613
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:29,630
I should've killed him right
in my fucking basement!

614
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:33,384
Makazian's guy got mixed up.
They got busted at the same time.

615
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,637
Jimmy and Pussy! You understand?

616
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,809
Two fat fucks with black hair!
Where the fuck is Paulie?

617
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,396
He called an hour ago.
He said he's on his way.

618
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,690
Why the fuck isn't he here now?

619
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,652
Jesus, Tony.

620
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,530
You don't think Paulie jumped the gun?

621
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,657
Shut up. God forbid.

622
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,951
Don't talk like that.

623
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,872
Where's Pussy? Get him on the phone.

624
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,628
I haven't seen him since Paulie
took him to the <i>schvitz</i>.

625
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:09,921
Hey, fellas!

626
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,635
I've been calling you
all fucking night long!

627
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,513
I was at my <i>goomar's</i>.
I told Silvio I was coming.

628
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:22,058
You answer me like I'm
Jesus Christ himself...

629
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,228
...if you lie, may your mother
die of cancer of the eyes.

630
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,691
- Where's Pussy?
- I don't know.

631
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,111
- Don't you fucking lie to me!
- Tony!

632
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,698
Did you do it?

633
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,036
Don't fucking lie to me.

634
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,041
- Did you do it?
- No.

635
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,460
- Did you fucking do it?
- No.

636
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,546
Did you fucking do it?

637
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:55,800
I said no! Now get your
fucking hands off of me.

638
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,635
Come on, Tony.

639
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,783
I'm sorry, Paulie.

640
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,746
I can't find Pussy anywhere!

641
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,083
Nobody knows anything!

642
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,670
I haven't seen him since the <i>schvitz</i>.

643
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:38,050
The last thing he said to me was,
"Go fuck yourself!"

644
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,262
Did he at least take the <i>schvitz</i>?

645
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,643
He refused to take his clothes off.

646
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,734
The rat...

647
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,819
...it's fucking Jimmy!

648
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:05,411
Fuck it! Let's all have a drink!

649
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,797
All right.

650
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,133
Hey, babe!

651
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,222
Look what Chucky brought us!

652
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,517
Another kitchen appliance.
Whoop-fucking-pee!

653
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,020
Well, slit your wrists, why don't ya?

654
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:34,023
Truckload fell off
the loading dock at Zim's.

655
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,817
It's not even a Bra-oon.

656
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,487
That's a "Braun," babe.

657
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,031
Junior said for me to tell you...

658
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,659
...he's decided on that thing.

659
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,828
He said we should look out of town
for who's gonna do it.

660
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,538
- Finally.
- Yeah.

661
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,584
It's gonna be a busy month.

662
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,670
- I'll see you.
- See you later.

663
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:57,880
See you, Jo.

664
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,674
Yeah, see you.

665
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,721
What was he talking about?

666
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,809
- Mind your business.
- Whatever it is, Mikey...

667
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,686
...we're going to Vegas.

668
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:15,564
I already lined up childcare,
so I don't want to hear it.

669
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,234
Forget it, something's come up.

670
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,029
Something always comes up.

671
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,365
This is a good something.

672
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,535
Hope it means more money
because I need a new car.

673
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:28,703
Trust me.

674
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:32,373
If this goes down, you'll have
a new car, and then some.

675
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,668
Can you tell me?

676
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:40,339
Oh, come on, Mikey! Tell me.

677
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,216
Come on, please?

678
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,972
I may be getting bumped up,
a notch or two!

679
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,810
Tony Soprano's on his way out,
and I mean as in "forever."

680
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,146
Oh, my God!

681
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:56,689
He's going to jail?

682
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,899
No, the other forever!

683
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,402
Does Junior know?

684
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,863
Oh, Jesus!

685
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,616
Listen, if you breathe
a word of this to anybody...

686
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,662
...they'll bury me and you right next
to Tony Soprano, understand?

687
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,541
Make it decaf.

688
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,090
You don't belittle a man
like Junior Soprano.

689
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:24,675
He's old-school.

690
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,887
You don't joke about cunt-lapping,
and you don't...

691
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:32,391
...spill your guts out to a shrink
about business that isn't yours!

692
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,435
Tony Soprano sees a shrink?

693
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,855
You fucking believe that?
To add insult to injury...

694
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:40,399
...he was planning a move against Junior!

695
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:41,984
His own uncle?

696
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,156
Were you this stupid when I married you?

697
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:48,908
Fuck you!

698
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,745
No, fuck you. What are you doing
standing there? Make the coffee!

699
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,956
Take it easy, take it easy.
It's brewing.
