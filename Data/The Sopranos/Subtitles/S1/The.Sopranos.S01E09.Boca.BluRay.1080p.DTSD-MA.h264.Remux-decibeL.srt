1
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,156
<i>In the Czech Republic too, we love pork.</i>

2
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,034
<i>Ever had our sausages?</i>

3
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,709
<i>In the Czech Republic too, we love pork.</i>

4
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,629
<i>You ever had our sausages?</i>

5
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,193
Adriana?

6
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:35,113
<i>In the Czech Republic too, we love pork.
Ever had our sausages?</i>

7
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,370
Emil Kolar?

8
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,833
- Help you?
- Salami sub, hold the mayo.

9
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,877
We're out of mayo.

10
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,925
Change my meat to black forest.

11
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,395
You killed me.

12
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,188
What do you want me to do?

13
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,606
I want to tell you.

14
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,733
What? You come here every night.

15
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,485
You fucked up.

16
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,612
What do you mean?

17
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,198
Here's these.

18
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,242
Where'd you find them?

19
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,453
One in the table. Three in my skull.

20
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,625
You will have our sausages.

21
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,419
Get rid of these.

22
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,005
Let go of me! Let go!

23
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,853
- I would've wrapped it...
- That's okay. A computer!

24
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,815
This one got such a good write-up,
I got one for myself.

25
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,152
- Let's move on, okay?
- Congratulations. God bless.

26
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,326
You look gorgeous. Who's your date?

27
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,412
What do you mean, "Who's your date?"

28
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,748
- Good to see you.
- Congratulations.

29
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,001
- Thank you.
- Melissa was beautiful up there.

30
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,754
Oh, Mama Livia, <i>come stai</i>, darling?

31
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,631
Listen to him, with that "my darling."

32
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,301
I am nobody's darling.

33
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,428
She never disappoints you.

34
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,389
Are you still seeing your
other women, Lorenzo?

35
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,309
Come on, Ma, let's mingle.

36
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,228
Sorry, the older she gets,
the worse she gets.

37
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,191
I heard disturbing shit last night.
I wanted to talk to you.

38
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:38,028
But with the rehearsal dinner
and everything, you know...

39
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,614
There's the priest.
I'll be right back.

40
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,798
Federal indictments?
Where the fuck did you get this?

41
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:03,094
I got a guy, his <i>goomar</i> works at FBI
headquarters as a word processor.

42
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,721
When's it coming down?

43
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,724
I don't know.
When she knows, she'll tell me.

44
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,310
- Indictments? What the fuck?
- You sure?

45
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,981
It ain't just my source in Jersey.
Half of New York moved to Fort Lauderdale.

46
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,609
Fuck! They're gonna want my ass.

47
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,236
Why?

48
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,571
What do you mean, why? I'm O.C.

49
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,615
When'd you get your wings?

50
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,786
I didn't. Not yet, anyway.

51
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,122
Uncle Junior, you got anything to say?

52
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,501
You guys see indictments
under your bed at night.

53
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,255
You're ready to lam it.
As far as I'm concerned, it's speculation.

54
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,048
It's rumor.

55
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,635
Better be safe than sorry.
I say we duck for a while.

56
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,013
What're we gonna do, close shop?
We can't do that.

57
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,015
Tony, what do you think?

58
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:54,396
What the fuck are you asking him for?
I just gave you the answer.

59
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,650
He's right, we go, it's open season.
Albanians will be living in our houses.

60
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,862
I just gave a G-note to
Larry Boy's kid for the boost.

61
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,198
If I have to lam in a hurry,
I'd have duped her another time.

62
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:17,794
I gotta go. It's an emergency.
Say goodbye to your father for me.

63
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,467
I agree with my uncle.
He calls the shots, we do it.

64
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,429
Well, maybe for today, for right now...

65
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,558
...you were thinking that everybody
should do spring cleaning?

66
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,560
That was my next comment.

67
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,348
Think they'll come over the weekend?

68
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,683
They're coming someday.

69
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,191
- Where's the rest of the money?
- Everywhere.

70
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,817
Get it.

71
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,865
- What else?
- How about your phone numbers?

72
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,743
Anybody who's anybody's in my head.

73
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,836
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Just, here we go.

74
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,421
Here.

75
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:49,219
Why now? Why the fuck now,
just when things were going good?

76
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,981
- Boot your computer, cops are coming.
- So?

77
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,942
You want them to see that
porno you downloaded?

78
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,495
Better give me your jewelry.

79
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,289
Oh, Jesus!

80
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,085
We can't produce receipts.
You want them stealing it?

81
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,466
Come on.

82
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,136
Not my engagement ring.
This isn't stolen.

83
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,972
Is it?

84
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,724
No.

85
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,809
What do you think I am?

86
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,730
Come on, give me that!

87
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,300
Adriana!

88
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,888
It ate my whole script now!

89
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,352
You're still on the file.
You deleted the text.

90
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,105
The fuck... Whatever.
You fucking asshole!

91
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,275
Stop with the hysteria, would you please?

92
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,988
If you're gonna keep behaving like
a baby, I'm not gonna help you.

93
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,156
I mean it.

94
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,659
At least you work that squirrel
program in the restaurant.

95
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,915
There, the text came back.

96
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,502
- You put it in buffer memory.
- What do you think?

97
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,420
Of the script?

98
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,591
Babe, I can't give an opinion
every time you add a sentence.

99
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,302
I gotta have the whole story flow.

100
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,429
I'm starting with the dialogue.

101
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,526
"I manuged to get the drop on him"?

102
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,654
Do you mean, "I managed
to get the drop on him"?

103
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,825
Or is he saying "<i>manuge</i>,"
like <i>mannuggia l'americano</i>?

104
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,128
My Tennessee William.

105
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,967
Where you going?

106
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,053
Get over here.

107
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,558
I have never seen you
apply yourself like this.

108
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,769
I love movies. You know that.

109
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,188
That smell in Blockbuster...

110
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,025
...that candy and carpet smell,
I get high off it.

111
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,404
Gonna let all this love and
knowledge go to waste?

112
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,741
My cousin Gregory's girlfriend, Amy,
who works for Tarantino, said:

113
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:03,329
"Mob stories are always hot."
I can make my mark.

114
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:09,961
With these indictments, shouldn't you
put the script away for a while...

115
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,255
...and get rid of evidence?

116
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,426
Travel light. Free bird.

117
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:21,598
You stole this computer,
plus the one you just gave Melissa.

118
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,144
I'm writing.

119
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,645
Turn on channel 6.

120
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,772
Turn on channel 6.

121
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,613
<i>New Jersey Attorney General,
James Ricci, stated at a fundraiser...</i>

122

<i>...possible Mob activities in the
Garden State with indictments to follow.</i>

124

America's Longest-Running
Soap Opera, <i>Jeffrey Wernick</i>.

126
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,838
<i>- Welcome.
- Pleasure to be here.</i>

127
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,092
<i>For years, the FBI has been telling us
that the Mafia is all but dead.</i>

128
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,594

129
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:04,724
<i>While it is true that the Mob is

130
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,603
<i>...I wouldn't call the fight.
The government knows this best.</i>

<i>Murder, truck hijacking and money
laundering are expected inquiries.</i>

133
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,239

136

138
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,339
<i>What about possible murder charges?</i>

00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,134

- Interesting.</i>

142
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,604
No one would have ranked him
as associate!

143
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,399
<i>...a loyal soldier, and he winds up dead...</i>

144
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,234
Soldier?

145
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,654
Brendan Filone? Associate?
Soldier? Fuck you!

146
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,197
Jesus!

147
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,918
Did you see it from the beginning?
Did they mention my name?

148
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:19,173
Stop the fucking chitchat, all right?
I gotta go.

149
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,764
Nobody makes <i>guinso</i> gravy like you, Nana.

150
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,393
You know, I'm up at Bard
waiting for my care package.

151
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,395
I don't like that word, Jason.

152
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,646
What, <i>guinso</i>?

153
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,983
- The word is offensive!
- She's right, Jason.

154
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,610
Sorry, Nana. What's it mean?

155
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,863
- It's from <i>guinea</i>.
- What's that?

156
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,948
It's a derogation.

157
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,869
I have a patient.
You wouldn't say <i>guinea</i> to him.

158
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,415
Italian male seeing a shrink.
Let me guess: mother issues.

159
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,584
- Why wouldn't you?
- Just wouldn't.

160
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,086
You'd be scared?
Is he in the Mafia?

161
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:01,299
No, I shouldn't have mentioned it!
Can we change the subject?

162
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,552
No way. Mom, is he in the Mob, or what?

163
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,596
He's not a mobster, is he?

164
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,808
Nobody knows better than you, Richard.
I can't discuss my patients.

165
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,771
I just hope he's not one of those
crumbs on the news.

166
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,567
Just refer him to another doctor.
You can do that, couldn't you?

167
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,527
Grate the cheese, Dad.

168
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,529
Sure she can.

169
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,241
That might be what you would do, Richard.

170
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,786
Now I remember why we got divorced.

171
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,373
Why refer him to another doctor?
He's my patient.

172
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:37,377
You can't treat sociopaths.
You shouldn't help scum with bed-wetting.

173
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:41,047
You have no idea who this man is,
and yet you call him scum.

174
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,842
People like him are the reason
Italian-Americans have a bad image.

175
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,302
I agree.

176
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:50,223
Ask any American to describe
an Italian-American in this country...

177
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:54,811
...invariably he's gonna reference
<i>The Godfather, Goodfellas</i>...

178
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,270
Good movies.

179
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,441
- ...and the rest will mention pizza.
- Good movies to eat pizza by.

180
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,986
Stop it, Jason!
I never said he was in the Mafia.

181
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,197
We'll never see an Italian president.

182
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,408
And that's my patient's fault?

183
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,537
I realize that you're involved
in the Anti-Defamation lobby.

184
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:17,625
So go after Hollywood if you feel you must.
But leave my patient alone.

185
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,085
It's a synergy.

186
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,880
News items and the portrayal
of Italian-Americans as gangsters!

187
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:28,219
Wasn't the Italian Anti-Def deal started
by Joe Colombo? A mobster?

188
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,097
Italians Against Discrimination did a study.

189
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,642
In its height, the Mafia in the U.S.
had less than 5000 members.

190
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,812
And yet, that tiny, insignificant fraction...

191
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,150
...casts such a dark shadow over
20 million hard-working Americans.

192
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,988
At this point in our cultural history,
Mob movies are classic American cinema.

193
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,740
- Like Westerns.
- I have to agree there, Rich.

194
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,578
You never saw the Scotch-Irish
pissing and moaning...

195
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,123
...about being portrayed
as rustlers and gunslingers.

196
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,541
That's absurd!

197
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,127
See what you started
with your gravy, Nana?

198
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,881
To we, the 20 million.

199
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,924
<i>- Salute!
- Salute!</i>

200
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,136
<i>- Cent'anni.
- Salute.</i>

201
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,738
What?

202
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,531
Come here. We're exterminating.

203
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,741
I'm busy now.

204
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,951
Get some <i>sfogliatelle</i> for the guys.

205
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,745
Yeah.

206
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,553
Twenty-nine.

207
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,938
Here you go, big guy.

208
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,157
Hey, Gino. What can I get you?

209
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,410
- Get me some...
- Number 34, right here!

210
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,330
He just went out to get gas in his car.

211
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,751
I go out, fuck your sister, come
back Saturday, I go to the front?

212
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,086
I said he could.

213
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,296
Poppin' Fresh, I'm in no mood!

214
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,216
I'm next, now get a fucking pastry box.

215
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,302
Gino, what can I get you?

216
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,137
Dougie, let him go first.

217
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,223
He don't make the rules here!

218
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,352
All right, two Neapolitan loaves...

219
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,606
You touch a single crust, you'll wish
you took that job at McDonalds!

220
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,899
Fuck you!

221
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,151
Okay, take a walk.

222
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,322
- What about my bread?
- You come back in 10 minutes.

223
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,408
What do you think you're doing?

224
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,034
Come on.

225
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,670
Get up, I'm not gonna hurt you.

226
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,174
What is it?
Do I look like a pussy to you?

227
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,720
- No.
- Seriously, be honest, I won't get mad.

228
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,474
So why give me a hard time
and talk to me like I'm nothing?

229
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,685
I'm sorry.

230
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,021
Get a pastry box.

231
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,315
Move it!

232
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,485
That's better.

233
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,823
Now fill it with <i>cannoli</i>,
<i>sfogliatelle</i> and napoleons.

234
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,330
Move.

235
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,626
Good.

236
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,506
Give me the box. Come on.

237
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,893
Next time you see my face,
show some respect.

238
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,561
I will.

239
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,107
You motherfucker!

240
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,734
You shot my foot!

241
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,571
- It happens.
- You fucking asshole!

242
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:25,498
If I'm getting an invitation to the dance,
I wish the feds would hurry up.

243
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,583
You heard what the news said.

244
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,461
The way things are working,
it's Junior's party.

245
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,589
That was a far-thinking plan
you had there, Tone.

246
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,593
I called you last Christmas.

247
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:38,928
Fuck this!

248
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,931
The <i>sfogliatelle</i>! What's wrong with you?

249
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,601
What are you doing?
You brought up in a barn, or what?

250
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,436
What's the matter with you?

251
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:52,108
This is no time to go on the rag.
Not with the indictment coming down.

252
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,903
Take Georgie, go in the bathroom,
sweep for bugs.

253
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:57,947
Come on.

254
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,124
Well, I hope they'll be all right.

255
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,251
Who?

256
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,795
- The guys.
- What about me?

257
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,965
They didn't even mention your name on TV.

258
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,553
Amazing, huh? That news guy,
he said the words "Brendan Filone"...

259
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:24,515
...the hairs on the back of my neck,
they fucking stood up.

260
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,933
I knew the guy.

261
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,520
They made him look like
John-fucking-Gotti.

262
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,480
I brought him around here.

263
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:36,569
Tony wouldn't have never
known him if it wasn't for me.

264
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,070
I had no idea.

265
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,759
Who is it? I'm sleeping.

266
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,012
- Carmela.
- Oh, come on in.

267
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,807
I just said that in case you were...

268
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:10,352
...that snooty-assed Mrs. Ryan down the hall.

269
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,316
She is so shanty Irish,
and with all her airs.

270
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,778
- Come on, I'm taking you to brunch.
- What?

271
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,614
- Get dressed.
- What's wrong? Tell me.

272
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,325
Why does something have to be wrong?

273
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,368
Meadow? She eats like a bird.

274
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,830
Everything is fine, Ma, relax!
Nothing is wrong.

275
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,835
You come here unannounced.
I shouldn't wonder if something's wrong?

276
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:40,216
Jeez, I'm sorry. It's a nice day,
I thought I would take you out.

277
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,678
I don't want to go out!

278
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,850
Is it Anthony? Those indictments?

279
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,645
His father could take it
in stride, but he can't.

280
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,480
I don't believe you.

281
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,944
Ma, will you get dressed?

282
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:03,239
- We just went to a wedding!
- That was a big to-do.

283
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,492
This way we get to spend
some quality time.

284
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,288
The Manor will stop serving
brunch any minute.

285
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,253
Did he cheat on you again?

286
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,842
I try to do something nice.
I come here to take you out.

287
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:27,805
You think I have some other agenda
that I have to talk to you about?

288
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,974
Don't flatter yourself.

289
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:34,228
I'll... I'll throw something on.

290
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,859
Buckle your seat belt, Ma.

291
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,445
I can't find it! Where is it?

292
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,325
It's not definite.
I just thought I'd tell you.

293
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,203
In case I don't show up
for an appointment.

294
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:19,416
You're telling me you're planning a vacation,
but you're not sure when?

295
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,960
Right.

296
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,922
I may never go.

297
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,717
Let's put it this way:

298
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,180
There's a strong possibility
that it could happen.

299
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:39,770
Does this have anything to do with
what's been on the news lately?

300
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,236
If you suddenly stop coming
to your appointments...

301
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,155
...I will assume that you
are on vacation?

302
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,534
And I should wait to be contacted?

303
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,995
That would be a good assumption.

304
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:06,588
- Who is it?
- Paulie. Open the door.

305
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,234
I thought we were stepping out.

306
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,113
I got two broads in the car.

307
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,949
You said Ade went to stay
at her mother's.

308
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,290
No wonder.
The place looks like a fucking sty.

309
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,127
What's wrong?

310
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,631
Talk to me. This ain't like you, kid.

311
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,636
I ran into Billy Cracciolo.

312
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,764
The meter maid? What about him?

313
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,975
Told me the cops in Nutley
are looking for a guy.

314
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:04,354
Blew off a kid's toe for no good
reason in Russo's Bakery.

315
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:05,814
Drove a Lexus?

316
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,361
Does Tony know about this?

317
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,782
What's going on, Chrissy?

318
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:19,870
Been working my ass off on this script.
You know how many pages I got?

319
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,121
Nineteen.

320
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,291
That a lot or a little?

321
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,295
Books say a movie's supposed
to be about 120 pages.

322
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,798
I thought the computer
would do a lot of it.

323
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,175
You're being frank about the business...

324
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,887
I would never do that.
It's only "suggested by."

325
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:42,184
That writer, with the bullfights?
Blew his own fucking head off.

326
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,937
I bought a scriptwriting program.

327
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,440
My advice? Put that thing down a while.

328
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,150
We get our joints copped.

329
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,445
Tomorrow, the words will come
blowing out your ass.

330
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,200
You ever feel like nothing
good would ever happen?

331
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,994
Yeah. And nothing did. So what?

332
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,871
I'm alive, I'm surviving.

333
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:06,333
That's it. I don't want to just survive.

334
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:11,338
It says in movie-writing books that every
character has an arc, understand?

335
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,469
Everybody starts out somewheres,
and then they do something...

336
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,305
...it changes their life.
That's their arc.

337
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,224
Where's my arc?

338
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,229
All right, take Richard Kimble, right?

339
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:33,068
No, that's no good.
His arc is run, run, jump off the dam...

340
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,323
Keanu Reeves, <i>Devil's Advocate</i>.

341
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,576
- Al.
- Right.

342
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:46,415
Keanu's a lawyer, gets all turned on
by money, power and the devil.

343
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:51,211
Then his wife says, "You're not
the man I married," leaves him.

344
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:52,713
You see the arc?

345
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,760
He starts down here, he ends up here.

346
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,138
Where's my arc, Paulie?

347
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,515
Kid...

348
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:07,769
...Richard Kimble, the <i>Devil's</i> whatever,
those are all make-believe.

349
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,939
I got no arc either.

350
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:16,111
I was born, grew up, spent a few years
in the Army, a few more in the can.

351
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,573
And here I am. A half a wiseguy.
So what?

352
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,075
I got no identity.

353
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,787
Even Brendan Filone's got an identity.
He's dead.

354
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,124
I killed that fucking
Emil Kolar, and nothing.

355
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,168
I don't even move up a notch.

356
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,712
All I got is nightmares.

357
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,798
That Polish, Czech, whatever he is...

358
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,718
...is haunting me in my
dreams every night.

359
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,597
That happens. The more of them
you do, the better you'll sleep.

360
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,516
I had one prick for months in my dreams.

361
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,979
I feel like he's trying to tell me we
fucked up the night we buried him.

362
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,106
- We didn't.
- I'm in danger.

363
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,524
Can I ask a question?

364
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,444
Why would he tell you you're in danger...

365
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,614
...considering you put
a moonroof in his head?

366
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,325
What did we do wrong that night?

367
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,828
The gun was hot, so the slugs
couldn't be traced to me.

368
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,581
You know who had an ark? Noah.

369
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,690
- Is that him?
- That would be some coincidence...

370
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,733
...if it wasn't, wouldn't it?

371
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,197
- Holy shit! Look.
- What?

372
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,200
He was clean-shaven.
He's got a beard now.

373
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,911
You know what?
I read that. That happens.

374
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,080
I always thought it was bullshit.

375
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,124
Look at his fingernails!

376
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,001
They're like a woman's.

377
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,712
I'm gonna fucking puke.

378
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:04,011
Help me lift him and take him to Pine Barrens
before they build a condo here.

379
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,762
Georgie!

380
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,727
I don't know about selling this property.

381
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,230
I don't know about you,
but I sure could use an infusion...

382
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,567
...if we're supporting
Jase after he graduates.

383
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:23,030
It's funny how even during our marriage,
we saw things differently.

384
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,409
I never saw this place as an investment.

385
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,245
I always thought that we'd build a house.

386
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,041
So are we gonna sell, or what?

387
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,376
For Jason.

388
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,589
I don't want to hear that you took
one of your Colleens on a cruise.

389
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,383
What's that supposed to mean, "Colleens"?

390
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,887
We all know you're a sucker
for those Irish girls.

391
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,057
Every Italian boy bows
down to the freckles.

392
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,226
- I married you!
- Yeah, I was a mother figure.

393
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,854
Don't bust my balls
with Freud-by-numbers.

394
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,566
Don't bust my balls?
Richard, your <i>calabrese</i> is showing.

395
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:04,446
Are you implying by all this I'm ashamed
to be an Italian-American?

396
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:07,532
With all the poverty, starvation,
ethnic cleansing...

397
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,785
...and horrible shit in this world...

398
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:14,247
...you devote your energy to protecting
the dignity of Connie Francis!

399
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,836
You're worked up about my patient...

400
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:24,007
...a man who has no bearing on who
or where you are in this world.

401
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,302
Call him a patient.
The man's a criminal, Jennifer.

402
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,056
And after a while, you're gonna
get beyond psychotherapy...

403
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,392
...with its cheesy moral relativism.

404
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,187
Finally, you're gonna get to good and evil.
And he's evil.

405
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,670
Sorry I'm late. The alarm...

406
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,797
What is wrong with you?

407
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,841
I ain't been feeling good.

408
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,760
- I wipe my ass with your feelings.
- Thanks.

409
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,012
Drive the fucking car!

410
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,816
We're under a microscope.
I hear you shot some kid...

411
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,609
...because he made you wait!

412
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,195
- Fucking Paulie!
- Don't blame Paulie!

413
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:31,032
Nutley PD's got a description
and a make on the car!

414
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,368
Why don't you leave a urine sample?

415
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,036
- If I could...
- Shut up!

416
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,832
Georgie comes in with vomit all over.
I ask, "What the fuck?"

417
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,209
He said you're digging up some body!

418
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,003
- I was worried...
- Shut up!

419
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,464
- You want to get caught.
- I want to?

420
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:49,050
Yeah. I seen it before.
That's fucking cowboy-itis.

421
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,719
You want to be a bad guy?

422
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,597
- I was worried that I didn't...
- Shut up!

423
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,272
Can I try and explain here?

424
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,527
I don't know, Tony.

425
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:12,073
It's like the regular-ness of life
is too fucking hard for me.

426
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,201
I don't know.

427
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,708
Look at you.

428
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,712
I'll bet you're sleeping all the time.

429
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,173
It's the only thing I still enjoy.

430
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,302
You know what I think?

431
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:36,056
Maybe I have cancer.

432
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,767
Remember how Jackie got?

433
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,602
Cancer?

434
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:44,856
Something fucking horrible
is going on inside my body.

435
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,276
Does this word "cancer"
pop into your mind a lot...

436
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,820
...a little bit, what?

437
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,784
Well, I'm just thinking, maybe you're...

438
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,537
- ...depressed.
- Me?

439
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,498
I'm no fucking mental midget.

440
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,587
Right.

441
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,217
- Watch the...
- What?

442
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,886
- Filter.
- Oh, fuck!

443
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,149
Maybe you got...

444
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:33,321
...a serotonin problem,
or whatever the fuck they call it.

445
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,615
You know about that shit?

446
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,995
I saw it last night on a program.

447
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,999
What, take fucking Prozac?
Not this skinny <i>guinea</i>.

448
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,129
Let me ask a question.

449
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,508
You ever think about...

450
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,011
...you know...

451
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,556
Fuck no!

452
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,183
Good.

453
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,273
Bunch of losers blowing their
skulls all over the bathroom?

454
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,526
It's fucking pathetic.

455
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,635
- Did you hear the doorbell?
- I'm in the middle of a game.

456
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,929
You'll be in the middle of the street,
you don't wise up.

457
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,318
Anthony Soprano?

458
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,737
Why are you in my yard?

459
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:57,364
The gate was open.

460
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,784
I'm Agent Harris, this is Agent Driscol.
May we come in?

461
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,993
If I say no?

462
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,121
If we were local, we wouldn't knock.

463
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,749
What's your point?

464
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,127
We have a search warrant.
We know you have children.

465
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:16,091
Our other team's out front.
We don't traumatize kids by kicking in doors.

466
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:20,303
So why don't you take a minute
and tell them you have visitors.

467
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,454
Any quarters, you can keep.

468
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,623
You trying to bribe me?

469
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,460
Tell me what you're looking for,
I can save you time.

470
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,463
Any incriminating evidence would be nice.

471
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,217
Dad!

472
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,595
- I have an English paper!
- You gotta be shitting me.

473
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,557
I better have all my programs
when it comes back.

474
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:06,975
Anthony!

475
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,313
What the hell are they
doing in my kitchen?

476
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,402
What are you doing?

477
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,529
Forgot your lunch, just ask.

478
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,989
I'm very sorry.

479
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,575
How much would you say that bowl cost?

480
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,786
- I'm not cleaning that up.
- Grasso, clean that.

481
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,748
<i>Grasso, ti faccio un culo così.</i>

482
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,332
Your ass!

483
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,794
Tony, take it easy.
Grasso, take it easy.

484
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,630
We'll be gone in a few minutes.

485
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,424
Let's wait in the living room.

486
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,885
Clean up the bowl.

487
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,303
Come on.

488
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,439
I know they're doing their job,
but I'm pissed.

489
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,649
Harris wasn't so bad.

490
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,112
He was the biggest sneak out of
all of them. It's part of his act.

491
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,364
That guy broke the bowl on purpose.

492
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,533
He was just a klutz.

493
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:06,951
What was his last name?

494
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,538
- Rizzo, Razzo, what?
- Grasso.

495
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,541
Grasso. You think it's
a coincidence they sent him?

496
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,545
If he wasn't Italian, he'd be
at the office sweeping up. Jerk.

497
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,923
Bet they frisk him before he goes home.

498
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,382
- Why?
- Why?

499
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,761
Because he has a vowel at the end
of his name: Grasso.

500
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:28,181
Does he think he'll make it to the top
by arresting his own people?

501
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,599
Pass the moo sh...

502
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,726
He'll see. He'll learn.

503
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,813
- We have a vowel.
- And you be proud of it!

504
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,942
You'd think there was no Michelangelo,
the way they treat people.

505
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,569
An Italian invented the telephone.

506
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,824
- Alexander Graham Bell was Italian?
- You see? You see what...?

507
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,244
Antonio Meucci invented it,
and he got robbed!

508
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,079
Everybody knows that!

509
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,207
Who invented the Mafia?

510
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,084
What?

511
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,795
- <i>La Cosa Nostra.</i> Who invented that?
- Who cares?

512
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:03,258
Wasn't it Salvatore Lucania,
known as Charlie "Lucky" Luciano...

513
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:08,638
...who organized the five families:
Lucchese, Gambino, Bonanno, Profaci.

514
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,266
Is there something you want to say to me?

515
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,978
I just like history, like you, Dad.

516
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,313
Can you shut the fuck up about it?

517
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,612
A.J., did you know
John Cabot was Italian?

518
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,115
- Whoa.
- Like he knows who that is.

519
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,325
The famous discoverer of Canada.

520
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,077
The Bank of America.

521
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,290
One of the biggest banks in the world,
started by an Italian.

522
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:38,585
The first American saint was Italian.
Mother Cabrini.

523
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,006
Is it true the Chinese
invented spaghetti?

524
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,342
Now think. Why would people
who eat with sticks...

525
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,012
...invent something you
need a fork to eat?

526
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,390
Here's more I bet you don't know.

527
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:56,936
More Italians fought for the U.S. in WWII
than any other ethnic group.

528
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,356
They won't tell you about
Sacco and Vanzetti.

529
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,151
The anti-Christs
that got the electric chair?

530
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,154
- Anarchists.
- Isn't it anti-Christs?

531
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,574
They were innocent and got the chair
because they were Italian.

532
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,535
How are there two anti-Christs
and only one Christ?

533
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,162
So?

534
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,832
And of course, Francis Albert.

535
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,587
Will I see you next week?

536
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,380
If you know something I don't.

537
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:28,176
You understand, I have to charge
you for the missed session.

538
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,803
What do you mean?

539
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,348
We agreed on that on our first meeting.

540
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,642
But I just explained my situation.

541
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,520
I understand, but it's important
that we respect the agreement.

542
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,359
- What if I got hit by a car?
- But you weren't.

543
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,695
- I know, but what if?
- But you weren't.

544
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,572
I know that, but what if?

545
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,241
- You weren't.
- Answer my fucking question!

546
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,702
I will not.

547
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,245
You won't?

548
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,040
All right, fine.

549
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,626
Fine, here. Here you go.

550
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,546
This is what it's all about.
Motherfucking, cocksucking money!

551
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:06,965
Here!

552
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:13,805
I don't understand that, and I don't
appreciate being made to feel afraid.

553
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,558
I don't appreciate feeling like I pour
my heart out to a call girl!

554
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,645
- Is that how you see me?
- Not until now.

555
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,816
But it's obvious you don't give
a shit about my situation.

556
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,318
Otherwise, you wouldn't shake me down.

557
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,032
It'll show as paid on your next bill.

558
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,409
Fine.

559
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,078
Stick it up your ass.

560
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,172
And how about Dr. Goldman here?

561
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:52,760
He was gonna be a tree surgeon,
but he fainted at the sight of sap!

562
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,846
Sap, ladies and gentlemen.

563
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:59,017
Pace yourselves.
Don't spend it all in one place.

564
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:03,312
Movie night, right? Last week they showed
the Polish version of <i>Rashomon</i>.

565
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:06,607
Everybody remembers
the rape exactly the same!

566
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,695
What's the matter with you, Corrado?

567
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,907
Headaches, that's all.
Not the kind you take aspirin for.

568
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:19,412
Now, tonight on our show, we have
Mitzi Gaynor, Sergio Franchi...

569
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:24,000
...and a woman from France will pull
light bulbs from her husband's throat.

570
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,793
This woman can relate.

571
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,628
We may have a bad apple.

572
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,631
Does Tony know about this?

573
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,341
What will you do?

574
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,428
There's not much to do.
We sit back and wait.

575
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:39,849
Don't let Tony know you know.
He's under enough pressure.

576
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,851
Yeah.

577
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:46,397
I'm sure he's telling his psychiatrist
it's all his mother's fault.

578
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,066
What, a psychiatrist?

579
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:51,652
Yeah, a psychiatrist.

580
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,655
He's been seeing one for a while now.

581
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,618
God only knows what he says.

582
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,496
- Tony?
- Yes, Tony.

583
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:05,083
Tony, who had such a terrible mother.

584
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,793
A psychiatrist?

585
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,338
Yes, Junior. For chrissake!

586
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,592
Show of hands, how many people
think J.F.K is still alive? Come on.

587
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:20,014
They should take a Zapruder film
of your salad bar. Hello? Help me out!

588
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,350
Who? The psychiatrist, I mean.

589
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,602
Do you think I know?

590
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,563
- What did you say to Tony about this?
- Me?

591
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,398
Nothing.

592
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,443
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

593
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:37,740
And, Junior, I don't want there
to be any repercussions.

594
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,577
A psychiatrist?

595
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:46,916
You're a broken record. Yes, yes!

596
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,835
Do I have to...?

597
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,258
Do I have to say it again?

598
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,056
Picture yourself at Ellis Island.
All right? How does that sound?

599
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,563
<i>It's me. Leave a message.</i>

600
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,482
<i>Christopher? It's Mommy.</i>

601
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,985
<i>I know you're there. Pick it up.</i>

602
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:17,780
<i>Are you all right?
I'm worried about you.</i>

603
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:22,618
<i>My God, they mentioned your name
in the newspaper.</i> The Star-Ledger.

604
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,914
<i>Mrs. Jones told me.
With all those scumbags!</i>

605
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,418
It's been a while since
we met for therapy.

606
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,840
Jason, how's Bard?

607
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:42,346
I'm moving into a smoke-free dorm.

608
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,934
And how do we feel about that?

609
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,937
I'm interested in discussing
what we mentioned.

610
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:54,025
Jason, are you concerned that your
mother is treating this patient X?

611
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,862
I don't care.

612
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:03,117
As a colleague, Jen, I suggest
you drop the patient.

613
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,994
After her last encounter...

614
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,787
...she finally acknowledged...

615
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,291
...that she saw the different
side of him, the subhuman.

616
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,585
I take it you were frightened.

617
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,421
Frightened, revolted.

618
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,506
At last, appropriate emotions.

619
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,134
Oh, for chrissake, Richard.
You too, Sam.

620
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,387
When did we become afraid
to get our hands dirty?

621
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,181
It's what she gets paid for.

622
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:28,309
Jason, how would you like
to see your mother...?

623
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:34,148
Never mind, I'm not gonna
paint any graphic images.

624
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,151
See? He always does that.

625
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:38,486
What?

626
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,781
Follow that up, Jase. Dad does what?

627
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,825
His issue is that I should distance
myself from this man...

628
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,912
...on the grounds of the stigma
that he brings us.

629
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:51,749
I say refer this patient to a therapist...

630
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:56,045
...that specializes in Mafia depression.

631
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,758
This isn't funny.

632
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,677
No, of course not.

633
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:09,517
Jen has a real honest to goodness
personal and professional dilemma.

634
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:17,191
You know, on my mother's side,
we have a few dark sheep.

635
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:18,734
Excuse me?

636
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:21,737
Lepke.

637
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,077
Who's Lepke?

638
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:31,539
Louis "Lepke" Buchalter.

639
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,709
You know. Murder, Incorporated.

640
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,548
My mother's uncle was Lepke's wheelman.

641
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,341
His driver.

642
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:49,056
Those were some tough Jews.
