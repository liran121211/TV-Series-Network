1
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,413
You gonna say something, or what?

2
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,291
It's your dime.

3
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,255
What's he doing here?

4
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,967
A friend of mine walked by.

5
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,803
Heshie. He has a 3:00.

6
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,910
Yeah, baby.

7
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,847
- What the hell's going on?
- Thunderstorms.

8
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,769
- Jackie.
- You smell it?

9
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,021
That's rain.

10
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,609
Dr. Melfi, what the hell
are you doing to me?

11
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,079
Go back to sleep.

12
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,476
What are you doing up?
You got school tomorrow.

13
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,603
Working on a high score.

14
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,440
- Did your mother go to bed?
- Yeah.

15
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:52,858
Where were you?

16
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,319
The compactor went down
at Barone Sanitation.

17
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,575
Move over.

18
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,830
- Ready?
- Yeah.

19
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,248
Go!

20
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,168
Watch out for the ghosts.

21
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,756
This ain't steering right.

22
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,758
Yeah, kicking your butt.

23
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,677
So how're things going with you?

24
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,055
How's school?

25
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,524
Dad, you have to concentrate.
New game.

26
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,532
- No fair.
- It's called a handicap.

27
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,203
- Come on, stop!
- I'm kicking your ass!

28
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,789
- One hand, look at that!
- I can't see.

29
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,877
Get off!

30
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,213
Stop! Come on!

31
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,635
You lose.

32
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,972
Focus through distractions.
There's your lesson.

33
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,891
I want you in bed in 10 minutes.

34
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,853
Andretti, you listening to me?

35
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,440
Good night, Dad.

36
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,817
Good night.

37
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,072
Where'd you park?

38
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,574
In the parking lot.

39
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,578
- No one followed me.
- Adriana, you wouldn't know it.

40
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,581
Oh, yeah. Like Tony Soprano's
hiding in my back seat.

41
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,085
- You are so paranoid.
- Bring the car right here.

42
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:39,422
I know, he's in disguise.
That could be him.

43
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,260
Hey, Tony! Or maybe
he's in the trash can.

44
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,263
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

45
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,807
Let go of me!

46
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:53,270
It could be anybody, anytime.
I don't even know if it's Tony.

47
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,564
You gave crystal meth to his daughter!

48
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,607
Which I'm not sure he knows.

49
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,651
Look at my wrist. It's all red.

50
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,278
I'm sorry!

51
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,781
But I got dragged out to the fucking
Meadowlands by my neck!

52
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,075
Mock execution!

53
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,536
What?

54
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,872
- What?
- Nothing.

55
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,624
- No, what?
- You don't want to know, trust me.

56
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,459
Know what?

57
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,255
I heard the nurse say you made
number two in your pants.

58
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,631
Is that what happens?

59
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,260
Get the car! Please, can
we just go to Brendan's...

60
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,638
...score some shit and
find out what's going on?

61
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,973
Please!

62
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,981
Brendan, let's go. Wake up, man.

63
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,320
The fool leaves his door open.

64
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,405
- I gotta pee.
- Go for it.

65
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:50,285
Yo, Einstein, you should have seen me
at the hospital. It took three nurses...

66
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,396
Yeah. Yeah.

67
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,399
That's the message. Thanks.

68
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,735
Way to go, Anth!

69
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,989
Hear it in five, four, three, two...

70
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,451
Yo, check it.

71
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,758
- You think this is funny?
- What? What's funny?

72
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,051
I didn't do nothing.

73
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,428
You beep me again, you'll be sorry.

74
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,889
We don't know what you're talking about.

75
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,643
"Your mother blows."
That's a real original message.

76
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,895
- Maybe she does, right?
- Yeah.

77
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,023
Then why'd you eat all the doughnuts
she sent us at camp?

78
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,528
And then cry on her shoulder,
"I'm so homesick, Mrs. Piocosta."

79
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,321
Why don't you shut up?

80
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,408
Have another doughnut,
you fat fart-knocker!

81
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,539
I'm gonna kill him!

82
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,794
Dickwad!

83
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,465
Hey, break it up! Break it up!

84
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,428
I want a 5-minute cool-down period, now.

85
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,353
See you next week, doc.

86
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,857
- Mr. Dante, you forgot something.
- Thank you, baby.

87
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,235
- Don't forget to floss.
- You saved my life.

88
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,779
All right. See you next week, all right?

89
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,618
Can I help you, sir?

90
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,704
Sir?

91
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,581
Sir?

92
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,980
Oh, my God.

93
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,359
- I'm having second thoughts.
- About?

94
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,279
This whole thing, this whole arrangement.

95
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,991
Security.

96
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,953
I come here, I tell you things,
I don't know how safe it is.

97
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,331
I understand your concerns.

98
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,666
But I told you what the ground rules are:

99
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,002
As long as I don't hear
anything incriminating...

100
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,506
You don't fucking get it.
Just my being here incriminates me!

101
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:53,635
Somebody sees me, they tell somebody
else, all of a sudden I'm a celebrity!

102
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,013
I thought we made some
progress on your narcissism.

103
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,725
Who are you?

104
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,479
Why is that so important for you to know?

105
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,858
My mother told me never to answer
a question with a question.

106
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,071
So your mother did teach you something.

107
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:17,492
If I asked you about your life,
who you talk to, who you trust...?

108
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,370
I'd have to take the Fifth.

109
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,082
That's cute.

110
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,507
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware
of what I was saying.

111
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,135
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,229
- Why are you here?
- Chris sent me for you.

113
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,315
Chris? Did something happen?
Must be my dad, right?

114
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,234
Why else would Chris send you?

115
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,528
Did Brendan get my poem?

116
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:58,116
Another search warrant? Calls them
the Federal Bureau of Annoying Bullshit.

117
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,701
You told your old man!

118
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,203
You scared me!
What happened to you?

119
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:06,332
We're moving to Florida because you
couldn't keep your mouth shut!

120
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,876
What are you talking about?

121
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,502
Did Brendan ask about me?

122
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,921
Get us out of here! Get us out!

123
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:17,051
- Did you tell your old man?
- About the meth? Are you insane?

124
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,220
Don't you get it? This is serious!

125
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,431
Let go of me!

126
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,766
Stop this shit!

127
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,187
He's worried about you.
He's been asking about you, asshole.

128
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,982
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

129
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,568
I hate my life, being a Soprano.

130
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:38,281
Hey, don't ever say you hate life.
That's blasphemy.

131
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,033
Fuck you!

132
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,035
Okay, let's go.

133
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,078
Remember when you were little?

134
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,664
I'll buy you one of those
Happy Meals, all right?

135
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,750
Where the fuck are you?

136
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:07,268
This is a new shirt your grandmother bought.
It's in the trash?

137
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,271
It's a Westport.
It's not even cool anymore.

138
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,607
What did you just say?

139
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,484
I got in a fight.

140
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,363
Hope you did as much damage
to his wardrobe. Who with?

141
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,616
I didn't get caught. No demerits.

142
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,494
Anthony, who?

143
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,789
- Jeremy.
- Jeremy Piocosta?

144
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,833
You were together at camp.
I thought you were friends.

145
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,797
If that's all the information
I get, I'll call Mrs. Piocosta.

146
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,674
No, Ma, wait! Don't call!

147
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,677
You kids are gonna learn
the value of a dollar!

148
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,638
- I'll wash your car.
- You never put any effort in.

149
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,140
I will, I promise.
I'll do it really good.

150
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,643
Just don't call, I'll get the money.

151
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,520
Forty dollars, Anthony.

152
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,814
I know, I know.

153
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,948
Ma!

154
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,741
How you doing?

155
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,660
What brings you here?

156
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,788
Remember that pastry place? Ferrara's?

157
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,249
Brought you some macaroons.

158
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,628
They're too sweet!

159
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,589
What do you mean?
They're your favorites!

160
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,264
The activities director, Rosie, says...

161
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,559
...they're organizing a trip to the city.

162
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,477
Dinner and a show.

163
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,605
And you don't want to go.

164
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,693
- I don't like the people here.
- You don't know them.

165
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,487
And that city.

166
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,698
Grown men soiling themselves.

167
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,909
- It's not like that anymore.
- That Giuliani...

168
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,911
Let's stick to the field trip.

169
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,540
Mothers throwing their babies
out of skyscraper windows.

170
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,002
You're always with the babies
out the windows.

171
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:03,259
You don't mix with the other ladies
or talk to the nice gents I see around.

172
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,929
- You're not taking opportunities.
- What do you care?

173
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,682
Out of sight, out of mind.

174
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,018
We don't think like that.

175
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,437
Not me, or Carm, or the kids.

176
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,440
I wish the Lord would take me now.

177
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,364
I came to get cheered up.
Think that's a mistake?

178
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,241
You being sarcastic?

179
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,702
You can't put your problems on me.

180
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,914
This is the most expensive
retirement home in New Jersey.

181
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,249
If you wanted to, you
could be happy here.

182
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,959
You're pissing it all away.

183
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,921
What beautiful language for your mother.

184
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,142
- You want the macaroons?
- I don't care.

185
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,612
Leave some out for the lunatics.

186
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,421
Goodbye, Ma.

187
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:29,178
They're saying it might rain today.

188
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,692
What the hell are you doing?

189
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,403
This place is an hour from my office.

190
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,490
Are you a woman? Get a bladder transplant.
My mother lives here.

191
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,451
It's not real convenient for me.

192
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,455
It's not convenient?
Why don't we meet at your precinct?

193
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,375
The government would love a few
pictures of us for the scrapbook.

194
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,210
What do you got for me?

195
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,381
Here.

196
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,219
- "Jennifer Melfi, M.D."?
- Her background, daily routine.

197
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,722
And your personal
relationship with her is...?

198
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,390
None of your fucking business.

199
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,059
You can't blame a guy for trying.

200
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,728
Are you bored with your life?

201
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,564
Oh, yeah, sure!
Busting whores and junkies.

202
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:26,152
Plus, it's a thrill to pay two alimonies
on a $40,000-a-year income.

203
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,445
All right, listen.

204
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,614
I don't want her touched or bothered.

205
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,408
I want to know the who,
when, why. That's it.

206
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,243
Usual fee?

207
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,580
The Knicks lost, lieutenant.

208
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,832
You're down two large.

209
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,628
- Lay off the vig.
- We'll see what kind of job you do.

210
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,756
Okay. See you in a few days.
What you got in the box?

211
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,674
Macaroons.

212
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,643
This is awful.

213
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,062
I can't deal with this.

214
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,650
What kind of God?

215
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,029
Christopher!

216
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,405
Where you been?

217
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,451
- What happened to you?
- Brendan's dead.

218
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,953
What are you talking about?

219
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,080
The fish is in my pocket.

220
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,582
Brendan's brains are floating
in his bathtub.

221
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,459
Message job. Through the eye.

222
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,794
Moe Greene special.

223
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,630
- Uncle Junior.
- What do you mean, Moe Greene?

224
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,965
In one.

225
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:33,010
Moe's eyes got too big for his stomach,
so they put a caliber in his eye.

226
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,971
Mikey Palmice does their hits.

227
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,432
- In his glasses, you mean.
- Glasses, eyes. Why quibble?

228
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,185
I'm at the World Trade Center.

229
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,401
What are you doing?
Palmice's a made guy.

230
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,861
He didn't have the balls
to do it himself.

231
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,781
Contracted these Russians,
and he killed my friend.

232
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,702
Our response should suit the message.

233
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,122
In the mouth means he was a rat.

234
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:05,167
It's just how Francis framed
the shot, for the shock value.

235
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,795
Brendan didn't deserve it.
Don't talk me out of it.

236
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,797
Listen, you can't touch Mikey.

237
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,718
Your uncle's pissing on your head,
what do you expect me to do?

238
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:18,514
I'm on it, T. I know where Mikey's
house is, over by Route 10.

239
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,352
No. He tries to leave,
you break his other neck.

240
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,180
Hey, Mr. GQ, got a ticket.

241
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,098
How you doing, Mikey?

242
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,434
How you doing?

243
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,398
Son of a...

244
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,569
Your suit's wrinkled.
Here, let me fix it up for you.

245
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,447
Why are you screaming?
Free alterations.

246
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,242
Missed a spot.

247
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,163
This is overdue.

248
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,258
Hear about the Chinese godfather?

249
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,178
He made them an offer
they couldn't understand.

250
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,098
We gonna stop before it gets out of hand?

251
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,643
- Not even a hello?
- I'm here because I love you.

252
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,228
And I respect you.

253
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,605
Don't pretend you're paying me respect.

254
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,941
A son who throws his mother in an asylum.

255
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,901
She lives like a <i>poveretta</i>.

256
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,239
That's none of your business.

257
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,076
Your friends get in my business,
expect me to turn the cheek.

258
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,245
The truck was made good to you.

259
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:09,083
I'm sitting here like patience
on a monument, waiting for discipline.

260
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,794
Your boys were warned,
and still they embarrass me.

261
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,964
I run my crew my way.
What you did was extreme.

262
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,466
Now you're my judge?

263
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,219
I answer to bigger people
than you, my friend.

264
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,471
Like Jackie?

265
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,640
Want to take this to his deathbed?

266
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,730
That nephew of yours
we gave a high colonic...

267
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,648
...he earns good?

268
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,901
- He's coming up.
- Okay.

269
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,154
He works for me now.

270
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,490
Excuse me?

271
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,410
Maybe he gives you <i>agita</i> for a change.

272
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,749
You got some set of balls,
you know that? Absolutely not.

273
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,003
I show you my hand, and you slap it away.

274
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,175
What's the matter with you?

275
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,636
Why can't we talk like
adults anymore, huh?

276
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,513
Out.

277
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,850
Next time you come in,
you come heavy or not at all.

278
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,063
You don't mean that.

279
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,716
By the time I get to take the sergeant
exam, the pay scale is frozen by law.

280
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,010
Why are we following these people?

281
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:46,555
They grabbed a meal, saw a movie.
So what?

282
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,891
Luckily they stopped
at that package store.

283
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,601
I got a juice.

284
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,770
Yeah, I can smell the potatoes.

285
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,231
Hey, listen, asshole.

286
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,568
Same make and model left the scene
of a homicide on Long Island.

287
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,070
Stay fucking current.

288
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,494
You broke it off with the <i>shlub</i>
after a week?

289
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,413
I know. I feel for you males.

290
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,209
It's our goddamned fault
you don't know how to act.

291
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,877
Admitting mistakes.

292
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,757
We tell you to be more sensitive,
you join Promise Keepers.

293
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:27,429
We say, "Get in touch with your feelings."
You run into the woods...

294
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,433
...gunking yourselves with
bear fat, beating a drum.

295
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,394
Don't ruin my evening.

296
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,271
- You know what I mean.
- Sure.

297
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,274
You want someone who's
sensitive to your needs...

298
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,944
...but still decisive enough for
a grope in the closet.

299
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,781
Yeah. Something like that.

300
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,244
Oh, shit! That's all I need.

301
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,289
We were speeding?

302
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,291
I wasn't looking.

303
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,042
Pull over.

304
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,357
License and registration, please.

305
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,906
I'm sorry, officer.
Did I do something wrong?

306
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,326
Detective.

307
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,412
You crossed the double line,
have you been drinking?

308
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,997
We had wine with dinner.

309
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,832
Step out of the car, please.

310
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,876
I don't believe this.

311
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:43,047
Just relax, Randall,
and do what he says, okay?

312
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:50,179
I need you to walk a straight
line to me, sir. Heel to toe.

313
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,014
Look...

314
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,183
I applaud your vigilance.

315
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,518
But this is unnecessary, all right?

316
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,146
I'm a lawyer.
I know I'm under the limit.

317
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,023
- Open the trunk, please.
- Why?

318
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,692
- You want to search my golf...?
- Open it!

319
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,027
I will not!

320
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,237
You ever hear of probable cause?

321
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,990
Oh, yeah, that's a real good legalese!

322
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,076
Are you resisting arrest?

323
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,205
Vin, fucking cool it!

324
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,208
He can't do that!

325
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,086
- Back in the car!
- He didn't do anything wrong!

326
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,463
Back in the car, now!

327
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,757
Come on, let's go!

328
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,387
I perceived what I thought was a weapon.

329
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,722
What the hell's wrong with you, Vin?

330
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,226
Take him. DUI, resisting arrest,
assaulting an officer.

331
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,603
- What's he...?
- Do it!

332
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,397
Jesus Christ!

333
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,610
Don't you touch me!

334
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:51,073
You got prime rib at home.
Don't be going out for hamburgers.

335
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,576
What? What are you talking about?

336
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,203
Randall!

337
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,414
Randall, I'll follow you!

338
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,126
I'm gonna call my lawyer, you fuck, you!

339
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,421
She's seeing a Randall Curtin,
tax lawyer.

340
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,423
He lives at...

341
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,218
...1242 Rennsalaer Road.

342
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,887
He's divorced, got two kids.

343
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,640
He's the country club type.

344
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,393
Not much in the balls
department, I might add.

345
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,728
What about her?

346
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,606
The good doctor, in her office
at 8 a.m., leaves at 6.

347
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,650
Orders a tuna sub and Diet Coke.

348
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:31,280
She's got a three-bedroom condo
in Essex Fells. Shops at Pathmark.

349
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,158
She's divorced, one kid, 19.

350
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,618
Outside of <i>schmucko</i>,
she don't get out much.

351
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,620
But she does see a shrink.

352
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,330
She what?

353
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:45,044
Yeah, she sees a shrink, once a week.
His name is Elliot Kupferburg.

354
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,629
Fuck me!

355
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,799
She don't fuck anyone,
from what I can tell.

356
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,968
It's not because she don't got the goods.

357
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,305
She left her blinds up, I got some
of them Victoria Secret-type snaps.

358
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,307
If you're interested.

359
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,017
A little of this?

360
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,811
- Good enough, then?
- Yeah.

361
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,271
You got any Advil?

362
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,315
What am I, a fucking pharmacy?

363
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:11,320
What you got on Friday's game?
I got three bills on Rutgers.

364
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,655
That'll solve all your problems.

365
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,625
Thank you.

366
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,003
With a stapler?

367
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,215
I heard Mikey had to give up that nice suit.

368
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,176
He got too attached to it.

369
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:39,473
Michael Palmice's been a disease
since he was 5, he had it coming.

370
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,558
It don't make things any easier.

371
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,978
- My uncle's stubborn.
- Stubborn enough to go to war?

372
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,194
What kind of a word is that?

373
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:55,030
There hasn't been a war
since the Columbo thing.

374
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,573
Everybody decided.

375
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,660
No one's going to the mattresses these days.

376
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:03,455
I got a top-of-the-line Posturepedic
at my house. Fuck it.

377
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,918
If Jackie wasn't sick,
this wouldn't have happened.

378
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,378
You're right.

379
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,839
So one of us captains gotta step up.

380
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,966
Lack of control
is fucking up this family.

381
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,176
- That's true.
- You can say that again.

382
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:21,056
If the old man were here,
instead of in that cell in Springfield...

383
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,184
...he'd say, "Raymond,
this is your moment."

384
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,146
Go easy with the grease gun, okay?

385
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:31,942
You're the Boy Wonder. Him and Jackie
both had you picked from day one.

386
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,236
You got the age, the seniority.

387
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,573
I also got an 18-year-old with MS, okay?

388
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,242
I told Nucci I'd be doing less, not more.

389
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:44,580
All due respect to your crippled kid,
you don't want a wire up your ass.

390
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,791
That's why you should be boss,
you're so fucking smart.

391
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,253
And it's "physically challenged."

392
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,671
Absolutely.

393
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,758
Why don't we run it like a council?

394
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,597
Larry, the old guys set this up
as a paramilitary organization.

395
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,434
We need a supreme commander,
not the fucking Dave Clark Five.

396
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,981
Face it, T. You and Junior are
gonna have to duke it out.

397
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,774
You've gotta be boss.

398
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,943
Number one, I love the man.

399
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:18,030
Number two, he's got New York behind him.

400
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,699
Not for anything, God bless your uncle...

401
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:24,119
...but he's living in the wrong century.
New York knows it.

402
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,082
You want it, T, you'll get there okay.

403
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,169
It's the right thing. It's inevitable.

404
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,088
I don't want no disturbance.

405
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,563
Hey, what's up?

406
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,398
Nothing.

407
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,652
Bet you told your mom what happened.

408
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,278
What are you, high?

409
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,325
Well, you owe me $40 for the shirt.
The collar was ripped.

410
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,535
You still owe me for 4th of July.

411
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,454
Bottle rockets? I paid for them.

412
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,541
Not for the M-80s. Remember,
the ones we blew up the frogs with?

413
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,002
Oh, yeah. That was pretty cool.

414
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,587
Yeah.

415
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,090
Just give me the money.

416
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,634
That thing was gay!
I did you a favor.

417
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,177
You're gonna do it!

418
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,346
Make me, fatty!

419
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,266
- Dickwad!
- Asshole!

420
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,022
Shithead!

421
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,192
Bitch! Come on.

422
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,153
Let's go, shithead!

423
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,156
- Let me go!
- So I can kick your ass again?

424
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,201
- I was kicking your ass!
- Nobody won, it was a draw.

425
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,038
The Pit, tomorrow, 3:00.

426
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,459
Help me with the chinch bugs,
they're killing my corn.

427
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,171
This stuff works pretty well.
It's safe for the environment.

428
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,798
I tried that.

429
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,426
You got any DDT back there?

430
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,428
That stuff's illegal, it's been banned.

431
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,681
Maybe you have a little
surplus back there.

432
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,224
I'll meet you back there.

433
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,101
If I could help, I would...

434
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:15,188
Mr. Piocosta! Right?
How you doing?

435
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,236
You remember, our boys went
to Camp Aheka together?

436
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,322
- Of course, Tony. How are you?
- Good.

437
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,116
Your kid still got that killer
crossover dribble?

438
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,868
Yeah, I guess so.

439
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,578
That'll get him a scholarship.

440
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,038
So how's Anthony?

441
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:35,125
He's moody, you know.
For a kid that age, you know.

442
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,836
Nice seeing you, Tony.

443
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,089
Why don't we get together
and cook dogs for the boys?

444
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:46,511
Tony, I don't even know if these
guys are close anymore.

445
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,513
Did Anthony say anything?

446
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,932
I'll have Carmela call Joanie.

447
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,769
- Linda.
- Linda.

448
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:58,440
That's great. Tony, that's great.
I'll see you around.

449
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,311
- Tony!
- Yeah?

450
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,439
Oh, my God! Tony!

451
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:47,739
I thought the medication was supposed
to help your panic attacks.

452
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,203
It does. It's the first one in a while.

453
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:57,958
What does your therapist say?
He should increase your dosage.

454
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:03,338
He's got more degrees than a thermometer.
Don't worry about it.

455
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,386
Does your therapist ask questions
about our marriage?

456
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,889
I know personal feelings are
hard for you to talk about.

457
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,225
That's all we do is talk.

458
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,604
Carm, I'm gonna quit.

459
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:25,235
- Did you bring this up with him?
- Yeah. He knows.

460
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,320
I guess.

461
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,618
I forgot to take my Prozac this morning.

462
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,580
It's up in the bathroom, can you get it?

463
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:42,919
I know with Jackie sick, you're
under tremendous pressure.

464
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:47,549
But I feel if the therapy didn't
hurt, it wouldn't be helping!

465
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,220
- You don't understand.
- That's why you're in therapy.

466
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,639
Because I don't understand!

467
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:59,227
I'm telling you, if you give up now,
I'll have to re-evaluate things.

468
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,646
What is that, huh?

469
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:05,442
I got a sensitive job, I'm not
an average Joe on the block.

470
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,277
It's our marriage, Tony!

471
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,613
Therapy is too much exposure!

472
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,699
Fine! You live with the results then.

473
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,744
What's that, a threat?

474
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:20,790
No, Tony, it's a rave review.
Get your own fucking pills.

475
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,423
How long did the attack last?

476
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,926
About 30 seconds.

477
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,306
I was dizzy, out of breath.
That's it, I never lost consciousness.

478
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,807
Anything since?

479
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,981
I'll write you a scrip for Xanax,
just for a couple of days.

480
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:48,652
It'll get you over
the short-term stresses.

481
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:55,617
My uncle's got me in a box where I gotta
do something I don't want to do.

482
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,624
Then there's my mother.

483
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:07,295
Four grand a month and she acts like I'm
an Eskimo, pushing her out to sea.

484
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,635
She's testing.

485
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,846
Same as your uncle.

486
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,016
Like little kids.

487
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,186
There's a good book about this.

488
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,564
No, I read, I go right out.

489
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:29,776
It's <i>Strategies for Coping
with Elder Family.</i>

490
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,822
You can't fucking spank them.

491
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:38,076
Would it hurt to let your mother
think she's still in charge?

492
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,079
You have children,
you know what they're like.

493
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:46,459
Sometimes it's important to let them
have the illusion of being in control.

494
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,931
Chris, my man!

495
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,391
Surprised to see me?

496
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,936
Heard they took you for a ride.
Tour of the Meadowlands.

497
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,607
Heard you had a little b.m.

498
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,401
- You got my cut?
- They came and took it.

499
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,070
- Who?
- Junior Soprano's boys.

500
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,573
They said it's their corner now.

501
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,033
You let them?

502
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,702
I don't argue well sucking
on a Smith & Wesson.

503
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,204
- You didn't beep me?
- Word on the street...

504
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,958
...you out of commission.
Sorry, man, business.

505
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,214
You know, there's no one I'd rather
give my 10 points to than you.

506
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,218
It's all right. It's not your fault.

507
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,679
I'm glad to hear you say that, man.

508
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,224
Sneaky motherfucker.

509
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,393
Shit!

510
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,400
I don't care if they shove
a scud missile up your ass.

511
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:56,905
It's my corner. Pay anyone but me,
I'm coming back for your thumbs!

512
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,991
And that didn't happen, what you said!

513
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,582
I'm gonna kill you!

514
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,589
Good luck, A.J.

515
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,634
if you get in trouble,
go for the takedown.

516
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,221
Sweep kick and steamroll,
the game is over.

517
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,264
All you're doing is making me nervous.

518
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:26,434
- Want a Nitro bar?
- Would you shut the fuck up?

519
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,022
- He's coming!
- It's the moment of truth.

520
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:05,640
Here.

521
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,350
What the hell is that?

522
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,394
Just take it.

523
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,855
I'll fight you for it.

524
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,648
I can't!

525
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,943
- What do you mean, can't?
- Just take it!

526
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,450
I knew you'd chicken out.

527
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,999
He chickened out, he's scared.

528
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,168
He's real scared of you.

529
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,253
What's that supposed to mean?

530
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,797
You won, man!
Yeah, Tonio, you won!

531
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,257
I'm leaving.

532
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,382
<i>One of gangland's youngest
alleged leaders...</i>

533
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,719
<i>...died late this afternoon
at St. Isaac's Hospital.</i>

534
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,930
Turn it off! Turn the music off!

535
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,224
<i>...One of the state's top Mafia figures...</i>

536
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,768
<i>...was first hospitalized last year.</i>

537
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:37,232
<i>Authorities called Aprile the acting boss
for 74-year-old "Eckley" DeMeo...</i>

538
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:41,236
<i>...currently serving a life sentence
in Springfield Penitentiary.</i>

539
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,321
<i>Authorities say he was
made acting boss...</i>

540
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:46,282
<i>...for the North Jersey
Mafia two years ago.</i>

541
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,910
<i>Aprile was 44 years old.</i>

542
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,959
Damn it, I was just there.
He told me he wouldn't go today.

543
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,548
I'll never forget where I was this day.

544
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:10,223
- Sorry, T.
- He was a good man.

545
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,396
Let's do a toast, give me a toast.

546
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,943
To a great man. To a great leader.

547
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,445
A great friend.

548
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,366
To Jackie.

549
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,661
<i>Buon'anima.</i>

550
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,755
- You hear what happened?
- Just now.

551
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:47,218
That's not all! I go to make
a pickup from Yo Yo Mendez...

552
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,013
...he says it ain't my corner
anymore. It's Junior's.

553
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,015
Christopher, this ain't the time.

554
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,558
They're moving in!

555
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,603
I say we go to Def Con 4.

556
00:39:58,438 --> 00:39:59,981
I gotta assess this, all right?

557
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,900
What are we, politicians?

558
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,110
Does this look like the Senate?

559
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,362
This is about respect of our thing!

560
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,489
Shut the fuck up!
It doesn't concern you!

561
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:13,244
I represent you, and I'm tired of
putting my tail between my legs!

562
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,371
This ain't negotiation time!

563
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:19,167
This is <i>Scarface</i>, final scene,
fucking bazookas under each arm.

564
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,044
"Say hello to my little friend!"

565
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,171
Always with the scenarios.

566
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:27,091
You don't do something,
I gotta question your leadership!

567
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,844
You ungrateful little fuck!

568
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,805
Where'd you get the balls
to question my leadership?

569
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,724
I'm just saying how it is!

570
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,936
I'll rip your fucking head off
and finish the job!

571
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,938
- You're the boss!
- That's right...

572
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:44,025
...I am. And you're lucky
a man I loved died today.

573
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,790
Here we go, war of '99.

574
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,124
We should go.

575
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,211
You do what you're told,
when you're told!

576
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,214
<i>Adiós</i>, Junior.

577
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,244
Uncle Junior...

578
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,830
...I need to talk to you.

579
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:46,421
I came in heavy, like you said,
but I don't want to use it.

580
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,190
Our friend Jackie has died.

581
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:09,694
I heard.

582
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,030
And we need a leader.

583
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,450
We do.

584
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:22,623
I don't want any confusion
or misunderstanding.

585
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,250
Yes.

586
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,922
Sopranos have been waiting
a long time to take the reins.

587
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,431
That's why I want it
to be you, Uncle Jun.

588
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,814
This is your decision?

589
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,483
It is.

590
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,651
You speak for the captains?

591
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,071
I can.

592
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,157
Come here.

593
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,452
You crazy <i>cetriolo</i>.

594
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,329
You had me worried there.

595
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,040
You think I'm gonna mess
with a guy like you?

596
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,834
You been pumping iron?
Strong as a bull.

597
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,796
Call Parcells, give this guy a tryout.

598
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,632
- Come here.
- Always the bullshitter.

599
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,051
Just one thing, one thing.

600
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,387
You know I can't be perceived
to lose face, right?

601
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,015
So...

602
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,644
...Bloomfield...

603
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,022
...and the Paving Union.

604
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,274
That's my asking price.

605
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,282
Congratulations.

606
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,412
You know the rules.

607
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,919
I almost got in a fight today.

608
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,420
Fight?

609
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,631
With Jeremy Piocosta.

610
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,050
I take French with his brother,
he's such a poser.

611
00:43:56,217 --> 00:44:00,304
- Who won?
- No one. He backed out.

612
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,224
Phil Litto said, "Yeah,
he's real scared of you."

613
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:06,018
When I asked what that
meant, they all laughed.

614
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,229
What do you mean?

615
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,399
Sometimes you're so naive.

616
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,693
What does Dad do for a living?

617
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,444
Waste management.

618
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,364
Do you know any other garbage
men who live like this?

619
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:19,866
Uncle Jackie.

620
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:23,077
Why do we call him "uncle"
when he's not related?

621
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,998
He's in Dad's other family.

622
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,085
Come here.

623
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,848
I'll print it out for you.

624
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:26,682
Hi!

625
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,726
Jennifer.

626
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,603
I tried calling.

627
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,482
Yeah, the phone's off the hook.
Come on in.

628
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,491
I guess we won't be going to dinner.

629
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,993
I'm worried, Jennifer.

630
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:52,083
I think I'm starting to lose it.

631
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:55,294
I was standing in line
in the doughnut shop.

632
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,171
A man in a booth looked at me.

633
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,633
All of a sudden, I started
shaking uncontrollably.

634
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,219
The lady says "next," I ran away.

635
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,556
Hey...

636
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,561
You've been through a very
traumatic experience.

637
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,274
I hate to admit this...

638
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,819
...but I'm afraid to go outside.

639
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,993
I got this crazy idea
that I'm being followed.

640
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,080
And this song keeps
running through my head.

641
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:34,250
"People are Strange," The Doors.

642
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:39,630
Where, "faces look evil
when you're alienated."

643
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,090
Randall...

644
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,261
Dead at 27 in a Paris bathtub.

645
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,597
I think you should go
and talk to Mel Gelbar.

646
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:52,184
He specializes in post-traumatic
stress disorder.

647
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,396
You couldn't prescribe something?

648
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,857
I'm your date, not your doctor.

649
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:01,610
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. No.

650
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,895
Saw my first dead body
when I was about 15.

651
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:37,772
Maybe 16.

652
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,776
I won't tell you about how he
got clipped because it was...

653
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,614
Sorry.

654
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,699
You okay?

655
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,118
I was thinking...

656
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:55,498
I guess I live a sheltered existence.

657
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,166
How so?

658
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,713
I'm in this room for 10 hours a day.

659
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:08,761
I guess I'm out of touch with the climate
of rage in American society...

660
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,724
...the casual violence.

661
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,144
Your voice is all tight.

662
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:25,611
This week my, my friend got beat up...

663
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,280
...by a policeman, no less.

664
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,826
Oh, yeah?

665
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,412
It was a nightmare.

666
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:44,422
I mean, I don't know if this cop
was crazy or drunk or what.

667
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:49,802
But he was raving, "prime rib,
hamburger," it was surreal.

668
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,847
Fucking moron.

669
00:48:55,182 --> 00:49:00,104
I mean, it sounds like this
guy is a fucking moron.

670
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:03,441
My friend's filing suit against the city.

671
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:07,611
The worst part of it is,
our relationship will never be the same.

672
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,321
Sorry.

673
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,615
Oh, it wasn't your fault!

674
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,911
Hey, this is your session.

675
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,330
I'm sorry, this is...

676
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,374
...very unprofessional.

677
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,836
It's all right, you had your
wits scared out of you.

678
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:26,630
Is the Xanax helping?

679
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,009
It's fine, no more attacks.

680
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,805
But you still have your doubts?

681
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,768
About therapy? No, no, no, no.

682
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,981
Giving it another chance.
Get a lot of good ideas here.

683
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,984
Okay.

684
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,986
On how to cope.

685
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:58,287
Tell me why this was a smart move,
to make Junior the Big Willie.

686
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:02,791
Look at him. He's content.
Thinks he's the king of kings.

687
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,588
Truth is, every decision is made by me.

688
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,840
I still worry about the money end.

689
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,384
That's what you do, you worry.

690
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,429
He doesn't know what
we kick back to Jackie.

691
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,182
We're gonna do good.

692
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:23,229
The point is, he's got the title.
He's a happy fucking camper.

693
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,189
The house is secure.

694
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:29,443
Now we got a brand-new lightning
rod on top to take the hits.

695
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,612
Smart. Very smart.

696
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,241
Yeah, and now you got
Bloomfield and the union chair.

697
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:39,328
Otherwise you'd fuck me, but you
wouldn't respect me in the morning.

698
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:42,790
As long as you guarantee
to keep the old fart in line.

699
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,252
I still love that man.
I'm his favorite nephew.

700
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,046
Look at him, over there with my ma.

701
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,924
Those people went through World War ll.

702
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:23,664
T, check out the government.

703
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,587
Shooting right to left.

704
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,922
They got Uncle Jun's good side.
