1
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:08,759
<i>John Gotti, life in prison...</i>

2
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,886
<i>...no chance of parole.</i>

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:17,768
<i>We've seen prosecutions in Florida
and elsewhere of top Mob figures.</i>

4
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,020
What are you doing?
Put that back.

5
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:27,027
<i>What's the situation on the ground
today, right now, in the Mob?</i>

6
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,990
<i>Confusion, instability,
vacuum at the top.</i>

7
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,618
- <i>What caused the decline?</i>
- Your sister's ass.

8
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,579
<i>An aggressive government
policy over two decades...</i>

9
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,456
<i>...to behead the crime families.</i>

10
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,709
<i>But wasn't it, at least in part...</i>

11
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,795
<i>...a disregard within the Mob itself...</i>

12
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,217
<i>...of the rules that served
the old dons so well?</i>

13
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,344
- If the shoe fits.
- <i>No doubt.</i>

14
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,138
Sil. Cheer me up, babe.

15
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,352
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

16
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,606
Is that Pacino or is that Pacino?
Spitting image.

17
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,942
<i>- Vincent Rizzo.
- Yes.</i>

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,736
<i>Former soldier in the Genovese family.</i>

19
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,823
<i>Government witness turned
best-selling author.</i>

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,158
<i>Do you agree with U.S. Attorney Braun?</i>

21
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,952
<i>The party's over.</i>

22
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,706
<i>- He is a wiseguy. Elaborate.
- It's not like it was.</i>

23
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,458
- Cloning.
- Mexicans are huge in that.

24
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,628
- Fascinating.
- Because they work as parking valets.

25
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,423
<i>Do I mean that organized crime...</i>

26
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,844
<i>...will go the way of the dodo bird?</i>

27
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,890
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Mexicans.

28
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,851
- What about them?
- Cell phones.

29
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,478
I'm not talking about
cloning cell phones.

30
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,815
I'm talking about fucking sheep!
Science.

31
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,318
I tell my kids,
"Only God can make a life."

32
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,488
A guy here asks, "What if
they had cloned Princess Di?"

33
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,200
<i>But you know, the heydey?
You know, the Golden Age...</i>

34
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,202
<i>...or whatever, of the Mob?</i>

35
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,495
<i>That's gone.</i>

36
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,831
<i>And that's never coming back.</i>

37
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,376
<i>They have only themselves to blame.</i>

38
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,421
They pay this <i>chiacchierone</i> by the word?

39
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,048
<i>Drug trafficking.</i>

40
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,884
<i>I think it ruined everything.</i>

41
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,220
<i>You're looking at a mandatory
35 to life in prison.</i>

42
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,807
<i>Guys started to rat so they
could avoid prosecution.</i>

43
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,352
What's going on with that Princess Di?

44
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,938
Do you think the royal
family had her whacked?

45
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,733
Last time I take a limo in Paris.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,943
Like you were ever in Paris.

47
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,612
I went for a blowjob.

48
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,824
Your mother was working the bonbon
concession at the Eiffel Tower.

49
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:41,203
You hear what I told him?
"I went over for a blowjob.

50
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,040
Your mother was working
at the Eiffel Tower."

51
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,584
I got a list of people
I wouldn't want cloned.

52
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,296
The mayor of New York, that's
the guy least likely to get cloned.

53
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:56,259
<i>So the code of silence, the </i>omertà<i>,
or whatever, just went by the boards.</i>

54
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,430
<i>You're always gonna have
organized crime. Always.</i>

55
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,141
<i>As long as the human being
has certain appetites...</i>

56
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,603
<i>...for gambling, pornography or whatever...</i>

57
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,024
<i>...someone's always gonna surface
to serve these needs. Always.</i>

58
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:15,487
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

59
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,685
- You got DVD players?
- Don't hurt me.

60
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,480
Only people who get hurt
are the jerk-offs.

61
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,066
Now step down, nice and easy.

62
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,944
He's got the DVD players.

63
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,154
Quick and painless.
Don't wanna hurt you.

64
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,240
You gotta tie me up.

65
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,159
- You gonna be a jerk-off?
- My boss'll think I'm in on it.

66
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,454
We look like we want a merit badge?
We travel with rope?

67
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,624
I've got some in the cab.
Please, I need this job.

68
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,292
Okay, get the rope.

69
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,713
I don't know who gave the route,
but there's no way I'd go unscathed...

70
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,258
- ...without being fired.
- You want to be scathed?

71
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,427
So it looks like I didn't
give up without a struggle.

72
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,309
That's cool. Thank you.

73
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,437
That's enough.

74
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,606
No, wait.

75
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,902
That's good!

76
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,153
- Scathed?
- Scathed.

77
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,322
He's scathed.

78
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,288
Mr. Miller, my science teacher,
he got his car stolen.

79
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,915
You're kidding.
From where? His house?

80
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,626
His parking spot at school.

81
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,462
A Saturn. He only had it a year.

82
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,506
The security people are a joke.

83
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:26,011
Did you hear what A.J. just said?
Mr. Miller's car got stolen.

84
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,054
Refresh my memory. Who is he?

85
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,849
He's your son's science teacher.

86
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,604
You're up early.

87
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,981
He just bought that car a year ago.

88
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,691
So? Insurance will pay.

89
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,693
They don't give full value.

90
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,195
These poor teachers,
they don't make a lot.

91
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,823
So he can work his summer vacation.

92
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,200
You could help find it.

93
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,455
I thought I told you I changed
my name from LoJack to Soprano.

94
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,457
Laugh. I'd pee in my pants.

95
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,209
Pussy's got the body shop.
He couldn't ask?

96
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,420
I'm late.

97
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,298
- What are you getting in science?
- D-plus.

98
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,219
- See what I can do.
- That's not what I meant.

99
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,014
He's gotta work for his grades.

100
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,525
I'm going back to bed.

101
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,486
- Bye, Dad.
- See you later.

102
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,950
Here, eat this.

103
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,417
Technology comes to the Bing!

104
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,628
Hey, where you been?

105
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,839
- Come on.
- Let's go.

106
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,093
- Hey, is the load here?
- Yeah.

107
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,430
If Serge calls, I'll be back.

108
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,559
These new phones, hold, conference,
sometimes I get confused.

109
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,063
How complicated is it?
Answer the phone, take the message.

110
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,774
Voice mail only comes on
if you let it ring.

111
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,026
Jesus Christ, Georgie.

112
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,579
I hear there's not as many
titles as on laser.

113
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:17,872
There's more coming.

114
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,875
My internist said the picture's
not that different.

115
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,461
But the sound, way improved.

116
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,550
Good. Nothing beats popping up some
corn and listening to <i>Men in Black</i>.

117
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,261
- Fuck it!
- It's the damn wires, that's all!

118
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,305
I'll hook it up.
I used to be an installer.

119
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,438
Why can't you be nice to Brendan?

120
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,648
We discussed that.

121
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,279
I was gonna come looking.
It's the guy.

122
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,905
It's Serge?

123
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,657
I'll take it over there.

124
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,124
Serge?

125
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,337
Press "hold" when you transfer a call.

126
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,797
I'm sorry, Tony.

127
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,012
Now he's not gonna call back.

128
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,640
Brendan's a good earner, T.
This jack was his plan.

129
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,268
He's a good kid, but I don't like meth.

130
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,191
Fuck, I gotta call my mother.

131
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,824
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Ma?</i>

132
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,161
Oh, look who calls.

133
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,706
- <i>How you doing?</i>
- I was wondering when you'd call.

134
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,085
You can stop wondering now.
This is it, I'm calling you.

135
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,255
I called yesterday.
You were supposed to call me back.

136
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,008
I phoned your house.

137
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:56,012
Some operator answered. I couldn't
understand a word she was saying.

138
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,516
That's not an operator,
that's an answering machine.

139
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,602
Oh, fancy, fancy.

140
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:06,022
Here, let me turn the heat off
under these mushrooms.

141
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,613
You and Mom are like peas in a pod.

142
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,659
She can't master the phone, but she's 70.
What's your excuse?

143
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,252
What is she doing now?

144
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,302
Oh, my God.

145
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,431
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- Ma!

146
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,434
<i>Ma!</i>

147
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,189
<i>Hey, Ma!</i>

148
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,445
- Oh, my God!
- <i>Ma!</i>

149
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,780
Where is she?

150
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,491
- Who is this?
- <i>It's Anthony!</i>

151
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,161
The mushrooms, they're on fire!

152
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,913
Get the fire extinguisher under the sink!

153
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,417
Oh, my God!
The wall's getting all black!

154
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,419
Ma, hang up and call 911.

155
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,421
The guy's on the second line.

156
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,924
- <i>Aren't you coming over?</i>
- You press "hold," goddamn it.

157
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,260
I can't, I'm 40 minutes away.

158
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,221
You hang up and you call 911.
Leave the house.

159
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,266
Look at how I live!

160
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,686
Ma, hang up and call 911.

161
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,112
- <i>Hello?</i>
- My mother's got a fire in the kitchen.

162
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,199
- Oh, my God.
- <i>She's calling 911. Get over there.</i>

163
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,493
- I'm on my way.
- Thank you, baby. I know you're busy.

164
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,705
Serge, Serge.

165
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,332
I can't talk now.

166
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,460
I gotta go to an outside line.
Give me your number.

167
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,255
All right. I'll call you back.

168
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,216
Is your mom okay?

169
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,301
Shit cannot go on like this.

170
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,930
Hey, T. Hey, T.

171
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,516
This teacher, his car,
you got a plate number?

172
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,436
Call my wife.

173
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,360
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

174
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,819
No problem.

175
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:30,333
Ma, I wish you'd let me get
somebody to help you.

176
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,420
- You shouldn't be alone.
- Help me what?

177
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,174
- With the housework.
- I have my ways.

178
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,178
A stranger could care less
about doing it right.

179
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,183
Can I tell you something though, Ma?
You need company.

180
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,853
Don't start with that nursing-home
business again.

181
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,649
This is not a nursing home.
It is a retirement community.

182
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,867
You want me to make you <i>pastina</i>?
Something in your stomach?

183
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,874
Ma, now, I've told Tony...

184
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,586
...and I've told you many times.

185
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,506
You can come live with us.

186
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,551
I know when I'm not wanted!

187
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:28,057
I invited you to share my home.
If you want me to beg, that's different.

188
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:34,731
Leave this place that my
husband and I shared?

189
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,109
Well, change can be a positive.

190
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,737
He was a saint.

191
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:49,287
That son of mine,
is he still having those fits?

192
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,042
They're not fits, Ma.
They're anxiety attacks.

193
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,794
You know, he's on medication.

194
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,179
What BMW's charging us for paint?

195
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,933
- It's been that way for six months.
- When was I last here?

196
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,936
Hey.

197
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,607
We maybe caught a break.

198
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,693
Watchung Avenue said some
guys brought a Saturn...

199
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,820
...trying to load it for parts.

200
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,491
Are you saying this car's for Tony
and leave it all in one piece?

201
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,744
Yeah, sure.
It's for the kid's teacher.

202
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,500
My guy said one of those goofballs
had a uniform on from Buttfucks.

203
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,504
Whatever, the coffee shop.
I guess the guy works there.

204
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,005
Watchung and what?

205
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,469
I'm fucking Rockford here.

206
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,936
Decaf cappuccino Primo, non-fat
Magnifico, double espresso regulare.

207
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,312
I'll take you here.

208
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:02,985
I think I'll have an espresso.
Paul, you want anything?

209
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,737
They got any just coffee?

210
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,365
Our café du jour is New Zealand Peaberry.

211
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,328
- Whatever.
- That's $4.20. Pick it up there.

212
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,289
One medium du jour, one single espresso.

213
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,791
Here, keep it.

214
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,627
Honey, let me ask you.

215
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:23,464
My wife was in the body shop around
the corner the other day.

216
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:28,136
The guy in front of her leaves
and she sees he dropped...

217
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,846
...his money clip.

218
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,349
But he was already gone.
We'd like to give it back.

219
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,186
She said he was wearing
a uniform like that there.

220
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,273
Real black hair.
Tall? Little earring.

221
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,358
These stores are everywhere.

222
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,694
Yeah, tell me about it.

223
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,743
Fucking Italian people.
How'd we miss out on this?

224
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,414
- What?
- Fucking espresso, cappuccino.

225
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,917
We invent it and these
cocksuckers are getting rich.

226
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,419
Isn't it amazing?

227
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,921
It's not just money.
It's a pride thing.

228
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,384
All our food, pizza, calzone,
buffalo mozzarella...

229
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,552
...olive oil.

230
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,554
These fucks had nothing.

231
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,724
They ate <i>puzzi</i> before
we gave them our cuisine.

232
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,895
But this, this is the worst.
This espresso shit.

233
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,062
Take it easy.

234
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,359
She finally agreed to have
somebody come in days.

235
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:30,740
Carmela called an agency, and they
sent over this Trinidadian woman.

236
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,453
But no matter what I do, I feel guilty.

237
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,746
Why?

238
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,336
The real reason is,
I can't let her live with us.

239
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,923
That doesn't seem practical,
given her personality.

240
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,719
Well, it's my wife.
She won't allow it.

241
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,013
Where are your sisters in this?

242
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,559
They cut it off with her long ago.
No way she's bunking with them.

243
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:03,189
So you're carrying all this guilt when
your mother is clearly someone...

244
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,776
...who has difficulty
maintaining any relationship.

245
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,030
But she's my mother.

246
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:15,368
You're supposed to take care of
your mother. She's a little old lady.

247
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,161
Not to you.

248
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,955
She's very powerful.

249
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,414
Bullshit.

250
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,125
You accord this "little old lady"...

251
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,379
...an almost mystical
ability to wreak havoc.

252
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:30,216
Let me tell you. You definitely
don't want to get her started.

253
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:35,429
There are some people who are not
ideal candidates for parenthood.

254
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,808
Come on. She's an old sweetie-pie.

255
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,646
What were some of the good
experiences you remember as a child?

256
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,606
The loving warm ones?

257
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,288
One time we were down at the shore.

258
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,791
About '68, '69, the whole family.

259
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,005
My father, he tripped and fell down
the stairs, and we were all laughing.

260
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:13,009
The whole family was laughing.
My mother was laughing.

261
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,179
Any other loving experiences?

262
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,682
Hey, she's a good woman.

263
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,476
She put food on the table every night.

264
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,273
I'm the ungrateful fuck.
I come here, complain about her...

265
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,818
...and I let my wife exclude
her from my home.

266
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,417
Hey, Ma!

267
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,922
- You Perrilyn?
- Yes.

268
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,799
Tony Soprano.

269
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,553
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

270
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:04,477
Oh, Livia, your son is here!
And isn't he a handsome thing.

271
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,563
And look what he brought.

272
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,402
All right, listen.
Let's get one thing straight.

273
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:18,616
In the hours you're here taking care
of my mother, no ganja. Okay?

274
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:22,119
Hey, Ma, <i>fiori</i>.

275
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:27,333
I'm not dead, unfortunately for some.

276
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,960
The tall ones are delphiniums.

277
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,047
You know, Frankie Valli
when he visits Jersey?

278
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,466
This is the florist he uses.

279
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,510
Aren't they beautiful?

280
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,929
Want me to put them on the table?

281
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,891
You make sure the bottom
of the vase isn't wet.

282
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,061
Mr. Tony, would you like
some tea or something?

283
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,522
Coke, thanks.

284
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,154
So how's it going today?

285
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,282
She's stealing.

286
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,284
Who?

287
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,620
That <i>ditsoon</i>, who.

288
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:11,210
That beautiful plate Aunt Settimia took
from that restaurant in Rome. It's gone.

289
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,381
I don't know.
She seems like a nice person.

290
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,134
She doesn't fool me for a second.

291
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,224
You sure she stole it?

292
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,270
You didn't give it to one
of the relatives?

293
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:33,858
You keep forcing your possessions
on people, thinking you're gonna die.

294
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,026
I wish it was tomorrow.

295
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,991
And she's so forward too.
Who does she think she is?

296
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,453
She's happy, Ma. She's singing.

297
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,080
Anthony, I don't want her around here.

298
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,499
I can manage somehow.

299
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,169
No, I'm not giving in to you this time.

300
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,337
She stays.

301
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,638
Your uncle called here looking for you.

302
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,223
Uncle Jun?

303
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,350
He sounded agitated.

304
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,857
Jackie, tell them to leave
Comley trucking alone.

305
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,818
Didn't know it was a Comley truck.

306
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:22,573
For 21 fucking years, Comley's put
food on my table, protection money.

307
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,743
- Chris didn't know going in.
- Bullshit.

308
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,788
Want my DVD player?
You can watch <i>Grumpy Old Men</i>.

309
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,373
You gonna be a fucking funny boy now?

310
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,667
You Sopranos.

311
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:38,756
You hope you and your uncle can settle,
not be invited to a fucking sit-down.

312
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,383
You got a crew of cowards
you don't control.

313
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,052
Here we go. Here we go.

314
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,595
You got a ruling?

315
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,311
The kids make restitution to Junior.

316
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,979
Done. It's done.

317
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,237
Christopher Moltisanti's
a fucking loose cannon.

318
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,072
You get him out of a sick bed?

319
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,615
Hey, fuck that shit.

320
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,747
Giacomino, how you feeling?

321
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:16,293
I may be acting boss while your old
man's a guest of the government...

322
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,797
...but I wish somebody'd tell my bowels.
They don't obey.

323
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,300
Ah, the fucking chemo.

324
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,138
Maybe I should name a successor.

325
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,933
This day and age?
Who wants the fucking job?

326
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,480
Your mom tells me you got
a girl coming in to help.

327
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,774
That's good.

328
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,112
All right, I gotta go.

329
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,073
I'll see you soon.

330
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,578
We okay?

331
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,121
All right.

332
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,377
The smoke he hires for his own mother.

333
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,300
Hey, Mikey, how's the boy?

334
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,343
- What boy?
- The one you sleep with.

335
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:09,597
I'm just kidding.

336
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,140
How's Jun treating you?

337
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:15,728
We're covering our nut. Your nephew retarded?
Likes to play with trucks?

338
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,606
What if Jerry Lewis heard
you talking like that?

339
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,567
No, that's muscular dystrophy, Tony.

340
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:26,155
Too bad they don't have a telethon
for fuckface-itis. They find a cure?

341
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,282
I'm just kidding you.

342
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,118
Come on, you're a good sport.
You all right?

343
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,078
- Yeah.
- You all right?

344
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,331
- Yeah.
- I'll see you later.

345
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,587
- Double cappuccino suprema.
- Double cappuccino suprema.

346
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,342
Thanks. Excuse me.

347
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,888
A guy fitting the description
does work in this branch.

348
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,808
His name is Edguardo Arnaz.
Him and his gay lover both work here.

349
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,685
And I got the address.

350
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,357
- Paulie, are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

351
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,026
Again with the rape of the culture.

352
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,613
Can we go find these Spice Girls
and get this over with?

353
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,534
Two small café du jours.

354
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,548
That's it!

355
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,384
What happened?

356
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,928
Beats me.

357
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,972
Did you say something to her?

358
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,975
I know how to talk to people.

359
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,143
These blacks.

360
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,063
Who knows what they'll
take the wrong way.

361
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,690
So she's gone!

362
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,654
<i>Traffic and weather
on this Tuesday morning.</i>

363
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:55,411
<i>On the westside, there's a delay
as you get out of the Lincoln Tunnel.</i>

364
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,248
<i>About a 25-minute delay if you're
approaching near Deer Route 3.</i>

365
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,668
<i>The queue beginning just
before the Bergen Viaduct.</i>

366
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,714
You had orders.
Why didn't you pay his restitution?

367
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:11,010
Restitution, okay. But you know
how much your uncle wants? $15.

368
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,263
You jack the wrong truck,
that's what happens.

369
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,812
I didn't notice you rushing to give
back your fucking DVD player.

370
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,856
I'm enjoying it very much.

371
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,693
I screened <i>The Bank Dick</i> last night.
"Did you warble, my little wren?"

372
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,403
I'm not gonna pay it.

373
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,239
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm serious.

374
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,075
Serious is what happens
if you don't pay, by me.

375
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,997
In my thoughts, I use the technique
of positive visualization.

376
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,291
How come I always feel undermined?

377
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:47,713
By what I did on the Triborough Towers
alone, I should've been made.

378
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,467
I'm fucking serious, Tony.

379
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,926
The books are closed.

380
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,220
Did you talk to Jackie about me?

381
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,058
They're not accepting any
new members, okay?

382
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:04,146
You know, you got a reputation
for immaturity...

383
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:08,233
...and it's not helping, not paying
the tributes the acting boss demands.

384
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,152
Acting boss, my ass.

385
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,823
Everybody knows you really run things
since Jackie became the "chemo-sabi."

386
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,870
Open the fucking door.
Open the fucking door!

387
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,631
All right.

388
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,633
All right. Fuck it.

389
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,301
But 15 grand is too much!

390
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,011
I'll tell you what.

391
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:40,432
You give me the 15 K,
I'll talk to Uncle Junior...

392
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,102
...and maybe I can get it to around 10.

393
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,070
One more thing.

394
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:57,533
You leave Comley Trucking and every
other item that belongs to Jun...

395
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,703
...including his hemorrhoid doughnut,
the fuck alone. Got it?

396
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,039
Yeah.

397
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,677
"Did you warble, my little wren?"

398
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,054
What do you think his commission will be?

399
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,515
Two, three grand. Ten to Junior.

400
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,852
We're lucky we net 500 bucks
from the whole thing.

401
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,240
Who is it?

402
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,785
What?

403
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,045
Mr. Arnaz?

404
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,547
What do you want?

405
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,758
You seen a schoolteacher's
Saturn around here?

406
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,597
Come here!

407
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,058
Anybody else here, Desi?

408
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,853
- Eddie, I'm ready.
- Yep.

409
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,229
Here comes Lucy.

410
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,149
Those people at the airport
shuttle are always late.

411
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,737
- Eddie!
- You boys drove off in the wrong car.

412
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,948
We ain't saying shit until
there's an attorney.

413
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,659
Well, go ahead. Make a statement.

414
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,953
I got fucking Johnny Cochran here!

415
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,551
You boys put a crimp in my week.

416
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,638
Get over there.

417
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,808
Hey, Puss, here's the fucking set.

418
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,269
Look.

419
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,314
Fucking car's been chopped. Useless.

420
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,649
That's not it.

421
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,152
Then why is that car inside there...?
That Dodge?

422
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:01,740
Why is that motherfucker wearing
the fucking plate number I had all week?

423
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,493
- I don't know.
- Here's what's gonna happen.

424
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,664
The two of youse are climbing over
that fence and shagging those plates.

425
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,499
But the razor wire.

426
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:15,837
Then one of you stays with us while
the other goes and boosts another Saturn.

427
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:27,766
- On the lookout for ducks?
- Know the old man pretty good.

428
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:31,853
Don't look so sad. Remember how
pissed you were about the pool filter?

429
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:37,109
That were special, them coming here, huh?
Don't you think?

430
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,694
I wasn't into it.

431
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,866
What time's Grandma getting here?

432
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,411
She had to drive Fanny to the doctor's.

433
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:51,039
Then she is picking up my parents
and they're coming here.

434
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,209
They're each bringing some <i>antipasto</i>.

435
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:59,339
I complain about my mother,
about how she just sits at home...

436
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,966
...and feels sorry for herself.

437
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:06,013
But she's always ready to drive those
friends of hers that can't drive.

438
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,392
I'm proud of her. It gives me hope.

439
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,623
It's getting chilly out here.

440
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,544
Make plenty of noise before
you open the front door.

441
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,921
You never know who's in there.

442
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,925
There's my <i>Star-Ledger</i>. Thanks.

443
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:48,930
Oh, this street, another pain in the ass.

444
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,271
She broke her wrist
on the steering column.

445
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,148
A minor concussion.

446
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,692
What about the other woman?

447
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,696
Hip.

448
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,702
We were at the hospital till 2 a.m...

449
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:15,999
...talking to her doctor
and the staff gerontoligist.

450
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,794
They say she shouldn't
live alone anymore.

451
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,216
She can't manage the telephone.

452
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,887
Yet you say she's healthy and alert.

453
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,306
Like a bull.

454
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,600
Why?

455
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,103
I'm just thinking.

456
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:41,274
I know there are other doctors there,
but you know from your own life...

457
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:46,029
...that depression can cause accidents,
poor performance or worse.

458
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,031
So, what are you saying?

459
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,575
Unconsciously she tried
to whack her friend?

460
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:55,038
It's interesting that you would even
take that from what I said.

461
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:01,044
Either way, she could need
a change in her living situation...

462
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,629
...be around more people.

463
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,173
We were looking at Green Grove.

464
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:06,842
It's a beautiful facility.

465
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:11,888
It's more like a hotel at Cap d'Antibes.

466
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,100
Yeah.

467
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:21,064
- But to her it's a nursing home.
- She needs to see the distinction.

468
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:25,402
That, in fact, she's embarking
on a rewarding chapter.

469
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:30,532
I know seniors who are
inspired and inspiring.

470
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,290
You're not forgetting us, buddy?

471
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,085
Ladies.

472
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,677
Hey, Kenny Portugal said to say hello.

473
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,429
Oh, yeah. Kenny.

474
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,186
The fuck is with this cocksucker?

475
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,564
Back up! Mr. Scorsese, good evening.

476
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,360
Marty!

477
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,529
<i>Kundun!</i> I liked it.

478
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,750
So my boy at Comley...

479
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,669
...said there's a load of Italian suits.

480
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:28,590
Those unload fast.
Mario'll take the whole load.

481
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,135
He says shipment moves Thursday at 6 a.m.

482
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:38,600
Give me one good reason
I should not jack this truck.

483
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,605
It's Junior's own fault. He gives us
no choice except to do it again.

484
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,690
Taking that outrageous tribute.

485
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:50,195
He shits on our heads, we're supposed
to say thanks for the hat.

486
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,449
I'm getting nowhere playing
by the rules. Fuck Tony.

487
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,785
"The books are closed." Blow me.

488
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,286
That's some true shit.

489
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:01,623
They're not confirming any
new made guys. How come?

490
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,544
Fucking chaos. Nobody knows
who's running things anymore.

491
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:10,340
Guys don't know who to make payments
up the ladder to in some cases.

492
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,802
I'm talking about the year 2000.
The millennium.

493
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,388
Where do we go from here?

494
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,776
Ma, this Virginia ham...

495
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,279
Go on, get yourself some more.

496
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,281
No, I'm full.

497
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:35,991
It's good, though.

498
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,827
You never let me feed you.

499
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,833
So getting back to what
we were talking about.

500
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,876
- You want that lamp?
- Lie down.

501
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:51,881
That lamp, that's real ormolu.
You know what that's worth when it's new?

502
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,384
We're fixed good lamp-wise, thank you.

503
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,761
Take it and take the Barcalounger.

504
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,766
Somebody's gotta take
this stuff before I die.

505
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,478
Otherwise there's gonna be
a lot of stuff here...

506
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,815
...that the junkman's gonna
have to cart off to the dump.

507
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:13,987
Mom, you're not gonna die.
Your stuff won't be hauled off to the dump.

508
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:18,700
Plan for the future. The most rewarding
chapter of your life's coming up.

509
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:23,121
- You know my good jewelry?
- The stuff Dad gave you.

510
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,875
Some of those pieces came
right out of Cartier's window.

511
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,836
Listen, Carm doesn't want it.

512
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,588
Not now.

513
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,885
We want you to live long and wear your
sparklers to your grandkids' graduations.

514
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,929
I gave it all to your cousin Josephine.

515
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,682
What the fuck? The good jewelry?

516
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,893
She always admired it.

517
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,853
They don't have much.

518
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,982
You gave her Cartier rings,
and you give me a vibrating chair?

519
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,903
Your wife never showed
any interest in my jewels.

520
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,698
She never complimented me
on any of it, as I remember.

521
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:04,079
Before you do more damage to yourself
or your grandchildrens' inheritance...

522
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,997
...you'll stop living alone.

523
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,541
I'm not going to that nursing home.

524
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:12,754
Green Grove is a retirement community!
It's like a hotel at Captain Teeb's!

525
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,130
Who's he?

526
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,884
A captain who owns luxury
hotels or something.

527
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:22,764
I talked to Mrs. DiCaprio, and she's
got a corner suite available.

528
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,933
It's available. It'll go fast.

529
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,560
Of course it's available.
Somebody died!

530
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:33,108
You gotta stop with this black poison
cloud all the time. I can't take it!

531
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,485
Oh, poor you!

532
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,947
I got problems at work, problems at home.

533
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,700
I got a friend diagnosed with cancer.

534
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,578
Most parents would be grateful
if their children did this!

535
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,622
I'm not going to that place.

536
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:51,751
I will go to court and get power
of attorney and place you there.

537
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,128
Then kill me now.

538
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,797
Go on, go into the ham...

539
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,426
...and take the carving knife
and stab me here.

540
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:04,848
Here! Now please, it would hurt me
less than what you just said.

541
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,350
I know seniors that are inspired!

542
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,947
Yo, money, we said we'd meet out front,
and you're not even dressed!

543
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,824
I'm taking a pass.

544
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:27,370
What? It's Italian suits, Christopher.

545
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:31,833
There was a time when being with Tony's
crew was all I ever dreamed of.

546
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,169
So what am I doing?

547
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,546
This is some fucking note here.

548
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,797
Don't wake her up.

549
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,258
Come on, it's 5:15.

550
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:45,096
Maybe one reason things are so fucked
in the organization these days...

551
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,184
...is guys running off not
listening to middle management.

552
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,228
"Fuck Tony." That's a quote.

553
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,689
We have to stick together.

554
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,066
Why be in a crew?

555
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,651
Why be a gangster?

556
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,361
Hey, coach?

557
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:01,696
Suck my dick.

558
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:21,883
Yo! Hey! Yo!
We need some help over here!

559
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:29,390
Okay, let's be very cool, yo!
Get down out of the cab!

560
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,226
You heard the motherfucker.

561
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,604
I'm a friend of Billy's.
Your friend on the inside.

562
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,732
Yeah, cool. "Increase the peace,"
that's our motto.

563
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,070
- I'm gonna take my lunch, okay?
- Yeah, whatever. Come on.

564
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,410
Hold up, man.
You can't drive a Fisher Price.

565
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,876
What's with the gun pointed sideways?

566
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:03,925
Get out!

567
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,886
Come on, get down!
You drive, I'll direct you.

568
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,142
Jesus!

569
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,728
Control your shit, fool!

570
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,943
Fuck, I'm fucked! Fuck!

571
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,946
Fuck!

572
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,368
Fuck! Junior-fucking-Soprano's
gonna go ape-shit. Fuck!

573
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,957
You excited about coming
to live with us, hon?

574
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,294
You will be. Trust me.

575
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,672
Look, Ma, here's your stuff.

576
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,800
Wow, they made good time.

577
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,972
You got your own bed and your dresser.

578
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,976
You know, when my grandmother
went to live... elsewhere...

579
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,979
...they weren't allowed personal effects.

580
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,819
All right, Ma, sign right here.

581
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:16,831
Yes?

582
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,084
Mr. Soprano, do you have an Uncle Junior?

583
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,961
He tracked me down here?

584
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,797
Line two? Here you go.

585
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,591
I'll call him back.

586
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,636
He'll return the call. He did?

587
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:35,058
It's urgent. She said he sounded upset.
He'll call back.

588
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:43,024
Livia, did you ever hear the old Italian saying?
My aunt used to go:

589
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,493
What's that mean, Bonnie?

590
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,664
Time and patience change
the mulberry leaf to silk.

591
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,721
You gonna be all right?

592
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,057
Yeah, sure.

593
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,351
Thanks for all your help.

594
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,271
I'll make us a nice lunch.

595
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:25,274
I've got some fantastic
prosciutto in there.

596
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,654
Hello?

597
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,073
Yeah. It's Christopher.

598
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:37,453
I've been calling for hours.
Call me on an outside line.

599
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,096
T, don't get mad.
There's been a little shit.

600
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,473
- <i>I had nothing to do with it...</i>
- Spit it out!

601
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,101
Brendan hit Comley again.

602
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,103
He what?

603
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:07,775
- And the driver, you know...
- No, I don't know.

604
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,363
He caught some friendly fire
or something and he's gone.

605
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,074
Oh, fuck.

606
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,452
What do we do, T?
Brendan didn't fence the load.

607
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,080
He's thinking it was Mario
who dimed us to Junior last time.

608
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,707
Fuck!

609
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,560
Hey, Ton.

610
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,646
Sorry you have to wreck
your Saturday like this.

611
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:51,444
You boys. You boys, I'll tell you.

612
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,824
It's beautiful stuff, though.

613
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,910
- Ton, I'm so sorry.
- Shut up.

614
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,954
Just so you realize I had
nothing to do with this.

615
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,707
- Ton, that's true. He stood home.
- Shut up.

616
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,001
Stood home?

617
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:13,007
Did you do anything to stop it?
Did you offer any guidance?

618
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,636
What do we mean when we say leadership?

619
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:20,973
Part of it's the crank. But I'm going
into detox, swear on my mother.

620
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:24,852
Brendan, shut the fuck up.
You want to get me clipped?

621
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,190
What are we gonna do?

622
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:34,487
You're gonna put these suits back
in the truck and give them back.

623
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,988
Fuck!

624
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,491
Then call my uncle
and tell him it's done.

625
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,577
What about the dead guy?

626
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,206
Prod him with a stick.
Light a candle to St. Anthony.

627
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,041
But I think you're fucked.

628
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,379
Ton...

629
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,675
...what if this didn't go back?
Would it be a problem?

630
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,473
I don't see you assholes putting
that rack, and that rack...

631
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,976
...and this rack here back in the truck.

632
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:17,697
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

633
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,077
Hey, Mr. Miller, your car is back.

634
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:27,123
My wife dropped me off and there
it was, in my parking spot.

635
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,500
My Uncle Pussy helped my dad locate it.

636
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,085
Uncle Pussy?

637
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,796
He's in the car business.

638
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,925
I don't know what to say to your dad,
I mean, thanks of course.

639
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:40,011
It's nice and clean too.

640
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,388
Whoa, different keys!

641
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:47,602
It's probably too much to hope
my papers are still inside the trunk.

642
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,854
It's a different color.

643
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,527
My dad's a hero.

644
00:45:56,921 --> 00:46:00,383
<i>Did you actually lose consciousness
like with the ducks?</i>

645
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,093
No.

646
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:08,307
Just a shortness of breath and
the white spots in my field of vision.

647
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,268
Improvement.

648
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,728
Because I'm sad to put my mother away?

649
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,940
Sad is good. Unconscious isn't.

650
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:21,529
She'll be in very good hands.
You've done the best for her.

651
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,283
She won't speak to me.

652
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,996
That is sad. But whose choice is that?

653
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,498
Somehow that doesn't make it any better.

654
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:37,211
Can you admit to yourself
that yes, you're sad...

655
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,339
...but you're angry and full of rage?

656
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:41,882
I'm sad.

657
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:44,385
It's hard to admit that...

658
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:48,306
...you may have feelings of hatred
towards your mother, isn't it?

659
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,391
You're out of your tree.

660
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,603
Listen carefully.
Of course you love her.

661
00:46:55,646 --> 00:47:00,192
What I'm trying to say is,
own the anger instead of displacing it.

662
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,864
Otherwise it defines your life.
It needs to be acknowledged.

663
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:08,659
It's a good thing time is up.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

664
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,119
"Hate your mother."

665
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,692
Shit.

666
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,363
A what do you call it? A menu.

667
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,867
Press two if you know
your party's extension.

668
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:53,037
Is that an operator or
an answering machine?

669
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,998
Let's see. Hello? Hello?

670
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,000
Hello?

671
00:47:58,626 --> 00:47:59,960
Hello?

672
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,464
Press zero. Hello?

673
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,717
Hello? Hello?
