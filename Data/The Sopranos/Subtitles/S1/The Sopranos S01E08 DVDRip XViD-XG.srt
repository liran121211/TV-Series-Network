00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:39,580
Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti

3
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:50,858
{y:i}In the Czech Republic too,
{y:i}we love pork.

4
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:53,777
{y:i}Ever had our sausages?

5
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:02,096
{y:i}In the Czech Republic too,
{y:i}we love pork.

6
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,015
{y:i}You ever had our sausages?

7
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,571
Adriana?

8
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:30,290
{y:i}In the Czech Republic too,
{y:i}we love pork. Ever had our sausages?

9
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:36,369
Emil Kolar?

10
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:41,528
- Help you?
- Salami sub, hold the mayo.

11
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:43,487
We're out of mayo.

12
00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:49,286
Change my meat to black forest.

13
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:00,324
You killed me.

14
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:02,044
What do you want me to do?

15
00:03:02,164 --> 00:03:03,243
I want to tell you.

16
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:05,283
What?
You come here every night.

17
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:07,043
You fucked up.

18
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:09,122
What do you mean?

19
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:11,602
Here's these.

20
00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:13,561
Where'd you find them?

21
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,641
One in the table. Three in my skull.

22
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
You will have our sausages.

23
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,279
Get rid of these.

24
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,759
Let go of me! Let go!

25
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:40,436
- I would've wrapped it...
- That's okay. A computer!

26
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,795
This one got such a good write-up,
I got one for myself.

27
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:46,995
- Let's move on, okay?
- Congratulations. God bless.

28
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:54,793
You look gorgeous.
Who's your date?

29
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,873
What do you mean, Who's your date?

30
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,192
- Good to see you.
- Congratulations.

31
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:02,272
- Thank you.
- Melissa was beautiful up there.

32
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:04,831
Oh, Mama Livia, come stai, darling?

33
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:07,750
Listen to him,
with that my darling.

34
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,270
I am nobody's darling.

35
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,270
She never disappoints you.

36
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:15,109
Are you still seeing your
other women, Lorenzo?

37
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,948
Come on, Ma, let's mingle.

38
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:20,668
Sorry, the older she gets,
the worse she gets.

39
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:24,547
I heard disturbing shit last night.
I wanted to talk to you.

40
00:04:24,787 --> 00:04:28,146
But with the rehearsal dinner
and everything, you know...

41
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:30,586
There's the priest.
I'll be right back.

42
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:47,143
Federal indictments?
Where the fuck did you get this?

43
00:04:47,302 --> 00:04:52,301
I got a guy, his goomar works at FBI
headquarters as a word processor.

44
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,861
When's it coming down?

45
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:56,741
I don't know. When she knows,
she'll tell me.

46
00:04:56,941 --> 00:04:59,220
- Indictments? What the fuck?
- You sure?

47
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,579
It ain't just my source in Jersey. Half
of New York moved to Fort Lauderdale.

48
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:06,139
Fuck! They're gonna want my ass.

49
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:07,738
Why?

50
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:09,818
What do you mean, why? I'm O.C.

51
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:11,898
When'd you get your wings?

52
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:15,937
I didn't. Not yet, anyway.

53
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:19,136
Uncle Junior, you got anything to say?

54
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:22,296
You guys see indictments
under your bed at night.

55
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:26,415
You're ready to lam it. As far as
I'm concerned, it's speculation.

56
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:27,614
It's rumor.

57
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,094
Better be safe than sorry.
I say we duck for a while.

58
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,373
What're we gonna do, close shop?
We can't do that.

59
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,133
Tony, what do you think?

60
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:41,452
What the fuck are you asking him for?
I just gave you the answer.

61
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:45,451
He's right, we go, it's open season.
Albanians will be living in our houses.

62
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,650
I just gave a G-note
to Larry Boy's kid for the boost.

63
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,850
If I have to lam in a hurry,
I'd have duped her another time.

64
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:03,887
I gotta go. It's an emergency.
Say goodbye to your father for me.

65
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:10,206
I agree with my uncle.
He calls the shots, we do it.

66
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:13,085
Well, maybe for today,
for right now...

67
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:16,965
...you were thinking that everybody
should do spring cleaning?

68
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:19,004
That was my next comment.

69
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:55,197
Think they'll come over the weekend?

70
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:57,356
They're coming someday.

71
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:04,595
- Where's the rest of the money?
- Everywhere.

72
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:06,315
Get it.

73
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:11,954
- What else?
- How about your phone numbers?

74
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:14,793
Anybody who's anybody's in my head.

75
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:24,471
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Just, here we go.

76
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,031
Here.

77
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,430
Why now? Why the fuck now,
just when things were going good?

78
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:42,707
- Boot your computer, cops are coming.
- So?

79
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:45,667
You want them to see
that porno you downloaded?

80
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:56,785
Better give me your jewelry.

81
00:07:57,504 --> 00:07:59,424
Oh, Jesus!

82
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:03,063
We can't produce receipts.
You want them stealing it?

83
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:08,662
Come on.

84
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:11,822
Not my engagement ring.
This isn't stolen.

85
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:14,461
Is it?

86
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:16,141
No.

87
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,100
What do you think I am?

88
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,820
Come on, give me that!

89
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:49,294
Adriana!

90
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:53,573
It ate my whole script now!

91
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:59,732
You're still on the file.
You deleted the text.

92
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:02,331
The fuck... Whatever.
You fucking asshole!

93
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:05,411
Stop with the hysteria,
would you please?

94
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:09,970
If you're gonna keep behaving
like a baby, I'm not gonna help you.

95
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,210
I mean it.

96
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,409
At least you work that
squirrel program in the restaurant.

97
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,488
There, the text came back.

98
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:23,007
- You put it in buffer memory.
- What do you think?

99
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:24,727
Of the script?

100
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:28,806
Babe, I can't give an opinion
every time you add a sentence.

101
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:31,286
I gotta have the whole story flow.

102
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:33,485
I'm starting with the dialogue.

103
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:45,963
I manuged to get the drop on him?

104
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:49,042
Do you mean, I managed
to get the drop on him?

105
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:53,001
Or is he saying manuge,
like mannuggia I'americano?

106
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,799
My Tennessee William.

107
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,318
Where you going?

108
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:12,317
Get over here.

109
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:16,757
I have never seen you
apply yourself like this.

110
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,796
I love movies. You know that.

111
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:22,116
That smell in Blockbuster...

112
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:25,835
...that candy and carpet smell,
I get high off it.

113
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:29,074
Gonna let all this love
and knowledge go to waste?

114
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:33,193
My cousin Gregory's girlfriend, Amy,
who works for Tarantino, said:

115
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:37,632
Mob stories are always hot.
I can make my mark.

116
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:44,071
With these indictments, shouldn't
you put the script away for a while...

117
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:46,151
...and get rid of evidence?

118
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,230
Travel light. Free bird.

119
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:55,269
You stole this computer, plus
the one you just gave Melissa.

120
00:10:58,508 --> 00:10:59,548
I'm writing.

121
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,908
Turn on channel 6.

122
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:02,987
Turn on channel 6.

123
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:09,546
{y:i}New Jersey Attorney General,
{y:i}James Ricci, stated at a fundraiser...

124
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:12,705
{y:i}... that a grand jury has been
{y:i}empaneled to investigate...

125
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:16,945
{y:i}... possible Mob activities in the
{y:i}Garden State with indictments to follow.

126
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:20,624
{y:i}With us is syndicated columnist
and author of Mafia:

127
00:11:20,904 --> 00:11:23,583
America's Longest-Running
Soap Opera, Jeffrey Wernick.

128
00:11:23,903 --> 00:11:26,023
{y:i}- Welcome.
{y:i}- Pleasure to be here.

129
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:29,902
{y:i}For years, FBI has been telling us
{y:i}that the Mafia is all but dead.

130
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:31,502
{y:i}Let me interject.

131
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:36,421
{y:i}While it is true that the Mob is
{y:i}getting a standing eight-count...

132
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:40,060
{y:i}... I wouldn 't call the fight.
{y:i}The government knows this best.

133
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,779
{y:i}Murder, truck hijacking and money
{y:i}laundering are expected inquiries.

134
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:47,299
{y:i}Do we know names of those
{y:i}who 'll be indicted?

135
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:50,378
{y:i}The indictments are sealed,
{y:i}but with the recent death...

136
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:53,177
{y:i}... of acting Di Meo family boss,
{y:i}Jackie Aprile...

137
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:56,897
{y:i}... my sources tell me that
{y:i}Corrado Junior Soprano...

138
00:11:57,137 --> 00:12:00,176
{y:i}... was made new boss
{y:i}after the death of Aprile.

139
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:04,255
{y:i}The Sopranos have long, historic
{y:i}ties to the New York families.

140
00:12:04,575 --> 00:12:06,735
{y:i}What about possible
{y:i}murder charges?

141
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,414
{y:i}They will undoubtedly be focused
{y:i}on the as yet unsolved...

142
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:14,653
{y:i}... execution-style slaying of Soprano
{y:i}family associate, Brendan Filone.

143
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:18,772
{y:i}- Was it part of a power struggle?
{y:i}- Interesting.

144
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:21,372
No one would have ranked him
as associate!

145
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:24,051
{y:i}- A loyal soldier,
{y:i}and he winds up dead...

146
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,851
Soldier?

147
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:29,050
Brendan Filone? Associate?
Soldier? Fuck you!

148
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,650
Jesus!

149
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:42,647
Did you see it from the beginning?
Did they mention my name?

150
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:47,646
Stop the fucking chitchat, all right?
I gotta go.

151
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:54,965
Nobody makes guinso gravy
like you, Nana.

152
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:58,564
You know, I'm up at Bard
waiting for my care package.

153
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:00,364
I don't like that word, Jason.

154
00:13:00,644 --> 00:13:01,644
What, guinso?

155
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:04,883
- The word is offensive!
- She's right, Jason.

156
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,283
Sorry, Nana. What's it mean?

157
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:09,522
- It's from guinea.
- What's that?

158
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,602
It's a derogation.

159
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,361
I have a patient.
You wouldn't say guinea to him.

160
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:19,640
Italian male seeing a shrink.
Let me guess: Mother issues.

161
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,720
- Why wouldn't you?
- Just wouldn't.

162
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,199
You'd be scared?
Is he in the Mafia?

163
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:28,238
No, I shouldn't have mentioned it!
Can we change the subject?

164
00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:31,358
No way. Mom, is he
in the Mob, or what?

165
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:33,277
He's not a mobster, is he?

166
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:37,396
Nobody knows better than you, Richard.
I can't discuss my patients.

167
00:13:37,556 --> 00:13:41,156
I just hope he's not one of those
crumbs on the news.

168
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:45,795
Just refer him to another doctor.
You can do that, couldn't you?

169
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:47,554
Grate the cheese, Dad.

170
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:49,514
Sure she can.

171
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,113
That might be what
you would do, Richard.

172
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,633
Now I remember why we got divorced.

173
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:58,992
Why refer him to another doctor?
He's my patient.

174
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:02,871
You can't treat sociopaths. You
shouldn't help scum with bed-wetting.

175
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:06,311
You have no idea who this man is,
and yet you call him scum.

176
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:09,950
People like him are the reason
Italian-Americans have a bad image.

177
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,150
I agree.

178
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,989
Ask any American to describe an
Italian-American in this country...

179
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:19,468
...invariably he's gonna reference
{y:i}The Godfather, Goodfellas...

180
00:14:19,788 --> 00:14:20,908
Good movies.

181
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,867
...and the rest will mention pizza.
- Good movies to eat pizza by.

182
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:28,346
Stop it, Jason!
I never said he was in the Mafia.

183
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:30,586
We'll never see an Italian president.

184
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,505
And that's my patient's fault?

185
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:36,465
I realize that you're involved
in the Anti-Defamation lobby.

186
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:41,344
So go after Hollywood if you feel
you must. But leave my patient alone.

187
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:42,543
It's a synergy.

188
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:46,383
News items and the portrayal
of Italian-Americans as gangsters!

189
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:51,622
Wasn't the Italian Anti-Def deal
started by Joe Colombo? A mobster?

190
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:54,341
Italians Against Discrimination
did a study.

191
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,620
In its height, the Mafia in the U.S.
Had less than 5000 members.

192
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,780
And yet, that tiny,
insignificant fraction...

193
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,939
...casts such a dark shadow over
20 million hard-working Americans.

194
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:09,498
At this point in our cultural history,
Mob movies are classic American cinema.

195
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:10,738
Like Westerns.

196
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,737
I have to agree there, Rich.

197
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:15,817
You never saw the Scotch-Irish
pissing and moaning...

198
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:19,336
...about being portrayed
as rustlers and gunslingers.

199
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:20,656
That's absurd!

200
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:23,175
See what you started
with your gravy, Nana?

201
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:26,735
To we, the 20 million.

202
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:28,694
{y:i}- Salute!
{y:i}- Salute!

203
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:31,774
{y:i}- Cent'anni.
{y:i}- Salute.

204
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,570
What?

205
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,250
Come here.
We're exterminating.

206
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,409
I'm busy now.

207
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,609
Get some sfogliatelle for the guys.

208
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:56,329
Yeah.

209
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:12,325
Twenty-nine.

210
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:21,484
Here you go, big guy.

211
00:16:30,762 --> 00:16:32,242
Hey, Gino. What can I get you?

212
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:35,281
- Get me some...
- Number 34, right here!

213
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:38,160
He just went out
to get gas in his car.

214
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,240
I go out, fuck your sister, come
back Saturday, I go to the front?

215
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:43,559
I said he could.

216
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,839
Poppin' Fresh, I'm in no mood!

217
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:48,558
I'm next, now get
a fucking pastry box.

218
00:16:49,838 --> 00:16:51,558
Gino, what can I get you?

219
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,317
Dougie, let him go first.

220
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,277
He don't make the rules here!

221
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:59,236
All right, two Neapolitan loaves...

222
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:03,435
You touch a single crust, you'll
wish you took that job at McDonalds!

223
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:04,555
Fuck you!

224
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:06,675
Okay, take a walk.

225
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:10,834
- What about my bread?
- You come back in 10 minutes.

226
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:12,713
What do you think you're doing?

227
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:14,233
Come on.

228
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:24,471
Get up, I'm not gonna hurt you.

229
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,830
What is it?
Do I look like a pussy to you?

230
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,190
- No.
- Seriously, be honest, I won't get mad.

231
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:36,709
So why give me a hard time
and talk to me like I'm nothing?

232
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:38,948
I'm sorry.

233
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:41,108
Get a pastry box.

234
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:43,307
Move it!

235
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:47,227
That's better.

236
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,546
Now fill it with cannoli,
sfogliatelle and napoleons.

237
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:57,704
Move.

238
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:01,744
Good.

239
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,342
Give me the box. Come on.

240
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:18,420
Next time you see my face,
show some respect.

241
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,100
I will.

242
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:24,419
You motherfucker!

243
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:26,019
You shot my foot!

244
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:29,698
- It happens.
- You fucking asshole!

245
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:39,136
If I'm getting an invitation to the
dance, I wish the feds would hurry up.

246
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,056
You heard what the news said.

247
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:43,935
The way things are working,
it's Junior's party.

248
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:46,895
That was a far-thinking plan
you had there, Tone.

249
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:50,854
I called you last Christmas.

250
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:52,094
Fuck this!

251
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:54,853
The sfogliatelle!
What's wrong with you?

252
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:58,572
What are you doing?
You brought up in a barn, or what?

253
00:18:58,732 --> 00:19:00,172
What's the matter with you?

254
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:04,651
This is no time to go on the rag.
Not with the indictment coming down.

255
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:08,330
Take Georgie, go in the bathroom,
sweep for bugs.

256
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,210
Come on.

257
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:19,968
Well, I hope they'll be all right.

258
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:21,688
Who?

259
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,487
- The guys.
- What about me?

260
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:27,446
They didn't even
mention your name on TV.

261
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:31,886
Amazing, huh? That news guy,
he said the words Brendan Filone ...

262
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:35,685
...the hairs on the back of my neck,
they fucking stood up.

263
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,005
I knew the guy.

264
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:40,564
They made him look like
John-fucking-Gotti.

265
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:42,363
I brought him around here.

266
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:47,243
Tony wouldn't have never known him
if it wasn't for me.

267
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:48,722
I had no idea.

268
00:20:07,718 --> 00:20:09,438
Who is it? I'm sleeping.

269
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:12,557
- Carmela.
- Oh, come on in.

270
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,277
I just said that in case
you were...

271
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:19,796
...that snooty-assed Mrs. Ryan
down the hall.

272
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:24,435
She is so shanty Irish,
and with all her airs.

273
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:27,354
- Come on, I'm taking you to brunch.
- What?

274
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,674
Get dressed.

275
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:30,394
What's wrong? Tell me.

276
00:20:30,634 --> 00:20:32,953
Why does something have to be wrong?

277
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:34,913
Meadow? She eats like a bird.

278
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:38,232
Everything is fine, Ma, relax!
Nothing is wrong.

279
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:43,071
You come here unannounced. I shouldn't
wonder if something's wrong?

280
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:48,270
Jeez, I'm sorry. It's a nice day,
I thought I would take you out.

281
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,429
I don't want to go out!

282
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:57,428
Is it Anthony? Those indictments?

283
00:20:57,668 --> 00:21:00,028
His father could take it in stride,
but he can't.

284
00:21:00,588 --> 00:21:01,868
I don't believe you.

285
00:21:05,627 --> 00:21:07,067
Ma, will you get dressed?

286
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:10,426
- We just went to a wedding!
- That was a big to-do.

287
00:21:10,626 --> 00:21:13,505
This way we get to spend
some quality time.

288
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:18,144
The Manor will stop serving
brunch any minute.

289
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:23,703
Did he cheat on you again?

290
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:29,102
I try to do something nice.
I come here to take you out.

291
00:21:29,342 --> 00:21:33,901
You think I have some other agenda
that I have to talk to you about?

292
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:35,861
Don't flatter yourself.

293
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:39,980
{y:i}I'II...
I'll throw something on.

294
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:45,499
Buckle your seat belt, Ma.

295
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,818
I can't find it! Where is it?

296
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,321
It's not definite.
I just thought I'd tell you.

297
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:15,961
In case I don't show up
for an appointment.

298
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:20,960
You're telling me you're planning
a vacation, but you're not sure when?

299
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,399
Right.

300
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:26,199
I may never go.

301
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:29,758
Let's put it this way:

302
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:33,997
There's a strong possibility
that it could happen.

303
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:40,436
Does this have anything to do
with what's been on the news lately?

304
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:47,594
If you suddenly stop coming
to your appointments...

305
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:50,314
...I will assume that you are
on vacation?

306
00:23:50,914 --> 00:23:53,593
And I should wait to be contacted?

307
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:56,073
That would be a good assumption.

308
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:06,271
- Who is it?
- Paulie. Open the door.

309
00:24:23,987 --> 00:24:26,027
I thought we were stepping out.

310
00:24:28,106 --> 00:24:29,706
I got two broads in the car.

311
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:32,425
You said Ad went to stay
at her mother's.

312
00:24:35,905 --> 00:24:39,504
No wonder. The place looks
like a fucking sty.

313
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,223
What's wrong?

314
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:47,422
Talk to me. This ain't like you, kid.

315
00:24:50,382 --> 00:24:52,182
I ran into Billy Cracciolo.

316
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:54,181
The meter maid?
What about him?

317
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:57,181
Told me the cops in Nutley
are looking for a guy.

318
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,460
Blew off a kid's toe for
no good reason in Russo's Bakery.

319
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,979
Drove a Lexus?

320
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:08,298
Does Tony know about this?

321
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:11,498
What's going on, Chrissy?

322
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:16,337
Been working my ass off on this script.
You know how many pages I got?

323
00:25:16,497 --> 00:25:17,616
Nineteen.

324
00:25:18,696 --> 00:25:20,576
That a lot or a little?

325
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:24,335
Books say a movie's supposed to be
about 120 pages.

326
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:26,895
I thought the computer would
do a lot of it.

327
00:25:27,374 --> 00:25:29,134
You're being frank
about the business...

328
00:25:29,414 --> 00:25:32,653
I would never do that.
It's only suggested by.

329
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:37,732
That writer, with the bullfights?
Blew his own fucking head off.

330
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:40,452
I bought a scriptwriting program.

331
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:43,811
My advice?
Put that thing down awhile.

332
00:25:43,931 --> 00:25:45,451
We get our joints copped.

333
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:48,610
Tomorrow, the words will come
blowing out your ass.

334
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,129
You ever feel like nothing
good would ever happen?

335
00:25:53,449 --> 00:25:55,849
Yeah. And nothing did. So what?

336
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:57,648
I'm alive, I'm surviving.

337
00:25:57,928 --> 00:26:00,968
That's it.
I don't want to just survive.

338
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:05,647
It says in movie-writing books that
every character has an arc, understand?

339
00:26:07,606 --> 00:26:11,606
Everybody starts out somewheres
and then they do something...

340
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:14,205
...it changes their life.
That's their arc.

341
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:16,245
Where's my arc?

342
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:21,044
All right, take Richard Kimble, right?

343
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:26,483
No, that's no good. His arc is
run, run, jump off the dam...

344
00:26:29,282 --> 00:26:31,482
Keanu Reeves, Devil's Advocate.

345
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:33,801
- AI.
- Right.

346
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:39,280
Keanu's a lawyer, gets all turned on
by money, power and the Devil.

347
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,039
Then his wife says, You're not
the man I married, leaves him.

348
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,439
You see the arc?

349
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:51,198
He starts down here, he ends up here.

350
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:53,677
Where's my arc, Paulie?

351
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:55,957
Kid...

352
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:59,916
...Richard Kimble, the Devil's
whatever, those are all make-believe.

353
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:02,915
I got no arc either.

354
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:07,954
I was born, grew up, spent a few years
in the Army, a few more in the can.

355
00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:11,194
And here I am. A half a wiseguy.
So what?

356
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:13,633
I got no identity.

357
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:17,193
Even Brendan Filone's got
an identity. He's dead.

358
00:27:17,832 --> 00:27:20,392
I killed that fucking Emil Kolar,
and nothing.

359
00:27:20,592 --> 00:27:22,391
I don't even move up a notch.

360
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:24,871
All I got is nightmares.

361
00:27:25,431 --> 00:27:27,830
That Polish, Czech,
whatever he is...

362
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,470
...is haunting me in my dreams
every night.

363
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,229
That happens. The more of them
you do, the better you'll sleep.

364
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:36,869
I had one prick for months
in my dreams.

365
00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:41,228
I feel like he's trying to tell me
we fucked up the night we buried him.

366
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:43,467
- We didn't.
- I'm in danger.

367
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:44,747
Can I ask a question?

368
00:27:44,907 --> 00:27:47,426
Why would he tell you
you're in danger...

369
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:50,506
...considering you put
a moonroof in his head?

370
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:53,145
What did we do wrong that night?

371
00:27:53,545 --> 00:27:56,545
The gun was hot, so the slugs
couldn't be traced to me.

372
00:27:56,745 --> 00:27:59,144
You know who had an ark?
Noah.

373
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,380
Is that him?

374
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,219
That would be some fucking
coincidence if it wasn't, wouldn't it?

375
00:28:28,738 --> 00:28:30,458
- Holy shit! Look.
- What?

376
00:28:30,698 --> 00:28:33,217
He was clean-shaven.
He's got a beard now.

377
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:36,017
You know what?
I read that. That happens.

378
00:28:36,217 --> 00:28:37,896
I always thought it was bullshit.

379
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,936
Look at his fingernails!

380
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,616
They're like a woman's.

381
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:44,215
I'm gonna fucking puke.

382
00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:51,254
Help me lift him and take him to Pine
Barrens before they build a condo here.

383
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:53,013
Georgie!

384
00:28:56,453 --> 00:28:58,652
I don't know about
selling this property.

385
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:02,052
I don't know about you,
but I sure could use an infusion...

386
00:29:02,252 --> 00:29:05,211
...if we're supporting Jase
after he graduates.

387
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:09,450
It's funny how even during our
marriage, we saw things differently.

388
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,809
I never saw this place
as an investment.

389
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:16,449
I always thought
that we'd build a house.

390
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,048
So are we gonna sell, or what?

391
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:22,288
For Jason.

392
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:26,327
I don't want to hear that you took
one of your Colleens on a cruise.

393
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,966
What's that supposed to mean,
Colleens?

394
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:32,365
We all know you're a sucker
for those Irish girls.

395
00:29:32,685 --> 00:29:35,405
Every Italian boy
bows down to the freckles.

396
00:29:35,645 --> 00:29:38,404
- I married you!
- Yeah, I was a mother figure.

397
00:29:38,724 --> 00:29:40,924
Don't bust my balls
with Freud-by-numbers.

398
00:29:41,204 --> 00:29:44,443
Don't bust my balls?
Richard, your calabrese is showing.

399
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:49,242
Are you implying by all this
I'm ashamed to be an Italian-American?

400
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:52,162
With all the poverty, starvation,
ethnic cleansing...

401
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:54,441
...and horrible shit in this world...

402
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:58,720
...you devote your energy to protecting
the dignity of Connie Francis!

403
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,999
You're worked up about my patient...

404
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:08,078
...a man who has no bearing on
who or where you are in this world.

405
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:11,158
Call him a patient.
The man's a criminal, Jennifer.

406
00:30:11,358 --> 00:30:14,717
And after a while, you're gonna
get beyond psychotherapy...

407
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:16,957
...with its cheesy moral relativism.

408
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:20,716
Finally, you're gonna get
to good and evil. And he's evil.

409
00:30:42,112 --> 00:30:44,031
Sorry I'm late. The alarm...

410
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:46,311
What is wrong with you?

411
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:48,150
I ain't been feeling good.

412
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,030
- I wipe my ass with your feelings.
- Thanks.

413
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,149
Drive the fucking car!

414
00:31:01,868 --> 00:31:06,187
We're under a microscope. I hear you
shot some kid because he made you wait!

415
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:08,666
- Fucking Paulie!
- Don't blame Paulie!

416
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:12,505
Nutley PD's got a description
and a make on the car!

417
00:31:12,665 --> 00:31:14,505
Why don't you leave a urine sample?

418
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:16,265
- Lf I could...
- Shut up!

419
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:19,704
Georgie comes in with vomit all over.
I ask, What the fuck?

420
00:31:20,104 --> 00:31:22,024
He said you're digging up some body!

421
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:23,823
- I was worried...
- Shut up!

422
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:26,263
- You want to get caught.
- I want to?

423
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:29,582
Yeah. I seen it before.
That's fucking cowboy-itis.

424
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:31,262
You want to be a bad guy?

425
00:31:31,462 --> 00:31:33,981
- I was worried that I didn't...
- Shut up!

426
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,459
Can I try and explain here?

427
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:47,378
I don't know, Tony.

428
00:31:48,138 --> 00:31:51,818
It's like the regular-ness of life
is too fucking hard for me.

429
00:31:51,938 --> 00:31:53,777
I don't know.

430
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:01,016
Look at you.

431
00:32:02,615 --> 00:32:04,775
I'll bet you're sleeping all the time.

432
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:07,135
It's the only thing I still enjoy.

433
00:32:09,414 --> 00:32:11,174
You know what I think?

434
00:32:11,574 --> 00:32:14,733
Maybe I have cancer.

435
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,372
Remember how Jackie got?

436
00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:19,052
Cancer?

437
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:23,131
Something fucking horrible
is going on inside my body.

438
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:26,331
Does this word cancer
pop into your mind a lot...

439
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:28,810
...a little bit, what?

440
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,569
Well, I'm just thinking,
maybe you're...

441
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:36,209
...depressed.
- Me?

442
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:39,128
I'm no fucking mental midget.

443
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:44,967
Right.

444
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,326
- Watch the...
- What?

445
00:32:49,606 --> 00:32:51,966
- Filter.
- Oh, fuck!

446
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:04,643
Maybe you got...

447
00:33:04,923 --> 00:33:09,642
...a serotonin problem,
or whatever the fuck they call it.

448
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:11,762
You know about that shit?

449
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:16,081
I saw it last night on a program.

450
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:19,920
What, take fucking Prozac?
Not this skinny guinea.

451
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,759
Let me ask a question.

452
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:29,038
You ever think about...

453
00:33:29,998 --> 00:33:31,398
...you know...

454
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:34,717
Fuck no!

455
00:33:36,237 --> 00:33:37,316
Good.

456
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:43,115
Bunch of losers blowing
their skulls all over the bathroom?

457
00:33:44,395 --> 00:33:46,315
It's fucking pathetic.

458
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,390
- Did you hear the doorbell?
- I'm in the middle of a game.

459
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,549
You'll be in the middle of
the street, you don't wise up.

460
00:34:24,827 --> 00:34:26,307
Anthony Soprano?

461
00:34:27,227 --> 00:34:28,626
Why are you in my yard?

462
00:34:29,146 --> 00:34:30,346
The gate was open.

463
00:34:30,506 --> 00:34:33,585
I'm Agent Harris, this is
Agent Driscol. May we come in?

464
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:34,865
If I say no?

465
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:37,864
If we were local, we wouldn't knock.

466
00:34:39,184 --> 00:34:40,304
What's your point?

467
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,503
We have a search warrant.
We know you have children.

468
00:34:43,703 --> 00:34:48,142
Our other team's out front. We don't
traumatize kids by kicking in doors.

469
00:34:48,342 --> 00:34:52,182
So why don't you take a minute
and tell them you have visitors.

470
00:35:15,257 --> 00:35:17,177
Any quarters, you can keep.

471
00:35:17,456 --> 00:35:19,296
You trying to bribe me?

472
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:23,015
Tell me what you're looking for,
I can save you time.

473
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:25,935
Any incriminating evidence
would be nice.

474
00:35:28,094 --> 00:35:29,414
Dad!

475
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:32,853
- I have an English paper!
- You gotta be shitting me.

476
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:35,573
I better have all my programs
when it comes back.

477
00:35:35,813 --> 00:35:36,933
Anthony!

478
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:42,012
What the hell are they doing
in my kitchen?

479
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:46,931
What are you doing?

480
00:35:47,171 --> 00:35:48,890
Forgot your lunch, just ask.

481
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,370
I'm very sorry.

482
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,849
How much would you say
that bowl cost?

483
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:55,849
- I'm not cleaning that up.
- Grasso, clean that.

484
00:35:56,129 --> 00:35:58,768
{y:i}Grasso, ti faccio un culo così.

485
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,328
Your ass!

486
00:36:01,648 --> 00:36:03,607
Take it easy.
Grasso, take it easy.

487
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:06,327
We'll be gone in a few minutes.

488
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:08,046
Let's wait in the living room.

489
00:36:08,246 --> 00:36:10,446
Clean up the bowl.

490
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:11,726
Come on.

491
00:36:20,004 --> 00:36:22,523
I know they're doing their job,
but I'm pissed.

492
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,483
Harris wasn't so bad.

493
00:36:24,763 --> 00:36:28,802
He was the biggest sneak out of
all of them. It's part of his act.

494
00:36:29,002 --> 00:36:31,002
That guy broke the bowl on purpose.

495
00:36:31,282 --> 00:36:33,121
He was just a klutz.

496
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:35,161
What was his last name?

497
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:37,800
- Rizzo, Razzo, what?
- Grasso.

498
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,760
Grasso. You think it's a coincidence
they sent him?

499
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,479
If he wasn't Italian, he'd be
at the office sweeping up. Jerk.

500
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:46,839
Bet they frisk him
before he goes home.

501
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,278
- Why?
- Why?

502
00:36:48,558 --> 00:36:51,438
Because he has a vowel
at the end of his name: Grasso.

503
00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:54,757
Does he think he'll make it to the top
by arresting his own people?

504
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:56,157
Pass the moo shu.

505
00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:58,196
He'll see. He'll learn.

506
00:36:58,276 --> 00:37:01,196
- We have a vowel.
- And you be proud of it!

507
00:37:01,356 --> 00:37:05,075
You'd think there was no Michelangelo,
the way they treat people.

508
00:37:05,555 --> 00:37:07,594
An Italian invented the telephone.

509
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:11,674
- Alexander Graham Bell was Italian?
- You see? You see what...?

510
00:37:11,874 --> 00:37:14,993
Antonio Meucci invented it,
and he got robbed!

511
00:37:15,153 --> 00:37:16,713
Everybody knows that!

512
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:19,632
Who invented the Mafia?

513
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:21,512
What?

514
00:37:21,752 --> 00:37:24,671
- La Cosa Nostra. Who invented that?
- Who cares.

515
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:28,390
Wasn't it Salvatore Lucania,
known as Charlie Lucky Luciano...

516
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:33,669
...who organized the five families:
Lucchese, Gambino, Bonanno, Profaci.

517
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:36,109
Is there something
you want to say to me?

518
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,708
I just like history, like you, Dad.

519
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:41,908
Can you shut the fuck up about it?

520
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:48,906
A.J., did you know
John Cabot was Italian?

521
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:51,266
- Whoa.
- Like he knows who that is.

522
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:53,425
The famous discoverer of Canada.

523
00:37:53,665 --> 00:37:55,105
The Bank of America.

524
00:37:55,345 --> 00:37:59,104
One of the biggest banks in the world,
started by an Italian.

525
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:02,343
The first American saint
was Italian. Mother Cabrini.

526
00:38:04,103 --> 00:38:06,623
Is it true the Chinese
invented spaghetti?

527
00:38:06,823 --> 00:38:09,662
Now think. Why would people
who eat with sticks...

528
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:12,341
...invent something
you need a fork to eat?

529
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:15,621
Here's more I bet you don't know.

530
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:19,980
More Italians fought for the U.S.
In WWII than any other ethnic group.

531
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,219
They won't tell you
about Sacco and Vanzetti.

532
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:25,779
The anti-Christs
that got the electric chair?

533
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:28,698
- Anarchists.
- Isn't it anti-Christs?

534
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:31,978
They were innocent and got
the chair because they were Italian.

535
00:38:32,258 --> 00:38:34,817
How are there two anti-Christs
and only one Christ?

536
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:36,377
So?

537
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:39,816
And of course, Francis Albert.

538
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:44,455
Will I see you next week?

539
00:38:44,735 --> 00:38:46,055
If you know something I don't.

540
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:49,774
You understand, I have to charge you
for the missed session.

541
00:38:51,094 --> 00:38:52,453
What do you mean?

542
00:38:52,653 --> 00:38:54,693
We agreed on that
on our first meeting.

543
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:56,853
But I just explained my situation.

544
00:38:57,173 --> 00:39:00,692
I understand, but it's important
that we respect the agreement.

545
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:05,331
- What if I got hit by a car?
- But you weren't.

546
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:08,450
- I know, but what if?
- But you weren't.

547
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,290
I know that, but what if?

548
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,849
- You weren't.
- Answer my fucking question!

549
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:15,249
I will not.

550
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:16,609
You won't?

551
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:19,248
All right, fine.

552
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:21,808
Fine, here. Here you go.

553
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:25,647
This is what it's all about.
Motherfucking, cocksucking money!

554
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:26,887
Here!

555
00:39:29,606 --> 00:39:33,525
I don't understand that, and I don't
appreciate being made to feel afraid.

556
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:37,165
I don't appreciate feeling like
I pour my heart to a call girl!

557
00:39:37,364 --> 00:39:40,124
- Is that how you see me?
- Not until now.

558
00:39:40,364 --> 00:39:44,043
But it's obvious you don't give a shit
about my situation.

559
00:39:44,203 --> 00:39:46,483
Otherwise, you wouldn't shake me down.

560
00:39:49,642 --> 00:39:51,882
It'll show as paid
on your next bill.

561
00:39:52,162 --> 00:39:53,281
Fine.

562
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:55,841
Stick it up your ass.

563
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,519
And how about Dr. Goldman here?

564
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:10,838
He was gonna be a tree surgeon,
but he fainted at the sight of sap!

565
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:12,877
Sap, ladies and gentlemen.

566
00:40:13,437 --> 00:40:16,797
Pace yourselves.
Don't spend it all in one place.

567
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:20,956
Movie night, right? Last week they
showed the Polish version of Rashomon.

568
00:40:21,356 --> 00:40:24,235
Everybody remembers the rape
exactly the same!

569
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,234
What's the matter with you, Corrado?

570
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:32,194
Headaches, that's all.
Not the kind you take aspirin for.

571
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:36,513
Now, tonight on our show, we have
Mitzi Gaynor, Sergio Franchi...

572
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:40,832
...and a woman from France will pull
light bulbs from her husband's throat.

573
00:40:41,032 --> 00:40:42,671
This woman can relate.

574
00:40:42,871 --> 00:40:44,311
We may have a bad apple.

575
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,231
Does Tony know about this?

576
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,870
What will you do?

577
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,790
There's not much to do.
We sit back and wait.

578
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:56,069
Don't let Tony know you know.
He's under enough pressure.

579
00:40:56,549 --> 00:40:58,068
Yeah.

580
00:40:58,348 --> 00:41:02,347
I'm sure he's telling his psychiatrist
it's all his mother's fault.

581
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:03,947
What, a psychiatrist?

582
00:41:04,147 --> 00:41:07,346
Yeah, a psychiatrist.

583
00:41:07,746 --> 00:41:10,346
He's been seeing one for a while now.

584
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:14,025
God only knows what he says.

585
00:41:14,225 --> 00:41:16,905
- Tony?
- Yes, Tony.

586
00:41:17,145 --> 00:41:20,344
Tony, who had such a terrible mother.

587
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:22,024
A psychiatrist?

588
00:41:22,184 --> 00:41:25,343
Yes, Junior. For chrissake!

589
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:29,422
Show of hands, how many people think
J.F. K is still alive? Come on.

590
00:41:30,062 --> 00:41:34,621
They should take a Zapruder film of
your salad bar. Hello? Help me out!

591
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:36,901
Who? The psychiatrist, I mean.

592
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:39,100
Do you think I know?

593
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,100
- What did you say to Tony about this?
- Me?

594
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,539
Nothing.

595
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:46,499
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

596
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:51,618
And, Junior, I don't want
there to be any repercussions.

597
00:41:53,617 --> 00:41:55,417
A psychiatrist?

598
00:41:56,137 --> 00:42:00,536
You're a broken record.
Yes, yes!

599
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:02,216
Do I have to...?

600
00:42:06,015 --> 00:42:08,454
Do I have to say it again?

601
00:42:10,734 --> 00:42:15,093
Picture yourself at Ellis Island.
All right? How does that sound?

602
00:42:19,492 --> 00:42:21,332
{y:i}It's me. Leave a message.

603
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,091
{y:i}Christopher? It's Mommy.

604
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,371
{y:i}I know you're there. Pick it up.

605
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:30,010
{y:i}Are you all right?
{y:i}I'm worried about you.

606
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:34,729
{y:i}My God, they mentioned your name
in the newspaper. The Star-Ledger.

607
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,768
{y:i}Mrs. Jones told me.
{y:i}With all those scumbags!

608
00:42:39,448 --> 00:42:42,248
It's been a while
since we met for therapy.

609
00:42:44,727 --> 00:42:47,486
Jason, how's Bard?

610
00:42:50,126 --> 00:42:53,565
I'm moving into a smoke-free dorm.

611
00:42:56,165 --> 00:42:58,124
And how do we feel about that?

612
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:00,764
I'm interested
in discussing what we mentioned.

613
00:43:01,084 --> 00:43:04,843
Jason, are you concerned that your
mother is treating this patient X?

614
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,322
I don't care.

615
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:13,481
As a colleague, Jen,
I suggest you drop the patient.

616
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:15,481
After her last encounter...

617
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:17,041
...she finally acknowledged...

618
00:43:17,281 --> 00:43:20,480
...that she saw the different side
of him, the subhuman.

619
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,519
I take it you were frightened.

620
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,319
Frightened, revolted.

621
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,358
At last, appropriate emotions.

622
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:29,878
Oh, for chrissake, Richard.
You too, Sam.

623
00:43:30,278 --> 00:43:33,037
When did we become afraid
to get our hands dirty?

624
00:43:33,157 --> 00:43:34,757
It's what she gets paid for.

625
00:43:34,957 --> 00:43:37,636
Jason, how would you like
to see your mother...?

626
00:43:39,276 --> 00:43:43,235
Never mind, I'm not gonna paint
any graphic images.

627
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:46,115
See? He always does that.

628
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:47,394
What?

629
00:43:47,514 --> 00:43:50,634
Follow that up, Jase. Dad does what?

630
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:53,473
His issue is that I should
distance myself from this man...

631
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,273
...on the grounds of the stigma
that he brings us.

632
00:43:57,273 --> 00:44:00,072
I say refer this patient
to a therapist...

633
00:44:00,312 --> 00:44:04,231
...that specializes
in Mafia depression.

634
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:08,670
This isn't funny.

635
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,630
No, of course not.

636
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:17,269
Jen has a real honest to goodness
personal and professional dilemma.

637
00:44:20,468 --> 00:44:24,507
You know, on my mother's side,
we have a few dark sheep.

638
00:44:24,867 --> 00:44:26,027
Excuse me?

639
00:44:27,946 --> 00:44:28,786
Lepke.

640
00:44:33,785 --> 00:44:34,905
Who's Lepke?

641
00:44:35,825 --> 00:44:38,224
Louis Lepke Buchalter.

642
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,144
You know. Murder, Incorporated.

643
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:46,783
My mother's uncle
was Lepke's wheelman.

644
00:44:47,063 --> 00:44:48,622
His driver.

645
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:55,021
Those were some tough Jews.

646
