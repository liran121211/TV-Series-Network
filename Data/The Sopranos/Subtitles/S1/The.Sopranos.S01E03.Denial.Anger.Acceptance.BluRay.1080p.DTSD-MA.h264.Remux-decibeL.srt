1
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,858
You should've rang the doorbell, Brendan.

2
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,403
Hey, you! Yeah, you!
What are you doing?

3
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,697
We found this truck
on the side of the road.

4
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,242
There might be transmission trouble.
You should check it out.

5
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,870
What's going on?
Hey, that's the truck.

6
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,039
The one that was stolen in Newark?

7
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,999
What are you doing with the truck?

8
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,712
It's a gift from Tony Soprano.

9
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,885
Let's call the cops.
Those guys killed Hector.

10
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,889
I don't believe it. We just returned
the biggest score of my year.

11
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,682
Listen, you fuck.

12
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,144
Uncle Junior's breaking Tony's balls
since you hijacked that truck.

13
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,230
You're lucky Tony doesn't
shove the cab up your ass.

14
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,652
What else did Comley say?

15
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,112
Nothing much.

16
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,865
There was stuff missing from the truck...

17
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,160
...but he didn't give a fuck
as long as the thing's back.

18
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,456
Then he said to tell Tony thanks,
and if Tony needs anything, to call.

19
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,124
Tony?

20
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,127
Those junkie fucks work for Tony.

21
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,547
They hijack Comley's truck,
I get it back, and he thanks Tony?

22
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:58,095
Well, I think you should've taken care
of this Christopher Moltisanti thing...

23
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,597
...the minute it first happened.

24
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,351
You should've sent a clear signal:
"You fuck with Junior Soprano... "

25
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,938
Take it easy.
We're not making a Western here.

26
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,361
Fucking family.

27
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,948
I bought his kid a $400
surfboard for his birthday.

28
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,434
Mr. Soprano?

29
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,310
How you doing?

30
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,485
Is that a trick picture out there?

31
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,238
Which?

32
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,656
The barn.

33
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,410
And the old tree all rotted out inside.

34
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,747
It's just a picture I bought.

35
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,000
I remember, in a little gallery
in Provincetown.

36
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,420
That is a special-made
psychological picture.

37
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,339
Like that what-do-you-call-it test.

38
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,051
The Korschach.

39
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,345
You think I want to trick you?

40
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,848
- Oh, no.
- What does that picture say?

41
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,559
"We're from Harvard,
and what do you think of...

42
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,021
...this depressing barn and
this rotted-out tree here?"

43
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,356
It's depressing and scary to you?

44
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,066
Not to me.

45
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,069
But it's got that built right into it.

46
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,864
How are things?

47
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,365
Good.

48
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,076
I had a real good week.

49
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,497
A friend's in the hospital.

50
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,707
That's never pleasant, but...

51
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,543
Otherwise, I'm having a good week.

52
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,213
- What's he in for?
- They thought it was an ulcer.

53
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,298
You know, then this, then that.

54
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,509
- You're worried about him?
- Jackie?

55
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,054
Jackie's so fucking mean,
he'll scare that cancer away.

56
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,097
Your friend has cancer?

57
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,313
Jackie, when they hook you up,
do you make sure they don't have...

58
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,899
...air in your veins,
or is that just bullshit?

59
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,234
What do you mean?

60
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:21,905
This is a good hospital, sweetheart.
Nothing like that's gonna happen here.

61
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,408
Air in the line'll kill you.
You know who else...?

62
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,746
You know who else has cancer?

63
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,082
Tommy DiPalma.

64
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,418
He's got it much worse.
It's eating his brain away.

65
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,004
Hey, somebody having a baby or what?

66
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,632
- How you doing?
- All right.

67
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,509
- How you feeling?
- Good.

68
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,011
Hesh, how you doing?
Good to see you.

69
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,888
Thanks for coming.

70
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,099
Jackie, looking well, pal.

71
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,642
Here, Ro, for you.

72
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,561
You're beautiful.

73
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,439
Mikey, nice to see you
again in men's clothing.

74
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,650
I should grab a fire extinguisher.

75
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:03,321
I heard your friend had a spontaneous
combustion in his restaurant.

76
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,032
I'm going to the cafeteria.
Want anything?

77
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,576
A plate of <i>braciole</i>.

78
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,163
- They got grappa in this thing?
- Oh, I wish.

79
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,916
See you later. I got some errands.

80
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,711
- Give Junior my love.
- I will.

81
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:23,800
Tell my uncle I sent back the truck.
Give me the vinegar peppers he owes me.

82
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,723
Thank God he left.

83
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,642
He's a nice guy, but he's
like the Grim Reaper.

84
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,521
He knows every guy with cancer,
and he can't wait to tell you.

85
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,150
Jackie, you might be
a candidate for clinical trials.

86
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,527
These stem cell therapies...

87
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,156
Paulie, he don't want to hear
no more cancer talk.

88
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,074
Get the fuck out of here!

89
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:53,163
Trust me, you caught a break being Jewish.
See what I gotta deal with?

90
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,166
Jews, that's right.
I knew there was something.

91
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,084
Tony, you know Teittleman?

92
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,713
Owns property. Owns the motel
down the street from the club.

93
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,175
The Jew with the black
clothes and the curls.

94
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,927
They're called Hasidim.

95
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,803
"Hasidim" but I don't believe them.

96
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,933
- What does Teittleman want?
- A divorce for his daughter.

97
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,392
What do you mean?

98
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:18,021
His son-in-law will not give
his daughter the consent...

99
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,399
...unless Teittleman gives him
50 percent of his motel.

100
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,485
They call it a <i>get</i>.

101
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,403
Why don't he just...?

102
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,448
It's taboo for their religion.

103
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,033
You know about this shit?

104
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,371
Run. Trust me. You don't want
to do business with these people.

105
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,958
He said there's 25 large in it
if we can get him this <i>get</i>.

106
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,459
There's a saying amongst Jews:

107
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,754
"When a Jew gets a divorce,
even the altar sheds tears."

108
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,839
All right, I heard enough.

109
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,717
Look, I'm getting kind of tired.

110
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,762
Let's go get a cup of coffee.

111
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,473
See you later, Jackie. Take care.

112
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,059
- Take care.
- All right, Jackie.

113
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,877
That crash was Meadow Soprano
jumping her cue.

114
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:27,632
Miss Marris, we're exhausted from
studying for SATs. We were up past 2.

115
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,884
- Are you her lawyer?
- No.

116
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,512
Why they'd schedule SATs
the same week as our recital...

117
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,681
- Same day.
- What?

118
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,271
If we're kicked out of Concert Singers,
we lose our best extracurricular.

119
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,107
Goodbye, Berkeley.
Hello, Glassboro State.

120
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:49,279
I cannot wait until all of North America
is between me and Tony and Carmela.

121
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,780
New Jersey blows.

122
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,116
I want to go to Berkeley so bad.

123
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,452
The whole East, I can't deal anymore.

124
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,079
So we don't sleep till after the SATs.

125
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,957
Don't mind the mess.
I wasn't expecting company.

126
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,293
I couldn't wait.
I had to see the new house.

127
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,379
- Where's King Arthur?
- Downstairs. This plumbing!

128
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,089
- Here?
- Yeah.

129
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,094
Oh, I love the coziness.

130
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,972
Welcome to the neighborhood.

131
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,933
Well, the school district, anyway.

132
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,811
Carm, you did not have to do this.

133
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,732
I mean, we don't see
each other like we used to...

134
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,109
I want that to change.

135
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,157
- Could this be Artie Bucco?
- Hey, <i>capitano</i>!

136
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,825
The place looks good.

137
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,578
It needs a little work,
but we'll get there.

138
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:42,582
You need some cash until the insurance
on the restaurant comes...

139
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:47,337
Insurance. There'll be an Italian president
before I see any insurance money.

140
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,172
I thought that was settled.

141
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,717
Join the club. They're doing
a second arson investigation.

142
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,470
They think you're mobbed up?
You're a working stiff.

143
00:09:55,678 --> 00:10:00,642
It doesn't make any sense. Who would
burn down a perfectly good restaurant?

144
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,894
It's stupid.

145
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,188
Insane.

146
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,194
- Sorry, Artie.
- Life goes on, no?

147
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,363
I could always be a plumber, no?

148
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,865
Only one concept to master:
Shit runs downhill.

149
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:20,120
Yes, it does. Come in the kitchen.
I'll buy you a beer.

150
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,425
- Mr. Soprano.
- Mr. Teittleman.

151
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,344
- My pleasure.
- Have a seat.

152
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,763
- Thank you.
- Silvio you know.

153
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,515
Paulie.

154
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,058
How are you?

155
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,060
This is my son.

156
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,438
Does he have a name?

157
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,732
Oh, I'm sorry. It's Hillel.

158
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,946
You know about my daughter
and her husband?

159
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,447
Yeah, he knows.

160
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,408
Do you have a daughter, Mr. Soprano?

161
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,452
Yes. Call me Tony.

162
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,873
What would you do if she was
abused by her husband?

163
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,166
Talk to him.

164
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,251
Yeah, in ball-peen hammer.

165
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,170
I think you understand my anger.

166
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,465
He's harming my daughter,
and he's mocking our laws of marriage.

167
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,261
Look, let's understand each other
from the get-go here, okay?

168
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,096
I'm in waste management.

169
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:24,267
I'm only here because I'm Silvio's
friend, you're Silvio's friend.

170
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,270
You may be having a problem
I can help you with.

171
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,772
If I can do it, that will make me happy.

172
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,775
What's your problem, Hil?

173
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,997
- Please finish.
- You're being shaken down...

174
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,625
- ...for 50 percent of your motel.
- Correct.

175
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,004
The goon squads who smacked these
husbands around to get the divorce...

176
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,089
...were put out of business by the D.A.

177
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,303
All right, 25 percent.
He wants 50, we get 25.

178
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,013
I don't understand.

179
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm not talking to you.

180
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:18,112
You get me what I want, Mr. Soprano,
and you have a deal.

181
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,489
It's done.

182
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,118
You let them in our motel,
you'll never get them out.

183
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,330
That's a commercial, isn't it?

184
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,299
Julio, before lunch I want you
to do bedding inventory.

185
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,344
Half-hour, and no <i>cervezas</i>, please.

186
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,517
Yes, may I help you?

187
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,936
That depends. Are you Ariel?

188
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,939
That also depends.
Are you a bill collector?

189
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,150
What is this, the Catskills?
Shecky Greene we got here.

190
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,152
Let's talk about your father-in-law.

191
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,946
I'm sorry. He's not here.

192
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,156
We know he's not here.

193
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,703
But we want to talk to you
about him and you. And him.

194
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,913
This problem that you're having.

195
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,040
Look, I don't know who you are...

196
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:15,795
...but any problem I may be having
with my family is none of your matter.

197
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,338
So get out of here.

198
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,758
No, no, look.
Shlomo is a friend of mine.

199
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,510
And you're bragging this?

200
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,929
This guy...

201
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,349
You couldn't possibly understand
what's going on here.

202
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,729
Shlomo is an arrogant,
ignorant control freak.

203
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:37,233
Look, I know him since before I had
hair on my <i>pitzl</i>. I made this place.

204
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,237
The flyers, the car rental drop-off,
the business breakfast.

205
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,197
It was me, not him.

206
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,534
So I sweated blood into this
place, and he owes me.

207
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,078
And I intend to get what's mine.

208
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:53,207
So please, don't embarrass
yourself any further. Just leave.

209
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,169
I'm not embarrassed. You embarrassed?

210
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,088
Listen to me, you weirdo fuck.

211
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,301
You give Shlomo whatever he wants
and you forget this 50 percent shit.

212
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,596
You got nothing coming to you.
Understand me? Nothing!

213
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,056
Fuck you!

214
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,850
Say <i>bupkes</i>, Paulie.

215
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,810
That's how they say "nothing."

216
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,814
Fuck that. This is how I say "nothing."

217
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,525
How's that for nothing?

218
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,365
- You know what?
- Probably not.

219
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,450
The fundraiser for Pediatric Hospital?

220
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,995
I'm gonna hire Artie and
Charmaine to cater it.

221
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,084
Since when do we open
our house to strangers?

222
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,212
Oh, you're right.
Let's just move back to Italy.

223
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,466
We'll live in a hill town like our
ancestors, put a wall around it...

224
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:47,303
...and throw burning oil on all
travelers that knock at the gate.

225
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,972
Come on!

226
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:57,146
Poor Charmaine. I tried to find nice
things to say about that house.

227
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,733
Ain't that bad. Just needs
a little work, that's all.

228
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,278
Those two are so broke. And that fire.

229
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,407
If that insurance would get off its ass.

230
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,159
- Could it have been arson?
- What's the matter with you?

231
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,087
I can't believe you guys
didn't get enough for us.

232
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,298
Yeah, put Matt on.

233
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,842
Hold on.

234
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,845
What's going on? You trying
to damage your inner ears?

235
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,304
We're studying.

236
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,015
These are practice tests
and they're brutal.

237
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,351
Your parents know you're
here, <i>cacciatore</i>?

238
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,687
- They don't care.
- She's sleeping over.

239
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,067
Can Hunter please sleep over?

240
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,903
Start sleeping, then. Study time's over.

241
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,197
We still have six more chapters left.

242
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:54,162
Then can you keep the decibel level
down, please? For my husband.

243
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,042
Matt, I'm serious, you guys.

244
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,712
If we can't score some
crystal, we're dead.

245
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,674
With this budget, we can do three
waiters for the hors d'oeuvres...

246
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,384
...two for the champagne.

247
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,555
It's such a load off. This party
has me at sixes and sevens.

248
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,808
Pediatric Hospital's such a worthy cause.

249
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,059
Oona!

250
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:24,025
There's fingerprints on the breakfront.
I want this place to sparkle.

251
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,405
She's usually very good. From Poland.

252
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,409
<i>Please get in the car, sir.</i>

253
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:38,498
Like the cop would be calling him
"sir" if the cameras weren't around.

254
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,416
I saw this one.

255
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,711
Then call Tony so he can call Junior...

256
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,671
...and see if we can change the channel.

257
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,590
Get that, will you, babe?

258
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,259
Sure. I'm the only one
who has to go to work.

259
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,054
Yeah, restaurant hostess.
Real tough work.

260
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,931
It's your little cousin.

261
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,850
- What's up?
- How are you?

262
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,353
- What are you doing here?
- Hello to you too.

263
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,063
Hunter, what are you doing?

264
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,774
Don't mind him. His brain is fried.

265
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,526
You want a soda or something?

266
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,903
- How about a beer?
- Yeah, right.

267
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,281
Just kidding. I'll have
a Coke if you have one.

268
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,783
What do you want, Meadow?

269
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,826
She wants something from me.

270
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,620
In your dreams, Brendan.

271
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,248
So what do you want?

272
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,418
I wanna cop.

273
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,130
Here you go.

274
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,675
What do you mean, "cop"?

275
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,261
Score. We want to score some crystal.

276
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,470
You got money?

277
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,973
- You ain't giving them shit.
- Why not?

278
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,892
Your father'll put a bullet in my head.

279
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,895
Since when do you take speed, anyway?

280
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,147
She doesn't. I need it to study.

281
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,401
Yeah, right. Hunter needs it.

282
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,070
Forget about it. No fucking way.

283
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,991
What?

284
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,909
He just craves attention.

285
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,665
Just thought I'd ask you before
we went to Jefferson Avenue.

286
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:06,544
Those <i>melanzane</i> will rob you,
rape you and leave you on the road.

287
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,089
What do you see in him?

288
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,925
Money. What do you think?

289
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,343
Fuck you.

290
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,887
- See you, Christopher.
- I got my own money.

291
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,932
What about me?
Nobody's gonna say goodbye to me?

292
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,853
Bye.

293
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,689
Bye, guys.

294
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,988
You can't let her go to Jefferson Avenue.
They'll sell her Ajax.

295
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,700
She won't go there. She just wants
me to give her some speed.

296
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,537
Isn't it better if she gets it from
you with all that poison around?

297
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,334
Kids. You think you can protect them.

298
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,544
But you can't.

299
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:53,090
<i>As the rainy season approaches,
chicks alter their eating habits.</i>

300
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,718
Are you watching that nature shit again?

301
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,219
What are you doing here?

302
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,930
My kid stepped on a nail.
I had to get him a shot.

303
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,599
Yeah, where is he?

304
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,225
At the ER with Carmela.

305
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,395
So whatever happened
with the Jew at the motel?

306
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,231
They reached out to him,
he wasn't receptive.

307
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,150
They're going back.

308
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,407
- Want me to leave?
- Just looking for my nurse's pen.

309
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,911
You got the wrong room
because you are not my nurse.

310
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,913
I know, but I made up the bed.

311
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,416
No, sweetheart. I have not
been out of this bed all day.

312
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,171
- Sorry, I need to check some vitals...
- What are you doing?

313
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,131
That seems to be working fine.

314
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,301
Nobody sends flower
arrangements like New York.

315
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,303
Let me just check his...

316
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,017
This damn IV.

317
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:46,977
Damn!

318
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,771
I got it.

319
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:58,114
I seem to be having a problem.
Do you mind if I borrow one of your gowns?

320
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,283
It's okay. It's a private party.

321
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:06,414
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Have a nice night.

322
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,873
Oh, <i>Madonna</i>!

323
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:21,137
I got you, you prick!
You should've seen your face!

324
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,098
- You prick!
- "I haven't been out of bed all day."

325
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,518
- Look at your face.
- Who the hell is this?

326
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,149
Relax, Mr. Aprile.
It's time for your sponge bath.

327
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,490
She's a friend of mine
from the club. Nice girl.

328
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,911
I joined them later on.
We got a little booze.

329
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,709
You were nice to have
a party for your friend.

330
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,302
"Tufts Medical School."

331
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,558
You're a doctor.

332
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,061
What do you think? About Jackie?

333
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,023
I'd have to know more
about his condition.

334
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,776
I told you about his condition.
He's got cancer.

335
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,402
What kind of cancer?

336
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,070
It's in the intestines.

337
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,241
There was a tumor and they took it out.

338
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,827
And it's recurred.

339
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,080
But you said he might go home.
They're not operating?

340
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,417
It's next to something vital.

341
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,878
- I see.
- You see?

342
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,130
From what you're saying,
it doesn't sound good.

343
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,924
From what I'm telling you?

344
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,218
What do I know? I'm not a doctor.

345
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,595
- You're angry. Who with?
- I'll tell you.

346
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,641
This man has had chemo
every day for three weeks.

347
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,227
He still has every last hair on his head.

348
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:55,231
Every last hair on his head,
and he's got a beautiful head of hair.

349
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,234
So don't tell me how it sounds.
You don't know him or me...

350
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,069
...or what you're talking about.

351
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,572
We're getting closer to you
confronting your true feelings...

352
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,574
...about what's really going on.

353
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,452
Wait a minute.
I just told you my true feelings.

354
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,579
You tell me what's really going on.

355
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,582
The tree in the painting
rotted out, you said.

356
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,751
Nothing indicates that.

357
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,254
I knew that was a fucking scam.

358
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:21,257
I knew that painting was a fucking scam!

359
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,593
You remember your dream?
The ducks?

360
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,179
It took on another meaning.

361
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,683
What happens to a tree that's rotted out?

362
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,227
Trees, ducks. What are you, Ranger Rick?

363
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,647
Some job you shrinks got.
You think everybody's lying...

364
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:40,609
...while you're pulling scams
on them! Fuck you!

365
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,700
There's 37 definites.
We got another 13 maybes...

366
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,619
...plus the whole Pediatric Hospital Board.

367
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,454
Right.

368
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,207
Are you sure we ordered
enough champagne?

369
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,459
Right.

370
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,880
Gene says they shouldn't be
too sober for the auction.

371
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,425
If anyone ever finds out
you got this from me...

372
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,511
Look at me. This is no joke.

373
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,098
We don't always get along,
but you don't want to see me dead.

374
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,225
I gotta call Hunter. You're the best.

375
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:17,605
Hey, I'm serious. Just this once, okay?
I'm no drug dealer.

376
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:21,442
I don't want to see you get poisoned.
Your father ever finds out...

377
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,819
God, doesn't anyone ever knock?

378
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,615
Tell Brendan that Hunter would
rather die than go out with him.

379
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,241
Brendan?

380
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:32,494
Christopher, keep that asshole
away from that child.

381
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,080
He asked me to do him a favor, I did it.

382
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,834
All right, you delivered the message.
Now let Meadow study.

383
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,050
Two <i>goombahs</i> from the old neighborhood.

384
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:50,763
What, they think they're gonna name it
the Soprano Wing in the new hospital?

385
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,515
I think you're just
jealous of their money.

386
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,184
- Me?
- Yeah.

387
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,227
Okay, but explain to me this.

388
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,606
He offers us two tickets to the
Caribbean out of friendship.

389
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,441
You say no, they're tainted.

390
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,819
But for some party, I take
his money to clean his toilets.

391
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:10,199
First of all, Arthur, this is a paying
job and not some cruise.

392
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,826
And why do you always have to exaggerate?

393
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,037
You're not cleaning his toilets.
You're a chef.

394
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,833
Good. So you don't mind that he
fronts me money for a new place...

395
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,627
...because he offered.

396
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,797
Look at that face.

397
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,842
Oh, God, don't tell me that you
took money from Tony Soprano.

398
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:33,222
How is it different? I'm a chef.
I need a place to cook.

399
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,392
How? I'm giving Carmela
my support, that's how.

400
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,811
And it's for a very reputable cause.

401
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:43,148
But to have that man as a partner,
trust me, that would be insane.

402
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,234
It'd mean the end of everything.

403
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,944
At least he made the gesture.

404
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,990
Name me another person who offered
us anything except the Sopranos?

405
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,576
Watch what you're doing.
You're squeezing the quail.

406
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,836
Should we turn on the air?

407
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,296
It's going okay.
Do you like the food?

408
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,425
I was so busy schmoozing,
I barely had a bite.

409
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,219
Don't miss those little veal <i>tonnatos</i>.

410
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,846
Charmaine!

411
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:27,026
Not in the car! Please!
Not in the car!

412
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,944
Shut up! Shut up!

413
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,363
Shut up and get in the fucking car!

414
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,210
I can't get used to
strangers in my house.

415
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:46,545
Why'd you invite them?

416
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,051
Try one of these.

417
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,806
You're a fucking great cook.

418
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,392
I cook like this...

419
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,604
...it reminds me of what I lost.

420
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:08,901
To have my restaurant ripped
from me. I can't tell you...

421
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,819
It was like losing a limb.

422
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,241
- Sometimes I lay in bed...
- Enough already.

423
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,911
Forget about the past.
Look to the future.

424
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:23,332
I'm sick of hearing of your restaurant.
Shut up, you depressing jerk!

425
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,626
What the fuck do you know about it?

426
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,505
You motherfucker.

427
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,515
You fucking jerk!

428
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,184
Come on. Give it up.

429
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,982
See what you get when you...

430
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,945
Fucking son of a bitch!

431
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,199
- Get up, you stubborn fuck.
- Please!

432
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:01,036
Too late. All this because you
won't say yes to a divorce?

433
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,371
It's not that simple!

434
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:06,542
Why not? You sign your fucking
name to a piece of paper!

435
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,210
I don't like you.

436
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,296
Well, I don't like you.
You believe this prick?

437
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:15,509
What do I get, huh?
You work for nothing? I don't think so!

438
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,886
I say we force-feed him his sombrero.

439
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,223
She wants to go to Israel,
I send her. I pay.

440
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,393
I feed her, I clothe her,
I put a roof over her head.

441
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,729
I worked for her father for 20
years and took his abuse.

442
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,231
So I get nothing?

443
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,233
- Stand up!
- We don't care.

444
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,652
Tough fucking luck, ain't it, pal?

445
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,572
You mother...!

446
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:38,866
Silvio!

447
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,248
Motherfucker.

448
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,375
This guy's a bull.

449
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,588
Paulie, if we don't kill this prick...

450
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,882
...we should put him to work.

451
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,222
Time's a-wasting.

452
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,642
I was lucky I could get out
at all with that party tonight.

453
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,565
Shit!

454
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,991
- Hello.
- <i>Tony.</i>

455
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:24,661
Sorry to bother you.
This isn't working out how we hoped.

456
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,456
<i>With our friend with the funny sideburns.</i>

457
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,791
Don't say no more on the phone.

458
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,794
I'm coming down.

459
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,130
Shit!

460
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,507
I gotta go.

461
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,136
You just got here.

462
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,639
Yeah, I know, but I gotta go.

463
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,654
What's that painting mean to you?

464
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:04,076
Nothing. It just reminds
me of David Hockey.

465
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,180
You want something to munch on?

466
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,849
Are you kidding me?

467
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,436
Most guys I know would be
happy to get rid of their wife.

468
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,106
I tried explaining the realities here.

469
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:37,025
This guy's as stubborn as a fucking mule.

470
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,111
He says it's principle.

471
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:43,365
I think we gotta... you know.
That's why we called you.

472
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,575
I promised the father-in-law I wouldn't.

473
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,411
I don't know what else to do.

474
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,835
You're a stupid fucker, you know that?

475
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,837
I've heard it said.

476
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,922
What are you, proud of it?

477
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:04,052
You kill me and a dark cloud
goes over Shlomo's house.

478
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:08,056
Either way, they'll be no <i>get</i>
unless restitution is made.

479
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,185
You really would let me
kill you, you sick fuck.

480
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,398
You ever heard of the Masada?

481
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:21,611
For two years, 900 Jews held their own...

482
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,906
...against 15,000 Roman soldiers.

483
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,036
They chose death before enslavement.

484
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:32,664
And the Romans, where are they now?

485
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,168
You're looking at them, asshole.

486
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:44,426
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

487
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,387
...I fear no evil for Thou art with me.

488
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,431
Yeah, hold that thought.

489
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,028
- Yeah.
- Hesh.

490
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,656
I'm with my non-shellfish-eating
friend, and I'm tapped out.

491
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,825
This guy won't listen to reason.

492
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:11,995
Didn't I tell you, huh?

493
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,289
I warned you to keep away from them.

494
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,999
He left me no options.

495
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,627
He's willing to go down with the ship.

496
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,214
Here's a thought.

497
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,883
Maybe he's willing to go
to the world to come...

498
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,135
...but if he's stuck here on this earth...

499
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:31,139
...I know one thing that no man
wants to go through life without.

500
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,641
What?

501
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,771
That's a brilliant idea.

502
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,524
Make like a <i>mohel</i>, huh?

503
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,150
Finish his <i>bris</i>.

504
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,652
Yeah.

505
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,157
Paulie, get the ball cutters
from out of the truck.

506
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,160
Ariel, we're going to plan B.

507
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,746
The phone has been ringing all morning.

508
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,999
The Rotellis, the Trillos.
He has to do with computers.

509
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,002
They're wonderful.
She invited us to brunch.

510
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,338
- Really?
- Yep.

511
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,384
But it was the food, Mainie.
Everybody raved about it.

512
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:12,556
Cynthia said, "I love those rice balls,"
like she never had <i>arancini</i> before.

513
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:17,060
Really, Mainie, I couldn't
have done it without you.

514
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,521
It meant so much to me,
having you here.

515
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,149
It just made it so much fun for me.

516
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,111
Mainie, is something wrong?
You got something on your mind?

517
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,696
What could be wrong?

518
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,740
Listen, sweetie.

519
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:35,704
It may not seem like it right now,
but you'll get back on your feet again.

520
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,874
Carmela, I'm fine where I am.

521
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,085
I know. That's not what I meant.

522
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,505
Carmela, I never wanted to tell you this.

523
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:50,135
It happened so long ago.
You and Tony weren't even married.

524
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:53,597
It's probably silly for me
to even bring it up now.

525
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,140
What?

526
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,644
You were at the shore with your parents.

527
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,397
You and Tony were on the outs.
He called me.

528
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,732
He did?

529
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,569
One thing led to another,
we started dating each other and...

530
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,988
Carmela, I slept with him.

531
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,617
You slept with Tony?

532
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:17,162
Really, it wasn't for me.

533
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:21,791
Carmela, what I'm trying to say is,
stop worrying about me.

534
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:26,755
Really. I mean, we both made
our choices. I'm fine with mine.

535
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,859
I'd like for you to consider this.

536
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,152
Don't give me that.

537
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,446
What's going on? Why'd you page me?

538
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,282
This guy's trying to pull some bullshit.

539
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:57,285
Hey, ZZ Top. The guy gave you
the <i>get</i>, didn't he?

540
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:01,456
But not because of you.
You threatened him with castration.

541
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:06,628
It was business that brought him around.
He wanted 50%, you wanted 25%.

542
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,381
So I split the difference.
I gave him 15 percent...

543
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:12,300
...he gives my daughter the divorce...

544
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:16,054
- It's business. It worked out.
- You gotta walk with me, Shlomo.

545
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,139
Listen, don't worry.

546
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,476
I'm taking good care of you here.

547
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:22,727
What's that?

548
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:26,481
For your considerable trouble.
As the Talmud says...

549
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,068
I don't give a shit what he says, okay?

550
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,613
You want to give your son-in-law
15 percent of the motel?

551
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,324
You go ahead.
It comes out of your end.

552
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:40,829
Now, we got you your <i>get</i>.
You get us our 25 percent. Got it?

553
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,622
My son was right.

554
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,875
You're mud. Godless clay!

555
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,879
I created a living <i>golem</i>!

556
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,548
What the fuck is a <i>golem</i>?

557
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,842
It's a monster! Frankenstein!

558
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,677
- Get out of here...
- Living dead!

559
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,222
...before I take your asshole son
and shove him up your ass!

560
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,974
Shut up!

561
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,653
Hey.

562
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,948
Hey, how you doing?

563
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,242
One second.

564
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,541
I got some good news. We're in the
motel business. How do you like that?

565
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,507
Read this.

566
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,305
102.7.

567
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,726
They should take my temperature
with the other machine.

568
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,479
Paulie broke his hand on the guy's head.

569
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,731
- Digital.
- We're waling on this guy.

570
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,734
- I'm gonna cut his dick off.
- I'll call the nurse.

571
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:56,071
He's mumbling and praying.
I'm getting his pants off.

572
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,323
They should take my temperature again.

573
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,784
Yeah, yeah, call them.

574
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,763
Poor Jackie.

575
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,267
God has his reasons.

576
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,312
Livia, he looked twice as old as me.

577
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,357
So what's really on your mind, Corrado?

578
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,235
This Christopher Moltisanti.

579
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:38,029
Christopher? What about him?

580
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,949
Him and his little friend.

581
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:45,120
They're slapping me in the face,
and they're hiding behind Tony.

582
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:49,165
Well, Tony always loved
Christopher like a son.

583
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,793
And so do I, Junior.

584
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,046
He put up my storm windows for me
one year.

585
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,717
Good.

586
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,808
But what do I do?

587
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,562
I just let him and this Filone
kid piss on me in public?

588
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,232
And how far do I go before
I light a frigging match...

589
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,026
...under that hotheaded son of yours?

590
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,532
Maybe Christopher could
use a little talking to.

591
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,159
You know.

592
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,661
The other one...

593
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,164
...Filone?

594
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,837
I don't know.

595
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,512
You got a lot of sense for an old gal.

596
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,266
No, I'm a babbling idiot.

597
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,687
That's why my son put me
in a nursing home.

598
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,775
He didn't even care I was there.

599
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,279
It was just him and that fucking cancer.

600
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,327
It's like he's already gone.

601
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,621
Yes.

602
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,090
Somebody called me a Frankenstein today.

603
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,425
Really?

604
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:26,012
This Hasid I'm doing business with.

605
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,724
These Hasids, I mean,
they're out there...

606
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,727
...but they got their beliefs, you know?

607
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,565
They're not afraid of death.
This one guy wasn't.

608
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:41,110
Maybe they have the belief
because they are afraid.

609
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,946
I'm not afraid of death.

610
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,617
Not if it's for something.

611
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,912
You know? A war, something like that.

612
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,456
A reason.

613
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,041
But Jackie...

614
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,419
To see this strong...

615
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,922
...beautiful man...

616
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,260
...just wither away to nothing...

617
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,558
And you can't do nothing about it.

618
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,937
You can't fight it.

619
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,649
You envy the Hasids and their beliefs?

620
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,901
All this shit's for nothing?

621
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,199
If it's for nothing,
why must I think about it?

622
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,660
That's the mystery, isn't it?

623
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:36,291
The mystery of God,
or whatever you want to call it...

624
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,794
...and why we're given
the questionable gift...

625
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,463
...of knowing that we're gonna die.

626
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,141
Do you feel like Frankenstein?

627
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,271
A thing?

628
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,149
Lacking humanity?

629
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,110
Lacking human feelings?

630
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,854
Thank you. That's for you.

631
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,315
Say hello to Freddy, all right?

632
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,135
Let me go!

633
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:12,679
Let me go!

634
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,141
You're friends of Tony's <i>goomar</i>, right?

635
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,560
Meadow wanted the crystal.

636
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:23,147
If I didn't get it to her,
she would've went to Jefferson.

637
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,401
You tell Tony. They would've
beat her and raped her!

638
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,236
I don't want to die now!

639
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,572
I didn't mean it. I am sorry!

640
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,993
Listen to me!
I was trying to save her!

641
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,245
Listen to me! You speak English?

642
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,539
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot!

643
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,766
Fuck!

644
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,912
Hi, Jack. Bye, Jack.
