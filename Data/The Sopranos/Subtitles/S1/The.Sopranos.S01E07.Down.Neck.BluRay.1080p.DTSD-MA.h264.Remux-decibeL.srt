1
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,892
Come on! Come on, dog!
Come on!

2
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,769
Come on! Come on.

3
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,359
Look at this! Look at this plastic!

4
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,278
And there's weeds!

5
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,530
Well, it looks like Tobacco Road.

6
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,325
- Nobody gets down here.
- Anthony!

7
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,202
Those dogs are wild dogs.

8
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,204
Cemetery dogs.

9
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,332
They'll take your hand off.

10
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,336
Come over here.
Say a Hail Mary for your grandfather.

11
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,795
Lay off. He's a kid.

12
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,466
So he should neglect his elders?
Just like his father.

13
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,384
Yeah, a real skimp.

14
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,719
My son.

15
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,555
The mental patient.

16
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:22,476
Remember those trips to the shore?
Me and Tony rode the waves?

17
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,061
I taught him to bodysurf.

18
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:27,022
My son was brought up right.

19
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,650
He needs a psychiatrist for what?

20
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,027
- To talk about his sex life?
- Enough.

21
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,571
I hate it as much as you do.

22
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,575
Those dogs could start
foaming at the mouth.

23
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,287
How come you're not supposed
to breathe in the cemetery?

24
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,082
- Who says?
- It's a joke. Say, "Why?"

25
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,501
You'll make the dead people jealous.

26
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,590
Okay, come pick it up! Pick it up.

27
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,051
Who's got the ball?!

28
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,594
Oh, my God! Look out!

29
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,721
Come around, come around!

30
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,557
Up, up, up! Cover them through!

31
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,017
I can't watch.

32
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:10,190
Way to go, Meadow!
You're a brick wall, baby! Brick wall!

33
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,943
Good save!
Come on, now. Come on!

34
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,028
That was close.

35
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,782
- Pretty good.
- Look at you. At girls' soccer, Tony.

36
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,535
What do you want?
My son's a couch potato.

37
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,162
- Red! Five!
- Are you yellow-card happy?

38
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,581
Rough play, my ass!

39
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,461
- Hi, honey.
- Go get them, baby.

40
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,798
This fat kid is such a sneak
with that elbow!

41
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,468
Coach says next year, Chiara
is gonna be one of his starts.

42
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,595
Let's pull it out, for chrissake!

43
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,557
Heather Dante!
A hundred bucks for a goal!

44
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,310
What's with Ally today?
She's sleepwalking out there.

45
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,815
She eats at our house a lot.
She's got the energy.

46
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,693
That tackle was our ball, asshole!

47
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,611
Zebra, I'm talking to you.

48
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,449
Blow that again,
I'll stick it up your ass!

49
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,828
Get off the field now, or your team
is gonna forfeit the game!

50
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,330
I'm going. You fucking son of a...

51
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,166
Get off the field!

52
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,713
Did a hell of a job.

53
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,843
Falcons! Falcons, heads up!

54
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,180
Red, 42! 42!

55
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,348
Push! Ally!

56
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,059
Come on.

57
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,396
Come on, Al!

58
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,590
Did I tell you? What did I tell you?

59
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,802
He's a brilliant coach.
A beautiful, brilliant genius.

60
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,553
You in love with him?

61
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:08,391
Yes. If he steers Chiara to a college
scholarship, I'll blow the guy.

62
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,101
You will?

63
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,855
How's chefing at Dimples?

64
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:18,652
Try the salad bar. We got a chemical
brightener. It keeps lettuce crisp.

65
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,987
- How nice.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

66
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,324
The offer's still there.
You put some out on the street...

67
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,953
...at two points, we split
the interest. Nice?

68
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,041
I can't do the math. I'm an artiste.

69
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,335
Get out of here.

70
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,672
Good job, girls!

71
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,143
- Absolutely.
- And you do that so well, coach.

72
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,771
- Thanks.
- The psychology is important.

73
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,022
Did a hell of a job.

74
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,401
Welcome to Bada Bing.
Everything's on the house.

75
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,111
Come meet somebody.

76
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,488
- He coached college.
- Get out of here.

77
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,783
- Division 1-A.
- No, that's boonie state.

78
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,954
Besides, it's time to stop moving
my wife and Deena like pawns...

79
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,789
...when someone ups the ante.

80
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:17,002
Anyway, how many chances does a man
get to coach his own daughter?

81
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,546
- Money isn't everything.
- Here, here.

82
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,131
The kids are important.

83
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,718
Cheers. To the Falcons.
Continued success.

84
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:33,518
Brandy, why don't you give the coach
a deluxe tour of the VIP lounge.

85
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,146
- What?
- Oh, guys.

86
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,565
Jesus, we said a beer.

87
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,986
No, I... Thank you, but I don't think so.

88
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,656
Jesus Christ.

89
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,618
Okay, Brandy, go sit on a tuffet.

90
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,204
Coach, it's on the house.

91
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,876
- Why are you here?
- Who's he?

92
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,003
My girl's coach. You got something?

93
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,964
Every car you see in the rear-view
mirror is not a fed.

94
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,967
Mikey Palmice went and got
a major Manhattan Pl.

95
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,180
Mikey thinks someone here rats
for the government. What else is new?

96
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,559
What else? My colleague over
at Organized Crime Task Force...

97
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,521
...gets chatty after caffeine drinks.

98
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,692
Names of people whose fiscal
interests intersect with your own.

99
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,530
I'm still trying to find out
if you've been named.

100
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,743
But these people are keeping these
indictments very, very internal.

101
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,537
They may have a folder
with my name on it.

102
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,539
If I was smart, I wouldn't be here.

103
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:37,791
I rest my case.

104
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,210
I'm up the street on a rape-homicide.

105
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,047
What I need now is to see a liquor
license, if you don't mind.

106
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:48,218
So anybody wonders why I was
here or for the lie detector test...

107
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,554
Cha-cha, show him the liquor license.

108
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,223
Don't touch the girls.

109
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,226
How you doing?

110
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,479
Bada Bing. Arthur Bucco!

111
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,150
Hello?

112
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,736
You gonna stay in that bar all day?

113
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,031
- I'm shooting pool.
- I'll rack them up for you.

114
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,284
<i>I thought we were supposed
to paint the patio.</i>

115
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,537
I bought primer and I've been scraping.

116
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,913
You have?

117
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,332
I could really use your help.

118
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,626
All right. I'll be right home.

119
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,424
This fucking guy lays down the law.

120
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,176
Fucking blistering. "I'll be right home."

121
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,430
I gotta get home too.
Shelley'll be looking for me.

122
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,849
It's quite the lifestyle you got here.

123
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,726
- See ya later, coach.
- Okay.

124
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,186
Different strokes.

125
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,607
Melvoin, Perlov, Schneider and Archide.

126
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,197
- What's going on with the indictments?
- Put it right down there.

127
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,285
The book is off on the 14th ward.

128
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:59,581
I don't want to minimize your position.
Two prior convictions.

129
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,543
You're in jeopardy of sentence under
the habitual offenders statute.

130
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,005
I'm paying you to hear shit
that's eating my insides?

131
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,298
Peppers and eggs?

132
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,426
Peppers and eggs?
That's what I should've had.

133
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,392
"I'd be happy to surrender Mr. Soprano.

134
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,353
You can be assured
of my full cooperation."

135
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,523
You'd rather they kicked in
your front door at night?

136
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,776
It's a target letter, Corrado.

137
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,196
I got nowhere, so I asked
them what your status was.

138
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,241
Just testing. So what'd they say?

139
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,035
They'd let me know.

140
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,329
I may just start paying taxes.

141
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,414
God, it's a fucking burn.

142
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,168
I'm sick and tired of sitting around.
I'm gonna get out of here.

143
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,753
With your lady friend?

144
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,463
What do you know about her?

145
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,216
Works for the Joint Fitters Union, right?

146
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:56,387
Runs their labor management fund
outside the feds' oversight.

147
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,934
If you can't get your friends jobs,
why attain success?

148
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,186
The wheels of justice turn slowly.

149
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,689
Take her to Florida. Develop a tan.

150
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,483
Where's the crapper key?

151
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,485
Top right-hand drawer.

152
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:16,199
Junior, we're working out of a fucking
lawyer's office, is that right?

153
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,787
Look, I didn't want to say anything,
but this government case...

154
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,832
...if there's a leak,
it's in Tony's boat.

155
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,753
If my nephew's in bed with
the Justice Department, just say it.

156
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,755
Don't stammer like a spastic.

157
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,884
There's something fucking wrong
with that guy. I feel it in my gut.

158
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,512
I'm worried about you, skipper.

159
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,390
I'm sorry, Mikey. You're a good boy.

160
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,601
Fuck this. I'm going to Boca.

161
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,772
Deena, when you guys
showed up last year...

162
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,650
...I thought, "Soccer, give me a break."

163
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,612
But your dad makes it seem like this,
I don't know, metaphor.

164
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,447
- Yeah.
- Dad's pretty cool.

165
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,617
Where's Al? She was supposed
to loan me a cig.

166
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,411
I'll come with.

167
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,746
Al?

168
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,081
Ally!

169
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,796
If you're smoking, you owe me $5!

170
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,058
Ally, what are you doing?

171
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,102
Ally! Oh, my God!

172
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,566
<i>Her parents split up.</i>

173
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,110
So she's always at our house.

174
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:38,281
- But she was born with a silver spoon.
- Teenagers are under a lot of stress.

175
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,950
I know this kid. She's great.

176
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,622
Was it a genuine suicide attempt?
Or was it a suicidal gesture?

177
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,292
"Small cutting" is the clinical term.

178
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,628
Is "large cutting" O.J.
in missing sweats?

179
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,671
It's a cry for help.

180
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,303
Her mother says she tried this before.

181
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,388
A couple times.

182
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,142
What else is going on?

183
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,478
Life is putting the Prozac to the test.

184
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,022
It's all that business in the news?

185
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,982
Let's talk about my daughter.

186
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,611
Principal says girls in sports do better.

187
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,280
They don't take drugs or get knocked up.

188
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,366
But now this shit.

189
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,535
If my daughter ever
tried to kill herself...

190
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,874
Oh, God!

191
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,428
Last week, I called you a whore.

192
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,305
I might've been...

193
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,850
...overstating the case a little bit.

194
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,234
Mr. Soprano.

195
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,777
Miss Sanfillipo.

196
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,445
A check for you to sign.

197
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,198
Twenty grand?

198
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,244
For research and development
into furthering the art and science...

199
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,579
...of metal joint fittings.

200
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,041
Where does our research and
development take us this time?

201
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,585
Well, I was thinking Boca Raton.

202
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,421
My, my! You read my mind.

203
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,047
I'm all packed.

204
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,425
I gotta talk to my cousin.

205
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,011
- Mr. Soprano?
- What?

206
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:27,181
I was waiting to talk to Jerry about
how I could use some room...

207
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,600
...on this mall job I got
in North Bergen.

208
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,770
Then I saw you here.
And I thought, what the hell...

209
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,440
...I may as well ask the man himself.

210
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,403
Let's you and I meet. I can pass
my recommends on to my cousin.

211
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,450
Mama Livia, how are you?

212
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,912
- Do you remember me? Larry Boy Barese.
- I know who you are.

213
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,791
You lit an apartment house on fire...

214
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,420
...and scared your mother half to death.

215
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,756
Mama's moving in here on the 15th.

216
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,216
Yeah? Ooh, I like your shoes.

217
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:06,220
Mama hasn't been well. Last week
she threw a jar of artichokes at me.

218
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,973
She better not throw any
artichokes at me.

219
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,018
How are you doing? Remember Larry?

220
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,978
Water under the bridge.

221
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,522
We're gonna take a walk.

222
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,609
You should get some shoes like his.

223
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:24,822
You've always been a fucking genius.
But this last move is the best.

224
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,450
The feds'll never surveil
an old folks' home.

225
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,245
That's why I got truckloads
of bootleg Polident coming in.

226
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,414
- There he is.
- How you doing?

227
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,792
Did you get your mother settled in yet?

228
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:40,088
They're not sure they can accept her.
They want to see my finances again.

229
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:44,258
So this office supply chain from Virginia.
What's the deal on them?

230
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:48,679
I spoke to them. I think they'll
listen to reason on minority hiring.

231
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,975
- Been to any games?
- What do they got?

232
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,154
What the fuck?

233
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,954
Knees high, Colgiavani!

234
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,457
Eyes ahead!
Energy, girls, energy!

235
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,545
I know we're all upset,
but we still have a season left.

236
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,964
- Come on, let's go!
- Hey, coach.

237
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,008
Fellas, sorry, but practice
is closed today.

238
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,177
I'm trying to keep the team focused.

239
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,221
What are you doing?

240
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,016
You're leaving us?
After two fucking years?

241
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:37,770
I told that reporter to wait before
he put that in the paper.

242
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,232
Coach, look at my little girl out there.

243
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,401
You're breaking her heart!

244
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,488
Believe me, Art. I am hugely conflicted.

245
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,032
But Rhode Island doubled my salary!

246
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:54,036
They're giving my daughter a full ride!
What could I do?

247
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,372
They made an offer I couldn't refuse.

248
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,666
- You haven't heard ours.
- Come on.

249
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,751
Look, I got a family too.

250
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,504
I have a daughter who
loves playing soccer.

251
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,381
He's kidding about the offer.

252
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,552
Hey, nobody blew a whistle!

253
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,388
Let's not get lazy out here! Come on!

254
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,432
Go fuck yourself.

255
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,142
Excuse me?

256
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,603
- Want me to tell your dad?
- It's my field.

257
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,941
Give me 10 laps around the goals.

258
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,943
- Whatever.
- Make that 20.

259
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,446
Anybody else want to mouth off?

260
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,784
Good! Come on!
Let's circle up for keep-away.

261
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,411
Let's go! Over here.

262
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,372
Get in a big circle!
Go! Move it!

263
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,835
I need some people out here.
Come on! Let's go!

264
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,266
Give me your glass.

265
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,730
Who'd think we could be this contented?

266
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,692
I did. As soon as I saw you, I knew.

267
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,237
You're a sweetheart.

268
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,157
If only they knew the other side of you.

269
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,409
They'd eat me for breakfast.

270
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,997
I been looking at real estate.
Some nice houses on the market.

271
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,250
Maybe you'd like something bigger?

272
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,170
No, Corrado. This is our place.

273
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,839
You know how long we been coming here?

274
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,176
Sixteen years.
And every one of them good.

275
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,055
How's junior, Junior?

276
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,644
He's catching some shuteye.

277
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,647
You're such a powerhouse.

278
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,650
When you kiss me down there...

279
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,361
...you're like a great artist.

280
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,864
You got a real instinct for it.

281
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,034
Pass me the red peppers.

282
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,132
You know the thrill you give?

283
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,011
Keep it to yourself, okay?

284
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,889
Yeah. All to myself.

285
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,401
- Corrado?
- Yeah?

286
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,528
Why the big secret?

287
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,196
About what?

288
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,699
Oral sex.

289
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,037
What's so terrible about
pleasing a woman?

290
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,206
You always have to talk about it.

291
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,917
Well, I want to know why!

292
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,586
It's complicated.

293
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,756
Yeah. But why?

294
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,758
Why?

295
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,178
They think if you suck pussy,
you'll suck anything.

296
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,596
You're kidding.

297
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,683
It's a sign of weakness. And possibly
a sign that you're a <i>finocchio</i>.

298
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,187
A fag?

299
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,898
That's ridiculous.

300
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,319
How would the two even translate?

301
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,739
What are you gonna do?

302
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,449
I don't make the rules.

303
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,579
It's no big lifestyle choice.

304
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:27,792
My aunts Quintima and Jemma,
they got money out earning on the street.

305
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:31,003
It's like being a banker.
You help people.

306
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,093
Chiara cried when she heard
the coach was leaving.

307
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,844
You don't want to talk. Fine.

308
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,597
I gotta pick up Carmela anyway.

309
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,768
Let me ask you a question:
Why does your wife hate me?

310
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,603
Charmaine doesn't hate you.

311
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,359
You lie like I play a horn.

312
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:54,944
What?

313
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,575
Look at this <i>facchino</i>.
Wearing a cap in a nice restaurant.

314
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,582
I hated that most when I had
my restaurant. It's values today.

315
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,419
Standards are crumbling.

316
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,966
Would it kill this coach to stay
until my kid graduates?

317
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,635
Then let him stay four years for Chiara.

318
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,183
That burns my ass.

319
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,645
Where you going?

320
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,027
Take your hat off.

321
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,404
Excuse me?

322
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,657
They don't sell hot dogs.
They took the bleachers out.

323
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,993
I'll wear it where I want.

324
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,344
How you doing?

325
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,024
Thank you.

326
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,734
Look at him.

327
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,487
Douche bag. Good for you!

328
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,949
Send them a bottle of Montepulciano.

329
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,828
Get the license plate of these
two guys sitting behind Artie.

330
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,039
They look like cops.

331
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,975
Well, look who's here! Hi!

332
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,855
- Tony, look who's here.
- Alphonse, how you doing?

333
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,732
- Good.
- You feeling better?

334
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,442
Yeah.

335
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,239
Gonna miss that left foot of yours.

336
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,741
No. It's okay, Mr. Soprano.

337
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,576
- I'm gonna play.
- No shit?

338
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,411
Pardon my French there.

339
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,038
Are you sure, Ally?

340
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,917
I had a long talk with Coach Hauser and...

341
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,630
I'm gonna play. That's all.

342
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,674
I told her she didn't have to.

343
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,676
She just said she wanted to.

344
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,554
Yeah.

345
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,348
- Coach pressure you?
- No, Mrs. Soprano.

346
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,933
He would never do that.

347
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,894
Pressure her? He doesn't
finish what he started.

348
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,563
- Dad!
- What?

349
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,275
It's what we all wanted.

350
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,988
Okay. Right?

351
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,614
As long as everything's...

352
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:48,367
We're trying to watch this, okay?

353
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,453
Kick ass, girls, right?

354
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,289
Good night.

355
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,063
Listen, Roberta, what I said earlier?

356
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,861
I'm serious, you discuss that with anyone,
we're gonna go 10 rounds.

357
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,822
We just skimmed 20,000
off the development fund...

358
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,825
...and you're worried about
a little <i>lecca fica</i>?

359
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,620
- Will you keep it down?
- All right.

360
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:37,041
I'll tell everyone you're a good kisser.
I just won't say where.

361
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,044
That's my reputation you're playing with.

362
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,672
Honey, my lips are sealed.

363
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,842
Not too sealed, right?

364
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,681
Visual on Corrado Soprano
and female travel companion...

365
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:56,435
...2200 hours, Boca Lounge.

366
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,868
How's my boy today?

367
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,620
Go, go, go!

368
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,625
I'm looking for a Coach Hauser.

369
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,628
That's me. Petey! Come here!

370
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,715
Something from your friends
at the Bada Bing.

371
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:31,387
Brand-new, surround sound,
HDTV compatible.

372
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,473
- Tell them thanks, but...
- This is getting heavy.

373
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:38,143
If this is about Rhode Island,
tell them I already signed.

374
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:42,272
I don't know what it's about.
But the TV stays here. Put it down.

375
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,359
No! I mean it!

376
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,028
Pick it up! Get it off my property!

377
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:51,156
Look, pal, I don't think
you quite understand.

378
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,367
I understand, only too well.

379
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,661
Tell your friends I know all about them.

380
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,205
If you did, you'd do what they want.

381
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,708
Is that a threat?

382
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,419
How things change.
Let me tell you, Guido...

383
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,753
I'm Clarence.

384
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,716
I have friends in law enforcement,
and they'd call this extortion.

385
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,093
Come on.

386
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:18,934
You tell those assholes Don Hauser
will not be intimidated!

387
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,979
I will not be threatened or bribed!

388
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,107
I go where I want to when I want to!

389
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,486
Hey!

390
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,784
All day, every day,
85 and not one drop of rain.

391
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,619
And those nights.

392
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,582
Bobbi, you are so lucky with this guy.
You have no idea.

393
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,959
He's a sweetheart underneath it all.

394
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,795
I wish I could get Lou to be like him.

395
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,339
More sensitive, if you know what I mean.

396
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,966
That coral looks good.

397
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:55,804
I don't understand why I always
have to ask him for oral sex.

398
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,141
Not like you and your Corrado.

399
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,687
Bebe, listen, I know we always
used to yak about our sex lives.

400
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,940
I think it would be better
if we didn't anymore.

401
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,359
- Okay.
- I mean it.

402
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,819
Sure!

403
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,322
Just, you're lucky, that's all.

404
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,663
So, Ma, you coming to the game?

405
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,624
Game? What game?

406
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,418
Meadow's team is going to the sectionals.

407
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,170
Nobody tells me anything.

408
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,839
Did everybody hear me just tell her?

409
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,468
Can anybody think of anything
else to talk about?

410
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,347
All right. Uncle Jun, how was Boca?

411
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,266
Wonderful. I don't go down enough.

412
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,519
That's not what I heard.

413
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,021
About what?

414
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,443
I don't know what I'm talking about.

415
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,821
Last time, Aunt Bobbi
bought me a piranha.

416
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,531
A piranha? Come on!

417
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,200
That woman is not your aunt.

418
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,537
Livia, I warned you.
Bobbi is a sweet, sweet girl.

419
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,791
What's the matter?

420
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,209
What did I say?

421
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,963
This wife of yours,
she's got the giggles.

422
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,216
- Can I be excused?
- We just sat down!

423
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,594
- How can you play if you don't eat?
- You need protein.

424
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,764
- No, I don't, because I quit.
- You quit?

425
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,642
With Ally back, you can go to the states.

426
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,395
She slits her wrists,
and you think of a game?

427
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:30,190
It wasn't like Cobain.
It was just a little suicidal gesture.

428
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,027
- Come back here!
- You're not excused!

429
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,613
Let her go. Go ahead, honey!

430
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,532
- Ma!
- Why don't you butt out?

431
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,618
You only act nice when you
want to score points.

432
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,999
I will not eat in this house.

433
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,126
Junior, take me home.

434
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,421
- I'm not finished.
- She'll come back.

435
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:01,138
<i>The </i>Stukas<i> and </i>Messerschmitts<i>,
they have command of the skies.</i>

436
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:09,938
I don't know.

437
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,232
I'm glad Meadow quit.

438
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,986
That coach pushes them to the brink.
It's unhealthy.

439
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,739
What do we mean when we say commitment?

440
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,283
He thinks he can just walk away.

441
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,243
Watch it, cowboy, don't start.

442
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,374
- What's with you and Uncle Jun?
- Don't bother that coach.

443
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,836
- Come on. Tell me about Uncle Jun.
- No, stop it!

444
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,463
I can't!

445
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,132
- Yes, you can.
- All right. Okay.

446
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:44,806
Gabby Dante's cousin and Bobbi
go to the same nail parlor.

447
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:50,229
And your uncle...
No, I shouldn't say. I shouldn't!

448
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,981
- Come on.
- Okay, okay, okay.

449
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,196
Well, let's just say...

450
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,784
...your uncle has acquired
a taste for her.

451
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:05,994
Uncle Jun gives head?

452
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,788
World-class.

453
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,583
- He whistles to the wheat field?
- Don't be disgusting.

454
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,295
- He's a bushman of the Kalahari!
- That's why I don't tell you.

455
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,339
You don't know when to stop!

456
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,508
My God, if this ever gets out...

457
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,803
Yeah, like you don't do it.
Or any of your friends.

458
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,888
Bunch of hypocrites.

459
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:29,017
What goes on in this bedroom
stays here, and you know that.

460
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,814
Once a year?
I can resist the urge to gossip.

461
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,036
Arthur? You're home?

462
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,372
The grease in that Frialator.

463
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,417
I'm gonna smell like a cheap
French fry forever.

464
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:57,838
So this is why we scrimp and save
to send our kids to that school?

465
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,549
So our name is dragged through the mud?

466
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,050
What?

467
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,970
Shelly Hauser called me this afternoon.

468
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:09,057
Your friend sent some Y.O.'s
down there with a stolen TV set...

469
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,184
...to try and bribe the coach.

470
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,645
From your friends at Bada Bing!

471
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:18,984
As if a TV set is gonna get somewhere
with a man like Coach Hauser.

472
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,652
A TV set?

473
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:25,240
Do you honestly believe that
they're gonna stop there?

474
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,076
They tried bribing this man.

475
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,703
What's next?

476
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:34,499
- Always with the extreme scenarios.
- No, come on. Tell me, what's next?

477
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,209
You grew up here.

478
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:40,589
Don't pretend like you don't know
what Tony Soprano is capable of.

479
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,259
Who is it?

480
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:45,677
I found your dog.

481
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,686
What?

482
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,105
No, you're mistaken. My dog is upstairs.

483
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,108
Golden Retriever, blue nylon collar?

484
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,818
Honey, who is it?

485
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,028
Evening, ma'am.

486
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,949
He has our dog.

487
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,534
Where is Petey?

488
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,536
- He was locked in.
- Come get him.

489
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,997
I wouldn't want Petey
to get hit by a car.

490
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,850
Petey, Petey!

491
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,435
You okay? Come here.

492
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,479
What, no reward?

493
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,441
Just kidding. I'm an animal lover.

494
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:44,820
You okay, boy?

495
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,823
Med, cheer up about the coach...

496
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,867
...because I feel he'll
reconsider the big move.

497
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,121
Did you do something?

498
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,831
What could I do?

499
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,793
He's gonna stick around and finish
what he started with the girls.

500
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,838
That's it.

501
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,715
Well, did I tell you?

502
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:15,183
Develop some appreciation,
because everyone helps you...

503
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,644
...and all you do is bitch and moan!

504
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:22,023
This coach abandons his team,
and your friends get all worked up.

505
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,692
So I try to do something.

506
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,861
Is that why you think we're upset?

507
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,739
Because a coach who most of us
can't even stand is leaving?

508
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,410
You don't have to love
him to be successful.

509
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,370
"Catfish" Hunter hated Billy Martin.

510
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,999
Bill Parcells' guys can't stand him,
till they start to win.

511
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,626
Coach Hauser had sex with Ally.

512
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,212
What?

513
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,842
That's why she cut herself.
That's why I've been living at her house.

514
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,596
All right, hold on a minute.

515
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,097
Maybe...

516
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,393
With Ally?

517
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,604
Meadow, this is horrible.

518
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,858
This is also a serious accusation.
What exactly did Ally say?

519
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,944
That they had sex, more than once...

520
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,322
...that she's not a virgin anymore!

521
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,409
All right.

522
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,954
Ally's a very pretty girl.

523
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,623
Maybe there was...

524
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,584
Maybe there was confusion.
Maybe she wanted to...

525
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,420
...look like she was
sophisticated in your eyes.

526
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,384
- What?
- Tony, what if this had been Meadow?

527
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,595
What kind of confusion?

528
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,765
At her age? The coach shouldn't
have been in any position...

529
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,477
...where there's even a remote
possibility of confusion!

530
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,605
I'm losing my mind here.

531
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,066
Go downstairs so me and Meadow can talk.

532
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,401
Jesus fucking Christ!

533
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,072
God, now what did I do?

534
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,243
I only told so he wouldn't
make Coach Hauser stay.

535
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,788
Meadow, this is a horrible,
horrible thing.

536
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,208
She's in love with him.
But he won't leave his wife.

537
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,002
Leave his wife? Meadow!

538
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,966
- Now, he didn't touch you, right?
- No.

539
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,926
What about Deena?

540
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,762
If she hears about her father,
it'll destroy her.

541
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,932
Tell Dad to let him go
anywhere he wants, okay?

542
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,809
Come here.

543
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,986
Moldonado and his brother,
they'll handle it.

544
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,863
Mol owes me a solid.

545
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:38,451
No. No hired help. This is personal.

546
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,037
I'm glad to hear you say that.

547
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,873
I'm gonna give him a real
after-school special.

548
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,796
- You out of your mind?
- What?

549
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,467
You kidnapped the coach's dog.
But if you do one more thing...

550
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:58,263
Shut up, Arthur. You're five time
zones behind your own ass.

551
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,766
No, I'm fucking serious.
You hear me, Tony?

552
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,227
You're serious?

553
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,770
Want to hear serious?

554
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,023
Want to know what your coach did?

555
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:12,819
He fucked little Ally Vandermeed and
who knows who else he fucked.

556
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,530
What are you talking about? Fucked?

557
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:19,784
That's crazy.

558
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,621
That's why that kid slit her wrist.

559
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,581
And my daughter should know?

560
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,709
She should have to think
about that filth?

561
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,714
That self-righteous prick put his dick...

562
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,884
...in my little girl's soccer teammate.

563
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,220
Yeah. She's in 11th grade, for chrissake!

564
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,430
Oh, my God.

565
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,352
Chiara. He drove her home
one night when it was raining.

566
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,020
Oh, my little girl.

567
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,190
- Degenerate son of a bitch.
- He deserves to die!

568
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,734
Betraying children?

569
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:56,071
Believe me, he ain't gonna be
doing that shit no more.

570
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,448
I guarantee you that.

571
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,096
Nobody said to put my nephew
under surveillance.

572
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,932
I know, Junior. I know.

573
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,227
I wanted to be safe and I'm glad I was.

574
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,438
Because your nephew isn't
just at that titty bar...

575
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,524
...and going to soccer games.

576
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:33,983
Go ahead.

577
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,946
Twice last week he goes toward
the medical center...

578
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,447
...and they lose him.

579
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,032
A girlfriend.

580
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,453
He's seeing this Russian slit very open.

581
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,747
Your nephew is talking to the feds.

582
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:51,668
Where else would he be going
that requires such precautions?

583
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,629
What the fuck else would be
the big secret?

584
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,673
What am I, a swami?

585
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,973
How you doing? You're looking good.

586
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,641
How you feel?

587
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,480
You shanked it, Sil.

588
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,191
I still got the coach on my mind.

589
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:20,447
We got fresh air, we got sunshine.
Forget about that shit.

590
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,240
Thank God for golf some days.

591
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,576
I'm trying to concentrate here.

592
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,496
Did you get any golf in at Boca?

593
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,999
Fucking manners, please!

594
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:38,173
You play Manatee,
or what's that other one?

595
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:42,927
Will you let the man tee off?
You yap worse than six barbers!

596
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,014
If you'd have shut up during
that Mountain Lakes game...

597
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,349
...you wouldn't have
missed that fly ball.

598
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,518
I was ashamed to face my friends.

599
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,231
Good, Mikey. Better.

600
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,858
What do you mean, better?

601
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,861
Well, you know, it's better.

602
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,368
Whoa, Junior!

603
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,704
Whoa, Junior, what?

604
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,792
- Uncle Jun's into muff.
- What?

605
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,087
Oh, did I say muff? I meant ruff.

606
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,218
Good shot.

607
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,557
What's that smell?
Did you guys go to a sushi bar?

608
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,227
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

609
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:36,064
I thought you were a <i>baccala</i> man.
What are you doing eating sushi?

610
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,900
You're fucking running off at the mouth.

611
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,535
Listen, my friend.

612
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,663
At least I can deal with my own problems.

613
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,164
Unlike some I know.

614
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,415
What's that mean?

615
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,126
Take it however you want.
Don't bullshit me.

616
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,754
Guys, we here to play golf or what?

617
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,381
Come on.

618
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,765
Arthur...

619
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,228
...everybody's just so upset.

620
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:19,482
The mother's on sedatives.
She's completely unable to deal.

621
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,985
The father lives in Europe somewhere.

622
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:25,572
The little girl, Ally,
she thinks it's all her fault.

623
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,616
Bastard. He won't get away with this!

624
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,952
You got that right.

625
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,620
What?

626
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:37,041
Hand me that bottle of Bug-B-Gon,
will you?

627
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,626
Arthur, what?

628
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,923
Something going on, Artie?

629
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,386
Your mobster friend gonna do something?

630
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:54,225
If I had any balls, I would do it myself.

631
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,770
You do have balls.
That's why you're not like him.

632
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,022
Fuck it.

633
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,815
Fuck the world!

634
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,068
This isn't making a slob take his hat off.

635
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,448
This is beating a man to death
or cutting his balls off, or what?

636
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,243
You can't tell me he doesn't deserve it!

637
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,662
Okay, but...

638
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,582
Listen, think about what you're saying!

639
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,542
Yeah, you tell me.

640
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:23,296
Who's worse: Tony Soprano
or that child-molesting fuck?

641
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,634
I trusted him. I'd like to rip
his heart out of his chest!

642
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,429
Jesus Christ, I cannot believe
you only think about yourself!

643
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:32,805
Myself?

644
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,558
Myself?

645
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,227
I resent that, Charmaine.

646
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,242
Junior, what the fuck? What's the matter?

647
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,330
What? That bullshit with the sushi?

648
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:03,586
No. I don't know what he was
talking about. He babbles.

649
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,755
- What?
- You're another one!

650
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,549
Me? He completely lacked respect.

651
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,761
I'm tired of having to make
excuses for him.

652
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,764
- It isn't right.
- Because he's a mental weakling.

653
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,016
- I know.
- You don't know shit!

654
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,399
He's seeing a psychiatrist.

655
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,942
How about that?

656
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:30,279
My nephew is seeing a psychiatrist.
It makes me want to cry.

657
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,447
No shit?

658
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:35,159
The indictment's being prepared.
He's spilling his guts!

659
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,036
I fucking knew it.

660
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,914
No, you didn't know it. I just told you.

661
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,462
God knows how much of our
family business he has.

662
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,674
- If the place is bugged...?
- That's not admissible.

663
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:54,470
It's that doctor-patient privilege.
Just like us and Melvoin.

664
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,640
Melvoin's a lawyer.
He's in the fucking ballpark.

665
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,768
Suppose this shrink gets
scared or something?

666
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,604
Remember those two brothers in California?

667
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,732
They whacked their parents?

668
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,775
The shrink was in a witness chair.

669
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,778
Shit.

670
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,451
Anthony wants to play games, okay.

671
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,411
I taught him games.

672
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,623
I taught him how to play baseball.

673
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,212
Talking about clipping him?

674
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,423
Nobody would slap my wrist if I did.

675
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,386
Guys in prison have done
half the damage he has.

676
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:39,390
The judicial system has improved
in dealing with sexual predators.

677
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,392
Oh, yeah. Let's impeach him.

678
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,062
If you're telling me
of intent to harm him...

679
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,440
...I must warn you of my duty
to alert law enforcement.

680
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,067
Why do I tell you anything?

681
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:53,821
I'm interested in why you feel
punishing this man falls upon you.

682
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,115
- It doesn't fall upon you.
- What?

683
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,409
What would you do? You'd call the cops...

684
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:01,245
...who'd get some judge,
who'd give him counseling...

685
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:05,958
...to talk about his unhappy childhood,
and we could have sympathy for him.

686
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,169
Because he's the victim, right?

687
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:11,047
You know what you do?
You ignore the truth.

688
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,466
Discredit psychology all you want.

689
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:18,137
But I continue to ask the question.
Why do you think you...

690
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,682
...always have to set things right?

691
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,193
Hey, Paulie, is Tony in?

692
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,279
I got to talk to you.

693
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:36,614
I'm busy right now.

694
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,407
I got to talk to you.

695
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,204
All right. We'll finish later, all right?

696
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,801
Come on in.

697
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:08,437
It's about the thing.

698
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,856
You know what?

699
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:15,319
- Nothing's happened yet, has it?
- Just got to make the call.

700
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:18,739
- I'm savoring the moment.
- Call it off.

701
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,117
Don't worry about it.

702
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,660
You don't go near this.

703
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,580
I don't care about that.
It's wrong, Tony.

704
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:29,417
- You can't do it.
- It's wrong?

705
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,751
What he did isn't?

706
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,254
I'm begging you. I hate the guy too.

707
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,215
What do you want to do?

708
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,969
Want to call the cops? Here's the phone.

709
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,471
They'll arrest him.

710
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,600
And he'll get out in two years
and move north.

711
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,934
And then?

712
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,687
He'll teach girls soccer
and start all over.

713
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:53,608
You don't think I want to rip
him apart like a chicken?

714
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,612
I drove by his house. I almost got out.

715
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,780
But you didn't.

716
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,825
Something happens to him,
who does it help?

717
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,828
His daughter? That girl?

718
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,413
No. You, Tony.

719
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:12,752
And Silvio and me and whoever.
It's just gonna make us feel better.

720
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:17,632
So don't even think about calling this justice.
Leave it to the cops.

721
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,009
Look, let me ask you a question.

722
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:23,638
Who are you, coming in here
talking to me like this?!

723
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,850
Now, your boyfriend is finished.
You deal with it!

724
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,143
Okay?

725
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,604
Tony, don't do it.

726
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,272
This is me asking you.

727
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,024
Why don't you get out?!

728
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,651
Come on.

729
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,819
Get the fuck out, go!

730
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,404
Let's go!

731
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,240
Come on, come on!

732
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,821
Corrado?

733
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,616
I was worried! You usually
call me when you're this late.

734
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:13,247
I bought us some barbecued chicken,
salad and lemon meringue pie.

735
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,166
But I got hungry and ate.

736
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,543
Did I tell you to keep your mouth shut?!

737
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:21,047
Did I tell you to keep your
goddamn mouth shut?!

738
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:22,923
Don't hit me!

739
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,735
You stupid fucking blabbermouth cunt!

740
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,197
I don't understand!

741
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,951
Get your pencils and your crap
and don't be here tomorrow!

742
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,871
No, Corrado. Don't leave.

743
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,207
I love you!

744
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,211
I am so sorry!

745
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,588
No, Corrado!

746
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,945
- Yeah?
- <i>You there at the place?</i>

747
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,363
<i>Is he in the house?</i>

748
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,491
<i>Fuck it. Walk away.</i>

749
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,368
<i>Just walk away. Don't do it.</i>

750
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,578
Fuck!

751
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:35,830
All right.

752
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,833
- <i>Leave it alone.</i>
- Yeah. No problem.

753
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,961
Son of a bitch!

754
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,172
<i>Colleagues and neighbors were shocked...</i>

755
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,175
<i>...to hear of charges
brought against Hauser...</i>

756
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:51,762
<i>...coach of the Verbum Dei
high school girls' soccer team.</i>

757
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,598
<i>Alerted by a friend of the alleged victim...</i>

758
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,226
<i>...whose name cannot be revealed...</i>

759
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,062
<i>...police issued a warrant for his arrest.</i>

760
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:19,540
Tony, Jesus! You smell like Lord Calvert.

761
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,440
What is with you tonight?

762
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:49,528
What is this?

763
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,448
Jesus!

764
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,074
Mixed with alcohol!

765
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,203
Tony, that's wonderful. Happy trails.

766
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,996
Here, let's get you to bed.

767
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,670
I didn't hurt nobody.

768
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:25,356
Call the shrink. Tell her the town's
going to give her a fucking bonus.
