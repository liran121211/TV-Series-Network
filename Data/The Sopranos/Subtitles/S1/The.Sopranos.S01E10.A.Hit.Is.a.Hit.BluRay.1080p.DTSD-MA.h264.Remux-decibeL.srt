1
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,607
Talk it through the opening.

2
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,151
A little left.
A little left on your end.

3
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,569
All right!

4
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,325
Open the door.

5
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:00,871
Any hinky shit, you'll be refrying
beans with Pablo Escobar again.

6
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,211
This is all a message to your friends:
Stay away from Port Newark.

7
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,382
Don't even drive out to Jersey,
not even on Sundays.

8
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:18,013
They've been told. Twice.
Now I'll tell them.

9
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,434
Here!

10
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,395
Holy shit!

11
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,022
Bingo!

12
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,191
We can't fit it all!

13
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,235
Fucking crackheads and their small bills.

14
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,285
This is a token of my appreciation,
for recommending Dr. Melfi.

15
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,080
She's a good shrink.
I'm not a model patient...

16
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,874
What? What? You didn't have to.

17
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,127
These are Montecristos.
These are Cuban.

18
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,088
Yeah, they're the best, right?

19
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,714
Aren't they illegal?

20
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,675
They're cigars.

21
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,429
- Oh, they're dreamy, Ton.
- You're a good neighbor, Bruce.

22
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,600
I'm a doctor. I make referrals all the time.
You don't have to...

23
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:07,229
- No biggie.
- I bet these were hard to come by.

24
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,939
They fell off a truck.

25
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,900
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

26
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,444
- Hello?
- It's done.

27
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,447
It's the biggest refrigerator
you've ever seen.

28
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,699
And the other thing?

29
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,619
Juan Valdez has been separated
from his donkey.

30
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,836
You know, Ton, I been watching
you out back with your putter.

31
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,921
- You ever play at the club?
- No.

32
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,632
I play Minnisink, the public course.

33
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,636
You ought to come to the club
and play sometime.

34
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,598
- No, you know, it's...
- Come on! It's a wicked back nine.

35
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,060
Besides, I think you'd like some
of the members very much.

36
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,271
Yeah, maybe, you know...

37
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:50,939
We'll see.

38
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,816
Here we go.

39
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,319
- Fresh champagne, gentlemen.
- Oh, that's beautiful!

40
00:03:56,528 --> 00:04:00,323
- I love a mixed salad.
- I could stare at it for hours.

41
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,993
A score like this happens
once in a lifetime.

42
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,454
Gotta make this work for us, legit.

43
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,623
Find a nice IPO, keep it spinning,
live off the juice.

44
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,168
- IP who?
- Tony!

45
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,502
Yeah, yeah?

46
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,757
IPO, Initial Public Offering, stock,
insider market trading shit.

47
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,342
- Where's my baby?
- Understand?

48
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,513
Paulie, baby. Get that big dick
in the Jacuzzi, now!

49
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,684
Taking off.

50
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,939
- Gonna celebrate, me and Adriana.
- Mother of mercy!

51
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,817
- Could this be the end of RICO?
- Maybe.

52
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,944
Just may be!

53
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,863
- Have fun!
- Say hello.

54
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,865
Say hello to your girl for me.

55
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,702
Thank you so much for taking
me to the theater.

56
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,165
<i>Rent</i>. Fucking Broadway musicals.

57
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:55,504
We're supposed to be all weepy because
the heat's off in some guy's loft?

58
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,547
I'm humming the scenery, Chrissy!

59
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,343
Fifth row center and dinner at Le Cirque!

60
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,679
I'm embarrassed to be hungry again.

61
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,890
Thank you.

62
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,101
After how many years
with Tony Soprano's crew...

63
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,562
...some shit has finally worked out.

64
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,942
Just when I was starting
to wonder if, you know...

65
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,737
Whose welfare check you
gotta cash to get a burger?

66
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,073
Hey, shut the fuck up!

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,451
Wouldn't it be cool to own
a restaurant like Le Cirque?

68
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,913
<i>Madonna,</i> with the careers.

69
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,208
The black guy over there,
he look familiar?

70
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,379
Why don't you just forget about
working and be with me?

71
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:38,547
Oh, yeah.

72
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,716
And be one of those wives
like Carmela Soprano:

73
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:46,972
Breast-feeding rug rats and spending
the rest of your life at the gym.

74
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,768
You're right. My cousin's always had a brain,
but what does she use it for?

75
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,105
With a husband who can't tell
you where the money's from.

76
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,109
- What am I back here, Mark Fuhrman?
- You're a dick, man!

77
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,777
Chris, would you chill?

78
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,238
It's fucking discrimination, already!

79
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,614
Hey!

80
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,785
About time. Excuse me.

81
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,757
Bold men make bold statements.

82
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,845
Why'd they send you?
I'm looking for a burger, not converted rice.

83
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,599
Your woman looks embarrassed.

84
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:38,064
Give me a couple of burger baskets.

85
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:45,405
He's only bold because he's semi-hooked up
with the Tony Soprano crew.

86
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,998
What's with the attitude?
If it's not the blacks, it's somebody else.

87
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,669
- Nice.
- Must be the homie with the blue hat.

88
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,962
Yo!

89
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,839
Donnie Brasco.

90
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:04,799
Yeah?

91
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,637
My name is Orange J.
I'm down with Massive Genius.

92
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,598
That's who it was.
The gangsta rapper.

93
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,642
I told you to shut up!

94
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:18,438
We're having a party at G's crib.
Englewood Cliffs. You interested?

95
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,485
And I get served with black-eyed peas tomorrow?
Yo, I know what time it is.

96
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:28,239
Massive's heard of the crew you with.
There's business to be done.

97
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,030
This is a beautiful, beautiful home.

98
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,410
Smaller than my Hamptons crib,
but that's bigger than Steven's.

99
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,037
It's Italian contractors obviously.

100
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,415
Look at all these gold records!

101
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,420
What do we have here?

102
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,136
You like that shit?

103
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,557
A little Christmas present to myself.

104
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,060
Isn't that a sight to behold?

105
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,649
I do so love a good firearm in my hand.

106
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,619
You people are all right.

107
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,665
<i>Godfather</i>, I seen that movie 200 times.

108
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,835
<i>Godfather II</i> was definitely the shit!

109
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,962
The third one...

110
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:10,383
...a lot of people didn't like it,
but I think it was just misunderstood.

111
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,930
So what business you want to discuss?

112
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,276
- Mr. Herman Rabkin.
- Hesh.

113
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,321
I don't know him personally,
but I know his history.

114
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,699
In the late '50s and '60s,
he owned F-Note Records.

115
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,161
Yeah, Hesh was in the music business.

116
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,996
Little situation here.

117
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:45,001
My mother's deceased distant cousin,
Little Jimmy Willis, '50s legend.

118
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,587
Two seminal hit records was his legacy.

119
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,714
Drug tragedy.

120
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,841
- "Such a Fool."
- Oh, I love that!

121
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,385
They play it all the time
on oldies radio.

122
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,678
Old Herman?

123
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,808
He's just another white
motherfucker stealing royalties...

124
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,477
...from the black man
that made him the money.

125
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:07,524
Jimmy's mother, who I'm content
to call my aunt, is owed that money.

126
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:14,364
Hesh is the sweetest guy.
But I know his opinion on giving back Israel.

127
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,492
I can only imagine what
he'll say about this shit.

128
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:22,372
Feel free to enjoy the food
and any other enjoyments.

129
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,169
Champagne, sir. Ma'am?

130
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,512
That guy's a gangsta?
I'm a gangsta.

131
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,641
I'm an OG, original gangsta.
Not him, fucking lawn jockey.

132
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,644
But he's got the fly Hamptons house.

133
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:49,232
Alec Baldwin comes over.
Whitney Houston. What do I got?

134
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,734
I sit in a fucking pork store,
for chrissake.

135
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,572
But the moolies, they got it going on.
And they're on TV.

136
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,532
They don't take no shit.

137
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,120
Soprano crew, it's always secret this,
<i>omertà</i> that. Gets on my nerves.

138
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,248
Junior with his moldy sweaters,
and he's a fucking boss.

139
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,252
You were just feeling
so good about yourself.

140
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,380
Our thing once ruled the music
business, did you know?

141
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,426
- No.
- We bankrolled acts, blacks, everybody.

142
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,596
Paid the DJs or busted heads
to get them played on the air.

143
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,764
There were great Italian singers.

144
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:26,853
Fucking A. Frankie Valli, Dion,
The Rascals, the whole Philly thing.

145
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,939
My dad used to talk about those guys.

146
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,276
Now? Fucking drum machine,
some ignorant poetry...

147
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,613
...and any dropout <i>ditsoon</i>
is chairman of the board.

148
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,282
Gangsta.

149
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,913
Talk about <i>paesano</i> pride. Go, Jovi!

150
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,562
- Oh, you're home.
- Hey.

151
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:14,234
- Barb Wagner called, you remember her?
- The mayonnaisers from up the street?

152
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,569
They invited us to a barbecue.

153
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,367
All right. Didn't think so.

154
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,747
Still with the brochures?

155
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,751
You believe how much it costs
for a college education?

156
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,920
We got enough.

157
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,674
I know we got enough,
but how much is enough?

158
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,176
God forbid, what if something
should happen?

159
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:44,389
Call up old man Coletti, tell him not to put
too much makeup on my face.

160
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,849
Don't joke around about this, Tony.

161
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,977
You'll be taken care of.

162
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,730
You always tell me that,
"I'll be taken care of." By who?

163
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:57,527
What is with the look?
Did you just make a score?

164
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,114
No. I wish.

165
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,867
You know, Tony,
it's a multiple-choice thing with you.

166
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:09,664
Because I can't tell if you're
old-fashioned, you're paranoid...

167
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,749
...or just a fucking asshole.

168
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,088
So what do I tell the Wagners?

169
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,715
Do you want to go?

170
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,049
Sure.

171
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:25,096
Even Cusamano asked me to play
a little golf with him at his club.

172
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,515
- Sorry.
- All right, all right.

173
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:38,359
Prick. New maître d',
he's really on the rag tonight.

174
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,737
I'll talk to him.

175
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,324
- Remember Richie Santini?
- Yeah, you used to fuck him.

176
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:49,120
That really sums it up. I knew him
since we were 3, he lived next door.

177
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,123
Yeah, we had our little phase.

178
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,293
- What about him?
- You've heard his band?

179
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,130
Defiler? I'm not into that headbanging shit.

180
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,593
You talked about the good old days:
Italians running the music business.

181
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,764
Richie's this musician who you know.
They're not a hair band anymore.

182
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,098
And they're good!

183
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,436
You said yourself how much
money there was in this thing.

184
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,939
You mean like, Richie Santini?

185
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,444
Would Massive Genius be interested?

186
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,614
It's a whole different thing. Black.

187
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:29,952
But he's got Massive G Productions.
Shit, they make movies even!

188
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:37,377
Massive does owe me a favor.
I'm arranging a sit-down with Hesh.

189
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:42,590
I was thinking about...
Okay, okay, I know this sounds kind of funny.

190
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,801
Music management.

191
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,805
I have met people, important people...

192
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:54,185
...learned people skills, how to deal
with big egos, solve problems.

193
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,605
And with my love of all kinds of music...

194
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,568
Maybe Alec Baldwin would
come to our house.

195
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:30,847
It's an old demo.

196
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,433
No, you know what?

197
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,726
Fuck it.

198
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,854
Let's set you up.

199
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,523
- What?
- I got money.

200
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,068
With how much you listen
to the radio, you'd be good.

201
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,696
I can't believe it.

202
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,073
But I get to pick what you wear.

203
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,869
Dress you up. I like that.

204
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,094
This place has the flavor.

205
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,055
That gelding, name is Sydney.

206
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,267
You never wrote a song about him?

207
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,647
When you and Little Jimmy
were writing all his hits...

208
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,568
...did you write the music and him
the lyrics or vice versa?

209
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,654
We had our own process.

210
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,783
So that "Ooh, wacka-doo,
wacka-dooly do, I'm so blue..."

211
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,120
That spring from your experience
or the little brother's?

212
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,498
One could write a song about a horse.

213
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,250
But to be a hit with your audience...

214
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:45,213
...you'd have a cop on him,
be ripped up the ass with a Mac 10, no?

215
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,133
So you bought horses with your royalties.

216
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,761
What about Little Jimmy's royalties?

217
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,930
He bought horse.

218
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:59,268
Music business back then,
we broke all the rules as we went along.

219
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,479
You mean raping and pillaging.

220
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,773
Things haven't changed much, huh?

221
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,944
Were we hard-nosed? Yeah.
But we gave a lot of kids their start.

222
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,113
A lot of Negro youth.
Took them out of the ghetto.

223
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,740
Put them on the stage.

224
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,120
Ordinarily I'd be more than happy
to stroll down Memory Lane with you...

225
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,414
...but I want reparations.

226
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,417
Why don't we call this what it is?
A shakedown.

227
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,420
Your father was a silent
partner in F-Note Records.

228
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,966
Made sure that the records
got airplay, right?

229
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,760
That money bought my house
at the Jersey Shore.

230
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,721
What are you gonna do?
I'm guided by you.

231
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,391
He's gotta do the right thing, that's what.

232
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:43,229
You're way out of line, kid.
Let's get some cold water on your head.

233
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,696
Thank you, Jen.
Let's get right to the point, huh?

234
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,155
What's in this for you?

235
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,491
If you read Chuck D's book...

236
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,119
...he advises that reparations be made...

237
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,289
...by the Jewish studio moguls in Hollywood.

238
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,250
For the way black folks
were portrayed on film.

239
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,461
It's germane to this argument in that...

240
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,132
...the grievances in the music
business are far worse.

241
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,302
You're talking to the wrong
white man, my friend.

242
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,764
My people were the white man's nigger
when yours were still chasing zebras.

243
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,269
As far as Louis B. Mayer is concerned,
what are you, nuts?

244
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,898
My lawyers have done research.

245
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:33,738
I think that the final figure is
somewhere around $400,000.

246
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:40,703
Now, a cashier's check made
to a Mrs. Idella Willis...

247
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,455
...will set it straight.

248
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,165
Or what?

249
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,088
What was it that she called him?

250
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:52,923
Oh, yeah.

251
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,553
"That nice man," I think she said.

252
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,815
So how's your neighbor?
The one with no neck?

253
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,567
The Sopranos?

254
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,738
There's a new car in the driveway
every other week. Besides that...

255
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,908
He gave me a gift of some
excellent Cuban cigars.

256
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,117
And you accepted them.

257
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,412
See? Eroding the neighborhood values.

258
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,833
He was thanking me for the physician,
which he is very happy with.

259
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,502
Really?

260
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,757
What does that do to property values?
Having a gangster living next door?

261
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,217
Are you kidding?

262
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,720
Safest block in the neighb.
Being a gangster, what's that mean?

263
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:44,266
The shit I see in the boardroom,
I don't know if I'd make a distinction.

264
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,811
Oh, will you, please?
It's not the same.

265
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,522
Bugging, bribes? I don't know.

266
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,776
I think the only thing separating
American business from the Mobs...

267
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,611
...is whacking somebody.

268
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,071
- Listen to you!
- What?

269
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,948
Whacking!

270
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:04,078
He hangs around with Tony Soprano
and it's "fucking this, fucking that."

271
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:10,167
We were there for that fundraiser.
I didn't see any guns anywhere.

272
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,796
But that bar with the <i>goombah</i> Murano glass.

273
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,634
I like Murano glass.

274
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,807
Those Montecristos.

275
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,643
What do you say? After dinner?

276
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,058
It ain't your type of music, but...

277
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,145
I like any kind of music
that turns shit green.

278
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,524
He's been through a lot.
It's deepened his writing.

279
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,152
As a metal band they were
great, but this...

280
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,530
...as far as I am concerned,
blows away Matchbox 20.

281
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,115
What do they call themselves?

282
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:27,536
Used to be Defiler. Then some
personnel changes, bass and drums.

283
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,539
But Richie and Vito are still
the core of the band.

284
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,750
Now they're called Visiting Day.

285
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,724
This is some loud shit!

286
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,242
That's Richie.

287
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,121
And that's Vito.

288
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,170
Fuck you!

289
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,589
Sit the fuck down, you mullethead!

290
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,889
This isn't the right place for them.

291
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,562
You suck!

292
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,772
Without the right help from you...

293
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,734
...Visiting Day could end up
in the miscellaneous V section.

294
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,162
You interested?

295
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,499
Yes.

296
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,174
That scene where Pesci sticks
the guy's head in a vise...

297
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,803
...and then pops his eye out.
I thought I was gonna die!

298
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,935
I'll be right back, okay?

299
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,063
Excuse me.

300
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,690
- It's this way?
- Yes.

301
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,150
Thank you.

302
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,151
- I don't know.
- What?

303
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,697
Richie, the guy's 30,
still lives with his parents.

304
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,532
It's because of the accident.

305
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,952
Richie had third-degree burns from trying...

306
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,829
...to grill that trout with a downed power line.

307
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:20,000
But at the same time, being
electrocuted turned his life around.

308
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,754
Well, you did some ace fucking selling.

309
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,214
You think?

310
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,549
Yeah, thing is though...

311
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,679
...music is not something you can
hold in your hands, you know?

312
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:36,684
Like football betting, cards or coke.

313
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,560
It's art.

314
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:42,731
Berry Gordy, whatever,
he had to see it in the Supremes.

315
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,694
It's an instinct. I see it in Richie.

316
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,571
Yeah, probably is.

317
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,950
I'm really fucking doing it!

318
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,411
And it's all thanks to you.

319
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:01,291
I'm gonna make a demo CD like
Massive advised. And then, yeah!

320
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,627
My wife thinks I need to meet new people.

321
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,547
- So?
- You're Italian, you understand.

322
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,342
We're brought up to think
the <i>americani</i> are fucking bores.

323
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,512
But the average white
man's no more boring...

324
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:17,933
...than the millionth conversation over
who should have won, Marciano or Ali.

325
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,311
Am I to understand that you
don't consider yourself white?

326
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:25,149
I don't mean white like Caucasian.
I mean a white man.

327
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,443
Like our friend Cusamano.

328
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,612
Now, he's Italian, but he's <i>americano</i>.

329
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:35,200
What Dad called a "Wonder Bread Wop."
He eats his Sunday gravy out of a jar.

330
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:39,621
You seem to want to branch out.
What's stopping you?

331
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,582
The guys, you know.

332
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,628
What they'd think if I started
hanging out with the <i>americani</i>.

333
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:00,809
I was in the neighborhood last night.
At the Cusamano's.

334
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,397
Oh, yeah?

335
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,691
Dinner party.

336
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,989
You should have stopped by.
Live right next door.

337
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:26,043
You didn't hear any strange noises
last night in your neighborhood?

338
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,337
Noises?

339
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,465
Like someone screaming in pain?

340
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,176
No.

341
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,347
Probably a television set.

342
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,645
You saw my house?

343
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,617
Oh, this looks good.

344
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,289
That sausage, where'd you get it?
That place in Garfield?

345
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,544
- Honey? Where'd we get the sausage?
- That place in Garfield.

346
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:12,214
The only thing better than
<i>salsiccia</i> is a pair of tits.

347
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,675
It's a hell of a piece of meat.

348
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,886
<i>Salsiccia</i> is a kind of a phallic thing.

349
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,680
Whereas tits...

350
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,395
Jack, you're a stockbroker, right?

351
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,273
Any changes in the market coming?

352
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,025
- It's always changing.
- Keeps us coming back.

353
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,447
Rand, you hear from Ross on Dexplex?

354
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,741
No, but the buyout is going down.

355
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,744
Give me some warning.
I need to call the islands.

356
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,079
Dexplex?

357
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,923
It's a little company.
It's going public, maybe.

358
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,093
Come on. The sun is shining,
it's a beautiful day.

359
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,596
Let's not talk business for once.

360
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,097
American Biotics.

361
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,184
Barb, our stock guru.

362
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,270
She thinks American Biotics
may be a good investment.

363
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:11,940
They're close to a side-effect-free
anti-impotence drug.

364
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,775
You guys play the stock market?

365
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,153
Oh, we don't just play...

366
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,696
...we win.

367
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,318
That's take 62.

368
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,236
We ought to just bag it.

369
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,747
Okay, we're bagging it.

370
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,916
<i>We should've bagged this days
ago when it was perfect.</i>

371
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,586
I wish I had thought of that.

372
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,592
It's good. You know, not bad.

373
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,635
It's as good as we'll get.

374
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,930
Oh, it wasn't too bad.
It was kind of good!

375
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,519
What are you saying?
Is something wrong?

376
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,774
We're all trying our best here.
I just think we hit a brick wall.

377
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,609
Maybe some rest.

378
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,029
Hey, hey, fuck that!

379
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,281
I paid for three days' studio time.

380
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,951
It'll only cost me more to pack
it up and come back again.

381
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,455
We got through the instrumental
tracks with no problem.

382
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,457
I'm fucking beat.

383
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,501
What about we finish this shit?

384
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,961
Three days we've been slamming our hams!

385
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,131
Kinko's gave me five days off.
No big deal.

386
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:27,302
Kinko's? Buddy, this is costing
me 300 bucks an hour!

387
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,762
Here, try this.

388
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,143
Dude, I don't do drugs anymore, okay?

389
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:39,147
Well, hats off. But for all
the excitement in these songs...

390
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,150
...maybe you should suck
on another downed power line.

391
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,527
Christopher!

392
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:48,073
That was our most introspective song.
It's not supposed to rock.

393
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,700
- It'll be our first single.
- No, second.

394
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,995
- "Sharon's Chair" will bust out.
- I like "Melt."

395
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,707
Come on. Go shoot the crank.
Let's wrap this up.

396
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,087
- What?
- You heard me. Spike up!

397
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,338
No fucking way.

398
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,882
I'm producing these sessions.

399
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,553
Go take the fucking drugs!
I'm not fucking around anymore!

400
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,555
Look, the problem, Christopher...

401
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,892
...is the bass and the drum tracks
were miked wrong from the beginning!

402
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,604
Hey, King of Rock,
you're out of your depth.

403
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,523
Let me tell you something.

404
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,026
Thank you, but I've recorded in Denmark.

405
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:28,196
You wanna know what the problem is?

406
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,700
Where are the fucking choruses?

407
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,870
All your songs, you got no choruses.

408
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,040
Your choruses are just another verse.
What happened to "She loves You"?

409
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:40,584
"She Loves You"?

410
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,003
Yeah, the song started with the chorus.

411
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:46,423
There is structure.
That's how you build a song.

412
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:51,803
The Beatles. That's been 40 years
now and it makes me fucking sick!

413
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,638
What is he, nuts?

414
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,974
- Fuck this, man.
- Where you going?

415
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,769
I'm going to AA, you fucking jerk-off!

416
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,397
- Get back to work.
- Christopher!

417
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,566
- Okay.
- Come on, come on!

418
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,735
Big man, huh?

419
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,494
- Fuck!
- You all right?

420
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,917
What? What...
Get back in the booth!

421
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,130
So we take it from the top.

422
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,883
We'll use a ukulele.

423
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,760
I can't believe you!

424
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,095
5,000 shares.

425
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,932
Yes, American Biotics.

426
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,018
Yeah, can you place the order today?

427
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:44,689
Okay, great. I'll have the money
to you by tomorrow.

428
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,694
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

429
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,160
- What, are you spying on people now?
- I live here.

430
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,496
You playing Wall Street now?

431
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:04,042
Women are better savers than men.
And we are nurturers.

432
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,962
What do you know about the stock market?

433
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:11,633
I keep my ears open.
CNBC is a very interesting channel.

434
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,055
Your father, God bless him,
does very well.

435
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:21,434
But who knows? What if something
unforeseen should happen?

436
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:24,521
What if he gets hit by a truck?
I mean, then what?

437
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,982
- I got you kids to think about.
- I don't know.

438
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,733
When you get married, you will.

439
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:34,114
A woman has to keep her individuality.
This here is a life lesson.

440
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,537
Okay.

441
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,541
Let's go to Georgette Klinger's.
Massage, facial...

442
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,669
<i>...jour de beauté.</i> On me.

443
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,130
Sure.

444
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,472
- It's a lily.
- Now, that's a shot.

445
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,684
- "Ball runs like a frightened faun."
- W.C. Fields.

446
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,854
- That thing's still running!
- This is a nice place.

447
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,940
Didn't I tell you?
We ought to make you a member.

448
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,735
Tony, you ever play
that place in Orlando?

449
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,989
No, I never get down there.
Well, Disneyworld.

450
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,158
You know, Al's place.

451
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:20,368
Mount Plymouth?

452
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,579
- Al Capone built it.
- No shit?

453
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:27,917
- He was a golf fanatic, that's right.
- So you guys watch <i>A&E</i>.

454
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,923
Tony, let me ask you a question.
If I'm stepping on toes, tell me.

455
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,759
How real was <i>The Godfather</i>?

456
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,766
I mean, in your opinion.

457
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:46,311
- What do you mean, real?
- Authentic or not.

458
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,355
I don't know.

459
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,776
How would I know?
It was the '50s, right?

460
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,489
- No, it wasn't. It was 1972.
- No, the story took place in the '50s.

461
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,617
Did you really have to cut your
finger and take an oath?

462
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,378
Like gridlock on Times Square today, isn't it?

463
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,506
Traffic in Manhattan's worsened
since "Don't block the box."

464
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:17,384
You got a lot of friends
in New York, Tony?

465
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,761
- Yeah.
- You ever go to Little Italy?

466
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,264
San Gennaro, the feast with the kids.

467
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,393
What do you think of when
you hear Mulberry Street?

468
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,770
- Umberto's.
- Hey! All right!

469
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:34,567
You ever see that picture of Galante dead,
with a cigar in his mouth?

470
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,947
- No.
- It was a fucking beautiful hit.

471
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:45,245
Sorry, Tony.
You probably knew the guy, huh?

472
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,706
How fucking old you think I am?

473
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,419
You don't have to answer this if you
don't want to, but I gotta know.

474
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,422
Did you ever meet John Gotti?

475
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,971
Yeah. I knew John.

476
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,639
Fuck!

477
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,684
What was he really like?

478
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,483
- Remember Bungalow Bar?
- The ice cream trucks?

479
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,320
Like Good Humor, except the trucks
had bungalow roofs on.

480
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,158
Was Gotti a silent partner in that?

481
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,744
I don't know nothing about that.

482
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,329
Just know that when the company folded...

483
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,499
...and they were auctioning off the last truck...

484
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,003
...the one with the peaked roofs,
you're right, Cuse.

485
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,134
When they were auctioning off
the last truck...

486
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,678
...and I wanted it as a souvenir...

487
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,056
...Gotti outbid me.

488
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,854
Gave me a ride home.

489
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:00,779
You know, he rang that bell
the whole way home?

490
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,542
They're waving at us.

491
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,393
Oh, I love this part.

492
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,694
This is good.

493
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,414
Some good guitar. Listen to that.

494
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,335
They got it going on.

495
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,003
Yeah.

496
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,245
So?

497
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,747
Well, I think it's not good.

498
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,251
Want to be more specific?

499
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,670
There's good and not good.
This is not good.

500
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,172
Maybe it's not your era, no offense.

501
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,801
Music is music. Talent is talent.
I don't care who you are.

502
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:51,556
I've seen them all. I saw heavy metal
invented by Hendrix at the Cafe Wah.

503
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,267
Kid just came out of the Army.
I said to him:

504
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:58,021
"I don't know if it's talent,
charisma, magic, but you got it."

505
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,399
These kids? They don't, sorry.

506
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,776
You're just pissed about the sit-down.

507
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,030
Get the fuck out of here
and stop wasting my time.

508
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,491
This Vito is a great fucking
guitar player, Hesh.

509
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,243
He's a great guitar player.

510
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,370
However, there's one constant in music.

511
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,582
A hit is a hit and this is not a hit!

512
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,042
- Why?
- Christ!

513
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:23,004
For reasons we couldn't comprehend
or codify, you pathetic schlepper!

514
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:27,467
Fucking Massive is a genius,
so what the fuck was he talking about?

515
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,178
When I was a kid, there was this guy.

516
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,846
We called him Jimmy Smash.

517
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,182
Now, he wasn't retarded.

518
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:39,354
But we thought he was because he
had one of these whatchamacallits:

519
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,815
"Hey, Jimmy, how the fuck are you?"

520
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,693
- What do you call that?
- Cleft palate.

521
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:46,945
Yeah.

522
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:53,826
Well, we was kids, right?
So what the hell did we know?

523
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,705
Every time he opened his mouth,
we'd piss ourselves laughing.

524
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:03,461
But Jimmy didn't mind because he got
to hang out with us, the popular crew.

525
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,713
We called him when we were bored.

526
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,926
Call him and say,
"Hey, Jimmy, sing 'Mack the Knife.'"

527
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,680
Because he wanted to hang out
with us, he'd belt it right out.

528
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,101
We'd fucking roll on the floor, laughing.

529
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:26,484
And then, you know, when the laughs
got old, we stopped calling him.

530
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,071
Wasn't until years later...

531
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,157
...I found out the poor prick
went home every night...

532
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,368
...and cried himself to sleep.

533
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,709
Then when I found out, you know...

534
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,794
...I felt bad.

535
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,718
But I never really
understood what he felt.

536
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,220
To be used, you know...

537
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,349
...for somebody else's amusement
like a fucking dancing bear.

538
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,602
Till I played golf with those guys.

539
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,816
You thought Cusamano was your friend.

540
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,486
You live, you learn.

541
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,452
Can I ask you a question?

542
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,622
Whatever happened to Jimmy?

543
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:25,710
Jimmy Smash?
He's doing 20 for robbery.

544
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,212
The cops knew who it was.

545
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:32,341
He goes to the bank in a mask and goes,
"Give me all your money!"

546
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,854
Some fucker's on the phone for you.

547
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:53,237
- Good morning, Herman. I'm listening.
- <i>Good.</i>

548
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:56,491
Don't miss what I have to say.
I've been thinking about it.

549
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,495
- Go on.
- Find another schmuck to screw with.

550
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,330
You do know what this means?

551
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,458
Stupid enough to say it over
the phone. Let's hear it.

552
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,002
I don't threaten, Herman. I act.

553
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:13,091
Genius, you're in way over your head.
Why don't you back up a bit?

554
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,676
You know, let sleeping dogs lie.

555
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,678
Hey, Soprano.

556
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,306
This is what I think about
this gangsta rap shit:

557
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:23,726
You probably got a degree
in sociology from a city college.

558
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,146
<i>I grew up in the projects. Delta 13.</i>

559
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,232
Killed a man.

560
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:33,653
Later on I got a degree,
but urban planning.

561
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:35,530
<i>You were close.</i>

562
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,032
Now, when it comes to
"Which is mightier...

563
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,285
...the pen or the motherfucking sword?"...

564
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,162
...I let the situation dictate.

565
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,705
Don't press it.

566
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:49,085
I'm gonna do my part to keep
Mr. Rabkin's people working.

567
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,461
What's that mean?

568
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,881
Expect to hear from Goldstein,
Baum and Woronov.

569
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,384
They represent us in the lawsuit.

570
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,927
You gonna sue?

571
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,555
With what I pay in retainers?
Fuck, yeah!

572
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:01,889
I hear that.

573
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,517
- <i>Yeah, well...</i>
- Listen, <i>tatteleh</i>.

574
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:09,313
Be advised that on your last single,
you sampled the backing vocal...

575
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:13,109
...from the Chablis' 1968
song, "Riff Wit It"...

576
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,487
<i>...for which F-Note Records
controls the recording rights.</i>

577
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,906
- No shit.
- <i>Yes, shit.</i>

578
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,909
I would, of course, have to countersue.

579
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,287
I'll see you in court.

580
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,498
Fucking legal fees.

581
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:32,587
What kind of <i>melanzane</i> are these?
They call themselves gangsters.

582
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,173
It's a new fucking day.

583
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,758
Fucking depressing.

584
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,803
Now, this is a Donatella Versace.

585
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,096
Nice.

586
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,724
You like it better than the Alaia?

587
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,816
- Keep them both.
- Christopher, $2400!

588
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,697
- I don't think you really like it.
- I like it. I like it.

589
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,958
MTV Awards?

590
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,297
What?

591
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,925
Nothing.

592
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,761
I thought that fight was over.

593
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,472
You want me to take it back?
No problem.

594
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,974
No! Fuck, I want you to have it.

595
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:46,327
You know how I use
positive visualization?

596
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,790
I know you talk about it.
You're fairly negative a lot of the time.

597
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:53,167
You should mentally prepare...

598
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:56,837
...for the fucking possibility
that Visiting Day sucks.

599
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,591
What?

600
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:05,513
You've gotten this far with Massive
because he wants to be in your pants.

601
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:08,975
Boy, oh, boy.

602
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:14,021
I let some experts listen to the demo.
They shit all over it.

603
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:18,401
Experts? Who? Hesh?
That old fucking synagogue cantor?

604
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,861
Silvio, he owned rock clubs in Asbury.

605
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,156
You heard what Squid said.
He's a professional engineer.

606
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:28,911
What about my opinion?
That it's good, that it's special?

607
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:39,880
His eyes are on your ass 98 percent
of the time. You know that.

608
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,551
You're just trying to keep me down!

609
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,052
That ain't fair!

610
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,721
I don't want these clothes.

611
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,521
What's wrong with it?
What's wrong with Visiting Day?

612
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:56,897
I don't know.

613
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,360
It's a problem that you don't know.
Richie, he'll sing anything.

614
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:06,574
You just don't believe my relationship
with Massive isn't based on fucking!

615
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,410
It's based on intelligence.

616
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,412
Respect. Talent!

617
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:12,913
I'll shut up.

618
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,628
You saying I don't have talent?

619
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:28,095
I branched out, made new friends,
new horizons and you can't stand that!

620
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:34,268
Yeah, go silent. That's you:

621
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,896
Either screaming your head off
or fucking dead.

622
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:41,734
I don't think I can stay here anymore.

623
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:51,786
- I love you.
- That is such a lie!

624
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:03,464
- Hey, Carmela!
- In here!

625
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,347
I need a finger.

626
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,976
- What's in the box?
- Sand.

627
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,812
I'm fucking with Cusamano.

628
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,313
Tony!

629
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,315
Beautiful!

630
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,526
You're cute when you're a bad boy.

631
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,903
You're awfully chipper today.

632
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:29,323
- So what are you doing with the box?
- Give it to him.

633
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:34,328
- Tell him to hold onto it for a while.
- Oh, Tony, that is so evil!

634
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,997
Yeah, I know.
That's why it's so much fun.

635
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,959
Oh, God.

636
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:02,690
Cuse! Cuse! Cuse!

637
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,358
Come here.

638
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,155
- Hey, Ton. How you doing?
- Good, how you doing?

639
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,450
Fine, thanks. Listen...

640
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,161
...you know, that nickname...

641
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,163
What? Cuse? Cusamano!

642
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,833
- It's got that other connotation...
- No, no, not anymore.

643
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:25,212
I need a little solid. I need you
to hang onto this for a while for me.

644
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:30,134
Hang onto it and I'll come
get it when I need it.

645
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:31,802
How long?

646
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,347
A month. Maybe more, maybe less.

647
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,225
- Okay? Thanks.
- Yeah, sure.

648
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,396
I meant to ask you about the club.
What's going on?

649
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,273
Oh, the club.

650
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:49,278
I'm sorry, Ton. Membership's closed.

651
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:52,364
- Closed?
- Yeah.

652
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:57,286
- No new members until old members die.
- Nobody's dying?

653
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:01,332
- Nothing we could do anything about.
- No biggie, Cuse.

654
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:02,833
- You sure?
- Thanks.

655
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,462
- I mean, because...
- No. I'll live.

656
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,029
Now, that's a hit.

657
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,835
What is it? Heroin?

658
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:32,172
Shit, Jean, I don't know.
A weapon? I don't know.

659
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,342
Could be anything.

660
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,139
Don't touch it.
