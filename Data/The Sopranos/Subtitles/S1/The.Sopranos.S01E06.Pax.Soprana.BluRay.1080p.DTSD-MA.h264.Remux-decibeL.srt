1
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,362
So...

2
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,866
...you know, usual girl stuff.

3
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,702
She picks up the dry-cleaning and shops.

4
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:03,999
Dr. Melfi has excellent taste, she only
shops at the fancy-schmancy deli.

5
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,211
The kind with the Italian name
but they don't have meatballs.

6
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,921
All right, what else?

7
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:14,176
What am I supposed to be looking for?
What's up with this cooz?

8
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,428
It's none of your fucking business.

9
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,389
You're on a strict need-to-know, lieutenant.

10
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,768
I should knock you out for
what you did to her date.

11
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:28,148
What? I scared your <i>goomar's</i> date a little.
What's the big deal?

12
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,779
- This guy still come around?
- No.

13
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,158
He's not her type. He's a coward.
He nearly pissed himself.

14
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,453
Anything else?
I don't want to be here all day.

15
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,915
Yesterday she got off at 9
and she went to bed early.

16
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,875
That's it?

17
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,460
That's it.

18
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,465
Here, buy yourself an iron.

19
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:01,973
Ready?

20
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,811
Decaf, right?

21
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,612
So how was your college
trip with your daughter?

22
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:20,784
I tell you, my life is like an
episode of <i>Provolone-something</i>.

23
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,369
What's going on?

24
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,038
My wife. All we do is fight.

25
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,166
And she's jealous of you.

26
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,046
Is that something that you feel or
has it been discussed with Carmela?

27
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,632
She didn't know you were a girl.

28
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,804
You know, a woman.
Excuse me, a doctor.

29
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,597
Woman doctor.

30
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,809
- Why did you take so long to tell her?
- I didn't.

31
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,395
You spilled the beans when you called.

32
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:53,275
Let me ask you a different question.
Why a female? Why a female doctor?

33
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:58,196
She asked the same frigging question,
and I sometimes wonder myself.

34
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,074
- And?
- I'll tell you what I told her.

35
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:06,163
It was between two Jewish guys and a <i>paesana</i>.
So I picked the <i>paesana</i>.

36
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:11,501
What's the one thing your mother,
wife and daughter have in common?

37
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,378
They all break my balls.

38
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,592
I know what you mean.
They're all Italian, so what?

39
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:23,221
So maybe by coming clean with me,
you're dialoguing with them.

40
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,432
Let me ask you a question.

41
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,769
Why do you have me as a patient?

42
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,232
Most legit people I know wouldn't
make eye contact with me.

43
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,859
But you...

44
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,986
...you didn't flinch.

45
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,670
- Water's warm, come on in.
- Hey, Sammy. How are you?

46
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,550
- I was just gonna make some coffee.
- Yeah?

47
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,802
How's Junior?

48
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,890
Sit the fuck down! Down!

49
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,895
That's how Junior is, Sammy.

50
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,314
I'm with little Jimmy Altieri.

51
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:18,360
Yeah, you paying Jimmy for this game?
Huh, Sammy?

52
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,528
No.

53
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,823
Are you paying someone for this game?

54
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,703
Now the party's over.

55
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,958
Junior Soprano is the new boss...

56
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,627
...and he ain't respecting
old arrangements.

57
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,379
Hey, you're lucky.

58
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,174
You stayed slender.
You could buy it right off the rack.

59
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,593
I want something special.

60
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,763
The boys are having a little time for me.

61
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,349
You're wearing the suit
to the dinner, eh?

62
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,228
These guys today want to be
buried in a jogging outfit.

63
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,150
So how's your...
What's your oldest boy's name?

64
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,071
- Rafael. "Ralphie."
- Yeah.

65
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,781
- Good kid.
- Yeah.

66
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,284
He lost his son, you know.

67
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,869
What do you mean, "lost"?

68
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,580
Dead. <i>Morto.</i>

69
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,461
Just a fucking kid! A baby!

70
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,800
What are we talking about here?
You lost your grandson?

71
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,304
What are you gonna do
with these fucking animals...

72
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,140
...these drug dealers?

73
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,350
He used to run around breaking balls.

74
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,728
Dominic.

75
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,646
My namesake.

76
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,733
Did you know about this?

77
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,113
What'd I say about this poison?
These kids shouldn't touch it!

78
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:50,577
I read the paper every day about
these poor pricks overdosing.

79
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,371
He didn't overdose, he killed himself.

80
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,498
Fourteen years old.

81
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,169
- Jesus!
- Was this at Patterson Falls?

82
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,380
Holy shit, that was your grandson?

83
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,926
- What?
- He took one of those designer drugs.

84
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,970
Goes to the Falls, takes
a header right off the fence.

85
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:14,351
They said the current bashed his head
on rocks for days before he came up.

86
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,940
And meanwhile, this piece of shit...

87
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:25,153
...he gets to walk the streets and sell
more of this stuff to young kids.

88
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,988
Oh, really?

89
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,367
What's this motherless fuck's name?

90
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,375
- Even the coffee's old in here.
- How much can you complain?

91
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,835
Eventually, you've got a broken hip.

92
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:45,215
I want to give you a <i>macchinetta</i>.
It's the only way to get good coffee.

93
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,217
What are you wearing?

94
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,552
You smell like a French <i>putain</i>.

95
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,888
It's Canoe. Johnny wore Canoe.

96
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,557
Morning, Livia.

97
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,102
- Oh, good morning.
- Morning.

98
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,645
- Yeah, hi.
- New arrival?

99
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,939
Go ahead, keep moving, fella.

100
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,570
I'm happy for you, Junior.

101
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,491
I know how long you waited
to be made boss.

102
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,953
Just don't let certain people
take advantage of you...

103
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,705
...like they did to Johnny.

104
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,666
What certain people?
Nobody got over on Johnny.

105
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,085
Nobody's gonna get over on me.

106
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,797
How's your Jewish friend?

107
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,340
Hesh? What about him?

108
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,594
- Whoever heard of a Jew riding horses?
- He owns a horse farm.

109
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,889
He's Tony's friend, not mine.

110
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,686
- What have you got against him?
- Who, me? Nothing.

111
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,771
Johnny liked him.

112
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:47,152
And my son thinks every word that
comes out of his mouth is pure gold.

113
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,991
Are you telling me that since I'm
the new boss, I should tax Hesh?

114
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,458
Boy, Anthony must've really gotten
under your collar. Admit it.

115
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,711
You want to crack his <i>coglioni</i>
for putting you in here.

116
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,089
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

117
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,384
And I'm playing shortstop for the Mets.

118
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,305
All right, watch the balls!

119
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,652
What is the matter?

120
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,697
Tony's cannoli doesn't want to stand up?

121
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,492
Tony's cannoli's tired.

122
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,994
But I can make it happen, baby.

123
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,662
I know.

124
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,956
Just, maybe...

125
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,795
So how's your job?

126
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,338
What?

127
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,215
Since when do you care?

128
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,509
Can't I be nice?

129
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,552
All right...

130
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,013
...forget it.

131
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,143
You don't want to talk? Fine.

132
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,563
Here, go with somebody
who gives a fuck.

133
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm not a fucking whore!

134
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,026
Stick your money up your ass!

135
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,447
- I don't know what's wrong...
- There's nothing wrong with me!

136
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,741
Just wanted to talk, that's all!

137
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,953
Talking with you, I might
as well be a fucking dildo!

138
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,915
If you were a dildo,
we wouldn't be fighting.

139
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,459
What does that mean, you fucking refugee?

140
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,253
What does that mean?

141
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,131
Come here.

142
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,635
Want to fight me? Knock you out!
You fucking communist cunt!

143
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,350
Yeah, same to you!

144
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,479
You fucking burned me!

145
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,275
How you doing?

146
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,654
What do you got, Andrea?

147
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,039
- Clabby?
- Hearts.

148
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,250
Jump in, the water's warm.

149
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,420
Child's play. Pound a point.

150
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,510
- Hesh is outside.
- Tell him to come in.

151
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,014
He says he needs a word with you.

152
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,601
What the fuck?
You eat more queens than Lancelot.

153
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,525
What's up?

154
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,195
- Let's walk.
- That serious?

155
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,867
- You spoke to your uncle lately?
- Junior?

156
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,327
Yeah.

157
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,788
No. I don't know. Why, what's up?

158
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,834
- Your father was a fair man.
- What's that got to do with Junior?

159
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,669
Junior's not so fair.

160
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,632
Sometimes I wish you'd just get
to the point. What'd he do?

161
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,800
He's taxing me, Tony.

162
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,137
He's taxing you?
When did this happen?

163
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,347
Today.

164
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,807
Did you tell him you operate without tax?

165
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,477
That my father loved you
and respected you?

166
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,980
That 10 cents of every dollar
in his kick is from you?

167
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:17,111
My uncle's boss of the family
10 minutes, already I got <i>agita</i>!

168
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,073
What'd you say?

169
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,451
It's a reasonable request
but an unreasonable figure.

170
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,828
What do you mean, reasonable request?

171
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,789
He's the boss now, Tony.

172
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,459
He calls the tune, we dance to it.
That's the way it's done.

173
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,255
You can either respect that
or change the rules.

174
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,509
Tony, I came over here to tell you
with all this bullshit going on...

175
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,386
...I can't stay in this area.

176
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,054
Where you gonna go?

177
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,932
Come on. I consider my royalty checks.

178
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,850
I wrote six gold records.

179
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,852
No, a couple of black kids did.

180
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,606
You just gave yourself a cowriting credit.
Come on, Heshie.

181
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,986
I know you. You leave this,
you're gonna kill yourself.

182
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,282
How much does he want?

183
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,910
500 large. Plus, two points
monthly on my shy.

184
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,581
All right.

185
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,837
Do me a favor, sit tight for now.
Let me think about it for a while.

186
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,564
How was that, baby?

187
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,025
The best.

188
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,986
You are the best.

189
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,114
Come here.

190
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,119
Tony, I love your cannoli.

191
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,706
You okay?

192
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,793
Yeah, I'm okay.

193
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,711
Go back to sleep.

194
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,134
Sure you're all right?

195
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,603
So, what do you want New York to do?

196
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,980
Junior can't know that we talked.

197
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,526
He's gotta think that Hesh came
to you on his own, by himself.

198
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,696
You are still running things.

199
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,535
The arrangement, whatever it is,
can't be insulting to my uncle.

200
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,829
Hesh has got to pay something.

201
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,123
I just haven't decided what.

202
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,507
I gotta get back. We'll talk later.

203
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,764
How's the veal?

204
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,683
It's like rubber.

205
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,560
Yeah?

206
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,607
Tastes all right to me.

207
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,110
Want something else?

208
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,086
Don't look at me.

209
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,714
Compliments of Johnny Sack.

210
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,139
Why don't you spend the rest
of our anniversary with him?

211
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,726
I was over there for 10
frigging minutes, Carmela.

212
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,729
- Don't do this.
- All right, Tony.

213
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,731
At least I know where I stand.

214
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,403
Why do you always gotta be so dramatic?

215
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,739
Oh, here we go.

216
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,743
All right, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,537
You don't even know what
you're apologizing for.

218
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,415
It's our anniversary, Tony.

219
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,627
Ours. Not yours, mine and
Johnny-fucking-Sack's.

220
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,420
Ours.

221
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,424
I thought we could get a room
at the Plaza like last year or...

222
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,551
I don't know. I don't...

223
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,479
I'm sorry, Carmela.

224
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:08,152
I just got a lot on my mind
and I'm not thinking straight.

225
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,114
Hey...

226
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,867
...I'm sorry.

227
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,706
Should I call the Plaza?

228
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,625
Come on.

229
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,878
No, let's go home.

230
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,433
Hey, come here.

231
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,770
Carm, what do you want me to say?

232
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,772
Tell me. I'm lost at sea here!

233
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,651
You've changed, Tony.
And I resent it.

234
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:53,197
It's destroying what little
self-esteem I have left.

235
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,324
Sometimes I think you skeeve me.

236
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,159
I skeeve you?

237
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,912
You're the mother of my children.
How could I?

238
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,331
You see what I'm talking about? There.

239
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:07,670
"You're the mother of my children."
I'm just someone you procreated with.

240
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,965
You know it could be the Prozac.

241
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:15,136
Ginny Torrelli's been on it for years,
and she'd hump a fire hydrant.

242
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,847
Dr. Melfi said it had
different side effects.

243
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,683
Oh. She told you that?

244
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,993
Before we start today's session...

245
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,537
...we need to address the coffee.

246
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,875
It's not appropriate of me to take gifts.

247
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,003
- It's a cup of coffee.
- Let's just make a rule, okay?

248
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,713
No gifts.

249
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,510
- Does this mean I can't drink mine?
- No.

250
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,012
Oh, I'm sorry.

251
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,309
I usually have my answering service on,
but I have a car emergency.

252
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:04,977
Yes?

253
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,065
What does that mean, "diagnostic"?

254
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,902
I just want to know what's
wrong with my car.

255
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,197
No. No, don't do anything.

256
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,158
No, I want to get a second opinion.

257
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,580
I'll take my chances. Thank you.

258
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,334
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

259
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,003
It's all right.

260
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,215
So how's it going?

261
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,508
Good.

262
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,134
Real good.

263
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,555
I think I may flush
the medication, you know?

264
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,974
See if the changes I'm
feeling are for real.

265
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,353
Why would you do that?
The Prozac seems to be working.

266
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,938
That might be the problem.

267
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:53,234
- It might be working overtime.
- What do you mean?

268
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,699
- I'm having a...
- Reaction?

269
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,244
You know, a side effect from the stuff.

270
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,371
We talked about that.

271
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,249
Some people get insomnia.

272
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,794
Others, a stomachache or headaches.

273
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,379
But it usually passes.

274
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,799
But are there any other side
effects that you know of?

275
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,803
Some people experience
a diminished libido.

276
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,140
They have a hard time
getting or maintaining...

277
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,809
- Bingo!
- I see.

278
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:31,147
You know, not all impotence
is a result of the medication.

279
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,568
- There's something wrong with me?
- Have you had a prostate exam?

280
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,404
I don't even let anybody wag
their finger in my face.

281
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,951
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.

282
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,494
Don't apologize.

283
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,164
- Oh, boy.
- You got a nice laugh.

284
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:52,460
- All right, let's be serious.
- Hey. I'm serious.

285
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:58,966
You know that depression is also
a leading factor in impotence.

286
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:04,430
In the morning or at night do
you ever have an erection?

287
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,390
You could set your clock to it.

288
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,935
Okay, so we know it's not
a physical problem.

289
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,780
- Put that in after the credenza.
- Yes, ma'am.

290
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,658
What's going on?

291
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,869
Yeah, I bought some furniture.

292
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,206
Let's just move into Roche Bobois,
save the delivery charge.

293
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,707
Fine, I'll send it back.

294
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,794
No. But you've been spending
like a drunken sailor.

295
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,587
I said I'll send it back.

296
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,381
Mother of Christ,
I didn't say that, did I?

297
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,467
Jesus!

298
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,556
You shouldn't be telling my uncle
how to run things.

299
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:52,394
You think I got the balls to tell your
uncle how he should run things?

300
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,232
I shouldn't expect to see the Statue
of Liberty again if I did.

301
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,070
All right, look, Tony...

302
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:05,407
...Hesh isn't only a friend of you
guys, he's a friend of ours.

303
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,077
Somebody has to step in
so he doesn't get fucked.

304
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,204
I never said, "fucked."

305
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:15,042
You should've come to me first,
airing your dirty laundry in public.

306
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,754
How would it look if I went
to you after I spoke to him?

307
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,589
Now he's got a point.

308
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,550
Bottom line is...

309
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,511
...what are we gonna do?

310
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,852
You have a suggestion?

311
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:37,147
If there are any flies on you,
they're paying fucking rent.

312
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,612
500's a little steep for back taxes, no?

313
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:49,201
The 2 percent of his action,
that's up to you. It affects Tony...

314
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,161
...as much as Hesh.

315
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,081
I'm not out to hurt anyone.

316
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:57,167
God forbid I get in the way
of someone earning.

317
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,630
One and a half on the shy business
and 300 on the back tax.

318
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,798
250.

319
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:12,141
Hold on to your cock when you
negotiate with these desert people.

320
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,312
250.

321
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,231
All right.

322
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,132
Mr. Soprano.

323
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,351
You want sex?

324
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,977
No.

325
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,522
Go back to sleep.

326
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,747
You know, you have a nice body.
You should make it work for you more.

327
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,374
Oh, really?

328
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,709
Yeah, you reveal too much.

329
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,212
You don't want other men looking at me?

330
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:26,131
No, when you're not with me,
you do what you want.

331
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:31,136
But I'm saying maybe you could
wear a nice businesslike outfit.

332
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,389
I think I could get into that.

333
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,724
- You want me to dress like a man?
- No.

334
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,644
I don't want you to dress like a man.

335
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,731
I'm just saying maybe wear something
a little more professional.

336
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,316
Like you're in business.

337
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,736
- Well, fuck you, Tony. I'm no whore.
- No.

338
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,657
That's not what I mean, not like
you're in the whore business...

339
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,200
Oh, forget it.

340
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,080
Come here.

341
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,920
Is everyone in my life bananas or what?

342
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,340
Get over here!

343
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,095
- Come...
- Go jerk off!

344
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,515
Yeah. Go jerk off.

345
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,018
Look at this. She burned me.

346
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,020
That's not good.

347
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,689
What led up to that?

348
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,733
Carmela can be pretty violent.

349
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,529
This added problem
that I've been having...

350
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,616
...I just thought we needed
to spice things up a little bit.

351
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:39,955
If it's not the Prozac, then maybe
I just need a little jump-start.

352
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,584
I suggested that maybe
she dress a little different.

353
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,378
- Something titillating?
- Yeah.

354
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,005
Maybe it'd help.

355
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,050
So I suggested to her...

356
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,593
...not demanded...

357
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,678
...suggested...

358
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,015
...you know, maybe dress a little sexier.

359
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:03,228
- But Carmela can be very sensitive.
- Maybe she felt it degraded her.

360
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,981
Not all women are into sexy lingerie.

361
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,317
It's not about dressing like that.

362
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,152
Then what are we talking about?

363
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:14,448
Some women are sexier
when they dress simple.

364
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,742
You know, understated.

365
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,661
And I don't mean...

366
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,709
Fuck it, I don't know what I mean.

367
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,507
Like you.

368
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,759
How like me?

369
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,511
You play it down.

370
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:42,559
Now, it's obvious you got
a killer body under there.

371
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:43,936
Don't get me wrong.

372
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:48,023
- All right.
- Not only do you play it down...

373
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,486
...but you're gentle.

374
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,072
Not loud.

375
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,366
Sweet-sounding.

376
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,744
Like a mandolin.

377
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:08,502
Anthony.

378
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,887
Unfortunately, we have to stop now.

379
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:22,141
I think it's important
that we talk about this.

380
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,561
Do you think you could come
back later this afternoon?

381
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,855
No.

382
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,443
Till Tuesday.

383
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,238
Okay?

384
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,245
Yeah, all right.

385
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,248
See you Tuesday.

386
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:56,068
It's the oddest thing.
I've had this problem for weeks.

387
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,780
But this morning, I get in
and it starts right up.

388
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,698
And then again at the deli.

389
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,408
Looks fine.

390
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,745
Are you sure?
I was told I need a new starter.

391
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,706
Lady...

392
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:15,170
...as much as I might wish to rob you,
I won't try to replace a new starter.

393
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,214
- What do you mean, "new"?
- New.

394
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,175
It has everything but
the price tag hanging from it.

395
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,725
I didn't do nothing!

396
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,812
Poor kid committed suicide
up here because of you.

397
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,022
- You fucking know me!
- I know you.

398
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:40,445
Listen, big boy. Listen to me,
I'm gonna give you a break.

399
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,865
I'm gonna give you a break.
When I toss you over...

400
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:48,870
...when I toss you over, if you fly,
I won't shoot you down. Deal?

401
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,372
No!

402
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,832
No!

403
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,607
Well, my goodness.

404
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,028
What happened here?

405
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,615
Some sad shit.

406
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,493
Motherfucker said he didn't
want to live no more.

407
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,620
Jumped.

408
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,588
How much you give him?

409
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,480
I thought I was the only one
Junior could make look like that.

410
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,235
All right, let me hear it.

411
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,614
Rusty Irish.

412
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,407
What about him?

413
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,950
Took a header off the Falls.

414
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,870
It's the closest that junkie
ever got to a bath.

415
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,248
I got news for you.
That junkie was my biggest earner.

416
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:19,920
He moved more cards than 10 guys
put together. And another thing:

417
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,632
He should've checked with me
before he did a favor for Capri.

418
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,468
You're losing me.

419
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,221
Irish sold Capri's grandson that shit.

420
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:33,850
- You created a Frankenstein in Junior.
- I created?

421
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,020
We agreed to let Junior have his day.

422
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,191
"Let him be the lightning rod,
and when somebody goes down...

423
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,319
...he's not a young man
with a family." We agreed.

424
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,155
We agreed, but who expected to get raped?

425
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:51,493
When Jackie was boss, it all evened
out at the end of the day.

426
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,413
But your uncle, <i>Madonna</i>,
does he eat alone!

427
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,665
He doesn't even pass the salt.

428
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:02,337
What about Sammy Grigio's card game?
Mikey beat him up. That ain't right.

429
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,215
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

430
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:08,969
Junior had a position.
That game wasn't paying anybody.

431
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,348
The minute Sammy Grigio used Jimmy's
name, it should've been end of story.

432
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,100
That's right.

433
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:21,273
- What do you want me to do?
- We made our bed, we sleep in it.

434
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,317
How long will we kick upstairs
without it hurting?

435
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,446
Something, anything should
trickle down over here, no?

436
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,199
All we want you to do is talk to him.

437
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,869
After all, he's your uncle. Come on.

438
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,454
That's right.

439
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,261
- Who is it?
- It's me, Ma.

440
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,222
- Who?
- Anthony.

441
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,475
Open the door.

442
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:06,067
I thought it was the Activities lady.
She's a real pain in the ass.

443
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,944
Playing bingo, Livia?

444
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,197
Oh, not tonight, honey.

445
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,782
You know, she's a degenerate gambler.

446
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,410
Milly. Milly?

447
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,537
My son.

448
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,998
Handsome.

449
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,635
So how's it going?

450
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:34,179
Oh, what can I say?

451
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,972
Hey, this is great!

452
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:39,809
You only need that broken reading lamp
you had by the phone at home.

453
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,562
And I got it downstairs.
I can bring it.

454
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,730
Listen!

455
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,274
Oh, she's driving me crazy!

456
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,818
- Who?
- Next door!

457
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,445
There it is again.

458
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,785
That's enough water!
How much water does she need?

459
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:01,623
She runs the water all day.
Water, water, water!

460
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,793
I'm living next door to Gunga Din!

461
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,963
I went to Ferrara's. I got you <i>biscotti</i>.

462
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,381
- Almonds?
- Yeah.

463
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,716
All right. Leave them there.

464
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,178
I'll take them downstairs
later for my coffee.

465
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,851
Uncle Jun been by?

466
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:27,148
Oh, once in a while.
It makes him uncomfortable here.

467
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:31,611
He's got a lot on his mind.
More responsibilities means more headaches.

468
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,406
Better men than him had to work hard.

469
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,615
Yeah?

470
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,534
He'll be all right.

471
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,412
If he remembers who his friends are.

472
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:46,293
I'd hate to see him mess up.
He's been waiting a long time.

473
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,752
What do you mean?

474
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,464
It's not a business that
forgives bad decisions.

475
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,801
And I hate to see him making
wrong moves, you know.

476
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:59,639
- Especially at the beginning.
- Why you telling me? Tell him.

477
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,850
Ma, you got his ear.

478
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,185
He listens to you.

479
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,730
I don't know that world.

480
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,648
No, of course not.

481
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,611
But if anything, you know,
were to come up, that's all.

482
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,613
I don't want to get involved.

483
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:18,366
If you have something to say
to your uncle, bring it up to him.

484
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:25,040
- Oh, I wish the Lord would take me.
- Come on, Ma.

485
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,377
There's plenty of nice gents
that want a date with you.

486
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,379
Look. I'm going downstairs.

487
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:36,384
I'm going downstairs before that
<i>che bruta</i> Activities lady finds me.

488
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,386
You want coffee?

489
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,056
- Yeah, all right.
- Bring the cookies!

490
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:46,353
Carmela, I don't want to sound
like religion is a cure-all...

491
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,648
...but if Tony got more
involved with the Church...

492
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:53,193
...it may help to expedite
things in his therapy.

493
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,905
What's killing me is that this
is a self-inflicted wound.

494
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,823
I pushed for it.

495
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,494
I could deal with the <i>goomars</i>.
I knew I was better than them.

496
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:08,124
As stupid as it sounds, I viewed them
as a form of masturbation for him.

497
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,252
I couldn't give him what
he needed all the time.

498
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,422
You're a man. You know that thirst.

499
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,220
I was too busy with the house
and the kids to quench it.

500
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,391
But this psychiatrist...

501
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,310
...you know, she's not just a <i>goomar</i>.

502
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,941
Now I feel like he's really cheating
and I'm the one who's thirsty.

503
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,653
I'm not gonna stay
in a marriage that's made...

504
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,031
Let's not even think about that.

505
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:45,870
Divorce is for those who never intended
on dying married in the first place.

506
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,626
You know, Carm, we reap what we sow.

507
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,129
What do you mean?

508
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,340
You admit to accepting
his dalliances in the past.

509
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,592
<i>Schifosas.</i> They meant nothing.

510
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:04,723
But you said it was like they were
"lightening the workload"...

511
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:08,518
...providing a wife's duty
when you were too busy.

512
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,979
You practically welcomed it.

513
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,525
Now, I want you to pray...

514
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:20,530
...to our Holy Mother, ask her
for guidance and forgiveness...

515
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,117
...so that you can get
through this as a couple.

516
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,122
You're not without sin in this, Carmela.

517
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,459
So she's out of control.

518
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:36,045
She spends money like we're
the Sopranos of Park Avenue.

519
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,591
But you've noticed her.
Which may have been the point.

520
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,180
Look, before we run out of time...

521
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:49,768
...I'd like to discuss what happened
when we were here last week.

522
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,356
How's your car?

523
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,278
Did you steal my car and have it fixed?

524
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:07,285
- We had an agreement, no gifts.
- I didn't want you to get robbed.

525
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,870
It was you.

526
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,082
You had no right to steal my car.

527
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,002
I've been scared to death.

528
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,378
- Why?
- Why?

529
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,049
It's a violation of my privacy.
What else have you done?

530
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,638
Answer me.

531
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,434
I love you.

532
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,062
- Anthony.
- I'm in love with you.

533
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,066
I'm sorry. It's just the way it is.

534
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,068
- Okay. Let me talk.
- No.

535
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,320
It's not the Prozac.

536
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,865
I dream about you.

537
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,785
I think about you all the time.

538
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,079
I can't get excited about other women.

539
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,415
There's nothing else to say.

540
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,211
I love you.

541
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,213
Let me start here.

542
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,550
I know this may be very hard
for you to swallow.

543
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:08,179
But you're only feeling this way
because we've made such progress.

544
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:11,474
- What?
- I've been gentle. That's my job.

545
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,812
I listen. That's what I do best.

546
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,190
I've been a broad, generic,
sympathetic woman to you...

547
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,277
...because that's what
this work calls for.

548
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,867
You've made me all of the things
you feel are missing in your wife.

549
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,661
And in your mother.

550
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,505
You're making me out to be
some fucking mama's boy.

551
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,632
I'm a man.

552
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,885
And you're a woman.

553
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,220
End of story.

554
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,974
And this crap about Freud and...

555
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:57,520
...every boy wanting to have sex with
his mother, that's not gonna fly here.

556
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,064
I didn't say that.

557
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:03,026
I want to make sure we
understand each other.

558
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,486
Yeah, we understand each other.

559
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,074
You don't love me.

560
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,248
You don't want me to come back anymore.

561
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,459
It's quite the opposite.

562
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,504
This is all a byproduct of progress.

563
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,673
Has someone been following me?

564
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,677
Okay, forget it.

565
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,181
I'll see you next week.

566
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,360
All right, let's go!

567
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,655
- Listen, Uncle Junior...
- You could've made the pros.

568
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,200
You could've done it.
You had a swing like Joe D.

569
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,785
- You're crazy.
- What?

570
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,536
You think I'm shitting you?

571
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,957
- I could barely hit .250.
- Because you didn't want it.

572
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,794
Too busy chasing skirt.
Chasing skirt, your average was .500.

573
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,506
- Yeah, what happened?
- What did you want to talk about?

574
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,133
Octavian.

575
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:14,055
- You know, Augustus.
- You fucking with me?

576
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:17,517
No. Octavian became Augustus.

577
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,562
Forget about that.

578
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:26,234
Bottom line: Augustus was a Caesar.
And everybody loved him, right?

579
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,154
- You know why?
- I don't know that I give a fuck.

580
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:34,450
Everybody loved him because
he never ate alone. <i>Capisci?</i>

581
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,412
It was the longest time
of peace in Rome's history.

582
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:41,416
He was a fair leader and all his
people loved him for that.

583
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,168
Is this the one that they
stabbed in the back?

584
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:47,130
No, that was Julius.
Talking about Augustus.

585
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:50,633
He shared his wealth and
all his people loved him.

586
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,677
You said that three times.

587
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,139
I heard it. His people loved him.
What's your point?

588
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,562
Remember when you told me
about the bull and his son?

589
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,940
They're looking out at a bunch of cows.

590
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:10,361
The son says, "Dad, why don't we
run down and fuck one of these cows?"

591
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,946
What did the dad say?

592
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:17,452
The father says, "Son, why don't we
walk down there and fuck them all?"

593
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,206
I told you that?
"Why don't we fuck them all."

594
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,916
That's funny.

595
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,378
Okay, I get your point.

596
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,798
Why all of this fucking
Augustus-Octavian shit?

597
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,383
I don't know.

598
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:36,637
Are you okay? You've been acting
<i>mezzo morto</i> lately.

599
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,182
I ain't seen you like that for years.

600
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:44,020
I'm okay. It's just bullshit stuff.
Don't worry about it.

601
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,690
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

602
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,448
Junior took your 250 and split it
amongst the top five guys.

603
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,366
So he doesn't look greedy.

604
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:58,785
- Smart move.
- Yeah.

605
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,204
Your uncle may be another Harry Truman.

606
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,207
- What's that mean?
- Truman had a big job thrust on him.

607
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:08,711
He didn't want it, but in the end he
made some pretty wise decisions.

608
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,214
Your uncle may be the right man.

609
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,217
I fucking hope so.

610
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,511
I'll tell you, I don't want the job.

611
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,596
Let Junior die from the stress.

612
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,141
That's what gave Jackie
the cancer, God rest his soul.

613
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,852
"Boss." Fuck it, who needs it?

614
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,156
It's nice here.

615
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,701
I can't stand the smell.
The shit, flies all over.

616
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,872
But I could watch them for hours.
There's a kind of beauty to it.

617
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,207
I envy them.

618
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,626
- I wouldn't go that far.
- I would.

619
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:53,714
They got no bills, no headaches,
no family <i>cazzi</i> running around.

620
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,509
One horse likes another one,
they fuck. That's it.

621
00:43:56,759 --> 00:44:00,304
No problems. No hundred questions.
No guilt.

622
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,643
I don't know what I'm talking about.

623
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,896
So Junior split my money
and spread it around?

624
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:12,650
- Yeah.
- Five bosses, 50 a pop.

625
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,985
Not a bad day's pay.

626
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,406
Still, I wish it wasn't your money.

627
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,909
You know, it makes me feel terrible.

628
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:25,872
What?

629
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,419
You old fucking Jew.

630
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,881
Here's my share.
I don't want to profit off you.

631
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,012
Never entered my mind.

632
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,118
Dr. Melfi, there's nothing
there, you know.

633
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,579
You don't have to explain nothing, Tony.

634
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:14,378
In psychiatry, apparently what you're
feeling is not what you're feeling.

635
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:17,381
And what you're not feeling
is your real agenda.

636
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,774
- You're gonna stick with it, right?
- I don't know.

637
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,817
I think you should.

638
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,527
You do?

639
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,950
I was jealous.

640
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:47,036
- I should've...
- Wait, let me finish, Tony.

641
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,624
I've been thinking a lot about this.

642
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,046
I was jealous of her ability to help you.

643
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,342
To be a sort of salvation to you.

644
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,886
I talked to Father Phil and...

645
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,015
...I want to be that woman in your life.

646
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,400
Carm, you're not just in my life...

647
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,528
...you are my life.

648
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:26,575
Come here.

649
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:46,804
I'm no good at speeches.

650
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,057
Owe him a dime, you'll hear
some great speeches.

651
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,269
Shit. Shut up, let me talk.

652
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,229
Go ahead. I was only kidding.

653
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,399
I'd like everybody
to raise their glasses.

654
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,744
Okay.

655
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:15,499
Taught me as much as anybody,
except for maybe my father.

656
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,254
Even if he wasn't my uncle...

657
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,424
...I'd be standing here saying:

658
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,176
"To our new boss."

659
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:27,762
<i>Salute.</i>

660
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:31,932
To Junior.

661
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,185
Junior.

662
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,355
To Junior.

663
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,440
<i>Salute.</i>
