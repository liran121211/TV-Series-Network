1
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,038
Mr. Soprano?

2
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,802
Have a seat.

3
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:49,127
My understanding from Dr. Cusamano,
your physician...

4
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,046
...is that you collapsed.

5
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,008
Possibly a panic attack?
You were unable to breathe?

6
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,136
They said it was a panic attack.

7
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,765
The blood and neurological
work came back negative.

8
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,352
And they sent me here.

9
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,646
You don't agree that you had a panic attack?

10
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,026
How are you feeling now?

11
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,277
Good.

12
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,155
Fine. Back at work.

13
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,701
What line of work are you in?

14
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,161
Waste management consultant.

15
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,380
It's impossible for me
to talk to a psychiatrist.

16
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,968
Any thoughts at all on why you blacked out?

17
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,764
I don't know. Stress, maybe.

18
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,726
About what?

19
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,860
<i>I don't know.</i>

20
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,947
<i>The morning I got sick, I'd been thinking.</i>

21
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,077
<i>It's good to be in something
from the ground floor.</i>

22
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,414
<i>And I came too late for that, I know.</i>

23
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,710
<i>But lately, I'm getting the feeling
that I came in at the end.</i>

24
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,336
<i>The best is over.</i>

25
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,757
<i>Many Americans, I think, feel that way.</i>

26
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,509
<i>I think about my father.</i>

27
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,179
<i>He never reached the heights like me.</i>

28
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,306
<i>In a lot of ways he had it better.</i>

29
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:28,852
<i>He had his people, they had
their standards, they had pride.</i>

30
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,729
<i>Today, what do we got?</i>

31
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,113
Did you have these feelings of loss
more acutely before you collapsed?

32
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,033
I don't know.

33
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,221
<i>A couple months before,
these two ducks landed in my pool.</i>

34
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,517
<i>It was amazing. They're from Canada,
and it was mating season.</i>

35
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,603
<i>They had some ducklings.</i>

36
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,912
<i>My daughter's friend was there
to drive her to school.</i>

37
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,500
- Meadow, your father with those ducks.
- The yard smells like duck poo.

38
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,753
You gotta have more than
just juice for breakfast.

39
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:41,216
You need brain food for school.
Happy birthday, handsome.

40
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,760
- Thirteen.
- He doesn't act it.

41
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,722
The male and female duck made
a home in your pool and did it?

42
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,433
Get out of here! You're so gross!

43
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,061
You want some of last night's <i>sfogliatelle</i>?

44
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,106
- Get out of here with that fat.
- One bite.

45
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,024
How do you stay skinny, Mrs. Soprano?

46
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,864
Him, with those ducks.

47
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:08,034
If you don't like that ramp, I'll build another.
Maybe it's the wood.

48
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,588
Look, they're trying to fly.

49
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,134
- <i>National Geographic</i>, Dad.
- Yeah, super.

50
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,095
- You showed us yesterday.
- This is great!

51
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,725
Now my wife feels this
friend is a bad influence.

52
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,061
It's so cool you're coming to Aspen
with my family at Christmas.

53
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:39,816
Last year I saw Skeet Ulrich,
as close as from where you're sitting.

54
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,943
Miss Meadow, we made a deal.

55
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:46,740
Keep your grades up and your curfew
until Christmas, then you get to go.

56
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,701
- I know that.
- Good morning.

57
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,329
- Hey, Mr. Soprano.
- We're late, Dad.

58
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,831
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Dad.

59
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:06,092
You're gonna be home tonight for
Anthony Jr.'s birthday party, right?

60
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,263
Birdman, hello!

61
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,183
Yeah, yeah.
I'll get home early from work.

62
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,102
I'm not talking about work.

63
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,816
This won't work.
I can't talk about my personal life.

64
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,945
Finish telling me about
the day you collapsed.

65
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,577
<i>I drove to work with my nephew.
He's learning the business.</i>

66
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,288
<i>He's an example of what
I was talking about before.</i>

67
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:39,876
Did you call Triborough Towers
about the hauling contract?

68
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,838
I got home too late.
I didn't want to wake the man up.

69
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,677
Did you get up early and call?
He's always in his office by 6.

70
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,806
I was nauseous. My mother told me
I shouldn't even come in today.

71
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,977
<i>Bear in mind, this is a kid who just
bought himself a $60,000 Lexus.</i>

72
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,944
- There's that guy Mahaffey.
- Get out.

73
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,655
Right there. Next to the boo-boo in pink.

74
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,366
Back up.

75
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,840
My friend Mahaffey pulling his taffy. Hello.

76
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,758
<i>We saw this guy.</i>

77
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,136
There was an outstanding loan.

78
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,554
One second.

79
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,017
I don't know where this story is going.

80
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,480
But there are a few ethical ground
rules we should get out of the way.

81
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,234
What you tell me here...

82
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,738
...falls under doctor/patient confidentiality.

83
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,531
Except if I was...

84
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,828
if I was to hear, let's say,
a murder was to take place...

85
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,080
Not that it would, but if.

86
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,251
If a patient tells me a story where
someone's going to get hurt...

87
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,421
...I'm supposed to go to the authorities.

88
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,923
Technically.

89
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,221
You said you were in waste management.

90
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,098
The environment.

91
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,143
Dr. Cusamano, besides being
your family physician...

92
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,937
...is also your next-door neighbor.

93
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,564
See what I'm saying?

94
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,151
I don't know what happened
with this fellow, I'm...

95
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,195
I'm just saying.

96
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,323
Nothing.

97
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,617
We had coffee.

98
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,744
Alex!

99
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,245
Help!

100
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,962
Security! Help!

101
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,881
Oh, shit.

102
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,652
Asshole!

103
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,157
Tony!

104
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,784
Wait up!

105
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,875
Security!

106
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,026
You all right?

107
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,696
My leg is broken.
The bone's coming through.

108
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:55,989
Let me see.

109
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,742
I'll give you a fucking bone, you prick!
Where's my fucking money?

110
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,162
So you had coffee.

111
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,830
Right.

112
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,749
You son of a bitch, motherfucker.

113
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:15,550
- What are you doing? Get over here!
- That's $3000 here. $3000.

114
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,801
Go ahead.

115
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,598
Where's the fucking money?

116
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,224
I'll get the money!

117
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,726
I know you will.

118
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,229
You should get a cork in your mouth
because you say I'm nothing...

119
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,191
...compared to the people
who used to run things. Prick.

120
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,234
I'm nothing.

121
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,742
Shut up.

122
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,912
What are you crying about? HMO.
You're covered.

123
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,998
You prick.

124
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,085
Degenerate fucking gambler.

125
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,505
<i>- Go on.
- Next, I had a meeting.</i>

126
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,343
<i>I was called in to consult by
a garbage-hauling company I represent.</i>

127
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,595
What's the story with Triborough Towers?

128
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,600
The manager wants the contract
with Dick, but this Kolar Sanitation...

129
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,727
Another nationwide company.

130
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,731
The Kolar brothers. Czechoslovakian
immigrants or some shit.

131
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,984
These Polacks will haul paper,
plastic and aluminum...

132
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,861
...for 7000 a month less than Dick.

133
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,739
They pay us 40 times the monthly
for stealing a stop.

134
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,532
That's the thing. They won't.

135
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:26,246
Says if he can tell the commie bosses
in Czechoslovakia to fuck off...

136
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,289
...he can fucking tell us.

137
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,042
- I give up.
- Fucking garbage business.

138
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,503
Yeah, I know. It's all changing.

139
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,421
Let me see what I can do.

140
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,299
Sure? You over your stomachache?

141
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,468
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

142
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,346
What are you doing here?

143
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,683
Gabriella sends me down here
for the <i>capocollo</i>.

144
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,352
Hey, T, let me ask you something.

145
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,897
Didn't you used to go
to school with Artie Bucco?

146
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,025
A situation came up.
It involves my uncle.

147
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,403
I can't go into details.

148
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,612
That's fine.

149
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,992
But I will say this. My uncle adds
to my general stress level.

150
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,661
It's none of my business...

151
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,747
...but down at the club, the word is...

152
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,001
...your Uncle Junior is gonna
whack Pussy Malanga.

153
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,840
He's gonna do it at Artie Bucco's restaurant.

154
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,436
Hey, boys. How are you?

155
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,023
Don't move.

156
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,858
Uncle Junior, how you doing?

157
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,902
Hey, good to see you.

158
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,696
Hi there, Chris.

159
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:46,034
I was talking about you.
It's Anthony Jr.'s birthday tonight, right?

160
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:50,830
Don't buy him anything big,
we overindulge him. Okay?

161
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,461
- Artie, how's your rash?
- It's itchy.

162
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,754
Come here.

163
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,966
- Good to see you. You'll come over?
- Yeah, have a seat.

164
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,098
You know what it means,
one of these mutts gets wet in here?

165
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,517
It'll ruin his business.

166
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,978
You better sit down with your uncle.

167
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,609
<i>Uncle Junior's my father's brother.</i>

168
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,653
<i>A good guy, just getting old, cranky.</i>

169
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,533
<i>He used to take me to Yankee
games when I was a kid.</i>

170
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,535
<i>I love my uncle.</i>

171
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,539
<i>At the same time, when I was young...</i>

172
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:37,543
<i>...he told my girl cousins I would
never be a varsity athlete.</i>

173
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,671
<i>Frankly, that was a tremendous
blow to my self-esteem.</i>

174
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,321
Who's there?

175
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,739
It's me, Ma.

176
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,450
Who are you?

177
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,953
Ma, open the door.

178
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,043
- Anthony?
- Yeah, it's me. Open the door.

179
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,508
Hi, how are you?

180
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,595
Jeez, Ma. Get some air in here.

181
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,348
Did you lock the door?

182
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,935
- Yeah, I did.
- Somebody called here last night.

183
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,354
- After dark.
- Who?

184
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,190
You think I'd answer?
It was dark out.

185
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,276
Ma, I'll never understand that.

186
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,778
The phone is auditory.
Dark is an eye thing.

187
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,407
I could understand not going out.
You could get jumped.

188
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,783
But the phone?

189
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:55,746
Listen to him, he knows everything.
You want some lunch? I got eggplant.

190
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,208
No, no, I just ate.
Know who I just ran into?

191
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,376
Uncle Jun.

192
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:05,548
Oh, that one. You think he ever
comes to see his sister-in-law?

193
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,050
Remember Artie Bucco?

194
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,344
Kid I went to elementary school with?

195
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:14,098
Oh, yeah, I still see his mother.

196
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,393
She tells me...

197
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,938
...he calls her every day.

198
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,525
Well, Uncle Junior's gonna
make a problem for Artie.

199
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,110
Could affect his livelihood.

200
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,113
- What's that?
- CD player.

201
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,240
For who?

202
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,700
For me?

203
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,952
- I don't want it.
- You don't want it.

204
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:39,165
You love music, all the old stuff's on CD.
Your favorites.

205
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,542
"Pajama Game," Connie Francis.

206
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,835
Here.

207
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,715
Come on.

208
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,009
Move around a bit.
It's good for you.

209
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,015
- Come on. Come on.
- Stop it.

210
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:01,771
You need to occupy your mind.
When Dad died, you were gonna do things.

211
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,858
- He was a saint.
- I know he was. But he's gone.

212
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,986
You were gonna travel, volunteer.
You've done nothing.

213
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,240
Stop telling me how to live my life.
Just shut up.

214
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,242
I just worry...

215
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,370
And don't start with that
nursing home business again.

216
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,457
It's not a nursing home,
it's a retirement community!

217
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,336
You interact with seniors your
own age, go places, do things!

218
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,964
I've seen women in nursing homes...

219
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,883
...in these wheelchairs,
babbling like idiots!

220
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,885
Here, eat your eggplant.

221
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,263
I told you, I already ate lunch.

222
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,226
All right, listen.

223
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,188
You just speak to Uncle Junior
about Artie, okay?

224
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,232
He respects you.
He'll listen to you.

225
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,279
If your uncle has business with Arthur,
he knows what he's doing.

226
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:55,866
And I don't?

227
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,663
Well, all I know is...

228
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,833
...daughters are better at taking
care of their mothers than sons.

229
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,919
Yeah, and I bought CDs for a broken record.

230
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,511
I expect to see you at Anthony Jr.'s
party with your baked ziti.

231
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,723
Only if I'm picked up and I'm
brought back home.

232
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,351
I don't drive when they're predicting rain.

233
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,895
You're healthy.
It's good for you to drive.

234
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,356
Use it or lose it.
I gotta go to work.

235
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,983
Sure...

236
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,943
...run off!

237
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,615
And that night was my son's birthday party.

238
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,618
<i>My wife invites the priest.
He's always at the house.</i>

239
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,077
- Hey, Tony.
- How you doing?

240
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,705
- You like <i>crème anglaise</i>?
- You bless it, I'll eat it.

241
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:43,873
She's not coming.

242
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,916
- Who?
- Grandma just called.

243
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,377
She started crying and hung up.

244
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,380
- She needs a purpose.
- She's tougher than you think.

245
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,050
So, what? No fucking ziti now?

246
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,708
<i>At first it felt like...</i>

247
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,877
<i>...ginger ale in my skull.</i>

248
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,100
- Mom, Daddy just fell! Mom!
- Oh, my God. Tony!

249
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,479
Get back!

250
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,816
Daddy! Dad!

251
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,568
Anthony Jr., call 911.

252
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:11,836
<i>Dr. Cusamano put me in the hospital,
gave me every kind oftest.</i>

253
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,597
Okay.

254
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,062
Hey! Carm.

255
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,861
- Thought you might want some company.
- Yeah.

256
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,406
6:30 in the morning.

257
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,036
- How are the kids?
- They're worried about you.

258
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,207
I told Anthony Jr. we'd
rain-check his birthday.

259
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,092
Think I got a brain tumor?

260
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,428
Well, we're gonna find out.

261
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,639
What a bedside manner.
Very encouraging.

262
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,516
What, are you gonna not know?

263
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,065
We had some good times.
Had some good years.

264
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,234
Here he goes with the nostalgia.

265
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,278
No marriage is perfect.

266
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,322
Having that <i>goomar</i> on the side helps.

267
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,159
I'm not seeing her anymore.
What about that priest?

268
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,744
Don't even go there.

269
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,706
Father is a spiritual mentor.
He's making me a better Catholic!

270
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,626
Well, we all got different needs.

271
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:37,630
What's different between us is,
you're going to hell when you die.

272
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,736
<i>My nephew, Christopher, was handling
the garbage contract problem.</i>

273
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,823
<i>But on this I will also not go into detail.</i>

274
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,591
Emil Kolar.

275
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,802
Chris Moltisanti.

276
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,639
Hey, in Czech Republic too, we love pork.

277
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,766
You ever have our sausages?

278
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:35,521
No, no. I thought the only sausages
they had was Italian and Jimmy Dean's.

279
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,066
See what you learn when you
cross cultures and shit?

280
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,237
My Uncle Evzen doesn't know I came.

281
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,865
If we make any progress, I'll tell him.

282
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:50,119
Hey, we have to make progress, Emil.
We gotta stop the madness.

283
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,289
Business is changing,
we're the younger generation.

284
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,082
We have issues in common.

285
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,835
Emil.

286
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,214
Where'd you go to high school?
Was it Poland?

287
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,800
I'm not Polish.

288
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,053
Czechoslovakian, that's
a type of Polack, right?

289
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,682
We came here when I was 9.
I went to West Essex.

290
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,060
You used to play my cousin
Gregory in football, he...

291
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,355
- Where's the stuff?
- Yes, yes, yes.

292
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,528
The reason for the visit.
We got it all deployed for you.

293
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,781
Taste the wares, Emil.

294
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,159
Emil.

295
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:59,355
The doctors kept me hanging
about the tests, as doctors will do.

296
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,275
So my uncle and I played
a round of golf and had lunch.

297
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,946
You keep mentioning your uncle.
What's the problem?

298
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,656
Who do you think you are?

299
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,076
I'm the person who says
how things go, that's who.

300
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,163
Artie's dinner business is nice,
upscale people from the suburbs.

301
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,748
Don't ruin his life.

302
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,834
Vesuvio is where Pussy feels safe.

303
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,545
He's been eating here all his life.

304
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,631
You kill him someplace else.

305
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,009
You may run North Jersey,
but you don't run your uncle!

306
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,721
How many fucking hours did
I spend playing catch with you?

307
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:40,646
<i>Can we focus more on your immediate family?</i>

308
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:44,608
<i>My wife and daughter were not getting along.</i>

309
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,239
Darn, these laser discs are incredible!

310
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:55,995
Tony watches <i>Godfather II</i>.
He says it looks just like the movie theater.

311
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,580
Gordon Willis. Tony prefers <i>II</i>, not <i>I</i>?

312
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,500
He likes where Vito goes back to Sicily.

313
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,003
With <i>III</i>, he was like, "What happened?"

314
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,505
Where does Tony rank <i>Goodfellas</i>?

315
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,050
What, do you have raccoons?

316
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,928
- Somebody's jimmying a window.
- What?

317
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,515
You have all these security lights,
who would try and...?

318
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,185
Oh, no. Jeez, Louise!

319
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,229
Hold it!

320
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,856
Meadow.

321
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:29,528
I noticed the glass rattles every time
I walk to the laundry room.

322
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,530
Do we have any putty?

323
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,949
Don't give me that.
You snuck out!

324
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,409
What's going on?

325
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,995
You locked my bedroom
window so I'd get caught.

326
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,373
Normal people thought you were
upstairs doing your homework!

327
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,210
You have become a master
of lying and conniving.

328
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,087
I know I'm grounded.

329
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,007
Patrick's swim meet is tomorrow,
and he needed me!

330
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,427
Grounded for this?
Oh, no, you're not grounded.

331
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,806
You're not going to Aspen
with Hunter Scangarelo!

332
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,641
Yes!

333
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,685
But this shit I'm telling you...

334
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,063
...it'll all blow over.

335
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:11,153
Didn't you admit to Dr. Cusamano
that you were feeling depressed?

336
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,416
"Melfi."

337
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,795
What part of the boot you from?

338
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,922
Dr. Melfi.

339
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,383
My father's people were from Caserta.

340
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,135
Avellino.

341
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,472
My mother would have loved it
if you and I got together.

342
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:49,942
Anxiety attacks are legitimate
psychiatric emergencies.

343
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,444
Suppose you were driving
and you passed out.

344
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,154
Let me tell you something.

345
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,491
Nowadays, everybody's gotta go
to shrinks and counselors...

346
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,245
...and go on <i>Sally Jessy Raphael</i>
and talk about their problems.

347
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,164
Whatever happened to Gary Cooper?

348
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,667
The strong, silent type?

349
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,293
That was an American.

350
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,213
He wasn't in touch with his feelings.

351
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:15,175
They didn't realize once they got
Gary Cooper in touch with his feelings...

352
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,844
...they wouldn't be able to shut him up!

353
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,055
So it's dysfunction this and that!
And dysfunction <i>va fangool</i>!

354
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,308
You have strong feelings about this.

355
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,104
I had a semester and a half of college...

356
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,858
...so I understand Freud.
I understand therapy as a concept.

357
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,735
But in my world, it does not go down.

358
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,698
Could I be happier?
Yeah. Yeah. Who couldn't?

359
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,367
Do you feel depressed?

360
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,414
Do you feel depressed?

361
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,130
Since the ducks left...

362
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,632
I guess.

363
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,553
The ducks that preceded
your losing consciousness.

364
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,097
Let's talk about them.

365
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,822
You can't blame T for being pissed.
You should have waited.

366
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,533
That's the last time I show
any fucking initiative.

367
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,869
Imagine how I felt?

368
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,662
T's running down the business...

369
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,207
...I fucking wet a guy
to keep one of our stops.

370
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,919
He's not running it down.
It's just getting harder in New York.

371
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,047
One.

372
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,590
Two.

373
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,175
Three.

374
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,427
Come on!

375
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,222
- This is fucked up.
- What, Pussy?

376
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:47,017
The Kolar uncle is gonna find
the kid dead on one of his bins...

377
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,853
...and get out of our
fucking business? No way.

378
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,147
"Louis Brassi sleeps with the fishes."

379
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,525
Luca Brassi.

380
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,236
- Luca.
- Whatever.

381
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,322
There's differences, Christopher.

382
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,242
From the Luca Brassi situation and this?

383
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:09,164
Look, if the Kolars know the kid
is dead, it hardens their position.

384
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,043
Plus, now the cops are looking
for a fucking murderer.

385
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,586
What do you want to do?

386
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,965
He disappears. He never comes home.

387
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,300
They know, but they don't know.

388
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,845
They hope maybe he'll turn up... if.

389
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,557
Come on. Let's get him.

390
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,393
Got him?

391
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:32,187
Take him to Staten Island, I'll cut him up.

392
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,774
Pussy, you know, with T
collapsing at the birthday...

393
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,903
...what would you do
if he was, like, disabled?

394
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,905
Why would you even ask that?

395
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,618
Our lecture series in action.

396
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,704
Someone from the university discussing...

397
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:52,207
...the novels of, I believe,
Zora Neale Hurston.

398
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,586
Didn't you just read her in school, Med?

399
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,298
It's very nice.

400
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,639
You know, Grandma, this place is neat.

401
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,850
You should really think about it.

402
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,186
This room was renovated last year.

403
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,896
What goes on behind there?

404
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,066
Those doors lead to our nursing unit.

405
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,194
This is a nursing home!

406
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,322
This is a residence, but just in case...

407
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,658
No, you're not getting me
into a nursing home.

408
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,744
You're not listening to what she's saying.

409
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,246
Women in wheelchairs, babbling like idiots!

410
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,081
Ma, you're not listening.

411
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,293
You think you're so high
and mighty, don't you?

412
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,004
With your fancy office.

413
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,466
Anthony, people come here to die!

414
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:51,224
Oh, my God! Somebody get a doctor.

415
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:04,071
So you've come back for help.
Don't look at that as a defeat.

416
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,282
She's one of those who grew up
during the Depression.

417
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,410
But the Depression to her
was a trip to Six Flags.

418
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,204
There's that "D" word again.

419
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,670
Stay with your mother.

420
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,678
Now that my father's dead, he's a saint.

421
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,849
When he was alive, nothing.

422
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,565
My dad was tough, he ran his own crew.

423
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:45,362
A guy like that and my mother
wore him down to a little nub.

424
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,698
He was a squeaking
little gerbil when he died.

425
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,620
Quite a formidable maternal presence.

426
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:02,421
I gotta be honest. I'm not getting
any satisfaction from my work, either.

427
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,922
Why?

428
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,300
Well, because of RICO.

429
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,720
- Is he your brother?
- No. The RICO Statutes.

430
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,306
- Oh, of course, right.
- You read the papers?

431
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,809
You know, the government's
using electronic surveillance...

432
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:20,522
...and various legal strategies
to squeeze my business.

433
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:28,071
Do you have any qualms about
how you actually make a living?

434
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,699
Yeah.

435
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,203
I find I have to be the sad clown.

436
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,540
Laughing on the outside...

437
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,417
...crying on the inside.

438
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,128
See, things are trending downward.

439
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,757
Used to be, a guy got pinched,
he took his prison jolt.

440
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,677
Everybody upheld a code of silence.

441
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:54,181
Nowadays, no values.

442
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,642
Guys today have no room
for the penal experience.

443
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,020
So everybody turns government witness.

444
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,902
I feel exhausted just talking about it.

445
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:12,532
Well, with today's pharmacology,
no one needs to suffer...

446
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:16,286
...with feelings of exhaustion
and depression.

447
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:21,124
Here we go. Here comes the Prozac.

448
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:30,926
Mahaffey doesn't have it.

449
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,886
What do you mean he doesn't have it?

450
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,179
He doesn't have the money.

451
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,722
How can he not have the money?

452
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,183
The man does not have the money.

453
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,894
We ran the man over with the car.
T, himself.

454
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,439
The man has no wiggle room. He's bled dry.

455
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,403
So...

456
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,157
...I hear Junior wants to whack
Pussy Bompensiero?

457
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,077
- Pussy Malanga.
- Oh, Little Pussy.

458
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,579
You think he's gonna fuck with Big Pussy?

459
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,331
My Pussy?

460
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,416
Andrea.

461
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,213
Stay with drinks on the house all night.

462
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,049
- Sorry, Mr. Dante.
- It's okay.

463
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:16,221
So your uncle resents that you're the boss.

464
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,098
The sadness accrues.

465
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,059
Your uncle's had a hard-on his whole life.

466
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,478
First, against your father,
his younger brother...

467
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,522
...because he was a made man before him.

468
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,399
And now, you.

469
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,570
So, sure, he can't stomach
your telling him what to do.

470
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,072
Hesh, I love the man.

471
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:38,034
The man is driven <i>in toto</i> by his insecurities.

472
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,537
I feel bad I was the messenger.

473
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,166
Your friend Artie, with the restaurant.

474
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,043
Get him out of town.

475
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:51,673
That way the restaurant closes,
the hit goes down someplace else.

476
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,552
You old fucking Jew.

477
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,054
No wonder my old man
kept you around so long.

478
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,808
So what about this fucking Jew's
250 on Mahaffey's 100?

479
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,690
Mahaffey has a new business partner...

480
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,191
...you.

481
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,277
These HMOs pay out millions...

482
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,071
...to doctors, hospitals, whatever.

483
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,408
That MRI I had, $2000 a pop.

484
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,910
Now, we give this Mahaffey a choice.

485
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,538
Either his company pays out phony claims...

486
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,999
...to fake clinics we set up...

487
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,629
...or he pays Hesh the 250 grand he owes him...

488
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,089
...which we know he cannot do.

489
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,511
Or it's a rainy night in Lyndhurst.

490
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,058
Very smart. Could be major.

491
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,518
Could be as good as garbage.

492
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,648
- Garbage is our bread and butter.
- Was.

493
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,077
Miss Meadow!

494
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,456
So, Med.

495
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,167
I'm not going.

496
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,546
Every year, on this date,
since you were itty-bitty...

497
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,840
...Mom and Meadow get all dolled up...

498
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:21,054
...drive into New York Plaza Hotel
for tea under Eloise's portrait.

499
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,931
Look, where's yours?

500
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,641
I have too much homework.

501
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,018
Meadow, its our little tradition!

502
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,853
We always have so much fun!

503
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:32,357
To tell you the truth, I felt
it was dumb since I was 8!

504
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,984
I just go because you like it.

505
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:42,742
Here I thought this was something we
would do long after you got married...

506
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,828
...with girls of your own.

507
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,871
Hopefully I won't be living
around here by then.

508
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,124
<i>You've got mail.</i>

509
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:55,839
Meadow, you can't just lie and cheat
and break the rules you don't like!

510
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,052
What? You have something you want to say?

511
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,516
Mom, do you have any idea how much
it means to go skiing in Aspen?

512
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,185
Do you think that'll happen every year?

513
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,856
Like lame tea and scones at the Plaza Hotel?

514
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,403
- Goodbye.
- Close my door, please.

515
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,156
Artie.

516
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:26,119
Give me a drop. Oh! A drop, not a spurt.
<i>Soave</i>, a drop!

517
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,706
- How are you?
- All right. Stir the meatballs.

518
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,584
- Could you help me out?
- Yeah, what do you need?

519
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,753
Cruise. Caribbean.

520
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,922
<i>S.S. Sagafjord</i>, 11th through the 29th.

521
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,341
Pair of tickets. I can't use them.

522
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,427
Can you take them off my hands?

523
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,721
- Where'd they come from?
- Comps.

524
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,182
Comps?

525
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,767
What does that mean?

526
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,770
As manager for the Kitchen
and Restaurant Workers Union...

527
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,398
...I administer the dental plan.
You listening to me?

528
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:59,277
A couple of dentists got together
and awarded me these tickets.

529
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,280
The problem is, I can't get away those dates.

530
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,994
Here. When was your last vacation?

531
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,789
- Anthony, thank you.
- All right.

532
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,798
Mr. Soprano?

533
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,184
You cannot accept a gift like that
from Tony Soprano! No way!

534
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,685
Listen to me, Charmaine...

535
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:36,272
...if I stick my hand up the ass
of one more lobster without a break...

536
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,774
...I'm gonna go postal.

537
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,319
I don't even want to talk
about it anymore, please!

538
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,615
Art, Melissa, come on, honey.
It's time to go home.

539
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:50,161
You have to get away.
We have to get away for the marriage.

540
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:55,416
No! It's bad enough that these
mobsters patronize the place, okay?

541
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,418
So what? We're not connected.

542
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,630
Right. Because we just
turned down those tickets!

543
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,592
But the tickets were comps.
Tony is a labor leader.

544
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,469
Arthur, please. Grow up!

545
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,515
Does the mind not rebel at any
scenario under which dentists...

546
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:15,436
...are sending the don of New Jersey
first class on a Norwegian steamship?

547
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,566
Come on, Arthur, somebody donated
their kneecaps for those tickets!

548
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,778
Herman, there is no way I can
subvert my fucking company.

549
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,115
Have them pay claims for MRIs
that never happened?

550
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,827
- The paperwork will look real.
- How do I not get caught?

551
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,205
I hate to hear you knocking yourself.
You're a smart guy.

552
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:38,167
I'm depressed. I'm so fucking
depressed I can't eat, sleep.

553
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,254
- You on Prozac?
- Zoloft. It's similar.

554
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,798
- It's supposed to help with gambling.
- No shit.

555
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,301
This new generation of antidepressants...

556
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,512
...are supposed to be useful
against compulsive behaviors.

557
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,014
That's a shame.

558
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,808
A medication comes along
after your gambling...

559
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,394
...gets your fucking hip busted to shit.

560
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,855
I'm trying not to be cynical.

561
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:02,984
Your debt and the feelings surrounding
it is the source of all your problems.

562
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,737
I'm sorry I haven't paid you, Herman.

563
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,447
I know you are.

564
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,866
And I never meant to denigrate Tony Soprano.

565
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,660
- Want to walk on the rocks?
- Crutches, I can't.

566
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,872
It's beautiful out there.
Come on, we'll help you.

567
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,749
I go out there to think.

568
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,098
Thanks, but no.

569
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,311
Let's try it.

570
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,273
What you were saying before
with the MRIs and...

571
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,505
T!

572
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,050
Dick's looking for you!

573
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,846
Hey, Tony, I just heard
from Triborough Towers.

574
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:17,183
The Kolar brothers withdrew their bid.

575
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,685
That's good. That's good.

576
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,854
Listen, by the way,
Artie Bucco's here to see you.

577
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,399
- I gotta go, guys.
- Take care.

578
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,990
Artie!

579
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,283
Artie, you all right?

580
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,122
- I can't.
- What are you talking about?

581
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,250
We discussed this.
You gotta leave town.

582
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,751
I'm sorry.

583
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,261
This is unacceptable.

584
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,763
I made a reservation two weeks ago.

585
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:59,976
Sir, people are not leaving, and
there are five parties ahead of you.

586
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,854
- So what would you like...?
- Can I help you?

587
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,400
I tore her a new one.

588
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,404
Why don't we just go
to another restaurant and eat?

589
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,905
We're here.

590
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,575
Mr. Soprano, how you doing?
Good to see you.

591
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,201
How you doing?

592
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,247
This way. Excuse me.

593
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,964
Sweetie-pie, I'm hungry.
Tony, where you going?

594
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,924
Hey. How are you?

595
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,593
Good.

596
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,554
You come here?

597
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,514
When possible.

598
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:43,686
Those decorating tips you
gave me, they really work.

599
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,938
Good.

600
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:48,900
How you doing?

601
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,406
Nils, Nils?

602
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,200
Do you know who that was?

603
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,119
Well, I mean, obviously you do.

604
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,913
What, is he a patient?

605
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,539
You know I can't say.

606
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,338
Decorating tips, yeah, right.

607
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,590
Nils, shut the fuck up.

608
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,843
Mr. Borglund, they're setting up
your table now.

609
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:18,971
Whoa.

610
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,767
Who was that woman at the restaurant?

611
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,435
My decorator.

612
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,105
What? You're redoing the garbage dump?

613
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,650
That's funny. Hey, you better
not mess with that hat!

614
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,948
Come on, it's JFK's hat!
I bought it at that auction.

615
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,366
Give me that!

616
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,327
Irina, Jesus.

617
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,665
I know there is something more
intimate between you and her.

618
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,167
Nothing intimate. We just talk.

619
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,096
Mr. Soprano, <i>buona sera</i>.

620
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,348
We don't see you. Where you been?

621
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,898
You know, sometimes...

622
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,359
...life is good.

623
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,486
Life is often good.

624
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:19,031
Regaleali, for example.

625
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,119
You've been in good spirits
the last couple days.

626
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:36,007
Carmela, there's something I gotta confess.

627
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,012
What are you doing?

628
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:44,015
Getting my wine in position
to throw in your face!

629
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,516
You're always with the drama.

630
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:48,144
Confess already, please.
Get it over with!

631
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,692
I'm on Prozac.

632
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,528
Oh. Oh, my God.

633
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,114
I been seeing a therapist.

634
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,075
Oh, my God. I think that's great.

635
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:06,329
I think that's wonderful!
I think that's so gutsy!

636
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,332
- Take it easy.
- But I think that's very wonderful.

637
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,500
You'd think I was Hannibal Lecter.

638
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:14,337
I think it's great.
Psychology doesn't address the soul.

639
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,422
But this is a start. This is something.

640
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,507
Oh, I'm gonna shut up now.

641
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,593
I'll shut up now.

642
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,845
You're the only person who knows.

643
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,973
The only reason I'm telling you
this is because you're my wife.

644
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,560
You're the only person on this planet
that I'm completely honest with.

645
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,562
Oh, please.

646
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:33,439
Hey, goddamn it, I'm serious.

647
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,942
If the wrong person finds out,
I get a steel jacket...

648
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:38,486
...of antidepressant in the back of the head.

649
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,581
I didn't realize you were so unhappy.

650
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:55,878
I don't know.

651
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,130
My mother...

652
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,174
You told him about your father, right?

653
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,094
- Who?
- Your therapist.

654
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,597
Yeah. Yeah, I told him.

655
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:10,601
Good. But your mother is the one.

656
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:15,982
I don't know, I just feel like lately
my life's out of balance.

657
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:22,280
Our existence on this earth is a puzzle.

658
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,241
My own daughter hates me.

659
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,160
She doesn't hate you, Carm.

660
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,121
We were best friends.

661
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:33,582
Mothers and their daughters.
She'll come back to you.

662
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,839
- Hello?
- <i>Jesus!</i>

663
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,966
What's the matter, no social life?

664
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,676
Blow me.

665
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,262
Dad.

666
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,807
I brought you my primavera.
It's your favorite.

667
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,852
- Who is it?
- Christopher.

668
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,438
- Hey.
- Our friend is back in town.

669
00:46:55,688 --> 00:47:00,443
<i>"Little Pussy" Malanga, sometimes
confused with "Big Pussy" Bompensiero...</i>

670
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,570
<i>...had just returned from Florida...</i>

671
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,780
So it's gonna go down soon?

672
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,991
Don't worry. I got a way to put it to bed.

673
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,453
Come on, Meadow.

674
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:14,040
- Go, Falcons!
- Come on, let's go!

675
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,126
So when do you need this by?

676
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,794
Right away.

677
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,548
- Way to go, Meadow!
- Beautiful, beautiful!

678
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,343
I think I can get a party like that together.

679
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:29,221
- Side out? That ball hit the line!
- What are you doing, ref?

680
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,102
Mom didn't come?

681
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,355
Didn't think you wanted her to.

682
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,690
The car's over there.

683
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,568
Hey, Mr. Dante.
See you, Heather.

684
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,321
You guys played a good game.

685
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,365
Heather Dante. Where'd she get that spike?

686
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:50,326
Don't you think it's unfair
what Mom is doing?

687
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,995
Making this little movie scene out of it.

688
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:56,957
"The Sad Mom Who Can't Even Come
to Her Daughter's Sports Event."

689
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,757
Dad?

690
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,385
Don't you think it's totally out there?

691
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:11,555
I mean, my Aspen trip.
What is she thinking?

692
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,016
Dad?

693
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,191
It's been years since I've been here.

694
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,985
Dad, please talk to her, please.

695
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,988
God, this is so stupid.

696
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,408
Why are we sitting here?

697
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,329
Your mother thinks you have
the capacity to be a top student.

698
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:36,789
And I agree.

699
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,749
What do you guys want, perfection?

700
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,629
What are you looking at?

701
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:47,633
Your great-grandfather
and his brother Frank...

702
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,136
...they built this place.

703
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,012
Big whoop.

704
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:55,474
Stone and marble workers.
They came over here from Italy...

705
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,477
...and they built this place.

706
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,314
Yeah, right. Two guys.

707
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:08,487
No, they were two guys on
a crew of, you know, laborers.

708
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,534
They didn't design it...

709
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,995
...but they knew how to build it.

710
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:21,333
Now find two guys who can
put decent grout around your bathtub.

711
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,331
So I feel good.

712
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,959
So I don't know if I'm
gonna be needing to come back.

713
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,337
It's not the Prozac.

714
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,172
Why not?

715
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:13,552
You said you're thinking clearer and your
wife says you seem to be better?

716
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,889
It's not the medication.

717
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:22,645
Prozac takes weeks to build up
effective levels in the blood.

718
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,564
Well, what is it, then?

719
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,984
Coming here. Talking.

720
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,696
Hope comes in many forms.

721
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,032
Well, who's got time for that?

722
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,660
What is it you want to say to me?

723
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,213
I had a dream last night.

724
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,972
My bellybutton was...

725
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,100
...a Phillips head screw...

726
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,228
...and I'm working unscrewing it...

727
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,939
...and when I get it unscrewed...

728
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,402
...my penis falls off.

729
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:20,077
You know, I pick it up and I'm holding
it and I'm running around...

730
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,747
...looking for the guy who used to
work on my Lincoln...

731
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:26,417
...so he can put it back on.

732
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,878
And you know, I'm holding it up...

733
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:34,049
...and this bird swoops down
and grabs it in its beak...

734
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,885
...and flies off with it.

735
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,933
What kind of bird?

736
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,104
I don't know. Sea gull or something.

737
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:48,689
A water bird?

738
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:53,027
I saw <i>The Birds</i> last week.
Think that planted the idea?

739
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,112
What else is a water bird?

740
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:59,116
Pelican, flamingo.

741
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,493
What about ducks?

742
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,918
Those goddamn ducks.

743
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,130
What is it about those ducks
that meant so much to you?

744
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,056
I don't know, it was a trip...

745
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:26,602
...having those wild creatures...

746
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,856
...come into my pool and
have their little babies.

747
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,740
I was sad to see them go.

748
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,870
Oh, Jesus, fuck. Now he's gonna cry.

749
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:55,381
Shit. Fuck me.

750
00:52:55,589 --> 00:53:00,678
When the ducks gave birth to those
babies, they became a family.

751
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,600
You're right.

752
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,895
It's a link. A connection.

753
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:13,649
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my family...

754
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,818
...like I lost the ducks.

755
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,823
That's what I'm full of dread about.

756
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,493
It's always with me.

757
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,037
What are you so afraid's going to happen?

758
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:29,790
I don't know.

759
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,297
You work so hard.

760
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:41,885
You work so damn hard
and to see your life's dream...

761
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,013
...burn down.

762
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:48,183
Look at it this way,
you collect the insurance.

763
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:51,520
You gotta say to yourself,
"It could have been worse."

764
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:55,482
How could it have been worse?
Fucking faulty stove!

765
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:58,777
Suppose people stopped coming,
ever think of that?

766
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:03,073
I don't know. I don't know what the fuck.

767
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,745
He's right. There's no insurance for that.

768
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:12,666
Why would people stop coming
to the restaurant? It's just catching on.

769
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,086
You know what I'm figuring out lately?

770
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,214
Talking helps.

771
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,550
- That's right.
- He's right. He's right.

772
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:28,307
Hope... comes in many forms.

773
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,100
Absolutely.

774
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,810
Come on.

775
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,022
Here, hold this.

776
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,523
Artie.

777
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,817
Artie, come on.

778
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,780
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

779
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,491
I'll always help you.

780
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,160
Come on. Come on.

781
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,251
Go cook. Hey, let him cook.
He'll feel better.

782
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:12,184
Someday I'll tell him we
torched the restaurant.

783
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,317
All right, enough of this shit.
What's wrong?

784
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:23,320
You know, a simple...

785
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:27,407
..."Way to go, Chris, on the Triborough
Towers contract!" would have been nice.

786
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,034
That's it.

787
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,586
You're right.

788
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:41,421
You're right.

789
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,091
I have no defense.

790
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:49,096
That's how I was parented.
Never supported. Never complimented.

791
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,473
My cousin Gregory's girlfriend...

792
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,852
...is what they call a development
girl, out in Hollywood.

793
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,813
She said I could sell my life story,
make fucking millions.

794
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,816
I didn't do that. I stuck it out with you.

795
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:04,862
I'll fucking kill you. Are you gonna
go Henry Hill on me now?

796
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:08,198
You know how many mobsters are selling
screenplays and screwing things up?

797
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,617
She said I could maybe even play myself.

798
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,411
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

799
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,586
Forget Hollywood screenplays.
Forget those distractions, huh?

800
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,131
What, you think I haven't had offers?

801
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,761
We got work to do. New avenues.

802
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,141
Everything's gonna be all right
from here on in. Come on.

803
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,729
Look, it's a beautiful day.
What could be bad?

804
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:44,568
It's nice of you to pick me up
for the party, Junior.

805
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,864
- At least somebody cares about me.
- These kids today.

806
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,618
I suppose he thinks once he's
got me in a nursing home...

807
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:57,581
...I'll die faster and then he won't
have to drive me anywhere.

808
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,000
If his father was still alive...

809
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:05,005
...you can bet he'd show more
decency and respect for his mother.

810
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,342
Well, my brother John was
a man among men.

811
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,178
He was a saint.

812
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:15,098
Lots of things are different now
from Johnny's and my day.

813
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:16,475
What do you mean?

814
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,186
I'm not free to run my business like I want.

815
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,812
Aw, isn't that awful.

816
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,856
Just this week, your son stuck his hand in...

817
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,233
...and made it 100 times
more difficult for me.

818
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,527
Plus, he thumbs his nose at New York.

819
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:32,115
What are you gonna do?
He's part of a whole generation.

820
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,078
Do you remember the crazy hair?
And the dope?

821
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,621
Now it's fags in the military.

822
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,707
Stop it, Junior. You're making me very upset!

823
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:44,211
I don't like to, Livia,
but I'm <i>agita</i> all the time.

824
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:48,173
And I'll tell you something else,
things are down all across the board.

825
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,717
A lot of friends of ours are complaining.

826
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:54,429
We used to be recession-proof. No more.

827
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:58,225
You can't blame it all
on the Justice Department.

828
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,561
Our friends say to me...

829
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:06,525
..."Junior, why don't you take
a larger hand in things?"

830
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:12,864
Something may have to be done, Livia,
about Tony.

831
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:15,075
I don't know.

832
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,459
There they are. Hey, Ma, Uncle Jun.

833
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:29,506
You're using mesquite.
That makes the sausage taste peculiar.

834
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:33,260
- Hi, Grandma.
- Happy birthday, my big boy.

835
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,886
Carmela, my mother's here.

836
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,597
Everybody, let's eat.
