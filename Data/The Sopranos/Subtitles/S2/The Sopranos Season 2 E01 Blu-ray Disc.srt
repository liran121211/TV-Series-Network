00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,925
Who told you I put my hand on her?

172
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:26,520
ls this kid getting jerky with me?

173
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:30,222
Look, kid, I shouldn't
have to explain myself

174
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:32,185
I'm from the old school

175
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,351
You want to raise your hands
give her your Iast name,

176
00:13:35,543 --> 00:13:37,147
Then it's not my business

177
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:41,816
Until then, keep your hands
in your pockets,

178
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:43,654
We understand each other?

179
00:13:49,515 --> 00:13:51,245
Now get out of here

180
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:53,664
I want to talk to Tony

181
00:13:53,977 --> 00:13:55,625
Go ahead

182
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:07,220
He's a good kid

183
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:10,223
Capable

184
00:14:11,912 --> 00:14:15,226
Look, Ton, this is the thing

185
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,520
I want to get my shy business back

186
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:20,355
I keep getting caIIs
from Jackie's customers

187
00:14:20,507 --> 00:14:24,192
Where the fuck are you going?
-I'II talk to you Iater, Richie,

188
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:27,310
What just happened?

189
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:29,574
No more business talk
with him directly,

190
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,410
You fucking with me?

191
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:33,412
You can talk to him

192
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,390
But not now

193
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:37,542
And never here

194
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,591
Can you believe we drank
a whole bottle of wine?

195
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:49,429
Thank God!

196
00:14:50,242 --> 00:14:52,139
Cheers
Cheers

197
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:54,432
We're out of here
-Gkay,

198
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:57,352
Richie broke a chair over his head

199
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,630
You shitting me?

200
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:02,230
Hit him with a coffeepot too
Broke his cheekbone,

201
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:06,317
Prick, I talked to him yesterday
He's aII sweetness and lights,

202
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:08,446
Already this shit's getting old

203
00:15:11,221 --> 00:15:12,410
Yo, bright eyes

204
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,161
-Where you going?
This isn't the Bing, huh?

205
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:17,498
Fuck did I say?

206
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:19,666
Hey, how have you been?

207
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,629
Can't complain

208
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:28,590
-You Iook good,
Where did your friends go?

209
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:32,176
Tell them to come back, join us
-No, they're leaving,

210
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:34,639
First time here, Excellent veal

211
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:37,101
We making small talk now?

212
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,104
Nice to see you

213
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,772
Yeah, you too

214
00:15:46,382 --> 00:15:48,445
ToodIe-oo
-Bye-bye,

215
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:50,740
Not a bad ass

216
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,491
She had nice pipe-fitter Iips
No disrespect,

217
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:58,360
Hey, what do I give a fuck?
I hardly know her,

218
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:01,790
You mean, you would take
the Iips over the tits?

219
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:05,209
Trust me, my boy,
There's two things I'm good at

220
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:08,338
It's pulling dents
and spotting good blowjobs

221
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:12,218
And that sweetie had
world-class blowjob Iips

222
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:15,138
Am I right, skipper? Good or no?

223
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:18,682
What the fuck do I know?
It was a Iong time ago,

224
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,479
All right, she was good, AII right?

225
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:26,567
Cr great?

226
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:32,404
Why you busting my baIIs?
It was a Iong time ago,

227
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:35,449
Hey, I remember
every blowjob I ever got

228
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,535
You remember your first blowjob?

229
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:41,539
How Iong did it take
for the guy to come?

230
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:44,750
I said, "You remember
your first bIowjob?"

231
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:48,712
Yeah," "How long did it take
for the guy to come?"

232
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,509
ToodIe-fucking-oo"?

233
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:54,762
What the fuck was that?

234
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:57,554
I couIdn't sleep
from the embarrassment

235
00:16:57,705 --> 00:17:01,980
What was so wrong?
It's an accepted form of goodbye

236
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:03,936
That's not the way
I talk with patients,

237
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:07,900
It was Jennifer

238
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:17,281
What did you see at that table
that made you want to hide "Doctor"?

239
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:18,868
Who were you hiding from?

240
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:25,206
That's who I was hiding from
A patient,

241
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:27,335
When you say "see

242
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:31,212
do you mean professionally
orjust plain "see"?

243
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:34,383
-What's the difference?
There's a big difference

244
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:37,969
If it was just a matter
ofjust plain old "see",,

245
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,889
,,,the cordial doctor
wouId've said, "Good night

246
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:49,271
,,you abandoned the doctor facade
and adopted the Jennifer posture,

247
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:51,402
Hence, "ToodIe-oo

248
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:54,361
You're almost there
Elliot, but not quite,

249
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:58,198
Young girls are not accountable
for their behavior,

250
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:02,284
I think "ToodIe-oo" was the action
of a ditsy young girl,

251
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:07,873
And I regressed into the girl thing
to escape responsibiIity,,,

252
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:20,427
Look, I need you as a colleague
to tell me that I did the right thing

253
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:24,265
You gotta ask yourself
why you became a psychiatrist

254
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,769
If it was to help people stop
smoking or biting nails,,,

255
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,688
,,,then so be it,
There's nothing wrong with that

256
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:34,900
Another patient committed suicide
because I was treating this man,

257
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:40,281
Treating patients from a motel room
isn't optimum,,,

258
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:43,750
but you were there for her
in phone contact,

259
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:46,790
It would have been the same
if you'd been on vacation,

260
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:50,711
Did you say "Iam"?

261
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:56,131
(YCGA INSTRUCTCR )
And lifting up into Cobra,

262
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:05,980
And now rising up
into Downward Facing Dog

263
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:29,667
Richie

264
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:34,503
Janice, You know,
I thought that was you

265
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:35,840
Parvati

266
00:19:36,821 --> 00:19:40,900
I changed my name to Parvati in '78

267
00:19:40,158 --> 00:19:42,512
I thought you lived in California now

268
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,765
Seattle, actually, Iast couple years

269
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,769
So, how Iong you been,,,?
-Gut ofjail?

270
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,606
Cne week, That's where
I picked up this yoga shit,

271
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:57,260
It's working, You seem very supple

272
00:19:57,424 --> 00:19:59,529
I'm doing a Iot of stretching

273
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,822
-So you back now?
l\/Iy mom's at St, Erasmus, A stroke

274
00:20:10,607 --> 00:20:14,333
Guess we're aII getting a Iittle old
-Cnly if that's our choice,

275
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:30,227
Drag me aII the way out here

276
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:34,104
I walk through the food court,
this kid spills fried rice on me

277
00:20:34,255 --> 00:20:37,898
Take it easy,
Keep your voice down, Let's talk

278
00:20:45,557 --> 00:20:48,577
I don't talk business,
Don't take it personal

279
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:50,455
I'm a government target

280
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:53,539
Why do you think we're meeting
in a fucking mall?

281
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:57,710
It feels disrespectful,
You know, that's aII I'm saying

282
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:04,468
When? When did you ever
step in for me?

283
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:05,722
You forget?

284
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:09,550
You and my brother stuck up
Feech LalVIanna's card game?

285
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:10,684
Feech was a made man

286
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:16,311
If it wasn't for me, you wouId've got
a vicious beating, to say the Ieast,

287
00:21:16,503 --> 00:21:17,941
You know I Iove you

288
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:24,362
What was yours before you Ieft
will be yours again,

289
00:21:24,512 --> 00:21:26,616
You just gotta give us some time

290
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:30,286
Jeez, Anthony, you'd do that for me?

291
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:32,623
Hey, fuck you

292
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,460
What's mine is not yours to give me

293
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,129
Hey, prick, you reached out to me
-I said what I wanted to say,

294
00:21:46,116 --> 00:21:48,179
Well, we got a problem, kid?

295
00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:50,974
I'm trying to get you to slow down

296
00:21:51,124 --> 00:21:55,309
Things are different now,
You gotta be extra, extra careful

297
00:21:55,501 --> 00:21:57,771
When do you know me not to be careful?

298
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:59,240
VVhen?

299
00:21:59,966 --> 00:22:04,317
You been out of the can 10 minutes,
you shake down Beansie for a piece

300
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:08,310
Do me a favor, back off
He's a good earner,

301
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:10,770
Yeah, for you

302
00:22:10,307 --> 00:22:12,494
That's none of your fucking cazzi

303
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:15,996
Those joints are a cash business
They come in handy,

304
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:19,000
He's a sneaky cocksucker
-Whatever, back off,

305
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:22,379
You taking the side
of a civilian over me?

306
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:25,700
Christ, I'm asking you
to do me a favor,

307
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:28,426
Do it if you want to,
If you don't, go fuck yourself

308
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:31,140
Ch, yeah?
-Yeah,

309
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:38,610
There's no need for that talk
-What?

310
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,899
l\/ly sister

311
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:43,443
Janice, How's she doing?

312
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:50,155
Ch, I thought you were baiting me
You know ,,,,

313
00:22:50,348 --> 00:22:52,284
How's your sister?
Fuck your mother,

314
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:05,651
See what she did?

315
00:24:06,256 --> 00:24:07,986
-Who?
lVIeadow

316
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:09,655
That house is fucked!

317
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:14,310
-Thought you didn't swear,
What are you talking about?

318
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:17,952
I'm outraged,
No, I am beyond outraged

319
00:24:18,104 --> 00:24:22,800
Talk about disgrace? Disrespect for
other peopIe's property?

320
00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:24,460
It's like a freaking
shooting gallery,

321
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,171
It smeIIs of urine, there's puke
aII over the hardwood floors--

322
00:24:28,322 --> 00:24:31,756
Sounds Iike your place in Venice
-She's been punished,

323
00:24:31,907 --> 00:24:33,470
Three weeks without a card

324
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:36,950
Ch, Madonna,
that's some heavy shit there!

325
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:38,556
-Janice ,,,,
If that was my child

326
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:41,976
You got a Iot of fucking baIIs
you know that?

327
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:45,439
Don't talk to me Iike that
-Let's clear the air here,

328
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:48,566
You're a Vishnu-come-lately
playing concerned,

329
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:50,445
Who the fuck are you kidding?

330
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:52,905
You're here to pick
the frigging bones,

331
00:24:57,723 --> 00:24:59,621
A Iot of baIIs

332
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:03,875
Temper tantrums

333
00:25:07,988 --> 00:25:12,422
You're passing judgment on him, Janice
Cn us as parents,

334
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:16,678
How we discipline our children
is none of anybody's business,

335
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:20,222
You Iet that girl walk aII over you
you'll regret it,

336
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:23,892
lVIother of God, Janice!
Are aII of you Sopranos the same?

337
00:25:27,712 --> 00:25:29,275
lVIaybe you'II hear this

338
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:33,192
lVIind your fucking business, Keep your
mouth shut when it comes to my kids!

339
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:34,270
Alright ?!
