00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:13,219
(SQPRANOS THEME SONG)

2
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:46,267
Gur undergrad student body at Brown
only numbers about 6000 people.

3
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,939
That's from every state in the country
and over 60 countries in the world.

4
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:58,363
So again, get all of your academic
and extracurricular ducks in a row.

5
00:01:58,513 --> 00:02:00,910
Leave nothing to chance

6
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:10,545
Hey, buddy

7
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:11,964
Davey

8
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:15,470
Saw your wife alone.
I figured you for the trotters

9
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,593
Not tonight.
I had a customer I couIdn't shake

10
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:20,596
Guy spends half an hour

11
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:23,846
deciding between a $20 soccer ball
and a $22 soccer ball.

12
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:25,644
Who do you like?

13
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:29,102
That guy from Bowdoin seems
to be making some sense.

14
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,650
No, I mean the game tonight

15
00:02:31,462 --> 00:02:32,901
Ho,ho,ho!

16
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:35,736
You guys want to be alone?

17
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:39,612
( Davey ) I saw that refreshment table
I knew you'd be around.

18
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:41,783
How do I get roped into this?

19
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:46,285
Charmaine knows with your sfogliatelle
her daughter can go anywhere.

20
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:51,291
The janitor's the only one near them
-That's a nice career for a lady.

21
00:02:51,982 --> 00:02:53,463
Fuck you

22
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:56,963
I gotta get one of them belly bombs
-Have I said "fuck you" yet?

23
00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:05,473
Delicious, Artie.
Glad I didn't eat tonight

24
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,892
Thanks, Davey. It's nice
to be appreciated by your friends

25
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:10,397
The sensitive chef

26
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:12,897
Hey, Eric, they all done?
-Iguess.

27
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:18,526
-You like this?
Did you think he was gonna say

28
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:22,864
Gee, Dad, thanks for taking the time
to come to this important event"?

29
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:26,360
How you doing, Eric?
-Good, IVIr. Soprano.

30
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:29,330
-You want something to eat?
No, we're going to Starbucks

31
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,833
You're thinking of going to Brown?

32
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:34,960
Yeah, it's a good school.
A lot of star-fucking though

33
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,256
Hey, Iatrine lip
-He's right.

34
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:39,840
He'II go where his mother says
like his old man.

35
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:41,928
You too?

36
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:46,570
Yeah, I've heard

37
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:49,160
And now they're like Phil Donahue
and Alan Alda.

38
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:55,192
Listen, I heard

39
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:58,151
...through the grapevine
you took your uncIe's game

40
00:03:58,341 --> 00:03:59,987
You know, the big one

41
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:02,740
Grapevine?
-Yeah.

42
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,617
If you listen close, that song says

43
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:07,701
Believe none of what you hear
and half of what you see."

44
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:10,247
You know me. I like to play a little

45
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:11,666
A little?

46
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:14,167
Forget it. This game's not for you

47
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:18,337
No, it's just, you know,
I was thinking it'd be a kick

48
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,920
David, you're a nice guy
I like you. Gkay?

49
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:26,177
Trust me, this game's not for you
I don't want to see you get hurt.

50
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:28,557
These guys, they play deep

51
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:33,351
Know how many jockstraps I sell?
-Not enough for this game.

52
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:35,273
Gkay? Forget it

53
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:40,317
Come on. Let's go see what the
Y.0. from BuckneII's got to say.

54
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:51,288
Believe me, you don't want to know

55
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,794
You want to know what I'm thinking?
Seriously?

56
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:05,468
I'd like to smash
your face into hamburger

57
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:07,847
Gkay

58
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,476
I'm not

59
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:14,646
Don't worry

60
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:17,772
I know I broke
your coffee table and

61
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:19,816
It's not gonna happen again

62
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:25,862
But you'd like to smash my face
-Not really.

63
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:32,202
IVIaking hamburger out of me
would make you feel better?

64
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:34,165
Is this a woman thing?

65
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:37,625
You ask me how I'm feeling
I tell you how I'm feeling.

66
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,920
And now you torture me with it?

67
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:43,546
I don't know who the fuck
I'm angry at. I'm just angry, okay?

68
00:05:48,202 --> 00:05:51,889
\/\/hy the fuck am I here?
I even asked to come back

69
00:05:55,794 --> 00:05:58,270
Who makes you feel like a loser?
Your mother?

70
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:01,356
Please, we wasted
enough oxygen on that one

71
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:08,487
I see some guy walking down the
street, you know, with a clear head

72
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:12,325
You know the type, he always whistles
like the Happy-fucking-Wanderer.

73
00:06:12,518 --> 00:06:14,829
I just want to go
and rip his throat open

74
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:22,670
Why should I care
if a guy's got a clear head?

75
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:24,590
I should say, "Good for you

76
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,551
Let's get back to smashing my face
-Jesus Christ.

77
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:31,390
A

78
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:42,440
All right. Sometimes I resent
you making me a victim.

79
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:43,610
That's all

80
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:46,443
I make you feel like a victim?
-Yeah.

81
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:49,530
Remember the first time
I came here I said...

82
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:53,700
the kind of man I admire is Gary
Cooper, the strong, silent type.

83
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:57,495
And how all Americans are doing
is crying and complaining.

84
00:06:57,688 --> 00:06:59,998
A bunch of fucking pussies
Fuck them!

85
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,377
And now I'm one of them, a patient

86
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:05,253
Your parents made it impossible
for you to experience joy.

87
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:06,966
See? There you go again

88
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:09,592
You said you're not
the Happy Wanderer

89
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,595
I'm more like one of them

90
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:15,390
...than I am the jerkoffs
I see leaving this office!

91
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,190
Stop with the faces already
What do you got?

92
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,106
Three eights full. Santa IVIaria, yes!

93
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:25,650
Santa IVIaria? IVIore like Santa Claus

94
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:27,944
Did you cut the pot?
-Twice.

95
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:31,321
Here. IVIake sure you spend it
in my restaurant, you prick.

96
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:38,370
-That's it, I gotta go.
Come on, another hour

97
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:41,456
I can't. Charmaine'II have
my balls on the menu tomorrow

98
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:43,751
-Cash me out.
Look at all the money!

99
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:47,870
Rich, can I get another dime?
-We only got three players.

100
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:48,966
Vito's up for it, right?

101
00:07:49,157 --> 00:07:53,135
Where the fuck do I gotta be?
Cnly, Iet's up the ante.

102
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:56,473
You're into me for seven G's already

103
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:59,725
That's all? I'II make that back
from Vito in an hour.

104
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,521
Count this ciucio out another dime

105
00:08:25,274 --> 00:08:36,680
(EvERYoNE s|No|No)

106
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:41,170
Well, we have our work cut out for us

107
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:41,937
Gudren?

108
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:53,865
(s|No|No)

109
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:01,331
IVIeadow?

110
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,833
I'd like to talk to you

111
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,751
It really sounds good.
I know you're disappointed

112
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:12,838
When you try out, the form asks
what you want and I checked "soIo

113
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:20,140
Gudren hasn't had a solo.
I like to give everyone a shot

114
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:23,850
IVIrs. Gaetano, I was a sophomore
when I did Spider Woman.

115
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:31,901
-You okay with this?
Do I have a choice?

116
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:38,239
You know I'm under fucking house
arrest, you cute fuck.

117
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:40,536
Then take it and be happy

118
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:43,538
Either way, I'm having
the executive game.

119
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,207
Your father and me started
that game 30 years ago.

120
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,126
We were talking one day
about how credit card companies

121
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:51,589
work their angle

122
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:55,131
They didn't care what you bought
if you don't pay all at once.

123
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:58,468
They juice you, you thank
them for letting you have a card

124
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:00,930
You'd rather be juiced
than pay at once.

125
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,560
That's why we call it
the executive game.

126
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,771
IX/ly brother Johnny was keen

127
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:11,815
Ch, yeah. That's why he left us
with cici beans.

128
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:14,527
You don't know
what you're talking about

129
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:18,738
Your father left Livia with a package
that could choke a fucking elephant.

130
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,411
I gotta tell you?

131
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:26,412
She's like a woman with a ham, crying
the blues because she has no bread.

132
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:30,208
Please. They don't make them
like Johnny.

133
00:10:30,402 --> 00:10:33,544
Keep in mind that he paid freight
for your Uncle Ercole, buon'anima

134
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,632
That was a major fucking nut

135
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:38,593
Who? Who the fuck is Ecle?

136
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:40,971
Keep thinking you know everything

137
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:44,970
Some are so far behind in a race
they believe they're leading.

138
00:10:44,456 --> 00:10:46,851
Yeah, that's cute.
Who the fuck is Ecle?

139
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:51,647
No, you opened this clam
Who is he?

140
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,191
You don't know him.
It's water under the bridge

141
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:57,944
IX/Ie and your father looked out for him
He wanted for nothing.

142
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,449
I don't have time for this shit

143
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:03,867
He was my younger brother,
between me and your father in age

144
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:10,625
Hercules, named after my grandfather

145
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:16,256
What are you saying?

146
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:24,929
Yeah, we had a brother you
didn't know about because he was

147
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:30,854
It was different in those days

148
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:39,654
But God bless your grandmother

149
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:42,864
She went to every charity home
in this fucking state...

150
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:49,162
Are you saying he was retarded?
-Why don't you go fuck yourself?

151
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:50,500
He was slow

152
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,834
He was strong as a fucking bull
handsome like George Raft.

153
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:59,756
If it was today, they might
have trained him to be a whatever

154
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:01,720
Get him ajob

155
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:05,540
They didn't understand
these things back then.

156
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:07,768
Jesus

157
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,519
What were we thinking?
-Un-fucking-believable.

158
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:17,565
I remember my mother and father
arguing about-- I don't know.

159
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:23,573
I thought she meant you

160
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:34,430
Not long before your father

161
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:37,378
Past is the past.
This is the present

162
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,297
Let's talk about this game
What's my end?

163
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:45,301
I don't know. Ten percent
-Twenty.

164
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:48,850
Fifteen

165
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:53,434
Call your friends.
Let them know the game's happening

166
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:01,360
(DooR oPEN|No AND cLos|No)

167
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:06,908
Can I help you with something, sir?

168
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,331
What?
-Kid...

169
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:16,820
...you see me here every week.
When are you gonna stop asking?

170
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:17,837
Ho, Rich!

171
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:23,465
-Is there a problem?
I'm just breaking your kid's balls

172
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:33,267
Like the pimp says to his hos
"Keep them coming."

173
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:37,812
Rich, that enveIope's two C's shy
I'II catch up on it next week.

174
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:40,565
It's no problem.
I just got caught off guard

175
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,444
I took a second on the house,
didn't calculate it into my budget

176
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:48,114
-No good, Davey.
It's just a stutter step. No biggie

177
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:50,909
The difference gets tacked
on to the principal.

178
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:53,913
-And you know that
Yeah, I understand

179
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:56,625
Now don't take this personally

180
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:04,132
Come on, Rich. That's not necessary

181
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:07,259
You think I started this life
ten minutes ago?

182
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:11,428
A guy hands you a light envelope
it's just the beginning.

183
00:14:11,745 --> 00:14:12,850
Nothing personal

184
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:16,180
I know, but it'sjust this
-I know.

185
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:18,731
It's just a stutter step

186
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:30,868
Is it fishy?
-It's fish.

187
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:42,168
-You want something?
Give me enough of that for 15 people

188
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:44,173
And ten pounds of shrimp

189
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:55,764
There's gonna be some serious money
This is no nickel-and-dime shit.

190
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,894
These motherfuckers can play
for two days straight.

191
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:06,670
and that fucking place looks
like an operating room.

192
00:15:06,342 --> 00:15:08,529
You mean we're, like, cleaning guys?

193
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:13,159
What are you doing?
Something ain't right.

194
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,702
I saw you put
your finger on the scale

195
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:19,455
-No, I didn't.
Pull that with old ladies, not me

196
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:21,877
I didn't put my finger on the scale

197
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:25,880
Where you going? Wrap that up!

198
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:28,715
-I gotta weigh--
You gotta what? Rob me?

199
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:40,479
That reminds me

200
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:44,272
Whatever you do, don't engage
Silvio in conversation.

201
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:46,984
He can be a sick fuck
when he's gambling.

202
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:51,780
Cnce he was down 50 large.
He sneezes, Fritzi says "saIute

203
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:54,410
Fritzi Neste from Hoboken?

204
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:56,770
Yeah, you know him?
-No.

205
00:15:56,227 --> 00:16:00,790
Then shut up and let me finish
Anyway, Fritzi says "saIute."

206
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,292
Silvio thinks he said something else

207
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:06,836
For the rest of the night, Silvio
blamed Fritzi for his losing streak

208
00:16:07,363 --> 00:16:10,900
What did he think he said?
-Are you listening?

209
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,900
He's a fucking nut. Who knows?

210
00:16:14,742 --> 00:16:15,932
Here

211
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:18,433
I didn't put my finger on no scale

212
00:16:18,582 --> 00:16:21,768
Put that shit in the trunk
so it don't stink up the car

213
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:23,689
Pay for the fish

214
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:30,735
Is this guy for real or what?
We're fucking piss boys?

215
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:33,447
Come on, Iet's get
the fuck out of here

216
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,308
And the two rooms on the sides
We may be here for some days

217
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,561
You people are ruining this place
-That's your father's fault.

218
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,149
He made the deal

219
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,567
We want a lot of clean towels
and the bathrooms fresh-smelling

220
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:14,322
I should work for nothing?

221
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:23,666
You ever suck his dick?

222
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:29,962
I make that beanie spin
when I work his thing.

223
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:32,341
Am I right?

224
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:37,722
Don't bitch to me

225
00:17:40,787 --> 00:17:42,560
(s|RENs)

226
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:03,705
What do you say?

227
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:05,832
License and registration

228
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:09,127
How about this instead?

229
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:10,753
I'm wearing a vest
-Ch, yeah?

230
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:14,173
If I shoot, it's going
in your braciola.

231
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,385
You're a real sick fuck

232
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:18,950
(LAUGHING)

233
00:18:18,116 --> 00:18:19,806
Danny-boy!

234
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,765
How's the family?
-Not bad, Paulie.

235
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:25,725
We had to move my father
to another old foIks'--

236
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,605
I got my own fucking problems

237
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:34,570
Here

238
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:36,696
Listen. Do me a favor, right?

239
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:38,240
Your friends

240
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:43,750
.players or no, they don't fuck with
the tourists and the hotel guests.

241
00:18:43,268 --> 00:18:45,663
No gunshots or we gotta take the call

242
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:48,834
Go play cops and robbers

243
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,296
IVIake it four

244
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:54,470
Change coming to you

245
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,716
Mike

246
00:18:56,448 --> 00:18:59,843
-Hey, IVIike.
IVIatt, Tony wants you

247
00:19:01,954 --> 00:19:05,181
-Yeah, T?
Tony. Got the IVIacanudos?

248
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,517
-Yeah, you want one?
Give one to me, one to Dr. Fried

249
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:15,778
Gentlemen? Frank?

250
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:17,780
Yeah, I'm in

251
00:19:18,843 --> 00:19:19,949
IX/Ie too

252
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:24,494
Four hundred to you, Sil

253
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:28,622
What's in the pot?
-About 2400.

254
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:32,958
Too soon to chase an inside straight
-Doc?

255
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:34,839
Ca

256
00:19:37,197 --> 00:19:39,465
IVIacanudos, you want one?
-Go ahead, take a walk.

257
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:43,136
Don't let him scare you.
He's not really a nasty fuck

258
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:45,181
He's an incredibly nasty fuck

259
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:47,808
Hey, chair-boy of the board
read your cards.

260
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:50,102
Four hundred to you, John

261
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:54,897
Shakespeare's straightening out.
Paulie doesn't have shit as usual

262
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,486
And the prick doctor may be flushing

263
00:19:58,678 --> 00:20:02,821
Put the TV trays out between each
player. Put some of this on them.

264
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:06,784
Don't give anyone booze unless
they ask for it, all right?

265
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:16,837
-Do I know you?
Yeah, you know me

266
00:20:16,986 --> 00:20:19,340
I own Ramsey's Sports and Cutdoor

267
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:38,524
Davey, what're you doing here?
-I was driving by.

268
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:40,987
I thought I'd stop and say hello

269
00:20:41,428 --> 00:20:44,364
-Some place you got here.
Yeah, a regular Taj IVIahaI

270
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:47,907
-Heard the kids?
Bad enough she took me to the play

271
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,120
I never want to hear that song again

272
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:51,957
Eric's only light in the arts

273
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:55,999
His performance will put him over the
goal line at schools he's applying to.

274
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:02,490
So, what's the game?
-Seven card.

275
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:04,217
Was that Frank Sinatra, Jr.?
-Yeah.

276
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:07,178
He's a friend of my uncIe's
He flies in.

277
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,391
Wow! This really is
an executive game.

278
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:14,610
-So, what do you think?
There's a resemblance.

279
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:16,897
No, I mean the game.
Could I take them or what?

280
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:22,318
What are the chances of me getting
close to a game like this again?

281
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,822
-Let me sit in once.
I don't do business with friends

282
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,908
You understand

283
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:30,242
Do I have to show your prom picture
to these guys?

284
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:34,580
I appreciate your position,
but come on, Tony, I'm a big boy

285
00:21:34,732 --> 00:21:36,790
-What are you holding?
I didn't expect to gamble tonight

286
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:40,878
-You need five G's just to sit in.
Can't you float me, short-term?

287
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:46,679
All kidding aside

288
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,929
You understand what I'm saying?
-Yeah, of course.

289
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:52,349
Hey, you don't have
to explain business to me

290
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:10,240
Christopher, say hi to Davey Scatino
-How you doing?

291
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:14,204
Give him five boxes of ziti
Good luck.

292
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:22,464
(sNoR|No )

293
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,427
So there's a lot of money
in sporting goods?

294
00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:31,140
Yeah, but I tell you

295
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,150
Nike has its stores, the NBA has
its stores, it cuts in.

296
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:39,395
It's just temporary, though.
I got some ideas for next year

297
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:41,898
Hey, Davey. Ask the doc
what his specialty is.

298
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,569
-Hard-ons.
I wanted him to ask

299
00:22:45,926 --> 00:22:47,863
-Really?
Penile implants

300
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:54,453
Pot's right.
Sixth Street, here we come

301
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:55,998
No help

302
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:57,999
IVIysteries abound

303
00:22:58,146 --> 00:23:00,209
Shut the fuck up and deal

304
00:23:00,357 --> 00:23:01,753
Nine of spades, thank you

305
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:03,881
Six of clubs

306
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:11,846
What's the bet?
-Eight hundred.

307
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,391
What the fuck could you have?
-Incredible luck.

308
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:18,520
You're telling me, you fuck

309
00:23:19,835 --> 00:23:21,105
-Bet?
Don't rush me

310
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:23,525
You been rushing me all night

311
00:23:23,675 --> 00:23:26,609
He didn't study this hard in school
-The bet's not to you.

312
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:30,239
Good. The dealer controls the game

313
00:23:30,432 --> 00:23:34,116
Do you fucking mind?
Jesus, do you ever shut the fuck up?

314
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:35,953
Blow that smoke somewhere else!

315
00:23:38,938 --> 00:23:41,291
What are you doing?
-Take it easy.

316
00:23:41,484 --> 00:23:45,440
I'm losing my balls over here
and this moron's playing Hazel!

317
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:46,715
Get out of here!

318
00:23:46,904 --> 00:23:48,925
I was trying to sweep the cheese

319
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:59,434
He's sweeping the cheese
I'm trying to--

320
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:03,437
Leave the cheese there!
I love fucking cheese at my feet

321
00:24:03,588 --> 00:24:06,240
I stick provolone
in my socks at night

322
00:24:06,215 --> 00:24:08,443
...so they smell like
your sister's crotch!

323
00:24:08,677 --> 00:24:13,447
All right? So leave the fucking
cocksucking cheese where it is!

324
00:24:13,597 --> 00:24:16,160
Here. Here. Here
Go ahead!

325
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,288
Have a good time

326
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:26,920
Why don't you go fix a fucking dick?

327
00:24:27,612 --> 00:24:30,257
Doctor Fried, you know
about that Viagra shit?

328
00:24:30,406 --> 00:24:32,930
He won't quit, this fucking guy

329
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:37,960
I heard they're sinking a crate of it
to the Titanic to try and raise it.

330
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:39,475
Very good, very good
-All right.

331
00:24:39,622 --> 00:24:41,228
Down and dirty

332
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:44,210
Last card, automatic 12 hundred bump

333
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:46,857
Kings rule the realm. Kings talk

334
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:52,323
Check

335
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:56,115
Door's wide open, Dr. Fried
-Check.

336
00:24:56,765 --> 00:24:58,995
-David?
He checks

337
00:25:01,853 --> 00:25:03,750
Bet. Twelve hundred

338
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:08,128
I'm gonna call,
because you ain't got dick

339
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:11,672
Can I steal this fucking hand?
I think I can.

340
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:12,969
I'II raise 12

341
00:25:13,368 --> 00:25:17,928

-Flush.
You motherfucker

347
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:40,825
You slow-rolled me.
What were you doing to that hand?

348
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:43,496
His money's good. He wants
to sail, it's his business.

349
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:45,208
Fuck you too

350
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:47,751

-I'm so pissed.
Good morning

354

Hunter called and said that Rachel
got an early acceptance to Wesleyan

355
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:21,117
And you didn't expect it?
-No.

356
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:25,829
-Think. Did you ever see her mom?
Please. I'm blacker than her mother

357
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:53,859
What time is it?
-It's almost 9.

358
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:57,405
How we doing?
-Slowing down.

359

Thanks

361

Want more coffee?

362
00:27:14,238 --> 00:27:17,631
Yeah, Tony, put a little sambuca
in it for me, would you?

363
00:27:19,493 --> 00:27:22,719
Anyone want to close the lights?
-Is that a game?

364
00:27:22,911 --> 00:27:24,599
He's a pisser, this kid

365
00:27:24,746 --> 00:27:25,767
Closing the lights

366
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:28,934
It means do you want to admit
you lost and pack it in?

367
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:35,569
Coming out

368
00:27:41,514 --> 00:27:45,534
How much is he into us for?
-About 45 boxes of ziti.

369
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:48,247
He grabbed ten while you slept

370
00:27:48,394 --> 00:27:49,582

372
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:53,879
Go get that

373
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,943
How do you expect to make a dime
with this fucking stonewaller?

374
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:27,495
How'd you get in here?

375
00:28:29,645 --> 00:28:31,832
Same as you. Through the front door

376
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:34,585
-Hi, Rich.
Hi, Rich?

377
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:37,503
( Tony )
I got some nice fresh lox

378
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:43,344
I should stab you in the fucking eye

379
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:47,560
Come on, Rich
-Get off me...

380
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:50,725
.or I'II put one in your head
Don't threaten me, Richie.

381
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:54,353
Don't threaten you?
I got a hard-on for you already

382
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:56,108
Give me a reason

383
00:28:59,343 --> 00:29:03,195
Don't make me embarrass you
Cutside now, I want to talk.

384
00:29:06,475 --> 00:29:09,742
Christopher, get everybody a drink
I'II be right back.

385
00:29:11,895 --> 00:29:14,875
Come on, Frank, doc, sit down

386
00:29:17,111 --> 00:29:20,463
No, Tony, I'm wiped.
I'II settle up with you next game

387
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:23,633
Give my regards to your uncle
-Have some breakfast.

388
00:29:24,118 --> 00:29:28,136
No, really, I got tickets
for the Rueles-Harris fight tonight

389
00:29:29,706 --> 00:29:32,100
IVIatt, thanks a lot.
Here's one for your pal

390
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,436
Cash me out, Sunshine

Thank you, IVIr. Sinatra, Jr., sir

392

I shut him the fuck down, he comes
here and he sticks it up my ass!

393
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:43,777
What's that got to do with you
disrespecting my game?

394
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:47,323
Like you wouIdn't be different
-You're fucking right.

395
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:51,743
I'm sick of this holier-than-thou act
and I'm not the only one.

396
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:55,581
Ch, really? Well, if anybody
wants to make a move ....

397
00:29:55,732 --> 00:29:58,000
Come on, Tony.
Don't get so fucking dramatic

398
00:29:58,193 --> 00:30:00,710
All I'm saying is you act
like you're in a different business

399
00:30:00,903 --> 00:30:03,507
Send that prick out
so I can talk to him.

400
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:11,960
Do you realize this motherless fuck
is into me for over eight large?

401
00:30:11,246 --> 00:30:13,434
He's got money to play here?

402
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,770
Let him pay me my money
Send him out.

403
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,272
Go home. This ain't gonna
happen to one of my players

404
00:30:37,688 --> 00:30:39,251
Everything all right?

405
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:45,925
Wow, he was pissed

406
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,940
I'm gonna let you sleep one day

407
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:52,596
Then you're gonna get up
and get my $45,000.

408
00:30:52,745 --> 00:30:54,580
Yeah, no problem

409
00:30:54,709 --> 00:30:59,269
How about the luck on that Silvio?
-Why don't you shut the fuck up?

410
00:31:02,215 --> 00:31:06,778
I could use a schvitz.
Want to go for a schvitz?

411
00:31:09,471 --> 00:31:11,783
If you don't give me
every penny...

412
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:16,370
...I'II send somebody to you every
Saturday for five percent interest.

413
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:19,332
If you don't have it,
I'II tack it on to the principal

414
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,752
Understand?

415
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:26,880
Listen, Tony, I had a good run
there for a while.

416
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,467
I should have quit then, though

417
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:35,138
So you never told me
how your kid made out at Bowdoin

418
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:38,895
How my what?

419
00:31:46,174 --> 00:31:48,278
Would you like anything else?

420
00:31:54,142 --> 00:31:57,454
Tony, did I do something
to insult you?

421
00:31:58,435 --> 00:31:59,833
Two days

422
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:29,775
-How'd we do?
Not done counting, but it's up there

423
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:32,655
At least 80 boxes of ziti
after expenses.

Two boxes came out of my pocket

Salut

You fucking believe it?
We now run the executive game

428
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:53,508
Sil, remember when we used to
look through that crack in the door

429
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:56,540
when my old man and Junior had it?

430
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:58,150
Yeah, I remember

431
00:32:58,163 --> 00:33:00,434
Junior would chase us down the street

How you doing, Eric?
-Good.

Sounds good
-Thanks.

Are you awake now?
-Yeah.

-The store.

-When?
I don't know

445

He's here every Christmas Eve
You don't ask?

446

have to pummel his ass

Was he seriously
developmentally disabled?

469
00:35:52,464 --> 00:35:55,190
Serious? No, he had everybody
in stitches back then.

470
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:04,198

you have a retarded family member

about coming here?

Is it permissible now?

Is it enough of a sad tragedy that you
can join the rest of the douche bags?

to him a couple days ago

Come on, get up. We're leaving
-Thank you, God.

480
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,805
-I will kill you.
We paid our respects. We're leaving

481

This may be a shock, but they're not
here to see Sopranos kill each other.

-Hi, Carm.
Hi, Richie

483
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:23,614
Come on. I gotta give mine too

484
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:52,808
How many rooms this place got?
-It's a big joint.

485
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,938
This is a pretty good racket

486
00:37:59,506 --> 00:38:02,194
I don't think you can smoke in here

487
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:05,947
Who's gonna complain? Him?

00:38:06,178 --> 00:38:07,950
Hey, you mind?

00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:11,787
He don't mind

Listen, Anthony

491
00:38:17,984 --> 00:38:20,544
I'm sorry about blowing up
in your game.

492
00:38:24,321 --> 00:38:25,968
You were out of line

493
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:32,970
Back off and respect the title
you jerkoff.

494
00:38:32,664 --> 00:38:35,102
It's your ball. You make the rules

495
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:40,147
No, no, I don't make them.
They've always been there

496
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,400
And David Scatino doesn't pay you
a penny until I get mine first.

497
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:47,779
That's the tax you get for raising
your hands at my game.

498
00:38:47,972 --> 00:38:51,407
I get mine, then you get yours
That's how it's gonna be.

499
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:54,996
I don't do something,
how's it gonna look?

500
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,836
If everyone could
please take their seats

501

the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen

Since it has pleased Almighty God
to call our brother from this life...

...we commit his body to the earth to
return to that from which it was made

Christ was the first
to rise from the dead

You shouIdn't take shit from him

I heard you the first time
Let's drop the subject.

/-\|| right

509
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,715
Tony put me back in action
Gave me 50 G's.

510
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:50,217
What is that, nothing?
-Please.

511
00:39:50,452 --> 00:39:54,803
I know how things work. Don't forget
I was Daddy's little girl.

512
00:40:00,751 --> 00:40:02,522
He didn't do you any favor

513
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:05,525
When my father was in his position

514
00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:09,653
he gave Romeo IVIartin $50,000
when he got out ofjail.

515
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:12,656
Now we're talking about 30 years ago

516
00:40:12,846 --> 00:40:14,869
Thirty years ago

517
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:20,875
Fifty thousand

518
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,520
What's this fucking appointment
you had when my friend came?

519
00:40:44,671 --> 00:40:46,650
Think I'm still a kid
on the school bus?

520
00:40:46,798 --> 00:40:49,277
Please, Tony, I'm doing my best here

521
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:53,446
I fucked up, okay? I'm gonna make
it all work out somehow, I swear.

522
00:40:53,597 --> 00:40:56,740
What do you got for me?
-I'm tapped.

523
00:40:56,849 --> 00:40:59,800
Stand up
-Why?

524
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:01,810
Because Ijust said so. Get up

525
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,792
Get up or I'II rip
your fucking head off

526
00:41:04,981 --> 00:41:06,170
Come on

527
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:12,631
I'm sorry, Tony.
I wouIdn't do anything to insult you

528
00:41:12,824 --> 00:41:14,845
Cur kids go to school together

529
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:21,683
Tony, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm just having some bad luck

530
00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:23,104
It just got worse

531
00:41:25,546 --> 00:41:30,250
I'm gonna come back.
IVIy Iuck's gonna change

532
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:33,861
Tomorrow. I want something tomorrow
You understand me?

533
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:37,535
(CRYING )

534
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:55,969
Where's the wife?
-She's home.

535
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:59,514
Can I talk to you?
-You all right?

536
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:03,600
Sit down. Sit down

537
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:12,653
Talk to me

538
00:42:12,883 --> 00:42:15,155
I got myself in a little bind

539
00:42:17,596 --> 00:42:19,368
Jesus, I feel ashamed

540
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:22,360
Well, what's going on? What happened?

541
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:25,583
I'm in ajam, a bad one

542
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:28,500
This could cost me
my marriage, my business

543
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:31,753
I'm sure there's something
we can do. What kind ofjam?

544
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,512
God, no, Artie

545
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,764
Talk to me. I'm your friend

546
00:42:42,412 --> 00:42:44,143
I need money

547
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:48,630
IVIoney, Artie. Not much, just

548
00:42:52,926 --> 00:42:55,860
How much money are we talking?
-Just enough...

549
00:42:56,596 --> 00:43:00,198
...to give me some breathing
room until I get the rest together

550
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:02,286
It's 20 thousand

551
00:43:07,187 --> 00:43:08,543
Davey

552
00:43:11,191 --> 00:43:14,381
Shit. Bad timing. IVIan!

553
00:43:14,531 --> 00:43:19,800
You won't believe it, but
I gotta put a new roof on this place

554
00:43:22,998 --> 00:43:26,558
God forgive me for saying this,
but did you consider Chapter 11?

555
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:28,812
Tony Soprano's not gonna buy that

556
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,231
Tony

557
00:43:32,755 --> 00:43:36,319
Ch, jeez, Davey. Jesus Christ

558
00:44:16,258 --> 00:44:18,819
Eric, give me the keys
-Why?

559
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:21,446
-There's mud all over the tires.
( Female ) Dave, what's wrong?

560
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:24,740
Say goodbye to your truck
-( Eric ) What?

561
00:44:24,224 --> 00:44:26,786
-Dave.
Ch, this is bullshit!

562
00:44:26,978 --> 00:44:30,747
I warned you, no off-roading.
I gave you enough chances!

563
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,542
Dave, this is not the place
-Dad, I didn't do anything!

564
00:44:33,735 --> 00:44:36,377
Eric, accountability is everything
-Cff-roading?

565
00:44:36,529 --> 00:44:39,714
I drove it onto the field to bring
some girls to cheerleading!

566
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:42,968
There's mud all over the doors
I warned you!

567
00:44:43,118 --> 00:44:46,554
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything, IVIom!

568
00:44:46,788 --> 00:44:49,580
-Get in the house.
I fucking hate you

569
00:44:49,248 --> 00:44:51,687
You apologize, right now!

570
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:55,316
Cpen them

571
00:45:05,889 --> 00:45:07,412
You like it?

572
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:11,373
This is Eric's jeep

573
00:45:11,605 --> 00:45:14,916
Ch, my God.
Is this Eric Scatino's jeep?

574
00:45:17,446 --> 00:45:22,500
-His dad sold it to you?
Yeah, you know. Something like that

575
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:24,718
What do you mean,
Something like that"?

576
00:45:25,658 --> 00:45:27,140
You know

577
00:45:34,459 --> 00:45:35,564
Jesus, Tony

578
00:45:38,299 --> 00:45:41,401
I'II eat it before I give it back
What am I, a sucker?

579
00:45:41,553 --> 00:45:45,196
What does Eric have to do with
his father? What'd he do to you?

580
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:48,449
The guy owed me money, and he did
the right thing offering the car.

581
00:45:48,598 --> 00:45:49,704
Yeah, right

582
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,205
This is you talking

583
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,706
His wife's close to the brother-in-law
of the provost at Georgetown.

584
00:45:57,566 --> 00:45:59,870
You want to act holier-than-thou?

585
00:45:59,235 --> 00:46:00,838
Go ahead, but I'm not giving it back

586
00:46:02,907 --> 00:46:06,341
Then I'm gonna buy clothes and food
and shoes and CDs...

587
00:46:06,536 --> 00:46:10,388
...and all the rest of the shit I've
been buying since you were born!

588
00:46:10,624 --> 00:46:14,641
Everything comes from the work I do!
-All right, Tony, that's enough.

589
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:18,647
A grown man made a wager. He lost

590
00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:21,649
He made another one. He lost again
End of story.

591
00:46:21,843 --> 00:46:26,690
Take that high moral ground and go
sleep in the bus station if you want!

592
00:47:12,682 --> 00:47:13,788
Where?

593
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,870
Tony

594
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,964
I almost didn't make it
Where's Janice?

595
00:47:25,364 --> 00:47:28,799
Didn't I see those at the wake?
-That's funny.

596
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:33,514
I'II see you after the show

597
00:47:58,229 --> 00:48:00,709
Just keep thinking of IVIeadow

598
00:48:03,694 --> 00:48:06,797
Eric, come on! Let's talk.
You're just gonna leave?

599
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:08,549
I thought you were my friend

600
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,176
I am. I can't stop my dad
from selling it.

601
00:48:11,327 --> 00:48:14,387
Your dad's a fucking asshole
you know that?

602
00:48:14,536 --> 00:48:16,224
He's a real low-life asshole

603
00:48:16,372 --> 00:48:18,351
I suppose yours is innocent?

604
00:48:18,543 --> 00:48:22,187
For your information, he gave it
to my dad. He didn't steal it.

605
00:48:22,798 --> 00:48:26,774
You know what, IVIeadow?
Fuck you, fuck your gangster father

606
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:29,280
and fuck this!

If you think you may need a lozenge

613
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:57,263
...may we suggest that now
would be the time to unwrap it

614
00:48:57,622 --> 00:49:00,350

the performance.
