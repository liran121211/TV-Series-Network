00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:42,427
We 'll get Barbara, Tom and the kids
and make a reunion out of it.

177
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:46,556
-But obviously ....
Your mother isn't welcome

178
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:48,143
Give Janice my love

179
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:50,729
See you later

180
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:58,276
l\/ly sister's here from Seattle
-Nice.

181
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:09,286
Let me pinch those bulldog cheeks
Come over here!

182
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:15,751
That water down there. You think
you'd have shit some weight off.

183
00:20:16,404 --> 00:20:19,297
You say we were gonna crab the
river looking for him?

184
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,383
What's the matter with you?
-Tony explained it.

185
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:26,637
-Listen to this.
You heard about Jimmy Altieri?

186
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,475
Flipped, fucking asshole

187
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:36,607
...all those payments,
I guess just evaporated?

188
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:43,991
No shit

189
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:49,284
-They all paid up to the letter?
Few things got lost in the confusion

190
00:20:49,768 --> 00:20:50,998
You can picture

191
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:53,790
Did what we could with the
information we had.

192
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:56,627
Boss of the family
deserves the credit

193
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,965
( Speaking Italian )

194
00:21:01,362 --> 00:21:04,100
Salute!
Salute!

195
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:07,389
Hey, Silv
-What?

196
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:08,683
What ?

197
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:11,975
I've been gone a long time
Let me hear it.

198
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:21,195
All right, Kay

199
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:25,739
Just this one time, I'II let you
ask me about my affairs."

200
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:30,913
Is it true, lVIichaeI?

201
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:38,253
You fucking schifosa

202
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:44,176
Cur true enemy has yet

203
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:45,927
to reveal himself

204
00:21:47,326 --> 00:21:48,597
(WHY)
He's on a roll!

205
00:21:49,787 --> 00:21:52,308
I gotta get the fuck out of here!

206
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,813
Ch, Tony, I hate to ruin the party

207
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,107
Got a call from Loiaco
down at brokerage.

208
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,485
Chip and DaIe" sent one
of the brokers...

209
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:07,300
...to the emergency room.
Ch, fuck me! These kids!

210
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,452
lVIy fucking nephew, right?

211
00:22:11,602 --> 00:22:15,497
You call him and tell him
I want to see him right away

212
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:28,178
It all checks out

213
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:32,764
Puerto Rico, the clinic.
All that shit, from what I can tell

214
00:22:45,511 --> 00:22:49,290
How was the guest bed, sleep okay?
-Great.

215
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:52,158
Except usually I bring my own
pillow. Ergonomic.

216
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:55,537
Got ripped off at a bus stop
in Rapid City.

217
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:57,873
LinoIeum's not good enough no more?

218
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:03,378
How you doing, Jan?
-Good.

219
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:06,256
-"Parvati."
I'm her brother, I get a pass

220
00:23:06,698 --> 00:23:09,592
You look good.
You look like a teenager

221
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:13,846
l\/ly therapist says I'm regressing
-Your therapist?

222
00:23:13,997 --> 00:23:16,267
-Who pays for that?
State of Washington

223
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:18,519
Total disability
-Ch, yeah...

224
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:20,521
the Epstein-Barr
-Was.

225
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:23,647
Carpal tunnel from my last job
Steam milk machine.

226
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:25,527
No worse pain

227
00:23:30,762 --> 00:23:32,617
Late, you know, morning

228
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:36,413
What's that smell?

229
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:38,623
lVIiso soup with seaweed

230
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:40,792
She was telling us about Seattle

231
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,377
I better not see those
grunge pants on you.

232
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:46,629
Dad, how do you stay so hip?
-I'II be back in a sec.

233
00:23:46,781 --> 00:23:49,924
Don't let your father near my soup
He makes fun...

234
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,809
Don't see her in years
and you start in on her diet?

235
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,686
Believe me, she gives as good
as she gets.

236
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
Give me a hit off that

237
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:15,367
Ch, ho! Who's in charge here?

238
00:24:23,276 --> 00:24:28,870
Beautiful kids. You must be proud
-Yeah, how about that, huh?

239
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:31,900
Even with our genes

240
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:36,680
So, you still with that...AdoIf?

241
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:38,393
Ro

242
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,644
No. Rolf went back to Andorra

243
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:49,191
-You seem good. lVIood-wise.
Yeah, things are very good nowadays

244
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,696
How are things really with lVIa?

245
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:55,617
She's dead to me

246
00:24:57,641 --> 00:24:59,412
I don't want to get in your way

247
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:01,705
You stayed and took the brunt

248
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:04,375
Barb and I, we're never gonna forget

249
00:25:06,193 --> 00:25:10,504
You forgot it okay for about 20
years. At least Barb pitched in

250
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:15,634
I've made my share of mistakes. But
l\/Ia can't stay in the hospital forever.

251
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:20,473
I'II tell you about her stroke.
It's called a conversion reaction

252
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:24,394
It's a big opera brought on by
repressed rage. It's bullshit.

253
00:25:24,584 --> 00:25:26,272
No infarc-whatever-the-fuck

254
00:25:26,463 --> 00:25:29,189
But the symptoms were the same
as a stroke...

255
00:25:29,381 --> 00:25:32,690
so she can't take care of herself

256
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,653
She's on the Iam in that hospital
From me.

257
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:42,202
lVIom is bewildered. I mention you
and her eyes fill up with tears.

258
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:44,541
Ch, boy!

259
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:48,419
I'm not asking you to step in, Tony

260
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:51,421
It's my turn now. That's why I came

261
00:25:51,945 --> 00:25:54,800
She's a strega. She's the devil

262
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:59,177
She was. Now she's just a confused
frightened old woman.

263
00:26:05,252 --> 00:26:08,603
to fix her car so I can get back
and forth to the hospital.

264
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:14,738
Gh, I doubt that

265
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:17,822
I just put her house on the market
-Ch.

266
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:21,120
Look

267
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm glad you're here. Ckay?

268
00:26:28,318 --> 00:26:31,710
You want to play Florence Nightingale
that's your choice.

269
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:37,717
Cnly this is the last time
we mention her in this house

270
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:40,970
Ckay

271
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:56,238
Hey, Ti

272
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:04,952
Seven and Seven, over here.
Whoa, what's the matter now?

273
00:27:05,312 --> 00:27:08,956
Loiaco called. Your two friends
beat the shit out of a broker.

274
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,917
-Two others quit.
He was pushing some other stock!

275
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:14,714
It attracts negative attention

276
00:27:14,905 --> 00:27:18,256
Then the fucks rip off
a Porsche from our own building

277
00:27:18,492 --> 00:27:21,844
-I'II call them.
No, you'II go down there. Now

278
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:31,520
I told you, spend more time
down at the brokerage.

279
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:35,649
You're the SEC compliance officer
for chrissake!

280
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,988
You gotta exercise impulse control

281
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:43,159
Ckay, Ton. I'm sorry

282
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,161
Ckay

283
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:46,497
/-\|| right

284
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:55,878
I can't show it in this condition
-What is this?

285
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,177
You don't even want to see
the toilets.

286
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,846
(PHoNE RINGING)

287
00:28:02,888 --> 00:28:03,638
Excuse me

288
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,562
Wait'II I catch these kids

289
00:28:10,794 --> 00:28:12,853
Break a few windows,
think they're Johnny Badass

290
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:14,220
The fuckin' jackals

291
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:18,734
Your sister Barbara and the kids
are coming down.

292
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:20,905
You better not be in this mood

293
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:25,573
-And I need you to pick up sausage.
Yeah, how many pounds, hot or sweet?

294
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:29,495
Don't you act like it's a chore
This party was your idea.

295
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,582
You said you were happy
Janice was home.

296
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:35,544
And my parents are coming and

297
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:37,798
Ch, really?

298
00:28:41,992 --> 00:28:45,302
She said some horrible things
to them over the years.

299
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:51,309
Hey, I'm not defending her
She's dead to me.

300
00:28:51,585 --> 00:28:54,520
lVIope your way through this
I'II cut your throat.

301
00:28:54,713 --> 00:28:58,190
I've been in a great mood lately
-Right.

302
00:28:58,425 --> 00:29:01,860
You need to start therapy again
You're self-medicating.

303
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:05,531
We haven't had sex since
-Forget it. No therapy.

304
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,910
You should take a look at what they
did to your mother's bedroom.

305
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:19,753
They're rookies. They're not used
to this kind of stress ....

306
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:22,715
He better not say a word
-It won't happen again.

307
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:26,801
-You got my word on that.
I appreciate it, Chris, thank you

308
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:30,141
Come on in

309
00:29:31,582 --> 00:29:34,103
Hey, Chris, brought you a little capp

310
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,190
Thanks

311
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,858
Sit down

312
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:48,657
Refresh my memory on this play
we're making on Webistics.

313
00:29:52,477 --> 00:29:54,456
Trade on the bulletin board, CTC

314
00:29:54,647 --> 00:29:57,458
If we cold-call enough
seniors, pump and dump

315
00:29:57,651 --> 00:30:01,628
Yeah, yeah. You guys ain't spent
much time in the NFL, face it.

316
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,757
What? Two years with Eddie Stags

317
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:05,635
Besides waxing his car

318
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:08,677
-When he was in county--
When you're bleeding a guy

319
00:30:08,828 --> 00:30:11,264
you don't squeeze him
dry right away.

320
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,600
Contrarily, you let him
do his bidding. Suavely

321
00:30:16,295 --> 00:30:20,397
So you can bleed next week and the
week after. At a minimum.

322
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:28,780
We don't need a guy getting pissed
and running to the SEC.

323
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:38,875
You'II know when you need to know

324
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:40,629
Excellent

325
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:43,965
This is cold, by the way

326
00:30:47,322 --> 00:30:48,762
Guys

327
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:54,560
Any more Porsches disappear, make it
two towns over. And I want a taste.

328
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:55,644
You're the man

329
00:31:04,383 --> 00:31:06,445
She's gonna be so happy to see you

330
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:24,630
Grandma, you've got to eat

331
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,910
Let me die

332
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,176
Don't say that

333
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:30,110
I saw alight

334
00:31:31,117 --> 00:31:33,138
And voices calling out to me

335
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,807
What went on with you and Dad?
lVIom won't tell me.

336
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:44,942
He blames me for everything

337
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:46,277
I know. l\/Ie too

338
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,948
At night...they hit us

339
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:54,310
Why can't our family just get along?
-Some people don't want to.

340
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:58,370
But you, you listen to him
You do what he says.

341
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:00,166
He's your father

342
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:06,961
I won't leave you here like this.
They can't stop me from seeing you

343
00:32:08,154 --> 00:32:10,927
lVIeadow. lVIeadow

344
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,347
Take that, in the drawer, in the
drawer. Take it.

345
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:26,481
Ch, my God. This was
your grandmother's, wasn't it?
