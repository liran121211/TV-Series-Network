-It's how you get better.

Cne thing I could tell you.
It would kill him to see me now

Here's your ice cream.
Then we can take our walk

91
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:11,155
Leave me alone, please

92
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:14,990

push me out.

-I can't take this anymore.
lVIrs. Soprano, what's wrong?

94

She just started crying

You don't know
what goes through my mind

98
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:37,720
-Well, that's for fucking sure!
Someday, I hope you have children

99
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:41,351
and they treat you like this

100
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,814
I gave my life to my children
-This is bullshit.

101
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:54,991
Talk to me

102
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:59,409
These activists, they're killing me
They're picketing my place 24-7.

103
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,205
Three days I'm down

104
00:09:01,397 --> 00:09:04,246

'Not enough minorities
doing the joint-fitting."

106
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:11,212
That's under my uncIe's jurisdiction
-I know.

107
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:14,841
But you could talk to him,
maybe send some guys down

108
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:21,223
Like you did, with your unions
-It's gonna cost you.

109
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:24,518
You're already raping me
with those no-showjobs.

110
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:28,688
You're not such a citizen
when you want a bid to go your way

111
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,360
Take it easy

112
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:35,362
I'II see what I can do.
In the meantime, call animal control

113
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:37,948
Watch you don't get followed
meeting me.

114
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:54,900
You're late

Bobby Baccalieri,
the last man standing

116
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:02,889
-I'm not saying nothing.
Don't want to get in trouble

117
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,851
A lot of funerals in your corner
of the world, huh?

118
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:12,776
Look at me, not the floor

119
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:23,243
Tell him I'm gonna let him keep on
earning. Subsistence level.

120
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:26,623
He'II be able to pay his lawyers

121
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:29,752
Let me say for him, thank you

122
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:35,713
You're gonna hear some high-end shit
And A: I hope you understand it...

123
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:40,100
...and B: I hope you keep it
between this room and Junior

124
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:45,140
If you don't, they're gonna find
pieces of you in different dumpsters

125
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:47,311
I inherited Junior

126
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:51,980
You got no reason to talk to me
this way. I always liked you.

127
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:54,983
Bullshit.
But we'II assume you do now

128
00:10:56,803 --> 00:11:00,363
Tell my uncle he gets to keep 5%
5% of his shy...

...the sports betting.
Same with the coke

130
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:06,912
The Joint-Fitters Union
it's all his, okay?

131
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:09,958
Listen. This is very important

132
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:13,128
He also gets to keep his stripes

133
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,547
As far as the feds are concerned
they've got the boss in jail.

134
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:19,968
Hearing different creates confusion

135
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:21,722
Got it

136
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:25,550
As far as the rest of everything
that Junior owned...

137
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:26,893
it's now mine

138
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:32,355
I'II get this to him, Tony

139
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,234
That's it

140
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:44,534
To the victor belongs the spoils

141
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:48,786
Get out of here before I shove
your quotations book up your fat ass!

142
00:11:55,111 --> 00:11:59,470
l\/Ir. Bompensiero, is your wife
here to drive you home?

143
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:01,553
Skip

144
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,435
Skip?

145
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:18,360
How we feeling?
-Fucking great.

146
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:22,290
He's gonna be out of it
for an hour or so.

147
00:12:22,222 --> 00:12:26,490
It went great. You'II feel the
difference in your back in a few days

148
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:28,869
Buzz me when he feels ready to leave

149
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:40,506
l\/ly back don't feel one iota different

150
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:44,930
It'II take a couple of days
for the steroids to kick in.

151
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:46,221
I gotta get in my Jacuzzi

152
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:48,849
Too much stress in your life, Sal

153
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,892
Tony doesn't know you're back yet?
-Jesus Christ, no.

154
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:02,818
Take advantage of the government's
generosity, playing both ends.

155
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:08,117
He's already suspicious
I gotta be careful.

156
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:10,162
Altieri ate the pill for you

157
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:13,705
Any suspicions went to the grave
with Jimmy Altieri.

158
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:18,125
I've known Tony 30 years, now this?
-Spare me, okay?

159
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,172
You been on our tit since '98

160
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:23,798
Chauffeur to and from the doctor
that we found for you.

161
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,303
We let you back on the street
We want results.

162
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:30,223
He tried to suffocate his own mother

163
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,144
His own uncle wanted him whacked

164
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:37,270
You said he's been shitting on you
for years.

165
00:13:37,464 --> 00:13:40,773
-I know what I said.
Plus he's been crying to a shrink

166
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:42,402
You don't owe him dick

167
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:46,446
Don't take a bullet for a yuppie
who thinks you're his errand boy

168
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:53,953
Your Honor, this man should not be
released for medical reasons.

169
00:13:54,146 --> 00:13:57,207
Every time we get an elder
lVIafioso incarcerated. _ _

170
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,210
we get the same bag of tricks
-Your Honor.

171
00:14:00,696 --> 00:14:05,890
I take offense at the characterization
of my client as a lVIafioso.

172
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:08,217
l\/Ir. Soprano has not been found
guilty of anything.

173
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:11,179
He's awaiting trial for allegations
-Noted.

174
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:14,640
With all due respect to the state's
medical facilities...

175
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:18,895
...in his condition,
l\/Ir. Soprano has every right

176
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:26,611
l\/Ir. Soprano has a benign illness.
A few clogged arteries, Your Honor

177
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:29,906
I'm leaning towards releasing
this man from Iockup.

178
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:36,749
l\/Ir. Soprano

179
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:40,585
If I approve this, you will
be under house arrest.

180
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:42,504
You understand this concept?

181
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:44,340
Not really

182
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:49,550
It means that you must remain
in your residence. You cannot leave

183
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:53,721
Except for doctor's appointments
food shopping.

184
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:57,725
Your Honor, the government asks
for an electronic bracelet.

185
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:01,979
Your Honor, while we certainly agree
to house arrest...

186
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:04,860
we are asking that l\/Ir. Soprano

187
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:13,340
He shows no prior arrest since 1968

188
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:17,745
He pays his taxes and he's a veteran
of the Second World War.

189
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,583
l\/Ir. Soprano, do you have any problem
with wearing an electronic bracelet?

190
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:25,171
It sounds like Nazi Germany to me

191
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:29,967
Cbviously you need
a history lesson, sir.

192
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:32,387
I don't think that we, you and I

193
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:35,555
should let our shared sorrow
or biases...

194
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:37,309
enter into this, judge

195
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:39,686
He's wearing a bracelet

196
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,111
(BuzzER)

197
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:02,456
-Who are you?
Jesus, you scared the shit out of me

198
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:05,336
Jesus ain't got nothing
to do with it.

199
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:07,590
What do you want?

200
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:10,382
I'm looking for your son
Is he around?

201
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:13,530
You a friend?
Is he around?

202
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:15,556
He'II be back here soon

203
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:19,935
Well, come on in

204
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:33,696
You were a good-looking guy
backthen.

205
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:39,327
Still am. Still got the same teeth
as in that picture.

206
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:40,998
Ch, yeah?

207
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:46,876
Go ahead and laugh. That picture
was taken 57 years ago.

208
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,464
-Cld.
Come on. How old are you?

209
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:54,759
-75.
Add eight more and you got it

210
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:57,679
83.
Get the fuck out of here!

211
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,580
What do you want with my son?
-Gotta discuss a little business.

212
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:04,146
If you say so

213
00:17:04,795 --> 00:17:07,565
So you're 28 years old
when World War II starts

214
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:09,985
That's a little long in the tooth

215
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:15,300
In '43 they was taking everyone
no matter how old or ugly.

216
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:20,952
They even took a fat boy I knew
He was already 34.

217
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:24,164
Wasn't no good to nobody
except he could cook.

218
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:27,501
I swear he was more dangerous
with that...

219
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,796
stove than he was with that rifle

220
00:17:29,986 --> 00:17:32,173
You ever watch the History Channel?

221
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:35,500
-Television?
No, the History Channel

222
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:39,520
I think you'd like it.
They even do a lot of that Bible shit

223
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,515
Gnly shit in the Bible came out
of Pharaoh's ass...

224
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:44,811
when lVIoses parted the Red Sea

225
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:49,148
Parted the Red Sea, praise his name

226
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,652
Never underestimate a man's
determination to be free.

227
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:04,873
I'II come back at another time

228
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:21,723
Break it, you pay for it

229
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:37,573
He gave me the message

230
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,409
Well, don't fucking pout.
Be grateful I'm letting you earn

231
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:47,124
What's on your mind?

232
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:50,711
How'd you swing this?

233
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:56,130
-Dr. Schreck, he's lVIonty's kid.
The bookie's son is a cardiologist?

234
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:01,510
-It's not bad.
Feds can't bug your doctor's office

235
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:04,224
Lets me use this place sometimes

236
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:06,977
To conduct business

237
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,687
You hear about lVIassarone Construction?

238
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:14,357
Bacala is taking care of it.
They know he speaks for me

239
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:19,700
It's gotta go 80-40, my way
-Did you do what I asked?

240
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:22,782
What did you ask me to do?
-You know, make peace.

241
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:27,412
Listen, that's enough with that shit
That woman is dead to me.

242
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:28,541
You let it go!

243
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:32,792
Why? She's my brother's wife.
She doesn't realize half the time

244
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:39,215
I heard the tapes the feds made
at Green Grove.

245
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:42,886
So she's crazy half the time.
Which half did you listen to?

246
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:51,894
Nobody played me. She didn't know
she was setting you up to get popped

247
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:56,316
That's right! Your uncle
isn't as dumb as you think!

248
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:58,903
You and that miserable fuck, Altieri

249
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:04,742
Now you let sleeping dogs lie, okay?

250
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:07,538
I have my reasons

251
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:11,872
I'II tell you one dog you left
barking, that fucking Freddie Capuano

252
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,506
The guy who owns Green Grove?

253
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:21,133
He's like an old lady, going around

254
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:24,344
.telling Soprano business
to anybody who'II listen!

255
00:20:24,495 --> 00:20:27,514
He's the one saying you tried
to whack your mother.

256
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:32,644
Even implied that me and her..
That hairpiece motherfucker!

257
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:46,615
Did everybody take a vow of silence?
Got anything to report?

258
00:20:50,227 --> 00:20:51,707
Isn't that interesting?

259
00:20:51,854 --> 00:20:54,793
I just saw, on Inside Edition

260
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:59,300
...how there will be no more
unknown soldiers because of DNA

261
00:20:59,197 --> 00:21:04,383
-They can identify all casualties.
Pass me some more of that macaroni

262
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:09,597
Tony, I know you don't like
to talk about her but...

263
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:12,519
that woman is impossible

264
00:21:13,585 --> 00:21:17,105
She's a complete narcissist
I mean, "me, me, me."

265
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,819
Really, kudos. You are a saint

266
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:26,491
You talking about Grandma?

267
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:32,328
She pushes those buttons.
She's a big baby, you know?

268
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:42,133
Tony

269
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:46,800
This is my house.
How many times I gotta say it?

270
00:21:47,158 --> 00:21:48,680
Thank you, II Duce

271
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:58,732
It's my fault, lVIed

272
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:01,943
I was insensitive to his feelings

273
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:05,531
Thank you

274
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:09,950
You see that?
See how easy that was?

275
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:21,796
As long as it gets sold

276
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:24,257
I don't give a fuck who lists it

277
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:33,560
You see what happens with you
cursing at the dinner table?

278
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:17,934
Thanks. It's hard to find people
over 25 to drive with.

279
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:21,478
Don't tell them you drove me
to buy pot. Which should be legal

280
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:25,899
Gnly thing that works for my hands
lVIed, wasn't that a stop sign?

281
00:23:29,513 --> 00:23:33,740
He's insecure. He's afraid
to leave New Jersey...

282
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:36,786
and threatened by freedom
-It's too pathetic.

283
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:39,248
How about Grandma in that center?

284
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:42,917
I'm dying to go see her, but
I've had so much homework.

285
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:47,296

to do to get into a good college.

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,552
You know Grandma pretty well?

288
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:54,889
What is she into?

289
00:23:55,831 --> 00:23:59,726
I don't know. Negativity?
-But seriously.

290
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,728
There must be something.
Isn't there anything she likes doing?

291
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:07,525
l\/ly dad used to find her these
old records, these sisters.

292

been too easy.

Well, how'd I look? Be honest

You looked, you know, like you
You looked good.

303
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:00,380

305
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:08,379
What's wrong with them?

306
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:14,716
How much did those frames cost?
-Insurance pays.

307
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:18,222
I never see the bill
-Nice country.

but guess how many nucleotides
per strand?

344
00:29:45,594 --> 00:29:46,658
Just tell her

345
00:29:47,223 --> 00:29:50,285
-A hundred million.
Wow, that's amazing

346
00:29:51,434 --> 00:29:52,789
She knows when we eat

347
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:55,956
Don't be setting a plate for her
if she's not here.

348
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:05,841
Bless us our Lord,
and the gifts we are about to

349

Hello! Gh

350
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:12,641
Good. You guys started without me

351
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:16,729
And bless us our Lord, amen

352
00:30:18,714 --> 00:30:22,441
Janice, if you're gonna be late
call. Cr you're not gonna eat.

353
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,279
Don't send me to bed hungry, Daddy

354
00:30:31,101 --> 00:30:34,162
She learned from the best!
-Hey, go, girl!

355
00:30:34,313 --> 00:30:37,331
-Congratulations.
I was nervous, parallel-parking

356
00:30:37,523 --> 00:30:39,627

363
00:31:16,937 --> 00:31:18,875

in Seattle?

we had some really great news
about l\/Ia today.

367
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,865
Her therapist says
she's making great strides

368
00:31:56,562 --> 00:32:00,580
_.when nothing's wrong with her?
It's called Face-Saving Therapy.

369
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:08,923
lVIedicare's not gonna pay for it
if it's not real, would they?

370
00:32:09,781 --> 00:32:12,261
And the taxpayer foots the bill

371
00:32:12,703 --> 00:32:17,680
It's not much longer now.
But she's gonna need a place to stay

372
00:32:20,794 --> 00:32:24,187
-Tony, it is her house.
Dead people don't have houses

373
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:25,941
Daddy bought that house

374
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,410
take her back to Green Grove

375
00:32:36,975 --> 00:32:38,704
What? The nursing home?

376
00:32:39,396 --> 00:32:42,748
-"Retirement community."
I don't have that kind of money!

Uh-huh

No, I don't think so.
I'II go back to the other place

417
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:08,685
The nursing home? No, that's for
people who don't have anybody.

418
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:12,982
It's not that bad. And they give
you fresh towels every day.

419
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:15,403
Barbara said you hated it

420
00:35:15,552 --> 00:35:19,445
-But it's too much trouble.
No, Ma, you can't go back there

421
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:22,660
why not?
-Because.

422
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:27,390
Because it's dangerous there

423

Take a deep breath.

Stop it.

This may be a good time to talk
about this.

There's no emergency provision
on file.

437

-DNR?
Do Not Resuscitate

439
00:36:35,423 --> 00:36:39,192
It's to save the family anguish
and decisions at a difficult time.

I'm sorry, Tony, but the hospital
needs a decision on this.

-Auxiliary B, what the fuck?
If you have power of attorney

445
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:58,505

live on tubes and machines...

449
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:08,681
because you won't sign a DNR?

450
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:12,183
What? When she's a vegetable
she's not gonna care!

451

To deprive your mother
of a place to live.

452
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:19,483

to make peace with my mother

You know what? Take her
You can have her.

each other. It's worth watching.

carouse around on a school night

to visit Grandma.

461

You said we could visit.
You can drive if you want

00:41:18,288 --> 00:41:20,975
-Movie, Ma?
Ch, Mrs. Soprano

510
00:41:21,123 --> 00:41:22,562
No, take this one

511
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:25,438
She gets her ballet shoes

512
00:41:25,588 --> 00:41:29,108
she sells them and takes
the money to Newark...

513
00:41:29,298 --> 00:41:32,111
and she buys amphetamines

514
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:34,740
She was a child then

515
00:41:34,931 --> 00:41:38,365
I think you should live
with your daughter, Mrs. Soprano

516
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:42,663
I think I'm gonna leave
all my money to you, honey

517
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:45,958
What are you talking about, money?

518
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:51,600
I've gotta catch up on some charts

519
00:41:53,988 --> 00:41:55,940
Janice

520
00:41:55,241 --> 00:41:58,130
what did I tell you last week?

521
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:06,353
You know this is very important
I must have put it somewhere.

522
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:17,710
You don't fool me.
I know what you're thinking about

523
00:42:17,221 --> 00:42:19,243
My name's Janice

524
00:42:19,432 --> 00:42:22,705
Janice, Ma. You named me

525
00:42:22,853 --> 00:42:25,330
It's something else
you threw away of mine

526
00:42:30,942 --> 00:42:32,589
Are you sure

527
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:35,758
.I didn't say where
I put that money?

528
00:42:36,782 --> 00:42:38,929
Let's not worry about that

529
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:41,473
Let's just get you better

530
00:42:41,664 --> 00:42:45,599
...so you can go home
and I can take good care of you

531
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:50,191
We'|| find it

532
00:42:58,678 --> 00:43:00,576
(Hu|v||v||No)

533
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,713
Your sister's cunt!

534
00:43:23,373 --> 00:43:28,559
-That was wonderful, reverend.
You call us if you need anything

535
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,640
Thank you

536
00:43:42,472 --> 00:43:44,120
What's all this?

537
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:46,622
My father has passed away

538
00:43:46,769 --> 00:43:48,415
I wasjust talking to him

539
00:43:48,606 --> 00:43:52,124
He lived well.
God blessed him with longevity

540
00:43:53,568 --> 00:43:56,463
What are you gonna do?
We all will have our time.

541
00:43:57,323 --> 00:44:00,467
My father didn't know about
our business arrangement.

542
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:04,429
He wouIdn't have approved
-I got that feeling.

543
00:44:08,751 --> 00:44:11,520
-And your parents?
Pop's been gone for years

544
00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:12,982
Mom?

545
00:44:13,172 --> 00:44:17,360
She's still around.
She's too miserable to die

546
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:20,947
That generation's almost all gone

547
00:44:21,139 --> 00:44:26,199
When the last one goes, we become
the old folks at the family functions.

548
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,663
What are you saying?
We're still kids.

549
00:44:29,812 --> 00:44:31,333
Don't you believe it, Tony

550
00:44:31,524 --> 00:44:35,919
When the last one dies, it signals
the start of the last stretch for us.

551
00:44:36,112 --> 00:44:40,297
Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking
to go anytime soon, it's just ....

552
00:44:42,158 --> 00:44:45,305
Just feels funny now, being

553
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:47,600
an elder

554
00:44:55,797 --> 00:44:58,234
Your end of the demonstration bust-up

555
00:45:08,184 --> 00:45:10,455
Massarone gave me five no-shows

556
00:45:10,603 --> 00:45:13,820
Two and a half each
-Three-two.

557
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:17,627
It should be 3-2, my way.
I gotta kick upstairs to Uncle Junior

558
00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:21,214
-Two and a half each.
All your guys are in on this shit

559
00:45:21,408 --> 00:45:24,968
People find out I'm making money
on their blood, it's my ass.

560
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,723
Hell, no. Three-two
-I'II think about it.

561
00:45:31,417 --> 00:45:34,602
What about the asbestos
removal project at the school?

562
00:45:34,752 --> 00:45:36,981
Just waiting to see who gets the bid

563
00:45:38,713 --> 00:45:39,986
/-\|| right

564
00:45:42,216 --> 00:45:43,614
Hey, rev

565
00:45:45,596 --> 00:45:47,451
Sorry about your old man

566
00:45:50,433 --> 00:45:51,831
(PHoNE)

567
00:45:55,563 --> 00:45:56,711
Hello?

568
00:45:59,443 --> 00:46:01,924
He did? Where is he now?

569
00:46:02,196 --> 00:46:03,300
(|=>HoNE RINGING)

570
00:46:07,658 --> 00:46:08,556
Hello?

571
00:46:08,704 --> 00:46:11,765
-Ch, you're home!
How dare you call here

572
00:46:11,955 --> 00:46:14,310
I called now on purpose

573
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:16,772
I know Johnny's at work

574
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:19,650
Anthony," your son, Anthony

575
00:46:19,254 --> 00:46:20,859
He harbors resentment

576
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:26,449
I'm hanging up

577
00:46:26,595 --> 00:46:28,533
I just want you to know.

578
00:46:28,681 --> 00:46:32,411
...what pennies I have
I leave to the children.

579
00:46:32,601 --> 00:46:35,289
Your children and Barbara's children

580
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:39,200
I raised three children of my own

581
00:46:39,151 --> 00:46:42,922
I did a pretty good--
pretty good job on two

582
00:46:47,866 --> 00:46:49,805
Be veiy careful.

583
00:46:49,952 --> 00:46:52,140
She's a real snake in the grass

584
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:54,101
She has no work ethic

585
00:46:54,247 --> 00:46:55,227
Why is that?

586
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,646
If anything happens to me

587
00:46:58,751 --> 00:47:01,608
Hello? Hello?

588
00:47:05,967 --> 00:47:07,698
(KNGCKING )

589
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:13,367
Where is he?
Did you call an ambulance?

590
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,454
I don't need no fucking ambulance
- (Bacala) See?

591
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:21,294
Yeah, sure. Look at you

592
00:47:21,486 --> 00:47:24,961
We're going to the emergency room
-Fuck that. I'm all right.

593
00:47:25,155 --> 00:47:27,383
Why not go down there and make sure?

594
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,308
Uncle Jun?

595
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:43,316
Hey, you still here?

596
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:50,990
I'II drive you. Bacala will come

00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:53,911
Yeah, sure

Help me up

599
00:47:56,976 --> 00:47:58,415
Can you walk?

600
00:48:02,649 --> 00:48:03,754
Hold on a minute

601
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:08,505
I'II be okay.
Give me a minute to catch my breath

602
00:48:14,827 --> 00:48:15,891
/-\|| right

603
00:48:18,457 --> 00:48:20,229
What are you doing?

604
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:22,438
What do you want, a piggyback?

605
00:48:23,419 --> 00:48:24,441
Get the door

606
00:48:24,712 --> 00:48:26,569
Anthony!

607
00:48:26,717 --> 00:48:29,819
Don't let me go to my grave
with this guilt.

608
00:48:33,266 --> 00:48:36,159
Make things right with your mother
Please.
