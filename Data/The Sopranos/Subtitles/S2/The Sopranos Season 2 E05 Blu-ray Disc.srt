00:16:18,456 --> 00:16:20,559
Crossed the Iine on me once, Anthony

173
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:23,210
And I held my tongue

174
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,899
She may be your sister
But back the fuck off.

175
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:33,310
What do you know about respect?

176
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:35,750
I put you back in business, sucker

177
00:16:35,224 --> 00:16:38,869
Did you go see Beansie?
Fucking paraplegic?

178
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:45,430
Hey, I thought that was

179
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:47,336
Why did you take out a Ioan?

180
00:16:48,277 --> 00:16:49,756
-What?
You heard me

181
00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:52,924
What is it, his idea?
Like you could pay it back?

182
00:16:53,118 --> 00:16:55,593
I'm quite capable of getting a job
Tony.

183
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:58,346
With carpal tunnel syndrome?
You'II hold a beggar's cup?

184
00:16:58,538 --> 00:17:00,267
I never begged a day in my Iife

185
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,559
Right.
Fake disabilities don't count

186
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:07,897
I applied for the Ioan because I'm
trying to make this habitable for I\/Ia

187
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:15,238
l'II take care of the Ioan.
Don't worry. l'II give you the money

188
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:23,204
That's beautiful.
Stay as Iong as you like, Rich

189
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:25,750
She's your fucking problem now

190
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:33,297
This is a no-stopping zone, ma'am
The sign's right there.

191
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:37,928
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see it
I Ieft my glasses at home.

192
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:41,266
You need to wear them for driving

193
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:46,603
Now, into this mix comes
Brenda's husband, Omar..

194
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:50,482
who's just leaving the market
with a bag of oranges.

195
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:56,781
What's the trouble here, officer?

196
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:05,496
What are you doing?
You're dropping your oranges

197
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:10,587
Very good, Chris. Great improv

198
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:14,589
There we have it. Listen
Any questions?

199
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:19,510
Okay, then. Let's see what the pros
have to teach us.

200
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:21,974
For next time

201
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:24,685
Phil and Joanne

00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,897

The breast milk.
Un poco poco, Iittle each eye

208
00:19:01,495 --> 00:19:05,140
He tells me nothing.
Who's the zip, anyway?

209
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:11,189
He's a friend of ours
We'II talk Iater.

210
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:24,952
What's the matter?
-Nothing.

211
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,547
Come here

212
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:39,133
You having a good time?
Food's good, right?

213
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:43,720
Your home is spectacular
The television.

00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:52,522
The AIVIC, Two Women is on. La Loren

Tell them what your favorite TV
program is.

(SPEAKING IN ITALIAN )

218
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:09,578
-Oh, look who it is.
Christopher, how you doing, man!

219
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:13,582
-What are you doing here?
I come. Tony make a party for me

220
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:16,294
Furio, come here.
I want you to meet somebody

221
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:17,548
Scusa

222
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:21,300
What the fuck? Is he on vacation?

223
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,385
Yeah, he saw a travel poster
for sunny New Jersey.

224
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:25,848
He's with us now?

225
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,807
lVlmm

226
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:29,601
Guess I didn't get the memo

227
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:32,102
Would you have read it if you got one?

228
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:36,479
Where the fuck you been?
Did you talk to the tanning salon guy?

229
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:39,736
He only had half
-Again?

230
00:20:39,927 --> 00:20:43,153
If you ask me, it's that Chinese cunt
he's married to.

231
00:20:43,346 --> 00:20:46,284
-Bad influence.
She's a Filipino

232
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:49,454
I wasn't sure what you wanted

233
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:51,913
Send him a past-due note
What do you think?

234
00:20:57,984 --> 00:20:59,632
You know

235
00:21:00,278 --> 00:21:01,717
You know what?

236
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:03,928
Leave it alone

237
00:21:04,116 --> 00:21:06,889
You sure?
-Yeah.

238
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:13,143
-Carmela.
What do you want?

239
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:16,605
I brought some cookies, pignolis

240
00:21:16,964 --> 00:21:20,691
Our relative from the other side
is here, I should pay respect.

241
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:27,617
What did you say about glass?

242
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:30,953
Collection, I said. I have one

243
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:35,810
Know what I judge
to be the trouble with you?

244
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:39,712
Inferiority complex.
Know what that is?

245
00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:43,631
That's what they call it when
someone Iow-rates himself.

246
00:21:43,783 --> 00:21:48,969
For instance, that ciumping you
thought was so awful in high school

247
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:51,806
You gave up your education
for a clump.

248
00:21:51,998 --> 00:21:55,102
A Iittle physical defect
is what you have.

249
00:21:58,253 --> 00:21:59,858
A Iittle physical defect?

250
00:22:01,884 --> 00:22:05,700
-You were doing so good.
It doesn't make any sense!

251
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,406
The guy's a player
and he wants to fuck her?

252
00:22:07,598 --> 00:22:09,908
Where does it say he's trying
to fuck her?

253
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:13,662
-Please.
IVIaybe he is not

254
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:17,248
You ever think that's why he's
the "GentIeman CaIIer"?

255
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:20,335
IVIaybe he's a gentleman
-He's a douche bag.

256
00:22:23,696 --> 00:22:25,924
-So quit.
I'm not gonna quit

257
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:33,431
-I Iike you as an actor.
Joe Pesci or something

258
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:42,231
Let it be known from this day forth
lawlessness will not be tolerated."

259
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,738
Jimmy Hollywood. Come on!

260
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:49,533
Hey, Tony

261
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,702
l'II be a few minutes.
Fix something to drink

262
00:22:56,394 --> 00:22:57,666
What's up?

263
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:05,212
Guy named Danny Greco called
for a Ioan. Said you'II vouch.

264
00:23:05,405 --> 00:23:08,424
For Danny? Yeah.
I told you Danny was good

265
00:23:08,575 --> 00:23:10,802
-Oh, yeah?
Yeah, at the steak house

266
00:23:10,993 --> 00:23:11,888
-Yeah.
A few minutes

267
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:18,892
Since I'm here.
Can I talk to you about something?

268
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,742
On any fucking scale you
wanna use, things are going good

269
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:40,800
I'm firmly in charge, no trouble
there. lVly family is healthy. Right?

270
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:44,502
So why am I ripping phones
out of the wall in front of my kid?

271
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:47,963
And screaming at my sister,
although she's unimportant to me

272
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:49,426
Got a Iot on your mind

273
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:51,885
Because I'm the boss?
-Yeah.

274
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,974
That's the point

275
00:23:55,122 --> 00:23:58,933
You never saw Carlo or Lucky
or Douglas IVlacArthur...

276
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:05,984
What if I said I saw a shrink?

277
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:08,361
I had an inkling

278
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:22,958
Every once in a while
I get anxious...

279
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:26,200
you know, just in general
No reason.

280
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:29,755
I'm in my kitchen.
AII of a sudden I can't breathe, right?

281
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:33,300
I'm suffocating. I get
to the point where I pass out

282
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:34,388
Hmph

283
00:24:34,744 --> 00:24:36,680
Just Iike your father
-What is?

284
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,516
-He had the same thing.
He had anxiety attacks?

285
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,393
Well, in those days we called it
a "condition."

286
00:24:42,543 --> 00:24:44,397
Didn't happen often, once a year

287
00:24:44,543 --> 00:24:46,149
Holy shit

288
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:49,150
He cracked his head open
on a cigarette machine.

289
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:52,402
-Did he go to a doctor?
Your father? Are you kidding?

290
00:24:52,596 --> 00:24:56,310
Wouldn't have mattered.
They didn't know how to treat it

291
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:57,660
They're not much better now

292
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:01,204
There's an article in the Times
They got this machine.

293
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:04,332
It can see images of the brain
and how it...

294
00:25:04,482 --> 00:25:05,918
responds to fear
-Fear?

295
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:09,503
A person, listening to a
tape of a parent criticizing

296
00:25:09,695 --> 00:25:11,508
I'm talking about an adult

297
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:16,900
...their fear center kicks right in.
You can actually see it in an IVIRI

298
00:25:24,627 --> 00:25:26,896
I had this weird dream
the other night--

299
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:32,401
I'm telling you, they used
my ass to invent some new tests

300
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:37,198
I was at the beach.
But I had a suit on, and shoes too

301
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:39,784
Camera up your ass
the size of a garden hose

302
00:25:39,935 --> 00:25:42,203
Want to hear this dream?
-All right.

303
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:51,547
-Got a sec?
Sure, what's up?

304
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:58,100
It's my scene. Gentleman CaIIer guy
It's not me.

305
00:25:58,162 --> 00:26:01,560
It's not supposed to be.
That's why they call it acting

306
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:05,768
I know, it'sjust ....
I'd rather do something else

307
00:26:08,297 --> 00:26:10,939
Cynthia too. They're cool with it
-All right.

308
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:15,820
AIan's partner dropped out,
so I gotta find something for him

309
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:20,785
Rebel Without A Cause

310
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:23,203
-James Dean.
Copy it for the others

311
00:26:23,393 --> 00:26:24,539
Get comfortable with it

312
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:28,414
-It's great. Cool.
I don't want a James Dean impression

313
00:26:28,564 --> 00:26:30,796
Yeah. No

314
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:43,973
Poor creatures. You are such
poor creatures. Yes.

315
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:49,814
Don't give them that shit!

316
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:52,734
They nke it

317
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:55,778
What'd I tell you? He's gonna choke!

318
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:58,406
Little pieces. They're hungry

319
00:26:58,597 --> 00:27:00,865
For fucking cheese doodles
they're not!

320
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:05,871
You know everything!
-Yeah, I do.

321
00:27:15,904 --> 00:27:16,799
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN )

322
00:27:16,904 --> 00:27:17,885
You too

323
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:21,136
Date an American,
that's what you get

324
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:24,138
I should introduce you
to my brother.

325
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,309
If I wanted a factory worker, I
wouId've stayed in Kazakhstan

326
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:35,317
Lot of fucking words for nothing

327
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:39,445
He said, if I don't like to fight,
I should find myself a Russian

328
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,745
Got a problem, besides those pants?!

329
00:27:46,936 --> 00:27:49,456
You shouIdn't yeII
-Oh, yeah?

330
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,960
I make business. She's nice
-Are you a counselor?

331
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:55,754
Want to get involved in problems?

332
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:58,600
-IVly testicles!
Now you're involved

333
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:01,760
These are balls, right?
-Yes.

334
00:28:01,952 --> 00:28:05,261
Do something! You wanted to be
involved, now you are!

335
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:07,850
You Iet go! We'II call police

336
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:13,355
You. We call police!
-Fuck you!

337
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:33,669
Fuck!

338
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:38,254
Get your shit, we're going
Come on.

339
00:28:42,448 --> 00:28:44,950
IVIove your ass!

340
00:28:48,706 --> 00:28:51,476
Why do you always
have to ruin everything?

341
00:28:51,498 --> 00:28:52,312
Huh?

342
00:28:54,752 --> 00:28:56,399
Just move your ass

343
00:28:57,172 --> 00:29:01,237
Help me, Daddy. Daddy

344
00:29:01,387 --> 00:29:06,406
You can depend on me, trust me.
Whatever comes, we'II face together

345
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:15,790
Fuck this shit!
You said you weren't gonna Iaugh!

346
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,715
I didn't Iaugh.
Baby, you were doing so good

347
00:29:22,906 --> 00:29:27,540
Yeah, fuck this
-Christopher!

348
00:29:28,744 --> 00:29:31,184
(TV B|_AR|No )

349
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:36,436
Absolutely not.
Do the work you were assigned

350
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:38,149
How about where I'm scared

351
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:41,775
and dive out of the car before
Buzz goes off the cliff?

352
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:45,153
There's no dialogue in that scene
-The knife fight?

353
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:47,324
No. I already changed it once

354
00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:50,493
I gave you the scene
because it's challenging

355
00:29:51,434 --> 00:29:53,165
This Russian fuck!

356
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:55,332
Lucky I didn't get hauled in

357
00:29:55,483 --> 00:29:58,667
It wouId've played great with Junior
and everybody else!

358
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:02,297

Ieisure-time activities.

360
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:06,551
Carmeia wouId've known who
was on the boat.

361
00:30:06,702 --> 00:30:11,805
That's nothing new. Or my kids
-It happens, okay?

362
00:30:14,793 --> 00:30:17,978
-What's wrong with me?
You got some kind of complex

363
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,522
-What kind?
You know, sleep always helps

364
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:22,650
You wanna go to sleep? Go!
-Hey!

365

-Jesus Christ!
Easy does it, Iaddie buck

366
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:32,743
I was never good with my fist
but there was one guy.

367
00:30:32,936 --> 00:30:36,914
Almost drove me to murder
-Lately, I feel this...

368
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:40,543
aversion to my swimming pool
Depresses me.

369
00:30:40,694 --> 00:30:43,211
The sucker was a sound engineer
at my studio.

370
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:45,173
Talked about Germany aII the time

371
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:46,926
I find myself avoiding the yard

372
00:30:47,117 --> 00:30:50,177
He wasn't a Nazi, he just rubbed
me the wrong way.

373
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:52,139
One time I pulled into a parking lot

374
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:53,682
and he was two spots over

375
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:58,170
...rotating his tires.
Like it was a goddamn service station

376
00:30:59,252 --> 00:31:00,691
So, I said to him

377
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:06,610
Straight back. Back as far as
they could take me.

378
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:11,743
And then, it aII dissolved

379
00:31:12,515 --> 00:31:15,790
Everything dissolved

380
00:31:15,937 --> 00:31:19,207
That's it. That's the end
-Very good, Omar.

381
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:24,254
Just say "scene" when
you're done, okay?

382
00:31:24,444 --> 00:31:26,465
Chris, IVlitch, Cynthia and

383
00:31:26,613 --> 00:31:30,302
Alan. Our "rebels without causes

384
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:35,570
Okay, so we are at the pianetarium

385
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:37,101
Alan is Jim's friend

386
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,395
...Plato, who is about to get
mistakenly shot by the police

387
00:31:41,544 --> 00:31:42,733
lVlitch is his father

388
00:31:42,882 --> 00:31:46,660
And Cynthia is his troubled friend
Judy.

00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:53,160
Shut the lights!

390
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:58,369
IVIake them go away! Keep away from
me! I don't believe you anymore!

391
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:00,959
Gunshot!
-Jim!

392
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:06,421
I got the bullets! Look!
-Oh, God!

393
00:32:07,445 --> 00:32:08,925
And the cops swarm in

394
00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:14,510
Let him alone! That's my son. When
I saw the red jacket, I thought ....

395
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:19,100
Hey, jerkpot,
what'd you do that for?

396
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:23,270
You can't help it, son.
You did everything a man could

397
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:32,310
Help me, Daddy!

398
00:32:32,845 --> 00:32:36,869
Dad, help me. Daddy!

399
00:32:37,184 --> 00:32:40,497
You can depend on me. Trust me

we'II face it together

401
00:32:44,274 --> 00:32:47,672
It's okay, Jim. Stand up

402
00:32:49,987 --> 00:32:51,801

403
00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:54,134
And l'II try to be as strong
as you want me to be.

Dad. This is Judy
She's my friend.

408
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:41,184
Un-freaking-believable!

00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:42,727
God, you were really good

410
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,439
Great job, Chris

411
00:34:12,571 --> 00:34:14,925
You wanna watch your ashes, please?

412
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:22,976
I'II be outside

413
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,200
We should hit a Devil's game
some night.

414
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:30,650
Still get tickets from the Greek?

415
00:34:30,256 --> 00:34:32,943
-Right on the ice.
I'|I bring my sweater

416
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:36,572
Hey, chef of the future

417
00:34:36,718 --> 00:34:38,408
Have a seat

418
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:42,743
How you doing, Foodio?
-"Furio."

419
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:50,583
You didn't
stomp those grapes yourself?

420
00:34:54,278 --> 00:34:55,591
Look at this group

421
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,218
Hey, lVlr. New York. What did you do
swim across that river?

422
00:35:00,412 --> 00:35:04,139
Come over here. Congratulations
-Thanks.

423
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:08,437
Hey, don't get up
-I wasn't gonna.

424
00:35:08,627 --> 00:35:11,481
-Piece of shit.
Say hello to Furio

425
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:13,942
Friend of ours, from the other side

426
00:35:16,178 --> 00:35:20,864
Oh, hey. I heard a Iot about you
-Nice to meet you.

427
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:32,128
So, what's up?

428
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:37,800
Puss

429
00:35:37,405 --> 00:35:38,717
Wanna give us a minute?

430
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:48,976
I'm in the middle of eating
-I know.

431
00:35:50,837 --> 00:35:53,480
Do me a favor, will you, sweetie?
-Yes?

432
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,819
Keep this warm. Thank you

433
00:35:56,966 --> 00:35:58,737
Five minutes. All right?

434
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,829
I gotta make a call anyway

435
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:15,836

-What'd I say?

436

441
00:36:33,129 --> 00:36:36,189
If ever there's a guy in desperate
need of a nickname.

442
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:39,192
At Ieast he's Italian.
Try getting passed for a Samoan

443
00:36:39,345 --> 00:36:42,528

he's in charge.

there's no honor.

I'm thinking about taking
my patient back.

453

It's a serious decision
He's my responsibility

454
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,238
Elliot, I abandoned him

Do you realize what I did Iast week?

458
00:37:32,564 --> 00:37:37,333
I stormed out of here Iike a child
Cursing, threatening, acting out.

459
00:37:37,484 --> 00:37:40,500
That's exactly what he does to me

460
00:37:44,531 --> 00:37:47,138
I'm feeling so

461
00:37:59,757 --> 00:38:02,193
I don't know where this
is coming from.

462
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:10,492
You mentioned you've put on
a Iittle weight...

463
00:38:10,683 --> 00:38:14,165
lately. Do you think

464
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:17,374
the overeating has to do
with your patient?

465
00:38:20,778 --> 00:38:25,890
What is it you're not telling me?
-I don't know.

466
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:30,639
I don't know what you mean

You know, we spoke Iast time about
childhood fascinations with danger.

472
00:38:57,565 --> 00:39:01,000
I think seeing him again will be
very therapeutic for me.

473
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:05,400
It's not supposed to be therapeutic
for you. This is your therapy.

474
00:39:10,243 --> 00:39:12,638
Do you have sexual feelings for him?

475
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,942
I have feelings. On a personal level

476
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,447
He can be such a Iittle boy sometimes

477
00:39:29,722 --> 00:39:32,282

514
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,347
IVlitch, Christopher,
you wanna give it a try?

515
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,849
-Come on, Chris!
Your girlfriend's gonna be pissed

516
00:43:42,264 --> 00:43:43,619
Stop it, Christopher!

517
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:47,122
This is inappropriate!
We do not hit!

518
00:43:48,687 --> 00:43:50,417
Come on! Knock it off!

519
00:43:52,315 --> 00:43:53,337
OH, IVIY GOD

520
00:43:53,943 --> 00:43:56,714
Are you okay? Are you aII right?

521
00:44:00,865 --> 00:44:01,680
Ah!

522
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,181
I\/ly God, sorry

523
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:06,476
I think it's broken

524
00:44:06,706 --> 00:44:08,143
We should get you to a doctor

525
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,811
There's nothing they can do

526
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,190
I don't understand.
The guy didn't say anything?

527
00:44:15,342 --> 00:44:19,527
He didn't have to. That was the point
of the whole exercise.

528
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,323
But he didn't flip you off
You said so yourself.

529
00:44:24,851 --> 00:44:28,744
IVIaybe doing that scene brought up
some bad feelings.

530
00:44:28,894 --> 00:44:30,248
What scene?
-You know...

531
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:31,917
where he was your father

532
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:34,440
You said the class aII clapped

533
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:35,713
I was fucking acting

534
00:44:35,902 --> 00:44:38,714
I was better than IVlitch
Even I knew that.

535
00:44:38,907 --> 00:44:43,425
IVIaybe he reminded you of your father
and that's why you got so into it.

536
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,928
IVIaybe that's why you hit him tonight
-IVIy father?

537
00:44:47,122 --> 00:44:49,682
Those feelings about how
he died so young.

538
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:53,645
-Oh, fuck that.
Well, acting is mostly feelings

539
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,523
Unless the actor is driving a car
or fighting or something.

540
00:44:58,301 --> 00:45:01,319
You want to write?
Feelings is what it's aII about

541
00:45:01,513 --> 00:45:04,447
Revealing your innermost feelings
is the best writing.

542
00:45:04,597 --> 00:45:07,760
How do you know what it's aII about?

543
00:45:07,225 --> 00:45:09,287
From writing orders at the restaurant?

544
00:45:10,518 --> 00:45:11,499
Ow!

545
00:45:11,856 --> 00:45:14,874
-Take it easy!
Your thing with scriptwriting

546
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,923
I hated seeing you suffer with
that writer's block.

547
00:45:23,449 --> 00:45:25,511
I had to get it for your birthday

548
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,140
I'm sorry

549
00:45:29,454 --> 00:45:31,977
Adrian, I'm sorry!

550
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:15,436
Are you still taking your medication?

551
00:46:20,296 --> 00:46:21,610
Off and on

552
00:46:22,884 --> 00:46:25,695
You should either take it
or don't take it. Okay?

553
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:40,879
that Ied to an auto accident

554
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,758
That seems Iike years ago

555
00:46:44,947 --> 00:46:47,510
You mean, you're so busy?

556
00:46:47,702 --> 00:46:51,637
Or you mean you're angry with me
for not agreeing to treat you?

557
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:06,237
I found out a Iittle medical history

558
00:47:06,844 --> 00:47:08,948
I\/Iy old man had the same thing

559
00:47:09,139 --> 00:47:11,992
Panic attacks,
followed by passing out

560
00:47:12,142 --> 00:47:14,203
Cracked his head on
a cigarette machine.

561
00:47:14,393 --> 00:47:17,499
-Interesting.
Interesting?

562
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:21,917
That's it? You're not gonna send me
for a fucking test?

563
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:29,510
Anthony, what is it
you want to achieve here?

564
00:47:32,244 --> 00:47:33,557
What do I want to achieve?

565
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:40,220
I want to stop passing out

566
00:47:40,336 --> 00:47:42,315
I want to stop fucking panicking

567
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:49,695
I want to direct my power and anger
against the people that deserve it.

568
00:47:54,351 --> 00:47:58,204
I want to be in total control
-There's no such thing.

569
00:47:58,355 --> 00:48:00,874
-Of course there is.
Want to be a better leader?

570
00:48:03,442 --> 00:48:06,297
You know what? Fuck you

571
00:48:06,447 --> 00:48:10,925
You know who I am, and you know
what I do. You called me.

572
00:48:16,205 --> 00:48:17,975
Know where I was when you called?

573
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:20,980
I don't know

574
00:48:23,171 --> 00:48:25,440
At a whorehouse, while
a guy working for me...

575
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,277
...was beating a guy
that owes me money

576
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,779
Broke his arm.
Put a bullet in his kneecap

577
00:48:39,603 --> 00:48:41,291
How'd that make you feel?

578
00:48:42,814 --> 00:48:44,419
Wished it was me in there

579
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:46,963
Giving the beating or taking it?

580
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:44,873
(JAZZ soNo |=>|_AY|No )
