1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,500
# You woke up
this morning #

2
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:14,900
# Got yourself a gun #

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,750
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

4
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:22,500
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

5
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:24,765
# You've got
to burn to shine #

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,800
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,650
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

8
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:33,492
# When you
woke up this morning #

9
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:36,513
# And all that love
had gone #

10
00:00:36,548 --> 00:00:39,500
# Your papa never
told you about #

11
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:41,965
# Right and wrong #

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,300
# But you're...
you're lookin' good, baby #

13
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,867
# I believe that
you're feelin' fine #

14
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:49,400
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

15
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:51,865
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,100
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,700
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
# Woke up this morning #

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,500
# You say you woke up
this morning #

20
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:08,200
# The world
turned upside down #

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,500
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

22
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:13,765
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,200
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

24
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:18,600
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,700
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

26
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:24,700
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

27
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:27,665
# Woke up
this morning #

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,865
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,900
- # Woke up this morning #
- # Got yourself a gun #

30
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:36,400
- # Uh-huh #
- # Got yourself a gun. #

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,100
- Dad.
- Hey.

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,100
What are
you doing here?

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, I got
an office here.

34
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,600
- You come down with Finn?
- And some people.

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,000
Promise me no drinkin'
and drivin'.

36
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,800
Who's your
designated driver?

37
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,500
I'm not the one with all
the dents in their car.

38
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:23,100
All right,
have fun, huh?

39
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:25,165
Need some money?

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,700
Have a good time,
sweetheart.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,900
Be careful!

42
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,900
- You see Meadow?
- Yeah, I wish I knew she was here.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,800
I wonder what the fuck
she's thinkin'.

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm sorry, Ton'. Some kid
had a seizure upstairs,

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
- it's been a horrible night.
- Hey, Ton',

46
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,300
Vito and Gene just called,
they're five minutes away.

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
We're leaving.

48
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,900
Here. All right, call 'em
and tell 'em to meet us

49
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:58,800
at Bud's Butter Bun
on Broadway and 18th.

50
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:01,700
All right.

51
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,000
Did I just
see your father?

52
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,200
He's got
an office here.

53
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,600
Saturday night?

54
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:16,865
That's dedication.

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,900
The guy sure can
put in the hours.

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,865
Let's go
someplace else.

57
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,600
Tony's spendin'
so much time at the club.

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,300
Do you think that might have
something to do with you?

59
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,965
Oh, if you think
I'm gonna blow this guy

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
for your sick purposes
you are sadly mistaken.

61
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
So go on about this phone call
the other night.

62
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,600
It was just some guy
with a Southern accent.

63
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,400
Christopher
grabbed the phone,

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,265
he yelled at him
for callin' the house,

65
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,400
- said he'd see him down there.
- Down where?

66
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:50,200
Did you check
the log on his cell?

67
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,200
Not since I almost
got caught doin' that,

68
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:53,965
and I am not
doin' it again.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,650
Wait till he goes
into the shower.

70
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:59,265
See if there's
a 4-0-4 or 3-3-6,

71
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,800
and memorize any other numbers
you don't recognize.

72
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,800
- What's the matter?
- I got to go to the bathroom.

73
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:09,900
- I know, you said.
- No, I-I got to go.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,100
- Number two.
- I'll take you to your car.

75
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:17,300
No, I got to go now.
Oh my God.

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,465
You okay?

77
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,600
We're almost there.

78
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,600
Try to relax.

79
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't you got a general
anesthetic or somethin'?

80
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,000
This lidocaine
doesn't do much.

81
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:34,300
We are... done.

82
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,800
Jan, want to do
your thing?

83
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,350
Just keep
a little pressure.

84
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:45,592
All right.
I'm gonna get this

85
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:47,800
down to the lab,
see what's what.

86
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,065
Okay.

87
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,900
There we go.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,600
- You okay?
- You think he got it all?

89
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,800
We hope so. Meantime,
there's a canteen on Level L.

90
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:02,200
I'll let you know when
the results come back.

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,100
Does having a bowel movement
relieve the pain?

92
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:11,065
Yeah.

93
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,600
Would you describe
the diarrhea

94
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:15,667
- as loose or liquid?
- Liquid.

95
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:17,700
But this is gettin'
so I'm afraid

96
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,100
to be away
from the toilet.

97
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm so scared
I'm gonna have an accident.

98
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:24,000
- Is this tender?
- No.

99
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Sit up.

100
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,800
- How's your personal life?
- What do you mean?

101
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:39,865
Well, sometimes GI disturbances
are stress-related.

102
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,100
Is there anything unusual
that might be giving you the jimjams?

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,000
I just want somethin'
for my stomach

104
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,800
so I can quit
goin' to the bathroom.

105
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:52,665
That's what's
givin' me stress.

106
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Why don't you get dressed?
We'll talk in my office.

107
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,400
I hear you're spending time
with today's youth.

108
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:05,565
You lost me.

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,700
Meadow said she saw you
at Adriana's club.

110
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,700
I got to explain my business to you now?
After so many years?

111
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:15,167
- No, it's your life, Tony.
- Got that right.

112
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:18,565
What did you do to your head?
Did you fall again?

113
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,200
Banged it on the medicine chest.
Don't worry 'bout it.

114
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:24,500
It's nothin'.
There's your allowance.

115
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,900
Now that actually
looks like fruit.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,900
Yeah, it's so hard.

117
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,200
What do you
do it for?

118
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,200
Irritable bowel syndrome?

119
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,200
He'll know more when
the tests come back.

120
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,600
I still got to bring him
a stool sample.

121
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,165
Jesus, please.

122
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,300
You were the one who yelled
at me to go to the doctor.

123
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:03,765
I got to know
every detail?

124
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,665
I could be really sick,
Christopher.

125
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah, my Aunt Josephine
had colon cancer.

126
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,950
Her whole asshole
rotted out.

127
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:13,800
I may have
to go into therapy.

128
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,800
Plus, they're gonna
put me on Prozac.

129
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,865
For diarrhea?

130
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,200
To help me cope
and handle stress,

131
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,300
which is a lot
of what causes it.

132
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:25,300
What do you got to
be stressed about?

133
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:27,565
That bar?

134
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,800
War, Christopher?

135
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:31,965
The Middle East?

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,965
You don't listen
to the President?

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,600
We're gonna mop the floor
with the whole fuckin' world.

138
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,800
The whole world's
gonna be under our control,

139
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:40,800
so what are you
worked up about?

140
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, give me the Orioles
over the Tigers for two,

141
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,400
and the Jays over
the Rangers, three G's.

142
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,400
I'm just gettin'
my day planner.

143
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:10,600
No, I'm done.

144
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,265
My stupid car.

145
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,800
5,000 miles
and the alternator's goin'.

146
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,000
What about you?
Mimi said you went to the doctor.

147
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:30,167
I've been havin'
trouble with my stomach,

148
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:32,300
that's why I'm drinkin'
White Russians.

149
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:35,317
What, you got
ulcers already?

150
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:38,300
- It's called IBS.
- What's that?

151
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,800
Irritable bowel syndrome.

152
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,200
My mother had that
all her life.

153
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,600
See this?

154
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,400
- Yeah, I noticed that. What happened?
- It's cancer.

155
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,650
- What?
- Yeah, squamous.

156
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:58,765
Oh my God,
that's terrible.

157
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,300
Well, they think they got it all.
Knock wood.

158
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:02,900
Just cancer.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,300
The things that run
through your head, you know?

160
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:09,300
- Sure.
- I got a top guy, though...

161
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:11,365
Katz.

162
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Hesh recommended him,
naturally.

163
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,965
So this...

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,900
disease you got.

165
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,800
What causes it?

166
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,600
I did a Google on it
and like the doctor, too.

167
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:27,600
They all say a lot
of it's psychological.

168
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,100
So on top of everything,
now I'm a head case.

169
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,100
No, come on,
stop blamin' yourself.

170
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Christopher
don't want to know,

171
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,000
but not that I blame him.

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,365
I got to take off.

173
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,000
AJ should be comin' home
from his volleyball thing.

174
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,965
Listen, don't say
anything to anybody, okay?

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,800
People hear cancer,
they start to bury you already.

176
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:02,300
And you don't tell
anybody what I told you.

177
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,600
All right, take care
of yourself.

178
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:08,765
Say hi to Anthony.

179
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,900
- Yeah.
- You're such a good father.

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,900
I wish my dad
had been like that.

181
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,200
Good night, dear.

182
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
It's a straight shot
on I-95 to Raleigh.

183
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,117
You give this shit
to the fence,

184
00:10:24,152 --> 00:10:26,065
I'll meet you
in Winston-Salem,

185
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,900
we'll load up the cigs
and come home.

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,665
We're pickin' up
so many cigarettes,

187
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,300
why don't we instead of two vans
rent a deuce and a half?

188
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:34,265
You know,
share the drivin'.

189
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,465
Because the cops...
The van's under the radar.

190
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,600
- Eric Estrada over here.
- You forgot your folic acid.

191
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,950
What is
all this stuff?

192
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:45,200
A beauty parlor chair?

193
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,665
If they even heard of
electrolysis down there.

194
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,100
- Where are you goin'?
- Jesus Christ, go back to bed.

195
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:53,167
What the fuck's
your problem?

196
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:55,165
My fuckin' tooth
is killin' me.

197
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,600
Well, you should
go back to the dentist.

198
00:10:57,635 --> 00:10:59,565
Why do you have
to go anyway?

199
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,400
Can't they just
drop this stuff off?

200
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,600
Tony wants me to talk
to the guy down there.

201
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,600
The jerk you were
yellin' at on the phone?

202
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,500
Is that the cigarette thing
you were talkin' about?

203
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,000
Six different kinds of dope you get
to take for a stomach-ache,

204
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,600
I got an impaction, I can't take shit
besides oil of clove, 'cause I'm sober.

205
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:19,100
I know, it's hard. I'm sorry.
Have a nice trip.

206
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,500
- I love you, call me.
- She's got diarrhea.

207
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,200
Whoops.

208
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,165
You want?

209
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,400
Aw, twist my arm.

210
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,600
I'm expectin' some guys
from New York, so...

211
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:47,800
No problem.
I got plenty to do out there.

212
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,850
- Ah. Who's this on?
- Please. It's called "The Lost Boys. "

213
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:57,100
Sil's been raggin' on me all week
for me to play 'em here.

214
00:11:57,135 --> 00:11:59,700
Their manager or somebody
owes him money.

215
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,600
So, I thought
this was your day off.

216
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,065
Chrissy's away.

217
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,500
I don't like
stayin' home alone.

218
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Although, at least
I can pour a glass of wine

219
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
without him givin' me
"the expression. "

220
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,300
Yeah. Yeah, I know
that look.

221
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:21,900
The constipated owl look.

222
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,000
You know, when I first
met you I was scared of you.

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,700
Really?

224
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,400
Yeah, but I'm scared
of everybody.

225
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,800
It's always
my first reaction.

226
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, you're not scared
of me now, are you?

227
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:49,000
No.

228
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,300
You want to shoot?

229
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:57,200
Huh?

230
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,600
Make it interesting,
say a buck a game.

231
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,500
Mmm?

232
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,300
No, it's the round thing
in the middle there.

233
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,150
How you feelin'?
Everything all right in here now?

234
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:25,500
- Your stomach all right?
- I know what you're doin'.

235
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:27,500
Don't distract me.

236
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,400
Oh.

237
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,765
- Ho!
- Hmm.

238
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,500
I've been hustled.

239
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,800
- Did I get your toe?
- No. No, no, no.

240
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:46,700
I'm so sorry.

241
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,800
Come on, get up.
Come on.

242
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,150
Aw, shit.

243
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,800
All right.

244
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,000
Wait.

245
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, go on.

246
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,600
- Tony here?
- Yeah, come on in.

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,200
Hey.

248
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,765
Let me know
if you guys need anything.

249
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,200
What, are you gonna tell me
about the traffic again?

250
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:38,400
Here, our friend
sent this for you.

251
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,200
Thank you for taking
the appointment.

252
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,100
And I know
I'm on probation,

253
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:48,900
and I deeply regret...

254
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:51,200
what I did.

255
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,900
My nephew's fiancee.

256
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,500
I know what
you're thinking.

257
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,265
So?

258
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,200
Well, nothing happened,

259
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,200
but it could've
very easily.

260
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,700
I mean,
she really got to me,

261
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,900
this young lady.
She, uh...

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,865
What?

263
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,500
This is
a very big step.

264
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,365
Yeah, tell me
about it.

265
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,000
I mean, that you've come here
to talk about this impulse

266
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,500
instead of just acting
on it without thinking.

267
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:39,200
No, I always think.

268
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,600
- Really?
- Yeah.

269
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,365
Having sex with
your mistress' cousin,

270
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,900
like the mistress wasn't enough
to piss off your wife.

271
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Tell me
about the niece.

272
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,100
She's drop-dead gorgeous.

273
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,650
Someone like her
I could...

274
00:17:02,685 --> 00:17:05,142
I could do it
right this time,

275
00:17:05,177 --> 00:17:07,600
I could start
a whole new family.

276
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
I'm young enough.

277
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Fuck 'em all.

278
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,000
And this is something
you're contemplating?

279
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:22,200
What? It would be
a disaster

280
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:23,900
of major proportions.

281
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,965
Carmela... I'd get
hosed financially.

282
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,300
There would be no reasoning
with her after that.

283
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:31,665
And my nephew,
it would kill him...

284
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,500
after years of grooming him
to be my number two.

285
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,100
And it would be very bad
for the girl.

286
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:41,700
She doesn't
deserve that.

287
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,600
I mean, I'm not stupid.

288
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,900
I know part of it's this
father-figure thing...

289
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,100
you know, on account
of hers ran off.

290
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,600
It would be like committing
an act of symbolic incest.

291
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:55,400
Whatever.

292
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,750
Look, what am I
gonna do?

293
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:00,700
I got lucky
the first time,

294
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,700
'cause I was able
to control myself,

295
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,700
- but you only get one of those.
- Rationalizing.

296
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:09,300
"I can't control myself. "
You can.

297
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:11,265
I don't know.

298
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,400
It's different for women.
It's all about up here with them.

299
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,300
She could make
a play for you.

300
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,100
You might want
to think about

301
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,100
how you're going to establish
limits and boundaries.

302
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,565
For example,

303
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,500
you could tell her she
means a great deal to you,

304
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,400
but you think of her
as a daughter.

305
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,900
Even if I want to
fuck her brains out.

306
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:34,065
This is a milestone
for you.

307
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,800
You're at a very
important crossroads.

308
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,665
For once you want to avoid

309
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,365
doing something
you know is wrong

310
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,200
and would be destructive
both to yourself

311
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:47,800
and to the people
you care about.

312
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,950
That's growth.

313
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:51,965
That's progress.

314
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,150
Just tell me what
I'm supposed to do.

315
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:56,300
You have to be
honest with yourself.

316
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,300
I know this is
a powerful urge,

317
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
but if you can't
keep it in your pants,

318
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:02,900
you have to
stay away from her.

319
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,700
You know...

320
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,300
not long ago,

321
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,465
you stood
in my outer office.

322
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,200
I recall you used the words
"drop-dead gorgeous" about me

323
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:27,600
and how you
had to have me.

324
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,700
I said I wouldn't date you,
and look, you survived.

325
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
What a horrible
fucking job you have.

326
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,500
How do you do it?

327
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,000
But what happens
now is your choice.

328
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:43,665
Act and create
a bed of misery,

329
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,600
or you can look at this
as a chance to do something good.

330
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
You say
she respects you.

331
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,700
Be worthy of respect.

332
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,200
See if you can remain
a friend to this woman,

333
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,300
a help to her.

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You know,
Tony had ducks one time...

335
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,100
in his pool.

336
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,800
You need to find out
where Chris went.

337
00:20:16,835 --> 00:20:19,200
I'm getting
this vibe from him.

338
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:21,865
Who? Tony?

339
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,700
He's really nice.
He listens.

340
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:27,500
He's kind of attractive...

341
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,500
definitely an alpha male...

342
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,700
but what if Christopher
found out?

343
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:35,600
What?
I'm not gonna fuck him.

344
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,400
Then, what are you
talking about?

345
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,700
I love Christopher, and sooner
or later we're gonna get out

346
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,500
from under all this shit
and leave this fucking state.

347
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,200
Jesus Christ.
She's a good-looking woman,

348
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:49,200
and she wants
to fuck Barney Rubble?

349
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,900
"Well, we really don't know him.
He listens. "

350
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,400
Excuse me,
is this seat taken?

351
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,565
- Tony, hi.
- Hey. How you doing?

352
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,500
Well, why I'm here,
Patsy's bringing somebody by,

353
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:16,400
- I'm gonna need to use the office.
- No problem.

354
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,065
I made a resolution.

355
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,600
I got to start spending
a lot more time on the floor.

356
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,500
Crack the whip.

357
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,800
I'm beat,
tell you the truth.

358
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,800
I think I'm gonna grab
40 winks till Patsy gets here.

359
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,950
Wait, you don't have
Chrissy's cell, do you?

360
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:38,600
He called but he didn't
leave a new number.

361
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,200
He'll probably
try you again.

362
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,100
He's due back tomorrow.

363
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,800
Oh, excuse me.

364
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
- I'll come back.
- No, I'm all right.

365
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,900
This mole back there looked
irregular around the margins.

366
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:18,100
Every time I see anything now,
I think I got melanoma.

367
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:20,100
I can imagine.

368
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,600
Hi, it's Adriana
at The Crazy Horse.

369
00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:28,700
Yeah, I need
a car, please.

370
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,500
Just tell him
to wait outside.

371
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,865
What, your car still?

372
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,100
Yeah, they're replacing
the alternator.

373
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:38,765
You want a belt?

374
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,200
What I could
really use is some...

375
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,165
I wouldn't say no.

376
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,900
Get me motivated
to clean the house

377
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,200
before Christopher gets back,
except I'm all out.

378
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,500
It's 2:00, Cross-Eyed Billy probably
left the Bing already.

379
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,400
I know a guy, Andre,
he's always up.

380
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,400
Well, cancel the car,
I'll give you a ride.

381
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,600
You know who thinks
you're cute...

382
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,665
is Marlene.

383
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,900
She's got to be over 30,
isn't she?

384
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,665
She's 31.

385
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,600
You know who you
ought to introduce me to

386
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,600
is that friend a yours.

387
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,365
Who?

388
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,800
The one you brought over
to the house that time.

389
00:23:29,835 --> 00:23:33,067
Tall, kind of blondish,
brownish hair...

390
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:36,300
- Danielle from Whippany.
- She's dead.

391
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,700
What?

392
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,500
Yeah, she drowned
on a picnic.

393
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,365
Oh.

394
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,400
You know, I thought I picked up on
something between her and me.

395
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
I'm not trying
to be conceited.

396
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,900
Tony!

397
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,965
I've reviewed your chart

398
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,700
and ruled out internal injuries,
so you're free to go.

399
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:34,400
I'll have the nurse
process your discharge orders.

400
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,600
Whoa, whoa.
This was a very bad accident.

401
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:40,900
Are you sure you
did all the tests?

402
00:24:40,935 --> 00:24:43,065
I can afford it.

403
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,065
I did the appropriate tests.

404
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,100
I have a medical degree
from Johns Hopkins.

405
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,600
My grandmother was
the first black woman licensed

406
00:24:49,635 --> 00:24:51,500
to practice medicine
in Delaware.

407
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,865
All right, take it easy.

408
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,165
The young lady
that I was with,

409
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,600
they said she was okay,
but could I see her?

410
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,700
Ade.

411
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

412
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,500
They say you're
gonna be fine,

413
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,100
they just want to keep
you here for observation.

414
00:25:18,135 --> 00:25:20,100
You know,
be on the safe side.

415
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,200
I don't even remember
what happened.

416
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,300
There was a raccoon
in the road,

417
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,600
I swerved.

418
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,800
- How's your car?
- Escalade?

419
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,965
It's totaled.

420
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,700
Probably saved our life.

421
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,700
Are you okay?

422
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,900
Yeah, they're gonna
let me go.

423
00:25:49,935 --> 00:25:52,500
I want to go too.

424
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,200
Chrissy's coming
home today.

425
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,900
We should probably
talk about that.

426
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,350
Oh.

427
00:26:05,385 --> 00:26:07,100
Yeah.

428
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,900
Right.

429
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,900
Dude, how you doing?

430
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,900
I hit the fucking
mother-lode.

431
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,300
20 Gs of product a week.
Little Paulie's behind me

432
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,465
- with the other half.
- Fuck me.

433
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,100
Now, 20% of this load, they can stamp
the packs for the vending machines.

434
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,900
The rest, the cartons can
go straight to the bodegas,

435
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,400
let them worry
about the stamps.

436
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,165
I'm beat.

437
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,800
I'm gonna hit
the fucking rack,

438
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,100
have Ade cook me up
a nice carbonara.

439
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,865
What's the matter?

440
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,600
Don't know how to tell you,
but Adriana's in the hospital.

441
00:26:54,635 --> 00:26:57,900
- She was in an accident.
- What? When?

442
00:26:57,935 --> 00:27:00,065
Last night
around 2:00.

443
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,700
Jesus Christ, what happened?
Is she all right?

444
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,000
She got banged up,
but she's gonna be okay.

445
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,600
The drinking and driving...
I told her!

446
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,100
- Where is she?
- Mount Mercy in Dover.

447
00:27:10,135 --> 00:27:12,567
- Dover?
- Apparently they swerved

448
00:27:12,602 --> 00:27:15,000
- to avoid a deer in the road.
- They?

449
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:18,917
- Her and Tony.
- Tony? Soprano?

450
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:22,765
- Uh-huh.
- Is he all right?

451
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,200
Not a scratch.
The fucking luck on this guy.

452
00:27:26,235 --> 00:27:27,900
Yeah.

453
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,200
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, Dover.

454
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,700
Right, she's got an aunt she's close
to out there who's been sick.

455
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,200
She's friends
with Tony's aunt.

456
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,400
All right, somebody
take me to get my car.

457
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,100
I better
get over there.

458
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,100
Fabio, put it up!

459
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,600
Thought I'd die in there
without a cigarette.

460
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,050
What, so you're
just not gonna talk?

461
00:28:00,085 --> 00:28:02,500
I almost got killed,
Christopher.

462
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:04,465
I'm just curious.

463
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,100
What the fuck were you doing
in the middle of the night

464
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,500
in the middle of nowhere
in a car with my uncle?

465
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:13,100
He was driving me home.

466
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,465
- Fucking Dover?
- We were talking.

467
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,965
W- we were going
to get something to eat.

468
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I get off of work,
I don't want to go right home.

469
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:22,665
You weren't
even there.

470
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,800
No, I was
in a fucking Ride-A-Rent

471
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,500
busting my ass with a bunch
of rednecks making a living,

472
00:28:27,535 --> 00:28:29,665
to buy you
alcohol and coke

473
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,500
and all the other shit
you shovel into your mouth!

474
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,165
2:00 in the fucking morning?!

475
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Don't fucking lie to me!
I can't stand it!

476
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:42,265
Nothing was going on,
Christopher!

477
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,900
- I should've made you walk home!
- I swear to God.

478
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:48,900
You know how this looks?
Don't talk to me!

479
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,900
Shut your mouth!

480
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,765
You wanted
to see me?

481
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,765
- Is Adriana okay?
- She's fine.

482
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,900
People who don't clean up
after their pets...

483
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,600
Pop this in that basket
for me, will you?

484
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,865
It's blind luck,
that accident.

485
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,100
Cop told me he thought
he was coming up

486
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:37,500
on a fatality
when he saw the car.

487
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,500
I would be thinking
the same thing if I were you,

488
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,065
but it's not true.

489
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,400
I don't know what
you're talking about.

490
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,400
Her car was
in the shop,

491
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,200
I was driving her
home from work,

492
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:51,765
that's all.

493
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,400
We were looking
to get a burger.

494
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,700
In Dover.

495
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,265
What difference
does it make?

496
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,950
You don't seem to give
a shit she almost died.

497
00:29:58,985 --> 00:30:01,600
She could've been paralyzed
or scarred up,

498
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:04,100
and you got a puss on?

499
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,000
What were you doing out there
alone in a car with my fiancee?

500
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,465
We were talking about you,
you selfish prick,

501
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,800
and how you're the best thing
that ever happened to her.

502
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,100
Oh, you don't think this
fucking devastates me?

503
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,400
Well, frankly, you scored
so far over your head

504
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:20,267
when you got her,
what do you expect?

505
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:22,100
What the fuck are you
talking about?

506
00:30:22,135 --> 00:30:23,800
She's a knockout,

507
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,550
a 10,
and look at you.

508
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:29,165
You're average at best,

509
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,500
so you better reconcile
yourself with that,

510
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,000
or you're gonna be fucking
paranoid your whole life.

511
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh, so this is
my fucking fault now?

512
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,850
Nothing happened,
and I'm not gonna say it again!

513
00:30:38,885 --> 00:30:41,600
And you should've married
that girl two years ago.

514
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,900
Everybody knows you've been
the biggest fucking cooze hound

515
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:46,700
around the past
four or five years.

516
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Your mid-life crisis.

517
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,900
You'd fuck
a catcher's mitt.

518
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,400
On everything
I hold sacred,

519
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:59,265
on my children,

520
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,800
there's nothing going on
between me and Adriana.

521
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,265
Tony walked away
without a scratch,

522
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,000
but Adriana suffered
a severe blow to the head.

523
00:31:21,035 --> 00:31:24,700
Adriana got caught giving
the big guy a blowjob.

524
00:31:24,735 --> 00:31:26,400
And when the paramedics
found them,

525
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,165
she had his cock
still in her mouth.

526
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,465
Now, statistics show that
most single-car fatalities

527
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,500
are the result of guys popping
their load behind the wheel.

528
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:39,500
Apparently, he came
all over the sun visor.

529
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,200
Sanseverino.

530
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,200
Guess who went down
on Tony Soprano.

531
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,165
That's the truth.
It's fact.

532
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,800
If it was my old lady,
the next thing she would suck

533
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,800
- is a tailpipe.
- That pretty little trim

534
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,700
can suck this pipe
anytime she wants.

535
00:31:55,735 --> 00:31:57,500
Like you would
ever have a shot.

536
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,400
Hey, let me
tell you something.

537
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,250
When Christopher was
in rehab,

538
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:02,965
she was calling me
all the time.

539
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,400
- I was this close.
- Then you got a problem,

540
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,600
'cause your braciole
isn't even that long.

541
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,700
What's so funny?

542
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,400
Nothing.

543
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Didn't sound like nothing,
I want to hear the big joke.

544
00:32:19,535 --> 00:32:21,867
Take it easy,
we're just shooting the shit.

545
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:24,200
We were just talking
about my braciole.

546
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,200
- Oh yeah, what about it?
- So, deal you in, huh?

547
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,800
I asked him
a fucking question.

548
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,565
What are you breaking
my balls for?

549
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,300
I want a fucking answer.
What's so fucking hilarious,

550
00:32:35,335 --> 00:32:37,500
- you fucking parade float?
- Oh!

551
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:39,500
I'm a fucking
captain now.

552
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,300
You don't talk
to me like that!

553
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,850
- Oh, come on, guys.
- Don't put your hands on me!

554
00:32:43,885 --> 00:32:46,300
- Chrissy, for Christ's sake!
- Fuck all of youse!

555
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
- Oh! Whoa, whoa!
- Motherfucker!

556
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,600
- Hold it.
- Easy.

557
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,000
Vinar, Jimmy,
please join me.

558
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,600
So talk to me, guys,
how do we look in these?

559
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,365
Hey, hon.
I already ate.

560
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,500
- There's a casserole in...
- You fucking lying bitch!

561
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,100
Ow! Stop it!
What are you doing?!

562
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,700
You were sucking his cock!
Georgie told me everything!

563
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,700
The surgeon
on the operating table

564
00:33:13,735 --> 00:33:15,600
said you were
moaning Tony's name!

565
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,200
- What are you talking about?!
- You fucking lied to me!

566
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,000
What were you doing
in Dover then?

567
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:22,365
See?
You can't tell me,

568
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,600
'cause I know what you were doing!
Your other dope dealer's there.

569
00:33:25,635 --> 00:33:27,767
I remembered,
go ahead, deny it!

570
00:33:27,802 --> 00:33:29,900
Okay! I was going out
to see Andre,

571
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,500
but I wasn't sucking anybody's cock!
How could you say that?

572
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:35,617
Oh, so you two
were just gonna go toot up

573
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:37,665
a bunch of lines,
go fucking birdwatching?

574
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,400
Oh, you son of a bitch.
I was gonna stay up all night

575
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,365
and clean this
fucking shithole!

576
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Everybody knows about it!
Everybody's talking about it!

577
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,465
- No, please!
- You want me to use you, bitch!

578
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,400
- You're fucking killing me!
- No, I don't, I love you!

579
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Stop it.

580
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,700
- You motherfucker!
- Fucking whore.

581
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,165
Ow, my neck!

582
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,600
Get the fuck out of here!

583
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,300
I never want
to see you again!

584
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,200
I thought you had
an algebra test.

585
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:48,900
- Oh, chill out.
- What did you say?

586
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,800
Well, look, I studied
for 45 minutes straight,

587
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:56,300
don't I get a break?

588
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,500
Hi. What's up?

589
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Oh, AJ,
how's it going?

590
00:35:02,635 --> 00:35:04,465
Hey, Uncle Tony.

591
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,550
Did I come
at a bad time?

592
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:08,600
I need
to talk to you.

593
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,300
AJ, go upstairs, study.

594
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,200
- Well, what about the pizza?
- Now!

595
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,500
Study.

596
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,365
All right,
what's up?

597
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,900
I went to the Belleville Tavern
after work,

598
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,800
and Larry
down there said

599
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,100
our little cousin was
in there all fucked up.

600
00:35:40,135 --> 00:35:42,300
Somebody told him what
was going on in the car.

601
00:35:42,335 --> 00:35:44,165
There was nothing
going on in the car.

602
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,165
No, of course not,
but he thinks there was,

603
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,500
so he started drinking again,
he beat up Adriana

604
00:35:48,535 --> 00:35:50,500
and he threw her out
of the fucking house.

605
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,065
Where's his fucking
self-control, this guy?

606
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,300
Little Paulie's out there
looking for him to rein him in,

607
00:35:56,335 --> 00:35:58,400
but he was saying some
crazy things about you.

608
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,800
Oh, this goddamn kid.

609
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,500
Christopher's not
right in the head, Ton'.

610
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,700
Who the fuck knows
what he's capable of?

611
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,300
Well, he knows
where to find me.

612
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,600
You see him
you tell him that.

613
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,300
I got to use your john.

614
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,100
Get you
a day early, huh?

615
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,650
I'll go to the store
in the morning.

616
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,100
Look, relax.
Go whenever you want.

617
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,065
What the hell
is wrong with him?

618
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,300
What do you want, Tony?
He couldn't bring this in himself?

619
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,765
I can't even come in
and say hello?

620
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,300
What you want is to know if I heard
the disgusting shit they're saying.

621
00:36:49,335 --> 00:36:51,300
At least have the guts
to come out and ask me.

622
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,965
- It isn't true.
- You know what? Fuck you!

623
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,800
Fuck me? Fuck you!
- You got to put your son in hiding

624
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,965
because of your
fucking philandering?

625
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,800
Afraid he'll get caught
in the crossfire? Your own son?

626
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,465
Christopher's upset,
that's all.

627
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,600
He could come over.
He could say some things

628
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,200
- that a kid shouldn't hear.
- Just please leave.

629
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:11,700
I don't even
want to look at you.

630
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
Motherfucker!

631
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,900
Motherfucking gun!

632
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,965
Give me two.

633
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,900
This kid ain't
gonna show up, T.

634
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:23,800
He's probably
in some gutter.

635
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,100
Yeah, hopefully
he's wore himself down.

636
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,000
Where are you,
you fuck!

637
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,800
He's got a gun!

638
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,600
I know you're
up there, motherfucker!

639
00:38:32,635 --> 00:38:34,765
You know what
to do down there!

640
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,500
You're fucking lucky!
You're fucking lucky I ran out of loads!

641
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,465
Shut up,
you little cock,

642
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,900
- or I'll split your fucking wishbone.
- It's all over.

643
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:46,000
Everybody,
enjoy the evening.

644
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,100
Unhappy customer.

645
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,000
Let me the fuck go!

646
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,865
I'll kill all of youse!

647
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,900
I'll fucking kill
all of youse!

648
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,900
You draw down on the boss
of a fucking family?

649
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:31,665
- Huh?!
- You lied to me!

650
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,365
You were scoring coke with her!
She admitted it!

651
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,100
So what?! I can't relieve stress
every once in a while?!

652
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:40,200
I don't got enough
fucking problems?

653
00:39:40,235 --> 00:39:42,217
You sent me
to North Carolina

654
00:39:42,252 --> 00:39:44,165
so you could fuck
my girlfriend.

655
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,200
What kind of fucking animal
you think I am, huh?

656
00:39:48,235 --> 00:39:50,500
The thought never
even entered my head!

657
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,100
You're a man!
You're alone in a car with her...

658
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,000
You fucking pushed me to this.
You pushed me to this!

659
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,700
Way I see it, he must've known
the gun was empty.

660
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:07,817
Look what he pumped
into your car.

661
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:10,376
What are you trying
to say, Paulie?!

662
00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:12,900
What the fuck
you trying to say, huh?!

663
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,665
Either you
tell me right now

664
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,700
that you can take it
into your heart

665
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,900
that I did not
do this shit...

666
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,000
or this is
as far as we go.

667
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,365
- Motherfucker.
- Tony, come on!

668
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,300
- Listen to somebody else for a change.
- Fuck him.

669
00:40:45,335 --> 00:40:48,100
Tony, try it my way.

670
00:40:48,135 --> 00:40:50,700
Listen to me.

671
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,165
Mister... Sorriano,

672
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,300
- what seems to be the matter?
- Soprano.

673
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm fine. It's my friend here
who needs to talk to you.

674
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:23,565
You know where
ER admitting is?

675
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,565
Look, you got someplace
maybe we could talk?

676
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,300
It's 3:00 A.M., and I just finished
a 17-hour rotation.

677
00:41:30,335 --> 00:41:33,900
Any gunshot wounds
or broken kneecaps?

678
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Two minutes.

679
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,200
You're an excellent doctor,
that's why I brought him here.

680
00:41:42,235 --> 00:41:44,000
Come on.

681
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,100
This gentleman here
is the fiance

682
00:41:55,135 --> 00:41:57,517
of the young lady
that I was with.

683
00:41:57,552 --> 00:41:59,865
Now, he's got it
into his head

684
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,800
that there was oral sex going on
at the time of the wreck.

685
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
- Listen, I...
- Hey, hey, hey!

686
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,400
Just a second.

687
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,365
Naturally,
he's very upset,

688
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,900
so I need you
to tell him there wasn't.

689
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,900
He's obviously
feeling the pressure,

690
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,900
he's just gonna
fucking lie.

691
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,700
I'm not in the custom
of lying about anything,

692
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,165
but whether somebody

693
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,450
was getting
something in the car,

694
00:42:28,485 --> 00:42:30,665
how could I possibly
attest to that?

695
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,665
Well, as the attending,
you could explain

696
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,900
- how medically it's not possible.
- Excuse me?

697
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,300
If she was wearing her seatbelt,
then there would have been abrasions

698
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:41,300
to the lateral anterior aspect
of the clavicle, wouldn't there?

699
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,400
Or the right
mid-sternum?

700
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,465
Are you a physician?

701
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,500
No, I'm a pre-board certified
massage therapist.

702
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,600
So did she have any
of those kind of things?

703
00:42:53,635 --> 00:42:55,665
Actually, yes,
on the right clavicle

704
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,700
and the sternum just above
the xiphoid process

705
00:42:58,735 --> 00:43:00,865
which would indicate

706
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,000
an upright position
at the moment of impact.

707
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,700
So what he's saying is
that she was sitting up.

708
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,965
All right.

709
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,500
Thank you, doctor.
Come on.

710
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,700
For the kids,
the Make-A-Wish Foundation,

711
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,600
whatever... here.

712
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,900
Thank you!

713
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,700
What do you
want from me?

714
00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:29,900
I guess
I believe you.

715
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,100
All right.

716
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,300
You threw food at Vito.
That's got to be resolved.

717
00:43:39,335 --> 00:43:41,400
He was fucking laughing,
which was wrong.

718
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,200
But at this point now,
it don't make no difference.

719
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,300
Even if it wasn't true,
it's what people think.

720
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,100
They know you were out there
scoring coke with her.

721
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:01,100
What do you care
what people think?

722
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,965
You know the truth.

723
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I got to live
in the world.

724
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,400
And now I look
like Joe Jerkoff.

725
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,800
No, no, no, no.

726
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,400
You know what?

727
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,900
I might as well
have fucked her.

728
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,600
Thanks.

729
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,700
Hello?

730
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,065
I rang the doorbell
six times.

731
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,500
- Nobody answered.
- What are you doing here?

732
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,500
I want to talk to you.

733
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,465
If you came to pick
him up, he's not going.

734
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,000
Oh, so you believe all that
shit they're saying, huh?

735
00:44:54,035 --> 00:44:57,100
Am I that horrible?
Really?

736
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,900
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

737
00:44:58,935 --> 00:45:00,500
I don't know
what you did.

738
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,200
What's gonna happen when
your children hear about this?

739
00:45:03,235 --> 00:45:05,500
- Meadow already suspects you.
- Suspects what?

740
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,600
She saw you at the club.
She said she thought you were coked out.

741
00:45:08,635 --> 00:45:10,700
What are you talking about?
I don't do drugs.

742
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,800
She knows about the accident.
What do you think she's gonna think?

743
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,365
And with Anthony
at that age?

744
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,400
Oh, come on, the kids!
The kids... It's about you!

745
00:45:18,435 --> 00:45:19,965
Fine, so it's
all about me!

746
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,500
What, do I mean
nothing to you?!

747
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,300
That I got to live with this
swirling around me?

748
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,600
Forget about what they're saying,
I'm asking you.

749
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,200
You think I'd have
sexual relations with her?

750
00:45:31,235 --> 00:45:33,700
Adriana, who's gonna be
a member of this family?!

751
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,565
Now I want you
to answer me truthfully.

752
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,600
Look, I know I haven't
been a fucking saint, all right?

753
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:47,117
And you got plenty of issues
of your own on that subject.

754
00:45:47,152 --> 00:45:50,600
But you haven't exactly
been a fucking saint yourself.

755
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,400
No, no, no, no, no,
come here.

756
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,200
You think I would go near
that girl like that?

757
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,800
Thank you.

758
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,250
Look, I'm asking you
to pull with me

759
00:46:24,285 --> 00:46:26,365
to put a good face
on this thing.

760
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,000
For the sake of the kids
and this family.

761
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,800
I got to bail
you out?

762
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,700
It's never-ending,
your bullshit.

763
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,200
Use a fucking
crosswalk!

764
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,600
Jesus Christ.

765
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,100
Don't get
all excited.

766
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,465
Most of it's
from the accident.

767
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,400
- You okay?
- What do you fucking think?

768
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,100
Kicked out
of my house,

769
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,565
I may have ulcerated colitis
and you call me up.

770
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,500
We'd like your permission to put
a listening device in your business.

771
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:31,300
This relationship with Tony
could net us a lot of chatter.

772
00:47:31,335 --> 00:47:33,100
Don't forget,
it's him we're after.

773
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,700
There is
no relationship!

774
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,700
The faster we get Tony
and put him away,

775
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,465
the sooner you can
get on with your life.

776
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,900
We can get a court order
to install a device anyway,

777
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,500
- but this will make our lives simpler.
- Fuck you.

778
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,400
I do enough
for you people.

779
00:47:48,435 --> 00:47:50,200
You're not
bugging my club.

780
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,865
Adriana...

781
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:56,300
it's a syndrome,
protecting abusers.

782
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
If it would've been Christopher
alone in a car with a woman,

783
00:48:01,035 --> 00:48:03,500
I would've killed him.

784
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,100
Arthur's sending something
over with his compliments.

785
00:48:39,135 --> 00:48:41,000
Thank you.

786
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,000
Thank you.

787
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,400
Enjoy.

788
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,400
- Nice to see you, Ton'.
- Oh, thank you.

789
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,000
- Gravy's good tonight.
- Mm-hmm.

790
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,665
Nice to see you.

791
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,700
I hope you have
a pleasant evening.

792
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,400
Ladies.
