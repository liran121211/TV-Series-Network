1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,800
# You woke up
this morning #

2
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:15,265
# Got yourself a gun #

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,400
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,800
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,100
# You've got
to burn to shine #

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,100
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,900
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,800
# When you
woke up this morning #

9
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:36,600
# And all that love
had gone #

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,800
# Your papa never
told you about #

11
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:42,265
# Right and wrong #

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,600
# But you're...
you're lookin' good, baby #

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,000
# I believe that
you're feelin' fine #

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,700
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

15
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:52,165
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,465
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,100
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

18
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:01,100
# Woke up this morning #

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,850
# You say you woke up
this morning #

20
00:01:05,885 --> 00:01:08,565
# The world
turned upside down #

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,800
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

22
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:14,100
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,500
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,300
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

25
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:22,000
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

26
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,000
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,000
# Woke up
this morning #

28
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,200
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

29
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,200
- # Woke up this morning #
- # Got yourself a gun #

30
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,800
- # Uh-huh #
- # Got yourself a gun. #

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,800
Ah, that's so funny!
Ha ha.

32
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,500
No, it isn't! You just
poked me in the eye!

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,800
Well, you poked me first.

34
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:22,000
I can't find
the thing.

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,200
Here.

36
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,100
I don't know what the fuck
happened to the DeWalt.

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,465
Everything disappears
around here.

38
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,600
Especially now that I'm outta the house.
She lets everything go.

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,500
Stop, stop, Uncle Tony!
It's freezing cold!

40
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:44,700
Uncle Tony,
knock it off!

41
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,500
She wants to talk
to me about somethin'.

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,800
Thanks for havin' us
up here, Ton'.

43
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,700
Don't put pine cones in the filter!
The hell's the matter with you?

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,900
- Yo, Dad, he's hitting me!
- Hey, what did I say?

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,900
They will probably go
through their entire lives

46
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:14,100
not knowing that
their father's sperm

47
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,500
was smuggled out of jail
to get Nancy pregnant.

48
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
It was the least
I could do.

49
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,100
I just remembered what
happened to the power drill.

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,900
Pardon me?

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,400
I loaned it to your cousin Brian.
And he never gave it...

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,600
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

53
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:36,300
One of your attacks?

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,400
No, it...
I think it's just indigestion.

55
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:45,900
It's goin' away.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,500
- I had an attack... full blown.
- What did your therapist say?

57
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
- I don't see her no more.
- Why not?

58
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,700
You think you're the only
one that has to cut back

59
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,200
on shit they need
'cause of the separation?

60
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,800
Now, what's
on your mind?

61
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,400
Mr. Wegler wants us
to come in and discuss

62
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:13,300
AJ's lousy
academic performance.

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,200
Is this the same Wegler?

64
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,100
Last year... the riccion
with the Billy Budds?

65
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:20,065
AJ got him as
a college advisor.

66
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,500
I told this kid to start
crackin' the books.

67
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:24,865
Was he supposed
to do that after he got back

68
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,350
from the Nets game
you took him to on a school night?

69
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:29,765
It's gotta be hard for him,
this situation with us.

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,700
- Why don't you cut him some slack?
- That's your department.

71
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
I get to be the prison warden
over here while you indulge him

72
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,000
- with the iPod, the drums...
- Again with the drums!

73
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,400
Encourage extracurricular
activity, you said.

74
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,100
Brand new drums, just like that?
Don't even look in the classifieds.

75
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:47,065
Just tell me when
the school meetin' is

76
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,800
'cause I don't have to listen
to this shit anymore.

77
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
That's why we're separated!

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,200
Are you kidding me, Tony?
That is not why!

79
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:58,400
Jase?
Were you knocking?

80
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,400
Hi, Lorraine.
I'm Billy.

81
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:06,300
What the fuck? Jason!

82
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:09,600
Ow, no!
Jason!

83
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,100
Jason!

84
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,500
Oh, no!

85
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,700
You were warned, Lorraine.
The money goes up to John.

86
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,800
Fuck!

87
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,000
Lorraine Calluzzo
and the kid Jason.

88
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:49,600
Fuckin'
Philly Leotardo!

89
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,100
She told me he warned her
about givin' us points of her take.

90
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Phil's a pimple.
It's goddamn Johnny Sack.

91
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,200
It's his message to the other captains,
that fuckin' animal.

92
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:05,800
- Take it easy.
- Fuck that.

93
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,500
Rusty!
The car's here.

94
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,365
I'm telling you,
Carmine,

95
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,665
we go all out, we'll steamroll
right over John.

96
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,800
And I predict the guys on the street
in Brooklyn and Queens,

97
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:27,400
they'll welcome us as fuckin' heroes.
It'll be easy.

98
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,600
It's a fuckin' declaration of war
by Johnny, if ya ask me.

99
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,165
- Hey!
- Ho.

100
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,265
There he is.
Let me kiss the ring.

101
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,200
How about the one
in the center of my ass?

102
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,400
- Hey.
- Feech, good to see ya, baby.

103
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:49,265
Good to see you.
Hello there, kid.

104
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,065
- Hey, how are ya, boys?
- How are ya, Feech?

105
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,900
Just, uh... talkin' about that mess
over in New York.

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sounds to me
like your friend John

107
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:00,000
wants to force
Little Carmine's hand.

108
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,165
In my day, the top spot
would've gone to Little Carmine,

109
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,600
unless he was actually retarded
or crippled or something. He's the son.

110
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,200
Come on, when was that?

111
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,500
Yeah?

112
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,200
- Vodka rocks.
- Thank you, dear.

113
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:18,500
Anybody else?

114
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,750
If we need anything else,
one of the kids'll come out.

115
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:24,900
Ton', you didn't have any lunch.
You want a sandwich?

116
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:26,600
No, I'm all right.
Thanks.

117
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
Adriana,
hold on a second.

118
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:33,600
Tommy Pinto's goomah,

119
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,100
when I was comin' up she had
the long legs, up to here, like that.

120
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,300
Famous beauty,
smart as a whip.

121
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,400
My compliments.

122
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,400
Thank you, baby.

123
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,100
You drove
Tommy Pinto?

124
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,400
I was at the Clam Broth House
the night

125
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,600
he beat that longshoreman
to death over a corner table.

126
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,965
- No shit.
- Here we go... Memory Lane.

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,465
It's important these young guys
know the history.

128
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,300
Tell 'em about the time Tony and Jackie
Aprile knocked over your card game.

129
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,565
Oh, that he doesn't
like to talk about.

130
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,500
I heard this.
This is a great fuckin' story.

131
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:10,800
He should be
dead by now.

132
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,500
They bust in,
couple of fuckin' punks.

133
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,365
Guns out. Bad guys.

134
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,950
This one is
fuckin' scared!

135
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:21,500
First of all,
it was my game.

136
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,000
Feech has forgiven,
even if he hasn't forgotten.

137
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,200
But it's a great yarn,
right, Feech?

138
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,500
Yeah.

139
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,750
Actually, it brings me
to my business.

140
00:08:34,785 --> 00:08:37,600
Fellas, you wanna
give us a minute here?

141
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,100
Yeah.

142
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,465
So, what's up?

143
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,400
I came to ask
for my game back.

144
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:56,300
It's my uncle's game
now, Feech.

145
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,100
Yeah right,
your uncle's.

146
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,350
You'll still keep
a lion's share of the rake.

147
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:03,500
I'm in a way just askin'
if I can run it for ya.

148
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,165
- Why would I need that?
- 11 years I ran it...

149
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,200
no fights, no raids. Not to mention
that maybe I got it comin',

150
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,400
considering how it could've gone for you
after you took the game down

151
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,965
if I had been
a prick about it.

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,400
Or if his old man didn't
have so many friends.

153
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,900
I'll give you 20%, but you gotta rent
the house from me.

154
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:29,500
I could throw some
high rollers your way...

155
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,100
friends of mine.

156
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,965
All right.

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,700
Let me get outta here before I keep
talkin' and fuck this up. Jesus.

158
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:41,200
Thank you,
Don Antonio.

159
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,400
He's a strunz.

160
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,465
He's a busybody,
that's all.

161
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,500
He's an egomaniac, Ton',
always was, always will be.

162
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,065
Nothing's ever good enough...
praise, money.

163
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Comes into this fuckin' office,
starts orderin' people around.

164
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,265
He's old.

165
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,000
How do ya think
that feels?

166
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,165
Can I go to the Mudvayne
concert or not?

167
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,600
I've been trying to think of a reason
to let you stay overnight in New York,

168
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:25,667
but I'm afraid
it's not gonna happen.

169
00:10:25,702 --> 00:10:27,665
Todd's mother already
made arrangements.

170
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,600
- Said it's better than driving home.
- She's not your mother.

171
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:33,800
Yeah, I know.
Believe me.

172
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:36,300
Isn't life unfair?

173
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,265
So we're at
the Peppermint Lounge,

174
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,100
when in walks these two
stewardesses from Braniff.

175
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,300
Everybody's in?
Aces high. Your action, Mr. Taylor.

176
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,865
- 200.
- Hesh?

177
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,965
They're sittin' at the bar.
We send 'em a bottle of Dom.

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,700
Next thing ya know, we're in the hotel
room... me, Frankie and the two broads.

179
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,500
- I see ya, raise ya three.
- You mother...

180
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
But this one, this little pothead
from Texas, she fucked me dry.

181
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,500
But she still wanted more!
She's fuckin' nuts.

182
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,400
I'm wearin'
these pointy featherweights

183
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,200
and I stick the toe in
and I'm fuckin' her with it.

184
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,065
I don't know where
this story's heading

185
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,000
but we should all be grateful
he wasn't wearing white bucks.

186
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,500
The maid walks in.
She says, "What's goin' on?"

187
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:16,400
And I say...

188
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,200
Ante up, boys.

189
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,150
Hello, girls!

190
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:22,092
- Ho!
- Hey!

191
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:23,965
Hi, Ton'.

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
- Sir Lawrence from the Meadowlands.
- Your Highness, how are you?

193
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,400
Tony, let me introduce
Bernie Brillstein.

194
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:31,800
Did you get my list of toys?

195
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,400
- What's up?
- Hey, Ton'.

196
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,665
Oh, my cousin!
Kinda high stakes for you, no?

197
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,800
Feech fronted my action.
And thank you for not humiliating me.

198
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,300
Isn't there somethin' in your parole

199
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,800
about hangin' out
with degenerates like this?

200
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:49,200
- Oh!
- Come on, he gets away with anything.

201
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,800
Last time his parole officer
made the unannounced visit,

202
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:53,700
he gave him a massage.

203
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So how's Lady Luck
treatin' you, huh?

204
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,500
Jesus-fuckin'- Christ.
How many times this guy gotta say hello?

205
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:07,500
What, did I interrupt one
of your impermeable stories?

206
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,050
Go ahead.

207
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:12,865
So...

208
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,765
we had these girls
in the hotel room.

209
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,100
Long story short,
I got my shoe in her snatch...

210
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,600
and it falls off and she keels over.
Che puzz'.

211
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Fuck it.
This hand's from thalidomide.

212
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,900
Three ladies,
gentlemen.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
- Ah!
- Stake it.

214
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,600
- Take it.
- The rich get richer.

215
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,500
So Doc, how's the, uh,
plans for the wedding?

216
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:43,117
Please. It's not a wedding
planner anymore.

217
00:12:43,152 --> 00:12:45,700
It's an "environment
and event coordinator. "

218
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:48,600
What the hell.
She's my only daughter.

219
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,550
She and Iris have their hearts set
on makin' the Vows column

220
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:54,400
of the Sunday "New York Times"...
featured couple of the week.

221
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:56,465
Our publicist
is lookin' for a hook.

222
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,600
Turns out that Gillian's law degree
from Harvard means bupkis.

223
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:01,300
Everybody's got
that or better.

224
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,700
If it was a black couple
or a gay couple they'd be in.

225
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,100
My wife calls "The Times" wedding
section the ladies' sports page.

226
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,800
So Ira, who's
the lucky guy?

227
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,265
Jeremy Silverman, puppeteer,
Children's Television Workshop.

228
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,100
Father's Asa Silverman, head
of commercial paper at Goldman Sachs.

229
00:13:18,135 --> 00:13:20,700
- Upper Eastside.
- I didn't get my invitation.

230
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
Fuck you.

231
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,900
You told me to be sure

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,800
to let you know
when it was a quarter of.

233
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:44,365
- Thank you, Mary.
- Okay.

234
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
So with Wesleyan
as your fallback,

235
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,265
I think we're in
pretty good shape.

236
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,600
Straight "A"s at Middlebury's Language
Camp, can't sneeze at that.

237
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:54,300
Your blues folkloric studies
in Mississippi last summer

238
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,850
have an almost community-service
spin to them.

239
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:59,300
I wish he had the minority
thing going for him.

240
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,000
If we can nudge Lem's verbals
past 760 on the next round,

241
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:03,900
he can basically
write his own ticket.

242
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,700
I'm stoked.

243
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,200
Appreciate
your help.

244
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Folks?

245
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,600
So let me guess... he called
the English teacher "Daddy-o. "

246
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,500
Oh.

247
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,365
The thing is...

248
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,500
we are rapidly
approaching crisis mode here

249
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,500
with these grades,
and time is of the essence.

250
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,400
Could I ask
a question?

251
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,300
I handed in my final list of colleges.
Did you get that?

252
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,300
Yes, we talked
about this.

253
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,165
So, Ramapo
and Trenton State.

254
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,365
And our reach schools,
University of Arizona and Arizona State.

255
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,800
I'll take him out there after I drive
him around to the ones in New Jersey.

256
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:50,800
If either of the Arizona's is what
he's got his heart set on,

257
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:52,900
he's not gonna get in
with these grades.

258
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,100
I know about football, Anthony.
That's our ace in the hole.

259
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:59,117
He says he's tryin'
his best.

260
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:02,065
S.A.T. -wise,
505 and 430...

261
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,700
I think we can edge up the math
into the fives in the next round,

262
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:07,700
providing Anthony
can bear down and focus.

263
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,465
He's had trouble
with that before.

264
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,765
Remember, Carm, when they
thought he had A.D.D.?

265
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,450
- You didn't tell me that.
- Head on back to class. Let us talk.

266
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:19,100
But if I'm learning-disabled,
I get unlimited time on my S.A.T.s.

267
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:22,300
- Is that true?
- Let's talk about that later.

268
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,565
So you had time to talk

269
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,200
directly to Dr. Rapke about
last week's testing results.

270
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:40,900
Yes. She said Anthony

271
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,600
has good interpersonal skills.

272
00:15:43,635 --> 00:15:46,165
She said his affect was...

273
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,200
now, where is this...
"constricted," she called it.

274
00:15:49,235 --> 00:15:51,400
But that was normal
for a teenager and...

275
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,000
all in all he seemed to be
handling the split well.

276
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,300
This is not to say I don't get a ration
of shit in every conversation.

277
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,400
Pardon my French.

278
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,000
Well, still, uh...

279
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,765
there is this thing
with his grades.

280
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,900
Do you think it would be
of benefit to him

281
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,600
to see a psychologist
on a regular basis?

282
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,000
You don't approve
of therapy, Mr. Soprano.

283
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,600
People use it
as a crutch.

284
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,200
And I always wonder
what happened to Gary Cooper,

285
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:22,165
the strong silent type?

286
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,100
Well, Gary Cooper wasn't
a 16-year-old boy.

287
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,300
He was at one time.

288
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,300
And I'm gonna have to agree
with my husband here, Mr. Wegler.

289
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,000
We sent our
daughter to a...

290
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,600
an adolescent developmentalist
and it was a disaster.

291
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,900
I know my son, he's lazy. We're gonna
get him a different S.A.T. tutor,

292
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm gonna stay on him and he's gonna
work harder. And that's that.

293
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,700
- I might be learning-disabled.
- Didn't he tell you to go to class?

294
00:16:47,735 --> 00:16:50,765
What's going on, Mary?

295
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,065
Domenica Paolini
and Sasha Caputo,

296
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,600
they were on their way to school
this morning and they hit a tree.

297
00:16:57,635 --> 00:17:00,200
Nica's dead.
Sasha's in a coma.

298
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,165
What's that?

299
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
It was here
when I got here.

300
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,700
Okay, if a million zeroes
can be written

301
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:26,000
on the front and back
of a sheet of paper,

302
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,700
how many sheets of paper do you need
for a googol of zeroes?

303
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,665
Whoa!

304
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,665
Oh man, oh baby,
an Xterra SE.

305
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,700
It's loaded.
3.3- liter supercharged.

306
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,100
- What, this is mine?
- Yeah.

307
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,100
- You are unbelievable.
- The sticker's still on it.

308
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:00,165
He doesn't have
enough distractions?

309
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,500
After what happened
to those kids at his school?

310
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:04,100
It's got sensors
in the seatbelts.

311
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,800
It's part of Nissan's
triple safety philosophy.

312
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,100
- Nice ride.
- Are you leaving?

313
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,065
Hour's up.

314
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,300
You're not getting in?

315
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,065
This is so deck.
What is this, Bose?

316
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,800
Yeah, six CD changer.
It's got Surround Sound.

317
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:26,365
I feel safer already.

318
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,100
Carmela,
this car is a tank.

319
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,865
What's the matter?

320
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,165
SUVs eat up
more of the ozone.

321
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,300
So you wanna be the sucker
in a regular car that gets decapitated?

322
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:41,500
- I'm gonna catch shit at school.
- So what do you wanna do?

323
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,200
Screw it.
Can we take it out?

324
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,465
Yeah, we can take it out.
Once.

325
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,900
Then this baby sits in the garage
till you pull your grades up to a "C."

326
00:18:51,935 --> 00:18:53,900
- What?
- You heard your father.

327
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,800
I was talking to him,
not you.

328
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,900
I gotta put dinner on.
Tony, I have bills for you.

329
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,465
You better be nice
to your mother.

330
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,400
She's got the keys
till your grades are up.

331
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:14,900
I'll be right back.

332
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,865
The car was
a motivational tool.

333
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,065
The carrot and the stick,
you gotta do both!

334
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,400
I could strangle him sometimes.
He can be so hateful.

335
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:27,600
Well, the smart mouth
is not good.

336
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,665
That's minor,
believe me.

337
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,100
God, what happened to him?
He was always the sweet one.

338
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,650
He had the concept of sharing before
any of the other toddlers.

339
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:40,100
Meadow was always sharper, but I
remember the same thing with her.

340
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:42,600
It's like watching
an angel fall.

341
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,300
What, are you crying?

342
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,800
Here's the tutor in writing
like you had to have.

343
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,265
I had to call
RotoRooter.

344
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,565
This is a cheap sound system
for the media room.

345
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,500
- Why should I pay for that?
- Because you took the last one.

346
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:07,400
Oh, your little movie connoisseur
friends are still meeting?

347
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:10,000
- At least I have friends.
- What the fuck's that mean?

348
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:11,900
You just have
a bunch of flunkies.

349
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:13,165
What do you
know about it?

350
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,800
They compliment you
on your new shoes.

351
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,100
They tell you that
you're not going bald.

352
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,600
You think
they really care?

353
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,665
You're the boss,
they're scared of you.

354
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,200
They have to kiss your ass,
laugh at your stupid jokes.

355
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,200
What about Artie then?
You're turning into a frigging cynic.

356
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:30,165
- Whatever.
- What do I give a shit?

357
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,800
I'm running a fucking business
not a popularity contest.

358
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,000
"I've been thinking,

359
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,900
and I apologize for my use
of fowl language"...

360
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:40,900
fowl with a "W"...

361
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,100
"in regards to yourself.

362
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,500
You said some very
hurtful things to me

363
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:48,065
in regards to myself.

364
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,200
But it is still no excuse to use
the vile word that I used,

365
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:55,300
of which
I am sure you know...

366
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,265
that I'm talking about. "

367
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,000
- "Cunt," right?
- Yes, Elliot.

368
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
"You don't wish us
to be social friends

369
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:08,765
and so that is that.

370
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,000
I still have
great rigard for you,

371
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,600
even though you said
some horrible things.

372
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:17,500
P.S. I'm doing fine,
Anthony. "

373
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,400
It came with a bathrobe

374
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,800
and a basketful of
Dr. Hauschka bath products.

375
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:26,900
Ablution.

376
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,200
The desire to cleanse
himself of the deed.

377
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Notice he still
fundamentally blames me.

378
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,100
- Hello?
- Mrs. Soprano? Robert Wegler.

379
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:45,665
Oh, hi, hello,
how are you?

380
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,865
Uh... after our meeting
the other day,

381
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,300
I had some ideas about
some further strategies for Anthony.

382
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:53,400
I thought maybe
we could meet,

383
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,000
have lunch, cup of coffee.
I could share them with you.

384
00:21:57,035 --> 00:21:59,500
- Next week perhaps?
- Really?

385
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,500
Uh... well yeah, I guess
that would be okay.

386
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,600
"Happy Birthday"
by the Beatles.

387
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,165
You know, I heard it
the other day in the car.

388
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,200
They have such a good drum solo
in the middle there.

389
00:22:22,235 --> 00:22:26,100
"Drum solo"?
That's the basic four-four.

390
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,600
You know Ringo was not their original
drummer. That was Pete Best.

391
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:34,900
And they fired him.

392
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,100
He put out his own album...
"Best of the Beatles. "

393
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,100
Sad.

394
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,800
So, is this what they call
common ground?

395
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,100
Just trying to have
a civilized conversation.

396
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,000
Can I go to my room?
I'm full.

397
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,165
Am I so horrible?

398
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,965
You are not horrible.
Get over yourself.

399
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,400
"Over myself"?
What is that supposed to mean?

400
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,800
Just go,
do me a big favor.

401
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,400
If you're gonna be a martyr,
obviously I'll sit here.

402
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:12,000
No, go.
Put your plate in the sink.

403
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,300
200.

404
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,365
Two to go.

405
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,665
- See, and raise four.
- Call.

406
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,600
Tony, you liking the Escalade?
I can't keep them on the lot.

407
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,165
I love it...

408
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,500
after I pulled out that
global positioning shit.

409
00:23:42,535 --> 00:23:43,600
Oh, right.

410
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,300
Always got his eye
on the big picture.

411
00:23:47,335 --> 00:23:49,065
Up to you.

412
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,000
I think you got that ace
and I'm not paying you for it.

413
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,800
- Aces over.
- Three threes, my man.

414
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,900
Paulie wins.
Cards, please.

415
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,400
You, fuck you.

416
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,150
They used to be a great
tax loophole, those SUVs.

417
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:06,342
Told all my clients,
write it off on your business.

418
00:24:06,377 --> 00:24:09,500
Accountant dies, goes to heaven
same time as the Pope.

419
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,200
St. Peter says
"Come on in!"

420
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,265
Then he shows the Pope
to this shithouse.

421
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,300
That's where he's gonna live,
and he gives him a crust of bread.

422
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,050
Then he shows the C.P.A.
where he's gonna live.

423
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:21,665
It's a fuckin' mansion...
servants, broads.

424
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,000
Pope says "He gets a mansion
and I get a hovel?"

425
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:28,167
St. Peter says
"Your Holiness,

426
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:30,251
we got hundreds
of popes up here.

427
00:24:30,286 --> 00:24:32,300
This is the first
Jewish accountant!"

428
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I used to be able
to write off condoms.

429
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,900
What do you get when you cross
an accountant with a giant jet airplane?

430
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
A Boring 747.

431
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,700
All right, all right,
bet two.

432
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,000
Algebra, huh?

433
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,900
Listen,

434
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,865
I have been doing
some thinking.

435
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,700
I've decided to let you
stay in the city after the concert.

436
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,300
How come?

437
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,300
On one condition, though...
no Hudson Suites.

438
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,150
I talked to Mead, she said that you
can sleep over at her apartment.

439
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:43,900
I will give you cab fare. When the
concert's over, go straight up there.

440
00:25:43,935 --> 00:25:46,700
Sunday morning,
I want you home 10:30 sharp.

441
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Thanks.

442
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
Don't stay up too late.

443
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,500
Come on! Go, go, go!
Hurry!

444
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,700
So, you guys like your job?

445
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,100
Beemer, space 43.

446
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,450
# Siman tov umazel tov,
umazel tov v'siman tov #

447
00:26:21,485 --> 00:26:24,392
# Siman tov umazel tov, umazel tov
v'siman tov #

448
00:26:24,427 --> 00:26:27,300
# Siman tov umazel tov,

00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,217
# Y'hei lanu... #

450
00:26:30,252 --> 00:26:33,065
Asa, come on!

451
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,950
#... Ul'chol yisra-el #

452
00:26:35,985 --> 00:26:38,800

# Y'hei lanu
y'hei lanu... #

459
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,300
Can I have your attention?

460
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,400
Apparently there's
been an armed robbery.

461
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:09,800
Some automobiles
were taken.

462
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,765
They left all
the American cars!

463
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,850
- Oh my God.
- I think his skull is broken.

464
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,900
- Oh my God!
- I'm a doctor, let me in there.

465
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:20,900
Brooke,
our car is gone.

466
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,800
Now who's a genius
for keeping his Regal?

467
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:25,900
Asa, they got the SL.

468
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,265
That was a fucking
SL55 convertible.

469
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,700
You know how long my brother
was on the waiting list for that thing?

470
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,400
A motherfucking year.

471
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
You want to go
back to that?

472
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,800
Yes, I wanna go back
to that!

473
00:27:45,835 --> 00:27:47,800
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

474
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,100
- How was Mudvayne?
- They rocked.

475
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,800
Look, I... I don't think I'll be able
to make it up there.

476
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,265
What are you talking about?
You know mom's gonna call here.

477
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,300
I'm a total dick if I leave here.
Just tell mom I'm on my way up.

478
00:27:59,335 --> 00:28:01,265
She's just
gonna call back.

479
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,400
Come on, when do I ever
ask you for anything?

480
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:05,565
All right,
you better stay there.

481
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,400
Be home on time tomorrow.
I don't want any shit from mom.

482
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,500
Frida, why do you and Diego
have separate houses?

483
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,500
Because we are
two different people,

484
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:17,000
but our love
makes us into one.

485
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
- Hello?
- Mead, hi.

486
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,000
Is your brother there?
He's not answering his cell.

487
00:28:52,035 --> 00:28:54,965
- I know, he's asleep.
- What?

488
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,500
I probably shouldn't be telling you
this, but he was pretty zapped.

489
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,500
I knew it.
Is he all right?

490
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,265
Mom, he's fine.

491
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,000
Just wait until you
have children.

492
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,500
Not me,
I'm never having kids.

493
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,865
So, how are
things going?

494
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
We're in the middle
of a movie, Mom.

495
00:29:12,935 --> 00:29:15,600
Oh, I'm sorry.
Good night.

496
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,600
Good night.

497
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,965
Come on, light
the fucker up.

498
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,500
- Give me the lighter.
- It's on the table.

499
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,265
All right,
go, go, go, go, go!

500
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,200
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

501
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,400
Go! Hold it!
Hold it!

502
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,665
Open up, it's me.

503
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,300
Come on, open
the fucking door!

504
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,400
Where's the patient?

505
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,700
I got a new easel, new oils,
I'm ready to go.

506
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,200
Salut.

507
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,265
Oh, the wedding? Wh... what, do you
got everybody outside?

508
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,500
- Ushers and everybody? Bring 'em in...
- It's a fucking disaster.

509
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,800
- What?
- Somebody hit us.

510
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,965
They stole all
the fucking cars.

511
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,600
I had to sedate my own
little girl at her wedding.

512
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:36,300
Jesus.

513
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,000
Yeah, they had one of those... what do
you call it, those car carrier things?

514
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:42,165
And it was a very well
coordinated operation.

515
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,900
The cops are on it, but how much faith
have I got in that?

516
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:47,567
You gotta help me
before they're chopped!

517
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:50,165
I'm not really
in that business, Ira.

518
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,465
Asa's brother's Benz was taken.
This special thing.

519
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,300
I'm fucking gernischt in Asa's eyes now.
Can't you do anything?

520
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,800
- I mean, make some calls?
- All that shit's insured.

521
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,065
He's obsessed with that car,
this fucking Stew guy.

522
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,500
The asshole paid a $30,000
premium just to place the fucking order.

523
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:08,900
His glasses,
his daybook were in it.

524
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,300
AJ, it's your mother.
Call me.

525
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,100
It's my mother.

526
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,700
I told you I can't put you through.
Room 417 has a block on the line.

527
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,300
I am not waiting.
Who knows what's going on?

528
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,200
God help you if anything happens
like those children in Westchester.

529
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,150
Don't!
No, don't answer it.

530
00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:07,600
My face is stuck
to the rug.

531
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,700
Oh, they fuckin'
crazy-glued you.

532
00:32:12,735 --> 00:32:14,865
Housekeeping!

533
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,800
Oh, fuck, what should we do?
We're asleep!

534
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:21,100
All right, help me.

535
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:23,200
Ow, ow!

536
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,700
- Ow! Dude, take it easy.
- I'm trying.

537
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,050
Ahh ow, fuck.

538
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:35,000
Oh, dude!

539
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,300
Oh, fuck.

540
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
Oh, fuck me.

541
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,365
Hello.

542
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,500
Hi, yeah, it's me.

543
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,000
AJ stayed in the city with his friends
last night and he's not home yet.

544
00:33:02,035 --> 00:33:05,200
- And I can't get in touch with him.
- Take it easy. Slow down.

545
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:07,165
He's probably just
sleeping it off.

546
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,300
No, I called Todd's mother
and Todd came home.

547
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,300
He could be dead by now,
O.D.'d, God knows what else.

548
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:14,565
- God, why did I let him go?
- He's all right.

549
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,000
I'll take care of it.
Give me the number of the hotel.

550
00:33:18,035 --> 00:33:20,165
It's the Hudson Suites
on the Westside.

551
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,700
Tony, just go there. I am... I'm so
worried I'm not even angry anymore.

552
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,200
All right, all right,
I'm on my way.

553
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,565
Anthony?

554
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,700
God damn you! I have been going
crazy trying to reach you.

555
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,500
- Later. I don't feel good.
- What happened to your face?

556
00:33:37,535 --> 00:33:40,217
- Just leave me alone.
- I want to know what happened!

557
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:42,900
You never went to Meadow's
after you gave me your word!

558
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:44,600
- Get off my back.
- You are a liar!

559
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,500
- Fuck you.
- What did you say?!

560
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:49,600
Get back here!
Ow!

561
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,365
Puritan Salvage.

562
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,000
The big guy's looking for a consignment
from a wedding in Ringwood last night.

563
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,865
Nothing came in here.

564
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,400
This Benz, SL55,
he wants it pulled.

565
00:34:11,435 --> 00:34:13,000
I'll make some calls.

566
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,400
- Where is he?
- In his room.

567
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
What happened
to your leg?

568
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,465
He lied to me, Tony,
which means that they both lied.

569
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,800
She's covering for him.
It's what sisters are supposed to do.

570
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,300
Of course, right.

571
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,400
- He cursed at me. Oh my God.
- What did he say?

572
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,900
- He's asleep.
- Not anymore.

573
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:49,400
Oh, hey, Dad.

574
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,600
I was just taking out the trash.
It's garbage day tomorrow.

575
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,400
- What's different about you?
- He has no eyebrows, Tony!

576
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,600
- Who did this?
- We were just screwing around.

577
00:35:01,635 --> 00:35:03,500
- What'd you say to your mother?
- Tony...

578
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,400
What did you say?

579
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,065
I said the "F" word.

580
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,400
You're finished.
You're never gonna drive that car

581
00:35:09,435 --> 00:35:11,665
till you're 45 years old.
I'm selling it tomorrow!

582
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,600
She wouldn't let me talk,
I was trying to tell her what happened.

583
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:17,400
- Oh see, it's my fault.
- All right, let's hear it.

584
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,765
Well, I was gonna go to Meadow's
but there weren't any cabs.

585
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,100
I didn't think you'd want me standing
in the street at 11:30 at night.

586
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,900
- We were right by the hotel.
- Enough of your lying.

587
00:35:28,935 --> 00:35:31,765
- I am not lying!
- Look at your face!

588
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,600
If you've got some kind
of sexual proclivity

589
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,400
with that teacher or whatever,
now is the time to tell us!

590
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,600
What went on up there?
Poppers and weird sex?

591
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:42,465
What? No!

592
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,300
Look, we don't do drugs,
we're not some stupid dopers.

593
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:49,265
I had a few beers,
but it just made me sick.

594
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,900
- How can anybody believe what you say?
- Because I told you!

595
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,800
You never believe me.

596
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,400
- You had a couple beers?
- Yeah.

597
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
- You didn't do any drugs.
- No!

598
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,300
Carmela, look it...

599
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,500
a couple of beers.

600
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,300
Should be grounded, yeah,
but it's not the end of the world.

601
00:36:15,335 --> 00:36:17,700
What?

602
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,965
You know what?

603
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,665
I am sick of your bullshit.
Both of you!

604
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,000
- He can go live with you.
- Don't get dramatic now, all right?

605
00:36:27,035 --> 00:36:28,800
- What? Great, good.
- Shut up!

606
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,100
I have never been
more serious in my life.

607
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,400
Take out the trash,
go outside.

608
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,400
What are we gonna do,
really?

609
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,565
What did I just say?

610
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,200
- No, I mean really, come on.
- Did you think I was joking?

611
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,800
Carmela, this is
normal teenage shit.

612
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:53,265
You remember us?
The C.Y.O. Dance.

613
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,100
We left Artie out in the snow,
he almost lost his fingers.

614
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
And we still laugh
our asses off about it.

615
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,900
No, I don't really blame AJ He's doing
exactly what he's supposed to.

616
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,100
He's testing the limits as much
as he can. I blame myself.

617
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,700
What are you
talking about?

618
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,600
You don't know what it's like to have
your son hate your guts.

619
00:37:09,635 --> 00:37:13,100
- He doesn't hate your guts.
- Oh, thank God he's alive.

620
00:37:13,135 --> 00:37:14,665
It's my fault, Tony.

621
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,465
My pathetic need to compete with you
clouded my judgment

622
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,200
or I never would have let him stay
in New York. I knew he wasn't ready.

623
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,100
I went against
all of my instincts.

624
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,165
His eyebrows'll grow back!
Nothing really happened!

625
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,200
No, you know what happened?
I said fuck it. And you know why?

626
00:37:31,235 --> 00:37:33,900
To get him to love me
as much as he loves you.

627
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:35,765
He loves you,
it's just...

628
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,550
you're his mother,
it's different.

629
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:39,442
I can't be
the villain anymore.

630
00:37:39,477 --> 00:37:41,300
I mean it.
And I can't say fuck it.

631
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,700
Take him. Let him
live with you.

632
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,000
Homina-homina-
homina-homina.

633
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,665
- Ed Norton?
- Ed Norton?

634
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,900
No, I'm terribly
sorry, Mr. Kramden.

635
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,200
No, the correct answer
is Stephen Foster. But thanks so much.

636
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,000
You've been a wonderful contestant
and a swell sport.

637
00:38:01,035 --> 00:38:03,100
Goodbye,
Mr. Kramden.

638
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,800
He's here.

639
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Hey, tarall's,
expiration date 2007.

640
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,900
Put 'em over there.

641
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,500
Have a seat.

642
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,700
Uh-oh.

643
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,265
Sounds serious.

644
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,500
You have anything to do with
that wedding takedown in Ringwood?

645
00:38:30,535 --> 00:38:32,465
Why, is that a problem?

646
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,800
I told you that doctor
was a friend of mine.

647
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,300
I deliberately
used that word.

648
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Are you aware of how many things
a fucking M.D. can do for us?

649
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,400
Sorry, Godfather, he was at the game.
I thought he was just another pigeon.

650
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,000
Who authorized
you to do it?

651
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,900
And don't call me Godfather
with that fucking cute smirk.

652
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,800
I know I was away
for a long time,

653
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,600
but when did that happen, you gotta ask
permission to ply your trade?

654
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,965
Here's your end, be happy.

655
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,300
When were you gonna tell me
about it if I hadn't called you here?

656
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,900
I'm here now!
I'm telling you about it now!

657
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,665
That's the second time
I'm playing catch-up with you.

658
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,650
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- The lawn cutting.

659
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:15,600
Do I have to send you a memo
every time I move my bowels too?

660
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,900
You're so concerned
about my end,

661
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,500
why didn't you put one of those cars
through my shops?

662
00:39:21,535 --> 00:39:23,500
What?

663
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,900
Johnny Sack told me
about this guy in Newburgh.

664
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:28,265
- Johnny Sack?
- Yeah, Johnny Sack.

665
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,000
Anyway, he gave me a better deal
for shipping them whole.

666
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,900
Are you fucking serious?

667
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,765
I don't like the way
I'm being talked to here.

668
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,200
What did I tell you when you came to me,
said you wanted back in?

669
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:41,600
I said as long as you don't
step on anybody's toes.

670
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,500
- In my day...
- That's another thing.

671
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
I don't wanna hear no more
about how it was in your day.

672
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:47,700
You just keep your anecdotes
to local color,

673
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,200
like Dynaflows, or McGuire Sisters,
shit like that.

674
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,000
Otherwise,
shut the fuck up!

675
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,600
Jesus Christ, Feech,
I'm tryin' to ease your transition here

676
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,800
and this is
the thanks I get?

677
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,200
I'm sorry
if I offended you.

678
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,900
You gotta remember, Tony,
I still think of you as a kid.

679
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,200
I'll learn.

680
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,000
Yeah?

681
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,300
Yeah.

682
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,700
That's funny.

683
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,700
Come here.

684
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,700
Aw, shit.
We all right?

685
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,965
Just...

686
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
get the SL55
back, okay?

687
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,665
Maybe I was
too hard on that guy.

688
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,000
Did I learn nothing
from Richie Aprile?

689
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,300
Huh?

690
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,900
- Nip it in the bud.
- Feech?

691
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,300
- He's well liked, T.
- That's another thing.

692
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,900
All right, well, don't be so hard
on yourself though.

693
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,465
- Hey, Olsen and Johnson.
- How you doing?

694
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,000
Stopped by the bakery,
they said you left already.

695
00:42:24,035 --> 00:42:26,665
That's the Canali suit
I promised you.

696
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,400
He said you should try on the jacket,
see how the sleeves are.

697
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,065
How's that?

698
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,500
How's that?
I look better than Sinatra.

699
00:42:35,535 --> 00:42:38,065
- Very nice.
- All right.

700
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,600
Hey, I'm having my wine and peaches.
You want?

701
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,500
No thanks,
we gotta get going.

702
00:42:44,535 --> 00:42:46,265
- I'll try some peaches.
- Good.

703
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,800
Peaches are from fucking New Zealand.
They're great. I'll get you a glass.

704
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,400
No, we should go,
we should go...

705
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,450
- take care of that thing.
- It can't wait?

706
00:42:53,485 --> 00:42:55,400
Where the fuck you going?
Come on, sit down.

707
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,600
No, we gotta do this shit. You don't
wanna know, it's all fucked up.

708
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,600
What?

709
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,900
My imbecile cousin, he was welding
his boat trailer, burns down his garage.

710
00:43:04,935 --> 00:43:07,600
Now we got no place
to park the truck that we got.

711
00:43:07,635 --> 00:43:09,700
What's wrong
with the street?

712
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,900
Georgia peaches,
those are considered the best.

713
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,500
See, he don't want me
to know what's in the truck.

714
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,165
Flat screen TVs.
50-inch plasma Philipses.

715
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,400
Guy's coming down from Montreal,
but he got delayed a couple of days.

716
00:43:26,435 --> 00:43:28,300
I got a garage
right here.

717
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,065
My cousin's mother's got a place,
we can lock it up there.

718
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,100
Park the load here, this way I'm around.
Keep my glims on the stuff.

719
00:43:35,135 --> 00:43:38,200
- How much you gonna want for that?
- Two.

720
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,500
Fuck you, Feech.
It's fucking parking.

721
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,300
You gotta kick in a TV.

722
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I thought I had a plan
for Anthony, but I...

723
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,565
I'm not so sure now.

724
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,000
I don't know if Rutgers'
summer program

725
00:43:56,035 --> 00:43:58,965
accepts boys
without eyebrows.

726
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,465
So you heard about that?
I was a wreck.

727
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,000
I mean look what happened
to those girls just driving to school.

728
00:44:05,035 --> 00:44:07,317
We brought in
grief counselors.

729
00:44:07,352 --> 00:44:09,565
How's Anthony
coping with that?

730
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,700
I have to say
he never mentioned it.

731
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,000
They all handle
tragedy differently.

732
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,000
Actually, he just moved
in with his father.

733
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,500
- I don't know if he said.
- Really?

734
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,100
I don't know what you might
have heard about my husband.

735
00:44:26,135 --> 00:44:28,165
Some.

736
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,400
I mean, he's a good father,
don't get me wrong.

737
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:32,200
Our daughter
is at Columbia.

738
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,900
My friends tell me I'm a snob
with this college business,

739
00:44:34,935 --> 00:44:37,100
but with Anthony
it's something else.

740
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,400
I just know that if he didn't get into
a good enough school to interest him,

741
00:44:43,435 --> 00:44:46,200
and he dropped out,
went to work as a waiter or something,

742
00:44:46,235 --> 00:44:47,965
he wouldn't last
a week.

743
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,300
You know, he would be drawn
right in... you know.

744
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,350
My husband doesn't
want that for him either.

745
00:44:56,385 --> 00:44:59,700
You met him.
My husband can be very magnetic,

746
00:44:59,735 --> 00:45:02,165
you know,
bigger than life.

747
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,800
And I was so young.
It was very exciting.

748
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,165
Anyway, he's over there.

749
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,900
Maybe it'll be good,
you know,

750
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
learning the things
that men need to know.

751
00:45:15,035 --> 00:45:17,100
Well...

752
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,500
Anyway, so what about you?
How long have you been at the school?

753
00:45:20,535 --> 00:45:22,600
Since '86.

754
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,200
I suppose that's what caught
me up too, with Astrid.

755
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,600
Some notion of escaping
the quotidian.

756
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,800
- So you were married.
- For about, uh... five minutes.

757
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:38,800
Chicken Marsala.

758
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,800
- And the honey balsamic chicken.
- Thank you.

759
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,000
- Have you read "Madame Bovary"?
- No.

760
00:45:48,035 --> 00:45:50,465
It's almost
a perfect novel.

761
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,100
Flaubert writes about bourgeois
loneliness and emptiness.

762
00:45:54,135 --> 00:45:57,700
Emma Bovary destroys herself
for some fantasy in her head.

763
00:45:57,735 --> 00:46:00,200
It's great.
It's truly, truly great.

764
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,600
Somehow horrifically funny,
though tragic.

765
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,400
I think you might
enjoy it.

766
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,765
I'll stop by Borders
on my way home.

767
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,500
- Who is it by again?
- Gustave Flaubert.

768
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,165
Yeah?

769
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,300
Supervisor Curran,
parole board.

770
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,000
Site visit.

771
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,400
Where's
Eddie Stimich?

772
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,000
He's out sick.
I just wanna take a look around.

773
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,400
Only thing better about here
than Russia is the food.

774
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,100
Good one.

775
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,800
Eddie examined every fucking
dust bunny in the place just last week.

776
00:46:57,835 --> 00:47:00,300
Is that new?

777
00:47:00,335 --> 00:47:02,217
Uh...

778
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,100
bequest.

779
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,300
Friend of mine,
passed away.

780
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,000
Is that your garage?

781
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,200
Nah, it's where I make the weapons
of mass destruction.

782
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,100
Let's go out
and open it up.

783
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,967
You wanna see
my fucking garage?

784
00:47:29,002 --> 00:47:30,800
You never seen
an oil stain before?

785
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,900
Let's go.

786
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,400
Here's the windup.

787
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,200
And the pitch...

788
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:51,900
- Ah!
- Come on!

789
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,465
Fuck Major League
Baseball.

790
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,300
Ever since the fucking strike.
Let's watch ballet.

791
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,065
Oh, somebody
hotboxed us?

792
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,700
- I saw you close the window.
- What's that?

793
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,200
It's when you close
the windows and fart on purpose.

794
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,800
That's a Dutch oven.

795
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,600
- No, in bed it's a Dutch oven.
- What's a Dutch oven?

796
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,600
You fart in bed with a woman then force
her head under the covers.

797
00:48:12,635 --> 00:48:14,365
That's awesome.

798
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,900
- First you gotta be in bed with one.
- You'd be surprised.

799
00:48:17,935 --> 00:48:19,717
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

800
00:48:19,752 --> 00:48:21,500
Yeah, I would.

801
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,100
Oh my God!
What...

802
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,100
Jesus!

803
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,100
That's enough.
Go upstairs, do your Spanish homework.

804
00:48:32,135 --> 00:48:35,000
- In 15 minutes.
- No, now.

805
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,500
And he goes down looking.
The end of the inning.

806
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,265
Just got the call.

807
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,800
They put him on
a corrections bus this morning.

808
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,165
This was the better move
than taking him out.

809
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,800
- The man was a legend.
- Christopher agrees, by the way.

810
00:49:47,835 --> 00:49:51,000
Well, that's nice
that he agrees.

811
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,200
But I'm not running
a fucking popularity contest.

812
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,400
Mommy!
Look at me!

813
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,900
Anthony!
