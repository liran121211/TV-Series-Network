1
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,800
- You must be hungry.
- You're not gonna cook, are ya?

2
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,200
Just sayin', don't trouble yourself.

3
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,700
How about some Egg Beaters and Tabasco?

4
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,765
That's fine.

5
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Didn't I say
I hate this shoutin'- between-rooms shit?

6
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,900
So, you even gonna look at the brochure?

7
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,300
What is it, Sneakers or somethin'?

8
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,365
Sandals.

9
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,900
It's the jewel of Antigua.

10
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,400
Three sun-filled days on white sand.

11
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,000
- I got AJ on weekends.
- So we'll go on Monday.

12
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:57,500
Get a great rate on an ocean view.

13
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,800
The air is the same temperature as your body
so you don't need to wear clothes.

14
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,800
I gotta watch my skin in the sun.

15
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,900
You know you're getting a divorce
and I see you less than before.

16
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,065
I didn't say no.

17
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,500
I want your undivided attention, for once.

18
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,800
Is it so much to fucking ask
for a little bit of atten...

19
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,100
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.

20
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,600
Oh, my God!

21
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,200
- Oh, my God!
- I got ya. All right, OK.

22
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,200
All right. I got it. It's out! It's out!

23
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,400
I got it. You're OK. You're OK.

24
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,600
- There he is.
- Hey, kid, it's good to see ya.

25
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:44,600
So you finally made the trip out here, huh?

26
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,000
Tony, this is my oldest, Charlie.

27
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,800
Nice to meet you.

28
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,400
Walk with me.

29
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,800
- Well?
- You in that suit.

30
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
Long way, huh?

31
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,400
- He lucked out. Got his mother's looks.
- Takes after her too.

32
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,600
He's in architectural salvage.

33
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,200
- Old fixtures, windows, toilets.
- Like Sanford and Son?

34
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,800
Didn't I tell ya he's quick?

35
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,200
- Good for you, Charlie.

36
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,800
And this is some more,
for the Joey Peeps thing.

37
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,800
Not all of it.

38
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,000
He's OK.

39
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,400
- I did a clean job.
- Fuck it, it's embarrassing

40
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,400
but that's the way
Little Carmine and Rusty are doin' things now.

41
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm sorry, but Rusty,
I think he bangs his wife in instalments.

42
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,665
This guy was my old man,
my rabbi and my priest rolled into one.

43
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,500
I don't miss a day of it
but the parts with this fireplug were the best.

44
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:05,600
Get the fuck outta here.

45
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
I almost forgot.

46
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,600
It spoke to me on account
of your sense of humour and all.

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm puttin' this in a position of prominence.

48
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,900
Hey, how ya doin'?

49
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,600
Are you gonna operate on me?

50
00:05:57,635 --> 00:06:00,900
No, it's... It's me, Tony.

51
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,900
They gotta fight infection.

52
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,400
- My hair.
- Well, the good news is it'll grow back.

53
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,800
And the burns are second degree so you don't
need a skin graft or that hyperbolic chamber.

54
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,700
You're gonna look the same as you always did.

55
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,900
Fuck you.

56
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,000
All right, one second.

57
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,865
- All right.
- It hurts.

58
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,600
OK, sit tight, rest.
They gotta keep ya in here a couple days

59
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,700
so we don't get no bacteria in there.

60
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,800
Are you gonna operate on me?

61
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm gonna take care of everything -
the doctor bills,

62
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:41,300
a wig, whatever.

63
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,200
And don't worry about nothin'.

64
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,900
I gotta go.

65
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Just put it in there.

66
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,000
- Let me get some twine.
- Forget it, I'm not goin' that far.

67
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,550
I know. I know, you fuck.

68
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,800
Come on. Let's go. Move on.

69
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Fucking great.

70
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,500
Listen, I don't know what the fuck
you were lookin' at...

71
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,400
- The fuck is this?
- Ange, sorry about that.

72
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
We were on our way to your place
and Billy sees you drive by.

73
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,200
- I tried to get your attention.
- Why didn't ya use a phone?

74
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:02,800
I'm an old man.
I don't see so good in the dark!

75
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,865
Jesus, relax. Johnny wants to see you.

76
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,700
- This late? I'll see him tomorrow.
- Apparently it's gotta be now.

77
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:12,700
You know, he's in one of his moods.

78
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,800
Fine. I'll follow ya over.

79
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,200
Whatever, let's go.

80
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
No, you don't!

81
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,600
Jesus, don't! Phil, please!

82
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,765
Philly! Philly, you know me.

83
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,400
- You couldn't fuckin' retire?
- Philly, you know me!

84
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,800
Look at this shit.
You know the work I just had?

85
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,800
Gimme the fuckin' keys.

86
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,500
Mirsa, you seen today's paper?

87
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,300
Everything in the kitchen, Mr Tony!

88
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,600
God-fuckin'- dammit.

89
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,800
- Do you know this is today's paper?
- Oh, no...

90
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,200
This is today's paper, Mirsa.

91
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,200
That's, I'm thinking.

92
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,600
- Why'd you throw it away?
- Oh, no.

93
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,100
Jesus Christ, forget it.

94
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,100
I bake you some enchiladas you like.

95
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Thank you. That's nice of you.

96
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,600
These are for you. Enchiladas.

97
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
I came for my money.

98
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,200
I'll talk to Carlo and tell him
why you're kickin' up directly to me this week.

99
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:36,800
I gotta be careful gettin' into my cash
on account of Carmela.

100
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,665
She's all over that.

101
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,000
- You buyin' that wave runner?
- Oh, I'm movin' to The Plaza.

102
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,200
That fuckin' house
is fallin' down around my ears.

103
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,165
We did good at the casino last night.

104
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,500
I dread goin' home. That Guatemalan,
she forgets her English whenever it suits her

105
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,800
and then she shows up
whenever she feels like with the enchiladas.

106
00:10:57,835 --> 00:10:59,800
So fire her ass, get a new one.

107
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,200
This is the new one.

108
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,400
I been in the burn ward
a couple of nights with Valentina.

109
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,800
Poor thing caught herself on fire.

110
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,865
No shit?

111
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,800
She's layin' there like a rag doll, the poor kid.

112
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,800
That smell - fuck, that burnin' hair smell -

113
00:11:27,835 --> 00:11:30,500
I can still smell it.

114
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,200
Jesus, you know that's the last thing
Carmine said before he had his stroke?

115
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,600
He smelled burnin' hair.

116
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,400
You got a Coke or somethin'?

117
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,200
Ma, can you get Tony a Coke?

118
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm upstairs!

119
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,100
Jason, Justin, get up here!

120
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,600
- You all right?
- I just got the kids up my ass, that's all.

121
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,400
So, you come across any burn victims
at that hospital in the can?

122
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,900
Sure, Aryan guys are always
settin' each other on fire.

123
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,365
So what's she in for?

124
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
You know, the future, I mean.

125
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,600
They said she don't need no skin grafts.

126
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,100
Seriously, what the fuck is with you?

127
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,300
I just told you.

128
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,100
You know the tough part is
this girl is a constant pain in my ass.

129
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,600
I was gonna end it right there, that night

130
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,200
and now how the fuck is it gonna look?

131
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
That is a tough one.

132
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,800
How the fuck does this shit
always happen to me?

133
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,800
You know what I been thinkin' about lately?

134
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:57,865
Charmaine Bucco.

135
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,500
- Nice set on her.
- No, not like that.

136
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
Well, maybe like that.

137
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,000
But also, she's a fantastic cook.

138
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,700
She's better than Artie in some ways.

139
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:14,265
Plus she's a licensed notary public.

140
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,400
I'm thinkin' that this is
the kind of woman I need.

141
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,200
And it almost worked
between me and her, right?

142
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,300
Comic books, juice boxes,
robot crap all over the place.

143
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,500
Get your uncle a Coke and then your stuff.
I'm takin' ya back to your mom's early.

144
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,100
- I should take off.
- Yeah, I gotta run them over there now.

145
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,800
- I'll see ya later.
- All right.

146
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,100
- I'll come over to the hotel.
- Yeah.

147
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,865
- Lawrence wedding?
- No.

148
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,700
- Long-term or short-term?
- Can't you just park it?

149
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,100
Keep it outta the horse shit over there.

150
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,600
Oh, yeah. Beautiful, ladies. Here we go.

151
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,800
Although you're paying cash,
we need to see a credit card for incidentals -

152
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,400
- minibar, parking et cetera.
- Right.

153
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,050
Oh, Jill, that's so funny.

154
00:14:58,085 --> 00:15:00,200

Anything else I can do,
press nine, ask for Jesûs.

161
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,400
- For you.
- Thank you, sir. Enjoy your stay.

162
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,300
All major credit cards are accepted.

171
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,300
What are you waiting for?

172
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,000
I've been trying to reach you.
Angelo got it. Last night.

173
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,000
Probably Phil.

174
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,300
I'm not available right now.
Don't leave messages on this phone.

175
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:54,100
Fuck!

176
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,000
- Hello?
- Who's this?

177
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,800
- Dot. Who's this?
- Tony looking for Tone.

178
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,965
He's not here.
He didn't come in tonight at all.

179
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,200
He might be in later.
You wanna try his portable phone?

180
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,600
I did. You see him,

181
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,100
you have him call me, immediately.

182
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
OK, will do.

183
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,200
Yeah, Aunt Quin, it's Tony looking for Tone.

184
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,600
Madonna, I was hoping he was with you.

185
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,000
- You heard from him?
- Not since he took the kids back this morning.

186
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,500
Call me if you hear, you understand?
You got my cell?

187
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,700
Yeah. What's wrong?

188
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,365
- You seen my cousin?
- No.

189
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,100
But I heard about that thing last night.
The old timer was a stand-up guy.

190
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,500
Yeah, well, that's the least of it.

191
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,600
Hold on.

192
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,100
- Hey, you call for a date?
- Yeah.

193
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,400
- Got company?
- Yeah.

194
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,700
- Hold on a second.
- Can I get a drink?

195
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,900
- I wanna know the minute he surfaces.
- You got it.

196
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,100
I saw him today. He must've known
cos he was acting all squirrelly.

197
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:39,700
He's got a right to be upset
after what him and Ange been through.

198
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,800
- They were cell mates.
- I got a bad feeling about this.

199
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:46,800
Don't worry about it. He ain't that stupid.

200
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,000
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- We'll let you know if we see him.

201
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,100
You want me to suck your dick now, baby?

202
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Is that what you want, baby?

203
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
What the fuck?

204
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,000
Tony, I'm so lonely.

205
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,265
I miss my Violet.

206
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,300
- What violin?
- Violet, my wife.

207
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,400
She was everything to me.

208
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,400
I'm all alone on the other side.

209
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,200
It ain't right.

210
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,200
Answer the fucking thing.

211
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,300
If it's him, tell him you ain't seen me.

212
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,800
- Tell who?
- The man upstairs.

213
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,300
We need you to do something.

214
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,900
- Like what?
- Our friend.

215
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He's gotta go.

216
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,200
- No problem.
- Don't fuck it up. It's important.

217
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,200
I know it's important.

218
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,600
He was staring straight at me
and he didn't look dead.

219
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,400
Any deader than he ever did, anyways.

220
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,500
And he says...

221
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,400
"I miss my wife. "

222
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,000
Then the phone rings and...

223
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,000
there was this voice.

224
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,600
They wanted me to do something.

225
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,400
What?

226
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,000
They wanted me to kill a guy.

227
00:23:17,035 --> 00:23:19,300
It was just a dream, all right?

228
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,300
He must be in heaven - he said the other side -

229
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
but he was so fucking sad.

230
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,400
Doesn't sound like heaven to me.

231
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,000
You would know more about it than I do.

232
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,600
What do you see in me, anyways?

233
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,000
The object is to learn what you saw in me,
not what I saw in you.

234
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:48,400
"One of these days, Alice. One of these days. "

235
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:50,665
"Pow! Right in the kisser?"

236
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,800
- "To the moon, Alice!"
- I remember when ya hit me.

237
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,200
It was like, "Pow! To the moon. "

238
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,000
"Don't get me steamed, Alice!"

239
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,665
Then, you choked the shit outta me!

240
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,500
Yeah, but that's after
you had tried to put a fork in my eye.

241
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:06,200
That was your mother!

242
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,500
What happens here is like taking a shit.

243
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,500
I prefer to think of it as more like childbirth.

244
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,100
Maybe it is more like childbirth.

245
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
You tell me.

246
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
I don't have any children.

247
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
I died too young.

248
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,900
My cousin does a mean Gleason.

249
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,400
Are you ready for what you have to do?

250
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,300
No sweat. I did my homework.

251
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,100
- You wanna ride up front?
- No, Dad, I'm fine.

252
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,300
Kid gets sick in the back seat.

253
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,400
You know, douche-bag, I realise I'm dreaming.

254
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,300
I got no opinion, one way or the other.

255
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,600
Anybody mind?

256
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,600
What?

257
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,600
Where are we going?

258
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,200
Driving you to the job.

259
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,000
Jesus, you scared me.

260
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,865
You're not ready.
We gotta meet Finn's parents.

261
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,200
- Why didn't you wake me?
- Is that how you're gonna dress?

262
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,500
My stuff isn't here.

263
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,000
You left your brown suit.

264
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,500
I did?

265
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,465
And we're late.

266
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,000
- I had the worst fucking dream.
- Tony, we're late.

267
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:54,200
- And we should take separate cars.
- Oh, yeah.

268
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:01,100
Howdy. You were riding out here
the other day, weren't ya?

269
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,800
You speak English?

270
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,200
- Tony...
- What? Gimme a minute.

271
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,800
Can't you pull yourself away?
Your head is filled with this stuff.

272
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,600
It's just that it's so much more interesting.

273
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:23,000
- Than what?
- Than life.

274
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,600
What, are you kidding me? It is your life.

275
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,600
Good morning, signor.

276
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,600
Tell me, what day is it?

277
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,200
What day?
Why, it's Christmas Day, of course, sir.

278
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,300
Christmas Dayl Christmas Dayl
Then I haven't missed itl

279
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,500
The spirits must've done
everything in one night.

280
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:48,300
Will you please get dressed?

281
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,000
Look at you.

282
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,300
All right, let's go.

283
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
I'll wait in the car.

284
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,100
I'll wait in the car.

285
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,400
- Now what's the matter?
- Nothing.

286
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,000
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

287
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,500
Hi. How are you both?

288
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,200
There you are. I was getting so nervous.

289
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,865
Hiya, babe.

290
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,200
- We were about to start calling the hospitals.
- Somebody forgot.

291
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,000
I'd like you to meet Finn's parents.
Mr DeTrolio and Mrs DeTrolio.

292
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,500
- How do you do?
- How do you do? Nice to meet you.

293
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,600
We've been enjoying
getting to know your daughter.

294
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,865
- So, how's the food here?
- It's pretty good.

295
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,800
We went to high school
with the owner and his wife.

296
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,300
You two were high-school sweethearts?

297
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,800
- So, how long can you stay?
- Something I have to take care of.

298
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,400
Show them what you have in your pocket.

299
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,000
With a husband in dental school,
he'll be able to fix your mouth, honey.

300
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:03,300
Then for the capper.

301
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,600
Son of a bitch.

302
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,300
We know all about you, and I think it's great.

303
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,300
Well, that's a relief, huh, Tony?

304
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,600
Speaking of dental school, people told us
Finn would never amount to much.

305
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,100
He won't. I think the die is cast.

306
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,600
If it wasn't for his Tooth Fairy money,
he'd have nothing.

307
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,800
Let's not get into it in public.

308
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,700
- Well, you're the one that said...
- Never mind. Please, just drop it.

309
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,700
- So, Meadow, do you play an instrument?
- I was in chamber singers.

310
00:30:41,735 --> 00:30:44,400
I used to sing in the Navy Glee Club.

311
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
You're Annette Bening.

312
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,600
I thought so.

313
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,800
What?

314
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,300
Something bad is gonna happen.

315
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,600
After I sing, I can usually use a nice tinkle.

316
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,100
I'll go with ya.

317
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,100
I don't want my husnband coming back
with just his cock in his hand.

318
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:31,200
Mine either. Believe me.

319
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,300
That feels good.

320
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,500
- You don't do this no more, huh?
- No.

321
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,265
You got a good boy out there.

322
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,000
Are you gonna be able to come through
on the thing?

323
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,000
I did my homework.

324
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,150
Well, the piece wasn't behind the toilet.

325
00:33:19,185 --> 00:33:22,000
- This is real life.
- No, it's not.

326
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,300
This is it.

327
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,600
Stop!

328
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,400
- I knew this was gonna happen.
- Why didn't you stop him?

329
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,400
Please.

330
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Do you have any idea what you just did?

331
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,100
Tell them what happened 20 years ago.

332
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,400
I can't go into that right now.

333
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,900
What do I gotta count to before I can get up?

334
00:34:23,935 --> 00:34:26,300
- Tony?
- You're really dead.

335
00:34:26,335 --> 00:34:28,400
But I got kids.

336
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,900
They got kids.

337
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,400
Yo, wasn't that Tony there
the guy you were supposed to cap

338
00:34:39,435 --> 00:34:42,800
- to prevent this from happening?
- I don't know.

339
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,800
I guess not.

340
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,500
I don't have a piece.

341
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,200
- Annette Bening?
- There's something "Bugsy" about him.

342
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,400
Get him!

343
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,100
Over here!

344
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,800
I'm wiped out.

345
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,400
What the fuck you doing to yourself?

346
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,400
- What's that noise?
- It's those micks outside the hotel

347
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,165
- with those carriage rides.
- Tell 'em to go away.

348
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,800
Oh, God, Tony, it's so much better
than when we were kids.

349
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,300
See, what'd I tell ya? The best, huh?

350
00:36:15,335 --> 00:36:17,700
She likes it when you rub her muzzle.

351
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,200
I think I wanna come home.

352
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,500
- There are some non-negotiable conditions.
- Like what?

353
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:35,265
- You can't have your horse in here.
- Why not?

354
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,600
Are you kidding me?
The smell and shit all over the place.

355
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,600
- I'll clean up after her.
- You always say that.

356
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,600
- I'll have to think about it.
- You brought it up.

357
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,265
I should go.

358
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,200
You didn't take care of that?

359
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,200
But...

360
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,000
check this out.

361
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Be careful.

362
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,300
I know you're there, Soprano.

363
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,100
Well, come on. You're gonna do it, do it.

364
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,900
- Well, look at you.
- How you doing, Coach Molinaro?

365
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Me, I'm fine.
What's that you got there?

366
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:27,400
A bigger dingus than the one God gave ya?

367
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,200
You dumb ass.

368
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,400
You know, you oughta show some respect.

369
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,600
- Why?
- Cos I'm not some kid any more.

370
00:39:38,635 --> 00:39:40,000
No?

371
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,065
What did I tell you?

372
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,300
Cleave yourself away from them bums
you hang with, I said.

373
00:39:49,335 --> 00:39:51,000
Well, I'm in therapy now.

374
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,400
That's a damn shame.

375
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,700
You all listened to that pismire, Arthur Bucco!
He was the worst of the bunch! I told you.

376
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,500
Artie owns a restaurant. He's doing great.

377
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:05,900
- Bucco?
- Yeah.

378
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,950
- So what? The exception that proves the rule.
- You know everything.

379
00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:13,900
I suppose you blame it on your father
when you're crying to that shrink.

380
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,800
No, more my mother.

381
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,400
Of course, even better.

382
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,665
My family was different
than other kids' families.

383
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,100
I bet you got that psyhcologist
wrapped around your finger.

384
00:40:26,135 --> 00:40:28,600
That's what you always told me I was good at.

385
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:33,800
I also told you, most likely,
you'd take the easy way out.

386
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,600
It hasn't been easy!

387
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,165
- I see you on TV.
- Oh, yeah?

388
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,200
Some show you put on.
The Five O'Clock News.

389
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,000
Then you realise
I got nothing to apologise to you for.

390
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,200
I am a leader!
Got a house worth a million two!

391
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,200
Two kids, wife.

392
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,450
- Do you?
- Do I what?

393
00:41:00,485 --> 00:41:02,200
- Have a wife?
- Yeah.

394
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,200
She's got the big house, cos I'm successful.

395
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,965
You and I know your little secret.

396
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I only told you I wanted to be a coach cos
I liked playing ball. I was just shining you on.

397
00:41:14,035 --> 00:41:17,300
I told you many times, Anthony,
you were special.

398
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,200
You had smarts, personality,
leadership potential -

399
00:41:21,235 --> 00:41:24,400
all the prerequisites to lead young men
on the field.

400
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,600
And now look at the stress you live with.

401
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,200
You are not prepared!

402
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,900
You'll never shut me up!

403
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,900
We're sorry to disturb you at this hour, sir,
but there's a Mr Montevani to see you.

404
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:42,600
- He says it's urgent.
- Send him up.

405
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,400
Sorry to get you up
but I knew you'd wanna know right away.

406
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,000
Know what?

407
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,000
Tony B took out Billy Leotardo.

408
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,450
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute. You mean Philly?

409
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:43,565
Billy. Phil got winged. He's in the hospital.

410
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,500
TB went ape over Angelo. Phil holds
his little brother as the kid dies in his arms.

411
00:43:48,535 --> 00:43:50,500
There's blood all over Phil.

412
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,500
Jesus.

413
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So he knew.

414
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,400
God damn him.

415
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:06,100
He knew what he was gonna do when he sat
there in his mother's house and pretended.

416
00:44:06,135 --> 00:44:08,600
Lied right to my face.

417
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,800
I don't know what to say.

418
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,300
Guess TB's fucked, poor guy.

419
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,100
Poor guy?

420
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,200
We're all fucked.

421
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,300
I'm here for you, whatever.

422
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,200
I know that.

423
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,400
Nice suite, T.

424
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,300
Anyway,
I thought you needed to know right away.

425
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,600
You gonna eat that?

426
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,600
- No, take it.
- Thanks.

427
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,800
All right. See ya later.

428
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,300
Don't get alarmed.
I'm sorry to call you so early

429
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:01,300
but I gotta cancel the fishing trip.

430
00:46:01,335 --> 00:46:03,700
- Tell AJ.
- You all right?

431
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,000
I had one of my Coach Molinaro dreams.

432
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,800
Oh, yeah? Were you unprepared as usual?

433
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,365
Yeah. As usual.

434
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,500
Mr Mol. I wonder where he is now.

435
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,400
He wasn't such a bad guy.

436
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:34,400
- A bad guy, no. He took an interest in you.
- A lotta that was bullshit.

437
00:46:34,435 --> 00:46:39,300
It was just his way of keeping me
from causing trouble. Make his life easier.

438
00:46:39,335 --> 00:46:41,300
I don't know about that.

439
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,200
I told him in the dream
I am sort of a coach now.

440
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,500
That's a way of looking at it, I guess.

441
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,500
Is it daylight where you are?

442
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,400
Nope. Where are you?

443
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Looking out at Central Park.

444
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,200
All the lights are on.

445
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,200
- You were in the dream too.
- Oh yeah?

446
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,300
I was on this horse.

447
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,265
Anyway, is Artie all right?

448
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:34,000
In the dream, he was the only alive guy
in this car full of dead guys.

449
00:47:34,035 --> 00:47:36,500
I had dinner over there last night.

450
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,300
Who'd you eat with?

451
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,400
Gab and Ro.

452
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,600
- That's nice.
- It was all right.

453
00:47:45,635 --> 00:47:47,600
The veal was very dry.

454
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,700
Is that Esterhaz next door barking?

455
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,600
- Can you hear him?
- Absolutely.

456
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,800
5:30 in the morning.

457
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,800
Someone oughta serve him some veal -
à la strychnine.

458
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,400
- Stop it.
- I'm serious.

459
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,800
Is it light where you are yet?

460
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,700
English
