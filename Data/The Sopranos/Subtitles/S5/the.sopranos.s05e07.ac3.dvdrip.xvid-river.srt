1
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,850
Don't tell me we fight. I try to get along.

2
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:45,265
You can't just say
whatever comes to mind.

3
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,100
You were horrible.
That shit about the roadies...

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,800
You hit below the belt yourself, Jan,
and you started it.

5
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,900
No cheese for Sophia.

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,600
Those kids seem to like you, sort of.

7
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,800
I leave them completely free to do
whatever they want.

8
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:03,900
How else are they gonna learn
from their mistakes?

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,600
Anyway, thank you for having us over.

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,100
What's this you're watching?

11
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:18,100
Beethoven.

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,200
- Can we get a dog?
- Please?

13
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,800
I'll walk him,
and I'll pick up the poo and pee.

14
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:33,800
Pee? Right. Start with your underwear.

15
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,500
We had a dog, remember? Tippy?

16
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,800
He got worms though,
had to move to the country.

17
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,565
Tippy was gassed, Tony.
Daddy took him to the pound.

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,000
He used to drag his ass on the carpet
just to scratch himself.

19
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:55,300
- My mother went crazy.
- Gassed?

20
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,300
And he's so cynical about everything else.

21
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:01,200
Father told me
he took him to live on a farm.

22
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,500
That's what they always say. That same
farm must have 17 billion dogs on it.

23
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,200
Dogshit up to the rafters.

24
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,965
What? Oh, no, that's terrible.

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,700
- What? What's the matter?
- It's Cousin Josephine. Aunt Concett' died.

26
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,800
- What happened?
- They think it was a heart attack.

27
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,500
Uncle Zio found her on the couch
after Meet The Press.

28
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,300
We hereby commend Concetta to the Lord

29
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:37,200
embraced in His divine goodness.

30
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,100
- Let us go in peace. Amen.
- Amen.

31
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,100
Listen, as long as we're here

32
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,000
I was gonna go visit my father.

33
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,900
Like to join me?

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,100
Five hours, they let me out for these funerals.
I gotta spend it bein' maudlin?

35
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,900
It's a beautiful day.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,600
I thought you might wanna pay your respects
to your brother.

37
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:09,865
By crying to a chunk of marble?

38
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,000
I can pay my respects from the after-party.

39
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,400
After-party?

40
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,200
It's those uptake inhibitors. We were sceptical
at first, then his mood improved.

41
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,300
His memory, too.

42
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,700
Excuse me.

43
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Excuse me. Hi.

44
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
- Oh, hello.
- You knew my mother?

45
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,400
You're Anthony. Oh, my God.

46
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,000
- Do I know you?
- Oh, no.

47
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,600
- No, no, you're not annoying me.
- No, no... Do we know each other?

48
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,465
Oh, we met once.

49
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,300
I was a friend of your father's.

50
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,800
You're the lady from Bamberger's...
from the fur department.

51
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:27,500
- Fran Felstein.
- Tony.

52
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
How you doin'?

53
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,000
So what, you... You come visit?

54
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,600
I miss your father sometimes. It's...

55
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:41,965
It's foolish.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,365
Nah, don't say that.

57
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,200
No, I was sorry to hear about your mother.

58
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,400
At least she didn't suffer.

59
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
She made all of us suffer instead.

60
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,300
Oh, it was a joke. She made all of us suffer.

61
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,200
Believe me,
I heard the stories from your dad.

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,100
You must forgive me.
My hearing... the last few years...

63
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,400
How about a hearin' aid?
They're little now. You can't see 'em.

64
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:16,900
I'm too vain. Anyway...
Johnny was very proud of you.

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,800
You were very special to him.

66
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,165
I'm sure you were too.

67
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Johnny told me if I ever needed anything
I should always call his son.

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,100
What do you need?

69
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,900
Not a thing.

70
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,865
Fran Felstein?

71
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,200
- That was class.
- She's got great legs for an old broad.

72
00:06:47,235 --> 00:06:49,400
I was in love with that woman.

73
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,900
She was the reason I never married.
I wanted to propose.

74
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,600
- I had the ring all picked out.
- So what? She turned you down?

75
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:02,200
I hesitated. How could I bring
this life we live on a woman?

76
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,165
Anyway,
she took it as a sign I wasn't interested.

77
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,600
Then one night we were all at the 500 Club
to see Enzo Stuarti. Your father shows up.

78
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,800
Sy Devore suit, two-inch lapel - that was that.

79
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,100
She never knew my feelings. What could I do?

80
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,700
For years, I suffered in silence.

81
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,600
Mario, did you bring your guitar?

82
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:34,600
Not to this.

83
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,800
- Angie, come on. Sing us a song.
- You sing, Junior.

84
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,700
Nobody wants to hear me.

85
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Mario, remember?

86
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Thanks, my name's JT.
I'm an alcoholic and an addict.

87
00:07:58,635 --> 00:07:59,765
Hi, JT.

88
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,300
I'm also a TV writer which, by default,
makes me a douche bag,

89
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,700
but you would've figured that out
for yourselves.

90
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,000
About 15 years ago,
I moved from Jersey to Hollywood

91
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,600
broke into the biz.

92
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,250
It was a dream come true. I had money,

93
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,765
I had the Beemer, the actress girlfriend.

94
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,200
Best of all, I had all the flake I needed
to keep me churning out that snappy dialogue.

95
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:31,200
Drugs, alcohol - that shit practically
comes with the Writers' Guild card.

96
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,100
Anyway,

97
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
before too long, I discovered heroin.

98
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,600
Then things really started to fall apart.

99
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,700
It got so bad
that I blew a deadline on a Nash Bridges.

100
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,165
I got my ass fired. I didn't work for 18 months.

101
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,200
By the grace of God, I got myself
into a rehab programme in Pennsylvania

102
00:08:57,235 --> 00:09:02,200
and, with the help of some good friends
that I made there, I got through it.

103
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,000
Chris, where are you?
There's my man Chris, everybody.

104
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Anyway, I wanna talk a little bit about
takin' a moral inventory.

105
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
So we talked for, like, an hour.

106
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, it turns out that they had a thing,
her and my old man. Right up till he died.

107
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:26,300
He got from this woman
what he couldn't get at home.

108
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,765
Support...

109
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,565
You know, love.

110
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,900
A smile when you walk in the fuckin' door.

111
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:36,200
Do you think that justifies his infidelity?

112
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,600
She drove him into that woman's arms,
my mother. To all his women.

113
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll tell you one thing.
Over the years he was rottin' in that grave

114
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,000
I can't remember once
my mother goin' to visit him.

115
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But this lady, Fran...

116
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,065
It's possible your mother found it very painful.

117
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,800
- Oh, poor her.
- What was it like sitting there with Fran?

118
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
A little weird at first...

119
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,800
Here I am comforting my father's mistress.
My mother's lyin' there, dead.

120
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:17,100
- Are you attracted to her?
- She's old enough to be my mother!

121
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,300
Oh, Jesus Christ, it's an expression.

122
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,800
Don't cream yourself.
I did not want to fuck my mother!

123
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,900
You should've seen her in her hairnet.
This conversation'd be over in two seconds.

124
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:35,800
So, I figured, why not move back to Jersey?

125
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,065
Clean slate. It's better.

126
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,200
My new agent? Next week,
he's got me set up to meet Dick Wolf's guy.

127
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:44,200
I seen Dick Wolf at Rao's one night.

128
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,300
Guy's got his own limo.

129
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,800
That Law And Order money?
The guy could have his own battleship.

130
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:54,300
But, enough of my shit. How are you doin'?

131
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,665
Good, you know.

132
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,100
Workin' the programme.

133
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,365
I had some fuckin' wine, all right?
Is that what you wanna hear?

134
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,800
- Christopher, when was this?
- I don't know. My fiancée was in a car crash.

135
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,600
I didn't even like it.
I went to a meeting the next day.

136
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,300
But no slip since then?

137
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,300
I've been sober and I've been high.
Sober's better.

138
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,700
- You know you can call me any time?
- What? You got a date?

139
00:11:30,735 --> 00:11:33,200
I gotta meet somebody, a friend.

140
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,300
- Go ahead, I'll get this.
- Thanks, bro.

141
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:39,600
Listen, call me. I'm serious.

142
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,100
- Harold Melvoin.
- Mel, it's me.

143
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,100
- Corrado, what's up?
- There's a funeral I need to attend.

144
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,700
I want you to call the feds.

145
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:13,565
Vincent Patronella.

146
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,565
Is he a relative? You know the rules.

147
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,100
He's my niece's godfather. I think I met him
at a barbecue for the bicentennial.

148
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:22,700
All they can say is no.

149
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,300
Your father used to bring me flowers
all the time - flowers and lingerie.

150
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,400
I'm making chicken,
Cuban style with black beans.

151
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,000
What's this?

152
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,700
Ketchup? Sure. If you want.

153
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,300
No, the kid and the dog.

154
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,065
My son, Bruce.

155
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,700
He married an Israeli girl.
He's a food service director with El Al.

156
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
- No, no, no, the dog.
- Oh, Freckles?

157
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,700
- He was a gift from your dad.
- What?

158
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,500
Aw, when?

159
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,600
Oh, this is my fuckin' dog!

160
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,300
Excuse me, I'm sorry. This was my dog!
His name was Tippy!

161
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,200
Your dad never said.

162
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,100
I don't fuckin' believe this.

163
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
My mother made him give the dog away.

164
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:31,765
Well, Bruce loved him.

165
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,100
He had him for almost ten years,
till he moved to Tel Aviv.

166
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,700
Then I had to put him to sleep.

167
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,100
Those are the pictures, on the coffee table.

168
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,900
The slippers were your dad's, too.

169
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,200
Look at this. The two of you.

170
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,300
He used to remind me of Victor Mature.

171
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,500
Outside the Latin Quarter.

172
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,400
- Holy shit, look at Hesh. George Gershwin.
- He was a whoremaster, and cheap.

173
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,300
He screwed me out of my retirement money.

174
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,765
Against your dad's wishes, by the way.

175
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,100
- What are you talkin' about?
- Don't get me started.

176
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,800
- Come on, what happened?
- Your dad owned a racetrack.

177
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,700
With the midget auto racing.

178
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,000
The Chickamauga Raceway
over in New Egypt.

179
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,900
Him, Herman, some other guy...

180
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,000
- Phil something. With the hair, from New York.
- Leotardo.

181
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,000
My father cut him in to pay off a poker debt.

182
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,600
Johnny always told me
his piece would go to me.

183
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Couldn't put me in his will, obviously.

184
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,400
When he passed, your dad...

185
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
I called Hesh.

186
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,400
He sent me 500 bucks.

187
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:13,700
That's it?

188
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,800
I'm sorry.

189
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,000
Jesus Christ, I wish you'd called me.

190
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,400
- Bruce sends me money occasionally.
- That's not the point. It's my father's wishes.

191
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:32,500
Look, forget it. Seriously, I'm sorry.

192
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,100
I shouldn't have even brought it up.

193
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,700
Listen, after we eat, you wanna take a ride?

194
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,000
So I saw my Uncle Jun'.

195
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
- He says to say hello.
- Junior?

196
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,665
Jesus. How's he doing?

197
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,900
I don't know if you know it,
but he was always a little hot for you.

198
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
He was practically a stalker.

199
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,100
- He said he suffered in silence.
- Suffered in silence?

200
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,365
He used to skulk outside my building, all hours.

201
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,900
Weird phone calls. I always had a hunch
he told Livia about me and Johnny.

202
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,200
Jesus Christ.

203
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,200
She was a handsome woman, your mother.

204
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,700
Not sexy, exactly, but statuesque.

205
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,500
Little nip?

206
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
- What is it?
- One for the road, honey.

207
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
And this looks like road to me.

208
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,100
Rémy Martin, VSOP.

209
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,600
They can't be making much,
but if I know Hesh

210
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,300
him and Phil got something going on here.

211
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,700
So, tell me about your women.

212
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Your wife, what's she like?

213
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,700
I don't know. What's to tell?

214
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Good woman, good mother.

215
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,400
Marriage hit the rocks, that's all.
What are you gonna do?

216
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,000
How about your girlfriend?

217
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,200
She's an art dealer. Very sophisticated.

218
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,100
Dark hair, dark eyes. She's Latin.

219
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,200
You know, from Spain.

220
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's it.

221
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,100
Oh, man, I'm so glad you called.
I really needed this.

222
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,165
- So?
- So, what?

223
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,900
There's nothing you wanna talk about?

224
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:01,600
I was honest with you the other night.

225
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,565
- You're telling me you're not using?
- What?

226
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,700
You ran out of IHOP like you were on fire
and jonesing like a motherfucker.

227
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:14,700
I was going with a girl to the track.
The Meadowlands.

228
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,600
I didn't wanna miss the last race.

229
00:18:16,635 --> 00:18:19,665
I am totally clean and sober.

230
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,900
Jesus Christ.
I was positive you fucking slipped.

231
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,800
Thank you, man. I appreciate your concern.

232
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,300
I could have saved you a trip.
I'll take your action.

233
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:38,000
You take a dime each
on the Yankees and St. Louis?

234
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,165
Whoa, high roller.

235
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,800
I just got a three grand residual
on a That's Life episode.

236
00:18:44,835 --> 00:18:48,000
What, that fake guinea-fest with Paul Sorvino?

237
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,200
That was totally unrealistic.

238
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,400
So dusty here.

239
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,200
- That silk?
- It ain't Kleenex. It's linen.

240
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
You know, you're very...

241
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
I don't know, you got a lot of class.

242
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,200
Just like your girlfriend.

243
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,000
He told me to look out for her
so I sent her some money. No one else did.

244
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:28,400
- So you keep his end for yourself?

245
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,100
I should give it to some trollop?
Besides, I thought I had it coming.

246
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:36,100
With Leotardo in the can,
who's been running that place, huh?

247
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:38,900
Collecting the rent, filing the taxes, all that?

248
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,200
What about my share?
All those years, I never saw a dime.

249
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,000
You're my father's friend, Hesh. My friend!

250
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,700
- So how come I never see you?
- What?

251
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,700
I see you. I'm fucking busy.

252
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,550
Never too busy to call me at two am
to hear your problems.

253
00:19:58,585 --> 00:20:02,265
One time, that happened.
My therapist was on vacation.

254
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:07,450
You want his end, kid, you got it. It's
25 per cent. The closing is not for two weeks.

255
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:12,600
And I would appreciate it if you tell Leotardo
he should assume part of that burden.

256
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:16,600
Well, despite how you feel,
my father loved this woman.

257
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,800
She's not such a bad person,
but I don't know.

258
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,300
Something about her
always rubbed me the wrong way.

259
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,100
- Maybe cos she was rubbing him and not you.
- How long you know me, bub, huh?

260
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:30,400
She's a little pale for my taste.

261
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,700
Mr Patronella was last week.
This is a different one.

262
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,600
Yes, I'm aware
he's been to two funerals in a month.

263
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,200
Well, people die, Counselor.

264
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,500
The deceased in question now, Mrs Crilley,

265
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:55,500
was the sister of Mr Soprano's cousin.

266
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
By marriage.

267
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,365
So she's not a blood relative per se.

268
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,200
For God's sake,
the man wants to pay his respects.

269
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,000
Well, perhaps my next call should be
to Judge Runions.

270
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,400
Five hours, it's not a Hawaiian vacation.

271
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,600
He'll attend the church service
then pay his respects to the family.

272
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,800
Thank you, Counselor. We appreciate it.

273
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,500
You're worth every fucking cent!

274
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,200
They're gonna have
Scottish bagpipes at the funeral.

275
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,200
It should be interesting.

276
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,200
Don Provolone. See that fucking game?

277
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,400
- Diet Coke and whatever he's having.
- Ginger ale?

278
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,500
- Remind me to send Jeter a dozen roses.
- You wanna parlay it?

279
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,000
I was thinking I'd check out
that Indian casino, play some poker.

280
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:17,900
You want in a real game, I'll hook you up.

281
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,600
High stakes, exclusive clientele.

282
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,365
- David Lee Roth.
- I'll tell you, man.

283
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Playing cards, games of chance,
I never really dug it before.

284
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:35,500
I was never that good at math. But there's
something about that excitement that's so...

285
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
I don't know.

286
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,800
What is wrong? I win a bet,
you look like you're gonna cry.

287
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:44,100
I fucked up again.

288
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,700
My super came by this morning
to fucking caulk around the toilet.

289
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,700
- He had some weed.
- You have got to call someone

290
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
before you use, not after.

291
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,200
I know, I know. I just wanted to see
if I could get high like a normal person.

292
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,800
You're not normal. Neither of us are.

293
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,600
On top of that,
you ask me to meet you at a bar?

294
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,900
Come here, you maniac.

295
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,165
625K for the track plus all that land? That's it?

296
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,300
Zoning restrictions.
We're lucky we got a buyer at all.

297
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,100
Here's what I propose...

298
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,300
Tony gets 150.

299
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,300
25 per cent comes from you,
the other 75 per cent of that comes from Hesh.

300
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,000
That's 40 grand.
You gotta be fucking kidding me, John.

301
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,600
Am I smiling?

302
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,550
You got some balls, kid, I'll give you that.

303
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:43,900
- You'll give me what I tell you to.
- Whoa.

304
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,365
- Take it easy.
- Fuck that!

305
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,965
This ain't the '70s. And I'm not a kid.

306
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,700
- Relax, it's an expression.
- Here's another one.

307
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:55,000
You got five days to give me my money.

308
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,800
Come on.

309
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,300
- That was out of line.
- Philly, he's a boss.

310
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,700
Jersey? Come on, huh?

311
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,100
Well, I talked to Phil and Hesh
about the racetrack.

312
00:24:18,135 --> 00:24:20,365
How bad did they bullshit you?

313
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,765
Actually, we straightened it all out.

314
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,600
So when the sale goes through,
you're looking at a nice piece of change.

315
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,465
You're kidding?

316
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,100
Hey, that's wonderful.

317
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
I wanted to show you something.

318
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,500
You were admiring my handkerchief.

319
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,600
Check out the initials.

320
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,600
JFK? Holy shit! This was his?

321
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,800
You know, I have a hat of his.

322
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,300
A captain's hat I bought at an auction.

323
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,100
A lot of the friends don't like him,
you know, Ruby and all that shit.

324
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,300
- But, fuck, I was in grammar school.
- That's my lipstick.

325
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,900
We had a little thing.

326
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
- When he was president?
- March '61.

327
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:21,765
Right before the Bay of Pigs.

328
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,365
I was at the Copa with a girlfriend.

329
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,665
I'm wearing a new sable
and we meet Lem Billings.

330
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,200
Now, Lem is a school friend of Jack's
from Choate, but of course we had no idea.

331
00:25:32,235 --> 00:25:37,000
He insists that we join him
for some affair at the Pierre Hotel.

332
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,000
He won't take no.

333
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,200
He has a limo, we figure, "What the hell?"

334
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,100
We go over and he tells us

335
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,400
he's taking us to the presidential suite.

336
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,865
So we get up, out of the elevator.

337
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,500
We go in the suite.
It is crawling with models, celebrities.

338
00:25:58,535 --> 00:26:00,900
Peter Lawford, Sinatra.

339
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
- Jackie Gleason.
- No shit!

340
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,200
I'm looking around
and I glance across the room

341
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,050
and, suddenly, I am locking eyes

342
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:14,800
with John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

343
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,500
Yeah, he comes over.
He is a perfect gentleman.

344
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,900
He takes my coat,
he brings me a cocktail, introduces me around.

345
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:26,200
Finally, at the end of the night, and get this.

346
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,200
In the interests of national security, he says

347
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,565
he needs me to stay.

348
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,100
Since I'm wearing a sable,
he needs to personally interview me.

349
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,400
Make sure I'm not working for the Russians.

350
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:41,500
- He said that?
- Some line, huh?

351
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,300
- What was he like?
- Wonderful.

352
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,365
- So were you two an item?
- No. He called.

353
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,000
But after all, this man was the leader
of the free world. I mean, you know...

354
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,600
One weekend, I was supposed
to go down to DC, stay at the Ritz-Carlton.

355
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,965
Last minute, emergency meeting.

356
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,900
- Steel workers are going on strike.
- So it was just that one time?

357
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,100
You know, after the Bay of Pigs,
he was probably pretty busy.

358
00:27:12,135 --> 00:27:14,365
Yeah, I knew there were others.

359
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,965
Judy Campbell and Marilyn, of course.

360
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,550
We had something special, though.
Crazy passion.

361
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:24,100
That was something
your mother never understood.

362
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,565
When you're married to a powerful man

363
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,000
you damn well better make him feel powerful.

364
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,350
My mother?

365
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:36,465
Please.

366
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,200
I saw a picture of Livia on New Year's Eve.

367
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,900
She was dressed like a refugee.

368
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,400
I think I'm going to skip the coffee.
I got a meeting in the city.

369
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,600
Are you sure?

370
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Look...

371
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,065
Consider this an advance.

372
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,900
Get your phone turned on
and pay your rent.

373
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Your dad would be so proud.

374
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,300
He raised a real gentleman.

375
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,000
You trying to buy this pot?

376
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,500
800 and you'll know.

377
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
What the fuck.

378
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,100
Cowboys and three little Indians.

379
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
Fuck me!

380
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,900
I got a lot of big people
coming next week.

381
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,200
So when you write on TV, what do they have -

382
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,200
like one guy writes the words
for Dylan McDermott

383
00:28:50,235 --> 00:28:53,100
and one guy writes
for Nicholson's girlfriend?

384
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,800
- You write it all yourself.
- Oh, interesting.

385
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,400
So how you doing? You wanna take off?

386
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:04,665
I'm getting killed here.

387
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,700
I'm gonna go. I'm fucking shot.

388
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,100
- I'll call you tomorrow. You wanna work out?
- Sure, yeah, whatever.

389
00:29:11,135 --> 00:29:14,900
Four of clubs to Joe Hollywood,
jack for the car-wash king.

390
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Ten for Mr Vito.

391
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,700
Show Valentina you love her!

392
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
They were out of the Citrucel.

393
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,300
- Where are you going?
- Gotta order some flowers.

394
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,800
Sal from the dry-cleaner, his kid died.

395
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,100
Drowned in a Jacuzzi.
Seven years old, you believe it?

396
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:11,100
Fucking tragedy.

397
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,700
- Harold Melvoin.
- It's me. I got another funeral. A kid.

398
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,965
His father does my shirts.

399
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,600
- It has to be a relative.
- It is a relative, goddamn it!

400
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,700
My old man came over
with his great-great-grandfather.

401
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:39,700
- Guy had a club foot.
- Isn't that rather tenuous?

402
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,000
The whole village of Avellino
settled in this area. We gotta be related.

403
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:46,200
- Corrado...
- Corrado, my balls!

404
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,100
I've gotta get out of here.
I'm going stir-crazy.

405
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
7th Street coming out.

406
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,500
Holy shit. You're still here?

407
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,200
- Called you all day.
- We're in a hand here.

408
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,600
- What do you wanna do?
- Fold.

409
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,900
Here, fuck it. I'm all in.

410
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,400
- Call.
- Pair of tens.

411
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,600
Flush. Caught it on the river.

412
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,000
Motherfucking...

413
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
fuck!

414
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,565
How bad?

415
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,500
- He owes the house 57.
- Thousand?

416
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,800
- What are you? Fucking crazy?
- Define crazy.

417
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,100
I'm good for it. I'm up for this Dick Wolf thing.
If I get on staff, it's a month's salary.

418
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Well, how about this fucking month?

419
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,000
You think you could spot me for a while?

420
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,200
I got some child support, too.

421
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:12,000
I'll cover this, give you three grand
for incidentals. That's 60,000 altogether.

422
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,500
- I've only been up two days. I can still add.
- Good. Then add two points every week

423
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,165
- till I'm paid in full.
- You're charging me vig?

424
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,500
On top of the principal. It's compounded if
you're late. That's 1200 one week from today.

425
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,700
Don't give me that look.
This is your problem.

426
00:32:28,735 --> 00:32:31,000
I will not fucking enable you.

427
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,300
There he is! Philly!

428
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,300
- Phil, where you going?
- I gotta meet John at the restaurant.

429
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,200
You fucking cocksucker!

430
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,200
Where you gonna go, huh?
Where you gonna go?

431
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,200
Motherfucker!

432
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,500
Jesus Christ. Mister, you OK in there?

433
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,300
- Oh, my neck!
- You all right?

434
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,000
You run from me, you cocksucker?

435
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:02,365
Where's my fucking money?

436
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,900
I'll get it. I'll get it. My neck, Tony.

437
00:34:04,935 --> 00:34:07,667
- What? Do you think I'm an asshole?
- No.

438
00:34:07,702 --> 00:34:10,400
- I can't hear you.
- No, no. Please, Tony.

439
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You got 24 hours.

440
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,300
I called 911. They're on their way.
He's all right.

441
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,400
Oh, my God.

442
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,000
- Oh, my baby.
- Take her upstairs, Andy.

443
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,265
My baby...

444
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,700
She should take one of those
tranquillizers her mother gave her.

445
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,400
- We should go.
- Relax, we just got here.

446
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,700
Chicken's nice and spicy, huh?

447
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,100
I know you're in there.
You're casting a shadow over the peephole.

448
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
What? Are you ducking me?

449
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,000
I thought you were this girl.
She's a pain in the ass.

450
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,965
What the fuck? Where you been?

451
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,365
Working, man. I got those TV pitch meetings.

452
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,400
- I was gonna call you.
- Yeah, so why didn't you?

453
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,700
All right, look. You want the truth?
I was away. I went to AC.

454
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,400
- Where's my money?
- I don't have it yet.

455
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:48,900
But you went to AC.

456
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,300
I have a meeting next week with Rene Balcer.

457
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:59,500
Dick Wolf's right-hand guy. He likes my stuff.
He told my agent. I'm gonna be on staff.

458
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:03,167
I got out of that business
cos people fuck you over.

459
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,701
Jon Favreau?
Faggot cocksucker tried to steal my ideas.

460
00:36:06,736 --> 00:36:10,165
I swear on all that's holy.
I'll have your money next week.

461
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,200
That wasn't the deal! I'll be back tomorrow.
Don't make me a jerkoff.

462
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,100
Damn, I'm happy. Get a load of these.

463
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,200
My new kicks. Bottega Veneta,
marked down to only 600.

464
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,200
- Thought you were paying your phone bill.
- Oh, I should've, I know.

465
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:37,500
But it's been so long
since I've been able to treat myself.

466
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,900
Oh, thanks.

467
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,400
So, turns out my Uncle Zio's going downhill.

468
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,900
The day we met, I told you we were at the
cemetery to bury his wife, my Aunt Concetta.

469
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,700
70 years, they were together.

470
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
Poor guy's taking it very hard.

471
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,600
Oh! My knight in shining armour!

472
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,100
So?

473
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
- Good morning to you, too.
- You got it?

474
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,300
Jesus, you are a fucking trip.

475
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:32,300
I'm JT by the way.

476
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,200
What is this? Pulp Fiction?
Am I supposed to be afraid?

477
00:37:36,235 --> 00:37:37,900
I don't know. I didn't see it.

478
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You're really being a prick.
I told you, I need more time.

479
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,965
- I don't have the money.
- Get it.

480
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,700
You know me. What could you do to me
that I haven't already been through?

481
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,400
I'm positive we'll think of something.

482
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,900
And 66 years after taking those sacred vows,
"till death do us part",

483
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,400
Concetta left him and went home to God.

484
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,600
In the two weeks that followed,
Nicolo struggled without her,

485
00:38:18,635 --> 00:38:21,200
finally succumbing to irredeemable loss.

486
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,200
The enormity of his grief

487
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,565
can hardly be imagined.

488
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,100
How much they went through together -

489
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:35,165
seeing their children grow

490
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,200
and looking joyfully on
as their grandchildren had children.

491
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,200
Sickness and health,

492
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,265
good times and bad

493
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,400
but through it all, one thing remained constant.

494
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,900
They had each other.

495
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,400
It was Nicolo's love for Concetta
that made him leave this earth

496
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:58,700
a mere 15 days after she left him.

497
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,100
We take comfort
knowing they're together again,

498
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
seated at the foot of our Lord.

499
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Let us join together in prayer.

500
00:39:08,635 --> 00:39:10,917
Hail, Mary, full of Grace,

501
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:13,200
the Lord is with Thee.

502
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,265
Blessed art Thou among women

503
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,500
and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus.

504
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,200
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

505
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,100
pray for us sinners,

506
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,100
now and at the hour of our death, amen.

507
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,000
- Junior, what's the matter?
- Oh, this fucking shit!

508
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:34,000
What's the point?

509
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,700
- Shh, Uncle Junior.
- I can't take it any more!

510
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,200
You need to lower your voice. Come on.

511
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,000
And forgive us our trespasses

512
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,000
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

513
00:39:49,035 --> 00:39:51,267
It's a fucking Emmy.

514
00:39:51,302 --> 00:39:53,500
It's gold-plated.

515
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,900
Then melt it down, man.

516
00:39:56,935 --> 00:39:59,167
Look, I told you $15.

517
00:39:59,202 --> 00:40:01,365
Fuck, man, come on!

518
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,900
This is like, huge, this shit.

519
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,600
If you had an Oscar,
maybe I could give you something.

520
00:40:07,635 --> 00:40:09,800
An Academy Award. But TV?

521
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,900
- What else you got?
- I don't know.

522
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,800
I got a laptop in my car.

523
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,500
Yeah, OK, cool. I'll check that out.

524
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,200
From your friend. All 1200.

525
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,600
- He gave you a hard time?
- Hardest thing was keeping him awake.

526
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,200
- He's hitting the vein. Nodding out.
- Son of a fucking bitch.

527
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Cheers.

528
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,700
I'm grilling us some filet mignon.

529
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,400
And you, take a load off.

530
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,500
This is the money
from the closing of the racetrack.

531
00:41:14,535 --> 00:41:16,800
- It's 150 grand.
- That's great.

532
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,400
- How's your pal, Hesh?
- Good.

533
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,700
I remember once,
your dad and I drove down the shore.

534
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,300
Hesh had rented a place at Point Pleasant.
It was right before Labor Day.

535
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,800
Actually, it was a couple of months
before he died. We stopped at a liquor store.

536
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:37,265
He had to pee, I needed some cigarettes.

537
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,500
And anyway,
the man behind the counter was blind.

538
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,600
- Your dad looks at him...
- Wait a minute.

539
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,565
- This is after my dad got sick?
- Yeah.

540
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,900
My dad caught emphysema
and you kept smoking?

541
00:41:51,935 --> 00:41:55,165
- He didn't mind.
- He could barely breathe.

542
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,500
We had the oxygen tent set up right
in the house. Jesus, even my mother quit.

543
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,600
I offered to stop. He didn't want me to.
He was fine with it, really.

544
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,265
All right, whatever. Finish your story.

545
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,400
It was dumb. Your dad got the guy
to give us some champagne.

546
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,850
Water chestnuts

547
00:42:26,885 --> 00:42:29,000
wrapped in bacon.

548
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,200
And dip them in the duck sauce.

549
00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:34,200
All right.

550
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,200
Delicious.

551
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,100
So, what's in the bag?

552
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,600
Yeah, I wanted to show you this.

553
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's the hat I told you about.

554
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,200
- JFK's.
- Oh, my goodness.

555
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,400
Look at this.

556
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
- May I?
- Yeah

557
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,450
I met with the Dick Wolf guy.

558
00:44:03,485 --> 00:44:06,300
They hired some kid from Yale.

559
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,400
Plus, now the money I owe you

560
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,000
my ex-fucking-wife...

561
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,100
How many times have you shot up?

562
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,400
Five, six.

563
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,600
I thought I had it under control. I lost it.

564
00:44:22,635 --> 00:44:24,300
You stupid fuck.

565
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,400
- You were doing so good. Now you fucked up.
- Where do you get the right?

566
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,400
We're in the programme.
Why didn't you call your sponsor?

567
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,400
- I couldn't get him.
- So why didn't you call me?

568
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,300
Yeah, but I don't fucking live with my mistress.

569
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,800
I mean, his fucking slippers?

570
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,700
Go on.

571
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
Well, when I left there, I...

572
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,300
started thinking about it.

573
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,000
When I was, I don't know, 16 years old -

574
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,300
my son's age -

575
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,800
I came home from school
to find a note from my Aunt Quin.

576
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:19,800
My mother had been pregnant
with another kid after my sister Barbara.

577
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,700
Change-of-life baby, they called it and...

578
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,100
Well, she started bleeding.

579
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,900
I was supposed get my father
over there ASAP.

580
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,500
I called every number I had.
I left messages all over town.

581
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,900
And finally, that night, about ten o'clock,

582
00:45:42,935 --> 00:45:45,100
he called me back.

583
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,400
- Hello?
- Anthony, what's the matter?

584
00:45:53,435 --> 00:45:55,265
Ma's in the hospital.

585
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,800
I think she was bleeding. The baby.

586
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,300
Jesus Christ.

587
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,900
Oh, shit!

588
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,900
- OK, pal.
- The lamb chops are gonna be overcooked.

589
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,200
I'm tied up, but I'm gonna get over
to the hospital right away.

590
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,100
He came and got me the next morning.

591
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,400
We went over to the hospital,

592
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:27,965
walked into her room.

593
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,700
- You're OK, baby, you're OK.
- No, you're OK!

594
00:46:31,735 --> 00:46:34,700
Your life is just so wonderful and OK!

595
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
Lee...

596
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,900
Where were you last night?

597
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,700
I was at the Yankee game.

598
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,765
You were with that whore.

599
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,500
- What do you take me for? An idiot?
- No, Lee, that's not true!

600
00:46:52,535 --> 00:46:55,567
I picked up Anthony from school,
we went to the game!

601
00:46:55,602 --> 00:46:58,600
- Nicky gave us the tickets.
- You're a goddam liar.

602
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,765
I swear to God, Lee, the car broke down!

603
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,100
The timing belt!
We had to stay at Cousin Jimmy's.

604
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:11,400
Madonn', when we got home
and saw that note, I was worried sick.

605
00:47:11,435 --> 00:47:13,600
Ask Anthony, you don't believe me.

606
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Where were you last night, Anthony?

607
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,600
We were at Cousin Jimmy's, Ma.

608
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,200
She could've fucking died

609
00:47:34,235 --> 00:47:36,400
from a miscarriage.

610
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:54,000
- Fuck her.
- Was there any blame on his part?

611
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,000
This man you emulate?

612
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,800
The lies? The betrayals with other women?

613
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,200
Listen to me.

614
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:12,000
This is very important. Your mother
had her faults, but after all this time

615
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,600
what should we do with the old woman?

616
00:48:14,635 --> 00:48:16,867
Have an auto-da-fé?

617
00:48:16,902 --> 00:48:19,100
Burn her at the stake?

618
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,900
You need to forgive her and move on.

619
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,765
She made my father give my dog away.

620
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,100
I thought your father was a big, tough guy.

621
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,300
Probably didn't want to hear her bullshit
any more.

622
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,600
He gave my dog away
to his girlfriend's kid. Big deal.

623
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,100
If it was up to her,

624
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,600
she woulda had it killed.

625
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,700
All right, thanks.

626
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,500
Book value's 17 grand.
I'll knock that off the principal.

627
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,000
I fucking loved this car.

628
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,600
So you'll get another one.

629
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,800
Is that your sponsor?

630
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,000
I'll see you when you get out of rehab.
We'll figure out the rest of the payments.

631
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,800
You can do this, man. I have faith in you.

632
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,100
There's no chemical solution
to a spiritual problem.

633
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,000
It could've been another TIA. It's hard to tell.

634
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:09,600
Was any of this
accompanied by a lapse in memory?

635
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,665
I don't know.

636
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,600
Had you brought him earlier
I might have more answers.

637
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,250
That medicine stopped working.

638
00:50:19,285 --> 00:50:21,800
I took more and it didn't do shit.

639
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,600
- I'm the walking dead.
- Medication's like cooking.

640
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:27,000
We may need to adjust the ingredients.

641
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,200
Who gives a shit? I'm so fucking blue.

642
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:35,100
What do you expect?
All you do is go to funerals all the time.

643
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,400
I'm trapped. What's the goddamn point?

644
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,600
Goddamn house arrest.

645
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,900
My life is only death.

646
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,100
I'm living in a grave.

647
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,300
I beat prison and for what?

648
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,400
I have no children.

649
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,500
Would somebody please explain this?

650
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,100
So, Hesh tells me you met your dad's goomah.

651
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,200
You had to see this woman in her prime.

652
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,365
- Nice, huh?
- Nice?

653
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,965
- She was JFK's girlfriend for three years.
- No shit!

654
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,200
- I remember hearing about her.
- Fucking knockout. Beautiful, classy.

655
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,500
JFK, huh? How do you like that?

656
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,600
He had her up to the White House
on the weekends, when his wife was away.

657
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,100
This woman was like a... like a princess.

658
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,400
I'll tell you what.

659
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:05,000
For a while there, Jackie Kennedy
thought the marriage was over.

660
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,600
English
