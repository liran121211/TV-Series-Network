1
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,300
Fuck this! I'm calling Carlo.

2
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,050
Yeah, they didn't show.

3
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,200
The Vespa scooters.

4
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,200
We gotta wait.

5
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,000
Carlo was furious. His guys waited by
the Hackensack River all night.

6
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,000
fuckin' Vespas never got in my hands.

7
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,100
This is Port Newark.
Where were your longshoremen?

8
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:31,500
Heightened security at ports, al-Quaeda.

9
00:02:31,535 --> 00:02:34,800
- Done, Johnny.
- I gotta go.

10
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,300
Nice job, Billy boy.

11
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,700
Carlo was told it was a go. If it didn't
happen, why did nobody call?

12
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,500
A lotta things didn't happen
that seem like they happen...

13
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,200
Your cousin didn't whack Joey,
the Vespas never got into my hands.

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,265
Come on, go, Soph!

15
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,500
- Hey, Soph is open! Come on!
- Over here!

16
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,700
She's gotta be at least 11.

17
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,565
Don't put up with that, Lissie!

18
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,100
Careful with those elbows, number seven!

19
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,500
Hey, out of bounds! Out of bounds!

20
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:18,865
Oh, Lissie, go!

21
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,365
They're just a bunch of losers!

22
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,800
- No negatives, you!
- Come on, putz, charge the ball!

23
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:26,300
Charge it!

24
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,600
Foul! That kid tripped my kid!

25
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,600
Legal, she was going for the ball.

26
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,300
- She was not.
- Score!

27
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,500
- Score, come on!
- Your kid is outta control.

28
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:39,565
She's been tripping all summer.

29
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,400
- Shut up and get outta here.
- Don't tell me to shut up!

30
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,700
What, are you crazy?

31
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,300
Please. Come on! Somebody!

32
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,500
How do you like it now, bitch?

33
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,500
Her kid kicked my kid. Get off!

34
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,300
- Cost ya 100.
- Call.

35
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,900
Sit down. Sit, sit.

36
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,300
I talked to John.

37
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
The Vespa scooters came in, but there was
no opportunity to grab them

38
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,965
because of increased security at the ports.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,700
Jesus Christ! The young crowd is crazy
for these scooters.

40
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:27,465
- He owes me half that load.
- You're not buying it?

41
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,250
I don't know what to think.
He's getting cute with his remarks.

42
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:35,000
All I know is his behaviour
at that kid's funeral was a disgrace.

43
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:37,365
It's a big part of my livelihood, that port.

44
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,400
I will say, very interesting timing, T.
You and John had that chat at the funeral...

45
00:04:42,435 --> 00:04:44,317
whatever that was...

46
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:46,200
suddenly, no Vespas.

47
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,400
All right, I gotta take this.

48
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,000
Take one of Carlo's guys,
start hanging around Port Newark.

49
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,400
Find out what the fuck is going on.

50
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,400
- The property taxes, I know.
- Hello to you too.

51
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,165
Your sister Janice got arrested.

52
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,850
- What?
- In Essex County this afternoon,

53
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:13,465
an incident of sports rage
among soccer moms

54
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,100
led to the arrest of a Verona woman
with ties to the Mafia.

55
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:19,300
Our Gillian Glessner was on the scene.

56
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,600
Think that other mother better go
into the soccer-mom protection programme?

57
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:26,900
Maybe she should, Carl.
It started here at Summit Avenue Park

58
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:29,600
during a nine-and ten-year-olds'
soccer match.

59
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,600
An altercation between soccer moms sent
one mother to the hospital and one to jail.

60
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,500
Denise McCarthy, a parent,
witnessed the violence.

61
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:39,065
I just feel so bad for the kids.

62
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,500
Parents taping the match
captured the mêlée.

63
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:44,665
Somebodyl

64
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,600
How do you like it now, bitch?

65
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,000
Her kid kicked my kidl

66
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,600
Charges are pending, but we know...

67
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,500
that the woman shown here being taken
into custody is Janice Baccalieri,

68
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,000
sister of reputed New Jersey mob boss
Anthony Soprano.

69
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,700
Guess you could call it a Mafia-related hit.

70
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,600
We spoke with psychologist Bela Kakuk.

71
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,965
It's a growing problem in our society.

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Psychologists are finding
that certain individuals

73
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:13,765
are particularly prone to rage.

74
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,565
Almost any frustration, inconvenience

75
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,900
or perceived inconsideration
will set them off.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,300
Motherfucker!

77
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,200
Janice, open the door!

78
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,300
- Where is she?
- It wasn't my fault!

79
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,900
My name was all over the fuckin' TV
because of your bullshit!

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,400
It's not that simple.
The woman's kid was picking on Sophia.

81
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:44,067
- Why didn't they collar her?
- I am suing the township

82
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:47,665
- for wrongful arrest and the YSO.
- No. No, you're not!

83
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,300
What you're gonna do is call Neil Mink,
play it down, pay the fine

84
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,000
and not turn this into
one of your causes célèbres.

85
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,900
Anybody's side but mine.
That bitch is lucky I didn't kill her.

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,100
- Well, we know that.
- What?

87
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,300
- You and your fuckin' temper.
- Get out!

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is the end of it.

89
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,900
Get out!

90
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,500
I know this looks bad.

91
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,500
On the other hand,
she called Sophia her daughter.

92
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,900
I don't give a fuck.

93
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,165
All right, I do give a fuck.

94
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,700
But how many times I gotta tell you?
Get control of your wife!

95
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,765
I'm so embarrassed.

96
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't wanna see any of my friends again.

97
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,500
Well, when you're a parent, you'll see.

98
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,500
You'll defend your children
like a lion with her cubs.

99
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:09,400
- You're not my parent.
- What did you say?

100
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,365
I'm here...

101
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,400
and I try to care very much.

102
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,700
- Now get to sleep.
- You gonna punch me?

103
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,900
Jan, can I talk to you?

104
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,200
Go to sleep.

105
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,200
We'll talk tomorrow. I'm exhausted.

106
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,800
No. Now.

107
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,800
What, I don't have a say in things?

108
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,065
Janice, I think you need professional help.

109
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,600
I'll be having an extra session
with Sandy, believe me.

110
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,700
What does she do? Tells you
you were picked on by your father

111
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,850
and asks you to read her screenplays.

112
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,900
I think there's anger specialists.

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,300
You should see a weight-loss specialist.

114
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,465
You don't see it in yourself.
I heard you with Sophia.

115
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,800
You were getting along so much better,
she says one little thing and you get nasty.

116
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:15,400
- I'm so sore.
- This is not an isolated incident.

117
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,350
They won't let you shop
up at the corner anymore.

118
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:21,200
Those coffee beans were burnt.
You tasted them.

119
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:23,465
Janice, I like a spitfire type,

120
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,500
I told you,
but we can't live like this, me and the kids.

121
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,865
Like what?

122
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,400
This was a nice house.

123
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,300
Peaceful... I don't know.
There wasn't all this yelling and tension.

124
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,400
How could you understand?

125
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,450
Your dad was a sweetheart,

126
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:43,292
even when he had emphysema.

127
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:46,100
My house... it was dog eat dog.

128
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,300
Well, be that as it may, the past and all,

129
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,900
if you don't go to these anger classes
they have or whatever,

130
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,400
this with us ain't gonna work out.

131
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,600
Gentlemen, it's rollin'. It's nine. Place nine.

132
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
What do you think he clears here?

133
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,800
Two craps tables, blackjack, roulette.

134
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,700
You gotta figure he's
grabbing anywhere from 2,500

135
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,400
to five Gs a night for himself.

136
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,700
It used to be you, didn't it?

137
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,500
Teacher's pet?

138
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,300
- Stop making meatballs, Paulie.
- I'm just saying.

139
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,700
Now you know what I went through.

140
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,600
It's the same Gina had at her wedding.

141
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:47,800
We should see how it looks on your face.

142
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
What the fuck?

143
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,665
- What's up?
- Hey there, cuz.

144
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,100
- Guess who called me.
- How'd you find me?

145
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:14,365
- You're not gonna guess?
- OK, who?

146
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,900
- Our friend with the orchard.
- No shit. He OK?

147
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:20,467
Yeah, sold the place, moving to Florida.

148
00:11:20,502 --> 00:11:23,000
He should, he's getting on in years.

149
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,365
Oh, shit.

150
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,500
You still got your canned peaches there.

151
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,300
I just had the car serviced.
Watch what ya say.

152
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,500
I gotta move that shit? Again?

153
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,300
That developer's going up there.

154
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,100
Obviously, it wouldn't be good
for you or our friend

155
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,000
if somebody opened the canned fruit.

156
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,650
So you and your cousin here
will take care of it.

157
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:47,165
- I'll do it.
- I'm worried about the old guy.

158
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,900
- I told ya, I'll do it.
- My old man's got a few jars up there also.

159
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:53,700
Could make problems for my uncle.

160
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,600
It's gonna be a lotta work,

161
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,000
which with Louise around
can only be done at night.

162
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,900
- That's true.
- Thing's gotta be done in two weeks.

163
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:04,700
Bulldozers are coming.

164
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,565
- Are you picking out wedding cakes?
- Yeah.

165
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,465
- Hope you have better luck than I did.
- You didn't like your cake?

166
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,000
I think your luck's been fuckin' great,
and listen to you cursing it out.

167
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,200
What, you got something you wanna say?

168
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,100
- All right.
- So call me.

169
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,400
Who is this Uncle Pat anyway?

170
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,865
He was a knock-around guy like Tony's dad,

171
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,200
but they let him retire to this farm
upstate New York.

172
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,500
It sounds funny, but it wasn't.
He had the hiccups for like a year.

173
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:49,200
Jeez.

174
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,100
Great guy. He had a daughter,
but she lived with her mom.

175
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,300
Us boys each got sent up there summers
when we hit up 12 or 13.

176
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,265
He'd school us.

177
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,200
- Did he have the hiccups?
- I told ya that went away.

178
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,965
You think it's fuckin' funny?

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,300
He almost committed suicide because of it.

180
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,165
How would you like it?

181
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,300
Where's my Barney's underpants
with ventilated cotton?

182
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,700
Still in the dryer.

183
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,965
Tell ya one thing,

184
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,900
I need fuckin' Tony B
up there like I need a third nut.

185
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,700
All this resentment.

186
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,465
- He is your cousin.
- Yeah?

187
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,800
Should've seen him when I was little...
him and Tony both.

188
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:36,200
How they broke my balls, teased me.

189
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,700
One time, I was spending the summer
up at Uncle Pat's farm

190
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,965
just like they used to - I was 11.

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,200
They came up -
they were like 19- to shoot guns.

192
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,300
They didn't take me with 'em,
and when I found 'em,

193
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:52,265
they said I had to be initiated
into a special club

194
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,400
by being tied to a tree
alone in the orchard for an hour.

195
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,800
I was on that tree
till three in the fuckin' morning.

196
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,300
I worshipped these two guys...
Tony Soprano especially.

197
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,065
When he was by himself,

198
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,900
he used to push me on my Big Wheels,

199
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:11,867
he'd teach me curse words.

200
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:13,800
When he was by himself.

201
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Where's the Tinactin?

202
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,600
Right on the night table.

203
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,300
And here we are again. Tony B goes wrong,

204
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,400
and Tony lays a 200K-a-year
cash cow on him.

205
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,200
Christopher, don't get mad, OK?

206
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,500
I know we kinda touched on it
a couple times,

207
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,250
but you're so unhappy.

208
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,865
What if we left here,

209
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,900
went far away,
and you went into something else?

210
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:54,800
- Like what?
- I don't know, like...

211
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,800
Pick up your writing maybe?

212
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,500
Male modelling...

213
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,250
I'll get back to the writing some day,

214
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,600
but from a position of great wealth.

215
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,000
As far as male modelling,
I'd probably be a success,

216
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,500
but I wouldn't want to be
around those people.

217
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,300
I'm a soldier, Adriana.
When are you gonna understand that?

218
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,200
What the fuck?

219
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,465
- Carmela.
- What?

220
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,200
There's no water in the pool.

221
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:39,400
Yeah, I had it drained.

222
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,900
The electricity costs a fortune.

223
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:44,300
You're the only one who uses it.

224
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,600
We were getting along better.

225
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,700
So, you polluted all the decent lawyers in
New Jersey so they can't represent me?

226
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,465
- You couldn't play fair.
- I didn't want it!

227
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,600
Let's just pretend that
you weren't begging for it

228
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,600
in a million different ways, OK,

229
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,100
because I am worn out here.

230
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,400
He's a nice kid, Finn, right?

231
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Right.

232
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,700
We gonna throw 'em
an engagement party or what?

233
00:16:56,735 --> 00:16:58,800
If we can be civil.

234
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,300
She's so young.

235
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,900
Same age we were.

236
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,800
It wasn't all bad.

237
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,300
Last time, I asked you to jot down
one or two situations

238
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
or people that trigger your anger,

239
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:26,200
so when you think about it,

240
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,500
you get angry all over again - anybody?

241
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,000
Let's give Bradley a chance this time.

242
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,800
My partner parked me in again.
I couldn't find the keys.

243
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:39,300
I had to wake him up
and he starts yelling at me.

244
00:17:39,335 --> 00:17:41,000
Describe the feelings.

245
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,800
My stepkids do that all the time.

246
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,050
They leave their bikes in the garage

247
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:48,200
and if I wanna pull in, I gotta get out

248
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,665
and move the bikes
with a car full of groceries.

249
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,500
Doris, can't you keep Billy's bike
out of the driveway?!

250
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,300
It's a famous commercial from the '60s.
Bufferin.

251
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:03,300
Guy has a headache
and he takes it out on his wife.

252
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,265
Back to Bradley,

253
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm trying to get
into his physical sensations of anger.

254
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,465
He saw red. Who wouldn't?

255
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,365
She's right. Why is he in here?

256
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,000
Why isn't his roommate in therapy
for selfishness issues?

257
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,100
There are always things
that are irritating and out of our control.

258
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:25,100
What we can control
is our response to those triggers.

259
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,700
So people get a free pass...
the whole world?

260
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:29,817
I told you about my supervisor...

261
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:31,900
checking my work and nobody else's?

262
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,100
- I wonder why.
- Cos you're a minority.

263
00:18:34,135 --> 00:18:36,700
Exactly. That's why I'm in here.

264
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,500
- You seem angry about Evelyn's problem.
- It makes me mad.

265
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,865
It doesn't make you mad.
You make you mad.

266
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,865
I come from a biased family,
but I was different.

267
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,100
I put all my faith and my hopes
into the civil rights movement.

268
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,300
I left home and I marched.

269
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,865
And for what?
So they could ride around in their SUVs,

270
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,000
blasting that rap shit and you can't say
anything because they might have guns?

271
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,265
Wait a fuckin' minute. Who's they?

272
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,900
- If the shoe fits.
- This is fuckin' priceless.

273
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,850
OK, let's not time-travel here,

274
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:10,665
let's try to stay in the present.

275
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,450
Janice, you're angry. Let's stay with that.

276
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,200
What are your physical feelings right now?

277
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,865
I'd like to punch you in the face.

278
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,900
Your hands are clenched.
Did you realise that?

279
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,465
You're provoking me to make a point.

280
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
- Maybe that's your job but I don't like it.
- Look at you.

281
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:31,617
- You're not even listening.
- He's talking to me.

282
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:34,626
No. You and me, we do most
of the talking in here.

283
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:37,600
The man is trying to say
that those people outside...

284
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,265
they do the thing,

285
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,300
but we're the ones that get
all upset and start carrying on.

286
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
That's all he's saying.

287
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,200
The Hudson Valley.

288
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,800
That Legend of Sleepy Hollow cartoon
scared the piss outta me when I was a kid.

289
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,300
Would you mind watching your shoe?

290
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:03,600
Oh, sure.

291
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,400
It's a $50,000 vehicle.
I don't want it scuffed up.

292
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,065
Uncle Pat's farm?

293
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,800
When you're 12, 13, man,
it's like fuckin' heaven, right?

294
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,900
Running around in the woods,
driving that tractor.

295
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,900
He made me clear the brush by the fence
with a fuckin' scythe, though.

296
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,100
I had to do that. Tony too.

297
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,500
And water his fuckin'
tomatoes and his basinigol'.

298
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,150
Changed, though, you know, Pat's,

299
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:45,665
after Louise came back there to live.

300
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,500
It wasn't just you and Pat
and his great stories.

301
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,500
They used to call me Ichabod Crane.

302
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,800
- Who?
- Some very sorry people, that's who.

303
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,600
The Carmela front? Did you two ever
discuss that evening you made love?

304
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,600
It was a one-time deal. I've moved on.

305
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,200
What about the depression?

306
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,900
Your revelation
about your cousin, his prison sentence?

307
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:29,800
You were very upset.

308
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,100
Tell you the truth, I haven't had
a lot of time to think about that.

309
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,100
My sister...

310
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,200
She attacked some woman
at her stepkid's soccer game.

311
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,665
You've mentioned her temper before.

312
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,500
She got charged with aggravated assault
and resisting arrest.

313
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:51,800
Excellent.

314
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,500
Let's talk about that.

315
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,000
- What?
- Rage.

316
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,300
- Why?
- Depression is rage turned inward.

317
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,350
Tell me about the Soprano temper.

318
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:06,465
The thing is, it's bad for business.

319
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,300
Clouds your judgment.
John, he always had a terrible temper.

320
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,100
- John?
- Gotti.

321
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,965
And in the end, I think it hurt him.

322
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,300
See, we forget that in the old days, the ones
that came over, that started this thing,

323
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,365
they didn't get mad.

324
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,700
They just smiled and nodded
and made sure you got it later.

325
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,665
That's the whole beautiful point.

326
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,000
You know what they say.
Revenge is like serving cold cuts.

327
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,450
I think it's, "Revenge is a dish
best served cold. "

328
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:38,865
- So, what'd I say?
- But why revenge all the time?

329
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,200
Where does it come from, this insatiable
anger you and your sister share?

330
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:46,600
I was wondering when she'd come up?

331
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,665
Your mother? What about your father?

332
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,100
You never saw her
chop off someone's finger.

333
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:56,500
- Told you about that, didn't I?
- Yes.

334
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,850
- Jesus, I wish I hadn't.
- Why?

335
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:03,100
I dress up nice when I come here...

336
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,600
OK, let's stick to the subject.

337
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,100
- Which is what?
- Your own intolerance for frustration.

338
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,900
"Thank you for holding.
Your call is important to us. "

339
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:19,465
If it's so important to you, answer the phone!

340
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,300
- Stay with that.
- It's just a level of bullshit!

341
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,900
Every fuckin' new idea they come up with
to make things better makes things worse.

342
00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:32,300
OK, right, I agree.
"The centre cannot hold.

343
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,650
"The falcon cannot hear the falconer. "

344
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:36,865
What the fuck are you talking about?

345
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,100
We live in a time
of technological and spiritual crisis,

346
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:43,200
but you feel you're above all of it,

347
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,500
certainly above any
inconvenience or annoyance.

348
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:49,800
And if things don't go your way,

349
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,900
instead of being merely disappointed
or inconvenienced, you blow.

350
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,200
My sister's...

351
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,100
She's taking anger-management classes.

352
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,165
Maybe she's on the right track.

353
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,700
- Is this something you'd consider?
- No.

354
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,500
But I'll admit it's not good for me,
all this fuckin' agitation.

355
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,300
Wears me out.
I'm fuckin' exhausted all the time.

356
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,200
- Where did we start off?
- I don't know.

357
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,500
Depression is rage turned inward.

358
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,900
This is nice.

359
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,650
For inner-city kids like me,
this was important.

360
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:53,665
You lived next
to the largest mall in New Jersey.

361
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,765
It's over now. She's sticking me
in that home in Florida.

362
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,300
- That's the last I'll ever see of her.
- I'll be right down the road.

363
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:02,065
I got a beautiful condo.

364
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,900
Thinks she's gonna meet
some old, lonely widower.

365
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,700
Louise, it's time for dessert.

366
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,400
I'm getting it.

367
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,700
And do me a favour, be as polite as
you are when it's just the two of us?

368
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,400
We know where Chrissy buried the guy.

369
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,800
But with Uncle Johnny's,
you gotta help us out.

370
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,750
I'm not exactly sure,
but there was two of them.

371
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:46,000
- The Johnson brothers.
- You don't remember where?

372
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,600
It was a long time ago.

373
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,300
We can't excavate the whole fuckin' place.

374
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,700
Cos you know
what Tony's gonna say?

375
00:25:56,735 --> 00:25:59,000
Let him come up here and dig then.

376
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,500
Please. He's a heart attack waiting
to happen.

377
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:06,200
That's no joke. Our bodies are 86% water.

378
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,800
His last blood test, he was 65% zeppole.

379
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,100
When he first heard the term "pie in the
sky," he volunteered for the 82nd Airborne.

380
00:26:19,135 --> 00:26:20,600
That's pretty good.

381
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,900
I learned in recovery that he's just tamping
down his feelings by eating.

382
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,165
I should talk to him. It's a shame, you know.

383
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,400
- He was the funnest guy in the world.
- When was that?

384
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,900
He's got the world by the balls and he acts
like everything's an imposition.

385
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,900
Being at the top, he's isolated himself.

386
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,300
Yeah, it's just him and his money.

387
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
Hello.

388
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,300
- Who is this guy, anyway?
- My first. Czechoslovakian guy.

389
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,000
This is the second time I'm moving him.

390
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,700
- Come here, you little fuck.
- Guys, wait.

391
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,700
- Come here, you little fuck.
- It wasn't me...

392
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,200
- Help! Please, don't kill me.
- What the fuck you running for?

393
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,000
The night of the 12th, there was a ship from
Italy with these containers of Vespas.

394
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,300
I don't know anything about any Vespas!

395
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,000
We know they got here.
What happened to them?

396
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,800
I don't know. I wasn't here!

397
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,400
Well, apparently he says he wasn't here.

398
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,700
Who picked up
our motherfuckin', cocksucking Vespas?

399
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,765
In two seconds, this is going up your ass.

400
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,500
It was the guys from New York.
Phil Leotardo and them.

401
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,900
Listen.

402
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,100
Thanks for doing this. You didn't have to.

403
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,200
Fuck that. You're my little cousin.

404
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,300
I think I can imagine what you may
be hearing about me

405
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,300
and what happened in New York.

406
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,600
All I can say is, there's no truth to it.

407
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,800
I didn't think nothing.

408
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,500
And Tony putting me in at the casino,
I knew people would resent that.

409
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,500
But I went away for a long time,
stood up for this family,

410
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:13,300
and you, or anybody,
can think what they like,

411
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,400
but I feel I had a little coming to me.

412
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,400
Absolutely. I was telling Benny that
the other day. He was complaining.

413
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,300
And what I said about Tony before?

414
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,400
- You know I love him like a brother.
- I love him, too.

415
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,800
We saw the guy down the pier.
John has the Vespas.

416
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,600
To think of how supportive you were of him.
That whole Little Carmine fiasco.

417
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,265
It's fuckin' payback.

418
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,800
Johnny's got it in his head my cousin
had something to do with Joey.

419
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:25,900
Johnny should be looking for the real killers

420
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
instead of spending
all his time on that golf course.

421
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,500
Whole fuckin' shipment
of cheese coming in next month.

422
00:30:34,535 --> 00:30:36,565
The imported provolone.

423
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,800
I guess we can kiss that goodbye too now,
right?

424
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,300
Motherfucker!

425
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,900
- What are you doing here?
- My son is a senior here now.

426
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:14,100
We were electing party
chairs for a senior night.

427
00:31:14,135 --> 00:31:15,500
Right.

428
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,700
- So, how are you?
- Fine.

429
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Cos you were pretty
upset when you left and I wanted to call.

430
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,565
I began to really rue what happened...

431
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,600
- I'm going back with my husband.
- Oh, that's good.

432
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,600
All the best.

433
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,700
You don't drink no more?

434
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,300
Clean and sober, 14 months.

435
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,100
Yeah, your mother has that problem.

436
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,700
Good for you.

437
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,100
- That's right.
- What?

438
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,800
The Johnson brothers' bodies.

439
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,000
I know where they are.

440
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,865
Over by the fence in the northwest corner,

441
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,365
because that night
I noticed one of my pickers

442
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,265
had stuck a Swiss Colony bottle
upside-down on one of the fenceposts.

443
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,200
And I was plenty goddamn mad they were
drinking on the job, I'll tell you.

444
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,500
It's still there, the glass bottle.

445
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,700
- Are you fuckin' sure?
- Lunch!

446
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,200
- I got for you, Chrissy.
- Thank you.

447
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Sandwich?

448
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,300
Beautiful.

449
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,200
This is mail from three fuckin' weeks ago.

450
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,000
- The girl didn't even show up today.
- Why don't you get somebody new?

451
00:33:09,035 --> 00:33:12,067
Two classes, she's telling
people how to run their life.

452
00:33:12,102 --> 00:33:15,100
Don't let me stop you
from taking your kids to the rink.

453
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,100
You have every right
to be mad at me, and I apologise.

454
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,600
I know it's bad for the family...
for business... but I'm working on it.

455
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,400
Yeah, I know. Bobby told me.

456
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,500
- So how's that going?
- Anger management?

457
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,000
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

458
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,600
It's such a relief to let go
of all that shit and...

459
00:33:55,635 --> 00:33:58,300
I never realised what
an angry person I was

460
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,265
and how it fed itself.

461
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,800
- So they got you on tranquillisers?
- No.

462
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,100
Basically, it's taking responsibility
for your anger,

463
00:34:09,135 --> 00:34:12,665
and learning to recognise
your feelings of anger

464
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,700
and that they're just feelings,
you don't have to act on them.

465
00:34:16,735 --> 00:34:19,300
People want that
so they can walk all over you.

466
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,900
A lot of anger is self-importance.

467
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,550
- Self-importance?
- Problems with authority.

468
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:29,065
Dr Seepman locks the door
promptly at seven.

469
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:34,100
People wig out if they don't get in, start
banging on the door. It's a big lesson.

470
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,765
I was making everybody
in my life miserable,

471
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,900
yelling and screaming,
or pouting and feeling victimised,

472
00:34:42,935 --> 00:34:46,617
but I feel so much better
now about everything.

473
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:50,300
It's like this great sadness
is beginning to lift.

474
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,800
- Sadness?
- Yeah.

475
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,600
- Well, I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

476
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,600
I am.

477
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,400
Your bid, Chrissy.

478
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,200
You expecting someone?

479
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,300
There he is!

480
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,800
My God, I don't believe it.

481
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:44,300
Who's that... Anthony?

482
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,000
What's the matter? You all right?

483
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,500
God, you're big.

484
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,000
Look at those shoulders.

485
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,765
- Jan sends her love and Barb, too.
- Did you eat?

486
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,100
Louise, don't ask him. He's a guest.
Just go get him a plate!

487
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,465
Sit down.

488
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,100
- You look good.
- Feel good.

489
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,100
So how we doing?

490
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,200
Took care of mine last night.
The Johnson brothers we'll get tonight.

491
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,500
Uncle Pat was like Johnny Mnemonic.
Right, Uncle Pat?

492
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,800
We're playing pinochle.
Take a hand.

493
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,900
- This is the life, huh?
- I'm with you.

494
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:40,800
Yeah, we were just saying that.

495
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,500
To a job well done.

496
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,465
This place hasn't changed much.

497
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,700
Met some pretty nice college girls
the other night.

498
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:40,900
She liked you, Miss Raven-Hair?

499
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,300
Pat seems good, huh?

500
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,400
Louise seems fat.

501
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,065
The human body is 86% water,

502
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,100
but Louise's last blood test,
she was 65% zeppole.

503
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,800
That's a good one.

504
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,265
I knew a guy, when he was gonna eat
Philly cheese steak,

505
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,300
the mayor of Philly would have
to call out the National Guard.

506
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,200
What the fuck's so funny about that?
Doesn't even make sense.

507
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,050
- Well, he's drunk.
- Him?

508
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:28,500
No way. He's in recovery.

509
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,200
If you recover
your fuckin' balls, give us a call.

510
00:38:33,235 --> 00:38:35,300
We might like to hang out.

511
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,300
No, seriously, it's not funny.

512
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,865
He's a 12-stepper, right?

513
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,300
Well, yeah. You know that. That's right.

514
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,100
Maybe he can take another couple of steps
out the door so we could have some fun?

515
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,500
Come on, don't get pissy now.
He's just having a joke, that's all.

516
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,500
Sobriety's hard enough
without having to get mocked for it.

517
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:01,100
Jesus Christ,
why don't you have a fuckin' drink?

518
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,850
You're driving
everybody crazy with this shit.

519
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:06,500
The fuckin' Higher Power
yammering and the sweets

520
00:39:06,535 --> 00:39:09,400
and the Key lime pie and the... Jesus.

521
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,700
Order a fuckin' bullshot,
will you? Do me a favour.

522
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:28,700
I'm sorry, I didn't realise
I was being a jerkoff.

523
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Look, it's just... you know, come on.

524
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,300
You're doing the right thing.

525
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,265
So, how do you like his car?

526
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,700
Schwarzenegger's. Pretty great, huh?

527
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:52,865
The humvee. Yeah, it's nice.

528
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,500
- Kinda steep.
- You told me you didn't pay for it.

529
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,100
- You gave the guy a hum-job.
- For the hum-vee.

530
00:39:59,135 --> 00:40:01,465
Maybe he'd like to hum me.

531
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,300
- A friend of Bill over here?
- Fuckin' wits over here.

532
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,800
Bill? I'll say.

533
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,700
That? That's not a bill, that's a beak.

534
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,600
You know...

535
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,400
that was you he made
that joke about, the zeppole content.

536
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,150
On the way home,
we can drop him off at Beakskill.

537
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:25,100
Well, if beaks could kill,
that one certainly would.

538
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,600
I could've called you
Ichabod Crane, but I didn't.

539
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,200
What the fuck's he talking about...
Ichabod Crane?

540
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,900
Nothin'.

541
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,200
Here's to the Johnson brothers,
whoever the fuck they were.

542
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,300
...Port Newark...

543
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,865
...but one example.

544
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,365
Six million containers
enter U.S. ports every year,

545
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,400
yet fewer than two per cent of them
are opened and inspected by U.S. Customs.

546
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,200
It is impossible to check every container

547
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,000
without essentially stopping
global commerce.

548
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:30,667
But what keeps officials
from sleeping at night

549
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:33,300
is that terrorists could use
shipping containers

550
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,665
to smuggle in a weapon
of mass destruction.

551
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,850
It is within the capabilities
of Islamic fundamentalists

552
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:42,965
to track a container
with a Global Positioning System

553
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,800
and detonate a nuclear
or biological weapon hidden inside.

554
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,300
Son of a bitch.

555
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,100
A terrorist could use a shipping container
to smuggle himself into the country.

556
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,500
There he is.

557
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,900
What I saw on TV last night.
The ports are wide open.

558
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:07,065
Government's not doing shit.

559
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,900
- Where's my butter substitute?
- In front of you.

560
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:12,665
Didn't you hear what I said?
I knew it was bad.

561
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,800
Seven million containers. The news team
put radioactive shit in one of 'em.

562
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:19,900
- It wasn't even detected.
- Please, my ears.

563
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,265
Sit down. Sit.

564
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,500
Come on. I made eggs.

565
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,900
Could've been a goddamn A-bomb.

566
00:42:28,935 --> 00:42:30,900
- You want coffee?
- Yeah.

567
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,265
Fuckin' terrible nightmares.

568
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,700
Yeah, it knocked the edge
right the hell off your appetite.

569
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,200
- What's the matter with you?
- No, it is some scary shit.

570
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,100
Not my problem much longer.

571
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,000
Speaking of scary shit,
was that you in the bathroom?

572
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,400
Oh, yeah. I thought they already dropped
the biological weapon.

573
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,500
All right, I gotta go.

574
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,065
I thought we were gonna go hunting.

575
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,500
- You hear the turkeys this morning?
- No, I gotta take off.

576
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,865
Uncle Pat. Take care of yourself.

577
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,900
- Be careful of the alligators down there.
- All right, tough guy.

578
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,600
Hey, Tone! What'd you do,
knock over a roadside stand?

579
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,300
My uncle's farm.
Less than 100 miles from here.

580
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,900
It's like a whole different world.

581
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,100
The bullshit really falls away up there.

582
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,300
Hear about that shit with the ports?

583
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,500
Customs agents are bad for us, but
antiterrorism-wise, they're doing nothing.

584
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,665
What's it gonna take,
a fuckin' nuclear bomb?

585
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,800
They caught one al-Quaeda cocksucker
in one container.

586
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,600
- They caught him.
- There's enough they don't catch.

587
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,400
The administration's busy too,

588
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,500
giving noncompetitive
building contracts to friends.

589
00:44:37,535 --> 00:44:40,900
Hell, we can all understand that.

590
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,865
We're sitting ducks here.

591
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,500
Only thing between our homes
and Port Newark is a chain-link fence.

592
00:44:47,535 --> 00:44:51,200
They get a nuclear bomb in a container
and we're fuckin' dead.

593
00:44:51,235 --> 00:44:54,000
That's why you gotta live for today.

594
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,900
- What'd you say?
- That's why you gotta live for today.

595
00:44:58,935 --> 00:45:01,600
Talking about annihilation,
you stupid fuck!

596
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,000
Your kids, my kids, burning into cinders!

597
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,800
I can't even think about it.

598
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,300
You stupid...

599
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Can't even fuckin' think about it?
Motherfucker, huh?

600
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,365
Think about it now?

601
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,300
- How about now?
- Hey, Tony!

602
00:45:21,335 --> 00:45:22,865
Tony, take it easy.

603
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,100
- Take a walk.
- Get some air.

604
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,200
Take a walk.
Take a walk outside.

605
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,500
Sorry, everybody.

606
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,400
Come on, take it easy.

607
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,665
- I wake you up?
- Yeah.

608
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,600
I just come from the hospital.

609
00:45:53,635 --> 00:45:55,500
They said you wanted to know.

610
00:45:55,535 --> 00:45:58,000
Oh, how's he doing?

611
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,400
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

612
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,900
Doctor has a peel at one.

613
00:46:08,935 --> 00:46:11,100
- Hi.
- How you doing, hon?

614
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,800
- Call me?
- Yeah.

615
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,265
- Bye.
- See you later.

616
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,700
- That the dermatology nurse?
- Yeah.

617
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,000
- Nice-looking.
- They get all the skin treatments half-price.

618
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,365
So, what'd they say?
He's gonna be OK, the kid?

619
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,400
He's big, strapping, he'll be all right,
but some hearing loss, one ear.

620
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,365
Looks like it could be permanent.

621
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,500
Skip, the poor fuck knows
he should keep his mouth shut.

622
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,600
Go over there.

623
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,000
You make sure he gets the best.

624
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,300
Thing is, Tone, he's quitting the Bing.

625
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,800
And he told Sil, he goes,

626
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,300
"I'd appreciate if Tony don't come visit me. "

627
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,500
He don't wanna see you.

628
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,300
I told him watch his mouth.

629
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,465
These things happen, T.

630
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,400
That's why I don't like to talk politics.

631
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,300
- You did?
- Please, I couldn't believe it myself.

632
00:47:32,335 --> 00:47:35,565
- Well, are you going back with Tony?
- No.

633
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,700
- Then why'd you say it?
- I don't know. It just came out.

634
00:47:38,735 --> 00:47:40,300
Asshole. He was gonna call me.

635
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,700
- Did he?
- Jerk.

636
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,000
Come in!

637
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,300
Uncle Pat.

638
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,865
- Where's AJ?
- He's not coming.

639
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,800
You lose 'em for a little bit,
but he'll be back.

640
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,200
Hi, Uncle Tone!

641
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,400
- Before dinner?
- Half?

642
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,665
Thank you.

643
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,900
Mahatma Gandhi over here. Nice.

644
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,600
I thought I heard your voice.

645
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,465
- Hello?
- Good game on later.

646
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,750
I think we're on the do-not-call list.

647
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:31,965
Oh, no, we're happy with our service.

648
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,600
Those telemarketers...
just hang up, hang up!

649
00:48:34,635 --> 00:48:37,500
We're just sitting down to dinner.

650
00:48:37,535 --> 00:48:39,800
OK, please don't call again.

651
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,700
Thank you.

652
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,400
Come on!

653
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,065
It's a G5. It's got a 64-bit architecture.

654
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,765
A different language
now with these computers.

655
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,200
I saw a show on computers,
how the prices have dropped so low

656
00:49:03,235 --> 00:49:05,300
that you can buy one
for $500 at Costco

657
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,200
more powerful than the one that put
the astronauts on the moon.

658
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,200
Good eggplant, Jan.

659
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,700
Yeah, delicious.

660
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,700
I wonder where Harpo's
eating his Sunday dinner.

661
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,700
What?

662
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,965
Just wondering what Harpo's up to.

663
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,100
- Who's Harpo?
- That's Hal, Janice's son.

664
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,500
- You have a son?
- You didn't tell us that.

665
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,900
You know that song,

666
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,300
Harpo's Song by Phoebe Snow?

667
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,000
That's the song
you named Harpo after, right?

668
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,400
He's half
French-Canadian, Harpo.

669
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,500
All right, Tony.
Make fun of a boy because of his name.

670
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,300
I wonder what's French-Canadian
for "I grew up without a mother. "

671
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,100
Where is my mama?

672
