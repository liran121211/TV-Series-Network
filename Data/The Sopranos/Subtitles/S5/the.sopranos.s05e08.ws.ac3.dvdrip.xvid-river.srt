1
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Look at this.

2
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,665
The house sang out to us
of Miami and Taormina

3
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,300
where we had our honeymoon -
Nicole said, "Let's buy it. "

4
00:01:55,335 --> 00:01:58,317
Can just about smell the salt.

5
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:01,300
You mean the painting or the view?

6
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,465
Both.

7
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,400
That's called the trumpay la oil.

8
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,900
Fool the eye. It was done by an artist right
here in West Hempstead.

9
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:13,217
I'll be damned.

10
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:15,500
Follow me, Jerry.

11
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,900
This little bitch is for you.

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's a Whirlpool Duet, top of the line.

13
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,900
Same as mine.
Nicole is head over heels with it.

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,965
This is above and beyond, Carmine.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,200
Thank my father too,
may he rest in peace.

16
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:32,965
This is for Freeport. It's a token.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,400
You know it's my understanding, Carmine,
that Johnny is still sore about that.

18
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:40,600
That's why I appreciate your support.
I'm moved up here now.

19
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,400
You and me are gonna do
great things together.

20
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:44,865
Amen.

21
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,900
Daddy, Daddy! The boat is sinking!

22
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,100
Carmine! My God!

23
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,700
I just sailed her up
from Miami three weeks ago. She was fine.

24
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,300
You should call the coastguard, Carmine.

25
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,500
Oh, shit!

26
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,465
It's OK, take it easy.

27
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,600
After all these years of marriage,

28
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,200
you know what you find yourself thinking
in your private moments?

29
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,500
Please, God, let me die first.

30
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,500
I don't wanna miss him.

31
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,100
He's gonna be all right.

32
00:03:58,135 --> 00:04:00,100
You're lucky.

33
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,400
In some way, you've been spared that.

34
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:07,700
Well, you and Tony calling it quits now.

35
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,700
Maybe we should cancel the party.

36
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,065
Maybe he'll be fine by his birthday.

37
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,200
You know he's turning 75, Ma,
that's a milestone.

38
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,500
He's got some bruising. He's very lucky.

39
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,300
Those hedges broke his fall. But a few
days of rest and he should be fine.

40
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,700
The neurologist is giving him a final look,
then you can take him home.

41
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:39,200
- Thank you so much, Doctor.
- Thank God.

42
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,400
His roofing days are over,
I'll tell you that right now.

43
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,900
I guess.

44
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,300
So, what do you think about the party?

45
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,465
Jeez, Ma, I...

46
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,700
I think we should go for it.

47
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,400
Well, what do you think about inviting Tony?

48
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, that's the thing.
I don't know if I should or not.

49
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,400
Everybody would understand if you didn't.

50
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,600
- You're separated.
- I know.

51
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,800
Just the idea of having a family party

52
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,200
in the backyard without Tony
manning the grill, playing host...

53
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,100
It wouldn't be the same.

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,100
- It's gonna be OK, baby.
- Why don't they take care of this man?

55
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,400
I think it's a very wise decision.

56
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,400
What decision? I haven't made one.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,400
I thought I heard you say that you had.

58
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,400
That he wasn't coming.

59
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,400
Maserati.

60
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,965
- Kind of draws attention, no?
- True.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,365
Friends of ours, most of 'em probably
wouldn't own it.

62
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,100
It was always a dream of mine
to own a fine Italian sports car.

63
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,965
Salute.

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And in the Guinea grey it looks fantastic.

65
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:03,100
Tops out 176 miles per hour.

66
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,400
Standing quarter in 13 and change.

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,300
- How many horses?
- 390.

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,200
- What'd that set you back? About...
- 99 and change.

69
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:15,600
You're spending like you're on the throne.

70
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,000
- I had a good year.
- Oh, God bless.

71
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:22,300
While we're doing car talk here, Phil...

72
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,750
Madonna, he won't let that thing go.

73
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,100
He owed me money
and he was ducking me.

74
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,065
I'm not saying you're wrong.

75
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,000
Phil treats nickels like manhole covers.
Believe me, I know.

76
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:34,800
The loyal captains need to know
I stand behind them.

77
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,300
Fucking Little Carmine.

78
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,300
This asshole's giving away
washing machines. You believe that?

79
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,700
He don't have
collision insurance, fucking Phil?

80
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,600
His son-in-law's a broker.

81
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,100
They let it lapse looking for a better rate.

82
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Fucking idiot.

83
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,600
Tony, I ruled in your favour.

84
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,000
The racetrack, the money Philly owed you.

85
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,700
If I'm paying for it,
we do it at Pussy's or not at all.

86
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,400
His wife's running the body shop now.

87
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,900
I can at least control expenses.

88
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,900
Thanks.

89
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,500
Come on. Get in. I'll take you for a ride.

90
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,700
Fucking thing's so powerful,
I had to take a lesson from the dealer.

91
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,900
It's pretty low.

92
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,900
- How's Ginny like the car?
- She loves it.

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
She hasn't driven with me. With her knee,
she has a little trouble getting into the seat.

94
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,650
Tony, hi.

95
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:10,465
Hey, Ange.

96
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,400
- How are ya?
- Good.

97
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,300
A friend of mine banged up
his car pretty good

98
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,550
so I was thinking, maybe help us both out

99
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:21,700
and throw a little business your way.

100
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
You didn't need to come. Phone me.

101
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,300
The thing is, I gotta pay for the repairs.

102
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,765
Long story, I distracted him
while he was driving.

103
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,300
Anyway, the point being that anything
you can do to keep costs in line

104
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,300
would be a big help to me.

105
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,400
You look like you're doing pretty good since
we had that phone call

106
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:47,700
where you asked me
could you take over Puss's body shop.

107
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,600
Thank you for that, Tony.

108
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,600
You didn't have to say yes with all the other
kind of business you do through here.

109
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,100
His name is Phil,
and Carmela sends her love.

110
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:00,200
Please say hello!

111
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,700
Finally.
I left a message I was gonna come by.

112
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Well, I got in late.

113
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,350
The girl called in sick.

114
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:39,600
You should get a new one.

115
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Have a seat.

116
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,500
May I get you anything?

117
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,600
How's your father?

118
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,600
Much better.

119
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,800
Oh, thanks.

120
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,700
He'll be fine for the party, thank God.

121
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,800
Well, that's good.

122
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
- What party?
- His 75th birthday?

123
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,500
The surprise party
we talked about last summer?

124
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,700
- Oh, yeah. That's coming up?
- Next Saturday.

125
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,900
But actually that's why I wanted to come by.

126
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:36,500
I think maybe it would be best...

127
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,100
be easier anyway, for both of us, if...

128
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:41,600
if I went at it alone,

129
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,400
and not have you there.

130
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,200
My father would love to have you there.

131
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,200
He's crazy about your sausages
and all the rest of it, but...

132
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,600
I thought, "Why put us and people
in an uncomfortable situation?"

133
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,700
I decided right away
when we broke up I wasn't coming.

134
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,300
Really?

135
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,300
I'm so glad you understand.

136
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,200
It was hard for me
to come to this decision, let alone tell you.

137
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,350
Well, I'd like to contribute anyway.

138
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:24,600
No, Mom and I are taking care of it.

139
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,800
For Hugh's 75th? I insist.

140
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,300
I would rather see you
go back to your therapist.

141
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,000
I'd like to see you go to a therapist!
And I'm not the only one.

142
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:35,700
Oh, really?

143
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,900
You can tell them all I can't afford it.

144
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's not really your business
any more whether I go or what!

145
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,100
I brought you some Danish and coffee.

146
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,600
Fucking medication.

147
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,500
I can't think. I can't stay awake.

148
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,165
It don't have that side effect.

149
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,600
But it'll help your outlook if you'd take it
consistently like you're supposed to.

150
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,265
What's on?

151
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,700
It said in the guide it's an Italian movie,

152
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,800
but even with the captions
I can't tell what's what.

153
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,200
They had Jesus hanging off a helicopter,

154
00:12:34,235 --> 00:12:36,500
but you could tell it was a dummy.

155
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
You know who I saw at the bakery?

156
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,765
How the fuck could I know?

157
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,100
Rosalie Aprile. There's a surprise party
for Carmela's father next week.

158
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,100
He's gonna be 75. You get an invite?

159
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,600
No, but we go way back
to when Moses wore short pants.

160
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,400
I'd better call Hugh.
Tell him not to expect me.

161
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,700
It's a surprise party, Jun'.

162
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,600
What are we, children?

163
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,600
At our age it's enough surprise
we're still alive every morning.

164
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,400
- What cities and states, please?
- In West Orange.

165
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,700
DeAngelis, Hugo.

166
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,900
The call can automatically be completed
by pressing one

167
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,900
for an additional charge of 35 cents.

168
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:29,100
What the fuck? It's over anyhow.

169
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,100
Hello?

170
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,500
- Who is this?
- Corrado Soprano.

171
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,500
Corrado. How are ya?

172
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,400
How am I? I'm a prisoner in my own
home is how I am.

173
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,400
- What do we live for?
- Yeah.

174
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,800
Anyhow, I wanted to wish you
a buona fortuna,

175
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,565
and also send you my regrets.

176
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,400
- I'd love to be at your jubilee...
- Junior.

177
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,100
- Jubilee?
- But the government

178
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,000
says I can't leave the house,

179
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:07,800
and my family keeps me sedated.

180
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,100
Bobby told me it was a surprise party
but I told him... I go,

181
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,800
"At our age it's enough surprise
every day when we get up in the morning. "

182
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,265
I suppose so.

183
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,100
So happy birthday,
my friend, and many more.

184
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,100
To think, when I got out of the joint
they thought an air bag was Paulie Walnuts.

185
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,065
- How'd we do this week?
- Good.

186
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,300
The Acura dealer,
what's his name, he took 20 units.

187
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,800
Carlo gave me the OK to make some
personnel changes at the warehouse.

188
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:07,100
Your call.

189
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,300
I don't know. The air bag thing, it earns good.

190
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,000
It's not hard work, Christ knows, but...

191
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,065
But what?

192
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,700
I could be a lot more service in other areas.
And getting straightened out wouldn't hurt.

193
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,400
Just eat what's on your plate right now.

194
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,300
- Christ, what's it been, a month?
- I'm a team player, cousin. Charlie Hustle.

195
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,300
If that's what you want, I'll do it.

196
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,300
Look.

197
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,500
- If you need some money...
- Get the fuck out of here.

198
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,800
All right. Let's go get a drink.

199
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,865
What should I get Hugh for his birthday?

200
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,000
I was thinking cigars but I figured
you were probably gonna bring some.

201
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,800
Actually I decided not to go.

202
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,500
In light of the situation, I went, I saw Carm,

203
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I told her I thought it'd be best if I sit it out.

204
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,565
Hi, Phil, Joe.

205
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,000
Where's your brother-in-law, doll?

206
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:31,200
I wouldn't know.

207
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,300
Hey, Philip, how the hell are you?

208
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,065
- How's the neck?
- Where's the car?

209
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,165
We all passed a lotta water
since the old days, huh?

210
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,800
I was away when all that shit
went down with your brother.

211
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:46,665
What the fuck happened?

212
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,200
We don't like to talk about it.

213
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,300
Your car's in here, Phil.

214
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,500
It's all set.

215
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
What the fuck is this?

216
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,765
It was a front-end collision, Phil.

217
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,800
- This new paint isn't as brilliant.
- It's factory paint, same as original.

218
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:17,100
It is different. It's duller.

219
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,300
Something's off with the seat.

220
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:30,300
What is it, Phil?

221
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,200
Feels off kilter. Try it, Joey.

222
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,150
You're right. It's off its axis.

223
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:49,500
It reclines strange too. Try it.

224
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,100
Nobody said anything about the seats.

225
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,800
This is unacceptable.

226
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,500
Come on, Joey.
Give me a call when you get the job done.

227
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,000
A couple of days, Phil.

228
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
We did what was asked of us.

229
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,100
Call me when it's done right.

230
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,600
So, Dad, how does dinner
at Vesuvio's sound for your birthday?

231
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,400
Just us. We'll come here first
for the presents

232
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,000
and then we'll go over there.

233
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,000
Sure, sure. That sounds fine.

234
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,100
- Did somebody tell you something?
- I know all about it.

235
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,000
- You can save the cloak and dagger.
- AJ!

236
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,100
What?

237
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,100
- Junior Soprano told me all about it.
- That miserable fucking man.

238
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,865
You don't know the half.

239
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,065
Relax. I'm fine with knowing.

240
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,800
At my age, it's surprise enough
to be able to get out of bed every morning.

241
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:51,800
So who's coming to this shindig?

242
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,665
God damn him!

243
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,100
All of us, your brother Lester, Dr Fegoli.

244
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,565
Russ Fegoli? He's in town?

245
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,765
He retired from the Foreign Service.

246
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,600
But they were living
out in Marin County or wherever.

247
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,050
Well, they settled on Jersey.

248
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:09,400
Octavia, the oldest, lives here.

249
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,400
Wait, who's Dr Faggo?

250
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:15,865
Fegoli. Feg.

251
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,400
She of the five-page Christmas card.
And on Flag Day,

252
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,700
Papa Russ shook hands
with Andrew Cuomo.

253
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,700
What an honour. B-F-D.

254
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,900
The Fegoli kids finished college.

255
00:19:26,935 --> 00:19:28,965
That's what sticks in your craw.

256
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,100
When he got that medal, you two weren't
even invited to the ceremony.

257
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
It was out in California!

258
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,000
They knew that your father
doesn't like to be out of his element.

259
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,200
Now, here's someone
we can all be proud of, Anthony.

260
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,000
Dr Fegoli served in the State Department.

261
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,100
In Rome, he was career assistant
to the ambassador to the Vatican.

262
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,965
He got a medal from the Pope himself.

263
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,400
- Wow.
- But when we were kids in the navy,

264
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,565
he had such a bad case of the crabs

265
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,400
we used to call him
the Governor of Maryland.

266
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,217
Stop acting like a child.

267
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:06,000
Lighten up. He's old enough.

268
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,600
She's right, knock it off.

269
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,300
- Who else is coming?
- Freddy Di Novi...

270
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Tony'll love him.

271
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,865
Who else?

272
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,000
Dad, Tony isn't coming to the party.

273
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,800
Why?

274
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,365
Well, I felt that since we're separated,

275
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,400
we should get used
to the idea of living separate lives.

276
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,165
That's a crock of shit.

277
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,500
Don't talk to her like that.

278
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,200
I've known the man for 20-something years!
It's his house!

279
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,465
Tony is in agreement with me.

280
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,700
Because you put the screws to him.

281
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,965
- I'll cancel the party.
- Go ahead.

282
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,800
I'm not coming
if the man of the house isn't there.

283
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,300
Tony, it's Angie. We did all the repairs
you said on Phil's car.

284
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,100
He came today and now he found
a dent in the rear.

285
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,965
- His seat. There's a problem with that.
- His seat?

286
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,400
I didn't wanna get into these extras
without checking with you.

287
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:06,600
You wanna run a body shop,
run a body shop.

288
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,800
You claimed your piece of the garage.

289
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,000
So you wanna be in business,
do what you think the situation calls for.

290
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:14,900
I wanna put my kids through college.

291
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,065
That's a good thing, Ange.

292
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,300
Some women left alone like that
would've given up.

293
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,200
Tony, before I outlay for these costs,
I need to know...

294
00:21:24,235 --> 00:21:28,000
Ange, I'm not there, what do I know?
It's your call.

295
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,800
Tone. What's up?

296
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,665
Pussy's Body Shop is one
of your stops, right?

297
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,900
They're fixing the fucking Shah of Iran's car.
Be there when he picks it up.

298
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,400
Make sure he's happy, but don't let the shit
spiral out of control.

299
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,300
- Right. I'll take care of it.
- Thanks.

300
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm on my way to Welsh Farms,
get a triple blueberry sundae.

301
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,650
Good for you. Enjoy.

302
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:08,700
Hot summer night...

303
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Go for it. You deserve it.

304
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,900
All right, yeah. I'll talk to you later.

305
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,400
- Opus.
- Fine choice.

306
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,600
Angelo here spoke very highly of you,

307
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,100
how you handled yourself in Pennsylvania.

308
00:22:28,135 --> 00:22:29,900
That's why I wanted to meet you.

309
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,400
We were like Frick and Frack in the can.

310
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,365
Angelo's my buddy.

311
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,500
He knew the Jackie Gleason stuff by heart.
He acted all the parts.

312
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,100
Do a little bit for Rusty, the mambo thing.

313
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,800
Mambo? Oh, Carlos
was teaching you the mambo!

314
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,300
That's a different story!

315
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,900
Get out! Get out!

316
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,800
So how's your re-entry been?
You doing OK?

317
00:23:01,835 --> 00:23:03,700
Yeah. Tony's been good with me.

318
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,400
- I always liked your cousin.
- He's a real gentleman.

319
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:09,500
Angelo's looking out for you too.

320
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,900
I told Rusty that you might need a little earn.

321
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,300
Yeah, I could use a little cash injection,
maybe a push up the pyramid.

322
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
You know, time served?

323
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,100
We need something done.

324
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,300
A nice little payday for you,

325
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,600
and an opportunity for you to hone
that rep you left behind.

326
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,950
And this involves?

327
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:36,900
Somebody needs to go.

328
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,000
Anyone I know?

329
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,700
New York guy, not Jersey.

330
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,100
- Who is he with?
- Friend of a friend.

331
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:50,900
Not a friend of ours.

332
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
A friend of Johnny's.

333
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,300
- You guys got to settle that shit.
- It's not the boat.

334
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,900
It's not the boat.

335
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,800
It's Lorraine Calluzzo.

336
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,100
Rainey Calluzzo.

337
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,400
Little Carmine went to school with her.

338
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,900
They go back that far.

339
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,700
Kill a woman? Come on.

340
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,300
I can't sign on right now.

341
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,500
I wanna give my cousin
the benefit of the doubt.

342
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,000
He don't want us involved
in this problem over here anyway.

343
00:24:33,035 --> 00:24:35,700
Why don't you think about it for a bit?

344
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
I don't know. I don't think so,

345
00:24:37,835 --> 00:24:40,300
but thanks, guys.

346
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,700
We had a big talk over here the other day

347
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,300
and the consensus seems to want
your presence at my father's party.

348
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:49,200
Well, that's nice
but it's kinda short notice.

349
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:52,000
Look, it's for my father, not me.

350
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,900
I made plans to go fishing with Sil.

351
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,900
Well, he really wants you there. If you
could make it, he would be very happy.

352
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:03,900
He's very fond of you.

353
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,600
The New York salsicc',
hickory wood, whatever.

354
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,465
You're not using Artie?

355
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,900
I got him doing appetisers
but he's really there as a guest.

356
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,500
I am cooking.

357
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,900
Tomorrow's gonna be a madhouse,
just a living hell.

358
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,300
I don't know, I'll...

359
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,700
I'll see what I can do.

360
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,700
Thank you, Tony, I appreciate it.

361
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,365
Jerry said to refrigerate.

362
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,100
I think there is room in the garage.

363
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,300
I know you're shorthanded.
I thought you might need some help.

364
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:57,800
It's my weekend with the boys.
They'll stay out of the way.

365
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,700
Aunt Carmela is nice enough
to let you guys enjoy her pool,

366
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,900
and you wanna destroy her property.

367
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,000
It's a beach chair! It can get wet.

368
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,500
Don't get smart! You wanna go home?

369
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,365
What can I do?

370
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
The dips. I forgot the dips.

371
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,800
I gotta duck out later.
I could get some at Grand Union.

372
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,900
Grand Union closed ten years ago.

373
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,000
You know what? Frig the dip.
They'll have to survive with salsa.

374
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,500
Can I make you a cocktail?
I make a mean Rusty Nail.

375
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,500
Now? No.

376
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,400
Thanks again for letting
the kids take a swim.

377
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,400
Any time, you know that.

378
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,600
Cheers.

379
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,900
They love being here.

380
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
This is truly a beautiful home.

381
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,200
What, are you here, five years now?

382
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,500
I asked you to get up at 11:00.
We got a lot to do today.

383
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:13,100
You were supposed to send
this for summer school.

384
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,100
Put it down!

385
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,300
- Greetings, birthday people.
- You are here, which is great.

386
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,100
You can help with the setup.

387
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:25,365
Hi, Mrs Soprano.

388
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,800
This is our Uncle Tony.
This is Meadow's friend Finn.

389
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,600
What are you doing?

390
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,500
I'm making Grandpa's favourite icebox cake.

391
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,600
- We have cake.
- Why don't you take a swim? You're hot.

392
00:27:38,635 --> 00:27:40,965
Do you have a towel?

393
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I'll bring you a coffee too.

394
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,600
- I'll be outside.
- Cake pan?

395
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,450
Meadow, I have a lot to do today.

396
00:27:48,485 --> 00:27:50,600
Hello? I'm making dessert... to help.

397
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,800
- He seems like a nice guy.
- Yep.

398
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,100
- Any luck with Kelly?
- No.

399
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,300
I've been scouring
the internet for any trace.

400
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,900
Here is your cake pan.

401
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,300
And you're gonna clean up
your baking mess!

402
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,800
I can imagine how much
you must miss her, your only daughter.

403
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,400
What was she, like 11,
when she lived with you guys?

404
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,700
We had her 12th birthday party
right before she moved out.

405
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,700
- How'd she do in school then?
- Straight As.

406
00:28:42,735 --> 00:28:45,600
My God. What is the matter with them?

407
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,600
Don't lift that by yourself, Hugh,
wait for some help.

408
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,150
What are you doing here?
You always do this!

409
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:01,642
- The party is not for hours!
- He needs help.

410
00:29:01,677 --> 00:29:04,100
What am I doing?
Returning your port-a-vac.

411
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,400
- You said you needed it.
- Happy birthday.

412
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,500
- Later for that. Get your uncle out here.
- He left. He said he told you.

413
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,000
He asked us to watch the twins.

414
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,400
Here, help me with this.

415
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,700
My goodness. What a bother.
Excuse us for living.

416
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,665
How you doing? I'm Tony.

417
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,300
Yeah, the other Tony's cousin, right?

418
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
It reclines perfectly, try it.

419
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,600
Fuck that. I don't feel
like I'm sitting at 12 o'clock.

420
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,800
You're sitting at 12 o'clock.

421
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,000
- May I?
- I don't give a fuck.

422
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,100
You can sit in there
till fucking San Gennaro.

423
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,200
It'll still need to be dealt with.
This car went through a major collision.

424
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,300
It seems OK.

425
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,700
How could it be OK if it's askew?

426
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,200
What's the matter?
You got an eye problem?

427
00:30:06,235 --> 00:30:07,865
You look like Stevie Wonder!

428
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,150
What'd I say? I didn't say nothing.

429
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:12,400
Replacing the seat will cost a fortune.

430
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,865
Give me a break, Phil. The seat is fine.

431
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:20,000
You have a problem with the grain
on the leather. You think I'm stupid?

432
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,900
Don't take it out on me!

433
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,100
Come on, Joey.

434
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,400
How about this?
Replace the tracks under the seat,

435
00:30:29,435 --> 00:30:31,200
maybe throw in a CD player.

436
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,065
We already replaced the tracks.

437
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,300
- He's got a CD player.
- Jesus God, Duke,

438
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,500
they're hosing us for a $2,000 factory seat!

439
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,765
Come on, Joey.

440
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,400
- Tony, nice to meet you.
- Come on! You coming?

441
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,600
Joe, try to keep him cooled down.

442
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,400
Here you go, Freddy.

443
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,800
Get it, Jason! Come on!

444
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,765
My God.

445
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,250
- Ma, what?
- Dr Fegoli... Russ.

446
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,700
- What?
- He's allergic to tomatoes.

447
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,300
All right, so we will deal with it.

448
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:34,400
Jesus.

449
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Don't you have any hors d'oeuvres
without tomatoes?

450
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,100
The prosciutto-wrapped chèvre.
Rosalie just took 'em out.

451
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,050
An Italian allergic to pomodori?

452
00:31:49,085 --> 00:31:51,700
Dio mio. You have my sympathies.

453
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,565
It wasn't always like this.

454
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,200
It started when they gave me radiation
for my prostate. Don't ask me why.

455
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,200
Did you know Monsignor Kelly? He was
in charge of the tours at all the catacombs.

456
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:06,100
- I made you a plate, Russ.
- Thank you, Mary.

457
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,500
You know, Carmela's mother-in-law Livia
detested northern cooking.

458
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:13,900
- Really, why?
- She skeeved the butter.

459
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,300
The father was like that, too.
The whole Soprano bunch.

460
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,600
So many Neapolitans
and Sicilians feel that way.

461
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,900
You really have to go to Italy to know
and so many of them don't.

462
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,900
I ate like a champ up and down the boot
the whole two weeks.

463
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,200
But those recipes that you used
to send me from Tuscany, Lena.

464
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,000
My God, they were a revelation.

465
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,300
Bollito misto, osso bucco...

466
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,900
The lovely Carmela.
Would you like to say a few words?

467
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,200
He's back, thank God.
Will you get the guests arriving?

468
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,900
Where the hell is Tony?

469
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,665
Have a glass of wine, it'll calm you down.

470
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,400
He is bringing the charcoal
and the sausage. Always the last minute.

471
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:58,200
- I heard that.
- Finally.

472
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,600
- She's got no faith in me.
- I wonder why?

473
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,500
Pins and needles, needles and pins.

474
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,000
Palumbo's - the birthday boy's favourite.

475
00:33:11,035 --> 00:33:12,900
- Where is he?
- He's out back.

476
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,565
Oh, good.

477
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,200
Honey, pace yourself.

478
00:33:17,235 --> 00:33:19,765
Hey, there he is!

479
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,900
Hey, happy birthday to you

480
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:24,400
Got salsiccia for you

481
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,200
Russ, wait till you taste this.
There's nothing else like it.

482
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:34,700
I want you to meet
a couple of our oldest friends,

483
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,600
Dr Russ and Lena Fegoli.

484
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:38,400
Nice to meet you, sir.

485
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,500
My son-in-law...
Well, whatever... Tony Soprano.

486
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,400
A doctor, huh? That's good.
Somebody usually goes down at these.

487
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,865
He's just joking.

488
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,700
Unfortunately, my doctorate
is in international affairs.

489
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,000
From Princeton.

490
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,000
- GI Bill.
- So you're a doctor like...

491
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,500
Kissinger's a doctor.

492
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,965
Yes.

493
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,800
Russ had an audience with four popes.

494
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,000
- What section did you all sit in?
- Idiot!

495
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,300
TB, make sure you shoot the food tables
before they're pillaged.

496
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,700
Well, I'd love to stay and chat
but I got a fire to start.

497
00:34:21,735 --> 00:34:24,500
- Nice to meet you, Doc.
- Nice to meet you.

498
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,700
Everybody!
Could you gather around, please?

499
00:34:37,735 --> 00:34:40,300
Everybody, everybody!

500
00:34:40,335 --> 00:34:42,100
Come on over.

501
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,700
I would like to make
a toast to the man of the hour,

502
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,465
a very special man,

503
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,100
a man who I love more than words
could possibly say...

504
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,465
- My father.
- Hear, hear!

505
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,900
You are the best
father and grandfather in the world.

506
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,200
Speech, speech!

507
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,200
You are the greatest, my little Melly.

508
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,000
Thank you for everything.

509
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,800
Tony, thank you for having us at your home.

510
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,400
Mare, my lovely bride.

511
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,465
Still the prettiest girl in the world.

512
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,900
Thank you for putting up
with me all these years.

513
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,500
Thank all you freeloaders for coming!

514
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,900
- Why don't you open up your gifts, Dad?
- Not now, Carmela.

515
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:53,100
- It's very mercenary.
- Well, good.

516
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:55,500
People spent money on them.

517
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,800
I'll break the ice.

518
00:35:57,835 --> 00:36:00,265
Here.

519
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,700
- Open this one.
- It's from him.

520
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,900
You're too much.

521
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,200
A Stratocaster?

522
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,065
A Beretta.

523
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,300
- It's a shotgun.
- Shotgun?

524
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,500
This is... I don't know what to say.

525
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,600
It's a Giubileo 12-gauge. 28-inch barrel.

526
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,865
Nice to have money.

527
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,565
Get me another Rolling Rock, Jay.

528
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,300
What time did you start drinking today?

529
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:49,800
Probably right after you got up.

530
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:51,900
Coz!

531
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,300
Tony, can you bring the camera over here
and get a shot of this?

532
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,100
Sure, I got nothing better to do.

533
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,300
I expect a freezer full of venison this year.

534
00:37:08,335 --> 00:37:10,600
You got it, kid.

535
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,500
Beautiful piece. The over-under action,

536
00:37:28,535 --> 00:37:30,700
the engraving, they're artisans.

537
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,300
And you know, I've been
to the Beretta studio in Brescia.

538
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,100
No kidding. I'd love to see that.

539
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,300
You know, that company
goes back to the 1500s.

540
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,565
Madonna!

541
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,150
Sure, the best pieces...

542
00:37:46,185 --> 00:37:48,700
they never export, you see.

543
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,665
I want one and all here to know

544
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,500
what a wild man Hugo was in his day.

545
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,765
Remember what he did
at the Bund meeting in Paterson?

546
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,700
- Threw that cherry bomb on those Krauts?
- Yeah, tell that one.

547
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,900
You made my father's year with that gun.

548
00:38:14,935 --> 00:38:17,700
He deserves it.

549
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,500
- You look beat. Take a break.
- Nah, I'm all right.

550
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,900
- Could use a beer, though.
- Well, you got it.

551
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,600
Thanks.

552
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,200
How's that look? Done?

553
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,200
You're the grill-meister.

554
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,100
Don't get me wrong, we have
the greatest legal system in the world,

555
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:18,100
but it's becoming
more and more discriminatory.

556
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,500
If you're a minority, or worse,
an immigrant from an Arab country,

557
00:39:22,535 --> 00:39:24,600
civil rights don't apply at all.

558
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,600
In no place is the breach of civil rights
more evident than the penal system.

559
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:31,265
- Rehabilitation? Please.
- Yeah.

560
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,365
That nature of the system
instils the convict mentality

561
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,000
to the point where prison becomes the only
venue where the convict can function.

562
00:39:39,035 --> 00:39:40,900
My little bleeding heart.

563
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,500
She is wise beyond her years.

564
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:44,665
She better be,

565
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,700
all the money I'm spending
over at Liberal University in sunny Harlem.

566
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,300
Come here.

567
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,400
- How you doing?
- Good.

568
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,300
Remember when you were little
what I called you?

569
00:40:00,335 --> 00:40:02,000
You don't remember?

570
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,400
- You were too young to remember?
- Stop!

571
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,400
How could you not remember?

572
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,200
You know Hugh built this house?

573
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,900
Your friend's maxing out the situation
down at Puss's.

574
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:35,700
Sure.

575
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,200
Factory seat, 2K. I tried.

576
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
I'd hate to see Ange get stuck with that.

577
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,400
Then again, her friend is taking me
to the cleaners with this divorce shit.

578
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,800
I gotta belt-tighten.

579
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,700
Can we get some
able-bodied seamen over here?

580
00:41:02,735 --> 00:41:04,800
Tony B?

581
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
What am I, a fucking slave?

582
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,100
- I didn't have a drop.
- Goddamn you.

583
00:41:14,135 --> 00:41:16,700
Lester'll drive. He's in the bathroom.

584
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,600
Watch your head.

585
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,500
Hey! Virginia Mayo.

586
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,100
Thank you for coming.

587
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,500
I'm sorry for everything. What can I say?

588
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Get my boy home safe.

589
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,500
You're sorry? For what?

590
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,900
- No, no. I wanna hear.
- Oh, please, Carmela.

591
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,600
The off-colour jokes, the sausage twirling...

592
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,700
These are cultured Italians.

593
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,800
Russ is a success, a diplomat.

594
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,765
This was a shock for them.

595
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,965
He's such a diplomat he insults his host?

596
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,950
You heard what he said to Tony.
He's a pompous man.

597
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,900
- He always was.
- Let's talk about this another time.

598
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,100
That's why you didn't want Tony here.

599
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,565
It had nothing to do with our situation.

600
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,900
All along, it was so that your
cultured Italian friends,

601
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,265
who were born and raised
on Arthur Avenue, I might add,

602
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,700
- wouldn't meet Tony the gavone.
- He made us all look like gavones.

603
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:30,200
Whatever we are,
I am proud of it, unlike you obviously.

604
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,665
I have always been proud of my heritage.

605
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,900
Bullshit. You told Aunt Rose you were glad
DeAngelis didn't end in a vowel.

606
00:42:36,935 --> 00:42:38,900
I never said that!

607
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And when Meadow came out...
"Oh my God, she's so dark. "

608
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,900
You're drunk. I'm going home.

609
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,400
There are Italians all around
with their closet self-loathing.

610
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,400
I just never wanted to believe
my mother was one of them.

611
00:42:50,435 --> 00:42:53,200
What the fuck are you crying about?

612
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Your secret is out.

613
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,300
- Marco.
- Polo.

614
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,600
Fish out of water! You're it, Tone!

615
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,800
- I'm taking a T-O.
- Marco.

616
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,400
Here, let me get this.

617
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,400
No, I'm fine. You have fun.

618
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,300
No, no, really. Let me... I'll get it. I'll get it.

619
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,800
- Put me down!
- You look like you could use a dip!

620
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,500
- Don't you... I'm serious!
- One.

621
00:43:33,535 --> 00:43:35,400
- AJ!
- Two.

622
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
- Tony, don't!
- Three!

623
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,100
- You bastards!
- You're it, Carm.

624
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,300
- Idiots.
- Don't let her get out.

625
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
You're still it!

626
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,300
- All right. Pleasant dreams, hammers.
- Night, Dad.

627
00:44:11,335 --> 00:44:13,800
- Good night, Grandma.
- Good night.

628
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,700
- Grandma's not a maid.
- I'll put 'em in the hamper.

629
00:44:18,735 --> 00:44:20,700
- What's this?
- I don't know.

630
00:44:20,735 --> 00:44:22,700
- Yes, you do.
- Shut up.

631
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,400
Am I talking to you, Justin?

632
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,800
I asked you a question, Jason.

633
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,200
Pins.

634
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,700
From the '96 Olympics in Atlanta,
it looks like.

635
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,900
That's when you were stationed
in Saudi Arabia, right, Dad?

636
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:49,600
Yes, that's right,
but I'm talking to your brother.

637
00:44:49,635 --> 00:44:51,600
You took this tonight, didn't you?

638
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,465
I borrowed it from AJ.

639
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,500
You stole this from your cousin
who opens his house to you?

640
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,900
I found it on the floor
way in back of AJ's closet.

641
00:44:59,935 --> 00:45:02,567
He doesn't care. With all the stuff he has?

642
00:45:02,602 --> 00:45:05,200
He got to go to the Olympics
and everything.

643
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,000
I love where he lives.
I don't wanna come back here.

644
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,465
My son steals from his own family.

645
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,200
You're gonna return it tomorrow
and apologise.

646
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,400
Where are your Game Boys?

647
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,900
That's mine. Jason's is in the drawer.

648
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,600
I'm giving these to the Salvation Army.

649
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,100
- I didn't do nothing!
- You're as bad as he is

650
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:39,900
cos you didn't stop him!

651
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,700
We should get going, AJ.
I don't wanna drop you off too late.

652
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,500
Call me when you get to Patrick's.

653
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,200
Yeah, I'll try. He's in a bad cell area.

654
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,300
He'll try?

655
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,665
Just showing her he's not a kid.

656
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,400
I think he's showing her more than that.

657
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,400
That's inevitable.

658
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,100
It's scary is what that is.

659
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,500
He'll be fine.

660
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,100
- He's in love.
- Oh, please.

661
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,300
You know what it's like at that age.

662
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,300
Can't wait to see each other.

663
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,900
Can't keep your hands off each other.

664
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,100
- What am I doing?
- Tony, let's call it a night.

665
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,100
Why?

666
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,400
- You tired?
- Yes.

667
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,900
Come on. Artie is right over there.

668
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,100
He's comatose.

669
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,800
This is nice, no?

670
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,400
Doesn't it feel nice?

671
00:47:19,435 --> 00:47:21,700
I didn't say that.

672
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,400
No, Tony, don't.

673
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,050
So which type of torture instrument

674
00:48:26,085 --> 00:48:28,900
are we going to use to pound this?

675
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,500
Hello?

676
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,500
Blundetto.

677
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,500
How can I help you?

678
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,700
I'm in.

679
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,400
You asleep?

680
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,300
