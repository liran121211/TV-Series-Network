1
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:45,973
Walter, hey, you looking for me?

2
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,093
The Crazy Horse, that's you, right?

3
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:52,363
- Yeah, you got something?
- Yeah, pole camera, three days ago.

4
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:58,797
She locks up the club for the night.

5
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:04,228
She's throwing away the garbage.

6
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:06,500
Yeah?

7
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:13,893
But then she changes her mind.

8
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,188
Interesting.

9
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:30,629
The good news is no polyps.

10
00:02:30,673 --> 00:02:32,388
The bad news is, as you can see,

11
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,418
you've got a fairly severe case
of ulcerative colitis.

12
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:37,851
- Jesus Christ.
- She was getting better.

13
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:39,855
Then last week, another flare-up.

14
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:44,926
How about the Prozac? Is it helping?

15
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:47,242
She can't even sleep. Look at her.

16
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:50,752
I'd like to start you on a regime
of Prednisone. It's a steroid.

17
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:53,517
- Like for weightlifters?
- I've had great success

18
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:55,545
treating this type of condition.

19
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:58,582
I do need to warn you,
there are certain side effects.

20
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,822
These are temporary,
but there's a chance of weight gain,

21
00:03:01,865 --> 00:03:05,851
accompanied by Cushing's Syndrome,
a swelling of the facial features.

22
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:08,284
- Sort of a moon face.
- What?

23
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:10,925
You've seen Jerry Lewis
in the last year or two?

24
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,685
She's planning a wedding, for Christ's sake!

25
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:18,270
It was fine one day,
then suddenly audio and no picture.

26
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,306
- Somebody been fooling around with this?
- AJ had his friends over.

27
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:24,341
How'd he do over there with your dad?

28
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,298
- Raking the driveway?
- Fine.

29
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:30,129
Except my mother kept asking him
if we were getting back together.

30
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:35,325
You know, I dreamed
that I moved back in here.

31
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:42,038
You know, just for the record...

32
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,947
I realise what I did was wrong.

33
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:47,791
My...

34
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,139
activities while I lived here.

35
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,620
Knowing you were wrong isn't the half of it.

36
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,256
Oh, really? What's the other half?

37
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,892
Well, suppose something
did happen where...

38
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,289
theoretically, we did get back together.

39
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:05,764
- Any marriage would need fidelity.
- Like Popeye says, "I am what I am."

40
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:07,794
Well, I didn't marry a cartoon.

41
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:09,955
Well, it wouldn't be a cartoon.

42
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:14,311
You had your own indiscretions yourself.

43
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:20,258
- The thing with Furio?
- I did not sleep with him, Tony.

44
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:23,052
I'm just saying that we're all human,
that's all.

45
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,882
You know, the truth is, I got myself where I am.

46
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:34,674
But your open indiscretion, total disregard...

47
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,586
You're right, it was... it was horrible.

48
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:40,101
A knot in your stomach when the phone rings.

49
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:41,981
Like you were saying, you know.

50
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,937
Theoretically though, if we do reconcile,

51
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,212
that stuff will never happen again.

52
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:07,899
- Come on, you gonna go or what?
- I was finishing my drink.

53
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,176
Fuck!

54
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,749
You can't stay holed up here.

55
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:32,943
- That's not healthy, Carmine.
- How'd it get to this?

56
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,663
Retaliation, counterattacks...

57
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:38,092
We're at a fuckin' stagmire.

58
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:41,573
We back down now, bunker down,

59
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:45,241
what kind of a message does that send?

60
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:50,074
Not just to Johnny's people, either.
Billy Leotardo. What the hell was that?

61
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:53,112
This Blundetto asshole went off
the reservation.

62
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,989
All due respect, Carmine,

63
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,063
that's why you need to get out there,

64
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:04,299
put your ear to the street,
let the guys see you take the reins.

65
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:07,487
That's not how I wanna handle it.

66
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:23,745
Hey, don't get me wrong,
I always liked your cousin,

67
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:27,540
but whacking Phil's brother
was a major poke in the ass.

68
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:33,047
You know my cousin almost cried
when I put him in charge of the casino?

69
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:37,403
After all I did for that blue-eyed prick,
then he completely fucks me over.

70
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:42,478
Now I practically gotta get
down on my knees to Johnny Sack.

71
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:45,635
Where the fuck you been?

72
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:50,222
Highway was jammed with broken heroes
on a last-chance power drive.

73
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:53,702
Oh, you're gonna get fuckin' cute now.

74
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:58,736
- Anything on Tony B?
- Nah, he's still on a milk carton.

75
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:01,286
There she is.

76
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,287
My Smelly Valentine.

77
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:05,125
Christopher, that's not funny.

78
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,354
What the fuck are you doing?

79
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:14,668
I can handle a cocktail once in a while.

80
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:19,422
You guys OK? You need anything else?

81
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:22,453
- You're still feeling sick, hon?
- Please.

82
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:25,613
They gotta replace her colon with a semi-colon.

83
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,045
Maybe you should be a vegan.

84
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,996
- Doctor says I gotta relax.
- From what?

85
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:35,751
She's got the world at her feet,
she walks around like impending doom.

86
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,507
Come on, we gotta go.

87
00:07:44,787 --> 00:07:46,820
Take it easy, now.

88
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,003
Don't listen. People who've got
their health take it for granted.

89
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:55,007
How's your thing with...?

90
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:57,481
Just gotta keep an eye on it, that's all.

91
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:01,956
So, Carm and me are getting back together,
maybe.

92
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,908
That's great. The kids'll be thrilled.

93
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:08,863
Yeah. When we get settled,
we'll have you guys over...

94
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:10,897
Family dinner.

95
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:13,654
Feel better, huh?

96
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:25,037
John.

97
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:42,412
First off, let me just say how sorry
I am for your loss. We all are.

98
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,365
Take your fuckin' sorrys
and stick 'em in your ass.

99
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:48,923
I could say nothing, be a heartless prick.

100
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:52,035
He tried to talk, he couldn't
even say his last words.

101
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,436
Anybody ever die in your arms,
you cocksucker?

102
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:58,543
A family member, somebody you love?

103
00:08:58,593 --> 00:09:01,785
- No.
- Well, give it time.

104
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:03,940
See if I can't make that happen for you.

105
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:06,938
- That's enough.
- Philly, why don't you go have a drink?

106
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,773
Don't tell me what to do, Jimmy.

107
00:09:10,494 --> 00:09:12,164
Jimmy's right.

108
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,880
Fuck 'em, John. Fuck all of them!

109
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,777
Was that fuckin' necessary?
He shouldn't even have been here.

110
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:29,780
He's got a right to be here.

111
00:09:29,824 --> 00:09:33,175
He's got a right to a lot of things right now.

112
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,533
My cousin acted alone. I did not sanction this.

113
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:38,491
The lone-gunman theory.

114
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,367
You know how close he and Angelo were
in the can. He flipped the fuck out!

115
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:45,047
When he whacked Joey,
what flipped him out then?

116
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:47,472
What do ya want, John?
What do ya want me to say?

117
00:09:47,523 --> 00:09:51,226
I want your cousin on a fucking spit!

118
00:09:52,754 --> 00:09:54,469
I don't know where he is.

119
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:57,700
- Nobody does.
- Fine.

120
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,211
Maybe one of your other relatives then.

121
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:05,719
What, I gotta stand here
being threatened now?

122
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:08,119
All right, nobody's making threats.

123
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:14,143
Look, Tony's in hiding.

124
00:10:14,193 --> 00:10:18,338
You either deliver that prick to my door
or I will rain a shitstorm

125
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:22,087
down on you and your family
like you have never fucking seen.

126
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:27,485
We're done here.

127
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:50,795
There are over 200,000 species of molluscs,

128
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:54,227
and right there is a good example
of a conch,

129
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:56,866
which is also known as a knobbed whelk.

130
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:59,262
See, these raised spines...

131
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:02,819
That's what I call my dick.

132
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:05,051
I heard that.

133
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:07,927
That's just nasty.

134
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,442
Oh, fuck! Yo, check it!

135
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:13,154
Oh, shit! Hurry up!

136
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,254
Don't touch it!

137
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,497
Apprentice Delaney, get back here!

138
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,995
Little Meadow in a bridal gown.

139
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:38,309
Couple more years, Grandma and Grandpa.

140
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:40,465
Bite your tongue.

141
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:49,325
So, the other day,
what you said, I processed it.

142
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:54,034
You know, your feelings.

143
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:59,228
It really hit home with me, finally.

144
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:07,374
With you out of the house,
I've had a chance to do a lot of thinking.

145
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:10,450
I mean, it's partly my fault

146
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:13,365
but I need something else in my life.

147
00:12:13,406 --> 00:12:16,870
You know, with Meadow
getting engaged, AJ almost...

148
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,067
You want another kid.

149
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:21,544
No.

150
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:38,238
It turns out there is a lot
for sale over on Crestview,

151
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,153
a little over an acre.

152
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:43,182
I was thinking I could build a spec house

153
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,657
and take my dad in as a partner.

154
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:50,210
I mean, my allowance is what it is, but...

155
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:56,637
- How much is the lot?
- 600,000.

156
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:03,511
Anyway, he would oversee the construction.

157
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:09,660
Well, I'll call Ginsberg and...

158
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:12,851
have him free up a down payment.

159
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:14,960
And then?

160
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:18,559
I'll move back in.

161
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:27,297
Supposing that happened, what about
the other issues that were on the table?

162
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:29,294
Well...

163
00:13:30,262 --> 00:13:32,373
I swear to you, on our children,

164
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:39,400
that my midlife crisis problems will
no longer intrude on you any more.

165
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:03,394
Are you having dinner?

166
00:14:03,438 --> 00:14:08,184
- Have you settled on a caterer yet?
- Can I talk to you?

167
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:22,431
- You hear from Tony?
- I talked to Kelvin... Calvin... whatever.

168
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:24,310
That redneck from North Carolina.

169
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,822
The Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco called.

170
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:30,065
A bodega in Newark's selling
cigarettes without tax stamps.

171
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:33,060
Stupid spics were supposed
to stamp 'em themselves.

172
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:35,089
The feds are all over it now.

173
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:37,567
I don't got enough on my fuckin' mind?

174
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:46,465
- Any idea how you're gonna handle that?
- Handle what?

175
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:49,708
Our cousin, you know, Phil and John.

176
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,101
I don't know, I gotta think about it.

177
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:58,366
From now on, Paulie supervises
the cigarette run. You split everything with him.

178
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:00,241
- What?
- You fuckin' heard me.

179
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,482
I got a fuckin' wedding to pay for.

180
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,877
Well, if I were you, I'd cut out the open bar!

181
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:16,896
Fuck this piece of shit.
I'm done! You hear me?

182
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,249
Put my life on the line! My fuckin' life!

183
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,356
Baby, I hate seeing you like this.

184
00:15:23,406 --> 00:15:24,837
Fuck family, fuck loyalty.

185
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:27,473
You cost him a dime, you're a fuckin' pariah.

186
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,983
I gave that fuck pieces of my soul, Adriana.

187
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,178
You know what he said to me?

188
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:36,612
- He said I should have a fuckin' drink!
- When?

189
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:39,012
Up there, when we were up
at Uncle Pat's farm.

190
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:42,487
You don't need to listen to him.
Isn't that why you have a sponsor?

191
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:44,960
Him and Tony B, breaking my balls,

192
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:47,231
teasing me like when I was little.

193
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,187
What kind of fucked-up,
undermining shit is that

194
00:15:51,234 --> 00:15:53,789
to tell someone who's got the disease?

195
00:15:57,342 --> 00:16:01,452
You know I could take him out
in a second, that fat fuck. Bang!

196
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,606
His kids wouldn't even give a shit.

197
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:08,033
Don't talk like that. You're a better man
than he is, a better person.

198
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:10,034
Fuck all this shit with Paulie.

199
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,462
You know what hurts me worse,
right to my heart?

200
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:17,463
Him and our ass-wipe cousin,
that two-faced cocksucker.

201
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,115
He could get us all killed with New York
and him...

202
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,985
Tony has to think about
what to do with him now, after all this shit!

203
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:29,942
Me, he don't need to fuckin' think!

204
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:33,206
Well, maybe I need to think!

205
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:36,883
Ever thought of that, you fat fuckin' scumbag?

206
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:50,005
That's the guy, Adriana.

207
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:52,247
My uncle Tony.

208
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,866
The guy I'm going to hell for.

209
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,817
- Long Branch cops.
- What do you think?

210
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,288
Not your average bulls... detectives.

211
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:12,477
Call the Long Branch PD, find out what's up.

212
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,807
So, you all set?

213
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:26,965
- Don't look at me.
- Why? Ya look good!

214
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:29,959
And you're gonna look nice
with the short hair.

215
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:32,748
Like whatshername...

216
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:36,495
- That actress.
- Just take me home.

217
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:38,770
I can drop you off, but I really can't stay.

218
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,692
Why not?

219
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:51,708
All right, look. First off, like I said before,

220
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:54,655
as far as all the medical bills
and the prescriptions,

221
00:17:54,703 --> 00:17:56,734
that's covered, ad nauseam.

222
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:59,365
- You motherfucker.
- Hey, take it easy.

223
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,363
This is how you leave me?

224
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:05,469
I'm almost burned to death
cooking you a fucking snack?

225
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:08,105
You could've been making yourself something.

226
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:12,657
- Am I that fuckin' horrible now?
- No. You're not horrible at all.

227
00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:16,528
I'm going back to my wife.

228
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:18,478
You selfish fuck.

229
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,035
I hate you.

230
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:28,014
There's just no future with us,
I told you that from the get-go.

231
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:31,526
That's why I didn't want you hitching
your wagon to my star.

232
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:36,199
You'll heal up. You'll meet somebody else.

233
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,310
Fuck you!

234
00:18:40,914 --> 00:18:46,453
I didn't come here to fight, I came here to pick
you up and end this like a gentleman.

235
00:18:49,055 --> 00:18:51,007
I'm gonna fuckin' kill myself.

236
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,036
I gotta take this.

237
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,214
Is that you?

238
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,567
I know you're there, just say something.
Where the fuck are...?

239
00:19:14,315 --> 00:19:16,619
Your call cannot be...

240
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,401
- The Bing.
- Yeah, it's me.

241
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:29,794
Have your friend at the phone company
call me.

242
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,710
- Who, Gerard?
- I want to put traps on all my lines.

243
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:42,846
Jesus. What?

244
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:45,238
- We need to talk.
- I was buying medicine.

245
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:47,791
- This way, please.
- But my car!

246
00:20:06,992 --> 00:20:08,342
Hello?

247
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,174
Give me a hand, will you?

248
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:16,089
I got more stuff in the car, so...

249
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,797
- Where should I put it?
- In the bedroom.

250
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,945
Oh, you made it.
Hey, I was just starting dinner.

251
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:26,375
Yeah, it smells good.

252
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:35,153
- What is this?
- I got you something small.

253
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,108
Oh, this is beautiful!

254
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:42,978
With my black coat.

255
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,847
It's a Hermès. Supposed to be the best.

256
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:06,325
There's the whipped butter too, if you like.

257
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:07,960
This is all right.

258
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:16,218
This is fuckin' weird.

259
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:20,853
- AJ...
- No, he's right.

260
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:23,282
It is fuckin' weird.

261
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:28,236
You know what? We should celebrate.

262
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:34,421
Here, give me your glass.

263
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,931
The trick is, you gotta hold the cork,
don't let it fly out.

264
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:42,163
Gab's uncle got a detached retina

265
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,273
at his retirement party.
He never saw outta that eye again.

266
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,751
That's festive.

267
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,458
I wanna make a toast.

268
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,805
To the people I love.

269
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:01,913
Nothing else matters.

270
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:05,349
Hear, hear.

271
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:12,848
Slow down.

272
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:15,566
You're supposed to savour it.

273
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,796
It's important in life.

274
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:29,408
- Open the door for Mr Mucklel
- What?

275
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:33,044
- Open the door for Mr Muckle the blind man.
- Call 'em off my kumquatsl

276
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:35,074
- What'd you say?
- Kumquatsl

277
00:22:42,426 --> 00:22:45,933
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
It's all right. It's all right.

278
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:47,883
All right.

279
00:23:09,563 --> 00:23:12,672
- So?
- I was throwing the garbage out.

280
00:23:12,715 --> 00:23:18,016
So what? Isn't that illegal anyway,
to film people without telling 'em?

281
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,569
And the reason you didn't just leave
the garbage in the dumpster?

282
00:23:21,614 --> 00:23:24,520
Bills and stuff.
Our account numbers were on it.

283
00:23:26,044 --> 00:23:28,915
- Friend of yours?
- Jesus Christ.

284
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:30,988
His name is Gilbert Nieves.

285
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:34,698
Partial traces of an infrared stamp
on his hand from The Crazy Horse.

286
00:23:34,743 --> 00:23:36,059
I don't know him.

287
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,927
You told the police
that he was at the club that night.

288
00:23:38,974 --> 00:23:41,357
Let me ask you
a question, Miss La Cerva.

289
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:45,392
Do you really think we don't know
what's in that garbage bag?

290
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,026
He was stabbed in the club.

291
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:49,106
You tried to dispose of the evidence.

292
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,339
- I didn't do nothing.
- Miss La Cerva.

293
00:23:51,384 --> 00:23:54,336
I suggest in the strongest possible terms

294
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:56,761
that you start telling us what you know.

295
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:10,011
There's this guy, his name's Matush.

296
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,600
He's a drug dealer.
He did it. I swear, not me.

297
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:17,593
What's Matush's last name?

298
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:22,943
I don't know. He's foreign, the Mid East
or something... Pakistan.

299
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,860
Anyway, Christopher don't
let him deal in the club,

300
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:30,647
but once in a while he'd sell me
some X or whatever.

301
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,108
This is my friend Kamal.

302
00:24:37,116 --> 00:24:40,147
Listen, I need a favour.
We're trying to get an apartment.

303
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,096
I gotta fax a copy of my passport.

304
00:24:42,145 --> 00:24:47,366
- You can't go to Kinko's?
- The guy's waiting. Two seconds, I swear.

305
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:52,673
It's in the office, but hurry.
If Christopher sees you, he'll shit.

306
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,592
That's for you.

307
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:14,878
This guy was at the club, the dead guy,
but I never saw him before.

308
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:17,035
Matush said he sold him coke once,

309
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:20,187
but the guy said Matush
ripped him off, it was all laxative.

310
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,180
Oh, boy.

311
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,726
What's the number again?

312
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:28,995
Hey, yo, you can't be back here, man.

313
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:31,348
Cool out, yo! What are ya doing?

314
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:33,145
- Give me my money.
- What?

315
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:35,019
Don't get stupid in here.

316
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,893
Fuck off, I got no beef with you.

317
00:25:36,942 --> 00:25:40,685
You still sell that beat shit, huh?
Fuckin' baby powder?

318
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:42,762
- Look, I don't know...
- Get him!

319
00:25:42,806 --> 00:25:45,312
I'll kill you motherfuckers! I'll kill you!

320
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:26,518
Oh, my God!

321
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:32,579
We had to wait till later to get out
the mops and stuff,

322
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,688
after we closed up.

323
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:37,483
- If Christopher...
- Nobody has to know anything.

324
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,956
- But you don't fuckin' understand!
- It's cool, OK?

325
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,268
We'll take him out through the basement.

326
00:26:43,313 --> 00:26:45,378
Dump him in the ocean.

327
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:01,296
Why'd you help this Matush?

328
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:04,292
I wasn't helping him, I was afraid for myself.

329
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:08,474
Besides, he's nice. I don't know.
I didn't wanna see him get into trouble.

330
00:27:08,522 --> 00:27:11,902
- Sounds like a real sweetheart.
- The guy was gonna stab him!

331
00:27:11,952 --> 00:27:15,413
He's not a bad person. He's very religious.

332
00:27:15,462 --> 00:27:18,888
- Religious?
- He prays, like, all the time.

333
00:27:18,932 --> 00:27:21,915
He went through a period
of rediscovering his religion.

334
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:24,629
He don't even do drugs any more,
he just deals.

335
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:27,976
Every month he sends all
his money home to his family.

336
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:31,724
- In Pakistan?
- His brother runs a prep school.

337
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,044
Some place for young boys.

338
00:27:35,406 --> 00:27:37,152
I was very impressed with that.

339
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,779
He's buckled down.
He's much more serious as a person.

340
00:27:43,822 --> 00:27:47,961
- Does Christopher know what happened?
- No! Are you crazy?

341
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:52,626
You're guilty of obstructing an ongoing
investigation into a drug-related homicide.

342
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:54,786
You are looking at 25 years.

343
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,938
- But I didn't do nothing.
- Take your head out of your ass.

344
00:27:57,981 --> 00:28:02,485
- You knew what you were doing.
- We can arrest you now, have you charged,

345
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:05,115
send you over
to the women's house of detention.

346
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,383
Or in the alternative you can cooperate.

347
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:10,700
But I've been fuckin' cooperating!

348
00:28:10,745 --> 00:28:13,887
You've been giving us shit,
and I've had it!

349
00:28:13,936 --> 00:28:17,679
I want you wired up!
I want Tony Soprano on tape!

350
00:28:17,725 --> 00:28:21,423
- Your boyfriend too!
- No, I'm not doing it!

351
00:28:21,474 --> 00:28:23,188
Then you're all out of options!

352
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,327
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

353
00:28:30,448 --> 00:28:32,399
Fine, who's your lawyer?

354
00:28:32,443 --> 00:28:34,826
I don't have an official one.

355
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:39,697
- Maybe Christopher knows a good lawyer.
- Oh, you fuckin' piece of shit.

356
00:28:39,742 --> 00:28:43,009
I'll call the Public Defender,
they'll send someone down.

357
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:46,717
Might take awhile, though,
this hour of the night.

358
00:28:57,691 --> 00:28:59,915
I think I left some shoes over there.

359
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:05,181
I can iron these tomorrow.

360
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:08,769
- What for? Send 'em to the cleaners.
- I kinda miss it actually.

361
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:11,167
My wrist is getting weak.

362
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:17,786
- I could help you there.
- Get outta here.

363
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:23,367
No, let's give it some exercise.

364
00:29:23,418 --> 00:29:25,289
- What?
- Stop.

365
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:42,956
Hi, it's Ade. Ma, if this is you, another gift
for the registry could be a decanter.

366
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:45,748
It's me. Where are you?

367
00:29:54,888 --> 00:29:56,838
We may be doing it at our house.

368
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,185
We've only got the one leaf for 16 people.

369
00:29:59,236 --> 00:30:03,184
Could you do a buffet? Maybe set a card table
up for the kids?

370
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:06,128
It's our first holiday.
Ronnie wants us all together.

371
00:30:17,424 --> 00:30:21,009
Ade? It's been 40 minutes.
How long you gonna stay in there?

372
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:23,481
How long will you let me go
without a lawyer?

373
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:27,508
I told you, they're backed up.
We left four messages.

374
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:30,267
Eight fuckin' hours I've been here already.

375
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:50,203
- Jesus Christ, look at me.
- You want some coffee?

376
00:30:51,128 --> 00:30:52,999
I can't, my stomach.

377
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:58,342
I wish you'd think about our offer.
It's not a bad deal.

378
00:30:59,145 --> 00:31:03,887
I won't wear a wire, I told you. It's bad enough
how I betrayed him already.

379
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:07,312
It's not too late to have a future, Ade.
There are other options.

380
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,467
Don't start with
the Witness Protection again.

381
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:13,065
You love each other. You have your health.

382
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,296
Yeah, right.

383
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:18,210
Living like this
is what's costing you your insides.

384
00:31:20,684 --> 00:31:25,109
- I really need a cigarette.
- OK. Come on.

385
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,499
There's no way she'll wear a wire,
but she might get Moltisanti to flip.

386
00:32:08,547 --> 00:32:10,736
- Why now?
- Problems with Tony.

387
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:14,082
- Christopher hates him.
- That's confirmed by wiretaps.

388
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:18,114
Cl12 mentioned it too. Something to do
with Tony Blundetto, the cousin.

389
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,985
- What would Moltisanti want?
- I'm not sure.

390
00:32:21,032 --> 00:32:24,980
- He's got some interest in screenwriting.
- Put in a call to Sam Goldwyn.

391
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:26,574
Promise her anything?

392
00:32:26,616 --> 00:32:31,393
Depending on what he's offering, maybe
immunity and relocation for the two of them.

393
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:39,373
She's got to understand
that if she won't wear a wire,

394
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,007
we can't offer her protection or surveillance.

395
00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:45,116
- I explained all that.
- She's got till 9am Monday

396
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:48,941
to bring him in or we turn her over
to Long Branch PD.

397
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,086
Tone, you got a call.

398
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:58,636
Jimmy Petrille, Brooklyn.

399
00:33:01,198 --> 00:33:03,070
- Hello.
- It's me.

400
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:06,176
That tennis match with those guys?
My guy won.

401
00:33:06,223 --> 00:33:08,254
- Oh, yeah?
- The other one, the son.

402
00:33:08,298 --> 00:33:10,248
- He dropped out.
- What, he got hurt?

403
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:12,560
Nothing like that. Settled, that's all.

404
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:14,477
All right.

405
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:21,012
- Little Carmine's out.
- He's dead?

406
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:24,044
Seems like him and Johnny worked out a deal.

407
00:33:24,092 --> 00:33:27,201
I knew he'd cave. He's a fuckin' pussy, that kid.

408
00:33:27,763 --> 00:33:30,473
Johnny Sack, boss of a family.

409
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:35,480
Time was it would've been great
for us to have John as the boss.

410
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:38,872
Smart as a fuckin' whip.
He used to be a pragmatist.

411
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:41,896
Some people are better at being number twos.

412
00:33:41,943 --> 00:33:45,003
You thought John had an ego before?
Forget it now.

413
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,245
- Did you sleep?
- A little.

414
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:08,947
- So where the fuck you been?
- Christopher, we need to talk.

415
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:12,414
- I asked you a question, Adriana.
- I know.

416
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:14,519
There's something I need to tell you.

417
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:17,310
- It's that fuckin' Bobby DeMarco?
- No!

418
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:19,418
Please, Christopher.

419
00:34:21,698 --> 00:34:23,806
I gotta get through this.

420
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:30,295
About a year ago...

421
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:32,767
more maybe, I don't know...

422
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,986
- I was arrested.
- For what? What are you talking about?

423
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:41,453
- For drugs.
- Where, at the club?

424
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:46,785
- You remember my friend Danielle?
- She set you up?

425
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,418
She was an FBI agent, Christopher.

426
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:06,111
She lied to me. They wanted
to arrest you too, Christopher.

427
00:35:06,154 --> 00:35:08,738
I was just trying to protect you.

428
00:35:08,783 --> 00:35:12,680
They said all they wanted was some
information and they would leave us alone.

429
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:16,228
I didn't tell them nothing, I swear to God...

430
00:35:16,273 --> 00:35:19,457
Just licence plates, some other stupid shit.

431
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,604
They wanted me to wear a wire,
but I wouldn't do it.

432
00:35:22,646 --> 00:35:28,809
But now there was a murder, Christopher,
and they know about it.

433
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,678
At the club, Matush and some other guy.

434
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:38,615
I tried to cover it up, but I had no choice.

435
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,243
They've been filming us in the parking lot.

436
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:56,859
We're dead, you know that?

437
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:02,116
What did you do, huh?
How could you fuckin' do this to us?

438
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,722
I fuckin' loved you!

439
00:36:18,574 --> 00:36:20,557
I'm sorry.

440
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,312
My God!

441
00:36:39,568 --> 00:36:41,947
What are we gonna do?

442
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:54,298
Careful here, my son.

443
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:10,798
- Hello.
- T, it's me.

444
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:12,985
You awake?

445
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,483
I know you're mad, OK?

446
00:37:19,163 --> 00:37:21,747
I'm sorry.
When I heard about Angelo I just...

447
00:37:21,793 --> 00:37:23,775
Don't say it. Not on the phone.

448
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,772
I know, I won't.

449
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,229
- What should I do?
- I'll tell you what not to do.

450
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:35,532
- That's come back around here.
- I know.

451
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:38,600
I know, but... my kids, my boys.

452
00:37:38,643 --> 00:37:40,591
Don't worry. I'll look after them.

453
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:43,659
Yeah, well, that's...
that's why I'm calling, to ask...

454
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:46,205
Sure, why not?

455
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:50,033
Anything else I can do for you?

456
00:37:50,075 --> 00:37:52,737
I don't know what to say, cuz.

457
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:54,812
I'm leaving you with shit in your lap.

458
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:05,212
- Hello?
- The night you went away,

459
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:07,359
you know, 17 years ago,

460
00:38:07,403 --> 00:38:11,585
I told you that I got jumped
by a couple of shines.

461
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:15,362
That's why I didn't show.

462
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,793
It was all bullshit.

463
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:23,445
I got in a fight with my mother and passed out.

464
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:27,743
- What do you mean?
- I don't know. It was like a panic attack.

465
00:38:27,784 --> 00:38:32,705
I went down like a house of cards
and I cracked my fuckin' skull open.

466
00:38:32,755 --> 00:38:34,780
Why are you telling me all this?

467
00:38:34,824 --> 00:38:38,556
I felt guilty about it all these years,
like it was my fault you went away.

468
00:38:43,216 --> 00:38:45,320
Anyway, now we're even.

469
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,621
So the casino, all that shit you did
for me is cos of that?

470
00:38:53,636 --> 00:38:56,973
You just take care of yourself, all right?

471
00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:58,837
You too.

472
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,490
Hello?

473
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:19,518
Gerard, it's me.

474
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:24,410
- He just called.
- Give me a sec, I'll dump the line.

475
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:29,502
- You got a pen?
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

476
00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:34,390
He's at Roy's. It's a business, Kinderhook,
New York. That's upstate.

477
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:38,770
Yeah, I know where it is. Thanks.

478
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:55,793
- Hello?
- Uncle Pat.

479
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:59,525
- How's life at the old folks' home?
- I don't like the people here.

480
00:39:59,576 --> 00:40:03,432
- Do you know what time it is?
- I thought you were a night owl.

481
00:40:04,388 --> 00:40:07,443
Did I hear a rumour there was a problem
up there at the farm?

482
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,941
The goddamn developer.
Some environmental crap.

483
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:15,006
They can't start the demolition
without some special permit.

484
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:17,705
And the house is sitting there empty,
damn it.

485
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,410
Remember that... that time at Lake George,

486
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:24,094
how you loved it?

487
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:27,047
We could live someplace like that, maybe.

488
00:40:27,095 --> 00:40:31,133
- You could start writing again.
- I could do my memoirs, finally.

489
00:40:32,894 --> 00:40:35,691
And we'd have a fireplace like you like too.

490
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,168
We could never come back here, Adriana.

491
00:40:39,213 --> 00:40:42,363
I don't wanna come back. I just want you.

492
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:44,801
You couldn't even see your mother again.

493
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,207
You want some eggs?

494
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:56,279
I need to clear my head.

495
00:40:58,649 --> 00:41:01,720
- You didn't even sleep.
- This is a lot to process.

496
00:41:01,768 --> 00:41:05,362
I gotta think. I'll be back in a little while.

497
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:06,726
Stay, wait.

498
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:09,280
I'm gonna get cigarettes. I'll be right back.

499
00:41:09,327 --> 00:41:11,396
Smoke mine. Don't smoke.

500
00:41:11,446 --> 00:41:15,677
- Next you're gonna want a vodka.
- What? Come on.

501
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:19,555
I love you, baby.

502
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:21,640
I love you.

503
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:42,159
Hello.

504
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,112
- He wants to do it.
- Great, when are you coming in?

505
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,673
A couple hours.
We'll get some things together.

506
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:49,596
That's not what we said, Ade.

507
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:52,994
Please, if I push him he'll say no.
I know how he is.

508
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:59,028
I'm serious, Adriana. You've got till one o'clock.

509
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:06,977
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me.

510
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:10,662
Look, everything's OK.

511
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:15,419
Jesus, I don't even know how to say this.

512
00:43:16,781 --> 00:43:19,852
It's Christopher. He tried to commit suicide.

513
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,733
- My God, is he all right?
- He's fine.

514
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:26,215
He was up by Ramapo,
apparently he took some pills.

515
00:43:26,259 --> 00:43:28,773
A trooper found him in a bathroom of this diner.

516
00:43:28,818 --> 00:43:30,730
They brought him to the hospital.

517
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:33,087
His mom's on her way up there now.

518
00:43:33,138 --> 00:43:35,093
Did he say anything to you?

519
00:43:35,137 --> 00:43:37,697
I mean, did he appear suicidal?

520
00:43:37,737 --> 00:43:39,886
- No.
- Are you sure?

521
00:43:40,956 --> 00:43:43,515
His mom said he's
very upset about something.

522
00:43:44,995 --> 00:43:47,348
Anyway, I'm on my way up there now.

523
00:43:47,393 --> 00:43:49,986
I'm gonna send Sil by to pick you up then, OK?

524
00:43:50,032 --> 00:43:52,499
- Jesus Christ.
- You know he's been drinking.

525
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:55,428
He's probably fighting that heroin urge again.

526
00:43:56,149 --> 00:43:58,583
- Anyway, Sil's on his way.
- OK.

527
00:43:58,629 --> 00:44:01,903
All right. I'll see ya up there.

528
00:44:51,286 --> 00:44:54,880
I'd stop to eat, but I don't wanna
get to the hospital after Tony.

529
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:56,880
I'm not hungry.

530
00:45:11,038 --> 00:45:14,393
They'll keep him a few days, maybe.

531
00:45:14,436 --> 00:45:17,552
Observation, do some tests,

532
00:45:17,595 --> 00:45:19,789
who knows?

533
00:45:45,463 --> 00:45:48,055
He's a strong kid.

534
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:52,609
He's tough, very resilient.

535
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:09,532
Why are you crying? He's gonna be fine.

536
00:46:49,436 --> 00:46:51,869
- No, please!
- Come on. Come on.

537
00:46:51,915 --> 00:46:53,870
- Where you fuckin' going?
- Please!

538
00:46:53,914 --> 00:46:56,710
Come on, come on! Fuckin' cunt!

539
00:46:56,752 --> 00:46:58,708
- Please! No.
- Come out of there.

540
00:48:07,563 --> 00:48:10,473
This is long-term parking only.

541
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:15,752
Due to increased security,
cars being reclaimed in less than 14 days

542
00:48:15,799 --> 00:48:19,154
must be left in lots L, M or N.

543
00:48:20,437 --> 00:48:23,269
This is long-term parking only.

544
00:48:23,316 --> 00:48:28,751
Due to increased security,
cars being reclaimed in less than 14 days

545
00:48:28,794 --> 00:48:32,262
must be left in lots L, M or N.

546
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:45,661
The King of New York.

547
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:50,974
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Tony.

548
00:48:51,024 --> 00:48:53,218
You deserve it.

549
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:59,410
I want you to know this is the last time
we'll meet like this. It's undignified.

550
00:49:05,098 --> 00:49:08,771
So, what's the word on your cousin?

551
00:49:15,654 --> 00:49:18,008
I think I know where he's holed up.

552
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,406
And?

553
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:25,044
I know this has to be done, John,

554
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,478
but I'm asking you now as a friend.

555
00:49:29,888 --> 00:49:33,481
- Let me handle this myself.
- I can't do that, Tony.

556
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:39,440
You can do whatever the fuck you want,
you're the fuckin' boss.

557
00:49:39,484 --> 00:49:41,553
I choose not to, then.

558
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:51,910
I want your promise it'll be quick.

559
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:54,710
I'm not gonna lie to you, Tony, I don't have to.

560
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:58,032
Phil's gonna do it, and he'll do it his way.

561
00:50:02,274 --> 00:50:06,231
This is me now. Come on.

562
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:09,661
Anything else?

563
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:14,660
No.

564
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,175
You know what, John? I'll give you undignified.

565
00:50:40,018 --> 00:50:41,575
Go fuck yourself.

566
00:50:42,777 --> 00:50:44,573
You and Phil and whoever.

567
00:50:46,735 --> 00:50:48,452
He's my fuckin' cousin.

568
00:51:26,238 --> 00:51:30,230
- You all right?
- This is some funny shit.

569
00:51:35,154 --> 00:51:37,110
What the fuck is wrong with you?

570
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:45,266
I snorted a little H.

571
00:51:48,428 --> 00:51:50,703
I know, but...

572
00:51:51,907 --> 00:51:55,501
I can't stand the pain. I loved her.

573
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,573
Fuckin' pain, huh?

574
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:08,655
You think you're alone in this?

575
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,452
It was a judgment call. She sounded OK.

576
00:52:11,499 --> 00:52:13,216
The status on Moltisanti?

577
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:15,488
Seen yesterday leaving the Bing with Tony.

578
00:52:15,538 --> 00:52:18,209
- Should we bring him in?
- That'll get us nothing.

579
00:52:18,256 --> 00:52:22,009
She really could have fled.
She could be in China by now.

580
00:52:35,888 --> 00:52:37,924
How should we handle the Nieves murder?

581
00:52:37,968 --> 00:52:39,878
We have the terror possibility.

582
00:52:39,927 --> 00:52:42,565
Take it over from the Long Branch PD.

583
00:53:28,386 --> 00:53:30,660
Well, what did I say, is it beautiful?

584
00:53:34,663 --> 00:53:36,699
Yeah, it's a gorgeous piece of land.

585
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:41,574
With this view, it's well worth 600,000.

586
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,087
The surveyor's coming on Tuesday.

587
00:54:02,932 --> 00:54:05,842
- You all right?
- Yeah. Me? Yeah.

588
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,485
Absolutely.
