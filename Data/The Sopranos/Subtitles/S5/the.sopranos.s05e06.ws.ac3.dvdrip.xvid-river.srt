1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,400
# You woke up
this morning #

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,900
# Got yourself a gun #

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,750
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

4
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:22,500
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

5
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:24,765
# You've got
to burn to shine #

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,800
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

7
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:30,567
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

8
00:00:30,602 --> 00:00:33,300
# When you
woke up this morning #

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,400
# And all that love
had gone #

10
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:39,400
# Your papa never
told you about #

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,900
# Right and wrong #

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,300
# But you're...
you're lookin' good, baby #

13
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,817
# I believe that
you're feelin' fine #

14
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:49,300
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,865
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,100
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,700
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,700
# Woke up this morning #

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,000
# You say you woke up
this morning #

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,165
# The world
turned upside down #

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,400
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,765
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,200
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

24
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:18,600
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,700
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

26
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:24,700
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

27
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:27,665
# Woke up
this morning #

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,865
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,900
- # Woke up this morning #
- # Got yourself a gun #

30
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:36,400
- # Uh-huh #
- # Got yourself a gun. #

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,700
What the fuck?

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,100
Aw, shit!

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,565
So, Bundino,

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,265
why you fuck me
like this?

35
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,165
What the fuck you
talkin' about?

36
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,965
I got a whole leg
covered with Neosporin.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I just spent an hour with the cops
explainin' how it went down.

38
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,365
I no forget you
professional criminal.

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,500
Let me ask you somethin'.
If I really wanted to rob you,

40
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:47,700
you think I'd have to put
up with this bullshit?

41
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,100
Well, just so you know.

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,465
I didn't take
your truck.

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,900
I lost my study guide,
my fuckin' flashcards.

44
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,900
I'm sick of this fuckin'
prejudice against ex-cons.

45
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:05,400
I never hire you if I no need
Tony Soprano for union.

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,000
Not for him, I show
you the fucking window.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,400
Great.

48
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,400
Hey, I thought you
liked the other one.

49
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:21,500
The Corn Pops.
Here, take it.

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,565
What, no juice either?

51
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,165
I told you,
write it down.

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,365
I'll have the girl
pick up whatever you want.

53
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,500
She doesn't know the difference between
fruit roll-ups and Pop-Tarts.

54
00:03:31,535 --> 00:03:33,465
I know, everybody's
an idiot to you.

55
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,000
You know they got
these places called supermarkets

56
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:38,500
where you go, and you buy
the things that you like.

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll reimburse you.

58
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,300
And when am I
supposed to do that?

59
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,600
Well, as far as I can tell,
you spend most of your time on the phone

60
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,700
or sittin' on the couch perfecting
that pissy look on your face.

61
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:51,900
Add coming home drunk,
sounds like you.

62
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,000
- What the fuck did you say to me?
- Let the fuck go of me.

63
00:03:58,035 --> 00:03:59,765
Or what?
Or what?

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,700
One of these days,
you wait,

65
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:03,600
I'm gonna kick
your fuckin' ass.

66
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,800
What's wrong with
right now then, huh?

67
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,800
What's wrong with right now?
Come on!

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Blah.

69
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,200
Now you got nothin'.

70
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,700
# Angels sent you #

71
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,900
# I've searched
everywhere #

72
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:44,400
# Just to find someone... #

73
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,765
- Thank you, Mary.
- You're welcome.

74
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,900
I hated to call you in but I got
this midterm report

75
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:56,000
from Mr. Fiske,
Anthony's English teacher.

76
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,800
And, uh, well, it doesn't hit the mail
for a few days

77
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:01,900
and I thought maybe
we could get a jump on it

78
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,900
and avert any real crisis.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,600
Wonderful,
another crisis.

80
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,550
He's still well below
the C average

81
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:09,400
he needs for the colleges
we discussed.

82
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,600
There is also an issue

83
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,000
with his five
paragraph essay.

84
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,565
"Animal Farm"?

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,400
Anthony submitted
his one-line topic late.

86
00:05:20,435 --> 00:05:22,000
Then two drafts.

87
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,050
The first was
apparently sketchy.

88
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:28,000
The second,
Fiske said, was...

89
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:30,300
"suspiciously cogent. "

90
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,365
Plagiarism.

91
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,765
He thinks
my son cheated?

92
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,000
He spent almost an entire Saturday
afternoon at the library.

93
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:42,200
- I think it's obvious what's going on.
- What do you mean?

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,200
Anyone else shows sudden
improvement, he gets a gold star.

95
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:46,900
My son gets
his act together

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
and suddenly
he's a cheater?

97
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:50,465
I know what
people think, Bob.

98
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,100
Italian-American, father
in the carting industry...

99
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,900
Are you suggesting
some sort of bias?

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,765
Because that's
a very serious charge.

101
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,665
I have met this Mr. Fiske.
He's a cold fish.

102
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,300
Couldn't you or one
of the other teachers talk to him?

103
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,100
Tell him how hard
AJ's trying?

104
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,800
Nothing will make
a better argument

105
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,167
than continued effort
on AJ's part.

106
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:13,465
But hey, there...
there's still a shot.

107
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,500
This semester's grade
is heavily weighted on their term paper

108
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:19,500
- on "Lord of the Flies. "
- My stomach is in knots.

109
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,200
That's why I thought it important
that you come in.

110
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,200
Though it...

111
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,700
did take me about an hour
to decide what to wear.

112
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:38,965
Me too.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,100
Does that mean
you've thought about my dinner offer?

114
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,765
I probably
shouldn't say this

115
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,400
but I have thought
about nothing else since you called.

116
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,365
Well, we can't do justice

117
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,000
to any discussion of "Madame Bovary"
over the phone.

118
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,700
That's the thing though.
That book was way over my head.

119
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,500
Why would you even be interested
in someone like me?

120
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,350
Because of just that.
I mean, who admits this stuff?

121
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:05,100
Not only are you very attractive,
you're unpretentious,

122
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:07,317
- you say what's on your mind.
- So a big mouth.

123
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:09,500
I see how that would
attract a man like you.

124
00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:12,500
So, should we grab
a meal or not?

125
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,265
Well, there are other things
to think about. My husband for one.

126
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,600
Your husband's gonna have to get used
to the idea that your life is moving on.

127
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm not worried
about my life.

128
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:25,465
Oh!

129
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,165
You know what?
Call me naive,

130
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,100
but in this day and age
I don't really think your husband...

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,800
if he found out... is going to break
his son's teacher's legs.

132
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,565
Not to mention
how that would play

133
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,800
in the admissions office
at Arizona State.

134
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,900
I don't get it.
What's so funny about that?

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
Honey, aren't you gonna
eat something?

136
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,065
Janice made lasagna.

137
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,800
It's not so great but you need
something on your stomach.

138
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:59,900
We're gonna go.
Got to stop at my mother's.

139
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:01,900
Gwen just told us
how you met.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,200
They let you use
the internet in the can?

141
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,000
They let you
post an ad.

142
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,900
I got to read some of that shit.
I bet it's hysterical.

143
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:11,765
He's, uh...

144
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,200
trying to concentrate.

145
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,600
"Vascular Physiology. "

146
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,800
"Neurotomy. "

147
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:21,800
Shit.

148
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,165
T made it out like
it was a big gym test.

149
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,000
Some people don't realize
what massage involves.

150
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm practically doin' two years
of medical school on my own right now.

151
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,000
One thing I learned
in recovery,

152
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:33,900
other people's
definitions of you,

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
sometimes they're more
about makin' themselves feel better.

154
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:38,800
You got to define
yourself.

155
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,800
Keep your eye
on the tiger, man.

156
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,900
- See you, Tony.
- Bye.

157
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,000
I suppose I could speak
with Monsignor Bava,

158
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:51,965
have him call
his nephew at Kmart.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,265
That'll fix us in
the Huggies department.

160
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,600
Well, the diaper drive
covers "Clothe the naked. "

161
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,565
What do you say we
work on "Feed the hungry"?

162
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,500
- This looks delicious.
- Thanks for inviting me, Carm.

163
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:04,500
Pleasant surprise,
indeed.

164
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,050
So, how goes life
these days?

165
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:11,442
Actually, I think
I met somebody.

166
00:09:11,477 --> 00:09:14,765
- Really?
- Just kind of happened.

167
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,600
We had been working
on this project together

168
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:20,167
and suddenly
we both realized

169
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:22,700
that there were
certain feelings.

170
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
And I like him
as a person too, of course.

171
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,800
Don't get me wrong.

172
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,200
The funny thing is,
I was sure he was gay.

173
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:32,600
He sort of reminded
me of you.

174
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,300
He's an intellectual.
You know what I mean?

175
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,817
Anyway, we had been
friends, I guess,

176
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:41,265
and then he called
to ask me out.

177
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,700
And suddenly
all the formality dropped away.

178
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:47,100
When I saw him
the other day,

179
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,300
he looked at me
with this intensity.

180
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,665
Now I know it's wrong,

181
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,400
but the truth is,
I feel it too.

182
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,465
You know, if you really
want to discuss this,

183
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,400
I think we should include Tony
in the conversation as well.

184
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Why are you sounding,
I don't know, kind of hostile?

185
00:10:07,335 --> 00:10:09,200
I'm not.

186
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,200
Perhaps that's
your sin talking.

187
00:10:12,235 --> 00:10:14,065
This is none of
Tony's business.

188
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,300
Who knows what he's been up to, and not
just during the separation either.

189
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:20,500
That doesn't change the fact you made
a commitment to each other before God.

190
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:23,600
Maybe you should send the papal nuncio
to Tony and remind him of that.

191
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:26,300
Why am I the only one held
to any kind of standards?

192
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,417
And for that matter,
if this is wrong,

193
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:30,500
why did God put
this man in my life?

194
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,300
Is it God that
put him there?

195
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,200
Or is there a particular
need you have right now?

196
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,200
See, I never
understand this.

197
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,700
Didn't He put
the need there?

198
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,700
Say when, señor.

199
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
You!
Office!

200
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,400
5:15, I haven't
punched in yet.

201
00:11:01,435 --> 00:11:03,000
This is still
my time.

202
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,365
Yeah?

203
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,000
I give you a hard time
about my truck the other day.

204
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:19,700
Cops find two kids...

205
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,500
Feel free to apologize
any time.

206
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,400
Anyway, they investigate.

207
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,100
Could be joyride.

208
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,700
But I think maybe
behind it

209
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,465
is my cousin
in the north side.

210
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,700
- You know if they found my books?
- Who knows?

211
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,950
You study hard
for massage, yeah?

212
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:41,300
The licensing test
is pretty hard.

213
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:43,065
Huge failure rate.

214
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
If you pass, then what
you do with this?

215
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,765
Be a professional masseur.

216
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,100
You no think of
massage "kageh"?

217
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:53,300
You know,
small sauna.

218
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,100
Yeah, I could see it.

219
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,000
Four or five tables,
soothing atmosphere.

220
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,265
Pipe in a little
Keith Jarrett.

221
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,800
First thing, I get
stuck with you. I think,

222
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,965
"Oh, shit. God damn it.

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He lazy American
and criminal.

224
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,365
No good for Kim. "

225
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,100
But you work
for Kim and future.

226
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,400
Like Korean people.

227
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,317
I wouldn't say that.

228
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:19,165
I come from Korea.

229
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,400
Only new shoes
and uncle's address.

230
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:25,100
Worse than prison.

231
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,900
But I become
"jah-soo-suhng-gah," the boss.

232
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:31,265
That's why I try
to help you.

233
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,400
Help me how?
What are you talking about?

234
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:37,500
I stake you the money
in a storefront.

235
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,965
I got a travel agency

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,165
in mini-mall over
at West Caldwell.

237
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,800
Shitty business with
a fucking three-year lease.

238
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,965
You know, my daughter,

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,800
very interested in massage.

240
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,500
Physical therapy.
Top two-thirds class.

241
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,200
Good for her.
It's a tough nut to crack.

242
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:07,800
She no like physical
therapy no more.

243
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,165
Cripple people
make her sad.

244
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,100
Now, she watch TV,
live at home, do nothing.

245
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:18,000
You pass test then you,
me, my daughter,

246
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,600
we make the big
success journey.

247
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:22,400
Okay?

248
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,600
Jesus.

249
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Yeah, all right.

250
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,400
I don't know
what to say, Kim.

251
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,300
Thanks.

252
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,100
I laid it out for him.
He wants to move back here.

253
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,100
- It's got to be with your approval.
- This was your idea?

254
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,165
It was mutual.

255
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,000
He's upset 'cause you don't get
the kind of cereal he likes.

256
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,300
He threw it in the sink.
How am I supposed to focus

257
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,850
at school with no breakfast?
I got dizzy.

258
00:13:57,885 --> 00:14:00,300
I'm sorry.
I don't see why the two of you

259
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,300
can't work this out
between yourselves.

260
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,500
Well maybe I don't
want to live

261
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,350
in a place where people
use violence against children.

262
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:10,100
Violence? You're lucky I didn't
put my shoe up your ass.

263
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,565
You see? Now that's abuse.
I know what my rights are.

264
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,400
I can call social services
and they'll send a case worker.

265
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:17,400
Go ahead!
He'll get the other shoe!

266
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,365
- This is demoralizin'.
- Well, now maybe you see...

267
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,600
That a son of mine would even consider
callin' in the authorities!

268
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,500
- Go ahead, live where you want.
- Fine.

269
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,700
Family meeting?

270
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,600
- Try to stay awake, AJ.
- Keep walkin'.

271
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,465
I just want
my old room back.

272
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,200
You wanted to live with your father.
Live with your decision.

273
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,400
- I don't like it there.
- Funny, I thought I was the problem.

274
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,000
- I make you miserable, remember?
- I never said that.

275
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,600
- You did.
- Absolutely.

276
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,865
For me to even consider
having you back,

277
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,100
we're gonna have to establish
some non-negotiable ground rules.

278
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:08,500
- Like what kind?
- Let your mother talk.

279
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,300
First and foremost,
school comes first.

280
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,300
That means putting the brakes
on your social life...

281
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:18,600
parties, phone calls,
Devin.

282
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,465
You are at a crisis point
grade-wise,

283
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,400
so you will make sure that your work
is done on time and correctly.

284
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,000
All right.

285
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,265
I will not tolerate
cursing.

286
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,900
After 16 years of uninterrupted potty
mouth from you people, I get slammed?

287
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,100
This is my house.
You will treat me with respect.

288
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,100
Is that it?

289
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,100
I want you to involve me
in your life a little.

290
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,300
All right, fine.

291
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,300
All right.
Go get your stuff from the car.

292
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,900
We played
that just right.

293
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
I think his time
over there with me

294
00:16:31,235 --> 00:16:33,200
whipped him
into shape a little.

295
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:35,165
Hmm.

296
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,800
I think you'll see
a difference.

297
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,300
Which muscles attach
to the coracoid process?

298
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:53,800
Okay, I fucking
know this.

299
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,250
It's on the tip
of my tongue.

300
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:58,600
Oh, fucking study
hall again.

301
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,100
Vito, where the fuck
is my Tupperware?

302
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Keep your shirt on. My wife's bringing
it down this afternoon.

303
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:07,800
Pectoralis minor
and the coracobrachialis, of course.

304
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,600
And?

305
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,300
- Come on. Even I know this.
- Fuck, fine, what is it?

306
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,865
- Biceps!
- What the fuck?

307
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,100
Oh, fuck, I knew that.
My mind's all over the place.

308
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,765
Fear knocked at the door.
Faith answered.

309
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,100
- There was no one there.
- Why do you want to do this shit?

310
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:26,800
So you can touch
a bunch a strangers?

311
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,600
You really skeeve
the human body, don't you?

312
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,000
You like this so much,
let me ask you a question.

313
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
Why do pissing,
shitting and fucking

314
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,865
all happen within
a two-inch radius?

315
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Everybody asks that, Paulie.
There's no answer for it.

316
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:39,400
They're all sources
of pleasure, though.

317
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:41,000
Get the fuck out of here!

318
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,300
I know this shit and then
the next minute it's gone.

319
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:45,100
I don't know how you
do it working full time.

320
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,065
If your parole
officer's a problem,

321
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,465
give our guy Jimmy Curran a call.
He's a supervisor.

322
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,300
It's not that. It's all this pressure
now that I got this opportunity.

323
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:55,000
Sungyon Kim, my boss,

324
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,900
he's going to back me on
a whole storefront operation.

325
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
The Korean?

326
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,800
You're looking for money,
why not come to me?

327
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,865
Well, this is different.

328
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,065
This self-owned
business shit

329
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,450
is like a religion
to these people.

330
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:11,800
Plus, the guy sees
something in me.

331
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,600
You know, in some ways,

332
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,700
the whole prison thing
is not that different

333
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:21,900
from being an immigrant.

334
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,700
Word to the wise:
remember Pearl Harbor.

335
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,500
We really were
the last people in there.

336
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,465
At least they were
subtle about it.

337
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,000
Was it the stacking
the chairs or running the vacuum?

338
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,450
Relax.

339
00:18:53,485 --> 00:18:55,300
Sorry.

340
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,250
"Madame Bovary. "

341
00:18:58,285 --> 00:18:59,865
It's a first edition.

342
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
Well, Modern Library's
first edition.

343
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Thank you.
That is so sweet.

344
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,700
Honestly, though,
I don't know.

345
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,400
The story's very slow.

346
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,965
Nothing really happens.

347
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,300
I think he could've
said what he has to say

348
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,800
- with a lot less words.
- Outside nothing happens.

349
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,100
But inside she has these extremes
of boredom

350
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,265
and exhilaration.

351
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,300
You should
try it again.

352
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,465
And what a wonderful thing
to have in a den.

353
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,200
You know, you look really
beautiful in this light.

354
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,300
I don't do this a lot.

355
00:19:39,335 --> 00:19:40,700
Do what?

356
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,550
Sitting in a car,
with a man,

357
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:47,100
not really knowing
what to do,

358
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:50,000
or if I should at all.

359
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,200
And feeling like
some teenager

360
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,000
which was,
believe it or not...

361
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,465
I have to tell you.

362
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,700
I haven't been
with anyone.

363
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,665
You're a virgin?

364
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,900
This is my
lucky night.

365
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:20,100
Stop with the jokes.

366
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,700
I'm so glad
you're here.

367
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
So, how was it?

368
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,800
Oh, cut it out.

369
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,500
So, what is "Abelard
and Heloise"?

370
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:25,200
It looks religious.

371
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,000
I just like
to read in there.

372
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,700
It's the classic story.

373
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,100
A 12th century scholar
falls in love with his underage student,

374
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:38,200
gets her pregnant.

375
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,100
God, in the 12th century?

376
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
And they're found out.

377
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,000
And her uncle, the abbot,
has him castrated.

378
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,665
It's timeless, really.

379
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,165
Even though he becomes
a monk and she a nun,

380
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,600
their passion burns on through
these incredible letters

381
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,600
through the rest
of their lives.

382
00:22:57,635 --> 00:23:00,500
You, with these books.

383
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,700
Education should
never stop.

384
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,400
It enriches
all aspects of life.

385
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,400
Hmm, I know.

386
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,165
I wish someone could
convince AJ of that.

387
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,865
I keep thinking he could
start over in college

388
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,300
but who knows if he's even
going to get the chance?

389
00:23:17,335 --> 00:23:20,400
He will.
All our students matriculate.

390
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,900
You got to be fucking kidding me.
No way!

391
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,600
Why do they take so long?
All they have to do

392
00:24:57,635 --> 00:24:59,700
is spit out the results.

393
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,200
5-6-2-4-7-

394
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:04,600
3-7-32-11.

395
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,765
That's me.
Blundetto.

396
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,600
I'm only authorized
to inform you that your score

397
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:12,400
meets or exceeds
the required minimum for licensure.

398
00:25:12,435 --> 00:25:14,900
And you're now board
certified in massage

399
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and body work by
the state of New Jersey.

400
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,000
Honey, you passed.

401
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,600
You passed!

402
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Oh Jesus.

403
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,800
I couldn't have
done it alone.

404
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,700
Oh my God,
look at you.

405
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,900
You did it, baby.

406
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:39,865
You did it.

407
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,400
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

408
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,200
It's been a month since
my last confession.

409
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:49,900
- Carmela?
- I had sex with that man.

410
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,550
I know we talked
about commitment,

411
00:25:57,585 --> 00:26:00,600
the sacrament
of marriage, but...

412
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,965
I don't know.

413
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,200
- You sound remorseful.
- I am.

414
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:08,965
I'm also confused,
though.

415
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,300
The truth is I have been
walking around on a cloud,

416
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:13,100
like Maria in
"West Side Story. "

417
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,565
It's not right.

418
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,000
Have you heard of
"Abelard and Eloise"?

419
00:26:23,035 --> 00:26:24,865
I think it's "Heloise. "

420
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
And from what I remember
it ends badly.

421
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,965
I know, exactly.

422
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,400
But, something in me
has been reawakened.

423
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,700
And even if it never
happens again with this man,

424
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:39,017
just knowing that
feeling of passion again,

425
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:41,876
I don't know
if it's ever going to go away.

426
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:44,700
- I'll need it.
- If it never happens again?

427
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:47,017
Carmela, I can't
absolve you of a sin

428
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:49,300
you're going
to continue to commit.

429
00:26:49,335 --> 00:26:51,567
You need to show
resolve,

430
00:26:51,602 --> 00:26:53,851
a firm purpose
to change.

431
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:56,100
Yeah, I know,
I know.

432
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,200
So, this man takes
you to restaurants,

433
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,900
fulfills certain
physical desires,

434
00:27:01,935 --> 00:27:03,665
tells jokes.

435
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,100
But will he be there
beyond the here and now?

436
00:27:06,135 --> 00:27:08,500
When you're too old
to walk to the bathroom,

437
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,650
will he be there
to help you?

438
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:12,700
What, and you
think Tony will?

439
00:27:12,735 --> 00:27:15,100
Carmela,
you took a vow.

440
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,665
You both did.

441
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,000
For your penance, I want you
to do something kind for Tony.

442
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:23,900
- I don't think I can, Father.
- Then pray for him,

443
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,500
not only that God
will touch his heart

444
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,400
but that He'll
touch yours as well.

445
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,400
It's not much now,
but it's a pretty flexible space.

446
00:27:42,435 --> 00:27:44,300
Plus you got the dog
groomer next door

447
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,300
in case your Korean
friend wants some lunch.

448
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:48,265
You know they
really do eat dogs.

449
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,300
- Not all of them but I asked Kim.
- Jesus Christ.

450
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
I'm thinking of building
a row of rooms here

451
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
with different themes.
Asian for shiatsu,

452
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,000
a little Danish
thing for Rolfing,

453
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,900
even though technically
it's Swedish.

454
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,700
Well, sounds like
it's all coming together.

455
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,700
Look, Ton', I know
you're disappointed.

456
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,700
What the fuck you
talking about?

457
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
The way things turned out
since I left the can.

458
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
Going civilian.

459
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,200
Over here I'm going to put
an oasis with big plants.

460
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,900
Like a waiting area
for the customers.

461
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:26,465
They could buy some
$30 hand cream

462
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,100
while they look at one
of those fountains with the koi in it.

463
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:32,300
- I can get you the koi.
- Really, giant carp?

464
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,265
How the fuck
do you get that?

465
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,600
It's done. Don't give
it another thought.

466
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,600
- Tony, you here?
- Up front.

467
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,100
Hey. I came by
to get the keys.

468
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,100
I would have gone by the laundry
but my dad's such a hard-on at work.

469
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:47,400
Tell me about it.
Amanda, this is my cousin Tony.

470
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,865
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

471
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,700
Hey, do you believe there's
a dog groomer there

472
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
in case somebody
needs a snack?

473
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,065
Place is nice.
A little paint, maybe...

474
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,400
- Amanda, This is my cousin Christopher.
- Hey.

475
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:05,900
So, I met this guy
at a club on Canal.

476
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,265
He says he can hook
us up with ginseng,

477
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,350
fake rhino, nerve tea,
all that herbal shit.

478
00:29:10,385 --> 00:29:12,365
We could keep it up front
with the koi thing.

479
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,900
- If we're still doing that.
- Koi's taken care of.

480
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,700
Well, I got to book.
Nice meeting you guys.

481
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,450
What's she here for,
happy endings?

482
00:29:24,485 --> 00:29:26,365
She's not going
to do massage at all.

483
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,000
She's Kim's daughter.
She's trying to find herself.

484
00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:30,600
She'll do the books
and shit.

485
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,165
Oh. Nice ass.

486
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,800
Those ceiling tiles
come right out

487
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,765
so I can install
the sound system myself.

488
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,700
Think you could put in a word
with number one daughter there?

489
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,800
- For what?
- Get some of that Kung Pao kootchie.

490
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,600
You fucking guys,
this is important to me.

491
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,000
Sex agrees with you.
You look great.

492
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:51,665
You're being
discreet, right?

493
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,700
Well, sneaking around
is actually half the fun.

494
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,165
It's like you
have this secret,

495
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,800
you know, you want
to scream to the world.

496
00:29:59,835 --> 00:30:02,400
Yeah, but do yourself
a favor, though, huh?

497
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:05,200
- Yeah.
- So, how was it?

498
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,300
Uh, I will say that
he took his time.

499
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,500
Oh, you're not
getting off that easy.

500
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:13,300
Come on, details.

501
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
- Hello there.
- Hey, AJ.

502
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,300
Hey, Aunt Ro.

503
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,900
How was school?

504
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:21,900
It sucked.

505
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,800
Mr. Wegler pulled me
out of language lab

506
00:30:24,835 --> 00:30:26,300
to go over my term
paper notes.

507
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,865
I didn't have
my stuff with me

508
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,700
so he puts his faggy
hand on my shoulder

509
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,465
and says "Do your
best. "

510
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
That's his job,
to get you into college.

511
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,265
Or maybe he's
just a big homo.

512
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,165
Could be.
I'm making ziti for dinner.

513
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,700
Go start your assignments.
I will call you.

514
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,965
Could I watch
TV first?

515
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,300
Promise me you're
going to work later.

516
00:30:45,335 --> 00:30:47,600
- But you got to help me.
- I will.

517
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,865
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my Jackie.
- Oh, honey.

518
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,200
They never caught those goddamn
Chinks who killed him.

519
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,800
Oh my God.
It hurts.

520
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,100
So I'm finding the other copy
when Gene the actuary

521
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:18,500
- completely unloads on me.
- Jerk.

522
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Like yelling is going to make me
do anything but screw up more.

523
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,500
You know you have to remember
that when you're the boss.

524
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,100
The boss.
It's amazing, isn't it?

525
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,000
Jerks.
Garbage pails are right there.

526
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,400
Come on.

527
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,550
- Holy fuck!
- What?!

528
00:31:55,585 --> 00:31:57,800
Oh my God,
is it a fetus?

529
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,700
- Oh my God!
- Shh!

530
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,700
- It's crack, or crank maybe.
- They were drug dealers?

531
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,200
Yeah, they were probably thinking
they were being tailed by the cops.

532
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,200
Honey, your parole.

533
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,900
Happy?
Come on.

534
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,300
I have never seen
that much money before.

535
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,065
There's got to be
10-12 grand.

536
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,600
Look at this.
You're doubly blessed.

537
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,500
You're right.
Kim, now this.

538
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,700
I am going
to buy you a ring.

539
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,900
You are the sweetest,
sweetest man.

540
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,750
But you should put
it into the business.

541
00:32:49,785 --> 00:32:52,000
See, I got to start
thinking like that.

542
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:54,100
It's a learning curve.

543
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,800
Well, it seems
to say here

544
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,200
that this Piggy represents
intellectualism over the physical.

545
00:33:04,235 --> 00:33:07,000
So maybe the eyeglasses
are symbolic.

546
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,900
And that's a good topic
for section two in your outline.

547
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,400
AJ!
Wake up!

548
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,700
I'm not going to do
this by myself.

549
00:33:14,735 --> 00:33:16,900
How are you going
to finish this paper?

550
00:33:16,935 --> 00:33:18,700
It's not going
to write itself.

551
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,265
So now this
so-called bag,

552
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,650
you sure it wasn't
on some old lady's arm?

553
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:31,000
I can't believe she
thought it was a baby.

554
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:32,817
People do that shit.

555
00:33:32,852 --> 00:33:34,565
12 grand?
Madonn' mi'.

556
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,900
How many guys you got to jerk off
on a massage table to make that?

557
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:40,300
I don't know.
What do you charge without the table?

558
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Cristal, gentlemen?

559
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,265
Keep it coming,
honey.

560
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,000
From now on, anytime somebody
steps in a pile a shit,

561
00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:50,100
it'll be known
as a Blundetto.

562
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,900
To the Blundetto!

563
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,965
- Oh, wait.
- Oh.

564
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,700
- I'm sorry.
- I wasn't ready.

565
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,000
# Cross over the river,
beyond every cloud #

566
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,700
# She's past the wind #

567
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,865
# Blowing loud #

568
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,100
# Over the mountain #

569
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,100
# A girl waits for me... #

570
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,400
My God, you scared me.

571
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:33,417
What are you
doing here?

572
00:34:33,452 --> 00:34:35,400
Jesus.
Nice greeting.

573
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,400
How are you?
Everything okay?

574
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,265
AJ left this
in his room.

575
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,300
Thought he might
need it to turn in.

576
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,200
Did you even
look at this?

577
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,700
Who the hell
is Anne Dunham?

578
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,700
How the hell
should I know?

579
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,600
Well, she's obviously
some girl who was an expert

580
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,700
on "Lord of the Flies"
three years ago.

581
00:34:58,735 --> 00:35:00,500
This is an A-plus paper.

582
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,865
Since when
do you eat duck?

583
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,765
I can't believe
he would do this.

584
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,100
Neither can I, considering how tight
he is with money.

585
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:13,400
That's not what I meant.
You think he bought this?

586
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
God damn it!

587
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,265
Hello?

588
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,200
Hi, I was just laying here
thinking about you.

589
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,465
What are you wearing?

590
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,400
Yes, hello, Mr. Wegler.
I'm afraid now is not a good time.

591
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:31,565
I'm serious.
I want to know.

592
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,950
Uh, well, yes.
Thank you very much.

593
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:36,300
I will make sure
that he brings it in.

594
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,500
Okay.
Goodbye, Mr. Wegler.

595
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,700
I made reservations
at that crab place down by the shore.

596
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:43,900
Dinner and a little
night swimming.

597
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:45,800
Right, okay.
Thank you.

598
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,300
What did
that fag want?

599
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,600
Jesus Christ, Tony,
everybody's a fag to you.

600
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,800
Maybe you're a fag,
you ever think about that?

601
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,900
Can I help it if I know one
when I see one?

602
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,300
Really? What are the signs...
education, culture?

603
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
Sucking a guy's cock
usually tips me off.

604
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,100
How do you know who sucks whose cock?
You got a little secret?

605
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,800
And what do you care,
anyway, if somebody's gay?

606
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,400
It must be some big fear of yours
or you wouldn't talk about it so much.

607
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:11,800
I forget now. What part of hell
did you say they go to?

608
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,800
Are they with the abortion doctors
or the child molesters?

609
00:36:14,835 --> 00:36:17,667
- That was a long time ago.
- Now you're all open-minded

610
00:36:17,702 --> 00:36:20,500
that you got a couple of friends
that are bologna smokers.

611
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:22,900
- Right?
- What the fuck are you doing?

612
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,300
Going for a swim.

613
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,100
Would you leave
your goddamn socks here?

614
00:36:29,135 --> 00:36:30,765
Your underpants?

615
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,900
# A girl waits for me. #

616
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Hey, that's some
beautiful suit.

617
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,000
I had to get it.
It went with the shoes.

618
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,800
Whose got those?
Vito's guy?

619
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,465
Vasily's,
custom-made.

620
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,400
Only thing I ever found in the street
is my first wife.

621
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,000
Dealer has 20.

622
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,600
Son of a bitch.

623
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,800
- Whoa.
- I just took a beating at craps.

624
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,300
- How you guys doing?
- Pocahontas here is scalping us.

625
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,200
What's the matter?

626
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,600
Just nothing.
I don't know.

627
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,400
I just keep thinking about AJ
and that girl's paper.

628
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,300
Oh, it's a pretty common thing,
Carm, really.

629
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,250
Honestly, you know, the important thing
is you took a stand.

630
00:37:38,285 --> 00:37:41,800
A lot of parents just take it in stride,
or even condone it.

631
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:43,765
It's just the cheating,
you know.

632
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,100
It's just not like him.
He's always done his work.

633
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
Poorly, a lot
of the time, and late

634
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,500
but he always did it,
he never cheated.

635
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,665
Well, wait.
Didn't I read somewhere

636
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,100
in his record that he stole
a test at Verbum Dei?

637
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,300
Please, no, that was just acting out.
He was with a bad crowd.

638
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,600
They were there to vandalize
the science lab,

639
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,800
but it was locked,
so they stole some tests.

640
00:38:02,835 --> 00:38:05,200
Well, I was
a late bloomer too.

641
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,000
Union college
took a chance on me

642
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,400
because they saw that I had potential,
but I wasn't that mature.

643
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:13,600
That's all this is.
AJ's just fighting to keep peace

644
00:38:13,635 --> 00:38:15,700
with the kids who seem
further ahead.

645
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,665
You know, you ask me,
I think he was driven to cheating.

646
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,800
It's that-that Mr. Fiske.
He is ridiculous with the pressure.

647
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,800
I mean, how hopeless
would you feel

648
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,500
if you really worked on something
and still got a "D"?

649
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,100
I have been there, Carm.
You're worrying for nothing, I promise.

650
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,900
I have thought
about this all day.

651
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
You know I almost called you
from the faculty parking lot.

652
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,850
- Oh, Bob.
- What?

653
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:55,900
Stop.
Bob, I...

654
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,865
What's the matter?

655
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,600
I can't right now, I'm sorry.
I'm too upset.

656
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,100
Carmela, stay.

657
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,800
What are you doing?

658
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,865
What kind of mother am I?
I mean, look at us.

659
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,800
Do you realize under the laws
of the Church I am still married?

660
00:39:15,835 --> 00:39:18,400
- The Church?
- I can't do this tonight.

661
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,900
- I'm sorry.
- Jesus, Carmela, come on.

662
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,000
# Thrill me, thrill me #

663
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,700
# Walk me down the lane
where shadows will be #

664
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,600
- # Will be, hiding lovers... #

665
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,500
Okay, thanks.
It was a fucking blast.

666
00:39:57,535 --> 00:39:59,117
You sure you don't
want to eat?

667
00:39:59,152 --> 00:40:00,665
Steak and eggs
up by Skyway's.

668
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,500
- Oh, I can't.
- Come on, shut the door.

669
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,300
I'm going to mange then hit the sack
for the next 14 hours.

670
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:14,100
# They told me be sensible
with your new love. #

671
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,800
Hey, I thought once they move you
upstairs you get to leave early.

672
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:37,300
No such luck.
Got a second?

673
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,065
The Soprano kid.

674
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,000
How is he doing?
Got his paper yet?

675
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,165
Well, the usual.

676
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,700
Solidly below average.

677
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,465
So what, a "C"?

678
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,600
Well no, that's a little
generous for 10% insight,

679
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,365
- 90% Cliff Notes.
- This is an important class, Tom.

680
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,700
Anything less than a "C" is going
to blow that kid out at Arizona State.

681
00:40:59,735 --> 00:41:01,665
You think it's going
to make a difference?

682
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,500
As dean of college admissions
and head of your department,

683
00:41:05,535 --> 00:41:09,000
I happen to know it's a fact.
He's doing his best.

684
00:41:09,035 --> 00:41:11,565
Well, like my dad
used to say,

685
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,000
"The world needs
ditch diggers too. "

686
00:41:14,035 --> 00:41:15,865
Let me ask you something.

687
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,550
How is floating this kid a C-minus
going to fuck things up here?

688
00:41:19,585 --> 00:41:23,200
AJ Soprano's a spoiled lox.
He'd be lucky to go to a trade school.

689
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,165
It's a D-plus.

690
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,800
Tom, cut him a break.

691
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,500
So what does it mean to the kid
who really breaks his ass in here

692
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:44,300
if Fredo Corleone can get a "C"
'cause you asked?

693
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,100
Is that what this is about?
His background?

694
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,800
Good night.

695
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,200
I'll be working
over at the place.

696
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,300
That's good dedication.

697
00:41:58,335 --> 00:42:00,400
Way to go.

698
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,465
See, regular people
need a place to relax too.

699
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,350
They can't just hop on a plane
to the Bahamas, right?

700
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:12,200
Hey, guys, what do you think
of Daddy's business?

701
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Jason, Justin,
I'm talking to you.

702
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,400
- I like it.
- Yeah, it's nice.

703
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,565
Maybe someday when
this thing takes off

704
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,500
you guys can work here,
like as a summer job or something.

705
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,800
Would you like that?
Working with your old man?

706
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,465
Sure.

707
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,565
All right,
put those away.

708
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,000
You got to do your homework
before I take you back

709
00:42:33,035 --> 00:42:35,000
or your mom's going
to kill me.

710
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,100
Mom says we need helmets
to ride the scooters you got us.

711
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:39,865
We'll stop
at Sports Authority.

712
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,865
- Come on, do your homework.
- Where?

713
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,000
I don't know.
Here, on the floor over there.

714
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,200
Hold it like this.

715
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,100
Ready? Ha!

716
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,200
- That was fast.
- I took a shortcut.

717
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,900
You ever think
of painting that ceiling?

718
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,500
Maybe.

719
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,300
How about a glow-in-the-dark
solar system

720
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,165
like I had in college?

721
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
- I was thinking blue, maybe.
- Mm.

722
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,000
You know, like when you stick
your hand in the Caribbean.

723
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,200
Oh, yeah.

724
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,300
Do you think Union College
is a good place for AJ?

725
00:43:56,335 --> 00:43:58,217
I don't know.

726
00:43:58,252 --> 00:44:00,065
It could be.

727
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,965
You know, maybe
you could tell them

728
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,200
how he's a lot like you were
when you were his age.

729
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,100
That's a thought.

730
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,400
So have you ever
been to the Caribbean?

731
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,365
Yeah, Barbados once,
years ago.

732
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,365
- Oh, it was beautiful.
- Yeah, it is.

733
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,200
Maybe you could bring up
the fact that he has ADD,

734
00:44:20,235 --> 00:44:22,800
because it's not
the stigma it once was.

735
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,700
That's true.

736
00:44:24,735 --> 00:44:26,500
It isn't.

737
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,000
Where are you going?

738
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,300
Mmm.

739
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,865
Faculty lunch, right?

740
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,100
Patty D'Amico
brought them.

741
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
What's the matter,
you okay?

742
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,400
Maybe we should
take a time out.

743
00:45:00,435 --> 00:45:02,865
What?

744
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,565
Really, why?

745
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,500
Because every time I think about putting
the arm on Tom Fiske

746
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,200
I want to poke my eyes out
with a knitting needle.

747
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,700
What does that
have to do with us?

748
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:16,500
I just think
we should, uh...

749
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,550
not do this.

750
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:22,492
Oh... no, no.

751
00:45:22,527 --> 00:45:24,400
Here tell me.

752
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,300
I don't know any other way
to put this.

753
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,100
I've been
thinking and...

754
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,765
I don't know, I...

755
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,200
I think you're
a user, Carmela.

756
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:37,000
What?

757
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,500
Maybe you saw
an opportunity in me

758
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,200
and you just took
what you needed.

759
00:45:41,235 --> 00:45:43,400
Oh, that is not true.

760
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,600
I am here because
I enjoy being with you.

761
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,700
It-it was wonderful,
in fact.

762
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,200
Yeah, it was.
I mean, it is, I know.

763
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,400
How could asking someone you're
with for help be using them?

764
00:45:53,435 --> 00:45:55,400
That's what people do.

765
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
Bob, this hurts.

766
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,965
Oh my.
Oh, my stomach. I feel sick.

767
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,300
You strong-armed me using
the only weapon you have... your pussy.

768
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,300
How dare you talk
to me that way?

769
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Okay, let's pretend you don't
know what I'm talking about.

770
00:46:19,435 --> 00:46:22,400
I don't. Of course I don't have
a fucking master's degree.

771
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,900
Leaving me with a massive
hard-on the other night then practically

772
00:46:25,935 --> 00:46:28,600
attacking me sexually
after you got what you wanted.

773
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,800
You know what, Bob?
You are fucked up.

774
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,000
You need help,
you know that?

775
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,100
What a fucking idiot I am!

776
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,665
Take it easy.

777
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,000
Believe it or not,
I thought you cared about me.

778
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,000
- I thought you should know how I feel.
- Fuck you!

779
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,200
You better
watch your step.

780
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,550
Jesus Christ,
it's 4:00 A.M.

781
00:46:56,585 --> 00:46:58,500
Okay, boys,
hands on the table.

782
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,400
Full boat.

783
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,465
Jesus Christ.

784
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,000
- Three fucking jacks over here.
- You just keep jacking, my friend.

785
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:12,300
- That's it for me. Tapioca.
- You blew the whole 12 grand?

786
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,400
What, are you stupid?
I got $400 left.

787
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,100
I punch-in
in two hours.

788
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,200
There's no sense
going home.

789
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,200
Oh, fuck.

790
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,900
Hello?

791
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,200
- Hey, hon, I'm over at your mom's.
- Great.

792
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,500
Roadway Express delivered
five massage tables.

793
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,800
There?
They had that address by mistake.

794
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,565
I told them
to deliver here.

795
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,665
They're still in the boxes.
I looked inside though.

796
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,700
They're pretty spiff.
That Salamanca fabric was worth it.

797
00:48:19,735 --> 00:48:22,265
- It's like leather almost.
- Great.

798
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,300
- What's the matter?
- This shit gives me a headache,

799
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,200
details
and all that stuff.

800
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,700
Oh you. It's no big, for gosh sake.
We'll get Rudy's truck.

801
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,165
- Maybe I have a brain tumor.
- Honey, you don't.

802
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,600
I got this headache in my jaw.
I read it in "Time" magazine.

803
00:48:36,635 --> 00:48:38,600
It's really not
that likely, Jeez.

804
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,700
I got to get back to the painting
or I'll never get out of here tonight.

805
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,400
I am so fucking sick and tired of your
gambling and complaining.

806
00:48:46,435 --> 00:48:48,100
I've got a headache!

807
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,300
When I think of me
waiting outside that prison

808
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,100
for you to come out
I want to vomit.

809
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,200
I am sick!
I'm evil...

810
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,665
Hey, Henry Ford.

811
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,800
Big entrepreneur.
I like color.

812
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,600
My friend Pak come by?
Fix the toilet?

813
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,200
It's not fixed.
He's got to get a fucking part.

814
00:49:19,235 --> 00:49:22,365
Oh, Pak,
he good plumber.

815
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,100
Right over here,
Wes-a Calwell.

816
00:49:25,135 --> 00:49:27,400
"Wes Cahwel, Wes Cahwel. "

817
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,000
West Caldwell.

818
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,900
So, partner,
we open in three day, huh?

819
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,900
You fucking stroll in?

820
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,900
- I'm over here busting my fucking ass!
- You fucking crazy!

821
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,800
I work in your fucking laundry
all fucking day!

822
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,900
You fucking scam artist!

823
00:49:58,935 --> 00:50:00,900
Fuck.

824
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,200
Ah!

825
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,665
The pole is bent.

826
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,300
Somebody been
punching this door?

827
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,200
If you had a man around
you wouldn't need to call me.

828
00:50:47,235 --> 00:50:48,700
Yeah, right.

829
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,000
You're still young, Mel,
a good-looking woman.

830
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,000
There's no reason
you shouldn't move on with your life,

831
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,700
if that's what you want.

832
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,000
Well, there actually
was somebody.

833
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,400
And he seemed
very nice.

834
00:51:13,435 --> 00:51:14,865
Oh, that's good.

835
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:19,700
He was a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

836
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,500
He made all these accusations
about my character.

837
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,865
Whatever I say,
whatever I do,

838
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,165
because I was married
to a man like Tony,

839
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,100
my motives will always
be called into question.

840
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,900
Well.

841
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,250
Hey.
Sit down.

842
00:52:08,285 --> 00:52:10,600
You want something?

843
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,765
What did you do?

844
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,900
My back.
Fucking job.

845
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,100
A work-related injury.

846
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,800
So, here's the thing.

847
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,300
You mentioned you might need someone
to run the swag airbags.

848
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,100
Bring me a vodka rocks

849
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,800
and get me some kind
of a cushion, will you?

850
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,900
What happened with
