1
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,000
...in the bottom of the eighth,
a very tight game.

2
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,700
- A hot day...
- It sure is today.

3
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,600
It certainly is, Roger.

4
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,400
Mets tying it up two to two in the sixth.

5
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:52,965
Man on second...

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,100
Want another super-nacho?

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,800
No, they been sittin' too long.
The cheese is sweaty.

8
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:01,700
This guy in the joint, crazy Rasta fuck,

9
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,000
made grilled cheese on the radiator.

10
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,100
He'd put the bread
between two sheets of paper.

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,465
Had a whole system.

12
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,865
What'd you do to your foot?

13
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,200
The other night in fuckin' Irvington

14
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,700
two black guys jumped me outside a bar.

15
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,800
With half of them locked up grilling cheese,
you'd think there wouldn't be so many around.

16
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,100
- Should I melt another batch?
- Nah. I'm good. I got dinner in the city.

17
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,865
So, Finn,
you got any plans for the summer?

18
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,200
Goin' back to Mission Viejo
to surf or whatever?

19
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:40,465
I'm hopin' to stay here in the city.

20
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,665
- How's summer school going?
- It sucks.

21
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,200
I did summer school once.
You can still have fun.

22
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,200
Casa Carmela?
He's looking at maximum security summer.

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,100
Excuse me a minute.

24
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,965
Why don't you cut your mother a break?

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,500
She's holdin' this family together
during this current situation and all.

26
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,500
- Can we get the check?
- The young man took care of it.

27
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,900
- You paid the check?
- I figured since you're always so generous,

28
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:20,100
I should reciprocate.

29
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,100
Lucky you don't get your head handed to you.
Let's get this straight.

30
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:28,365
- You eat, I pay.
- Mr Soprano...

31
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,900
No, when you have your own family, you pay.

32
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,800
Let's go.

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,500
Just take the money.

34
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,900
- I didn't mean to bite your head off in there.
- I didn't mean to overstep.

35
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:05,400
I just wanted to say thank you.

36
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,900
You're a good guy. I respect you trying.

37
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,100
And then he fell asleep right after.

38
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,800
He did call me late the next morning.

39
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:22,865
And he sent flowers.

40
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,900
But other than that
I haven't heard from him all week.

41
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:28,300
- What'd he say?
- That it was nice, you know.

42
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,400
And it was nice. He was very sweet.

43
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,400
You think what happened at the party

44
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,100
is an overture
Tony wants to get back together?

45
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:37,300
I don't know, maybe.

46
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,100
He's droppin' AJ off later.

47
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,900
This is the last thing I need to get into now.

48
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:46,000
Please, he never had it so good.

49
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,100
- That's him.
- You two should talk. Let me just pee.

50
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,500
So, was your father in a rush now
or something?

51
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:19,300
No, says he was tired.

52
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,600
And to give you this
and a kiss on the cheek.

53
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,900
Thank God.
The last thing I needed was to talk to him.

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,500
Know who loved golf? It was Joey Peeps.

55
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:50,465
May he rest in peace.

56
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,900
- It's sad when they go young like that.
- When they go?

57
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,465
Come on.

58
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,365
It was Little Carmine behind it.

59
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Payback for that whore of his...
Lorraine Calluzzo.

60
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,200
You don't know that for sure, John.

61
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,900
Little Carmine knew
how fond I was of this kid, Tony.

62
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,917
I picked him out of the chorus.

63
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:12,900
Schooled him when he was my driver.

64
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,265
Anything from your cop?

65
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,500
Some homeless fuck saw a guy limpin' away.

66
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:21,500
Then he wasn't sure.

67
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,900
I'll tell ya, I don't know how
I'm gonna get through Joey's funeral.

68
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:47,065
And forget about Ginny.

69
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,500
Every Christmas Joey'd send her

70
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,700
a Grandma's of Maine coffee cake.

71
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:54,417
What's wrong? You all right?

72
00:06:54,452 --> 00:06:56,065
- Is it his heart?
- No.

73
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,600
It's this fucking weather, sudden changes.

74
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,600
Fucks up your respiratory system.
Come on.

75
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,100
- I got you.
- Get some electrolytes in him.

76
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:06,965
We got you. That's it.

77
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,800
Sit down. Good, good. That's it.

78
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,800
You're all right. You're all right.

79
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,800
The point I'm trying to illustrate is that

80
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,965
of course no one wants all-out conflict.

81
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,500
But historically, historical changes
have come out of war.

82
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,865
As far as I'm concerned it's a new day.

83
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Old treaties and ways of doing things
are null and void.

84
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:33,700
- Exactly.
- And the Joe Peeps thing?

85
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,865
Where does that leave us?

86
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,500
When you've had a quadruple bypass
like I did,

87
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:41,165
it gives you a lot of time to think.

88
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,365
The only thing Johnny understands is force.

89
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,100
But the fact is, though,
we pissed on a bees' nest.

90
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,300
What's the other option? Roll over?

91
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,150
We could've had a sit-down.

92
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,365
The other captains, maybe.

93
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,900
This isn't the UN, Angelo. I won't let
what happened to my father happen to me.

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,400
God forgive me, but you may be
a stronger man than your dad was.

95
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,465
The fundamental question is

96
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,000
will I be as effective as a boss
like my dad was?

97
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,165
And I will be.

98
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,365
Even more so, but until I am,

99
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,300
it'll be hard to verify
that I think I'll be more effective.

100
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,665
I just talked to my parents.

101
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,600
They offered me a ticket home.
No economic relief.

102
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,700
What'd the lady at student placement say?

103
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,365
- I never went down there.
- Why didn't you?

104
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,500
This economy, hello? I mean,
even the crappiest McJobs aren't there.

105
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
I wouldn't want to take away a job
a minority could have.

106
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,600
Just... It doesn't cool anything anyway.
Leave it.

107
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,800
Don't open the window, the garbage reeks.

108
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,200
Why do we want to be
in New York anyway?

109
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:51,365
It was supposed to be fun, remember?

110
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,100
Summer before the big push of grad school?

111
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:56,800
You could go out to Jersey, sleep in comfort.

112
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,100
Is that what you want?

113
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,600
No.

114
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,300
All I know is, I cannot go home
and live with my parents.

115
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,800
I graduated.

116
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,200
I mean maybe I should go back out.

117
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:19,000
I can work as a PA for Josh's dad.

118
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,100
At least I'd earn some cash.
You could come out for a week.

119
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,965
Wait, wait, wait. What?

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,400
He's a photographer.
I told you, he does major magazine ads...

121
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,900
BMW, it's pretty cool stuff.

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,200
- Is that what you want?
- No.

123
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,600
- But at least I'd have money.
- Your thing with models.

124
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,100
- There's no models.
- What?

125
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,765
It's interesting work.

126
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,300
As a career, actually, I mean...

127
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,000
Josh's dad saw my shots
that won a prize in school.

128
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:49,300
Said they were "solidly unsentimental".

129
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,600
What are you talking about?

130
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:53,800
Just blow off dental school?

131
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,800
You haven't taken one photograph
in a year.

132
00:09:56,835 --> 00:09:59,100
You bitch every time I ask you

133
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,000
- to take a snap of me and my friends.
- I'm just saying...

134
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,300
I gave up junior year abroad to be with you.

135
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,100
I know, and I wanna stay here.

136
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,000
I could come out West with you.

137
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,800
- But I have to blow off the law centre.
- Is that what you want to do?

138
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:16,317
I don't know.
Do you want me to come out?

139
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:18,800
- If you want to.
- No, you need to say.

140
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,900
Maybe we should stay out there.

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,200
You could transfer to UCLA.

142
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Fuck it.

143
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,765
It's roasting in here.

144
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
It's 10:30. We can go to a movie.

145
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,000
- What do you want to see?
- I don't know, you say.

146
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,300
No, you.

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,365
Hello?

148
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,900
Mrs Soprano. Lee Nieman returning.

149
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,600
Oh, hi, great, thank you.

150
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,700
I gave your secretary the broad strokes.

151
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,000
You're in the middle of a separation,
the attorney retired.

152
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,465
Right, Bob Greenberg.

153
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,200
At any rate, I'm thinking it's time I move forward
with the divorce proceedings.

154
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,965
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you short.

155
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,900
- As far as handling it, I have to recuse myself.
- What do you mean?

156
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,000
Actually, your husband had been in to see me
for a consultation last year.

157
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:23,600
My husband hired you?

158
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,800
No, but based on a prior meeting,
the code of professional responsibility

159
00:11:27,835 --> 00:11:31,300
precludes me from representing you
because of that consultation.

160
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:34,000
He met with Greenberg,
and he wanted to represent me.

161
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,500
Mr Greenberg would've found himself
in a bit of ethical soup had he moved forward.

162
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,265
I don't understand this.
Why is my husband so picky?

163
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,300
He talked to several
top divorce attorneys in New Jersey.

164
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,500
You can probably
figure that manoeuvre out for yourself.

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,965
Jesus Christ.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,500
I understand your frustration.
I can recommend a colleague.

167
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,900
Someone your husband
hasn't contaminated.

168
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,800
Well, yeah, OK.

169
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,200
Accordin' to Johnny Sack,
the kid's brains were splattered over the seat.

170
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:11,165
Joe Peeps?

171
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,700
Couldn't have been too much to clean up.

172
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,800
I heard the hooker
he was with got it in the chest.

173
00:12:17,835 --> 00:12:20,200
Must have been silicone everywhere, too.

174
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:22,200
Why you always try and top me?

175
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,000
You took the air outta my fuckin' punch line.

176
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,800
Anyway, Joey Peeps' mom's a widow,

177
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:31,300
she's in a wheelchair.

178
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Johnny's takin' care of the interment,
that shit there.

179
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:37,400
So I'm thinkin' we should
pick up the headstone.

180
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,000
- Jason, get into it.
- I'll call the marble guy.

181
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,700
- What's up, guys?
- Frank.

182
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,600
- Frankie.
- Talk to you outside?

183
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,600
Gimme two.

184
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,865
What's up?

185
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,700
Turns out somebody got a look
at the guy that did Joe Peeps.

186
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,200
All they got so far is he's got a bad limp.

187
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:18,500
Long John Silver, maybe.

188
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,700
Where the fuck do you get the balls?

189
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,900
I am bendin' over backwards tryin'
to stay neutral, payin' for fuckin' car seats.

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,200
And you're out there
actin' like a fuckin' free agent!

191
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Don't look at me like I'm a jerkoff.

192
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,800
I'm sick of you leanin' on this cousin thing
and that bad hijack,

193
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:40,200
like you can do
whatever the fuck it is you want

194
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,600
cos you went away that night and I didn't!

195
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,500
You keep bringin' that up. I'm fine with it.

196
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,500
First of all, I had nothin' to do with this.

197
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,000
- Don't fuckin' lie to me!
- If I was, would you really wanna know?

198
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,900
That'd just be another problem
for you with Johnny, right?

199
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,700
I know you're not earning what you expected.
And you got the twins, and Nancy.

200
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:18,700
You're a capable guy.

201
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,300
Your mother let it slip one time.
You got an IQ of 158.

202
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:26,700
- She told you that?
- The week you got tested.

203
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:28,700
All the nuns were raving about it.

204
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Lot of good it did me.

205
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,800
I had high hopes when you got out.

206
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,300
Yeah?

207
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,900
Look, a guy like you... brains, balls...

208
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,200
if you'd fucking be straight with me
I could use all that.

209
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:44,400
Put me in, coach.

210
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,300
All right, we got the casino on
Bloomfield Avenue above the hardware store.

211
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:02,000
Carlo's guy was running it,
but he just got diagnosed with Hodgkin's.

212
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,600
- That's mine?
- Yeah.

213
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,665
A lot of fucking money there.

214
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,800
I'll see what I can do
about getting you straightened out,

215
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,000
opening up the books for you.

216
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,300
It's long overdue.

217
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,300
So I solved a major problem business-wise.

218
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Put a very good piece of manpower to work.

219
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,265
My cousin Tony.

220
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,400
You mentioned how close you two are.

221
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,400
When we were kids they called me
Tony Uncle Johnny and him Tony Uncle Al.

222
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:40,900
Right, yes. You told me all that.

223
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,400
Anyway, a very smart guy.
He's got an IQ of 158.

224
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,100
Do you put a lot of stock into that number?

225
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:49,700
Why, are you gonna tell me it's bullshit?

226
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,300
Cos I took that test and somebody gets a 158,

227
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:56,300
well, they know a few things.

228
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,400
So we can assume you think
he's smarter than you.

229
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Honestly, I think he's smarter than you

230
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,065
the way you keep shitting on the test.

231
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,700
But I'm no gabadotz myself.
This was a good move.

232
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,300
Carmela and I slept together.

233
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,700
- What was that like?
- It was nice.

234
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,700
It was very... erotic.

235
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,400
She was wearing that perfume that she wears.

236
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,800
Poor thing was starved for it, honestly.

237
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,500
I'm the only man she's ever been with.

238
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:41,100
Did you discuss it?

239
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,700
Nah, I left before she woke up.

240
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,400
How come?

241
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,000
If she woke up and I was there
it would send mixed signals, you know.

242
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:55,300
I'm not sure that's the best...

243
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,200
Yeah.

244
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,565
No. Tell him I got fax machines
coming out of my ass.

245
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,300
And would you characterise
the separation thus far as amicable?

246
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,665
It's barely civil.

247
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah, there are moments
when old habits kick in. And feelings.

248
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,100
But he is not the person
I want to spend the rest of my life with.

249
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:24,865
Fair enough. As for the assets...

250
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,600
you've given me your tax returns
and investments?

251
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,600
The house is in my name. Not the boat.

252
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,065
- That's the Stugots, is it?
- Yes.

253
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,500
I'm a little concerned that the returns
don't reflect everything.

254
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,900
There is other income, there's a lot more.

255
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,765
- Unreported income?
- Yes.

256
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,600
And this other income,
is it from an illegal stream?

257
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,800
No, of course not.

258
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,900
But he does deal in cash, my husband.
The carting business.

259
00:17:53,935 --> 00:17:56,900
- I see.
- Is that a problem?

260
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,700
I handled a case once
where the husband owned vending machines.

261
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,100
I used a forensic accountant
to reconstruct his finances.

262
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,000
In less than a week,
he outlined 11 years of income.

263
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:15,000
And we're talking coins.

264
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,600
Hey, you. Busy day?

265
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,000
I dropped off an application
at the Cineplex on Broadway.

266
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,800
Stopped by my dad's.

267
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,300
He got you a job working construction.

268
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:33,065
Construction? That's awesome.

269
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,300
It's in Jersey, though.
You'll have to take the PATH train.

270
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:38,465
Fine, no problem.

271
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,265
But the most I ever did, though,
is help my dad paint.

272
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,000
He said you don't need experience.
You'll be a labourer or something.

273
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:50,100
- Pays like 20 bucks an hour.
- Holy shit.

274
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
How is that even possible?

275
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,365
You believe these fucking Blue Jays?

276
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,600
Last inning I screamed so loud
my wife thought I had a heart attack.

277
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:09,165
Why, what happened?

278
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,950
Burrell got shelled. It was beautiful.

279
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,542
- What are you, a Met fan?
- Padres.

280
00:19:14,577 --> 00:19:16,738
- Padres?
- I'm from California.

281
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:18,865
I gotta go make my collections.

282
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,300
Stick with the Angels.
The Pads haven't had a team in 20 years.

283
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:24,900
What do you mean?
They were in the Series in '98.

284
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:27,100
Yanks in four, I was there.

285
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,700
Hey, Shaggy, grab a bucket
and some Lysol. Scrub off my tyres.

286
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,950
There's fuckin' dogshit by the entrance.

287
00:19:38,985 --> 00:19:41,100
I'm supposed to be picking up scrap.

288
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,800
You'll be pickin' up your teeth
in another second.

289
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,300
DeTrolio, you need somethin' to do?

290
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,100
Get fuckin' lost!

291
00:19:48,135 --> 00:19:49,800
Come on, guys.

292
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,300
Go! Before it sets in the treads!

293
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,900
My checks come in yet?

294
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,965
I don't know. I didn't see the girl.

295
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,700
If she ain't got them, send Meadow's friend
when he's done with your car.

296
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:08,267
Who Meadow? What are you talking about?

297
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:10,800
Meadow Soprano. That's her boyfriend.

298
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,600
There he is.

299
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,565
I can't find any Lysol.

300
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,300
Don't worry about it. Why didn't you
tell me you were datin' my niece?

301
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,900
Here.

302
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
You take her someplace nice.

303
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,500
Tell her it's from Uncle Paulie.

304
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,700
Thank you, I... That's really nice.

305
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:36,667
Here. Gimme that shit.

306
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,600
Paulie! Come here.

307
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:41,600
Get the hose.

308
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,400
Sorry I'm late.

309
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,200
- You been waiting long?
- Not really.

310
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,465
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

311
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,565
Well, I don't know
if you're gonna see it that way.

312
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,700
I have asked you to lunch
to tell you I'm filing for divorce.

313
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,600
I hope you brought your appetite.

314
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,400
Why don't you give us a minute?

315
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,200
That's nice.

316
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,000
Invite me to a...

317
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,300
public place so you could ambush me.

318
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,500
- Do you think I won't make a scene?
- Spare me your outrage, Tony.

319
00:21:35,535 --> 00:21:37,800
Accept that I am moving on with my life.

320
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:40,100
Moving on?

321
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,565
That's what you were doing after the party?

322
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,200
You and I both know that didn't change
anything.

323
00:21:45,235 --> 00:21:47,800
We're Italian, we don't believe in divorce.

324
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,500
We believe in the nuclear family.

325
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:52,100
Will you listen to yourself?

326
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,600
And despite your best efforts,

327
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,100
I have an attorney who is going to aggressively
pursue my custody of AJ

328
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:06,200
and also an equitable distribution
of our assets.

329
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:07,765
Our assets?

330
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,600
I am through trying to get you to provide
beyond the minimum I need to live.

331
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,365
So it's fucking money. That's all this is to you?

332
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,800
After all we've been through,
is it so hard to own up to anything

333
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:19,800
beyond that bullshit tax return?

334
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,300
Go stand over there.
I'll call you when I'm ready.

335
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,465
You want money?

336
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,765
My 40 grand you stole out of the bird feeder?

337
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,550
It should be plenty.
You're an investment genius.

338
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:39,300
You want this to get ugly?
These guys live for that.

339
00:22:39,335 --> 00:22:41,200
You think I don't?

340
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,150
The only reason you have anything
is because of my sweat.

341
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:54,200
And you knew every step of the way
exactly how it works.

342
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,500
But you walk around that fucking mansion

343
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,165
in your $500 shoes and your diamond rings

344
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
and you act
like butter wouldn't melt in your mouth.

345
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,200
And you don't want it to get ugly? Too late.

346
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:07,700
I want what I am entitled to.

347
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,000
You're entitled to shit.

348
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,500
She's ready to order.

349
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,265
I guess we get along.

350
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,965
We're just different, you know.

351
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,965
She zigs, I zag. That kind of thing.

352
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,400
- What's her dad like? He's always flirting.
- He's OK. A little intense sometimes.

353
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,100
The main thing's that he's a good person.

354
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,400
- So, you guys gonna get married or what?
- Living together's the same thing.

355
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,665
I lived with a guy once and trust me,

356
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,000
it's not even close to being the same thing.

357
00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:57,265
- What do you mean? Why?
- Cos.

358
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,600
You could just pack up and leave
whenever the shit hits the fan.

359
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,065
Talk to married people.

360
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,565
That ring, believe it or not,

361
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,400
it's got this kind of, like, weird power.

362
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:11,200
So, what happened with you and this guy?

363
00:24:11,235 --> 00:24:14,000
- Phineas, my boy!
- Hey.

364
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,965
It's actually just Finn.

365
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,200
So, the Cubbies gave
your boys a shellacking last night.

366
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:21,565
- It's still early.
- That's true.

367
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,000
You know who he looks like?
That guy from Aerosmith, Joe Perry.

368
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
- Your boss inside?
- Yeah.

369
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,600
All right. I'll see youse around.

370
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
All right.

371
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,300
He seems like a nice guy.

372
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,900
Yeah. They all are, pretty much.

373
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,200
So you dating anybody now?

374
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,100
It's cute.

375
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,365
It's a lot of money for not much shirt.

376
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,965
- Relax, I'll put it on my own card.
- Damn right you will.

377
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Ask your father. He stopped paying my bills.

378
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:07,600
Daddy? You guys looked pretty chummy
in the pool that night.

379
00:25:07,635 --> 00:25:10,700
He went home with Artie.
They helped me clean up.

380
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,800
I have decided to move ahead with the divorce.

381
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,200
- What are you gonna do?
- About what?

382
00:25:24,235 --> 00:25:26,765
- Life, I don't know.
- What can I do?

383
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,700
Haven't you thought
beyond being dependent on a man?

384
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,565
It's so simple for you.

385
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,800
Simple for people who don't expect things
to be handed to them.

386
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,500
Even Finn got a job working construction.

387
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,565
Good for Finn, then.

388
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,365
There are options in life.

389
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,750
Isn't that what you always told me?

390
00:25:43,785 --> 00:25:46,100
You have options. I have a lawyer.

391
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,165
Phineas!

392
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,100
He was just asking. How come a dentist?

393
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:04,667
What's wrong with being a regular doctor?

394
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:07,200
I saw this thing on shark teeth as a kid.

395
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,465
Hey, Phil.

396
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,000
Glad you're not exerting yourself in the heat.

397
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:14,265
Course. Now he comes.

398
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,500
Soon as the Jersey tomatoes are in season,
you can't keep these New York guys away.

399
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,300
Fuck the tomatoes, I'll take the escarole.
You know my brother Billy?

400
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:25,000
- Yeah, what do you say, Bill?
- How you doing?

401
00:26:25,035 --> 00:26:26,865
- Hey, Felicia?
- What?

402
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,300
- Those cases of toner come in yet?
- Yeah, it's in the trailer.

403
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm gonna gas up. I'll be right back.

404
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,900
Toner cartridges now?
They're not skimming enough from this job?

405
00:26:37,935 --> 00:26:40,000
Brother sells them out of his trunk.

406
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,665
- Jesus.
- So, Patsy, the necklace.

407
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,300
- How'd it go with the goomah?
- Beautiful.

408
00:26:45,335 --> 00:26:47,865
With the little emeralds? She fucking loved it.

409
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,900
First he gave her the emeralds,
then he gave her the pearls.

410
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,900
I got Ebel watches, too.

411
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,750
Earrings, whatever you need.

412
00:26:55,785 --> 00:26:57,500
My girl's birthday's coming up.

413
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,900
- Some rack on that girl.
- Yeah, if you can get past the sideburns.

414
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,465
You should talk.
That skank I saw you with?

415
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,300
This girl's fucking moustache...
must've been like kissing a fireman.

416
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,800
Well, you ought to know, sweetie.

417
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,100
- What'd you say?
- Nothing, what? We're just breaking balls.

418
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,565
Finn, what time's that game tonight?

419
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,300
- 8:00, I think.
- I'm gonna take a piss.

420
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,600
Do me a favour. Hold this.

421
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,150
I knew that was coming!

422
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:36,565
- My eye!
- Your eye?

423
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,800
I'm sorry.
I meant to hit you in the fucking mouth!

424
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,600
Gene, Gene, relax.

425
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,900
- You OK?
- All right.

426
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:47,200
Come on.

427
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,400
You made your point.

428
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,400
- Felicia, call an ambulance.
- Use your own phone, I'm busy.

429
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:56,465
You been sick all day. Take the day off.

430
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,800
What about him?
One of these civilians calls the cops?

431
00:27:59,835 --> 00:28:03,100
What? I think I seen
a couple of niggers running that way.

432
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,865
Yeah, those two guys.

433
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,300
Need to rest?
You want some water? You sure?

434
00:28:08,335 --> 00:28:10,800
Eugene Pontecorvo?

435
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,500
He's so sweet.

436
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,900
Sweet? He was like an animal.

437
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,465
Are you gonna eat?

438
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,600
I'm not hungry. It's too hot anyway.

439
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,600
I told you I was making dinner tonight.

440
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,400
It's really good chilli.

441
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,865
You should've seen these guys.

442
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,465
They were laughing. It was fucking sick.

443
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,700
- Is this what you grew up with?
- What are you talking about?

444
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,400
- These people, your dad's friends.
- I never saw one bit of violence growing up.

445
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,465
What about your dad's road rage?

446
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,100
Didn't you tell me you had a boyfriend
who was killed? Shot to death?

447
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,865
First of all, he was killed by drug dealers.

448
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,600
African-Americans,
if that makes you feel better.

449
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,500
You know you talk about these guys
like it's an anthropology class.

450
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:13,800
But they bring certain modes
of conflict resolution

451
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
from all the way back in the old country.

452
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,750
From the poverty of the Mezzogiorno,

453
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:21,500
where all higher authority was corrupt.

454
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,500
For the Lord Jesus Christ
will change our mortal bodies

455
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:29,300
to be like his in glory. For he is risen.

456
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,765
The first-born from the dead.

457
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,900
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection

458
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:38,067
unto eternal life
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

459
00:29:38,102 --> 00:29:41,200
we commend to Almighty God
our brother Joseph,

460
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,700
and we commit his body to its resting place.

461
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,500
"Peeps"? It's a fucking nickname.

462
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,800
Family name is Peparelli.

463
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,465
They're gonna redo it.

464
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,950
Fucking Jason... he's dyslexic.

465
00:29:57,985 --> 00:30:01,400
What's that got to do with it?

466
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,100
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

467
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,700
the Lord bless him and keep him.

468
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,165
The Lord make his face to shine upon him.

469
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,900
The Lord lift up his countenance upon him
and give him peace.

470
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

471
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,700
- Amen.
- Amen.

472
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,400
Amen.

473
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,900
John.

474
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,900
I'm sorry about the stone.
It was a mistake. We'll fix it.

475
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,665
You remember Micky Farrell?

476
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,765
Dock worker, used to run Port Newark?

477
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,600
Guess who he saw on
the Upper West Side the other night.

478
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,200
- Your cousin Tony.
- So what does that mean?

479
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,100
- The night Joey bought it?
- You flip your Maserati, hit your head?

480
00:31:03,135 --> 00:31:06,800
- You two-faced fuck!
- Take it easy.

481
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,500
You want to yell at somebody,
the man you should be talking to is there.

482
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,300
That fucking cocksucker.

483
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,600
I should fucking kill him and his fucking wife

484
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,665
and your cousin next.

485
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,700
Come on, let's take a walk.
Calm down, come on.

486
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,400
The fucking gall on that man!

487
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,600
His father must be spinning.

488
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
You want my advice?

489
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,850
You go out there, you shake his hand

490
00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:52,000
and you put this fucking shit to bed.

491
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,600
Shake his hand?

492
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,600
- And he kisses the kid's mother?
- That's the way it works, you know that.

493
00:31:57,635 --> 00:31:59,665
Sure, that's why your cousin's here!

494
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,300
You are sincerely mistaken
if you think me or my cousin

495
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:05,200
had anything to do with this shit.

496
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,465
- He was spotted three blocks away.
- By Micky Farrell!

497
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,100
You're gonna believe
some drunken Irish fuckin' prick over me?

498
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,165
Have a drink.

499
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,400
- I don't want a fuckin' drink.
- Have one anyway.

500
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,000
So how's your daughter doing?

501
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Good.

502
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,200
All right, maybe I'm wrong,

503
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,500
but you haven't been yourself
since the old man died.

504
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,000
Lorraine Calluzzo.

505
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,400
Then you sink this idiot's boat.

506
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,065
That's not the Johnny Sack I know.

507
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,200
I'm waiting for your explanation, Tony.

508
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,200
My cousin could not have been in the city
that night cos he was with me.

509
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,700
We were looking for his daughter, John.

510
00:33:14,735 --> 00:33:17,600
Cos she fuckin' disappeared.

511
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,000
We were Upstate, Monticello.

512
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,400
We'd heard Kelly had been living
with some fucking crackhead up there.

513
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,300
Matter of fact,
we were gonna reach out to you,

514
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,800
see if you could get some of your people on it.

515
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,200
I swear on my mother, Tony,
if I find out you're lying...

516
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm sitting here humbling myself
out of friendship to you.

517
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,600
There he is...
"Three out of four dentists surveyed. "

518
00:34:34,635 --> 00:34:37,300
- How you doing?
- Where you going? Come here.

519
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,765
OK, settle this...

520
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,400
If they fought today, both in their prime,

521
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Ali or Tyson?

522
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,100
If you were laying a bet.

523
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:55,365
Jeez...

524
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,000
I really don't know.

525
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,200
He don't know. It's an opinion.

526
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,500
Honestly, after the other day,
I don't wanna say the wrong thing.

527
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,365
You see? This kid's all right.

528
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,900
I should get back. Ramos'll be on my ass.

529
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Would you forget about Ramos,
for Christ's sakes? I talked to him.

530
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Have a seat.
We got the good doughnuts today.

531
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,400
I'm exhausted. I hardly slept at all last night.

532
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,900
So take a nap. What are you worried about?

533
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,400
You got any idea the money in that casino?

534
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:00,365
And to give it to Tony B?

535
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,600
Guy's back on the street two minutes,
gets a fucking promotion.

536
00:36:04,635 --> 00:36:06,365
Did you even go to the store?

537
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
They're in the freezer like you like.

538
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,965
- Now he's talking about getting a maid.
- Really?

539
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,100
Guy gets out of jail,
suddenly I'm dogshit in Tony's eye.

540
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:19,700
- Chrissy...
- It's true!

541
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,300
Ever since I cleaned up,
no matter what he says,

542
00:36:22,335 --> 00:36:24,400
Tony don't believe a person can change.

543
00:36:24,435 --> 00:36:26,065
This asshole went to a shrink.

544
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Maybe he thinks you're working too hard.
North Carolina plus other stuff.

545
00:36:30,135 --> 00:36:34,200
I can multitask, Adriana.
I'm not a fucking retard.

546
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,200
It's always some shit with him.

547
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,250
Side deals, secret promises.

548
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:40,165
He's always got an agenda.

549
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,800
What happened to not sweating
the small stuff?

550
00:36:42,835 --> 00:36:45,400
All I know is I used to be number one cousin.

551
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:47,400
Now I'm being eased aside.

552
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,500
Your whole attitude in general.

553
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,300
And while we're at it, remember what we said

554
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,400
about interrupting while I'm on the telephone.

555
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:03,000
OK, Mom.

556
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,300
- Hello?
- It's me.

557
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,200
Hi, what's up?

558
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,600
Dale just told us he figured out
the rest of his life.

559
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:21,000
- You still thinking CIA?
- Yeah, fight terror.

560
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,400
Nah, I'm gonna go to film school.

561
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,400
Me too.

562
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,100
- I got to motor.
- You don't have to work for like three hours.

563
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,300
He has to sleep a little.

564
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,800
I'll get a ride with Alex.

565
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,000
At this point it doesn't pay to go home.

566
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,400
Maybe I'll just crash at work.

567
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,100
Felicia told me
where there's a key to the trailer.

568
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,300
Felicia told him.

569
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,300
- Be careful driving.
- All right. I'll see you tonight.

570
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,500
- Later.
- Bye.

571
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,500
You sound like a racehorse pissing in there.

572
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
How's it going?

573
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,100
- I never asked you what your last name is.
- It's DeTrolio.

574
00:39:27,135 --> 00:39:30,900
Finn DeTrolio, my arch-nemesis.

575
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,500
- You enjoying yourself here?
- It's all right.

576
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,200
I keep telling you you shouldn't work so hard.

577
00:39:39,235 --> 00:39:42,200
Long hours. This fucking heat.

578
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,400
Plus you came in so early today.

579
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,400
I just do what the job is.

580
00:39:48,435 --> 00:39:50,265
Good.

581
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,100
You're strong. That helps.

582
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,000
You know you can call me Vito?

583
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,000
Yeah, I know.

584
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,600
So say it.

585
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,200
Let me hear you say, "What's up, Vito?"

586
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,850
- What's up, Vito?
- Not much, Finn.

587
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:14,500
Except I got a little surprise for you.

588
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,300
Two tickets to see your Padres
take a beating from the Yanks tonight.

589
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,900
- Shit.
- Third baseline. Plus, it's bat night.

590
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,800
That's really nice, Vito, but I...

591
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,700
- I'm... don't know if I can...
- Don't pull that "aw shucks" shit with me.

592
00:40:31,735 --> 00:40:33,700
You're fuckin' going.

593
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,700
I'll see you under the bat tonight. Seven sharp.

594
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,600
And I don't like to miss the national anthem.

595
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,365
So you're just not gonna show up?

596
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,800
You love baseball. What is wrong with you?

597
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:10,300
I don't like the guy, all right?

598
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,265
Right. I get it.

599
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,500
Dr DeTrolio can't hang with the common folk.

600
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,665
He came on to me, all right?

601
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,900
- Either that or he wants to kill me.
- What?

602
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,800
I saw him blowing some security guard
in the parking lot.

603
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,200
- When? What are you talking about?
- This morning I showed up early.

604
00:41:32,235 --> 00:41:36,500
I didn't wanna say anything but...
I'm really afraid of this guy.

605
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,900
Vito Spatafore is a married man, Finn.

606
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,350
I seriously doubt he wants to kill you.

607
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:45,700
Maybe he wants to fuck me and then kill me.

608
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,300
Wait. Is that why you got out the suitcase?

609
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,065
I am not going back to the site.

610
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,900
Do you have any idea
the strings my father pulled

611
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,300
to get you that job? And you just fucking quit?

612
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,300
I'm gonna hear so much bullshit!

613
00:42:02,335 --> 00:42:04,200
So it's all about you, right?

614
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,000
Is that all you can say
whenever it's anything to do with my feelings?

615
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,300
- You're going back to Mission Viejo?
- I didn't say that.

616
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,200
Why don't you just admit it?

617
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,100
This whole thing... the fight, the stuff with Vito,

618
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,217
it's about you not wanting to commit.

619
00:42:20,252 --> 00:42:22,265
I'm here! We fucking live together!

620
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,600
- But you got out a suitcase!
- It's my process, OK?

621
00:42:25,635 --> 00:42:27,400
Look, you never can tell.

622
00:42:27,435 --> 00:42:28,865
Your process?

623
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,300
About anything, the future.
I was thinking out loud.

624
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,600
Well, not out loud, but in the action
of getting out the suitcase I was thinking.

625
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,100
Thinking of leaving!

626
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:41,565
No. Well, yes.

627
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,900
But, I'm still here. I didn't go.

628
00:42:43,935 --> 00:42:45,500
Fuck you!

629
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,300
Right, great. Fuck me.

630
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,300
There was no abundant intentionality
in me getting out the suitcase.

631
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,500
I can leave too, you know.
My friend Hunter's in Montreal.

632
00:42:54,535 --> 00:42:56,867
Do I know? With the French roommate guy

633
00:42:56,902 --> 00:42:59,165
who was all over your ass when we visited.

634
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,000
You don't think you keep mentioning him
every 24 hours at a minimum?

635
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,000
Because he's thinking
of becoming an oral surgeon.

636
00:43:09,035 --> 00:43:10,965
And you might have had a new friend

637
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,700
if you hadn't been
so obnoxious to him at the club!

638
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,950
Can we just stop fighting?

639
00:43:17,985 --> 00:43:19,892
You got out a suitcase!

640
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:21,800
I'll put it back, OK?

641
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,000
Now batting for the Padres...

642
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,800
So it's not about us,

643
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,300
but suddenly you're talking about options.

644
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,565
Don't paraphrase what I said.

645
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,900
I said this point in our lives
is a transition period

646
00:44:00,935 --> 00:44:04,100
forced on us by external events.

647
00:44:04,135 --> 00:44:06,167
School is over for me.

648
00:44:06,202 --> 00:44:08,200
And next year for you.

649
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:13,100
These are difficult choices. You'd rather not
have choices? Thank God for choices.

650
00:44:13,135 --> 00:44:16,665
Stop your bullshit! It's really simple.

651
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,500
- Are we going to stay together or not?
- If you want.

652
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,000
- That's not what I asked!
- I said I did.

653
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:24,365
You said,
how are we going to keep it together

654
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,000
through four years of dental school for you
and med school for me?

655
00:44:28,035 --> 00:44:30,000
Well, it's a good question.

656
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,200
But why ask it now? Tonight of all times?

657
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,165
- Are you asleep?
- No.

658
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,300
You were! And now you were gonna lie
like you did about the suitcase.

659
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,100
I did not lie about the suitcase.

660
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:52,267
Then what do you call it?

661
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:54,400
I don't know, I explained it.

662
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,200
You should quit the law centre.

663
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,100
You're like a prosecutor at four am.
I can't think.

664
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,300
How can you sleep in the middle of this?

665
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,165
In the middle of what?

666
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,465
I said I didn't wanna go back to the job site

667
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,800
and maybe I should go home
until this thing with Vito blows over.

668
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,765
But you didn't ask me to come!

669
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,400
You went to the closet
and got out your suitcase!

670
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,900
Jesus Christ!

671
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,900
Look, just stop crying, OK?

672
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,200
Why don't we just get married?

673
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:36,165
Married?

674
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,800
Let's get engaged.

675
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,465
Really?

676
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,500
Why are you saying that now?

677
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,100
I can't think, it's too late.
It's just something I feel very strongly.

678
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,200
I was wondering when I'd hear from you.
I never got your statement.

679
00:46:55,235 --> 00:46:58,000
Well, actually that's why I called.

680
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,000
- We hit a bit of a snag.
- What kind of snag?

681
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:05,300
Well, I put a call in to Phil Canter
a few days ago, the forensic accountant.

682
00:47:05,335 --> 00:47:08,400
- The one with the vending machines.
- I didn't hear from him.

683
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,200
Suddenly he called
and said he wasn't interested.

684
00:47:11,235 --> 00:47:13,000
So I called another accountant.

685
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,600
And?

686
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:19,300
Frankly, when he heard your husband
was the defendant, he demurred as well.

687
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,800
What does this mean?
You don't want the case?

688
00:47:21,835 --> 00:47:23,900
Well, as my partners reminded me,

689
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I do have a full caseload already.

690
00:47:26,035 --> 00:47:28,000
I probably should have mentioned...

691
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,800
And you were feeling so positive.

692
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,500
I woke up this morning,
the depression just washed over me.

693
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,367
You are dissolving a 20-year marriage.

694
00:47:54,402 --> 00:47:57,200
It's not my fuckin' goddamn marriage, OK?

695
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,800
I had another panic attack.

696
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,000
And I thought I had this shit beat!

697
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,365
What happened?

698
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,200
Playing golf with a friend of mine and he was...

699
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,100
talking about this young guy he knew
who passed away.

700
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,250
I guess I became overcome with emotion

701
00:48:20,285 --> 00:48:22,900
cos they had to help me off the tee.

702
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,000
It's not the first time it's happened recently.

703
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:33,565
I wish you had told me.

704
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,800
Yeah, well, I wish you'd cured it.

705
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,900
When the attacks first reappeared,

706
00:48:41,935 --> 00:48:44,165
what was going on in your life?

707
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,900
You had just rebuffed my affections.

708
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,100
When you passed out
were you thinking about me, or...

709
00:48:53,135 --> 00:48:56,667
I walked into my house and the cleaning girl

710
00:48:56,702 --> 00:49:00,165
was crying on the phone about her cousin

711
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,800
who went off the road
in a Mexican bus wreck or something.

712
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,465
And I remember just feeling inside

713
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,000
like I wanted to choke her
cos it was always something with her.

714
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,450
Next thing I know, boom!

715
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,600
When did it next happen?

716
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,765
My cousin Tony was up at the house.

717
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,800
He wanted to borrow some tools
and they weren't there.

718
00:49:27,835 --> 00:49:29,565
I was inside talking to Carmela

719
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:36,200
and started to feel that... you know.
And it passed.

720
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,400
Your cousin was at your house?

721
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:40,700
Yeah.

722
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,000
Tony Uncle whatever.

723
00:49:43,035 --> 00:49:44,365
Uncle Al.

724
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,500
And your maid was crying about her cousin.

725
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,900
And the other day at the golf course...

726
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,500
my cousin entered into that, too.

727
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,565
- In what way?
- He hurt his foot.

728
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,100
You were so concerned
about your cousin's foot

729
00:50:02,135 --> 00:50:04,500
you collapsed on the golf course?

730
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:07,000
I worry about him.

731
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,600
He's a grown man, isn't he?

732
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,965
Is he in danger of losing the foot, or...

733
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,600
Fuck his foot! It's not his foot! Forget the foot!

734
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,200
I worry about him. He's...

735
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,400
right out of fucking jail, OK?

736
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,500
All right, look.

737
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,900
The reason he went to prison

738
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,700
is he got pinched
hijacking a truckload of Betamaxes in '86.

739
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:46,100
They hooked him up on a RICO
and he got 17 years.

740
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,100
I was supposed to be there
the night of the jacking.

741
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,600
- I see.
- You see.

742
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,265
Why didn't you go?

743
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,465
I was jumped by a bunch of moolinyans.

744
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,300
They were trying to take my shoes. I fought
them off, but they cut my fuckin' head open,

745
00:51:09,335 --> 00:51:11,900
the jigaboo cocksucking motherfuckers.

746
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:14,065
OK, forget that.

747
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,065
Your cousin went to prison.

748
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,700
That's tremendous guilt to carry.

749
00:51:18,735 --> 00:51:20,900
He went to Nam, I was 4F.

750
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,100
And that's the way our friends look at it.

751
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,200
And that's why you favour Tony Uncle Al...

752
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,850
And those 17 years, I did so good.

753
00:51:30,885 --> 00:51:34,400
He lost his wife, his daughter.

754
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,100
No wonder you're having anxiety attacks.

755
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah.

756
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,400
Maybe if you came clean with him?

757
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,100
Yeah, well... yeah.

758
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,600
- You OK?
- Yeah.

759
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,000
Go on... go on...
go on with what you were saying.

760
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:02,100
- Are you having an attack now?
- No.

761
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,000
I had a huge lunch, that's all. It's gas.

762
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,300
What is it, Anthony?

763
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,400
The night he got pinched
I had a fuckin' panic attack.

764
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,600
From my mother, goddamn it!

765
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,600
- I didn't even know what it was then!
- Just relax.

766
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,565
Focus on your breathing.

767
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,650
- Slowly.
- It's not that, I just...

768
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:26,700
I just need some Beano or something.

769
00:52:26,735 --> 00:52:29,300
No, just please, focus.

770
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,600
I've got my medical bag in case.

771
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:40,300
Black guys, my ass.

772
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,900
I had a fight with my mother
and I had a fuckin' panic attack!

773
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
OK, forget that for now.

774
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,600
Carmela was supposed to come over
with some fuckin' yarn

775
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,000
for some bootees
my mother was making Meadow.

776
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,265
She was late.

777
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,100
What the fuck. Why go into it?

778
00:53:04,135 --> 00:53:06,265
Close your eyes.

779
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,400
Focus on your breathing.

780
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,200
- You want some water?
- She was carrying on.

781
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,765
I said to her... I said, "Carmela loves you.

782
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,900
"You gotta understand it,
she's got a three-month-old. "

783
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,300
But she kept fucking... she kept going

784
00:53:35,335 --> 00:53:37,217
and I started screaming at her.

785
00:53:37,252 --> 00:53:39,065
So I left. I walked out the door.

786
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,500
I went over to the car,
I opened the door, boom!

787
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,165
Cut my fucking head open.

788
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,800
- And your cousin doesn't know this?
- No, I lied! What am I gonna tell him?

789
00:53:47,835 --> 00:53:49,700
What am I gonna tell all of them?

790
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,100
I had a fight with my mother and I fainted?

791
00:53:54,135 --> 00:53:55,700
That's why I missed the job.

792
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,900
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

793
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,100
That's a lot to get off your chest.

794
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,200
I thought I was smart and that's why I bumped
him up and protect him.

795
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:23,600
Turns out I'm just a fuckin' robot
to my own pussy-ass weakness.

796
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,400
He's also a capable person.

797
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,900
You OK?

798
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,600
Sometimes what happens in here
is like taking a shit.

799
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,700
Yes, OK.

800
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:45,200
Although I prefer to think of it
more like childbirth.

801
00:54:45,235 --> 00:54:49,500
Trust me. It's like taking a shit.

802
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,700
- Hello?
- Mom? I'm engaged.

803
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,665
- What?
- Finn proposed.

804
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,165
- We're getting married.
- Are you sure?

805
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,300
That's wonderful, honey.
I'm just so surprised!

806
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,400
I... He's gonna finish
dental school, though, right?

807
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,200
We're both finishing school.
We won't marry till we have our degrees.

808
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,965
This is so exciting.

809
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,100
I can't wait for you to meet his parents.

810
00:56:16,135 --> 00:56:17,665
We'll have to have a party.

811
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,700
He's using his graduation present
to buy me a ring.

812
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,900
That is so sweet.

813
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,800
I told him he shouldn't.

814
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,200
- God, I'm gonna cry.
- Yeah.

815
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,800
English
