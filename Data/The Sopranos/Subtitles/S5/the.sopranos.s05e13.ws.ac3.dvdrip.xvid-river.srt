1
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,500
You were right. Forensics has signed off
on him. The body can be released.

2
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:53,200
Why don't you wait
till they fix him up over there?

3
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,800
I promised our mother
I'd see him like we knew him, Jimmy,

4
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,700
before they put on all that pancake and shit.

5
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,800
Your funeral director's car is here.
I'll go down and meet them.

6
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,100
John, how long I gotta wait?

7
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,500
Tony Soprano left to his own device

8
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,600
is never gonna give up
that fuckin' animal Blundetto.

9
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,900
- Philly...
- An eye for an eye?

10
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,200
This is kinda fun.

11
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,100
But, if I was you, I'd dump this job.

12
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,300
I'd go to Italy.

13
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,200
This is no way for a caretaker to live.

14
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,365
Well, a few things have to settle down first.

15
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,100
My cousin'll send the funds
to go through Canada.

16
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:20,600
Italy. Wow. Nice cousin.

17
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,100
Oh, hey, thanks for that massage.

18
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,000
My toe doesn't hurt hardly at all now.

19
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,700
Watch the windows.

20
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,665
Excuse me.

21
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,365
How ya doing? You're Joanne, right?

22
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,200
- Who are you?
- Well, we're friends of your son's.

23
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,800
My son doesn't live with me.

24
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,100
We're... from Alcoholics Anonymous.

25
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:01,700
What's your name?

26
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Well, we're anonymous.

27
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:05,800
I see his car's out front.

28
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,300
He went to California or Vegas, I don't know.

29
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,465
California or Vegas. When did he leave?

30
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,600
- I'm sorry, I have to go to work.
- Where the fuck is he?

31
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,400
- Leave me alone.
- I had a brother your son's age.

32
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:20,565
Please let go of my hand.

33
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,765
Where the fuck is he, you fuckin' cunt?

34
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,200
I'll take that Discman and I'll ram it up your box.

35
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:28,200
Philly, please!

36
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,700
It's the guy's mother, Phil.

37
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:33,200
It's the guy's mother.

38
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,965
Those jocks are juicers.

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,800
- They'll do it for the free brew.
- You're still here?

40
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm driving to school,
I don't have to leave as early.

41
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,465
He'll bring some cool people.

42
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,065
- What are you doing up?
- Snowblower.

43
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,500
Seems to me you are not
sleeping that well, period.

44
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,200
Look at you.

45
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,400
I told AJ to fix this leak while
I was still at my mother's.

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,500
What's going on with him?

47
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Every time I go by the room he's on the bed
on the phone.

48
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:10,400
I am so sick of nagging him.

49
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,600
And if he thinks he's gonna get into East
Stroudsburg State, he is sadly mistaken.

50
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,700
Look at this kid out there, the gardener's son.

51
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,400
- Can't ask this one to take out the trash.
- Poverty is a great motivator.

52
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,400
- You think we gave AJ too much?
- Then you look at Meadow.

53
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:38,900
Same house, everything. She's doing great.

54
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:40,465
She takes after you maybe.

55
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Don't do that. He's my son too.

56
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,200
I got that appointment with his coach today.
Maybe he's got a clue.

57
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:52,000
- Hello?
- In here, Dad.

58
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,365
Hey, there's my little amaretto cookie.

59
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,100
Clear a place so we can take a look at these.

60
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:02,000
Only preliminary drawings.

61
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,165
I've got scones if anybody wants.

62
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,000
Take a look at the house
your mother's gonna build!

63
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,765
And Grandpa, of course.

64
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,100
Tony, Ignatz is responsible for those Normandy
chateaux up on Tisch Drive.

65
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,100
Wow, look at that entry. What is that,
like three storeys high?

66
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,400
- T?
- Christopher, hi, it's Carmela.

67
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,365
- Is Adriana there?
- No.

68
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,900
I was just wondering what was going on.
I stopped by Fortunoff's.

69
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:51,500
She was supposed to get back to them about
her china pattern

70
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,900
and she hasn't returned their calls.
Is everything all right?

71
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,650
- We broke up.
- What?

72
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,100
Why? What happened?

73
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,765
Nothing. She left. Broke my heart.

74
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,400
Moved out a couple of days ago,
I haven't seen her.

75
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,265
Oh, no, that's terrible. Are you all right?

76
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,800
She stiffed me on the club,
never showed up for work.

77
00:07:13,835 --> 00:07:16,300
Oh, my God! Is there anything I can do?

78
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,365
Well, look, I gotta go.

79
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,700
- Somebody's waiting.
- I am devastated.

80
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:25,000
I want to reach her. Is there a number?

81
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:27,265
Not that I know of.

82
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,100
Chris, listen, there's other fish in the sea.

83
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
I know. Thanks.

84
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,900
Tony Soprano and Vito Spatafore
talking about the bus station project.

85
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:04,800
Adriana La Cerva. The way we make it

86
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,400
she's either taken off or maybe gotten clipped.

87
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:10,200
- You hear anything?
- Clipped, why?

88
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,100
- Stepping out on her boyfriend.
- I heard she took off.

89
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:18,500
- Any idea where?
- How should I know? He's a dope addict!

90
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:20,700
Did I already give you that?

91
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,000
- If you hear anything let me know.
- Say hello to Ike and the guys.

92
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
T's held up. He said to start without him.

93
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,500
- All right?
- Yeah.

94
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
What can we say about this guy?

95
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,300
The ancient Romans had a word for it...

96
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:44,800
Asshole.

97
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,600
In all candour though, we love you, Raymond.

98
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Take that away. He ain't coming.

99
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,150
- Who, Chris?
- South with the geese.

100
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:04,642
Christopher is the logical sacrifice bunt.

101
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,088
- The dead brother.
- I'm his brother-in-law.

102
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:09,500
Think New York is really gonna
come after you?

103
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,765
The fuck do I know?

104
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,900
If you're them, you want somebody
close to Tony as possible.

105
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,465
And who knows him better and longer?

106
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,650
Johnny's gonna
put a financial squeeze on all of us.

107
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm already getting
fucked with by Johnny's people.

108
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,500
- It's not good.
- All due respect,

109
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm willing to die for a good cause.

110
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,600
- But this is bullshit.
- There he is!

111
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,500
Sit down.

112
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,965
What's going on?

113
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,600
Vito misto, how are ya?

114
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,400
- Happy birthday, Ray.
- Thanks for coming, Tone.

115
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:49,600
I brought these plus... that's a good one.

116
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,965
I serve it at my house. It's from Avellino.

117
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
My grandfather said that some
of my ancestors were winemakers.

118
00:09:58,035 --> 00:10:00,500
- What the fuck do I know?
- Thanks, Tone.

119
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:02,500
That's gonna be a treasure.

120
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,600
Yeah, well, whatever.

121
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,900
Larry!
What the fuck are you doing here?

122
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,550
- You're under house arrest.
- Fuck them.

123
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:14,065
I ever see that prison doctor, I'm gonna say,

124
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,900
"Did they ever show you these in medical
school? They're called balls. "

125
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,300
Good for you!

126
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,400
Listen, I can't stay.

127
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,450
I got a meeting I gotta go to.

128
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:29,900
I got something I wanna say.

129
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,400
My cousin Anthony
went into business for himself.

130
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,200
We all know this.

131
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,800
In a way for which there is no excuse.

132
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,200
He's got a problem with rage.

133
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,100
He disappointed me, Anthony, in ways
that I can't even begin to tell you.

134
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,900
And he put us all at risk.

135
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:53,900
Irregardless,

136
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
it's been made clear to me
that if they put their hands on him,

137
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,100
he will not be dealt with quick.

138
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,200
We're talking torture.

139
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,000
For that reason, even if
I knew where my cousin was and I do not,

140
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,900
I would not deliver him up to them.

141
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,365
I am offering him the same protection

142
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,700
that I would offer any of you
in similar circumstances.

143
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,300
I know what you're gonna say.
"Hey, I would never do what he did. "

144
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,200
God bless, I hope not. But we are a family.

145
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,100
And even in this fucked-up day
and age that means something.

146
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,200
So we are gonna deal
with this as a family, together.

147
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,100
No matter how it affects anybody

148
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,100
personal safety-wise,
financially-wise, whatever.

149
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,500
I see that my nephew isn't here
and it's important he lam it now.

150
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,100
It's my desire that you circle
the wagons, you support him.

151
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,000
Until and as such...

152
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,900
Raymond. I'm sorry I can't stay.

153
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,900
Happy birthday, huh?

154
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,900
- Thanks.
- Gentlemen, enjoy your dinner.

155
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,500
See ya, T.

156
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,300
Thank you. That was great.

157
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,500
- Thought you had Raymond's birthday dinner.
- I left early.

158
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
It's nice you're home.

159
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,000
There's chicken parm.

160
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,700
Was Christopher there?

161
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,465
No.

162
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,000
Did you know that him and Adriana broke up?

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,800
This kid, that's his trouble.

164
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,165
He keeps it all bottled up.

165
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,300
Then they wonder why they
get chemical dependencies.

166
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,800
Do you think there was somebody else?

167
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,200
There was this one night, it was way back,
movie night with the girls.

168
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:22,517
Adriana was upset and wanted to get
something off her chest.

169
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,800
Then she ran out crying.
I'll bet she was seeing somebody.

170
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,200
You never know about people.

171
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,865
His plans were often startling,

172
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,000
instinctive, spontaneous,
and not infrequently, obscure.

173
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,800
His men idolised him
and had boundless faith in him.

174
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,200
After being promoted in 1916,
he joyfully returned home on leave

175
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:51,900
to marry his sweetheart, Lucie Maria Mollin.

176
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,250
She would be the love of his life to its end.

177
00:13:57,285 --> 00:14:00,600
Rommel saw the huge assault on France
forming,

178
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:03,617
and he saw that a new armoured weapon...

179
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:06,600
I still love this old house so much.

180
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,800
I should do half so good with my stupid project.

181
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,200
...almost precisely what he had done
as a lieutenant during WWI.

182
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm sorry, did you wanna be alone?

183
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,665
No.

184
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,000
...blitzkrieg in its truest form.

185
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,400
It was Rommel...

186
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,600
He had what the Germans call
Fingerspitzengefühl,

187
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,000
which is a sixth sense of sizing up a
situation.

188
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,750
- Claude Rains.
- Thanks for doing this.

189
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:29,800
About 1500 there. Should tide you over.

190
00:15:29,835 --> 00:15:31,700
- Hey, Sil.
- Hey, kid.

191
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
You want something? Fries?

192
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,100
- It's fuckin' something, this situation.
- Right.

193
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,000
I can't even get down
to Milt's, fence some jewellery.

194
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:43,800
Everybody with eyes in the back of their head.

195
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,200
- I was Tony's driver.
- It's amazing.

196
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:48,065
You want me to be honest?

197
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,600
The favouritism Tony still shows for our fuckin'
cousin, after what he's done?

198
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:54,900
What does Tony B have on this guy?

199
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,400
I might take a bullet for this skeeve.

200
00:15:57,435 --> 00:15:59,800
After all your uncle's done for you?

201
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,700
I need to get into specifics?

202
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,300
You said you went home.

203
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,800
Just heard her old man died. I'll give her a call.

204
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,400
Actually, I've been hanging around on purpose.

205
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:41,300
I gotta talk to you, Tone.

206
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,200
About what?

207
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,100
- I've been your consigliere for years.
- Don't go into a fuckin' preamble.

208
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:54,200
- Tell me what's on your mind.
- You got some unhappy people out there.

209
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:57,265
- No shit.
- Not just the young guys.

210
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,865
Guys that've been
with you since the beginning.

211
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,900
Before the beginning.
Guys who worked for your father.

212
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,600
- Fuckin' Paulie, right?
- I'm not saying nothing.

213
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,200
Goddamn him.

214
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,800
These guys, would do whatever you ordered.

215
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,900
- Except in this case.
- Don't say it like that.

216
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,465
Forget that Tony Blundetto's my cousin.

217
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,200
I give him up, we can give
the whole fuckin' thing up.

218
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,700
Here's where the conversation gets difficult.

219
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,000
- Go.
- All due respect.

220
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,100
You were ready to hand him your cousin
a week ago.

221
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,100
It's not about standing with the guys
or upholding some rules. Not really.

222
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,700
Then what's it all about?

223
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,365
Why don't you illuminate me?

224
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,200
It's about you don't wanna eat shit from John.

225
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:44,800
You don't wanna bow down.

226
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,100
You told him to go fuck himself.

227
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,965
Which, to be honest,

228
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,600
wasn't exactly appropriate, considering.

229
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,865
- Oh, is that right?
- All due respect.

230
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,700
What the fuck do you know
what goes on in my head?

231
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,765
I've known you since you were a kid.

232
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,000
Frankly, you got a problem with authority.

233
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,665
This attitude of yours,

234
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,600
it's a lot of what's made you an effective leader.

235
00:18:11,635 --> 00:18:15,465
But we all got flaws. Even you.

236
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,800
Seven deadly sins and yours is pride.

237
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,700
All due respect. You got no fuckin' idea
what it's like to be number one.

238
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,600
Every decision you make affects every facet of
every other fuckin' thing.

239
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:37,965
It's too much to deal with almost.

240
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,200
And in the end,
you're completely alone with it all.

241
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
I'm sorry you feel that way.

242
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,365
This is the course I've chosen,

243
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,300
and those of you that are not with me on it,
well, that makes me sad.

244
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,200
And it'll be dealt with in time.

245
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,900
You need me for anything else?

246
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,800
- Benny, right?
- How ya doing, Mr Leotardo?

247
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,300
I'm sitting listening to WFAN and I go,
isn't that the kid that used to drive for Tony?

248
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,600
- I'm on my way to the hospital.
- Well, that's up to you.

249
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,600
No, I mean my mom, she...

250
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,800
- Where's his friend?
- What friend?

251
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:25,500
Don't fuck with me, kid!

252
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:27,100
Don't fuck with me!

253
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,500
- Where's Blundetto?
- I don't know!

254
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,900
It's a start.

255
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,000
- Jesus.
- He has a fractured skull.

256
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,600
- Is he talking at all?
- A little.

257
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,900
Listen, Ben, I want you to know that...

258
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,500
...it'll be taken care of through
the plumber's union health plan.

259
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,100
You know what? We were talking here.

260
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,665
It's time for you to get your own customers.

261
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,700
You're getting a little too old
to be beating people up.

262
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,300
- Where's Larry?
- He's staying home.

263
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,465
He's the boy's godfather. He called me.

264
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,100
- Said he was gonna be with the kid.
- House arrest.

265
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
All right.

266
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,265
- This is fucked up.
- What do ya wanna do about it?

267
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,800
What do I wanna do? I want that man there
to do something about it.

268
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,200
I want him to give us the OK
to go to Brooklyn,

269
00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:31,365
clean some timepieces over there.

270
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,865
Tony Blundetto whacked
the brother of a captain.

271
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,400
If Tony tried to strike at them again,
we should take him out.

272
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,700
Look, just give me that first one,
the Oregonian.

273
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:50,500
$39.95.

274
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,100
You're sending a fruit basket to the kid.

275
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,400
- He'll appreciate it.
- It's for Mel.

276
00:22:57,435 --> 00:22:59,365
The poor guy had a stroke.

277
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,800
- He's younger than me.
- Melvoin?

278
00:23:02,835 --> 00:23:04,600
Jesus Christ, that's terrible.

279
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,200
That's why I asked you to come over.
His speech...

280
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:11,700
He'll sound a little suonato,
probably forever.

281
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:15,500
But get this, nine months, maybe a year,

282
00:23:15,535 --> 00:23:18,267
till he can work a full schedule.

283
00:23:18,302 --> 00:23:21,000
They'll have to postpone my retrial.

284
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,165
No shit?

285
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,100
The question is, should I use the stall,
but then get a lawyer who's more with it?

286
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,600
You heard about this thing with Phil and John?

287
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,500
- Bobby said something about this.
- That you're losing money, probably.

288
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:43,000
- I am? How much?
- I don't know, you gotta talk to him.

289
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,700
Does John do your collections?

290
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,400
Look, Uncle Jun', what do you think?

291
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,200
Phil beat one of my guys
to within an inch of his life.

292
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:01,717
Next time he'll kill somebody.

293
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:04,200
What can I do? It's my cousin.

294
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,400
Did I give them
the office address or the home?

295
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,065
- I'm talking to you.
- He had a stroke.

296
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,600
You want it to go to the wrong place?
It's fruit, it'll rot.

297
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,200
I pinned myself into a corner here,
and I don't see a way out.

298
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,850
But he wasn't made, right?

299
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:29,400
The kid... Phil's son.

300
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
It's OK, forget it.

301
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,200
I'm sorry.
I'm fuckin' nonplussed with all this news.

302
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:43,400
Frankly, I don't know.

303
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,100
You're going a little squirrelly in this house.

304
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,400
- Tell Phil.
- Tell Phil what?

305
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,000
Where you going?

306
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,500
- You wanted to confer with me?
- Nah, it's not important.

307
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,700
Make sure you eat a lunch today.

308
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,700
Poor fuckin' Feech La Manna.

309
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,265
Tony sent the wrong ex-con back to jail.

310
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,500
You realise I had an entire container of
imported provolone coming in Saturday?

311
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:35,765
And fuckin' Phil and them put it on a truck,

312
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,500
took it to Westchester instead of Rahway
where we always split the loads.

313
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:41,767
Jesus. That shit is liquid gold.

314
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:43,965
Tony knows what has to be done.

315
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,900
Tell John where to find Blundetto.
He just won't do it.

316
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,900
As if he even knows where Tony B is.

317
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,500
Give me a fuckin' break. Of course he knows.

318
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:53,965
- It's Christopher I feel for.
- Please!

319
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,800
Let me tell ya something.
Soprano is very adroit

320
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,500
at keeping his family outta the frying pan.

321
00:25:59,535 --> 00:26:01,800
Both cousins. The rest of us...

322
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,600
How's life now that you're back home?

323
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,200
I had a dream a couple of weeks ago.

324
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,000
Before I moved back, a recurring dream.

325
00:26:21,035 --> 00:26:23,800
I see my old coach from high school.

326
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:26,000
What happens?

327
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,500
He told me back then, this guy, he said...

328
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,600
- he said that I was special.
- You never told me this.

329
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,365
Why now?

330
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,900
Does everything
I drag in here gotta be a dead dog?

331
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,000
I went to see my son's football coach.

332
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,300
See, he was starting my boy and now...
the coach is going to this other kid more.

333
00:26:56,335 --> 00:26:58,465
What's the reason?

334
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,400
Well, AJ's just devoting
more energy to academics.

335
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:04,000
He's determined to get into a good school.

336
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,100
How's things on other fronts?

337
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:13,200
Your cousin?

338
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,700
Well, you touched
on something there that's not so good.

339
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,200
- What's the problem?
- I really can't talk to you about it.

340
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,350
This is very difficult for me, treating you,

341
00:27:26,385 --> 00:27:29,400
when so much of your life is closed off.

342
00:27:29,435 --> 00:27:31,100
How many times can I say this?

343
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,400
Look, I'm not trying to be difficult here.

344
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,665
It's just that it affects me tremendously,

345
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,100
this trouble he's gotten himself into,
so I'm upset!

346
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:41,000
Well...

347
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,900
- And I care about him so much.
- You care about him so much?

348
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:49,200
We spent hours getting to the realisation

349
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,500
that your feelings for your cousin stem
from guilt and shame.

350
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:56,200
Do you remember that? Do you care?

351
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,400
It's just that it doesn't matter now...

352
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,900
It's just that here we are, as always,
back at square one,

353
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:06,167
with you going into high-sentimentality mode.

354
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:09,400
Sentimentality mode?
We were children together!

355
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,100
Look, it's a lot like with your son.

356
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,865
Here's what I bet the coach didn't tell you.

357
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:22,100
What you wanted to hear most
is that your son is special too.

358
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,200
What I'm saying is, whatever you wanna do,

359
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,600
vis-à-vis your cousin, your son, whoever,
own your feelings!

360
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,500
- I'm very confused.
- But... we can't talk about it.

361
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,300
It's my mess.

362
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,600
All my choices were wrong.

363
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,500
- How much?
- It's five bucks.

364
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,500
Your cup's your admission pass.

365
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,200
- Where are they from?
- Montville.

366
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,900
They gotta go.

367
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:19,365
Totally.

368
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,365
- Hello?
- Chiara!

369
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,100
No, you gotta come up Greenbrook Road.

370
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,000
Patrick said to tell you some people have
bogus cups.

371
00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:31,900
They brought them with them
to get out of paying.

372
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,500
- Hey, man, let me see your cup.
- It's in the Athletic Department.

373
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,700
We're getting ripped off.
This isn't downloading music.

374
00:29:42,735 --> 00:29:45,500
That beer is our property unless you pay for it.

375
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,000
Fucking manners!

376
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,800
Speak.

377
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,700
Hello.

378
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,600
- Who is it?
- Open this door!

379
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,465
I wanna talk to you.

380
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,800
I hear you got some beefs.

381
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,400
Do you wanna phone everybody?

382
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,800
What the fuck?

383
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:34,100
I know you said you wanted it burnt, T,
but the picture moved me.

384
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,400
Cos you knew it cost me an arm and a leg.

385
00:31:37,435 --> 00:31:39,800
It's museum-quality work, I admit that.

386
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,000
But I told the guys a chance to hang
a picture of you on my wall?

387
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,900
I rescued it from the flames.

388
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,700
What's with the hat and shit?

389
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,500
Don't give me "huh".
You know what it does to me?

390
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,300
- To be reminded of that fuckin' horse?
- I'm sorry, T.

391
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,400
But you never come here no more.
I didn't figure there'd be a problem.

392
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,700
I never come here no more
cos they're watching all our houses.

393
00:32:07,735 --> 00:32:10,800
- It's no good for us to visit.
- I know.

394
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,500
Do you and your whores get a big laugh?

395
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,800
- That's no joke.
- Then what is it?

396
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,400
That's no joke! That cost me a lotta
money to get the retouching done.

397
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:28,100
What the fuck did you do it for?
And don't bullshit me, Paulie.

398
00:32:28,135 --> 00:32:32,000
Part of it was to fix some fire damage
on the guy's feet.

399
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:34,317
But while I was at it, I also thought,

400
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,600
I don't have a modern look in here,

401
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,065
so go with something more traditional,

402
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,465
that catches more of what you're all about.

403
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,300
- A goddamn lawn jockey?
- That's not a lawn jockey.

404
00:32:46,335 --> 00:32:48,100
That's a general.

405
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,700
What general? Who?

406
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,600
It's not a real general from history, it's you.

407
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
What the fuck.

408
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,300
Speak.

409
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,300
He's at 146, Route 9A, Kinderhook.

410
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,200
- Skip.
- How's it going?

411
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,000
We got you your bialys and coffee.

412
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,100
Johnny Sack called for you.
Called a couple of times.

413
00:37:21,135 --> 00:37:23,300
He seemed upset about something.

414
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,900
- Good bialy.
- Any time, boss.

415
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,700
Catch ya later.

416
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,200
Take it easy, Tone.

417
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,050
- What?
- It didn't solve a thing.

418
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:27,465
- It's over, John.
- The fuck it is!

419
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,765
- He's beside himself now.
- The best thing for him,

420
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,000
for you, for all of us, is to put this thing behind
us and get back to business.

421
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,000
- How is that supposed to happen?
- It's something we gotta talk about.

422
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,500
As a first step, I'd consider giving Phil

423
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,900
a quarter of my points in the Bloomfield
operation, which my cousin was running.

424
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm at Columbia Pres all day,
my yearly physical.

425
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,665
An hour already, I'm waiting for this doctor.

426
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,500
Then I got bone density tests, lipids.
Come into the city tonight.

427
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,300
No offence, John, but I got
an IQ of 136. It's been tested.

428
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,400
All right. Tomorrow morning then,
my house, 6:30.

429
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:12,100
- What?
- I'm on a 9.00 a. m. flight to Miami.

430
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,065
I have to get things in line there.

431
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,700
You think I'm gonna give you
ammazzo with Ginny upstairs?

432
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,900
- If you don't hear from me, I'll be there.
- Tony, you and you alone.

433
00:39:26,935 --> 00:39:29,400
I'm not having Phil, nobody.

434
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,800
- Who is it?
- It's me.

435
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,400
You need to go up to the farm
and pick up your cousin.

436
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,800
I need you to go up there now, this morning.

437
00:40:07,835 --> 00:40:10,600
It may be over, but watch your back.

438
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,200
Take him off the premises, obviously.

439
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,300
He should be buried.

440
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,300
It should be you that does it.

441
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:25,400
You got it.

442
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,300
We never got
a chance to talk in detail about Adriana.

443
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,900
I know.

444
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,100
If you let something slip,

445
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,300
if she saw anything...

446
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,200
There was a couple of times
I had her with me picking up collections.

447
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,100
Esplanade.

448
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,300
The cigarettes...
she was always nosing around.

449
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,100
Did you ever say anything
about Ralph or the Bevelaqua kid?

450
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:16,700
- No.
- Would you remember?

451
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:18,400
I swear on my life.

452
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,500
- You won't find any of that.
- I'm reading, I'm lifting weights.

453
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,700
I know what you think but you'll see.
I'm gonna prove myself to you.

454
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:48,700
I only chipped that once, on the day with her.

455
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,100
She was willing to rat me out
because she couldn't do five fuckin' years?

456
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:04,500
- I thought she loved me.
- She's a cunt.

457
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,100
Does no good to think about that now.

458
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,100
All right.

459
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
He does like her.

460
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,100
Cos he told me.

461
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,600
- I have heard you talking all night.
- Could you knock?

462
00:42:46,635 --> 00:42:49,065
You said you'd finish your application.

463
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,800
You're gonna stroke out if you
can't find a way to control yourself.

464
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,500
- I know.
- Hang that phone up.

465
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,500
Call me back later?

466
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,665
I don't know what to say, you know?

467
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,900
If applications are late,
you are cooked. It's that simple.

468
00:43:06,935 --> 00:43:09,600
I know this because I have
raised you from day one,

469
00:43:09,635 --> 00:43:11,665
you won't like working at McDonald's.

470
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,365
- Could you up the drama a little?
- You know what?

471
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,600
I don't like the sarcasm,
and I don't want you around here

472
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,765
next year sponging off of us, so fine.

473
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,700
No allowance
until those applications are done.

474
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:25,500
That's not even practical and you know it.

475
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,900
- What's the matter?
- He hasn't done his applications.

476
00:43:28,935 --> 00:43:31,500
- He isn't getting allowance.
- No allowance.

477
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,300
- I have $300 of my own money.
- How?

478
00:43:34,335 --> 00:43:36,365
Me and Matt put on a party.

479
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,600
$5 a person. We made 600 bucks
after expenses.

480
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,565
- What expenses?
- The band.

481
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,565
Is that why you've been on the phone
for two weeks?

482
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,900
It may interest you to know
people said it was the best party all year.

483
00:43:49,935 --> 00:43:53,400
- There was drinking?
- We just let people into Matt's house.

484
00:43:53,435 --> 00:43:57,100
What they brought with them
was not under our control.

485
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,900
Do your applications. Now.

486
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,400
- What?
- You know, it's interesting.

487
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,300
I was talking to his college advisor...

488
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,665
Who, Wegler?

489
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,100
No, AJ got switched around. Miss Merrow.

490
00:44:23,135 --> 00:44:26,465
She mentioned that AJ talked to her once

491
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,500
about what might be good schools
to study event planning.

492
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,100
Event planning?

493
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,850
What the hell is it?

494
00:44:40,885 --> 00:44:43,400
I am not really sure.

495
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,365
- Gay, isn't it?
- I don't know.

496
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,000
I know you're around a lot of wealthy people.

497
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,200
He watches that DVD over and over again.

498
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,100
The one with Mike Myers about...
What's his name?

499
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,200
- Steve Rubell, the Studio 54 guy?
- Oh, Jesus.

500
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,100
Yeah, but I mean, you know, it...

501
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,400
Well, I guess, you know...

502
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,500
I don't know.

503
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,900
He's fired up about something at least.

504
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,400
So? Go ahead.

505
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,100
Phil has to know that punishment has been
meted out and that's all there is.

506
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,700
And that what we are here for, in the end,

507
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:20,500
is to put food on the table for our families,
our sons, the future.

508
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,000
- That's what's important.
- He doesn't accept that.

509
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:25,865
His family's smaller by one.

510
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,100
Well, then, my friend,
it's up to you to make him accept it.

511
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,065
- Me?
- Let's talk, John,

512
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,865
about the 500-pound elephant in the room.

513
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,400
You started this cycle of bloodshed when you
whacked the girl Carmine used to fuck.

514
00:46:38,435 --> 00:46:40,500
Lorraine Calluzzo was not a girl,

515
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,400
and what kind of a man
bangs his second cousin?

516
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,800
What are you, the frigging cardinal?

517
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,365
You wanna shut down
our joint construction jobs?

518
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,365
Eat K-rations? Fine. You want Phil
to put one in one of my guys?

519
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,500
That's gonna go a long way to making you
the rich prick that you want to be.

520
00:46:58,535 --> 00:47:01,967
- What do you suggest?
- Whatever his legitimate sorrow,

521
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:05,400
he's got a price.
He wants to provide for his family.

522
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,265
- And?
- And what?

523
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,565
Meet his price, and that's it.

524
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,400
- I don't wanna hear nothing else.
- Oh, you don't?

525
00:47:13,435 --> 00:47:17,300
I've paid enough, John. I've paid a lot.

526
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,600
Maybe I could sell it.

527
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,700
Truth is we've had discussions.
I gave him the sports book.

528
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,200
Why didn't you say that, you cheap fuck?

529
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,200
Cos I don't like it.
He's gonna want consigliere or...

530
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,900
Let's not go backwards now.

531
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,465
These people you run into
who wanna be boss, huh?

532
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,500
- They should know.
- I told you. You don't listen, you nut.

533
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,700
It's good... seeing you again.

534
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,800
I still look forward
to working with you, John. I mean that.

535
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,700
- You want a coffee?
- Oh, I don't know.

536
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,400
Fuckin' Christ!

537
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,500
FBI, open up!

538
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,900
Oh, my God!

539
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,700
I'm the gardener.

540
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,200
Absolutely, put him on.

541
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,400
The Feds just hit Johnny Sack.
You heard anything?

542
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,300
I had Gendler on my cell phone
all the way over here.

543
00:50:13,335 --> 00:50:15,265
Jimmy Petrille was a collaborator.

544
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,500
They took down
the whole Petrille crew plus Johnny.

545
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,500
Would've reached Carmine Senior
if he hadn't died.

546
00:50:21,535 --> 00:50:24,600
Jimmy Petrille? He's a sweet old guy.

547
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,500
He gave them gambling,
homicides, trafficking...

548
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:29,165
18 fuckin' years' worth.

549
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,300
It's a major kreplach, my friend.

550
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,050
- I was fuckin' there.
- What, where?

551
00:50:34,085 --> 00:50:36,542
Johnny's house. My car's in the driveway.

552
00:50:36,577 --> 00:50:38,965
I'm walking three miles towards my house.

553
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,700
No law against parking your car
unless it's in front of a hydrant.

554
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,500
- I'm not laughing, Neil.
- No, of course not.

555
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,400
Anyway, you weren't named
in the indictment, obviously.

556
00:50:51,435 --> 00:50:53,865
It's Brooklyn. They weren't coming for you.

557
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:58,300
So frankly, were I you,
I might actually consider laughing.

558
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,000
Or rub a hunchback's hump. Or something.

559
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,400
- Yeah.
- Be of good cheer.

560
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,200
Call you when I hear more.

561
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,400
What happened to you?
And your shoes are soaking wet.

562
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,800
English
