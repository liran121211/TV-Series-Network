Junior and Phil Leotardo both make moves to gain power in their respective territories.", "Paulie shows up at Tony's house to tell him he's learned the Feds are looking into a murder case from the early 1980s. In fact it was Tony's first killing where he made his 'bones'. Tony decides he and Paulie need to lay low for a while and they head off on a road trip to Florida. They reminisce about the old days but Paulie is definitely getting on Tony's nerves. They also find that many things along the route have changed over the years. Tony is particularly interested in knowing who may have told Johnny Sack about the fat joke directed at his wife. Uncle Junior meanwhile has taken to organizing a poker game with his new friend Carter Chong. Junior's as grumpy as ever but continues to suffer from memory loss from time to time. Carter likes Junior's rebellious attitude but things change when the doctors change Junior's meds and he becomes far more docile.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0979769", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 7526, "number_of_episodes": 86}
