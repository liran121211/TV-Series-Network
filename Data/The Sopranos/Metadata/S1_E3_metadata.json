A local hotel owner seeks out Tony's help in dealing with his son-in-law who is refusing to give the man's daughter a divorce unless he gets half of the family business. Silvio and Paulie pay him a visit but he's proving to be just a little hard to convince.

The young man, however, proves difficult to convince. Carmela, meanwhile, hires Artie and Charmaine to cater at an auction being held at the Soprano house. Her disdainful treatment of them angers Charmaine, leading her to reveal a secret past she shared with Tony. As Meadow and Hunter prepare for a choir recital and the SATs, they find the workload overwhelming and turn to Chris to supply them with uppers.
