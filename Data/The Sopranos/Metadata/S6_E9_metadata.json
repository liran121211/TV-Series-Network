Christopher tries to start a new life as a husband and father.", "It's time for the annual church f\u00eate and as usual Paulie is responsible for the 5 day affair. It's always been a money maker for Paulie - Tony's father, Johnny Soprano, had control of it before him - but a new parish priest thinks that the $10,000 Paulie contributes as the church's share is too low and thinks $50,000 would be more appropriate. Paulie balks at the figure, at least in part he says because his own costs have been rising. One thing he does to save money is to hire second-rate carnival rides, something that comes back to haunt him when one of the rides breaks down and people are injured. Paulie is also under a great deal of stress after his doctor doesn't like the results of his PSA test and schedules a biopsy. When Christopher's girlfriend Kelly tells him she's pregnant, he asks her to marry him. He's still fighting his addiction however and falls off the wagon.\u2014garykmcd", "Paulie, who is in charge of organizing the local festival for St. Elzear, has an argument with the local priest over how much of cut the church will be taking. When Paulie refuses the father's demands, he is told that they will not be able to use the church's golden hat traditionally worn by the statue of St. Elzear during the festival. Later, the conspicuous absence of the hat is noted by many, and when a children's ride collapses because of shoddy maintenance fingers are pointed at Paulie for putting the kids in danger for his own profit. In addition to this, Paulie learns that he may have cancer. Chris, meanwhile, learns that his girlfriend is pregnant, and immediately proposes to her. His bachelor party, however, gets out of hand as Chris once more begins shooting heroin. At the same time, Adriana's mother throws around accusations that Chris murdered her daughter. Tony does his best to convince Carmela of Chris' innocence, but Adriana is still nowhere to be found.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705281", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 7454, "number_of_episodes": 86}
