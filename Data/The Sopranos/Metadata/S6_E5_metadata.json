It's a happy day for himself and his wife though he still has time to get a little work done. Johnny wants Tony to eliminate someone for him and Tony reluctantly agrees.

The Marshals are pretty strict with Johnny about leaving on time and when they drag him away before his daughter and her new husband leave the reception he breaks down and cries. Phil Leotardo describes him as a weakling. Tony has been worrying about how his own men perceive him and decides it's time to remind them that his recent surgery hasn't made him any less of a man. Two hoods making a collection in a gay bar see Vito dancing with another man and wearing his leathers.\u2014garykmcd", "Johnny Sack is granted a six-hour release from prison for his daughter's wedding, and many of the families are in attendance. Johnny's emotional reaction at the wedding gives the others doubts about how well he can keep from cracking under pressure and turning informant. During the party, Vito leaves early, ostensibly because of illness, but then heads out to a gay bar where he picks up a stranger. When two gang members arrive to make collections and recognize him, Vito realizes that his secret is out. Tony, meanwhile, is worrying about his own weakness, which he feels acutely in comparison to his muscle-bound new bodyguard.
