Doctors are pessimistic and have told Carmela to prepare for the worst. Syl takes temporary charge of the family and with Tony's poor prognosis, sees himself as his natural heir. Carmela, Meadow, a somewhat reluctant AJ and several captains maintain a 24 hour vigil. As for Tony, he dreams he is a businessman on a trip to California. Unfortunately, he seems to have taken someones briefcase and wallet by mistake. He has no identification and only a small amount of cash on him. As a result of the mix-up everyone thinks he someone by the name of Finnerty, including two Tibetan monks who are dissatisfied with the heating and cooling system he sold them.\u2014garykmcd", "In Intensive Care after being shot by Junior, Tony is placed into an induced coma for his own protection. While unconscious, he enters a long and detailed dream, in which he is takes the identity of a completely different person, with a different name, profession, attitude and a different wife. In his dream (in which his name becomes Kevin Finnerty), a doctor tells him he has suffered brain damage and is in danger of developing Alzheimer's. In the real world, the doctor's explain to Carmela that Tony's outlook is very uncertain, and that even if he survives, he may suffer permanent harm.
