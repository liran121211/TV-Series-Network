There are problems at one of Uncle Junior's construction site when a civil rights activist begins protests over the few African-Americans on the work site. Tony sends a message to his uncle via Bobby Baccalieri about who is in charge. For his part, Uncle Junior gets bail but is subject to house arrest and has to wear an electronic bracelet.
