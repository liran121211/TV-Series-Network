With everybody hurting financially, Paulie takes it on himself to speak to Carmine and try to settle the dispute. He has a rude awakening when he realizes Carmine has no idea who he is. Out on the town with Tony and a few women, Furio is disgusted and very nearly takes a fatal step. He leaves suddenly for Italy without saying goodbye to anyone and Carmela is depressed over his sudden disappearance. Meadow hosts a dinner at her new apartment for her parents but it's apparent that Carmela is not happy. Meanwhile, an outing with his mother and two of her friends drives Paulie to extremes.\u2014garykmcd", "Carmela and Furio continue to flirt with each other. Each time they meet, Carmela feels herself wanting to go further, but Furio holds back either from respect or fear of Tony. Carmela confesses her feelings to Meadow, which puts her daughter in an awkward position when Tony later goes to her asking if her mother is concerned about anything. Paulie, meanwhile, is falling behind in his payments to the gang. He brushes off Silvio's warnings, saying he's an important enough member of the gang that his long history with Tony will smooth over any shortcomings in payments. He gets a shock, however, when he tries to help Tony by talking with Carmine, and finds that Carmine doesn't even know who he is. Realizing that his position may not be as stable as he thought, he gets desperate to come up with his needed cash.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705242", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 7336, "number_of_episodes": 86}
