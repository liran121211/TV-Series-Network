Tony is non-committal and they arrange to meet again. Before that happens, Phil Leotardo learns Vito is back in town and exacts his revenge. Tony sees this as Phil's attempt to exert some control over the New Jersey family. Tony's about had it with AJ loafing around and gets him a regular construction job at the Esplanade work site. Carmela and Rosalie Aprile go off to Paris for a holiday. They are just in awe of the city and Carmela begins to wonder about their place in the world.

While Tony is willing to just let Vito leave quietly, Phil is still out for blood. Pretending to set up a meeting with Vito to discuss his future, Phil ambushes him in his hotel room and has him beaten to death. Tony later expresses his concern to Silvio that that the killing of Vito was Phil's way of challenging Tony's authority. Meanwhile, Carmela and Rosalie go on a trip to Paris together, where Rosalie becomes philosophical about the loss of her husband and son. Back at home, Anthony earns his father's wrath by getting fired from yet another job for stealing, then trying to pass off his actions as purely motivated.
