Christopher hears it from an acquaintance at an AA meeting and soon passes it on to the other members of the family. Most are disgusted with him but Tony isn't about to rush to judgment where a man's reputation is at stake. It all seems like it's true when Benny Fazio approaches him and Vito takes off in his car. When Meadow overhears her mother and Rosalie Aprile talking about it, she tells them - and eventually her father - what Finn saw the morning he got to work early. As for Vito, he is in hiding in a small New Hampshire town hoping to track down his cousin who lives somewhere in the state. Vito begins to notice that there are obviously other gay men living in the town.\u2014garykmcd", "The two gang members who saw Vito in a gay bar are spreading their story around. When word reaches Tony, he is initially skeptical of the tale and insists that more evidence is needed to make a conclusive decision. However, after hearing about Vito fleeing when some of Tony's men go to talk with him, as well as learning of what Finn witnessed at the construction site, Tony becomes convinced. Knowing that the conservative mobsters will probably have him killed for his perceived betrayal, Vito packs his things and flees north, eventually getting stuck in a small town in New Hampshire. Far from his familiar territory, Vito begins exploring and meeting people. Meadow, meanwhile, is angry at her father for his attitude toward gays, as well as to his flippant dismissal of an Afghan family her law firm is representing.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705259", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 7362, "number_of_episodes": 86}
