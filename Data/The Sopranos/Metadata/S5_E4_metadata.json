AJ's grades are dropping and a visit to his school guidance counselor, Robert Wegler, doesn't give much hope for college unless his grades improve. Carmela feels she's being undermined by Tony who is always buying the boy gifts and after AJ disobeys her yet again, she lets him move in with Tony. She also gets a call from Wegler who asks her out for lunch. Tony meanwhile is still trying to woo Dr. Melfi.\u2014garykmcd", "Feech, wanting to regain the power he once held before he went to prison, continues muscling in on operations being run now by members of Tony's crew. It's not long before Tony must conclude that Feech will never pay him the respect that the rest of the mobsters do, and that the old-timer is causing more trouble than he is worth. With Chris' help, Tony arranges for Feech to be taken out of everyone's hair. At the same time, Johnny Sack is continuing to press his new claims against Little Carmine's operations, having his thugs murder a loan shark and her partner. To avenge this insult, Carmine begins plotting to kill Johnny's men. At home, meanwhile, Anthony's grades have been steadily sliding downward, as has his attitude toward his mother. Tony doesn't help matters with the lavish gifts he gives his son as a substitute for fathering. At her wit's end about what to do with her son, Carmela has a dinner meeting with Anthony's teacher that begins turning more personal.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705226", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 7394, "number_of_episodes": 86}
