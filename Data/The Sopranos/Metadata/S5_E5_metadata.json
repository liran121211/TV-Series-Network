Tony develops feelings for her but he does his best to resist his urges. He feels quite guilty about it all, which sends him back to see Dr. Melfi after a long break. After the club's closing early one morning they set off together to find Adriana's coke dealer but have a car accident when Tony swerves to avoid an animal on the road. They're not seriously injured but it doesn't take long for rumors to surface, all to the effect that they were having sex in his car. When Christopher returns from an out of town business trip and hears what's happened, he goes berserk, forcing Tony to take a drastic and near-fatal step. It's Tony Blundetto who comes up with the evidence needed to convince Christopher that everything is above board. Carmela meanwhile is now sleeping with AJ's school guidance counselor.\u2014garykmcd", "Tony begins hanging out at The Crazy Horse, Adriana's club, where he and Adriana spend time together. The two begin bonding over mutual worries and doing drugs together, which leads to rumors of a sexual dalliance when they get into a car wreck together in Tony's SUV. When Chris hears the rumors he beats up Adriana, despite her protests of innocence, and comes gunning for Tony. As Tony takes his hot-headed nephew out to an abandoned road, it looks like Chris has finally thrown his last tantrum. But then Cousin Tony, using his massage-therapist credentials, convinces a doctor to tell Chris that Adriana was wearing her seat belt at the time of the crash, and therefore couldn't have been in the position she was rumored to be in when Tony rolled the car. Convinced that Adriana and Tony aren't involved with each other, Chris calms down, but is still upset about the rumors that continue to spread behind his back.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705255", "rating": 9.3, "votes": 9441, "number_of_episodes": 86}
