He knows that Phil Leotardo will no doubt kill Tony B. very slowly and so Tony offers to do it himself. Johnny says there's no way anyone but Phil gets to kill him. If Tony doesn't do so quickly, a member of Tony's family will be killed and not surprisingly, Christopher interprets that he would be that victim and goes into hiding. Adriana meanwhile is still in the clutches of the FBI and this time they get very serious after she is filmed disposing evidence of a crime. She admits that Matoush the drug dealer killed someone in her office and she cleaned up after the fact even though the killing had nothing to do with her. They tell her that unless she can get Christopher to flip, she will be arrested and charged. She tells Chris what's happened and he tells her they're both dead and have no way out of the predicament she's put them in.\u2014garykmcd", "With Tony Blundetto on the run after killing Billy Leotardo, Tony Soprano meets with Johnny Sack to see if there is any way to avoid an all-out war between the two gangs. Johnny makes the obvious request: hand over Tony Blundetto or else other members of the Soprano family will be killed in retaliation. As a counter-offer, Tony asks to kill his cousin himself, so that at least he can spare him unnecessary suffering. Johnny rejects the offer, insisting that the killing be done his way. Tony storms out of the talks in anger. Meanwhile, Adriana is spotted by the FBI trying to hide evidence of a killing that took place inside her club. Threatened with another long jail sentence, she pleads for a chance to convince Chris to turn informant with her, which they agree to. She goes to her fianc\u00e9 and fearfully tells him what she's been doing, and asks him to please join her.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705260", "rating": 9.7, "votes": 13101, "number_of_episodes": 86}
