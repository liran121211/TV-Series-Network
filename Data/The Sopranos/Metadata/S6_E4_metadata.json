Paulie receives a shock about his mother.", "Tony has regained consciousness but is not yet feeling like himself. The owner of Barone sanitation has died and his son Jason wants to sell the company but Tony advises against it. The potential buyer is affiliated with Johnny Sack and Tony wants to make sure he gets the cut he thinks he deserves. Johnny Sack doesn't quite agree with the amounts requested. Tony makes it clear that Jason Barone is responsible for coming with the cash he expects. Paulie is shocked when his Aunt Dotty, a nun, tells him that she gave birth to him when she was a novitiate and that the woman he thought was his mother is actually his aunt. He feel that he's been lied to and somehow cheated of ever knowing his real mother. Bobby Baccala meanwhile enters into a strange pact with a rapper.\u2014garykmcd", "After waking up from his coma, Tony's condition begins to improve and he is eventually discharged. His outlook on life appears to have changed somewhat as he lets small slights pass by that he would have earlier reacted violently toward. His first order of business after getting out is dealing with Barone Sanitation, the company he ostensibly is a consultant for. The owner has died, and his son has attempted to sell the company without Tony's approval. The buyer, however, is connected with Johnny Sack, making pulling out of the deal problematic. Paulie, meanwhile, goes to the deathbed of his aunt only to be shocked by her confession that she is actually his mother. The news that she and her sister lied about his parentage comes as a tremendous blow to him, and he does not take the news well.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705277", "rating": 8.4, "votes": 7438, "number_of_episodes": 86}
