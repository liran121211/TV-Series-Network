Sitting behind a desk all day doesn't go over too easily however. He has yet more problems to solve however when he learns that Richie Aprile has at least one of his drivers selling cocaine along his garbage route. Tony orders Richie to stop what he's doing but not surprisingly that doesn't sit well with him. Uncle Junior meanwhile meets the widow of an old friend who would clearly like to spend some time with him.

When he takes up with the widow of a friend (whom he meets at the hospital), he at first tries to hide the fact that he's not allowed to go outside. Eventually, though, he comes clean to find that she's fine with his past. Tony, meanwhile, having earlier escaped prosecution for Matt's murder when the witness fearfully withdrew his testimony, is advised by his lawyer to start acting like he has an actual job instead of spending all day at the Bada Bing. Sitting behind a desk at Barone Sanitation quickly becomes boring, however, and Tony starts looking for new diversions.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705252", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 8349, "number_of_episodes": 86}
