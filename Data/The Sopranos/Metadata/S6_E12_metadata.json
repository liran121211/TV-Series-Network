He isn't quite sure how to tell Tony but that's the least of his problems: they're regularly smoking heroin. Tony decides the time has come for a little retaliation against Phil Leotardo over what he did to Vito and arranges to have one of his wire stores blown up. Before it all gets out of hand, Carmine Jr. arranges a meeting between the two sides. It seems to be going okay but doesn't end well. Phil's men urge him to do something about the Soprano family but before he can do so, Phil finds himself in the hospital. AJ goes out on a date with Blanca and they begin a relationship. AJ says he has no problem with the fact that she has a three year old boy but it doesn't go over well with Tony and Carmela at Christmas-time.\u2014garykmcd", "Tony arranges a surprise for Phil in retaliation for his disrespect with regard for Vito. Later, Chris mentions to Tony that he has a new mistress, but conceals the fact that it's Julianna, the real estate agent that Tony had been hitting on earlier. Tony's rejection of her just before they were about to have sex drove her to start drinking again, leading to her and Chris meeting up at AA. Things are going smoothly for them, but their combined addictive drives start building on each other and they are soon doing hard drugs together. Anthony, meanwhile, starts up a relationship with an older woman named Blanca. When he invites her home for dinner, Carmela expresses her displeasure to Tony over Blanca's race and 3-year-old son, but Tony is happy to see his son starting to act like a responsible adult.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0793256", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 7203, "number_of_episodes": 86}
