Tony takes Christopher to task for not being around much. Christopher explains the temptations at places like the Bing but Tony is anything but sympathetic. Christopher is soon drinking again and it leads to tragedy. Tony tells Agent Dwight Harris about the two Muslims who used to hang around the Bing but who seem to have suddenly become observant.
