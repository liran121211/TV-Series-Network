Carmela starts trying to invest in her future.", "Adriana is increasingly worried about Christopher. He and others are conducting more and more of their business at the club and sometimes, she can't even get in to use her office. Christopher's heroin habit seems to be getting worse. Then of course she has the FBI on her back for more information. They're calling her to meetings and tell her a few home truths. They also want her to get more information on Tony. Janice decides that widower Bobby Bacala needs taking care of and she pushes her way into his house and his family. Bobby is inconsolable however and is still blaming himself for his wife's death. There's a bit of chill in the air when Tony refuses to set up an insurance trust that Carmela's cousin Brian recommends. Tony is far more interested in Ralph's investment, a racehorse by the name of Pie-O-My, especially after the horse wins a race at 8-1. At his trial, Uncle Junior is upset over the courtroom artist's rendition of him.\u2014garykmcd", "As an investment, Ralph buys a racehorse named Pie-O-My. The horse actually turns out to be a good earner for Ralph, and Tony manages to make a bit himself through his strategies for picking bets at the track. Although Ralph has no qualms about getting rough with the horse if he thinks it will make her run faster, Tony actually gets attached to the animal, becoming emotionally shaken when she falls ill. Carmela, meanwhile, is concerned about the possibility of having to support herself, and asks Tony to help her make some investments, or at least sign a life insurance policy.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705271", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 7604, "number_of_episodes": 86}
