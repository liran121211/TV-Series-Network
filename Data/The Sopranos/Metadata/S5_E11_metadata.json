He and the older Angelo had become good friends in prison with the older mobster becoming something of a father figure to him. Tony B. kills Phil Leotardo's kid brother Billy and then goes on the run. Tired of it all and realizing that they're on the verge of an all-out war, Tony goes into New York City and books himself into the Plaza. There he has a strange dream, one that includes the living, the dead and even Annette Bening. It all helps him to decide that the time has come to eliminate his favorite cousin.\u2014garykmcd", "Tony Blundetto is seething with anger over the death of his good friend Angelo. Apparently, while Angelo was shopping for a present for his grandchild, Phil and Billy Leotardo, members of Johnny Sack's crew, ambushed him, killing him in the trunk of Phil's car. When Tony Soprano hears about the murder, he immediately tries to contact his cousin, but there is no answer; Tony has already gone to avenge Angelo's death. Tony Soprano goes to sleep, and goes into a long dream, in which important figures of his past who are now dead, including Big Pussy, Carmine, Mikey Palmice, Jackie Aprile, and even Pie-O-My, appear to him. Eventually, the dream figures explain to Tony the painful truth he has obviously known but not acknowledged: he must kill his cousin Tony or else face a long and bloody gang war between the families.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705285", "rating": 8.6, "votes": 9486, "number_of_episodes": 86}
