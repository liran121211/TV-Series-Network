Artie feuds with Benny after his restaurant falls prey to one of Tony's scams.", "Artie Bucco is having trouble with his restaurant. His sales are down 40% from the previous year and many of his regular customers have found a new Italian restaurant that is more to their liking. Things get worse when investigators from Amex arrive to tell him that credit card numbers are being stolen from the restaurant. When he learns that it's one of Christopher's crew who is involved, it leads to a fight and requires Tony's intervention. Tony blames the whole situation on Christopher, who is off to Los Angeles with Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. to see if they can interest Ben Kingsley in starring in their movie. It's pretty apparent that he's not interested, but Christopher doesn't get the signals. Christopher is amazed at the swag stars receive and is desperate to get some of his own. Lauren Bacall proves to be the source, though not in a conventional way.\u2014garykmcd", "Chris and Little Carmine head out to Hollywood to pursue Chris' dream of making a movie about his life. They manage to get an interview with Ben Kingsley, but the star isn't impressed with their idea. While in town, Chris falls off the wagon and starts drinking and doing drugs again, and also mugs Lauren Bacall before returning to New Jersey. Back home, the families are celebrating as the books open again to induct two new members, Gerry Torciano and Burt Gervasi. Amidst the festivities, however, Artie gets into a confrontation with Benny, one of Chris' crew-members, first over his affections for Artie's new waitress Martina, then later when Artie discovers that Martina and Benny have been stealing credit card numbers from the restaurant's customers. When things turn violent between the two, Tony must step in and mediate, saving particular criticism for Chris for going to Hollywood rather than keeping his men under control.\u2014Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0705261", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 7380, "number_of_episodes": 86}
