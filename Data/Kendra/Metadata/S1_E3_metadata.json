While Kendra is gone, Hank stays home and cleans up the house. Jonny Makeup comes by to bring Kendra some clothes, but since she isn't home, Hank puts Jonny to work cleaning up after the dogs. In Las Vegas, Kendra does the photo shoot in the Hugh Hefner Sky Villa at the Palms Casino. Once the shoot is over, Kendra and her friends go indoor skydiving. They like it so much that Kendra and Amber try it topless. Later, back at the villa, some of Kendra's friends come by and they all hang out in the villa's pool. Kendra returns home and is impressed by the clean house, although it becomes clear that the house won't remain clean for long when she starts emptying clothes out of a dresser onto the floor.\u2014Anonymous"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1467619", "rating": 7.2, "votes": 9, "number_of_episodes": 45}
