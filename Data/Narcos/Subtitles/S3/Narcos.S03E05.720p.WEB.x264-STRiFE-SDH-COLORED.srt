<i>According to our intelligence,</i>

9
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:10,612
Gilberto Rodríguez was
a stabilizing influence on the cartel.

10
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,783
His arrest may lead
to an increased violence

11
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,995

12
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,413

00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,678

<i>is that any further operation

18

Thank you, sir.

88
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,862
Colonel Martínez deserves the credit.

89
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,906
Unfortunately,
he isn't here to receive it.

90
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,742
He should be.

91
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,079
I imagine he knew there might be
consequences for his actions.

92
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,373
A surrender deal was on the table,

93
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,377
which would've brought all four leaders
of the Cali cartel to justice.

94
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,712
And now, that's been complicated,

95

and we are faced with the unknown.

96
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,384
Understood.

97
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,680
Though I'm not sure murderers negotiating
their own punishment qualifies as justice.

98
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,894
The deal preceded my tenure.

99
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,898
But between the two of us,
I share your reservations.

100
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,235
But no one wants a return
to the days of Pablo Escobar

101
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,237
and the bloodshed of Los Pepes.

102
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,698
No, of course not.

103
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,117

104
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,703
about your involvement
with the vigilantes are true,

105
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,287
but I do have a question.

106
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,543
If it turns out that we are indeed
on the same side...

107
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,670
can I trust you?

108
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,800

I would have gladly met you
in the usual place.

338
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,320
That's what you're worried about?

339
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,825
How about earning the money we pay you
to keep our bosses out of jail?

340
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,786
- You couldn't give a fuck about that.
- The fuck you want from me?

341
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,289
Logistics, planning, the dummy raid.
All that shit came out of Bogotá.

342
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,874
By the time we knew what they were...

343
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:04,503
Martínez had already been
in Gilberto's house for 30 minutes,

344
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,338
you useless piece of shit.

345
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,718
You know what else is odd?

346
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,513
It looks like the DEA never left Cali.

347
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,515
And you were the one who confirmed.

348
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:23,313
You. Only you confirmed those two fucking
gringos took the plane to Bogotá.

349
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,278
Do you know where you are?

350
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,782
You want to hang me out to dry
with your boss? Do you know where you are?

351
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,788
I asked the Americans how they found
Gilberto's house. Know what they told me?

352
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,291
They followed someone there.

353
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,047
I know it wasn't me.

354
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,027
Fucking Calderón.

355
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,988
What he said made sense.

356
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,492
The DEA followed someone
to Gilberto's house.

357
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,746
It must be Pallomari. The DEA knows
who he is and where he works.

358
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,166
They must have come back
and tailed him to Gilberto.

359
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,382
Didn't you say you drove Pallomari
to Gilberto's that night?

360
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,558
It could just as easily have been me
driving him.

361
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,313
Yeah, but it wasn't, was it?

362
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,399
You think Miguel will let this slide?

363
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,153
Not a fucking chance.

364
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,657
Jorge, if this thing comes back on me,
it comes back on you,

365
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,367
and then we're both fucked.

366
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,746
The only thing we need is a name,
and we have it.

367
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:06,083
We have to get on the same page here.

368
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,797
Calderón told us those fuckers from
the DEA got on a plane to Bogotá, right?

369
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,215
He burned us.

370
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,885
He is the one responsible
for what happened.

371
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,179
He's a dirty cop...

372
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,308
who takes money from a drug cartel.

373
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,649
But you and me, we are brothers.

374
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,080
Let me cut to the chase.
My father still wants to retire.

<font color="#80FF00">[GRUNTS]</font>

376
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:54,298
I didn't realize you were taking such
an active role in your father's affairs.

377
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:59,636
No other choice when friends
don't return our lawyer's calls.

378
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,180
Of course.

379
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,434
Well, then...

380
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:12,774
tell your father there is still a path
to what he wants most.

381
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:17,279
No one here is happy
with the current predicament.

382
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:24,036
The DEA blindsided all of us, and it's
been difficult to carry out our old deal.

383
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,788
"Old deal"?

384
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,627
Nicolás...

385
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:37,341
Politics is about appearances.

386
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:42,346
For us, it's extremely difficult
to accept the surrender terms of a man

387
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,847
who's already in prison.

388
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,309
That just looks bad.

389
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,273
But different terms...

390
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,442
new terms...

391
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,862
What do you say?

392
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,333
So what did you find out?

393
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:17,047
The DEA team Calderón was escorting
never left Cali.

394
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,549
He reported that they had.

395
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,264
What do you think, Jorge?

396
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,432
It was a mistake.

397
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,477
Born of incompetence.

398
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,689
The DEA got lucky...

399
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,066
and Calderón took the bait.

400
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,737
Well, we're not paying for incompetence.

401
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,575
Besides, that doesn't explain
how they found my brother.

402
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,079
How did they get that information?
Was that also Calderón?

403
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,082
It's unlikely.

404
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:58,630
It's possible the DEA used
some high-end aerial surveillance.

405
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,681
From here on out, keep an eye on Calderón.

406
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,852
Limit what we tell him.

407
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,771
No more lapses in security.

408
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,398
Yes, sir.

409
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,481

They wouldn't kill a cop.

For you, Uncle Miguel, Pacho, and Chepe.

464
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,469
Three years.

465
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,515
Three years? No chance.

466
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:07,022
You surrender your illegal assets,
do the three years,

467
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,650
and the legitimate assets, the cash,
the business, will all be retained.

468
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:14,237
That's not the deal.
And you won't speak of this again.

470

You don't get to surrender.

You are in jail.

475

00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,332
Tell him what you did.

668
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,669
Tell him. Tell him where we caught you.

669
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,966
While you were visiting
your wife and children,

670
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,803
this fucking rat
was on his way to the airport.

671
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,973
With his wife, bags packed.

672
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,311
About to leave you holding the blame.
Your friend, Jorge.

673
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,397
You had your bitch follow me?

674
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,236
- What did you say?
- Me? And my children?

675
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,281
You should be thankful, motherfucker.

676
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:39,203
It's why you're standing there...
instead of sitting next to him.

677
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,791
You're making a big mistake, David.

678
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,877
I don't give a fuck what you think.

679
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,880
He's a loyal man. He always has been.

680
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,051
- He's a piece of shit, Jorge.
- He's a good man and loyal.

681
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,054
- Good? Why was he running?
- What are you doing?

682
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,597
- This is a good man...
- He's a fucking snitch!

683
00:50:58,681 --> 00:50:59,681
Jorge!

684
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:12,945
Look at me.

685
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,281
Sophia is inside.

686
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,200
She's inside that room.

687
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,205
Don't let them touch her.
Don't let them put a hand on Sophia.

688
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:24,929
She has nothing to do with this, brother.

689
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,751
These fucking bastards are crazy.
They want to...

My brother is in prison
because we were weak.

695

Because mistakes were made.

696
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:29,229
Because we allowed people
to be dishonest with us.

697

These are the consequences.

698
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,868
Mistakes will not be tolerated.

699
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,837
Jorge, when he tried to run,

700
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:57,800
he proved he was willing
to turn against us, all of us.

701
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,638
Men with nothing to hide don't run, right?

Now... I trust you can take over
Córdova's responsibilities.
