Do you have an address for Jurado?

163
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,435
I can get it for you.

164
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,732
So what happened
since the last time I saw you?

165
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,485
Are you going to take these men on,
or what?

166
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,157
- I'm going to do my job.
- And your bosses?

167
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,660
Do they know what you're doing?

I was thinking...

00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,026
maybe I could come with you.

176
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,615
Oh, come on, this could be our last chance
to travel like we used to.

177
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,285
- Remember that place in Milan?
- With the leaking roof?

178
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,330
On your birthday.
And that terrible risotto.

179
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,874
That balcony.

180
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,421
The brothers are pushing now, baby.
They are opening more accounts.

181
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,840
- It's dangerous.
- I don't care.

182
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,723
How high are you right now?

183
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,768
Hey, fuck you!

184
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,811
Give me your passport.

185
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,607
I can't stay in this apartment anymore,
Franklin.

186
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,902
I can't watch another movie with subtitles
by myself.

187
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,756
I don't want to listen to the cartel wives
talk about their husbands...

188
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,717
- With an English degree from Harvard...
- Please don't tell me I can teach.

189
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,326
Then what did you want me to say?

190
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,161
Fuck.

191
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,456
We'll do this another time.

192
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,004
<font color="#80FF00">[IN SPANISH]</font> The dining room is over here.

193

You have a room over here.

You have another one over here.

195
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,096
And here, you have the living room.

196
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,063
The dimmer is over here.

- No. I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?

200

Does this seem normal to you?

201
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,746
You indicated to Mr. Rodríguez

202
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,708
you were uncertain about returning
to the North Valley.

203
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,378
And that's why he bought me a palace.
With dimmers.

204
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,840
Please tell Don Miguel thank you,

205
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,926
but I need to think
about his generous offer.

206
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,430
We have that dinner tonight.

207
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,266
With your friends?

208
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,977
With the investors.

209
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,689
They're not going to like
the six-month delay.

210
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,527
And I think it's best if we don't mention
the Rodríguez brothers by name.

211
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,533
I know you're embarrassed by what I do.

212
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,751
I know you did it for your family.

213
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,046
But if these people like everything
they hear tonight,

214
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,007
you'll have your own security firm
the second these six months are up.

Today is a busy day for us, boys.

225

Bosses have meetings all day
at the National Hotel.

226
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:38,169
I need you to pre-sweep
each and every location on this schedule.

227
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:42,340
And I don't want a bunch of cars parked
like bullshit, blocking escape routes.

228
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:46,677
- He's looking at you, Montez.
- Of course I'm talking to you, you idiot.

229
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,057
Don Miguel's team on channel six.
Don Gilberto's, channel eight.

230
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,559
Jorge says that the DEA is visiting Cali.

231
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:58,648
Two agents from Bogotá. They're new.
They're working with the National Police.

232
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,485
But they don't have warrants.
They're tourists.

233
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,904
They need permission
to wipe their own asses.

234
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,868
Regardless, while they're in Cali,
we'll be watching them.

235
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,747
- That's your job, Enrique, my brother.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,374
That's all, gentlemen.

237
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,335
Communicate. Stay safe. Get to work.

238
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:26,676
I have to duck out early.
It's a work thing for Paola.

239
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,760
Of course.

240
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,096
Do you want to practice your English?

241
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,765
Starkman, the American lawyer,
arrives today.

242
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,809
Can you pick him up from the airport?

243
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,729
Aren't you worried about the tourists?

244
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,358

never as good as the first.

245

Nobody talks.

250
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,064
All the multinationals
used to have offices here in Cali.

"Used to"?

252
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,236
Pulled out because of the city's ties
to the narcotics trade.

253
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,240
The Rodríguez brothers
are the only game in town now.

254
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,786
Fucking drug dealers
pretending to be stockbrokers.

255

258
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,012
This way, Mr. Starkman.

259
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,891
How the hell are you supposed
to fly international if you can't smoke?

260
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,684
I guess you can always quit.

261
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,481
And let United Airlines
tell me how to live?

262
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,570
Remind me again... Kansas City?

263
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,782
- Leavenworth.
- What the fuck for?

264
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,493
My father was in the army.
There's a base there.

265
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:20,373
They sent him to train.
I was like... seven years old.

266
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,042
What? It's America.

267
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,502
That's for sure.

268
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,922
So am I meeting the brothers at the hotel?

269
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,005
Yes.

270
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,677
Serious stones on these guys.

271
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,347
Retiring, like they run Lehman Brothers.

272
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,100
It's a good break for you, though.

273
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,769
You'll get immunity

The contribution should be divided

293
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,960
All right, very well. Going forward,
