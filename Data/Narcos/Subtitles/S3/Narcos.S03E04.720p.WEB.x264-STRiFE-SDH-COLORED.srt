- I already told you, Gilberto is not home.

- No one, Colonel.
- No? All good?

Maybe you're scared.

202
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,987

Calm down, Mrs. Salazar. Calm down.

I'd like to speak with you, if I could.

207
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,614
Go right back to where you came from

208
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,577
and tell that whore
if she wants my grandson,

209
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,079
she can come looking for him.

210
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,789
I just came to talk.

211
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,208
If you don't like what I have to say,

212
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,412
I'll go to Cali
and deliver whatever message you want.

213
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,546
I'm unarmed. I'm here to talk.

214
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:38,760
Your boss murdered my son...
to take up with his whore wife.

215
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:43,891
And now you come to take my grandson
far from the only family he has left.

216
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,519
I know this is not what you want to hear.
But she is his mother.

217
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,314
And Miguel Rodríguez is protecting her.

218
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,566
Protecting?

219
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,819
Is that what they call it now?

220
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,780
And he will be protected as well.

221
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:03,869
And if you let me take him back, I promise
you can see him whenever you'd like.

222
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,664
You promise. How nice of you.

223

Who told you I would do that?

224
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:16,256
I have him here and I can see him
whenever I want and protect him.

Mr. Rodríguez, do you have a response

Gilberto's arrest proved

For the people who thought the surrender
was the only way to avoid violence,

375

But whatever side you fell on,
one thing was clear:

378
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,970
Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest
came as a surprise to everybody.

379
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,390

402
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:00,546
We need to assume
all your current homes are... unsafe.

403
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,633
I'll stay here for now.

404
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,014
We all need to talk.

405
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,899
What did you expect? A warrant
by definition authorizes the police...

406
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:23,861
Wait. Let's not lie to ourselves.

407
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:27,615
This operation was run
by the Drug Enforcement Administration

408
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,033
of the United States.

409
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,994
The takedown, Mr. Attorney General,
was National Police.

410
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:36,665
The transport was by our police.
The booking was by our police.

411
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,210
So a war started by National Police?

412
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,545
Look, as Attorney General,

413
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:47,134
my main... concern is achieving
a peaceful settlement with the godfathers.

414
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,762
And the arrest
of Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela

415
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:53,682
means we now have new leverage
to negotiate with.

416
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,895
The President of Colombia, Ernesto Samper.

417
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,985
I hate to be late to a good debate.

418
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,989
You know us, might as well
try to smooth rough water with a hammer.

419
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,869
I've been apprised by Minister Botero

420
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,622
about our newly-incarcerated
Cali godfather.

421
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,210
- With all due respect, Mr. President?
- Go ahead, Miguel.

422
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,132
We've worked for months
to negotiate this surrender.

423
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,428
We recommend the immediate release
of Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela.

424
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,266
Colombia is a nation of laws.

425
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,726
Not of concessions.

426
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,814
If I give a pass to the largest criminal
organization in the world...

427
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,526
the trust of the people
will be lost forever.

428
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,614
Mr. Rodríguez is entitled
to the same due process

429
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,783
as any Colombian citizen.

430
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,287
Let's see where due process gets him.

431
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,249
For now...

432
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,586
his arrest stands.

Besides, I thought you could use
a friendly face.

440
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:22,373
What I could really use
is a tumbler of whiskey about this big.

- Vulnerable.

get you in front of a judge.

447
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:53,153

due to the conspiracy charge.

448
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,115
I don't get it.

449
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,826
This is a mistake, a blunder.

450
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,538

the other three godfathers will fall.

00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,827
Tonight, we celebrate.

499
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,080
Tomorrow, we go back to work.

500
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,793
Well, not for me.

501
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,881
<font color="#80FF00">[IN SPANISH]</font> What are you talking about?

502
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,964
<font color="#80FF00">[IN ENGLISH]</font> You remember those papers
that were seized by your men in Cali?

503
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:46,970
Yeah, we never saw those.

504
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,390
Apparently, Vargas did.

505
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,853
And there was a list of cops
who've been accepting money from Cali.

506
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:59,358
<font color="#00ffff">One name he was eager to share</font>: mine.

507
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,780
Those son of a bitches
want to discredit Gilberto's arrest.

508
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:09,117
Exactly. It sends a message to any cop
who wants to try what we did.

509
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,837
<font color="#80FF00">[IN SPANISH]</font>
I turned in my weapon and my badge.

510
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,217
Good luck.

511
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,636
Colonel...

512
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,723
I'm sorry.

513
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:43,026
Men like me would give our lives
to arrest a man like him.

514
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,447
You did everything right, Peña.

515
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,201
But now you're all alone.

516
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,413
<font color="#80FF00">[IN ENGLISH]</font> Take care.

517
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,193
<font color="#80FF00">[IN SPANISH]</font>
We need to talk about your security.

518
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,905
Let me be in charge.

519
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,200
I'll protect you, Dad.

520
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,165
Now's not the time for a change.

521
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:47,090
We need to keep things on track
until your uncle is back.

522
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,555
What if he doesn't come back?

Jorge.

526
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,385
- They got Gilberto.
- <font color="#80FF00">[PACHO]</font> I don't understand.

527
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,221
I thought Gilberto
had this all under control.

528
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,764
So did I.

529
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:38,975
And what now?

530
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,977
This could get messy.

531
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:45,148
Stay where you are.
Right now, we look out for ourselves.

532
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,361
Pacho... be smart.

533
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,906
For now, we wait.

534
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,575
You stay there a while longer.

535
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,745
We have to keep everything running.

536
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:04,960
The health of the business
has never been more important. Understand?

537
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,129
Yes. Of course.

538
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,426
You listening to me, motherfucker?

00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,388

Hey, listen, buddy, I don't speak Spanish.

540
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,516
No speak Spanish.

541
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,935
Okay.

542
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,020
Have a nice day.

543
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,554
Hey, boss. Good day today, huh?

544
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:58,889
The Jurado tapes.

545
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:03,185
Well, we probably shouldn't call them that
because they're not legal, per se.

546
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,478
I want all of them.
