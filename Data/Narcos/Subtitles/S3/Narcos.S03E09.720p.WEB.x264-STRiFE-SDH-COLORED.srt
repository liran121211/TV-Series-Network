- Sir...

The fact is, Agent Peña, you've got
nothing outside of scorched earth.

34

We have to turn this over
to Colombian authorities.

36

your case files by 5:00 p.m. today.

Sir, what if Botero is the leak?

38
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,735

we've asked him to do. He's... He's...

40

He risked his life.
He's risked his family.

41
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,286

- So get him out now.

What did Salcedo say
about the new location?

52
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,995
David stepped up security. It would take
a battalion of cops to get Miguel.

53
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,039
He says our best bet's
to wait for Miguel to move.

55

get Salcedo out now.

57

you go with them. You can't wait for me.

166
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,297
I'll be fine.

167

But it concerns all of our futures.

171
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,320
I've been concerned
about my brother, Gilberto.

172
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:22,325
The thing is, he's been speaking to some
of our partners without telling me.

173
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,161
Undermining me.

174
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,705
Making it very difficult
to run this business.

175
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,917
So...

176
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,632
I decided to have
my brother's phone tapped.

177
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,178
What the fuck are you saying, Miguel?

178
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,556

180
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,102

181

00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,035
Of course you can.

186

but I will tell you one important thing.

188
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:18,256
The surrender was Gilberto's dream.
It was never ours.

189
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:23,720
Besides, we all know
how good Gilberto is at promising things

190

191
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,807

193
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,813

194
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,815

195

a new social security number,

to two labs in New York...

198
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,498
so you can rebuild what's ours.

199
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,252
And what did he promise you?

200
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,254

201
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,593

- We were wrong.
- Wrong?

520
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,864
Yes. I checked
the Samper campaign financials

521
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:24,242
and I found that in July of last year,
they had serious losses.

522
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,912
They needed money
for travel, ads, etcetera.

523
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,664
And they got $6 million.

524
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,667
Just happens to be the amount
Botero took from the cartel.

525
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,502
So...

526
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,797
- he wasn't laundering the money.
- No.

527
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,009
That money stayed in the campaign.

00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,553

Sir, there's another piece of this
that you need to know.

539
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:32,769
These are bank accounts opened in Curaçao
by a guy named Medina.

540
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,937
Yeah, I know him.

541
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,898
Well, good, because he was working
with Fernando Botero.

542
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,819
They received over six million dollars
from the Cali cartel,

543
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,822
which went into
the Samper presidential campaign.

544
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,406
And you know this how?

545
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,033
I did some digging.

546
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:52,247
Ambassador, I am certain
that the Minister of Defense is corrupt

547
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,581
and that it doesn't stop there.

548
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:57,054
You ask the president, he's gonna say
he didn't have a fucking clue,

549
00:38:57,085 --> 00:39:00,004
but that money won him the election.

550

<i>Then you have our support.</i>
