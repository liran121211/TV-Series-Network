00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,273
[announcer]<i> Thank you for being here</i>
<i>with us, with the groom and the bride.</i>

2
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>Come and dance with us, everyone.
Let's begin.</i>

3
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,781
<i>As they say, here we have
the most beautiful women in Laredo.</i>

4
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,033
- Congratulations, Danny.
- Thank you for coming.

5
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,951
Congratulations.

00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,580
[announcer speaking Spanish]

8
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,055
The last time I saw Danny, he was riding
a big wheel down the sidewalk.

9
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,641
It means a lot to your<i> tía</i>
that you're here.

10
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,327
- Don Chucho.
- [in Spanish] Luis, how are you?

11
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,477
How are you, sir?

12
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,396
- Javi.
- [in English] Hey, Luis.

13
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,440
We heard about what you did in Colombia.
We sure are proud of you.

14
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,110
- Thanks, Luis. Have a good night.
- You, too.

15
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,193
<i>Hola,</i>Paco.

16
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,411
[in Spanish]
Everyone in Laredo is at this thing.

17
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,577
Hey!

18
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,169
- [in English] Be right back, Pops.
- Mm-hmm.

19
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,257
- Here you go, sweetheart. You got that?
- [boy] Yummy!

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,340
Hey, Lorraine.

21
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,930
Javi. Heard you were back.

22
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,182
I mean, the whole town's talking about it.

23
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,310
I had some time off.

24
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,145
Decided to spend it here?

25
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,109
Actually, I'm...

26
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,903
trying to quit.

27
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,239
Doing the Nicorette thing.

28
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,908
Look at you. A whole new man.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,293
Listen, Lorraine...

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,840
I just wanted to say
I've thought about things...

31
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,760
and I'm real sorry about all of it.

32
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,803
You waited ten years
to tell me you're sorry?

33
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,847
I know what I did.

34
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,392
I was, um...

35
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,356
It was wrong.

36
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,777
I forgave you a long time ago, Javi.

37
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,071
The truth is, I'm grateful.

38
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,032
I ended up where I'm supposed to be.

39
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Maybe we both did.

40
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,579
If you hadn't come into my life
and disappeared from it,

41
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,289
none of that would have ever happened.

42
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,709
Can you imagine
if we were actually married?

43
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,298
- Here you go, baby.
- Thank you.

44
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,634
- Hey, Jav.
- Randy.

45
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,678
- How are you?
- Good.

46
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,305
Yeah, I just... I just wanted to say hi.

47
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,390
Yeah.

48
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,351
You hungry?

49
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,646
[Lorraine] Oh, you are getting so big.

50
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,620
I know you didn't like it tonight,
all the attention, but...

51
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,873
folks want to pay their respects.

52
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,583
You're a hero to them.

53
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,295
I'm not a hero.

54
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,530
[in Spanish] Will you tell me something?

55
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,119
What happened to you over there?

56
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,539
- Dad, I don't know. It got ugly.
- But you want to go back?

57
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,719
[in English]
When you were a kid, a little guy,

58
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,638
all you wanted to do was get out of here,

59
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,515
out into the world.

60
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,560
But you didn't like what you found.

61
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,520
A lot of people don't.

62
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,064
But don't try to change it.

63
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,402
More likely, it'll change you.

64
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,655
It was right here, wasn't it?

65
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,910
The last time we had this conversation.

66
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,454
You didn't listen to me then, either.

67
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,455
Nope.

68
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,834
[grunts]

69
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,214
So, Cali.

70
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,343
Cali.

71
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:07,390
[theme music playing]

72
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,943
[in Spanish] Sir, here you are.

73
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,778
Thank you.

74
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,122
[Peña]<i> I'm not a hero.</i>

75
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,042
<i>There were some in the hunt for Escobar.</i>

76
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,336
<i>A lot, actually.</i>

77
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,840
<i>But it's tough to see them
through all the blood.</i>

78
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,259
<i>To kill a monster, sometimes you have
to get in bed with other monsters.</i>

79
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,387
<i>If that surprises you,
pick up a history book.</i>

80
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,055
<i>It's what we do.</i>

81
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,478
<i>The enemy of my enemy is my friend,
until he becomes my enemy again.</i>

82
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,397
<i>When that happens, God help them.</i>

83
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,527
<i>The day Pablo went down, the Cali cartel
became Public Enemy Number One.</i>

84
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,323
<i>And the fact that they helped us
bring him down didn't mean shit.</i>

85
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,577
Many observers fear Colombia's
other large cartel, the Cali cartel,

86
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,913
will now simply step up
its own drug production.

87
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,831
[Peña] <i>And that's exactly what happened.</i>

88
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,434
<i>While the world was focused on Escobar,</i>

89
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,170
<i>Cali's operations had grown exponentially,</i>

90
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,589
<i>differing from their rival
in every possible way.</i>

91
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,010
<i>Where Pablo sought the love and protection
of the masses of Medellín,</i>

92
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,346
<i>these guys rubbed shoulders
with Colombia's elite</i>

93
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,099
<i>and called themselves
"the Gentlemen of Cali."</i>

94
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,645
<i>And whereas Escobar craved the spotlight,
these guys stayed in the shadows,</i>

95
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,188
<i>perfecting the game,</i>

96
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,943
<i>building complex smuggling
and distribution networks through Mexico,</i>

97
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:09,990
<i>Europe, and the Far East,
without leaving so much as a fingerprint.</i>

98
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,368
<i>Even the people working for them didn't
know it was Cali coke they were moving.</i>

99
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,912
<i>It was fucking Cocaine, Incorporated.</i>

100
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,498
<i>And they ran it
like a Fortune 500 company.</i>

101
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,376
<i>So, without further ado,</i>

102
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,421
<i>meet the management team
of the Cali cartel:</i>

103
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,718
<i>Pacho Herrera,
head of distribution and security.</i>

104
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,635
Hello.

105
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,055
<i>He led a team of young psychopaths
who would do anything he asked.</i>

106
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,224
[in Spanish] Yes. What's up?

107
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,935
<i>Chepe Santacruz-Londoño.</i>

108
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,020
[in Spanish] Let's see.

109
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,773
<i>Grew up with the Rodríguez brothers.</i>

110
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,653
<i>He was in charge of U.S. operations</i>

111
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:53,324
<i>and responsible for Cali's
crown jewel: New York City.</i>

112
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,912
<i>He actually lived there,
under an assumed name, of course.</i>

113
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,417
<i>Cartel's number two was
operations chief: Miguel Rodríguez.</i>

114
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,335
[in Spanish]
Palmira's police superintendent.

115
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,646
Didn't we just take care of him?

116
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,673
- I'm talking about the new one, Arango.
- How much?

117
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,383
- Should I put $20,000?
- No.

118
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,886
Put 17.

119
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,305
- Seventeen?
- Yes.

120
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,016
[Peña] <i>Miguel watched over</i>
<i>all the money coming in,</i>

121
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,060
<i>and what bribes they were paying out.</i>

122
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:26,941
<i>And last but not least, cartel CEO,
the man with the plan: Gilberto Rodríguez.</i>

123
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,445
<i>They called him the Chess Player,
because he was always one move ahead.</i>

124
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:36,284
<i>They were the pinnacle of trafficking
evolution. Apex drug dealers.</i>

125
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,745
<i>And being number two
allowed them to quietly grow</i>

126
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,414
<i>into the biggest cocaine cartel
in history.</i>

127
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>Except now, that was over.</i>

128
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,628
<i>Now that the guy
that occupied our attention was gone,</i>

129
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,838
<i>they were number one
with a fucking bullet.</i>

130
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,593
<i>And there was no chess move
that would get them out of it.</i>

131
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,054
<i>But I was looking forward
to seeing them try.</i>

132
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,724
[in Spanish]
Anderson! Move all that over to the left.

133
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,935
The tables are too close together.

134
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,401
Are you planning on saying
anything tonight?

135
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,987
No.

136
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,865
I'll speak for the both of us.

137
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,451
- Did you talk to the North Valley people?
- Yes.

138
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:21,955
And?

139
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,582
They said what they thought
I wanted to hear.

140
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,002
But tonight, after the announcement,
we'll know the truth.

141
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,546
[taps glass on table]

142
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,630
[scoffs]

143
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,675
You're more superstitious than Aunt Luz.

144
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,682
[beeps]

145
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,535
Hey, boss.

146
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,954
Is everything ready?

147
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,413
Yes, sir.

148
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,001
It took all night, but... it's ready, sir.

149
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,628
You can handle it, you're young.

150
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,636
We're meeting Córdova.

151
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,930
He wants to go over the game plan.

152
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,099
Big night tonight, right?

153
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,060
Lots of company.

154
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,662
[Córdova] Gentlemen.
Let's start with the obvious.

155
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,332
Tonight is fucking important.

156
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,918
The Rodríguez brothers never...

157
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,629
gather members of their organization
in one place.

158
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,841
That simply never happens.
But tonight, they're going to do it.

159
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,928
So we have to be sharp.

160
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,681
- Eyes in the back of the head, understood?
- Yes, sir.

161
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,726
- Jorge.
- Stay focused.

162
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,187
Stay on the radio. Communicate.

163
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,564
Tonight is his last operation.

164
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,611
He's leaving us
to become a fancy businessman.

165
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,529
Let's leave a good impression.

166
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,491
Maybe he'll hire us one day.

167
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,159
[laughter]

168
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,243
Let's go.

169
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,128
What do you think Gilberto
is going to announce tonight?

170
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,257
I think it's a move into the Asian market.

171
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,425
I have no idea.

172
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,178
After Friday, it's not my problem.

173
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,805
Are you really leaving?

174
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,057
I promised Paola.

175
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,437
I promise things to my wife
every day, brother.

176
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,772
[chuckles]

177
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,233
Relax, you'll find someone else
to make you look good.

178
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,027
I hope so, buddy.

179
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,947
Because right now,
I'm surrounded by a bunch of assholes.

180
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,210
[Stoddard in English]
Congratulations on the promotion, sir.

181
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,670
Tell me what you do again.

182
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,589
I'm the deputy country attaché.
I'll also be your driver.

183
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,758
I drive myself.

184
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,139
You know, you're kind of a big deal
around here. Since Escobar.

185
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,725
- Katie.
- Good morning.

186
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,312
Sir, can I ask?

187
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,398
What was Escobar like?

188
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,400
Never met him.

189
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,947
[Peña]<i> Just because we'd been focused</i>
<i>on Escobar the past few years</i>

190
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,825
<i>didn't mean we were completely ignoring
the Cali godfathers.</i>

191
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,162
I want updates from Duffy and Lopez
on where we're at with Cornerstone.

192
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,246
- ASAP.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,967
Those are our intelligence summaries
on the Cali cartel.

194
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,636
I don't want summaries.
Where's everything else?

195
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,139
[Peña]
<i>We had agents on them the whole time.</i>

196
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,849
<i>Good agents.</i>

197
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,770
<i>And recently, we had gotten lucky.</i>

198
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,940
You got some kind of medical condition?

199
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,319
Oh. No, I got one.

200
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,404
[Peña]
<i>The latest break in the case against Cali</i>

201
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,908
<i>came from a joint Customs-DEA operation
called Cornerstone.</i>

202
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,663
<i>And it put a lot of mid-level Cali guys
behind bars in the States.</i>

203
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,126
<i>And while they weren't eager to help us,</i>

204
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,046
<i>you could always count
on some poor relative in Colombia...</i>

<i>And if that sounds harsh,
that's because it is.</i>

209
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,182
This is Andres, his brother.

<i>The DEA doesn't fuck around.</i>

211
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,560
And how can I help him?

[cumbia music playing]

213
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,116
Here we go.

214
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,371
[in Spanish] Hey, brother. Have a seat.

215
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,875
Something to drink?

216
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,948
[in English] You're fine, brother.
Nobody out here knows us.

217
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,134
Cali cops don't even know we're here.

218
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,428
[in Spanish] Relax. You're safe here.

220
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,682
[in Spanish]
Let's talk about tonight's party.

221
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,351
We need info on the people attending.

222
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,520
Cops, politicians.

223
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,397
- Cops and politicians?
- Yes.

224
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,568
Who work for the cartel.
These people are ruining your country.

225
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,335
[Duffy in English] And the why. Tell him.

226
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:52,076
[in Spanish] Look, the thing is, these
people never get together in one place.

227
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,204
We need to know why now.

228
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,582
Our guess is Gilberto Rodríguez

229
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,460
is making some kind
of important announcement.

230
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,085
Understand?

231
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,380
[in English] If no...

232
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,549
bye-bye,<i> hermano.</i>

00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,393
- How are things in Texas, Agent Peña?
- Hot.

234
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,315
How's the family? You know,
you had a few more weeks off coming.

235
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,168
Could've spent more time at home.

236
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,527
Yeah, well, I guess they couldn't wait
to get rid of me.

237
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:33,493
Sir, this operation in Miami, Cornerstone,
shook some leads loose.

238
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,119
Could be a break on Cali.

239
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,749
- Anyone testifying?
- No, but it put an asset in play.

240
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,515
Could shed some light on their next move.

241
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,594
Things won't be like Escobar, Agent Peña.

242
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,014
It can't be.
Things have changed down here.

Gaviria put up with things
that this guy might not.

00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,606
Just take it a little slowly.

Get your feet under you,
get used to the new job.

I'm hoping it won't be an issue
moving forward.

00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,705
I know you and Stechner
have your differences.

251
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,416
- It won't be a problem.
- I'm not sure I share your confidence.

252
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,585
Stechner signed off on your appointment.

253
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,338
In fact, he wanted you back.

254
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,926
The CIA and the DEA
need to work together on this one.

255
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,511
We have the same goal.

Everything okay?

261
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,169
Yes, but...
I thought someone was tailing me.

262
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,214
- He thinks he may have been followed.
- No, yeah, I figured.

263
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,383
I had to make sure I was alone.

Let's get you suited up.
Run through the plan again.

Ready.

268

should fix things with Pacho, Claudito?

271
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,704
He's a boss.

272
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,666
We're in their territory, right?

273
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,755
Yes. Yes.

274
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,548
I'll fix it tonight.

For our children,
and our children's children.

278
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,687
That sounded great, brother.

279
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,940
Let me do it from the top.

280
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,277
No one gives a shit about your speech.
We can hear it after...

281
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,030
- Pacho!
- Chepe!

282
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,199
Come here, you crazy motherfucker.

283
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,994
What's up?

284
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,789
Look at you. How's New York?

285
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:11,168
Cold. But if you ask nicely,
the girls make up for it.

286
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,921
I brought you something, baby-face.

287
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,801
Lovely. Thanks.

288
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,682
It's been too long
since we were all together.

- Cheers!

00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,320
I think there is business
to discuss first, Gilberto.

292
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,116
You're acting like someone
just pissed you off.

293
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,661
Brother, you're richer than the Pope.

294
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,538
But I work harder than him.

295
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,622
Cheers, then!

296
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,206

Claudio Salazar from North Valley.

302

And he's downstairs.

I would like to solve it.

304
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,108
[Gilberto] Okay, Pacho.

305
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:21,739
I understand your need for revenge,
but this isn't the time to get into it.

306
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,741
There's too much at stake.

307
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:29,830
Well... shall we enjoy
this expensive party or what?

308
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:33,793
No. Instead, let's listen
to Gilberto's speech again.

I pay all these people.

Well done, big shot.

316
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,287
It's not your money.

317
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,206
But I'm the one who controls it.

318
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,792
- Who bought you these earrings?
- Guillermo. Enough.

319
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,961
Sure. You're turning into Al Capone.

Shit. Get out of here.

00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,323
if you're getting anything
in this shitty light.

349
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,409
Who are you?

350
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,661
I'm in charge of security
for the Rodríguez brothers.

351
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,163
See that man over there?

352
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,457
His name is Navegante.

353
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,668
Guess what he does?

354
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,631
Either you come with me,
or you go with him.

355
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,215
You understand?

356
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,177
Follow me.

357
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,405
Your name is Andrés Restrepo.

358
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,032
You live with your mother
in commune number 3.

359
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,619
You have a girlfriend in Libertadores.

360
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,873
Your brother is Lucho.

361
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:44,293
He's in federal custody
in the United States.

362
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,254
That's why you agreed to work for the DEA.

363
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,964
Don't lie to me.

364
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,009
Andrés, you made a bad decision.

365
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,512
But I think you're smart enough
to realize that.

366
00:25:56,305 --> 00:26:00,058
You have another decision to make,
and it's the only way to get out alive.

367
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,269
Leave Cali.

368
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,065
Don't say goodbye to your mother
or to your girlfriend.

369
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,859
I need you to disappear.

370
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,865
Associates.

371
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,992
Friends.

372
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,953
Our enemy is dead!

373
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,914
[supportive cheers]

374
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,625
Our business is strong!

375
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,878
Together we have taken this business

376
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,507
to heights that our predecessors
couldn't have imagined.

377
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:38,263
But friends... there's circumstances
that we need to acknowledge.

378
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,021
Stoddard!

379
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,606
[Gilberto]<i> Listen to me.</i>

380
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:54,780
<i>The law enforcement spotlight will shine
brightly on us, as it once did on Escobar.</i>

381
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,742
<i>And so, while we celebrate,</i>

382
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:03,956
<i>they will do everything they can
to take away everything we've built.</i>

383
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,253
<i>An American named Joseph Kennedy</i>

384
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,172
made his fortune
selling bootlegged liquor,

385
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,008
but he turned that money into legitimacy.

386
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,261
His children, great politicians.

387
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,931
And one of them
was even elected president.

388
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:26,436
Yes, gentlemen, we have been negotiating
with the authorities,

389
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,272
and soon we will reach an agreement.

390
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,565
[low murmurs]

391
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:39,491
Our organization, within six months,
will be out of the cocaine business.

392
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,745
We will surrender our labs,

393
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,123
our safe houses,

394
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,750
and our trafficking routes.

395
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:55,173
But gentlemen, don't make the mistake
of thinking it won't be on our terms.

396
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,677
Any prison sentences will be minimal.

397
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,305
Our money will remain ours.

398
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,808
Our legitimate businesses
will continue to grow.

399
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,479
We have six months to make
as much money as possible!

400
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,191
And gentlemen,
as a token of our friendship,

401
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:18,572
we'll give each of you a juicy share

402
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,658
of the final profits from this year.

403
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,620
[scattered supportive cheers]

404
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:31,960
To the bright future we'll all soon enjoy.

405
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:36,048
For our children...
and our children's children!

406
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,552
- Cheers...
- Cheers!

407
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,180
- Cheers, gentlemen!
- Cheers!

408
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,642
- What did you think?
- I think it's a great move.

409
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,188
- Congratulations!
- For the future!

410
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,194
Thank you, brother. Thank you for coming.

411
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,981
[bartender in Spanish]
What would you like?

412
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,298
Whiskey. Dry.

413
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,721
[in English] Hey, sir!

414
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,017
We were wondering
if we could get you a drink.

415
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,186
I'm good. Thanks.

416
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,065
Okay.

417
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:40,445
[in Spanish] Six months.

418
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,240
I'm going to bleed New York dry.

419
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,744
Come up behind the Statue of Liberty
and fuck her right up her ass.

420
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,247
[chuckles]

421
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,127
And then what?

422
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:00,173
We only have six months
of doing whatever the fuck we want?

423
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,099
Hello.

424
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,148
I love you, brother.

425
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,236
I'll see you on the dance floor.

426
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,792
[indistinct chatter]

427
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,800
- Can you get in the car, please?
- Why do you want to leave so early?

428
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,260
Because it's time, okay?

429
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,144
- Why are you treating me like this?
- Enough!

430
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,264
Get in the car.

431
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,981
[car door opens and closes]

432
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,108
[engine revs]

433
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,785
[chatter over radio]

434
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,749
[knock on door]

435
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,526
How was everything tonight, Jorge?

436
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,211
Very good, sir.

437
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,384
Do you think we surprised them?

438
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,262
Yes. I think you surprised many people.

439
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,727
I'm told we had an uninvited guest.
What happened there?

440
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,149
Don't be modest.

441
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,360
Córdova told me.

442
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,071
It's your talent.

443
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,741
Spotting the threat,
knowing when they're going to fuck us.

444
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,911
It's priceless.

445
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,747
[chuckles]

446
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,543
I'm told you want to leave.

447
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:06,633
I'm grateful to you
and your family, but...

448
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:11,346
I'm starting my own security firm.

449
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:17,352
I only wanted to stay until...
Escobar stopped being a threat.

450
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,940
And we are very grateful. Honestly.

451
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,527
You have done great things for us
over the years.

452
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,488
For my family. For me.

453
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,452
I cannot accept your resignation, Jorge.

454
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:47,924
With all due respect,
I've already made arrangements...

455
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,509
Arrangements can change.

456
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:55,390
Look, we didn't get where we are
by allowing good people to leave.

457
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,228
We will need you more than ever
in the months ahead.

458
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,815
It's only six months.

459
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,403
Can I count on you, Jorge?

460
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:11,906
Yes?

461
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,204
Of course, boss.

462
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,413
Miguel.

463
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,811
[in English] Pretty girl.

464
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,399
Displays some shaky judgment
in men, though.

465
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,988
Welcome back, Agent Peña.

466
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,407
<i>Mazel tov</i> on the promotion.

467
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:59,246
That extra, what, 9K a year
is really gonna come in handy.

468
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,372
[in Spanish] The same.

469
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:02,791
[in English] So?

470
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,918
You signed off on me
coming back to Bogotá.

471
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,001
Did indeed.

472
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,214
Because you know how things work.

473
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,258
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

474
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:17,472
To the folks back in D.C.,
Escobar was a win.

475
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,640
[in Spanish] Thanks.

476
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,478
[in English] But down here...
we know what it cost, don't we?

477
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,897
Medellín was a failure.

478
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,357
Thousands of Colombians dead,

479
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,277
and coke still flooding
American streets by the ton.

480
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,114
Oh, come on. You don't care about
American streets or dead Colombians.

481
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,205
What was accomplished, Agent Peña?

482
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,043
We do Cali differently.

483
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,547
No swallowing the spider
to catch the fly this time.

484
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,383
America's got plans for Colombia.

485
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,845
Another bloodbath complicates them.

486
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,267
So...

487
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,395
what's the play?

488
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,147
Surrender.

489
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,358
Cali cartel throws in the towel.

490
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,737
Hands over the keys to the biggest
criminal enterprise in history.

491
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,603
As far as I'm concerned,
the DEA can even take the credit.

492
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,326
And these fucking guys walk?

493
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,454
Negotiations are on the two-yard line,

494
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,624
but it has backing from Washington.

495
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,421
So, what the fuck do you need me for?

496
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,549
Well, you're the dashing DEA agent
that took down Escobar.

497
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,969
Always helps to have a hero on board.

498
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,765
Don't worry. Cali will serve some time.

499
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,392
Technically speaking.

500
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,479
And that's enough for you?

501
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:53,860
If there were any justice in this world,
Javier, you'd be in jail.

502
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,786
I know your guys are running an operation
on Cali tonight.

503
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,870
Please.

504
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:11,002
I can tell you this:
it'll come up double zeros.

505
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,465
These guys don't make mistakes.

506
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,594
You try to go after the Cali bosses,
all you'll get are more bodies.

507
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:43,910
I don't know, man.

508
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,788
I met him at an embassy thing
about a year ago.

509
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,706
Yeah?

510
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,874
Couldn't drink it or fuck it,
dude wasn't interested.

511
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,543
[chuckles]

512
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,547
I hear you. I mean, he's not a bad guy.

513
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,467
He was in my class at the Academy.

514
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,097
[buzzer]

515
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,644
Kid's been gone eight hours.
He better have something good.

516
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,355
[buzzer]

517
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,322
[buzzer]

518
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,116
Fucking retard.

519
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,120
[buzzing continues]

520
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:33,918
Something's up.

521
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:42,612
Maybe he got made. Or just spooked.

522
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,989
[Duffy] Either way, we stay here tonight.

523
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,950
- Head out when it's light.
- Yeah.

524
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,669
