You're head of security for the cartel.

that we're all gonna end up dead?

Exactly! Thank you, lady.
Fucking Dominicans!

162
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:52,271
<i>But Manuel de Dios, editor of</i> La Prensa,
<i>has discovered another side to the story.</i>

163
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,899
<i>This lab,
along with a number of others in the area,</i>

164
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,653

by Colombian gangsters,</i>

165
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,323
<i>led by a man
going by the name Victor Crespo.</i>

166
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,950
- Motherfucker.
<i>- In the next few days,</i>

167
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,994
<i>we will be publishing
an investigative series</i>

168
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,122
<i>about this criminal enterprise,
including pictures.</i>

169
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,249
<i>This operation is much larger
than it seems.</i>

170
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,001
"No speak Spanish" my ass.

171
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,587
So that means we have to leave,
right, Chepe?

172
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,840
No, my love.

173
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,217
This man, he knows who you are, Chepe.

174
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,594
Don't worry. We're not going anywhere.

175
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,678
Is that so?

176
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,850
So do me a favor and fix this.

177
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,561
Did you hear me?

178
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,070
Motherfucker.

179
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,741
<font color="#80FF00">[MIGUEL]</font> So a new surrender deal.

180
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,993
<font color="#80FF00">[NICOLÁS]</font> Three years in jail. All of you.

181

Turn in the illicit businesses,

182
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,166

He would've told you himself,

184
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,712
but he thought it was best for me
to explain in person.

185
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,548
Besides, I helped negotiate the deal.

186
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,884
I understand.
Thank you for coming, Nicolás.

187
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,180
Give me an update, Uncle Miguel.

188
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,140
An update?

189
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,352
On our efforts to maximize business
before surrender.

190
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,981
So I can inform my father.

191
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,317
Tell your dad everything's
still on track here.

192
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,571
Pacho's settled new terms with Amado
Carrillo Fuentes and is coming back soon.

193
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,116
And this accident in New York?

194
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,748
Chepe encountered an obstacle,
but you know Chepe.

195
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,458
I'm not worried.

196
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,378
Are we done?

197
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,047
One last thing.

198
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,260
Our friends in Bogotá
are concerned about their exposure.

199
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,930
Too many people know about the deal.

200
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,474
They worry about Mr. Pallomari.

201
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,769
My father would like you to handle it.

202
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,897
"Handle it"?

203
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,274
Do you know what you're talking about?

204
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,318
Do you have any idea?

205
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,403
Hmm?

206
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:11,577
Pallomari's our chief accountant in Cali,
and not easily replaced.

207
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,996
He's too valuable to just kill.

208
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,240
Tell your father I'll take care of it.
He doesn't have to worry about Pallomari.

209
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,253
Thank you, Uncle Miguel.

210
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,715
Take care.

211
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,480
So now the little prince
is giving you orders?

212
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,732
His father's orders.

213
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,613
Have Salcedo put Pallomari
in one of the safe houses.

214
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,782
Keep an eye on him.

215
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,496
You decide if you're coming tonight?

216
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,250
Our Salsa Festival party, Dad.

217
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,669
It's important.

218
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:06,174
You know how I feel about parties.
That's Gilberto's thing, not mine.

219
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,510
Which is exactly why you should go.

220
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,264
Dad, you're the new boss here.

221
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,475
Please, show them.

222
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:22,231
Or at least have a good time
before we have to roll over and play dead.

I need to speak to Miguel.

Talk to whoever you want. This is
the biggest apartment we have right now.

Yeah. Got it. Thanks, Stoddard.

All right, last hit
Duffy and López had on Salcedo,

256
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,318
he was deputy chief of security
for the cartel.

257
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,236
All right. So that much is true.

258
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,654
Had a degree in engineering.

259
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:37,158
Business license for a bio-diesel factory
that went belly-up.

260

- Ex-military.

Served under a Carlo Córdova. Major.

Who became head of security
for the cartel.

00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,291
Must have been how he got the job.

264
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,752
Wonder if he clipped his old buddy
to take his spot.

265
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,630
And he was connected to the purchase
of bombs in a plan to kill Pablo.

- to protect Miguel's family to you?
- Okay.

269
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,723
So he's a scumbag. Last I checked,
he's our best bet to get Miguel.

658
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,743
- We got one of the shooters.
- They shot Álvaro, too.

659
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:15,995
Pacho is okay.

660
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,413
They're on their way back.

661
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:19,831
Are you okay?

662
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,460
- Close the damn door.
- What a fucking night.

663
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,963
Darío, please take her upstairs.

664
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,672
I'm coming soon.

665
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,558
What happened there?

666
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:39,727
It looked like...

667
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,606
you knew something was coming.

668
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:48,027
Jorge! You know what? I know why.

669
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,240
Because you are always working.

670
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,243
You saved my life tonight, Jorge!

671
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,080
- Dad, it wasn't my fault, I...
- One moment.

672
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:05,294
From now on, I want you back in charge
of my personal security.

673
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,712
Only you, Jorge.

674
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,757
Of course, Don Miguel.

675
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:14,678
And if you allow me, we don't know
if this will be the only attack or not.

676
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,514
So I need to know
where you are at all times.

677
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,433
Tomorrow is another day.

- Look, Gilberto. They tried to kill me.

687

They tried to kill my son.

688
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,517
They tried to kill María.
They tried to kill Pacho.

689
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,644
Yes, I understand, brother, but...

690
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,607
for now, we can't afford to start a war.

691
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,693
Especially being so close
to the surrender.

692
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,903
What fucking surrender, Gilberto?

693
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:16,115
Before we can surrender,
they'll take everything from us.

694
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:20,786
- Brother, listen to me.
- Okay, no war. I understand.

You're still not telling us

710

They killed the guy I replaced.

And they killed his wife.

712

And they're gonna do the same thing
to me and my family.

713

And you two are the only ones that can
help me get them out. You understand?

Yeah.
