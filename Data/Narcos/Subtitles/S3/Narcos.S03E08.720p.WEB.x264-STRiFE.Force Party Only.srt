2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,793
Please...

3
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,551
Please...

4
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,803
- Careful.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,145
Were you shot?

6
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,312
No.

7
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,315
Get him out.

8
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,444
- You're scaring him.
- Out!

9
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,035
What happened last night...

10
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,537
someone pays.

11
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,750
We took care of Calderón,

12
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,086
but those fucking gringos
still knock on my door!

13
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,840
Where the fuck were the guards?

14
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,010
Where the fuck were our men?

15
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,599
How the fuck did they know where you were,
Dad? How the fuck...?

16
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,896
We have a rat.

17
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,064
An informant.

18
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,193
They found my ledger.

19
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,655
Hey, what about Enrique?

20
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,494
He was manning the checkpoint
when the cops came in.

21
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's get inside.
Going once, going twice...

22
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:40,298
No. You can't go out that way.
Please, no, sweetie.

23
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,012
Honey, let's go inside. Inside.

24
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,738
No one's seen you since the raid.
Where the fuck are you?

25
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,414
I'm having some trouble
with my wife lately...

26
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,333
but I'm monitoring my radio.

27
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,878
- Have you talked to Enrique?
<i>- Why?</i>

28
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,551
We've been trying to reach him.
My father wants to talk to him.

29
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,637
Your dad wants to talk to Enrique?

30
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,599
Do you have any problem with that?

31
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,935
I'll find him.

32
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,021
<i>Good. Bring him in.</i>

33
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,189
<i>And Salcedo, you come, too.</i>

34
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,526
Did you find her?

35
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,322
Sure you don't want something?

36
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,075
- The <i>picada</i> here is the shit.
- You have what I asked for or not?

37
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,331
That blonde girl...

38
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,875
is a long way from home.

39
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,853
I'm imagining the headline...

40
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:09,818
"American woman held hostage
in Colombian jungle." Fuck.

41
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,073
- Thanks for the info.
- Wait.

42
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,994
I'm going to help you rescue
the Barbie doll.

43
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:26,292
To do this job, we need to work
with some old friends of ours.

44
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,171
They can help us.

45
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,718
They know the terrain like the back
of their hand. How to get in and out.

46
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,858
What's it going to cost?

47
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,026
Cheap.

48
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,905
You just have to make me a promise, Peña.

49
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,451
When my name pops up
on the DEA to-do list...

50
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,746
you pick up the phone and call me.

51
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,876
So I can be cautious and protect myself.

52
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,170
I see now.

53
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,182
To us, Peña.

54
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,690
Boss.

55
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,442
Open the door. Quick.

56
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,073
- Boss...
- What are you doing? Get in.

57
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,703
- What happened?
- David has been calling.

58
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,748
What for? He never called before.

59
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:51,377
- I wanted to talk to you first.
- Last night was a big fuck up.

60
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,796
You're in danger.
Pack a few things and let's go.

61
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,469
Jorge, I swear. I radioed in.

62
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,764
It doesn't matter, Enrique.
The DEA passed right in front of you.

63
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,892
I should just run, bro.

64
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,269
Like Córdova?

65
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,063
What? It doesn't matter!

66
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,441
Stay, run. It's the same fucking thing!

67
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,526
No matter what I do,
I'm a fucking dead man.

68
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,695
Nobody is going to die, you hear me?

69
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,697
Nobody is going to die.

70
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,952
But right now,
let's just get you to tomorrow, Enrique.

71
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,619
Why the fuck do I have to hide here?
I didn't do anything.

72
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,454
I know you didn't do anything.

73
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,708
This is David being an idiot.

74
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:18,131
But... trust me. Have some patience.
I'll handle it.

75
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,223
Last week, when you told me
to not say anything...

76
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,811
- about the DEA and their safe house...
- Hey.

77
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,773
That has nothing to do with anything.
Why are you bringing this up?

78
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,983
Stay focused.

79
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,734
Sit down.

80
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,111
Sit down.

81
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,952
It's very important you do what I say.

82
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,079
Don't leave this room.

83
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,707
And don't call anyone.

84
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,045
Not your mother, your brother
or your girlfriend. No one. Understood?

85
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,340
Hey, look at me.

86
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,260
We'll get you through this.

87
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,971
I promise.

88
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,147
Thank you, Jorge.

89
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,941
Seriously.

90
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,451
Fercho, how's it going?

91
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,082
Don Miguel.

92
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,001
Where the fuck is Enrique, Jorge?

93
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,007
I left him messages at his house,
at the tap room,

94
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,134
but trust me, I'll find him.

95
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,096
Regardless of where he is,
you know him as well as me.

96
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,806
He's a man we can trust.

97
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,018
The thing is, Jorge, I don't know Enrique.

98
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,438
Because I didn't hire him, you did.

99
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,651
No, Córdova hired him.
But that doesn't matter.

100
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,445
I don't like to make judgments
before I know all the facts,

101
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,155
and we don't know them, David.

102
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,033
I find that funny, you know?

103
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,746
Because lately,
you're missing too many facts.

104
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,624
More specifically,
about the fucking DEA, Jorge.

105
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,671
When the DEA burst into the building,
I was six feet away from your dad.

106
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:28,094
Don Miguel, I've been investigating
and it looks like Enrique did radio in.

107
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,973
I think the DEA is using a signal
to interfere with our radios.

108
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,056
Dad...

109
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,894
Dad, please.

110
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,147
It could be.

111
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,232
It could be.

112
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,818
But you know what, Jorge?

113
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,322
That doesn't explain how the DEA
knew where I was. Do you understand?

114
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,783
Yes, sir.

115
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,956
Someone sang and I want to know
who the fuck it was.

116
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,253
Find Enrique.
Let's have him speak for himself.

117
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,922
We fucking fix this once and for all.

118
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
Hi, fellas.

119
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,948
Hello.

120
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,375
Great machine.

121
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,713
You people know how to build
a fucking assault chopper.

122
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,629
Nice look, Berna.

123
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,048
You're coming on the raid?

124
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,050
Thanks, but no.

125
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm coming to make sure all goes well
with our friends.

126
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,180
Look at me.

127
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,933
Do you think an important man like me...

128
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,729
is going to risk his life
for some gringo piece of ass?

129
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,612
You don't know how to take a joke.

130
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,422
I'll go in.

131
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,215
Sure.

132
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,011
But they go with you.

133
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:39,952
What about you, brother?
Are you trying to fuck us all or what?

134
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,203
Calm down, Gilberto.

135
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,206
<i>Franklin Jurado's in U.S. custody.</i>

136
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,961
You don't want to surrender,
and you let them get the goddamn ledger!

137
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:53,132
Since you were a kid, I had to tell you
what to do and what not to...

138
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,258
<i>Know what, Gilberto?</i>

139
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:58,763
Since you were a kid, you had a big mouth.
Why don't you just shut up?

140
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,100
He's fucking lost his mind.

141
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,103
All these acts of violence
in the North Valley

142
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,314
are straining our friends' patience.

143
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,609
Any surrender deal's hanging by a thread.

144
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,527
Uncle Miguel has to see that.

145
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,946
I told him, no violence.

146
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,492
Is this all my fault?

147
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,496
Haven't I always done
what was best for him?

148
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,713
I need to reach out to Chepe. Or Pacho.

149
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,840
But how the fuck...?

150
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,927
There's no one else I can trust with this.

151
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:39,804
Let's see...

152
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:43,808
Dad.

153
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,701
I need you to get involved
in the Jurado situation.

154
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,462
Hello.

155
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,550
Any news?

156
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,802
He has a girlfriend
on the other side of town.

157
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:24,932
Look, David, if Enrique was a rat,
he wouldn't be around anymore.

158
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,225
Thanks.

159
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,437
I think I'll wait here.

160
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,607
You know he's a mama's boy.
That fucker will be back.

161
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,944
So now what?

162
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:41,490
Now you go to Toro Negro.
Navegante's waiting for you.

163
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,576
He'll give you an assignment
from my father.

164
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,996
Why didn't he call me?

165
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,125
I'm going to explain something to you.

166
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,713
Until this is figured out,
you only talk to me. Understood?

167
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,674
Yes, sir.

168
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:05,181
Better get moving.
Navegante hates to wait.

169
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,955
<i>Coming up to coordinates Kirk 5-7,
maneuver incoming.</i>

170
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,812
Gentlemen. So good to see you again.

171
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,314
Third generation night vision goggles.

172
00:21:55,397 --> 00:22:00,820
The same ones the Americans used
in Operation Desert Shield.

173
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:07,451
Peña, can we keep them afterwards
as a contribution to the cause?

174
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,434
This one has AFCS.

175
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,770
And the 701 engine.

176
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,360
- Not like last time.
- Last time?

177
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,195
The CIA.

178
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,574
They had us out here hunting commies
on Christmas day.

179
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,410
- That's real dedication.
- It is God's work.

180
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,037
Merry Christmas.

181
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,641
<i>My dad trusts him, but... did you see him?</i>

182
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,019
<i>That son of a bitch looks nervous, right?</i>

183
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:19,481
<i>Never stopped adjusting the mirror,
staring.</i>

184
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,234
<i>I kind of love how much
this motherfucker hates me.</i>

185
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,156
<i>Our man in Bogotá confirmed
there must be an informant.</i>

186
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,577
<i>Salcedo has to be the one
the gringos are calling "Natalia."</i>

187
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,413
<i>I'm going to love killing
that motherfucker.</i>

188
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,042
<i>You know who else I am going to kill?
His arrogant wife.</i>

189
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,878
<i>I'm going to leave
those poor girls orphans.</i>

190
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,421
<i>Poor things.</i>

191
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,714
<i>You can adopt them.</i>

192
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,300
<i>You son of a bitch...</i>

193
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,398
Answer.

194
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,446
<i>This is Paola, leave a message.</i>

195
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,073
Hello, love, it's me.

196
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,409
Paola, listen, I need you to call me back.

197
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,078
It's very important.

198
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,061
3 NEW MESSAGES

199
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,063
DELETE?

200
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,940
CONFIRM

201
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,400
0 NEW MESSAGES

202
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,162
Take me to where you stashed him,
Jorge Salcedo.

203
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,583
Stashed who?

204
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,008
Are we taking him someplace?

205
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,429
I see.

206
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,109
What do you mean,
you're going to a meeting?

207
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,654
I have a business to run, Guillermo.

208
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,864
A meeting with who?

209
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,701
With Fredy. We're meeting a new client.

210
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:22,122
Fredy? Patricia,
the police almost caught Miguel yesterday.

211
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,208
For fuck's sake.

212
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,502
What's the problem?

213
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,004
You didn't tell them where he was,
did you?

214
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,423
- No.
- No. What are you worried about?

215
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,510
Miguel likes you.
That's what you always tell me.

216
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,553
Yes, but always within limits.

217
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,223
You're worrying too much, Guillermo.

218
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,935
They need you. You're the brains
behind the organization...

219
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:48,732
None of that matters, Patricia, none,
if they decide not to leave loose ends.

220
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,568
You're giving me a headache.

221
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,197
Listen to me.

222
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,827
My love, we have to get out of here
before it's too late.

223
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,216
It's just a couple hours.

224
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,680
Call me if there's a problem.

225
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,994
What is it, Jorge Salcedo?

226
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,250
What do we do if we find
Pallomari's family in the apartment?

227
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,837
Hope that we don't.

228
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,344
We'll need to be quick.
I have someplace to be.

229
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:07,561
The love of my life is in town
and we have a date.

230
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,732
That's great.

231
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,359
When was the last time you saw her?

232
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,278
Eight years.

233
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,823
Eight long years.

234
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,702
Why so long since last time you saw her?

235
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,581
You know, she was abroad.

236
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,751
- In Japan.
- Japan?

237
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,170
Working?

238
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,883
She fucked a police captain.

239
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,344
Then tried to turn me in.

240
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:44,640
All these years, I've been hanging around
her parents' house

241
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,475
waiting for her to come back.

242
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:52,564
People say things happen for a reason.
All I know is... she came back.

243
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,274
She came back.

244
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,949
Beautiful day. Right?

245
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,954
How many tents, give or take?

246
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,706
I think around 20.

247
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,169
The FARC arrange themselves
in staggered positions, two circles.

248
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:19,216
Then they always go for lookouts
in high places along the trails.

249
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,759
Sun sets in three hours.

250
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,429
As soon as they hear the chopper,
they're going to hide.

251
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:28,267
Generators, flashlights, fires...
everything.

252
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,769
Those rats have a lot of practice hiding.

253
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:35,357
Once the lights go, they'll use guidelines
strung into the jungle.

254
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,986
They grab hold, follow ropes to safety.

255
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:44,324
Once we find one of those ropes...

256
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,871
It's a fucking slaughter.

257
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,352
Look, I don't want a bloodbath.

258
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,855
Listen to me, Peña.

259
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,232
You want the girl...

260
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,985
there will be a body count.

261
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,903
This is a war zone.

262
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:26,825
But if you want,
we can still call this thing off.

263
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:31,955
I need to get her back.

264
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,835
Just to be clear...

265
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,714
something goes wrong...

266
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,843
you still keep your promise.

267
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:12,204
Hey, you talk to Pallomari,
try to keep him calm.

268
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,998
- Then I come in.
- Okay.

269
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,501
He's not here, of course.

270
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,881
No luggage.

271
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,512
Must've freaked out
when Miguel almost got caught.

272
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,434
You know, Pallomari, he's the smart one.

273
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,438
Guess that's why he's the accountant.

274
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,939
And not a thug.

275
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,111
Hey, Salcedo.

276
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,322
You'll need to find him.

277
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,992
Miguel gave this priority.
Do you understand?

278
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,075
I'll take care of it.

279
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,996
Let me know when you have him.

280
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,835
I need tonight
for the business I told you about.

281
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:44,880
Sure.

282
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,551
Good luck then.

283
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,619
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>
- Salcedo! Busy today.

284
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,702
<i>Listen...</i>

285
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,080
any chatter from Pallomari?

286
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,209
None I've heard. But we got him.

287
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:25,462
Who?

288
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,217
He called his brother, the idiot.

289
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,177
<i>David's on his way to get him.</i>

290
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,930
That's great news.

291
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,599
Miguel must be pleased.

292
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,588
<i>We have him.</i>

293
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,383
Yes?

294
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,261
<i>He showed up at the house?</i>

295
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:17,556
Meet us at 11th & 614th.

296
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,695
You ever hear anything from Judy?

297
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,572
Not since you sold her out.

298
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,325
Who would've thought it, Javier?
Both of us, bosses.

299
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,953
They give you a nice place in Bogotá?

300
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:42,538
It's good.

301
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,082
You should see my house.

302
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:49,212
I can take a shit in a different bathroom
every day of the week. My wife loves it.

303
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,131
Your wife?

304
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,968
I'm a family man.

305
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,347
Bet you still live out of a suitcase.

306
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,934
Guess catching guys like me...

307
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,938
makes it all worth it. Right?

308
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,741
Don't forget the suitcase.

309
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,201
Keep going!

310
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,371
Come on. Let's go! Assume position!

311
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,471
<i>Be advised, team: five minutes to LZ.</i>

312
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,388
Let's see how our new toys work.

313
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:09,977
Get ready.

314
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,519
Our guest of honor's arrived.

315
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,400
What's going on here?

316
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,116
Jorge, you're going to have
to explain some things.

317
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,883
Alpha in position.

318
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,010
Tell him what you told us.

319
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,808
Salcedo knew about the DEA.

320
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,062
You're going to talk to me like a man,
motherfucker.

321
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,730
Salcedo works with the DEA!

322
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,483
He knew the DEA was in Cali.

323
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,446
He knew where they were at
and he told me to watch them.

324
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,782
And he told me not to tell you.

325
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,083
<i>Charlie in position.</i>

326
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,296
Bravo in position.

327
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,717
Everyone's in position.
Rotor, force them to the north.

328
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,803
<i>Copy that. We're going to push them out.</i>

329
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,681
<i>We're circling back.
Arriving in 30 seconds.</i>

330
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,851
Is that true, Jorge?

331
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,434
Tell me.

332
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,521
Tell me.

333
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,190
Are you working with the DEA?

334
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,903
Sir... it's true I've been successful
tracking the DEA.

335
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,698
But saying I knew
where their safe house is, that's absurd.

336
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,866
That's absurd.

337
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,244
<i>Rotor ETA five seconds. We have visual.</i>

338
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:44,257
<i>FARC is on the move. They're going dark.</i>

339
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:49,762
<i>Peña, they have your girlfriend
in the southeast part of camp.</i>

340
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,562
Let's move.

341
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:00,440
They're about to kill me because of you,
motherfucker!

342
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,526
That fucking son of a bitch is lying!

343
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,654
If you're looking for an infiltrator,
it's him, not me.

344
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,034
Shut up! Know what they're gonna do
to my family if you say that?

345
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,493
You son of a bitch!

346
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,746
- Get off him!
- I'll kill you, motherfucker!

347
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,957
- Let it go, motherfucker!
- Sir, that bastard is lying!

348
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:21,002
What do you want me to say
if that's the truth, motherfucker?!

349
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,211
Cut the bullshit!

350
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,053
<i>All right, men,
let's get these fireworks started.</i>

351
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:34,057
<i>And don't be pussies. This is easy.
Get ready.</i>

352
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,351
<i>This shit is on!</i>

353
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,774
I'm tired of this, Dad.

354
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,857
Sir, no.

355
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,445
David, please. What is this?

356
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,573
- Sir, I have no idea...
- Dad...

357
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:00,959
What the fuck is that?

358
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,093
What the fuck is that?

359
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,472
Is that you, motherfucker?

360
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,808
- No.
- What the fuck is that?

361
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,401
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't know, sir. I've never seen that!

362
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,904
Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.

363
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,909
<i>Let's give those fucking guerrillas
a rain of bullets!</i>

364
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,870
<i>They're in the river! Give them lead!</i>

365
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,000
Sir... it's a SkyPager.

366
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,584
It's American high-end tech.

367
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,963
- Don Miguel, please.
- Shut up.

368
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,715
What the fuck does it say?

369
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,135
These are messages in English.
He's your rat!

370
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,638
Motherfucker, you're going to have
my family killed dragging me into this!

371
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:57,974
It's not yours?

372
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,183
It's not yours, Enrique?

373
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:02,020
Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.

374
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:05,356
I swear on my mom
I've never seen that before, Don Miguel.

375
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,941
Can they track us with this shit?

376
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,609
I think so, sir.

377
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,861
Motherfucker!

378
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,531
- No.
- Don't move.

379
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:17,994
- Please! Don Miguel, no!
- Don't move.

380
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,537
No!

381
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,125
Tell the truth, motherfucker!

382
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,377
Salcedo, you motherfucker!

383
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,504
Don Miguel!

384
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,387
Look, Jorge.

385
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,181
Your friend.

386
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,688
Stay where you are.

387
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:46,772
Put the gun down!

388
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,232
Don't move.

389
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,320
One more step and I'll...

390
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,589
The rat is dead.

391
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,265
What's wrong?

392
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,267
Start.

393
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,547
Yes, I know my signature.

394
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,926
- Hi!
- Hi, Dad!

395
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,010
Where's Mom?

396
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,265
She doesn't want to see you.

397
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,939
Have some respect. This is my mom's house.

398
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,028
What's going on?

399
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:01,908
What is it?

400
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,495
What's going on?

401
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,332
Breathe.

402
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,171
What happened?

403
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,716
What's going on? Come here.

404
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,029
That phone doesn't work.

405
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,615
Try number five.

406
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,126
You're Colombian.

407
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,378
Right?

408
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,214
I'm from Cali.

409
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,086
Yes?

410
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,714
<i>It's been taken care of.</i>
