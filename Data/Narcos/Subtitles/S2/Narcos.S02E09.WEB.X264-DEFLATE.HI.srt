[vehicle rumbling]

2
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,118
[in Spanish]
Here to the right.

3
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,382
Stop.

4
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,468
[brakes squeaking]

5
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,180
Stay here.

6
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,526
Who's there?

7
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,616
Relax, sir. We come in peace.

8
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,909
Stay right there!

9
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,412
Relax.

10
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,172
How are the cows?

11
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,483
[rain patters softly outside]

12
00:01:55,698 --> 00:02:00,036
The cops came here... a few months ago.

13
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,704
What did you tell them?

14
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,957
The truth.

15
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,504
That I haven't seen you in years.

16
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,927
You've gotten old, Pablo.

17
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,598
[sighs]

18
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,976
It happens.

19
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,520
You look younger.

20
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,023
It happens. [chuckles]

21
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:33,611
Life in the country keeps you young.

22
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,617
Be careful, it's hot.

23
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,163
What's your name?

24
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,708
Limón, sir.

25
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,670
Don't give me that shit.
What's your real name?

26
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,797
- Jhon.
- Jhon.

27
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,258
Do you know how to milk a cow, Jhon?

28
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,636
- No, sir.
- Well, you better learn.

29
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,600
All right, gentlemen.

30
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,770
I get up at 5:00 a.m.

31
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,690
Good night.

32
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,276
Good night, Dad.

33
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,865
[Latin guitar theme music plays]

34
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,915
[Steve] I read in a book somewhere
about a rich guy who goes broke.

35
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,421
When he's asked how it happened,
how he had lost everything, he answered:

36
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:02,218
"Slowly at first.
And then... all at once."

37
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,056
For Pablo Escobar,
"all at once" had finally come.

38
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,478
His empire in shambles,
his army all dead or in jail,

39
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:17,525
Escobar did the one thing
he could still do: a disappearing act.

40
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,237
One month, 14 days and seven hours...

41
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,825
with no sightings, no intercepts, nothing.

42
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,996
While we waited
for his eventual reemergence,

43
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,957
the machine built to capture him
found itself idle.

44
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,794
And that brought
a different kind of danger.

45
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,214
One that comes
with too much time to think.

46
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,595
Some started to look inward
at the path we had taken to get here...

47
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,808
asking, "How much of this blood is on me,
and how do I get clean?"

48
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,479
[in Spanish]
It is the state, not individuals,

49
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,441
that has justice in its hands
and the legitimacy to use arms.

50
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,164
[Steve]
Under mounting political pressure,

51
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,279
Gaviria finally publicly denounced
Los Pepes.

52
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,866
And Los Pepes responded
with their own press release.

53
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,494
They said their job was done.

54
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,205
They were packing up and going home.

55
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,209
But Los Pepes wasn't something
you could turn on and off.

56
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,836
Its members were looking to the future.

57
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,965
One without Escobar.
And they each had their own version of it.

58
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,552
Los Pepes had knocked Pablo
out of the narco business

59
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,598
and that had created a vacancy
for a new cocaine king of Medellín.

60
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:34,519
Or, depending on who you asked,
maybe a queen.

61
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:38,356
[in Spanish] Gilberto's no longer
our partner. I don't care what he thinks.

62
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,316
Have you seen the news?

63
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,361
They issued a statement without us.

64
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,404
Los Pepes is done.

65
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,826
That's only for show.
The Castaños are still in Medellín.

66
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,119
Hmm?

67
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,079
No one told me anything.

68
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,415
Listen to me, Berna.

69
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,794
If Escobar comes through that door,
we'll kill him ourselves.

70
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,754
We don't need anybody else.

71
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,215
Start moving this product now.

72
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,134
That's all fine, Judy.

73
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,928
But if Gilberto finds out, what then?

74
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:13,057
Did you know they're offering
$1.4 million for Los Pepes?

75
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,435
I know where they are.

76
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,690
[softly] Be careful what you say.

77
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,235
That's a dangerous thought, Judy.

78
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,988
I'm not interested in the reward.

79
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,824
I'm interested in my labs.

80
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,911
Then at least tell Gilberto yourself.

81
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,084
[man] Sir?

82
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,798
Hello.

83
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,553
And to what do I owe this lovely surprise?

84
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,723
We're at the warehouse in Manrique.

85
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,475
This place is full of product.

86
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,977
What do you want us to do?
Where do we send it?

87
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,148
Keep it. Think of it as a contribution
to your great cause

88
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,567
against the communists in the jungle.

89
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,030
I'm sure you'll find its value
can be put to good use.

90
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,448
And what do we do about Judy?

91
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,825
Do whatever you think is best.

92
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,454
Well, Gilberto, if you say so.
Thank you very much.

93
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:22,460
Fidel. Gilberto said
we can keep all of it.

94
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:28,674
What? I thought we were going home.
We don't know anything about cocaine.

95
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,761
We'll learn.

96
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,305
If they can, why not us?

97
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,600
And what about Judy? Hmm?

98
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,481
Judy feels Medellín
is only big enough for one narco.

99
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,777
We'll let the Castaños decide which one.

100
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,114
[Steve] Los Pepes may have disbanded,
but that didn't mean they were done.

101
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,869
The story of a vigilante army taking down
Escobar made for great headlines.

102
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:01,582
And while no one was named, it's not
to say it wasn't cause for concern.

103
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,210
Yes, ma'am, as far as I know.

104
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,255
No, we're, uh, crystal clear on that.

105
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,715
- [whispers] Messina.
- [silent mouthing]

106
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,552
Yeah. Uh, he just got in.

107
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,351
- Hey, boss.
- [Messina] Murphy fill you in?

108
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,434
Yeah.

109
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,897
This article's getting more traction
than we thought.

110
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,442
International news outlets keep calling,
want a statement from the ambassador.

111
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,861
- Are we giving one?
- No. Nobody is.

112
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,130
But we're watching it closely.

113
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,949
I don't need to tell you
it could look very bad for us.

114
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,409
I want to make sure we're covered.

115
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,828
Well, Los Pepes is disbanded.
It's basically over.

116
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:43,082
Look, I tend to agree. But the press may
shake a few more trees, see what falls.

117
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,292
What if someone talks?

118
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,420
The only people that are gonna
talk about Los Pepes is Los Pepes.

119
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,380
And they're not talking.

120
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,424
So we're covered.

121
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,800
We better be.

122
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,512
- Fabian.
- [in Spanish] Yes?

123
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,473
- Bring the Mercedes. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.

124
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,100
Hurry up, Berna.

125
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,230
Relax, Judy.
That meeting can't start without you.

126
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,815
Mmm-hmm.

127
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,234
How many people do we have
in the laboratories?

128
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:14,363
- Forty-five in each one.
- How many supervisors?

129
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,115
Three in each.

130
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,286
- We need twice as many shifts.
- Yes, ma'am.

131
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,914
Oscar, Luis! Get in the cars.
The boss is leaving.

132
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,041
[man] Yes, sir.

133
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,254
[men shouting]

134
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,257
[indistinct]

135
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,387
[dialogue distant, muted]

136
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,599
[audio distorted]

137
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,731
[phone ringing]

138
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,364
- Peña.
- [Berna] Javier.

139
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,594
- [in Spanish] What do you want?
- Something happened, we need to talk.

140
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,119
I'm busy. I can't talk.

141
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,288
There's been an attempt on Judy.

142
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,502
She's saying a few things
you might want to hear.

143
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,133
Give me time.

144
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,929
What's going on?

145
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,183
Nothing that's my problem anymore.

146
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,186
Where you going?

147
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,355
I just want to make sure.

148
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,694
Fuck it. I don't want to know.

149
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,374
- Peña.
- [in Spanish] Mr. Peña has arrived.

150
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,002
Let's go. Search.

151
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:25,119
Kiko and I built all of this together.
This is all that is left for me.

152
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:29,915
What are the Castaños thinking?
That they can chase me out?

153
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,750
I'm not leaving.

154
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,919
They don't want you to leave,
they want to kill you.

155
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:40,009
And what about you?
You're in this with me too.

156
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:51,562
Look... you brought these guys here.
You got in bed with Cali.

157
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,772
This is all your doing.

158
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,734
This is a fight between narcos.
It's not my problem.

159
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,694
Don't call me again.

160
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,325
Berna, last I heard, leaking classified
intelligence is a federal offense.

161
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,620
Especially when it ends up
in the hands of a death squad

162
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,205
that's killed innocent people.

163
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:14,376
I'm sure some newspaper in America might
be interested in hearing more about that.

164
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,172
Are you threatening me?

165
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,383
Yes, I'm threatening you.

166
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,059
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

167
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,437
What do you want?

168
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,231
You're a cop.

169
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,401
You know perfectly well
where Montecasino is.

170
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,196
Where the Castaños are,
and the Rodriguezes.

171
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,490
Arrest them.

172
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,369
And when you do,
accidentally shoot them in the head.

173
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:53,249
- It doesn't work that way.
- Oh, no? Then how?

174
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,636
We'll do it my way.

175
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,599
[Berna]
So you want Judy to be a rat?

176
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,351
I don't agree with this, Javier.

177
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,854
We are narcos, but we have our honor.

178
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:21,861
Berna... you're a fucking drug dealer
who sells poison by the kilo.

179
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,239
Fuck your honor.

180
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,574
[soft chuckle]

181
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,159
Says you.

182
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,872
You've been happily working
with the information we've provided.

183
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,000
And what have you done?

184
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,754
If you have a better idea, go for it.

185
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,383
Otherwise, this is the deal.

186
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,886
Judy becomes a confidential informant
to the DEA.

187
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,306
She gives us Cali, everything she knows.

188
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:56,270
If you don't like it,
you can take on the Castaños alone.

189
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,149
[in English]
And you can go fuck yourself.

190
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,193
[Steve]
Best way to make a bad story go away

191
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,029
is to come up with a better story...

192
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,448
and sell it hard.

193
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,076
This is one of the cornerstones
of American foreign policy,

194
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,788
and one we learned through years
of trial and error in Latin America,

195
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,417
Chile, Guatemala, Panama.

196
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,003
Getting caught with your pants down sucks,

197
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,631
but if at the same time
you give the folks a big win,

198
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:28,218
like, say, dismantling the second biggest
drug cartel in the world,

199
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,221
well, then nobody's paying attention
to the bad story.

200
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,599
They're too busy patting you on the back.

201
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:38,938
Risky plan? Yes.
But pressure will force you to take risks.

202
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,315
It'll force you to do a lot of things.

203
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,068
[in Spanish] We haven't heard anything
from him for weeks.

204
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,446
We don't even know where he is.

205
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,240
[Hermilda] I don't know why
you're letting De Greiff come here.

206
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,117
He's coming to scare you.

207
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,245
And now you're losing faith in Pablo.

208
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,499
[gentle scoff]
You don't understand, do you?

209
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,921
We don't have any more money, Hermilda.

210
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,882
If they take our protection away,
we can't do anything else.

211
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,511
Pablo has many properties.
Don't be so dramatic, Tata.

212
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,013
You think someone
is going to invest in us?

213
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,224
They're going to give us their money?

214
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,314
No one is going to help us.

215
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,651
Everyone knows what that would mean.

216
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,124
Whatever he's doing...

217
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,754
wherever my son is,
he's doing it for his family.

218
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,507
Don't forget that.

219
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:20,372
[softly] Pablo? Pablo?
Can you hear me, Pablo? Please answer.

220
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,544
[bird calling in distance]

224
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,685
Tata?

225
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,647
Can you hear me?

229
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,964
[grunting]

230
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,685
[Miguel] That's a lot of product for men
who don't know how to run this business.

231
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:09,523
We have to be clear with them.
Their work isn't done.

232
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,817
Our donation to them is an advance.

233
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,487
Besides, we have to keep them happy.

234
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,283
Their connection with the Americans
is invaluable, brother.

235
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,326
What a fucking joke,

236
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,663
the CIA and their war
against the communists.

237
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:29,543
It's a joke, but that friendship
could save our lives one day.

238
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,714
What? Any news about Judy?

239
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:38,635
The Castaños took their first shot,
a bomb. But they didn't kill her.

240
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,181
Since when did it get so fucking hard
to kill someone?

241
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:46,476
What about her assistant?
The fat one, what do they call him? Berna?

242
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,563
He's the one we should kill.
She's just a loud-mouth bitch.

243
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,066
Don Berna. Him we found.

244
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,027
Where?

245
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,945
Here.

246
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,323
Out front.

247
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,001
[Gilberto]
Don Berna!

248
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,422
Welcome to Cali.

249
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,258
Gilberto, thank you, brother.

250
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,178
Forgive us, but we weren't expecting you.

251
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,141
Don't worry about it.
I'm here to speak to you all.

252
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,227
Very well, brother.

253
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,520
It's about Judy.

254
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,278
[in English]
Where's Peña?

255
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,198
What do you need?

256
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,705
I got a tip. A guy.

257
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,499
He says he may have a lead, man.

258
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,003
Yeah, well, why don't you, uh,
give it to Martinez?

259
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,715
Or you could give it
to your Los Pepes pals.

260
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,885
He wants to give it to an American.

261
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,515
Yeah, what's he got? Who is this guy?

262
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,975
He's a guy I know.

263
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,895
Come on, Murphy. He's safe.
He knows I work with you.

264
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,438
What, he doesn't trust you?

265
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,153
All right. Bring him in.

266
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,197
He's in Bogotá.

267
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,534
So I gotta go to Bogotá
to meet your friend? Forget it.

268
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,495
Come on, Murphy.

269
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,622
You want Escobar, don't you?

270
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,543
Please, talk to him.

271
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,837
It's really important.

272
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,341
- All right. Set it up.
- Okay.

273
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,635
[in Spanish]
Thanks. You won't regret it.

274
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,804
In English, please!

00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,842
Tata, are you there?

282
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:33,602
There's no signal here.
I don't know why you keep trying.

283
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,981
Why don't you come drink with us?

284
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,358
I'll be right there.

00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,421
There's coffee in the Thermos.

288
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,239
[man in Spanish]
He's communicating to his wife via radio.

289
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,533
Those are the codes and frequencies.

290
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,786
[in English]
Pablo is using a radio.

291
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,913
That's the way he communicates
with his wife.

292
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,791
And these are the codes, Murphy.

293
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:24,421
Yeah? Where did it come from
and how did you get it?

294
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:29,301
Lugo is a fiscal at the Tequendama.
He guards the family.

295
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,389
What do you want for this? Money? Visa?

296
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,225
[in Spanish]
What do you want, Lugo? Money? Visa?

297
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,429
It don't work that way, bud.

298
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:41,938
[in Spanish]
No visa, no money, you understand?

299
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:48,528
[in Spanish] Is that what he thinks? That
everyone wants to go to the United States?

300
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,573
I don't want anything.

301
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:56,328
All I want is for this to end soon and you
to understand the family is in pain.

302
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,788
Find him and kill him.

303
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,094
[in English]
So? What do you think?

304
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,978
Javi, he's given us everything.
We got codes, frequencies.

305
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,981
- I think it's real.
- Take it to Martinez.

306
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,078
I'm at the embassy. I gotta call you back.

307
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,152
What you doing at the embassy?
What's going on?

308
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,739
Nothing I can't handle.
I'll fill you in when I can.

309
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:36,034
- Javi, let's get on this.
- Murphy, take it to Martinez.

310
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,535
I'll call you later.

311
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,122
Peña's in Bogotá?

312
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,168
Yeah, Javi's into something. Shit.

313
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,129
I'll take the codes back.
You stay with Peña, okay?

314
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,053
No fucking way. The codes are staying
with me. I'll take it to Martinez.

315
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:58,890
We give Judy immunity,
take her testimony and we are covered.

316
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,684
Don't lie to me again, Peña.

317
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:07,732
This is a tier-one narco who's
ready to flip on other tier-one narcos.

318
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,113
She's been in the business for 30 years.
She knows Cali's operation.

319
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,949
It's not intel anyone can provide.

320
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,409
She has leverage over you.

321
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,455
Her information on Escobar
crippled his business.

322
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,833
She'll do the same to Cali,
only this time for us.

323
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,004
The moment she goes on record,
her leverage is gone.

324
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,512
She doesn't get immunity
until after she talks.

325
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,931
Get her on record
and we'll see what she's got.

326
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,642
Nobody seems to want to take on Cali.

327
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,812
They've been off-limits,
but this may do the trick.

328
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,025
And Peña. Be discreet. Tell no one.

329
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,861
There are people in this building
who won't like it.

You don't know how to tie a knot.

In Bogotá, 222-50-12.
In Medellín, 461-11-11.

345
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,776
[birds calling]

346
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,458
The kids would love to be here.

347
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,923
I've been thinking...

348
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,763
I could buy some land here next to you.

349
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,895
Some cows, maybe some sheep.

350
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,317
And have my own farm.

351
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,541
We could run it together.

352
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,758
What do you think?

353
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,277
We need to finish putting up the wire.

354
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,211
Do you remember when the soldiers
came to our village?

355
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:26,217
You were a tough little boy,
probably only seven or eight years old.

356
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:32,098
But even in that moment,
you were already the man of the house.

357
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:39,898
In the face of all that
violence and death, you were strong.

358
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,609
You are a survivor.

359
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,278
A man of action.

360
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:50,617
I knew that day you were destined
for great things, Pablo.

361
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,079
- [Martinez in Spanish] Good evening.
- [men] Colonel.

362
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,456
Sit.

363
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,920
So, did you decipher those codes?
Are they real?

364
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,714
Yes, Colonel. I verified the frequencies.

365
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,008
The codes are the same ones
Escobar's wife is using.

366
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:11,179
- He'll use them when he calls her.
- Did you confirm it's Escobar?

367
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,262
Did you hear him?

368
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,058
No, Colonel, not yet.

369
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,020
[in English] All right, say he picks up
the phone. How close can we get?

370
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,649
If Pablo talks in Medellín,
we'll know every word he says.

371
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,277
- Can you get his exact location?
- If it's within range, yes.

372
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,616
All right, if Pablo uses the phone
outside of Medellín with the same codes,

373
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,909
can you hear him?

374
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,581
No. The antenna is not that strong.

375
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:06,234
Why didn't you answer me when I asked
about me coming here with my family?

376
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,445
I wasn't paying that much attention.

377
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,740
But you're paying attention to me now,
right?

378
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,497
So, what do you think?

379
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,002
- It's a nice idea.
- Yes, it's a nice idea.

380
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,841
It's a nice idea, now help me.
Put that bucket down here.

381
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,142
Now hold on to the pig.

382
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,312
Fuck!

383
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,234
[father]
Funny that you don't like blood.

384
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,487
How strange.

385
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,323
What are you trying to say?

386
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,414
Clean yourself.

387
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,921
[soft chuckle]

388
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,675
You know what's funny?

389
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,308
That my dad...

390
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:27,440
has no fucking idea who I am.

391
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,945
- I know very well who you are.
- Mmm.

392
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:39,285
Did you know that I was
one of the world's richest men?

393
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,536
Is that right?

394
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,790
You know the President
of the United States knows who I am?

395
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,459
- The United States? Disgusting.
- Mmm.

396
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:52,256
I was elected to the
House of Representatives of this country.

397
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,803
Your last name is known throughout
the whole world because of what I did.

398
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,015
- So what? So what? So what?!
- So what?!

399
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,894
And what about you? What about you?!

400
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:13,236
Ignorant old man. Who lives alone.

401
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,114
On this shithole farm.

402
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,868
Who doesn't know his own grandchildren.

403
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,039
Not even one fucking picture of them here.

404
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,544
Mmm.

405
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,630
So I'm nothing more than
an ignorant old man?

406
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,967
That's right.

407
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,932
Now tell me... [shaky chuckle]

408
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,768
Tell me...

409
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,231
what you think of me.

410
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,280
- Who cares?
- I do.

411
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,990
[drops knife]

412
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,117
It's important to me.

413
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:08,166
You wanted to come live on this farm
with your wife and kids.

414
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,461
But that's not possible, Pablo.

415
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,382
You chose your life!

416
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,843
Be in charge of it.

417
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,222
You want me to tell you
what I think of you?

418
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,226
I'm ashamed.

419
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,858
I think you're a murderer.

420
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,948
At last, the truth.

421
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,705
At last, the truth.

422
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,209
[voice quavers] A truth...

423
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,048
that breaks my heart.

424
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,888
Leave me alone.

425
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,800
Limón.

426
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,845
Yes, sir?

427
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,061
You like it here, right?

428
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,187
[soft chuckle]

429
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,731
Yes, boss. It's a peaceful place.

430
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,859
[whispers] Peaceful.

431
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,488
[sighs]

432
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,824
Kneel down.

433
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:22,675
A few kilometers from here, in a field,
you will find a big tree.

434
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,638
Under that tree is a buried case of money.

435
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,017
Go get it.

436
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,351
Are we leaving, boss?

437
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,729
[softly] Yes.

438
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,897
Go on.

439
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,824
[sighs]

440
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,960
[De Greiff]
That's correct, Mrs. Escobar.

441
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:02,548
How long did you think this arrangement
was going to last?

442
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,885
[Tata] Do you not realize that if
we leave here, they're going to kill us?

443
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:12,725
If you desire, you have the right
to contract private security services.

444
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:16,270
Tell us how. We don't have a dime.

445
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:20,775
That is not our problem.
Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry.

446
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,151
You're sorry?

447
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,654
Then help us find asylum
in another country.

448
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,700
I don't have an issue with you
leaving Colombia. But...

449
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,744
But you can't help us find asylum.

450
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:37,875
[slams table]

451
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,543
That's bullshit!

452
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,004
They're going to...

453
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,382
[whispers] ...kill us all.

454
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,468
Mama, what's wrong?

455
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,973
[whispers] Nothing, my love.

456
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,071
I'm sorry, Attorney General...

457
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,867
but I don't know what else to do.

458
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:23,045
If you're in contact with your husband,
I advise you to express your concern.

459
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,047
Tell him to surrender.

460
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:30,636
The power of the law is your last hope.

461
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,806
Think about your children.

462
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,785
[thumping]

463
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,555
[sniffs]

464
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,937
Shit.

465
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,517
- No. [whines]
- Yes, before you go to sleep.

466
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,853
- Do you like it? Yes?
- No. No. [babbles]

467
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,242
[rustling]

468
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,204
[soft noises in next room]

469
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,638
Fuck.

470
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,726
Jhon. What are you doing here?

471
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:34,820
Where is the money?
The money we gave you. I need it back.

472
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,531
We spent it. It's gone.

473
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,451
Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.

474
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,290
You've already hurt me.

475
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,418
You fucked up my life.

476
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:00,596
I want to put the baby in her crib.
Can I put her down?

477
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,599
Hang on, Maritza.

478
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,493
And this?

479
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,626
That's all we have, Jhon.
It's all we have. We need it.

480
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:34,963
Please, don't take it. Please.
It's for the baby, please!

481
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,717
You lying... bitch! Get off!

482
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,595
Motherfucker! Bastard!

483
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,432
I should turn you in for the reward!
You deserve it!

484
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:49,228
- Sooner or later, they'll find you anyway.
- [baby whimpering]

485
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,481
What did you say?

486
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:57,211
Are you going to say something? Hmm?
Are you going to rat on me?

487
00:44:57,277 --> 00:45:00,697
I might! Why shouldn't I?

488
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:07,413
What? So now you're a killer?
Like your hero? [spits]

489
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,915
Jhon!

490
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,335
I know you! Get that shit out...

491
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,337
- [gunshot]
- [gasps]

492
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,209
[turns off engine]

493
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,102
- Boss, I did what you asked.
- Show me.

494
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,189
But I have bad news.

495
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,316
- What happened?
- Look.

496
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,576
It's rotten, sir.

497
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,591
There was half a million dollars
in that fucking case.

498
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,728
This is what I could retrieve, sir.

499
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:57,314
There's about six thousand dollars.
I counted, boss.

500
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,911
Get your things. We're leaving.

501
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,624
[Judy] Remember, you and I
are partners in all this.

502
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:20,003
[Javier] Everything's set.
We have to do this tonight.

503
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,087
Where?

504
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,215
It's a safe house in El Poblado.

505
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,175
We've used it before.

506
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,886
Berna knows where.

507
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,097
[Judy]
I'll see you there.

508
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,909
Everything is ready, Judy. Get in.

509
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,745
Let's go, Flaco.

510
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,171
[in English]
She's on her way.

511
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,555
[in Spanish]
I know what you're thinking.

512
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,644
I'm making a mistake. [chuckles]

513
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:22,816
You'll be taken care of
like you've taken care of me.

514
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:26,361
The only thing that needs to happen
is to get rid of the Cali cartel.

515
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,613
Up here, Flaco.

516
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,379
I can't protect a rat.

517
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,720
[static, stops]

518
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:05,025
I didn't think you'd betray me.

519
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,612
You were going to get yourself killed,
Judy.

520
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,282
So now, you're going to get on that plane.

521
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,285
And if I don't, what? What happens?

522
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,330
If you don't get on,
then you'll leave with the Castaños.

523
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,457
And I won't protect you anymore.

524
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,240
Tell me something.

525
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,576
Did Cali arrange this?

526
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,581
How much did they offer you?
At least tell me that.

527
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:05,711
It's a mutual understanding.
I'll work with the Castaños.

528
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:11,216
They don't understand our business,
but they'll be useful in mine.

529
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:15,053
- So you fucked over your partner.
- I was never your partner.

530
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,848
I only protected your life.

531
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:23,895
Relax. You'll have money.

532
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:27,232
The Americans said they'd make sure
you had everything you need.

533
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,986
- Where am I going?
- Doesn't matter.

534
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:36,533
Go. And never come back to Colombia.

535
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,833
Don't worry about a thing.

536
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:51,214
You'll still be a rat, but for the CIA,
instead of the DEA.

537
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,072
[in English]
Hey, man. How's it going?

538
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,075
Everything good at the safe house?

539
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,954
- Where's Messina?
- Oh, she's gone.

540
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,792
Reassigned. Headed home.

541
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:30,879
Likely to spend the rest of her career
busting meth labs in Indianapolis.

542
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,215
Something about chain of command.

543
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,884
- And Judy?
- You didn't hear?

544
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:41,848
Judy has an interview
with the Miami Herald in, uh...

545
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,850
oh, about five hours.

546
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,896
Now I can't be certain,
but I bet she has a story to tell

547
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:52,192
about the involvement of a certain
DEA agent with Los Pepes.

548
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,489
All I know for sure is,
whatever Judy has to say,

549
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,658
it won't be pointed in my direction.

550
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:02,911
You should've stayed in your lane.

551
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,205
[whispers] Wow.

552
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,375
And Cali too, right?

553
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,586
They get a pass?

554
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,801
How much do they pay you
for your protection?

555
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,219
Pay me?

556
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,596
[gentle scoff]

557
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,890
Let me tell you something, Agent Peña.

558
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,102
Maybe it'll make you feel better,
but maybe not.

559
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:32,691
We're gonna get them someday.
But not your way.

560
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:37,904
For everything you know, you're, uh...
extremely naive.

561
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,657
Anyway, I've enjoyed this.

562
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,409
The laughs.

563
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,452
Um... Oh.

564
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,580
I think the ambassador wants to see you.

565
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,418
I guess word about this Miami Herald thing
is spreading like a prairie fire.

566
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:53,837
And bring your passport.

567
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,715
I think you're going home, but...

568
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,093
you didn't hear that from me.

569
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,616
Tata?

570
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,034
[static]

571
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,415
Tata, can you hear me?

572
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,542
[Tata] Pablo?

573
00:54:58,294 --> 00:54:59,963
It's me, my love.

574
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,049
Finally, I can speak to you, my love.

575
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,301
I've missed you so much.

576
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,013
Where have you been, Pablo?

577
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:14,102
I had to do something very important.

578
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,525
But I'm back home, my love.

579
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,655
I'm home.
