1
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,569
Escobar had made a career out of terror.

2
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,613
And for the most part, it had worked.

3
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,159
But when he parked 220 pounds of TNT

4
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,037
outside of a downtown Bogotá
shopping center

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,706
a week before school started up again,

6
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,167
no one could deny he had gone too far.

7
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,837
The whole nation was enraged.

8
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,883
There was no explaining this one away.

9
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,512
And no hiding from it.

10
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,932
DEATH TO ESCOBAR

11
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,603
Forgive me.

12
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,067
Children and innocent people
died in that bombing.

13
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,820
That was an act of pure terrorism.
It must be answered for.

14
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,490
Surrender, unconditionally, now.

15
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:18,369
What kind of country is it
when a death squad is not only tolerated

16
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,081
but is actually sanctioned
by the goddamn government?

17
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,042
Do you want to see Bogotá
turned into a crater?

18
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:29,631
Is that what it will take to protect
my family from those bastards, Los Pepes?

19
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:34,010
No. Your family's safety
is our utmost concern.

20
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:39,808
They're simply... in protective custody.

21
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,436
Get my family out of Colombia.

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,564
We can get your family out of Colombia.

23
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:53,404
But I can't guarantee any country
will accept them.

24
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,783
I don't have that kind of power.

25
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,953
You better find that kind of power,

26
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,749
because I won't even discuss surrender
until my family is out of the country.

27
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,919
Until then, we have nothing to talk about.

28
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,129
That's right.

29
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:14,134
A guy who knew no bounds, no limits,
had finally gone too far.

30
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:18,096
He probably didn't know it then,
or maybe he just couldn't accept it,

31
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:22,767
but the end was coming for him,
and it was about time.

32
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,777
Congressional leaders
are calling for immediate action

33
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,240
and President Gaviria has called an
emergency meeting of the national police.

34
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,092
Yesterday's bombing
has resulted in a total of...

35
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,952
Now he's really fucked up.

36
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,666
Pacho... I want you on a plane to Miami.

37
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,252
It's time.

38
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,464
And Escobar's family? Should we get them?

39
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,802
No, not now. They're surrounded by police.

40
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,930
They're not going anywhere.

41
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,811
Son of a bitch.

42
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,498
Stay there. You can go.

43
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,208
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

44
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:03,219
Agent Jimenez, put out that cigarette
and go downstairs, please.

45
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,057
- And don't smoke in the room again.
- Yes, sir.

46
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,601
Thank you.

47
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,563
Excuse me.

48
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,943
- Who wants dinner?
- Me!

49
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,532
Stop looking out the window.
There's no one out there.

50
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,200
Come eat something.

51
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,453
- Mama?
- Yes, my love?

52
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,538
Who are Los Pepes?

53
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,962
No one. No one you have to worry about.
All right, my love?

54
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,006
And how much longer do we have to be here?

55
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,674
Not much longer, love. Keep eating.

56
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,177
Can I speak with you a moment?

57
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,476
- We have to do something, Hermilda.
- Pablo will fix this, like always.

58
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,686
We can't even call him.

59
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,649
Even if we could,
all the telephones are tapped anyway.

60
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,697
We're alone, Hermilda.

61
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,701
And you're telling me
everything will be okay?

62
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,388
Our situation with Escobar
is coming to a head.

63
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,933
Due to our efforts,
his organization is shrinking.

64
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:37,063
Intel suggests that his inner circle
has been reduced to a few loyal sicarios.

65
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,773
Bit of a mixed blessing.

66
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,692
Fewer sicarios,
less radio chatter for me to trace.

67
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,153
We had a tap put on that lawyer's phone,

68
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,239
but I guess he isn't
taking any more calls.

69
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,491
It's Los Pepes.

70
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:54,956
They kill Fernando Duque,
but they also killed his son... his wife.

71
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,209
But they also stabbed, viciously,
his innocent mother.

72
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,506
But I accepted a sad truth.

73
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,302
No one is willing to police Los Pepes,
so we're gonna concentrate on Escobar.

74
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,015
I would also like to say that...

75
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:18,771
I know that someone
has been in contact with Los Pepes.

76
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,190
And while it sickens me...

77
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,529
there's nothing I can or will do about it.

78
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,741
But the man standing over Escobar
when this is over

79
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,661
needs to be a Colombian police officer.

80
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,122
And not some vigilante.

81
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,377
- Thank you.
- Excuse me, Colonel...

82
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,884
Guten tag.

83
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,930
Join the DEA, see the world, right?

84
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,850
The airport, anyways.

85
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,529
Listen...

86
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,450
I need you to prepare yourself
for some blowback.

87
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,578
It goes high up.

88
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,875
And these people aren't gonna like it
when I try to get myself out of it.

89
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,423
If they come after you
about what I've been doing,

90
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,383
you protect yourself first.

91
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,970
You didn't know anything.

92
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,056
Understand?

93
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,352
What are you gonna do?

94
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,481
I don't fucking know.

95
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,025
We've all gone off the rails down here,
Javi.

96
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,110
You heard what Martinez said.

97
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,656
If we're standing over Pablo
at the end of this, we win.

98
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,326
We can get out of this clean.

99
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,914
So I want you to think about that

100
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,417
before you make any more decisions
that you might regret.

101
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,308
Blackie. What's going on?

102
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,687
- Do you think you can get inside?
- No, boss. I don't think so.

103
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,398
With all the police swarming around,
it's impossible.

104
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,609
Can you see the top floor?
Through the windows?

105
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,154
No, I can't. It's too difficult.

106
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,449
Keep your eyes on it, Blackie.
You might see something.

107
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,577
Sure, boss.

108
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,371
All right, as soon as you see anything,
call me.

109
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,752
Blackie, it's important
that I know they're okay.

110
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,672
Hey, boss.

111
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,216
Can you believe it?

112
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,595
Just this second,
Tata came into view, boss.

113
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,597
What do you see? Is she alone?

114
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,224
She looks beautiful. She's at the window.

115
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:04,395
She's got that dress on that you had me
bring from Miami, remember, boss?

116
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,813
The one you like so much.

117
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,109
The children, Blackie. Can you see them?

118
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,571
There, I can see Manuela, boss.

119
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,993
- Can she see you?
- She looks so pretty, boss.

120
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,704
Go.

121
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,206
Blackie...

122
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,418
thanks for this.

123
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,518
Remember when people used to
call Pablo Escobar the paisa Robin Hood?

124
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,687
Well, that shit was over.

125
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,941
The bombing had shocked
even his staunchest supporters.

126
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,278
Many of the folks of Medellín
who had always protected him

127
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,238
were seeing him in a different light.

128
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,002
And no one knew that better
than Los Pepes.

129
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,660
They took out ads in local papers,

130
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,829
getting the word out
to Escobar's former allies:

131
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,873
Pablo was through. Join Los Pepes or die.

132
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,709
PABLO ESCOBAR - IN DEFENSE
OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE, LOS PEPES

133
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,795
And the traffickers
who didn't read the newspapers,

134
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,548
like the Gallón gang, for example,
who I doubt could even read,

135
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,260
got an in-person visit from Los Pepes'
most glamorous ambassador.

136
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,346
- Héctor.
- Sir.

137
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,349
Do me a favor and bring Miss Judy a beer.

138
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,142
- Of course, boss.
- Thanks.

139
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,770
This isn't about Pablo.
Pablo is a dead man.

140
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,482
It's just a matter of time.
We're here to talk about the future.

141
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:36,612
And if you're interested in the future,
then you'll have to join us. Mmm.

142
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:41,200
Listen, Judy,
you know we never had problems with Pablo.

143
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:45,162
Plus, we had a very good relationship
with Kiko. Right, Berna?

144
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,207
- Yes.
- And that's why we made the decision

145
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,084
to stay out of this shit.

146
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,796
And that has been a good decision
for business as well?

147
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,007
Because things are very difficult.

148
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:01,220
And when all this shit is over,
the organization will change,

149
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,056
the routes will change,
this whole city will change.

150
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:12,106
And how do you know
you'll still be in business, Judy?

151
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,400
That's why I'm talking to you.

152
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,819
If all of us from Medellín are united,

153
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,947
we'll be able to say what happens
to each one of us.

154
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,414
Meet me at Montecasino
with our associates,

155
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,833
and you tell them you're on our side.

156
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,132
She wants them to join Los Pepes.

157
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,098
They say Pablo Escobar is fucked,
that his time has come.

158
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,518
And that they have to decide
whose side they're on.

159
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,856
- What did they say?
- They're joining.

160
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,403
Here's the information.

161
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,615
They have a meeting
with the Castaños on Friday.

162
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,534
This is big, boss.

163
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:10,789
If the Gallóns are with them,
maybe some of the other guys are too, huh?

164
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,085
When is it?

165
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,963
Friday at 9:00 p.m., boss.

166
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,674
Take that address...

167
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,512
and go to Montecasino.

168
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,764
Take Limón with you.

169
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,017
And find out what's going on over there.

170
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,310
Quica.

171
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,147
Are you all right?

172
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,941
Yes, boss.

173
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,282
How many men can we rely on?

174
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,455
I think I can round up a hundred.
But we need cash.

175
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,960
How much money do we have on hand?

176
00:13:56,043 --> 00:14:02,758
If we collect all the money in
the stash houses, that should be enough.

177
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:06,595
It's... around this much.

178
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,475
I'm still waiting on a cash shipment
from Miami.

179
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,436
But it's harder than ever
to get it through.

180
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:21,986
Make sure we have the weapons and the men
we need when the time comes. Got it?

181
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:26,699
The only thing that matters now is getting
Tata and the children out of the country.

182
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,580
Then we can take care of business.

183
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,665
Go on.

184
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,125
Yes, sir.

185
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,183
You want to get that?

186
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,564
- Murphy.
- Get to Bogotá right away.

187
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,399
- Yeah? What for?
- A tier-one sicario

188
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,483
in police headquarters.

189
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,278
- Oh, who?
- Nelson Hernández.

190
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,864
You know a Nelson Hernández?

191
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,701
- No.
- Yeah, tier-one my ass.

192
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,119
AKA Blackie.

193
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,662
No shit. Blackie.

194
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,415
CNP just picked him up
outside of the Tequendama.

195
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,498
Get in a room with him
and see what he can give us.

196
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,710
We're already gone.

197
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,422
Bogotá police just busted Blackie.
Maybe he'll cut us a deal.

198
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,301
Nabbing Blackie was a huge deal for us.

199
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,178
Bad news for Pablo.

200
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,014
And there was more bad news
coming his way.

201
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,438
The thing about drug dealers is
you can't trust them for shit.

202
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,776
The Lion had been running Pablo's
Miami operation for years,

203
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,860
and gotten rich too.

204
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,530
But the moment Cali
offered him a better deal,

205
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,408
he welcomed his new partners
with open arms.

206
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,286
I mean, who could blame the Lion?

207
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,665
Pablo was on his way out
and Cali was the future.

208
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,209
He had introduced them
to Pablo's bankers...

209
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,126
Oh, thank you.

210
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,212
...his smugglers, all of it.

211
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,214
Though Pablo didn't know it yet,

212
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,549
his biggest rivals
had pulled off a silent coup.

213
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,051
Pass that to me.

214
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,431
They had stolen the crown jewel
in his empire right out from under him.

215
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,810
- Guys.
- And they didn't even have to fire a shot.

216
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,689
Nothing relevant happened today.

217
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,818
Corrupt politicians, celebrity divorces.
Bullshit.

218
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,196
You don't like it, go work at CNN.

219
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,198
- Miss Velez.
- Yes, honey?

220
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,176
I'm sorry for interrupting,
but you have a call...

221
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,494
Take a message, I'm about to go on air.

222
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:39,039
Yes, but it's Pablo Escobar's wife.
She says it's urgent.

223
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,758
What are you doing? Answer the call.

224
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,891
You have to get her
to give you an interview.

225
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,733
Hello?

226
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,946
Hello?

227
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,618
I know that you and I have had
a lot of problems in the past.

228
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,206
But I need you to help me.

229
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,794
While everyone could agree
that Escobar had to go down,

230
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,797
there was a lot of disagreement
on how to make that happen.

231
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,260
Escobar was still dangerous and many
in government wanted him to surrender.

232
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,096
To them, holding his family
was not only immoral,

233
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,182
but it could lead to more violence.

234
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,727
An upcoming presidential election
made it a big issue.

235
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,980
Gaviria was under a lot of pressure
to let the family go.

236
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,525
And it was getting harder and harder
for him to resist.

237
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:53,655
I brought all the
influence the party can bear on Gaviria.

238
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:01,497
And it seems he has agreed
to find asylum for your family.

239
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,166
Where?

240
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,502
No, that remains to be seen.

241
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,714
But we will meet in his office,

242
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,095
I suppose to discuss the terms
of their relocation.

243
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,555
Thank you, sir.

244
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,433
- You're a man of your word.
- I am.

245
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,061
Now you must be of your word.

246
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,773
I will. Be sure of that.

247
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:32,569
The moment my family is safe,
we will speak again.

248
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,947
- Until then.
- Thank you.

249
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,867
She's here.

250
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,410
Bring her here.

251
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,562
Hello, Valeria.

252
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,776
I liked it more with the hood on.

253
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,907
I told them, don't take me anywhere
that doesn't have a beautiful pool.

254
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,289
It's very dangerous
to be my friend these days.

255
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,210
Come on.

256
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:49,813
Look. These are the codes for the radio.
I'll put them here.

257
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,399
And here is some cash.

258
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,488
This is for you.

259
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,575
- No, Pablo. I don't want your money.
- It's for your help.

260
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,207
I'm doing this for you.

261
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,723
Thank you.

262
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,606
I'm worried about you, Pablo.

263
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,754
You guys can't do shit to me.

264
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,925
De Greiff offered us amnesty.

265
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,469
That's right.

266
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,889
But you have to talk to get it.

267
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,726
You want to negotiate, gringo?

268
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,187
You want to negotiate? Let's negotiate.

269
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,357
I'll give you something. Something small.

270
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,818
Blackie...

271
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,991
Blackie, Blackie, Blackie.

272
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,830
What name did your mother give you?

273
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,585
Nelson Hernández... Lucumí.

274
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,920
Lucumí?

275
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,675
From the Pacific.

276
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:48,348
Lucumí, they found explosive residue
on your hands.

277
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,477
On your jacket, everywhere.

278
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,705
They're going to blame you
for that bomb, Lucumí.

279
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,585
Hey...

280
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,841
- I had nothing to do with it.
- We know that.

281
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,721
We know it wasn't your idea.
We know you're not the boss.

282
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,520
Don't let them blame you for this.

283
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:40,609
Don't let them see you as the one
who killed all those innocent children.

284
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,283
Help us and we'll help you.

285
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,372
Give us Pablo.

286
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:58,585
No fucking way. I can't give you Pablo.

287
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,588
No fucking way I give you the boss.

288
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,257
Then give us something.

289
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,720
You have to give us something
or they'll hang you.

290
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,814
I'll give you...

291
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,526
La Quica.

292
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,574
Faggots.

293
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,681
There's a lot of them.

294
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,602
Do you think we can take all of them?

295
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,397
What's wrong, brother?

296
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,942
You're turning into a pussy.

297
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,822
If you're scared, why don't you run away?

298
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,533
Abandon the boss.
It's that easy, brother.

299
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,077
No, brother.

300
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,331
I'm loyal to the boss.

301
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,586
And if I have to die, I'll die, brother.

302
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,963
You better, motherfucker.

303
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,529
This is the biggest lead we've ever had.

304
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,240
- La Quica can give us Pablo.
- We can help triangulate from the air,

305
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,308
but really only units on the ground
can find him.

306
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:40,896
So that means that we have to drive around
Medellín hoping to get lucky

307
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,248
and La Quica is using his phone?

308
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,066
He will be because we'll be calling him
with Blackie's phone.

309
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,152
He picks up, we get a signal.

310
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,572
Tracking phones like this
is all about proximity.

311
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,491
- If you have the number.
- The number we got.

312
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,412
Okay. And who else has his number?

313
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,667
I mean, who else is gonna show up
when we track it down?

314
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,505
Just us.

315
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,885
Okay.

316
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,930
- Trujillo.
- Yes, Colonel.

317
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,806
Prepare the emergency team.

318
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,309
They need to be ready
when we get the signal.

319
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,562
- Yes, Colonel.
- Martinez, get your people ready.

320
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,774
We'll start tracking them
first thing tomorrow.

321
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,442
At your service, Colonel.

322
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,001
Good work on Blackie.

323
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,131
I need to know you didn't make the call.

324
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,805
The only thing I want
is to get that son of a bitch Escobar.

325
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,682
It's the only thing I want, Peña.

326
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,143
- For all the lives he has taken.
- I know.

327
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,939
But not with them.

328
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,694
I believe firmly in what the colonel said.

329
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:15,407
When Escobar dies, a Colombian cop
should be standing over him.

330
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,293
- Good evening, Ms. Velez.
- Good evening.

331
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,920
Welcome, they're expecting you.

332
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,510
What is she doing here?

333
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,391
I sent for her.

334
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,394
Please, take the children to their room.

335
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,522
Please.

336
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,483
Let's go. Let's go.

337
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,415
This is from Pablo.

338
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,629
It's a radio telephone,
so you can speak with him.

339
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,217
This is a cipher sheet
for the frequencies he'll be on all day.

340
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,056
You must keep it hidden.

341
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,020
He also sent you money.

342
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,111
Thank you.

343
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:48,750
Well, let's do the interview already.

344
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,923
You know what? Another time.

345
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,759
When all of this is over.

346
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,942
I'm supposed to be interviewing you.
I can't leave so quickly.

347
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,031
Then stay.

348
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,077
You can show yourself out
when you're ready.

349
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,921
Pablo?

350
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,468
Tata.

351
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,723
Pablo, is it you?

352
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,852
So good to hear your voice, my love.

353
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,148
How are you, Tata?

354
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,192
How are our children?

355
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,570
My love, we're all okay.

356
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,572
We need you.

357
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,198
And I need you.

358
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,618
Listen, I'm going
to get you out of there soon.

359
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,329
I talked to the attorney general.
Everything is ready.

360
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,664
Shh.

361
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,834
Just hearing your voice, I feel calm.

362
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,212
I love you very much.

363
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,591
I love you, my darling. I love you...

364
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:43,072
Mr. President, I ask you
not to take this as a failure.

365
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,369
Escobar will be brought to justice.

366
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,664
And once his family is out of Colombia,

367
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:56,044
he will reinitiate negotiations
for his surrender.

368
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,172
- I already did that.
- Yes.

369
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:03,134
Well, I've got a list here

370
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:08,431
of possible locations that would be safe
for the Escobar family.

371
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:14,354
If you ask officially,
those countries will allow them to enter.

372
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,401
Attorney General De Greiff...

373
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,363
it seems you've been misinformed.

374
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,661
Escobar's family isn't going anywhere.

375
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,206
Pardon me?

376
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,834
I won't lift a finger to find them asylum.

377
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:41,089
I am categorically opposed
to you or anyone else doing so.

378
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,424
Do you know what that means?

379
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,344
There will be no surrender.

380
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:50,181
The violence will not end.

381
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,601
And you will be the one responsible.

382
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,188
You... will be the one responsible.

383
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,777
Your promises and negotiations
have only brought us more violence,

384
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,445
while making him stronger.

385
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:10,201
This, Mr. De Greiff, doesn't end
with Pablo Escobar's surrender.

386
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,495
This...

387
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,083
This ends with his death.

388
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,214
No, you don't need to worry
about anything.

389
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,218
Put yourself at ease. We got it.

390
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:32,223
Miami is ours.
I'll be back in Colombia tonight.

391
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,736
- Hi, there.
- How's it going?

392
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,697
What's up, little Lion?

393
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,033
Doing good. Just hanging out.

394
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,910
Is everything packed or what?

395
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,706
I don't get why you're staying
in this dump, brother.

396
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,500
I would have thought that Pacho Herrera

397
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,546
would be staying in a five star hotel
with all the bells and whistles...

398
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,324
- Do you want juice, my love?
- Yes.

399
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,867
I'll take more.

400
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,149
PABLO'S WHORE

401
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,827
So my business is done? Is that right?

402
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,079
I can't get anyone on the phone, sir.

403
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:23,501
I called many times. Many times.

404
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:28,214
I called everyone in Miami.
There's no trace of the Lion.

405
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,307
Pablo!

406
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:48,943
Tata?

407
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,780
Pablo, they killed her.
They dumped her in front of the hotel.

408
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,323
Who?

409
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,120
Valeria.

410
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,088
Are you all okay?

411
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,967
Yes, we're okay.

412
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Listen.

413
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,598
I need you to be strong.

414
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:23,478
Everything will end soon. But you need
to be stronger than ever, Tata.

415
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,814
I'll call you back soon.

416
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,566
I love you very much.

417
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,535
Tonight...

418
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,748
we're going to fight
like we've never fought before.

419
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,002
We'll fight with everything we have.

420
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,590
Fuck the Cali cartel!

421
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,342
Fuck Judy Moncada!

422
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,886
Fuck Los Castaños!

423
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,515
We're going to show these motherfuckers
who they are messing with,

424
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,643
because we're still the Medellín cartel

425
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:08,189
and tonight we're going to Montecasino!

426
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,987
Bring all the men we can buy.

427
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:19,784
Go to Medellín,
to every money stash we have

428
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,286
and bring me every penny you can find.

429
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,665
Limón and Quica
will take me to Montecasino,

430
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:31,587
because tonight we'll be fighting
side by side to the death.

431
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,882
And when those motherfuckers
open their doors to the Gallóns,

432
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,136
we'll go in and hit them
with everything we have!

433
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,596
- Got it?
- Yes, boss.

434
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,348
Boss...

435
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,352
I think I should go with Rojas.

436
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,105
It's too dangerous.

437
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,320
Okay.

438
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,866
Take Ricardo with you.

439
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,493
As you wish, boss.

440
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,453
Let's go, brother.

441
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,542
- Let's go, go, go!
- Quickly!

442
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,505
Let's go!

443
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,348
Let's go! Let's go!

444
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,201
There. After that corner. Right there.

445
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,125
What are the odds that we survive tonight?

446
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,672
Fifty-fifty.
But that's pretty good for us.

447
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,258
Let's do this quickly.

448
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:08,267
With Hugo Jr.'s RDF
surveillance team using Blackie's phone,

449
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:12,271
we had a real chance of tracking La Quica.
We just needed a little luck.

450
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:16,108
- I think we're ready.
- We've cast as wide a net as possible.

451
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,403
Guys, are we good?

452
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,780
Go ahead.

453
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,657
Go ahead, Murphy.

454
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,034
Copy that. Centra Spike, you standing by?

455
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,456
We are in the air.
Condition one, Murphy. Make your call.

456
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,085
All we had to do was call him,
hope he was in the area,

457
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,670
pray he picked up,

458
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:39,632
and then keep him on the line long enough
for our triangulation to pick up the ping.

459
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:44,095
And then snatch him up
without getting killed. Easy, right?

460
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,475
Hello? Hello?

461
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,771
I can't hear you. Hello, hello?

462
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,482
Damn it.

463
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,236
It was him.

464
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,447
Let's go.

465
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,201
Let's go to 10th and 32nd street.

466
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,291
I need him on longer, guys.

467
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,086
Get him back on the phone. Keep him on.

468
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,844
Answer it.

469
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,890
Fucking answer it. Could be the boss.

470
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,143
Hello?

471
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,187
Quica.

472
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,813
Hello.

473
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,525
Shit. Who the fuck is this?

474
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:43,362
- Hello, Quica. How's it going, my friend?
- Motherfucker. Who is this?

475
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:48,409
Calm down, Quica.
Don't be nervous. What's up, Quica?

476
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,536
Who the fuck do you think you are, bitch?

477
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,707
Hey, guys, we got a hit. He's in Laureles.

478
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,460
- Velén, let's go!
- Let's go, they're in Laureles!

479
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,103
Hey, Rojas, wait for me.
You're leaving me behind.

480
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:27,156
- Murphy, Peña, one more time.
- Copy, copy. We're calling again.

481
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:36,998
Hello?

482
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,669
Quica. What's up, Quica?

483
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,215
Quica, Quica, Quica.
What time is it, Quica?

484
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,675
- What are you up to, Quica?
- Bastard.

485
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:55,184
You're the accountant. How much is there?

486
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,228
I don't know. Maybe $500,000.

487
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:03,984
Looks like you're almost out of money.
Leave some for the market, fat ass.

488
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,278
So funny.

489
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,988
Why aren't you watching the car...

490
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:23,087
Sorry, but this toss of the coin...
doesn't seem like a good idea to me.

491
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,922
Let's make a deal...

492
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,730
Motherfucker.

493
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,150
Here we go.

494
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,579
We got eyes on La Quica. He's
traveling in a blue Sedan, heading east.

495
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,705
Go right.

496
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,374
Pussies.

497
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,810
He's making a right
on calle cuatro. All units!

498
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,604
Copy that! We're on it!

499
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,818
Trujillo, double back on my six.

500
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,404
Perez,
close all of 4th street. Go straight.

501
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,822
We'll go this way to cut him off.

502
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,956
Come on, pussy.

503
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,883
There! Follow him!

504
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,304
Follow him! Follow him! Follow him!
To the right, the right!

505
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,766
Come on, box him in!

506
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,649
All units, be ready for the play.

507
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,496
Stop!

508
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,831
Now I had my own history with La Quica,

509
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,418
and believe me, I would've liked
to beat him to death right then and there.

510
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,212
And I bet nobody would've cared.

511
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,131
La Quica's exploits were legendary.

512
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,301
He was Escobar's most prolific killer

513
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,888
and the guy credited for putting
the Avianca bomber on the plane.

514
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,725
But he was also his most trusted guy.
And if we could get him to flip...

515
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,893
Fucker.

516
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,853
...that would close the book on Pablo.

517
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,023
Limón.

518
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,609
Relax.

519
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,571
Okay, boss.

520
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,326
- Are we ready?
- They're all waiting for us, boss.

521
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,578
I think we have enough.

522
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,335
La Quica isn't answering, boss.

523
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,421
Hmm.

524
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,217
Okay.

525
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,097
Go start the car.
I'll be there in a second.

526
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,682
Yes, sir.

527
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:34,022
Where is the staging point for this raid?

528
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,108
Where's the staging area?

529
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:39,695
You want me to hand you information,
just like that?

530
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,113
Free?

531
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,699
No, brother.

532
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:44,992
I want a deal.

533
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:49,538
Then give us Pablo... asshole.

534
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,374
I want something different.

535
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:56,295
I want to start a new life,
in the United States of America.

536
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:59,756
He says he wants
a new life in the US of A.

537
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,845
You give us Pablo Escobar,
and I'll take you there myself.

538
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,729
We don't have time for bullshit.

539
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,981
Blackie already rolled on all of you.

540
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,989
If you don't give us something fast,
of substance,

541
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:29,870
we'll buy you that ticket
to the United States... but extradited.

542
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,290
- Extradition doesn't exist.
- Fine, then a jail cell here.

543
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:37,586
With a sign that says "snitch"
around your neck.

544
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,347
The narcos always talk about loyalty...

545
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,599
till their own asses are on the line.

546
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,210
Quica.

547
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,672
Hello. Where are you, boss?

548
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,091
I'm en route, and you?

549
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,051
Me too. I'm not too far off.

550
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:35,978
I'm almost there, boss.
Are you still far off?

551
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,318
Pass the phone to Ricardo.

552
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:49,116
Boss, Ricardo went to get one last stash.

553
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,784
He's on his way.

554
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,539
You want me to meet you?
Are you with Limón?

555
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,215
Yes, we're almost there.

556
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:21,148
You have what you wanted.
He'll be there soon. Limón is driving.

557
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,569
Now give us the staging point.

558
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,823
Pull over.

559
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,457
Give me a moment.

560
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,666
Okay.

561
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,250
Sure, boss.

562
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,842
Tata.

563
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:53,930
Yes, my love?

564
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:58,769
I just want you to know...
that I love you very much.

565
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:01,688
You and our children.

566
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:08,070
You may not hear from me for a while.

567
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,530
What's happening, Pablo?

568
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,075
What are you going to do?

569
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,245
Something I have to do.

570
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:26,338
But you know that I will never,
never leave you, right?

571
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,675
I know.

572
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,766
I love you, Tata.

573
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,690
I will always love you, Pablo.

574
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:09,506
Keep going down that road.
I'll show you the way.

575
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,632
Yes, boss.

576
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,061
Fuck.

577
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,900
I've got something.

578
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,694
Attention all units.
A vehicle is approaching. Be alert.

579
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,696
There you are, motherfucker.

580
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,886
Hey, girls.

581
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,016
Negative. They're whores.

582
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,564
It's after nine.
He's not showing up. He's fucking onto us.

583
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,417
All right. Let the women through.

584
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,027
Stand by, everyone.
This isn't happening tonight.

585
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,696
Goddammit.
Almost fucking had him again.

586
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,616
- Oh, fuck this!
- Peña, goddammit!

587
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,077
Fire! Let's go! Fire!

588
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,606
What will happen with Quica, boss?

589
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,863
Quica is gone, Limón.

590
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,034
They're all gone.
