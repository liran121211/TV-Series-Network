1
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,446
Tata.

2
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,379
Tata. Where is everyone?

3
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,563
Pablo.

4
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,320
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

5
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,863
I'm all right.

6
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,492
Go back to bed.

7
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,360
Do you know why they brought you there?

8
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,572
He said they were going to send a message
to other kids.

9
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,534
Who is "he"? Do you remember his name?

10
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,287
Colonel Carrillo.

11
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,291
I know this is difficult...

12
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,836
but tell me what happened
when they brought you there.

13
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,258
They killed my friend.

14
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,677
- I'm very sorry...
- This is a farce.

15
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,180
- Escobar trained this kid very well.
- I'll speak with Carrillo.

16
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,808
Whether he did or didn't do it
is beside the point.

17
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,394
Colombia is tired of Escobar.

18
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,021
Besides, Valeria Velez?

19
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,440
My God, she has no credibility
in this country.

20
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,943
I need to know if Carrillo
killed that boy.

21
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:43,199
If we say that she's doing this
to discredit Carrillo, they'll believe us.

22
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,787
But if the press finds out
that you spoke to Carrillo about this...

23
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,706
They'll assume it's the truth.

24
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,791
Exactly.

25
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,759
What do you propose?

26
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,512
That we don't play Escobar's game.

27
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:08,016
And that we leave things as they are...
for the time being.

28
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,981
I think we're going to need
more than an interview.

29
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:19,110
- No, no, no. No violence.
- That's not what I mean. I suggest...

30
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,529
Now we need to have the people
on our side.

31
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:27,201
Yes, of course. It's just the president
has denied it ever happened,

32
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,204
and the American news
hasn't even picked up the story.

33
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,789
Of course.

34
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:36,753
If David were the son
of an important politician, but...

35
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:42,383
the men of always aren't interested
in the children of never.

36
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,303
- Of course.
- Right?

37
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,102
Hmm.

38
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,189
Hmm.

39
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,819
I'm writing a letter to the editors
of the most important newspapers

40
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:06,407
to tell them how that boy came to me,
scared for his life.

41
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:11,120
The world has to know what sort of monster
that son of a bitch Carrillo is.

42
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,499
Don Pablo, that's excellent.

43
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,586
Give me that pencil.

44
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,384
When Pablo Escobar starts believing

45
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,680
the pen's mightier than the sword...
you know you're getting to him.

46
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,856
Carrillo's attacks on Pablo's facilities
in Medellín were putting him

47
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,420
- under more and more pressure.
- Burn everything.

48
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,530
The way Carrillo saw it...

49
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:50,284
...each sicario we took out
got us one step closer to Escobar.

50
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,082
Don't move! Felix, take this one.

51
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,501
Don't even think about it.
Up against the wall.

52
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,800
While everyone could agree
it felt good emptying Pablo's pockets...

53
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,136
We don't know yet. We're working on it.

54
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,307
...they weren't all sold on the method.

55
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,395
Is it true?

56
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,149
- Not to my knowledge.
- Don't play word games with me.

57
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,235
If that kid's telling the truth,
Peña and Murphy were there.

58
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,654
They're the only Americans
that asshole trusts.

59
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,450
I find it hard to believe that Colonel
Carrillo would want American witnesses.

60
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,160
Exactly what he wants.

61
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,788
Guarantees they won't say shit if people
start asking questions. And guess what?

62
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,082
People are asking questions.

63
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,297
Look, if Carrillo wants
to walk out in the streets

64
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,925
and gun down every sicario in Medellín,
God bless him.

65
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:53,181
But our guys can't be there
when he does it. Understood?

66
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,808
Understood.

67
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,853
It's been quiet for about a week.
Nothing of significance.

68
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,607
But a phone we connected to Edgar Prisco
popped up three times last night.

69
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,568
All within Manrique,
the same three-block vicinity here.

70
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,446
They just can't fucking help themselves,
can they?

71
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,283
My men did a drive-by early this morning
and identified a potential location.

72
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,827
Right here. The pool hall.

73
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,141
Are we having a good time?

74
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,945
That's a very pretty girl. But you're
paying for those lines, asshole.

75
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,662
Clean this shit up!

76
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,124
Who taught you to live like this?
Not from our mother!

77
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:10,341
Wake up, asshole! And you, Edgar!

78
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:14,971
Call Pablo and ask him
where he wants us to take his half.

79
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,265
All right. All right.

80
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,726
What are you doing calling
from that phone? Use the pay phone!

81
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,063
- Relax, brother.
- Edgar...

82
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,523
What?

83
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,526
- Have you been calling from this phone?
- No.

84
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,112
Son of a...

85
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,099
Move it, faggot!

86
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,652
Where you going?

87
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,626
Hey, there.

88
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,641
Murphy! Not a good neighborhood
to get yourself lost in, eh?

89
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,517
Fuck.

90
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,005
Shh, shh, shh.

91
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,092
Dad.

92
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,804
- Quickly, inside.
- Friend.

93
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,473
Calm down, friend.

94
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,729
Everything is all right.

95
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,607
Fuck.

96
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,403
Murphy! Gavera 37!
You need to get up here!

97
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,617
Murphy, get in the car.

98
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,789
The fuck were you thinking?

99
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,174
This fucking close.

100
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,470
We were definitely getting closer.

101
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,431
And so who could blame
the "Gentlemen of Cali"

102
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:49,393
for starting to think about a future
without Pablo Escobar?

103
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,649
I can't believe it. You son of a bitch.

104
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,234
It's carbon rock.

105
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,905
The cocaine is dissolved and mixed in.

106
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:05,117
Did you think I bought chemistry labs
because I enjoyed the class in school?

107
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,953
You're going
to put chemists out of business.

108
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,081
I'm more interested
in putting Pablo out of business.

109
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,336
Now's the time to move in on Miami.

110
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,174
It won't be hard for us
to take that business.

111
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,221
- But don't you think it's too early?
- Pablo's in hiding.

112
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,141
The Search Bloc is killing his men.
Soon they'll catch him,

113
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,561
and I want us to be in an advantageous
position when that happens.

114
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,688
Could you take care of that?

115
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,316
Yes, of course.

116
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,612
But don't make it too obvious.

117
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:47,576
I don't want Judy Moncada asking fucking
questions and negotiating for a piece.

118
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,204
Then you should call Pablo

119
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:55,709
and tell him we'd be happy
to turn Judy over to him.

120
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,671
We'll dump her in the same ditch
we'll be dumping him in.

121
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:15,854
Guys.

122
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,569
The Search Bloc took another Moncada lab.

123
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,280
The sons of bitches killed
three of the Prisco brothers.

124
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,865
Ricardo got away.

125
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,783
- When was this?
- Last night.

126
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,746
It's that son of a bitch, Don Berna.
He's telling the cops everything.

127
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,416
Let's hide out on the coast.
I'll convince Don Pablo.

128
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,419
Since when do we hide, brother? Huh?

129
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,839
Let's trust the boss.

130
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,342
Yes. Don Pablo always finds a solution.

131
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,977
- Hello? Who is this?
- Get me Don Pablo. Fernando Duque.

132
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,395
- Fernando.
- Get him now.

133
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,940
Yes, sir, right away. Limón, please.

134
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,074
Boss?

135
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,911
Your lawyer, Mr. Duque.

136
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,167
- How many were published?
- Don Pablo,

137
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,879
we sent all of them to the newspapers.

138
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,760
How many of my letters were published,
Fernando?

139
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,220
Yes. Uh, none.

140
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,806
They're very, very well written.

141
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:39,271
It's not about how well written they were,
Fernando. It was the fucking truth!

142
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,414
If it seemed like Escobar's world
was crashing down around him,

143
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,541
it was actually about to get worse.

144
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,254
Remember when Pablo collaborated
with M-19 communists

145
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,548
during the Palace of Justice siege?

146
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,803
By doing that,
he pissed off the Autodefensas...

147
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,931
an extreme right-wing paramilitary group

148
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,767
that was in direct conflict
with the communist guerrillas.

149
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,105
This is why
we saw ourselves forced to take up arms

150
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,690
and defend ourselves...

151
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:26,193
The leaders of the Autodefensas
were the Castaño brothers:

152
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,861
Fidel and Carlos.

153
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,364
Carlos is the one
barking orders at people.

154
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,534
In the late 70s, their father, Jesús,

155
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:37,079
a prominent landowner,
was kidnapped by the FARC guerrillas

156
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,290
who demanded 50 million pesos
for his ransom.

157
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,377
But his sons were
only able to come up with 16.

158
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,880
Well, that didn't cut it.

159
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,633
So the guerrillas
beat the elder Castaño to death.

160
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,388
From that day forward, the right-wing,

161
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,100
psychopathic, commie-killing
Castaño brothers

162
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,978
swore never to rest
until their father was avenged...

163
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:07,651
...and every last guerrilla
driven from the countryside was killed.

164
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,072
Move it, you sons of bitches!

165
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:17,619
Even innocent villagers
who simply lived in guerrilla strongholds

166
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,165
were put to death because
they lived under communist subjugation.

167
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,756
And in their efforts to wipe out
the communist guerrillas...

168
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,636
the Castaños caught the attention
of some like-minded friends.

169
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,682
- Mr. Stechner.
- Good to see you, my friend.

170
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,935
- Welcome. Have a nice trip?
- Thank you. As always, as always.

171
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,897
All right. Very good.

172
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,360
These weapons
are better than the last ones.

173
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,278
They should be.

174
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,573
Thank you, Mr. Green,
for the continued support of your country.

175
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,285
I haven't used that name
since the School of the Americas.

176
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,456
I know you're waging a great war
against communism in these jungles.

177
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:06,085
We will not stop
until the last communist is dead.

178
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,795
Another struggle is emerging.

179
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:14,218
One that is essential to our, uh...
shared cause.

180
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,386
Escobar.

181
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,806
Escobar deserves to die.

182
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:23,519
But our fight is here in the jungle,
against the guerrilla.

183
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,980
Yes, and Pablo's still strong in Medellín.

184
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,234
Yeah, strength is exceedingly relative.

185
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:41,578
An alliance is forming...
with the objective of taking out Escobar.

186
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,788
Who?

187
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,207
Rival elements from the trafficking world.

188
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,420
Look, what matters most is that
when Escobar's taken off the board,

189
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,466
the right parties are in a position
to make sure order is maintained.

190
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,262
And that strategic Colombian resources
and revenue streams...

191
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,265
don't fall into the wrong hands.

192
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,144
Guys.

193
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,813
Ms. Judy.

194
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:58,697
All right, now... I would like
to know the reason for this meeting.

195
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,534
- You don't see this every day.
- Look, Pacho, it's simple.

196
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,661
We need to get rid of Pablo Escobar.

197
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,917
We know you all joined forces against him.

198
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,921
And we want to know if it's possible
for my brother and I to join the cause.

199
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:18,592
Why? What do you want out of this?

200
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,720
- We want what's best for Colombia.
- That's it?

201
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,182
Pablo Escobar,
aside from being a terrorist,

202
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:30,646
is also allied with the guerrillas,
whom he has helped on many occasions.

203
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,775
Putting an end to Pablo Escobar
is a patriotic act.

204
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,820
Imagine, Pacho, your financial resources

205
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:44,326
combined with all of the information
you have on Pablo Escobar's operation

206
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:49,206
- with our military experience...
- We'd make one hell of a death squad.

207
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:55,462
No, no, no, Mrs. Moncada. No.
A death squad? No. An army.

208
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,714
And when this army gets to Medellín,

209
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,676
Pablo Escobar's death
won't be a matter of months.

210
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,136
It'll be a matter of weeks.

211
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,681
What do you say, Pacho?

212
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,226
Can we count on the support
of you and your partners?

213
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,112
All of this sounds interesting.

214
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,156
With all due respect, gentlemen,

215
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,453
our organization already
has a strategy in place, and it's working.

216
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,248
It doesn't seem to me like it's working.

217
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,626
Because, to this day,
Pablo Escobar is still alive.

218
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,338
- That's right.
- At this rate, not for long.

219
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,014
Look, I'll share this conversation
with our partners.

220
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,851
But I think that, for now,
our answer is no.

221
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,105
Excuse me.

222
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,086
- Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.
- How did you find me?

223
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,047
I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.

224
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,468
- And La Quica?
- He's not here.

225
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,720
He's back there, looking for you.

226
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,518
If he finds out I'm here, he'll want
to kill me too. Let's talk. Relax.

227
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,523
Because of you,
I'll never be able to go back to Medellín.

228
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,941
- Maritza!
- Because of you,

229
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,111
- my daughter and I have to live in hiding.
- Relax, relax, relax!

230
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,950
I really am sorry,
and I'm here because I want to help you.

231
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,703
Like you helped the girls
you used to drive around in your taxi?

232
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,873
- I had nothing to do with that.
- And why would I believe you?

233
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,043
Because you know me,
and I wouldn't do something like that.

234
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,254
You killed me, Jhon.

235
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,341
You killed me by putting me
in your fucking taxi.

236
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:08,929
You knew how badly I needed that money
and you took advantage of that.

237
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,598
I really am sorry, Maritza.

238
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,684
Believe me, I think I have an idea
to get us both out of this.

239
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,769
What is it?

240
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,606
We'll give them what they want.
We'll give them Escobar.

241
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,156
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Believe me, Maritza.

242
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:32,119
I'm the one who drives Escobar.
I know when his sicarios aren't with him.

243
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,955
- You can call the police.
- Maritza, what's going on here?

244
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,833
Mom, go back inside. Go inside.

245
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,796
Doña Liliana.

246
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,049
- I don't trust the police.
- Listen to me.

247
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,594
This is your chance
to get a visa from the Americans,

248
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,721
so you can leave with your daughter.

249
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:01,106
And you?
What do you get out of this?

250
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:05,068
Working for Escobar isn't what it seems.
They're killing all of his men.

251
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,486
I'm afraid.

252
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,993
I need to get out.
We both need to get out, Maritza.

253
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:59,873
All right. My turn.

254
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,708
Mmm.

255
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,461
You both look beautiful.

256
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:14,054
All right, my love, go to your room
so I can talk with your dad, all right?

257
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,032
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

258
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,162
Velasco told me.

259
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,983
There are 20 men out there, Tata.

260
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:13,321
Yes, Pablo... 20 strangers.

261
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,741
Let's see.

262
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,786
How do you hold it?

263
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:37,387
What? Are you sure you want to laugh
at your wife while she's holding a gun?

264
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,309
- It's not a joke, Pablo.
- Tata.

265
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:46,062
Those 20 men out there
don't care what happens to us.

266
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,817
When the time comes,
it will just be you and me.

267
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,031
And I will be a part of this, Pablo.

268
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,125
All right.

269
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,964
But I think you need
more practice with that.

270
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,156
- Javi, it's Gabriela.
- What's up?

271
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,742
- It's been a while and I want to see you.
- Now?

272
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,953
I can't right now. I'm working.

273
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,873
Don't be like that.

274
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:58,385
All right. Give me...
20 minutes, all right?

275
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:02,138
Get the lecture from Messina
about not leaving base?

276
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,223
Yeah.

277
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,684
Crosby must've really laid into her
on that one.

278
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,323
- Where you going?
- Out. Off base.

279
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,661
Okay, I guess it means "Fuck that."

280
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,498
Hello.

281
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,502
- I've got half an hour.
- Wait.

282
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:36,589
- Javi... Javi, Javi...
- Come here. What's wrong?

283
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,052
Hello.

284
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,096
Hi.

285
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,973
She's a friend of a friend.

286
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,268
Maritza, meet Javier.

287
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,438
And...

288
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,817
why are you introducing me
to a friend of a friend?

289
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,653
She's in trouble.

290
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,406
Just hear her out.

291
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,701
Goddammit, Gabby.
You could have told me over the phone, no?

292
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,828
- I knew you wouldn't come.
- Well, I'm leaving.

293
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,747
- Bye!
- No, no, no.

294
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,624
Wait. It's important.

295
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,002
Please.

296
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,421
Hear her out.

297
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,348
What's your name? Maritza?

298
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,441
What kind of trouble are you in?

299
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,486
Who are you in trouble with?

300
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,241
- La Quica.
- La Quica. You know La Quica?

301
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,331
- He wants to kill me.
- Well...

302
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,666
La Quica wants to kill a lot of people.

303
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,588
Why does he want to kill you?

304
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,592
Because I can tell you
where Pablo Escobar is.

305
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,727
And how are you going to do that?

306
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:17,106
I know exactly when and where
he'll be tomorrow.

307
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,698
Her name is Maritza Rincón.

308
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,952
She works at the market across from
the brothel where the girls were killed.

309
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,329
Where we almost had La Quica
and the other guy...

310
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,041
Jhon Burgos. Goes by "Limón."

311
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:39,087
He used to drive the girls around until
La Quica made him Escobar's chauffeur.

312
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,049
This girl Maritza was actually
in the back seat serving as a cover

313
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,051
while Escobar was in the fucking trunk.

314
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,887
- And he knows her how?
- They grew up together here.

315
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,019
So this guy Limón,
there's no record of him.

316
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,939
There's no known connection
between him and Escobar,

317
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,983
yet somehow he ends up the driver.

318
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:03,278
Makes sense for La Quica to hire someone
the police didn't know about.

319
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,655
What does she want out of this?
A ticket to Disneyland?

320
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,199
She knows she doesn't get shit
if it doesn't pan out.

321
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:13,705
If this is true, she can tell
us when Limón and Escobar go somewhere.

322
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,919
You were there. You trust her?

323
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:23,922
Yeah.

324
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,467
Yeah, I do.

325
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,104
When we get the location, I want
Centra Spike up in the air to confirm.

326
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,355
Let's go.

327
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,236
- All right. This is good.
- Let's go.

328
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,744
Can you explain this?

329
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,874
A subpoena.

330
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:01,920
You're going to answer the questions
I have regarding La Catedral.

331
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,089
You mean your witch hunt.

332
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,844
Tell me, how did Pablo Escobar
get out of that prison

333
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:14,474
while being surrounded by 400 soldiers?

334
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,228
How many times do I have to tell you
that I don't know how Escobar escaped?

335
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,565
He must have paid someone off.

336
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,611
I would say that's
almost certainly the case.

337
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:34,243
This is about transparency, truth, law.

338
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:39,666
And I sense from your reluctance to speak

339
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:44,629
that the truth will not be kind to you
or our esteemed president.

340
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:52,679
Look, sir, what happened that night
was complicated and, yes,

341
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,391
I must confess that we lost control
of the situation, we made mistakes,

342
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,727
but we're talking about a national crisis.

343
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:06,275
So what? Does that mean
that we should just trust you?

344
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:12,115
Look, sir...
I ask you to please trust me.

345
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,453
All you're doing by making
this investigation public

346
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:23,167
is destroying the life of a very good
human being. Our president.

347
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:28,214
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

348
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,563
Hello?

349
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,523
Hello, Maritza. It's me.

350
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,902
- I spoke with Peña.
- Pay attention.

351
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,449
In one hour, I will take Pablo
to his accountant.

352
00:33:55,867 --> 00:34:00,872
He lives in the south. I need you to give
the Americans the address. Understand?

353
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,168
Are we really going to turn in
Pablo Escobar?

354
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:10,757
Yes, Maritza.
We're going to do this together.

355
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,177
But I need you to trust me.

356
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,847
Give me the address.

357
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,724
Write it down.

358
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:25,063
9th street with 98-3. Got it?

359
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,859
Got it.

360
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:45,583
...my love. Do it again.

361
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,045
I'm sorry, boss.
You'll be late to your appointment.

362
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,172
Thank you, Limón. A kiss.

363
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:55,593
Come on. Ice cream. Ice cream.
One, two, and...

364
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,542
Everything all right, boss?

365
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:26,808
Peña.

366
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:31,314
9th Street. 98-3.

367
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,566
Okay. Got it.

368
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,072
I need to know
if there's activity around this address.

369
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,533
You get a match on a voice,
you find me immediately.

370
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,118
Okay. You got it.

371
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,443
- This was recorded about five minutes ago.
- You can barely hear it.

372
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,518
Let me clean it up.

373
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:17,652
All right.
Now turn off the satellite phones.

374
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,445
- That's Pablo.
- We have to move now.

375
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,656
- Yeah.
- You two are staying here.

376
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,658
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

377
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,535
Crosby finds out you went on another raid,
we all get a ticket home.

378
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,205
Crosby doesn't have to know shit.

379
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,623
It's not negotiable.

380
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,337
We'll be in radio contact.

381
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,174
Jesus.

382
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:54,188
We'll be out in 20 minutes.
So be on alert.

383
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,606
Yes, Colonel.

384
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,943
Attention! We're headed out!

385
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,307
We're on San Juan.

386
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,018
Copy that. Watch your six, guys.

387
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,687
How's it looking out there?

388
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,358
Everything's calm.
Murphy, you're buying the drinks tonight.

389
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,236
Cheap bastards.

390
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,032
Don't forget to pick me and Peña up
some cigars on the way.

391
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,284
Of course, blondie.

392
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,716
Reverse!

393
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,260
Look above!

394
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,430
It's an ambush!

395
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,727
Sabada!

396
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,230
Carrillo, respond!
Carrillo! Trujillo! Do you copy?

397
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,404
Son of a bitch!

398
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,115
Goddamn it, speak to me!
We need people there.

399
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,200
Carrillo!

400
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,421
Go, go, go! Come on!

401
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,968
Fuck!

402
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,048
Look at me.

403
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,012
Look at me.

404
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:48,195
You asked a child to give me this.

405
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,877
You can have it back.

406
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,426
And this...

407
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,930
is for my cousin, Gustavo.

408
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,601
Coward.

409
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,186
Son of a bitch.

410
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,511
Don't worry. It's going to heal well.

411
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,350
I'll go back to Bogotá
with the body until the funeral.

412
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,020
They call his wife?

413
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,147
Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.

414
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,570
This ain't on you, Javi. It's on Escobar.

415
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,989
And one way or another, he pays.

416
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,785
We all do. Right?

417
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,338
This isn't your fault, Peña.

418
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,798
- No?
- No.

419
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,098
- I got played.
- We all got played.

420
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,101
We all had the information,
it was backed up by Centra Spike...

421
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,227
Stop.

422
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,939
Just...

423
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,362
You know, you coming here...

424
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,450
you say all the right things.

425
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,831
Doesn't make a damn bit of difference.

426
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:37,591
Colonel Carrillo's funeral
will be tomorrow.

427
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,597
I don't do funerals.

428
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:09,308
They're saying
that Pablo himself killed Carrillo.

429
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,351
Next, he'll come after the two of you.

430
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,982
Or me, or you, Pacho.

431
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:20,068
No, no.
We've got to come up with another plan.

432
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,447
Another approach.
Another way to achieve our goals.

433
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,702
Pacho, we need to call the Castaños.

434
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,624
Soon we'll know what's in it for them.

435
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:10,911
Carrillo hasn't been buried yet...
and they're already asking for my head.

436
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,790
They want a scapegoat.

437
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,293
And we have to give them one.

438
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,431
That's why we're going to say that you
were poorly advised by your vice minister.

439
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,854
- We can find another way.
- Let me finish.

440
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,900
We're going to say that I acted alone
and without authorization

441
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,027
when I entered La Catedral.

442
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:48,907
And that it was I who insisted
that Carrillo return.

443
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,888
I don't accept your resignation.

444
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:02,421
Now, more than ever, the country
needs you, Eduardo. I need you.

445
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:05,007
We have to do it, César.

446
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:11,763
You know it. The attorney general,
the press, the opposition, the citizens,

447
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,808
everyone's looking for someone to blame.
All of them.

448
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,436
And it's not going to be you.

449
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:29,114
It's been my honor serving you
and the people of Colombia.

450
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,507
Good luck.

451
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,624
Limón told me you have a daughter.

452
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,586
How old?

453
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,301
- Two.
- And what's her name?

454
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:19,141
- Salome.
- What a beautiful name.

455
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,527
This is the second time
that I've felt indebted to you.

456
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:40,328
Now, Maritza...
our daughters will be safe.

457
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,582
Thank you.

458
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:50,422
Know that... you have a friend in me.

459
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,897
What did you do?

460
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,485
I took care of it.

461
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,488
You're safe now.

462
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,531
Limón.

463
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,798
Hey.

464
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,760
What are you doing here?

465
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,100
Where's Olivia?

466
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:28,144
She's at home. With my sister.

467
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,407
Hey, you okay?

468
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,417
Hey.

469
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,988
What now?

470
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,449
What the fuck do you want?

471
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,993
I want to help you.

472
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,163
Oh, yeah?

473
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,459
Come with me and I'll show you.

474
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,055
Make yourself at home.

475
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,835
Agent Peña.

476
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,754
Welcome to Montecasino.
