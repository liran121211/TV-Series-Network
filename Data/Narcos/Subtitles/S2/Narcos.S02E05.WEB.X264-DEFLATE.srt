1
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:40,040
I'm sure you recognize
some of these people, right? Agent Peña?

2
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,128
It looks like you raided
the family album...

3
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,006
Mrs. Moncada.

4
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,383
Please, call me Judy.

5
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,470
Let me tell you...

6
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,348
before this son of a bitch
killed my husband and my brother,

7
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,351
all these people were my friends.
What do you think of that?

8
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,898
Well, it looks to me
like you made some new friends. No?

9
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,736
We might say that we share a common goal.

10
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,532
- The same as yours, Agent Peña.
- Is that right?

11
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,451
Yes.

12
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,123
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

13
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,501
Wait, Javier.

14
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,630
I'd like you to listen
to what we have to say.

15
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:33,009
You want to catch Escobar,
just like we do.

16
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,970
But let's not lie to ourselves.

17
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,432
You haven't been able to get close to him.

18
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:44,813
The only play you had to get to him
was using Carrillo.

19
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,649
And we know how that ended, right?

20
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:52,695
So, you're taking a break
from burning down villages?

21
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,742
What we do is fill in
for an absent government.

22
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:02,705
We're going to kill everyone
close to Escobar one by one.

23
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,459
Until he's alone. With nothing.

24
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,213
What we want, Mr. Peña,

25
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:14,050
is to make Escobar understand
he is not untouchable.

26
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,969
We want him to be afraid.

27
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,429
There's just one small problem.

28
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,807
Just one?

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:28,022
To catch him, we need the satellite
technology and surveillance

30
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,108
that your government has, Agent Peña.

31
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,696
And I'm just going to...
hand that over to you?

32
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,199
We have been partners for a while now,
Agent Peña.

33
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,786
All the information that he gave to you,
I gave to him.

34
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:48,209
We are simply making...
a small adjustment.

35
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,974
Thanks for the drink.

36
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,747
Too much stupidity for my liking.

37
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,376
The Castaños can be useful.

38
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,129
I was talking about you.

39
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,300
Yes, Javier.

40
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,011
I'm a narco.

41
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,640
And I believe in honor and loyalty,
like you.

42
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,060
Pablo doesn't.

43
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,146
Berna. Go get the car.

44
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,160
Are you going to give me a cigarette
or what?

45
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,633
Mmm.

46
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,345
Well...

47
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,351
we really want you to realize, Agent Peña,

48
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:32,105
the potential of what we're offering you.
Mmm?

49
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,945
Because, well...
with all the information in the world,

50
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,197
you still have to be a policeman, right?

51
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,122
I know what it feels like
when Pablo kills someone close to you.

52
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,917
What's that?

53
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,796
Information that would be
very valuable to you.

54
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,049
That was very easy for us to find.
Take it.

55
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:09,684
She's staying with a friend.
That little girl, Maritza.

56
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,021
The woman that betrayed you
and got Carrillo killed.

57
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,522
You'll find her there.

58
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,821
I told you we have an enemy in common.

59
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,665
If you change your mind, give us a ring.

60
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,864
Life goes on, right?

61
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,743
And for Escobar,
that was a pretty good thing.

62
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,539
He remained at large,
protected by an army of sicarios...

63
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,084
in a city that refused to give him up.

64
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,796
Pablo kept his lawyers working overtime...

65
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:49,427
continuing to negotiate his surrender
with Colombian Attorney General De Greiff.

66
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,221
But it was bullshit.

67
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,057
Why surrender when
you're holding all the cards?

68
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,145
He was free. And business was booming.

69
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,771
LEADER OF THE SEARCH BLOC KILLED

70
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,649
For those of us tasked
with catching Escobar,

71
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,735
Carrillo's death was a punch in the gut.

72
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,906
But life went on for us as well.

73
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,784
Centra Spike was still busy
gathering intel.

74
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,372
The brass was still
reviewing and approving it.

75
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,709
And it was still finding its way to us.

76
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,670
But, shit, man...

77
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,758
you can have all the intelligence
in the world,

78
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,011
but if nobody's there to act on it,
what's it worth?

79
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,806
Nothing.

80
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:42,021
All it adds up to
is a growing stack of unread files

81
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,981
on a dead man's desk.

82
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,110
We were back where we started: nowhere.

83
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,155
Look, Dad.

84
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,281
Let's see.

85
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,415
- Nine point seven.
- Why?

86
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,503
I would've given you a ten,
but here, next to me,

87
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:09,840
is an Argentinian judge who's very picky.

88
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,302
Very picky.

89
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,222
Why don't you jump in here with me?

90
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,392
If I dive in there,
I'd splash all the water out of the pool.

91
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,566
Sir, Fernando Duque is here.

92
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,695
And you...
And what are you doing, my little love?

93
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,532
That's it. Little kicks, little kicks.
Like a little pair of scissors.

94
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,576
That's right, like a little puppy.

95
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,160
That's it, beautiful.

96
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,830
Hey, ladies.

97
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,460
My kids are in the pool.
Does someone know how to swim?

98
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,797
- Yeah, boss, they call me "Flipper."
- Flipper?

99
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,010
You talk so much shit, Blackie. You'd sink
like a rock tied to a heavier rock.

100
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,428
Eat shit, Velasco.

101
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,888
- Velasco, I'm putting my trust in you.
- Yes, sir.

102
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,140
Not in Flipper.

103
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,809
Flipper.

104
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,896
"They call me Flipper."

105
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,778
- What's the score?
- Two to zero.

106
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,072
The National team is winning.
We're killing them!

107
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,907
That's it!

108
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:37,136
Careful with that little dance.
You're starting to put ideas in my head.

109
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,389
Love, who is picking up Carlos?

110
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,476
La Quica. He's on his way.

111
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,313
Hey, that smells good.

112
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:51,651
Pablo, the kids love this place.

113
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,736
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

114
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,672
On your feet. Now!

115
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:19,095
I didn't know. I didn't know, I swear.
Limón lied to me.

116
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,933
No, please. When they find me,
they're going to kill me.

117
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,768
- No! No!
- Stay still!

118
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,937
Please.

119
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,149
Do you think I wanted this?

120
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,736
They used me
and they're throwing my life away.

121
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,739
You're breaking my fucking heart, baby.

122
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,370
You're all the same.

123
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,415
You don't listen. Nobody listens!

124
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,835
And all those people dying for no reason.

125
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,050
What's up, Peña?
What should we do with her?

126
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,642
She's good with kids.

127
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,358
I'm so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Carrillo.

128
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,286
I keep wondering
if it's better to know the truth.

129
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,998
I don't follow.

130
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:35,296
The things they said about my husband,
about what he did before he was killed.

131
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,382
Did he shoot a child?

132
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,262
Did he kill that boy
like they said on the news?

133
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,434
No. Absolutely not.

134
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:55,399
Your husband did everything in his means
to get Escobar.

135
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,777
But he did not cross the line.

136
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,829
Well, that was rough.

137
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,253
- I just kept looking at her, thinking...
- Hey.

138
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,841
It's not gonna happen to me,
it's not gonna happen to us.

139
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,221
You want me to come home?

140
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,854
Just make sure you're still you
when it's all over.

141
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,323
So three years in the jungles
fighting FARC.

142
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:49,620
Hugo Martinez chose his own path
a long time ago

143
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,872
and he hasn't deviated from it since.

144
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:57,419
He's methodical, favors procedure
and strict protocol.

145
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,255
Do you think you can get him to do it?

146
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:06,262
How do you get a man to take a job
that nobody wants? Don't get me wrong.

147
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,598
There was no shortage of brave men
in the Colombian National Police.

148
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,769
But signing up to replace Carrillo
as the head of the Search Bloc

149
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,063
would take a lot more than bravery.

150
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,650
Gaviria couldn't count on someone
raising their hand.

151
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:23,779
It would take a certain kind of pressure
to find the right volunteer.

152
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,656
Is that your father?

153
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,783
Over there with the president?

154
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,415
That's cool.

155
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:48,304
To all those present,
it is my honor to present

156
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,640
the President of the Republic...

157
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,522
His Excellency,
Don César Augusto Gaviria Trujillo.

158
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,366
Congratulations, Class of 1992.

159
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,620
Recent events...

160
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,124
contrast heavily with today's ceremony.

161
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:24,381
Each one of you has decided to sacrifice
your personal interests...

162
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:30,054
and dedicate your lives
to the service of the nation.

163
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,142
There is no higher honor...

164
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,313
than to serve your homeland.

165
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,032
- Colonel, how are you doing?
- Very well.

166
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,493
I enjoyed your speech very much,
Mr. President.

167
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,870
I'm glad. It was also for you.

168
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:02,252
Look, Colonel, in the last 24 hours,
I've been discussing with my advisors

169
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,047
who should be at the head
of the Search Bloc.

170
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,008
They mentioned many names.

171
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,553
But I would like it to be you,
Colonel Martinez.

172
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,684
That's an honor, Mr. President,
but at this point in my career,

173
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:21,939
- I'm sure you can find a better candidate.
- Colombia wants to end this nightmare.

174
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,651
And I know you're the man to do it.

175
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,321
The nation deserves someone
better than me.

176
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:36,370
Your son was one of the best
in the academy. He's an excellent cadet.

177
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,747
He worked very hard.
I'm very proud of him.

178
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,712
We asked the best in the class
to join the Search Bloc.

179
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,840
And your son happily accepted.

180
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,053
I ask that you at least
consider my request.

181
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,724
For Colombia.

182
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,951
- Carlos!
- Tata!

183
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,292
Come on, come on. Let's see.

184
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,544
Go ahead.

185
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:29,089
- I can't believe it. Look at you.
- Slowly, slowly.

186
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,800
I don't want any more visits
to the doctor.

187
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,888
- Manuela, you're so beautiful. Look at me.
- Look how tan he is.

188
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,724
He looks like a movie star, right?

189
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,975
Yes, boss.

190
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,061
- He looks like Tom Cruise.
- Well...

191
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,353
Look at her, Pablo.

192
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,315
I can't believe you brought me from Miami
to see my sister like this.

193
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,568
No. I'm just so happy to see you.

194
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,822
Oh, my God. Carlos!

195
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,744
Welcome, sweetie.
I'm so happy to have you home.

196
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,581
Tonight, I am going to make
the best meal this family has ever had.

197
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,710
Well, then...
ready to go for a little walk?

198
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,839
It's incredible how much
the children have grown, Pablo.

199
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,717
Manuelita is a princess. She is beautiful.

200
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,721
She's the one who controls everything
around here. I just pay the bills.

201
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,808
I heard about Carrillo.

202
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:25,229
If that son of a bitch was still alive,
many more policemen would have died.

203
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:29,274
I did the police a favor. Believe me.

204
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,277
Do you think the police agree with you?

205
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:36,657
No one wants war, Carlos.
Especially when they know they would lose.

206
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,326
But all that's in the past.

207
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:45,791
And I'm ready to get back to business.
I'm all in.

208
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,294
- Tell me about Miami.
- What can I tell you, Pablo?

209
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:53,090
The demand keeps increasing
and the merchandise keeps on coming.

210
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,093
Business hasn't been affected
by what happened at La Catedral,

211
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,803
nor by what you did.

212
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,599
Well, business can always
get better, right?

213
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,019
Business was pretty good.

214
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,898
And a large part of that
was due to a guy they called the Lion.

215
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,317
You might remember him
as a Medellín hustler

216
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:17,364
who used to stuff bricks of cocaine into
his jacket and smuggle them into Miami.

217
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:22,452
Well, he stayed in Miami
and he made it his town.

218
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,499
He was responsible for a smuggling network

219
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,378
that brought in Pablo's cocaine
by the ton. He was great at it.

220
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,924
But getting cocaine into the States
wasn't really the problem.

221
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,928
The problem was,
what do you do with all that money?

222
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:44,766
Sure, some of it could stay in the States.
And the narcos did that.

223
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,396
They bought crooked banks,
real estate, car dealerships,

224
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,982
race horses, art, you name it.

225
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:57,529
But if you're gonna run a cocaine empire,
you need to have a lot of cash on hand.

226
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,866
And getting cash back into Colombia
wasn't easy.

227
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,577
Let me put it this way:

228
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,205
This is what a ton of cocaine looks like.

229
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:12,336
And here's what the same ton of cocaine
looks like when it's converted into cash.

230
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,462
See the problem?

231
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,966
Lion had to be creative
with how he got that money to Pablo.

232
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,346
And he was.
His shipments showed up like clockwork.

233
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,227
But the deeper Pablo went into his war
with the government...

234
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,272
the more important these shipments were.

235
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,525
Pablo needed more money than ever.

236
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,153
Without it, he was fucked.

237
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,406
Let's bring the Lion over here.

238
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,786
I want to speak to him face to face,
like the old days.

239
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,497
- Okay.
- Make some new arrangements.

240
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,290
Some better ones.

241
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,334
Quica.

242
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,464
Give Velasco a call.
Tell him to find the Lion.

243
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:00,008
Carlos and I want to speak to him
about business.

244
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,431
It's time to get back
to making money, brother.

245
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,892
- Like the good old days, Pablo.
- Exactly.

246
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,906
What's up, Maritza?

247
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,367
What happened?

248
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:31,999
The police are looking for me.
They want to put a bullet in my head.

249
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,919
I'm sorry, Maritza. I thought
something good would come from all this.

250
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,462
Something good?

251
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,219
Let me come work with you.

252
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,888
No, Maritza, you're crazy.

253
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,643
I have to get this.

254
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,061
Give me one second.

255
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,566
What's up?

256
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:02,070
Where the fuck are you, Limón? Think you
can make me wait around for you, bitch?

257
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,281
I'm close by, man.

258
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:07,868
I mean, there's a lot of goddamn traffic,
but I'm on my way.

259
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,663
I don't give a fuck if there's traffic.
I need you here now!

260
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,459
You have to take this shit with you,
so get your ass over here. Right now.

261
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:19,379
Yes, I know, I know.
Forgive me. I'm on my way.

262
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,811
Maritza, I have to go.
I can't help you right now.

263
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,981
We already gave you money.
I'll call you later.

264
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,151
And we'll figure it out,
but I can't right now.

265
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,614
Okay, here we go.

266
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:03,275
- Search Bloc.
- It's Peña.

267
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:07,070
I'm here with Trujillo at the corner
of 38th and 24th streets. We need back up.

268
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,573
Sorry, but there's no authorization
to dispatch patrols.

269
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:14,077
We're watching one of Escobar's guys.
He just entered the building.

270
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,956
Return to base with the location.
We can ask for authorization from Bogotá.

271
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,333
Sure.

272
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,545
And you'll show up next Tuesday,
son of a bitch.

273
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,594
What time were you supposed to be here,
asshole?

274
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:34,014
You knew you had to make the delivery
before I pick up Lion tomorrow.

275
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,600
No, brother, don't get mad.
It's just that...

276
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,934
Limón!

277
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:42,189
You're going to take this goddamn bag
and get out of here now! I'm watching you.

278
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,982
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

279
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,360
This is the last time you pull shit
like this, Limón. The last time!

280
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,325
- This is the last time you make me wait.
- Come on, man...

281
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,661
- I told you. Get out of here.
- Oh, shit. That's Velasco.

282
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,623
Shit. What do we do?

283
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,334
We stick with Velasco.
The other one doesn't matter.

284
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,338
How many guys
do you think are inside, Peña?

285
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,591
Too many for just us two, no?

286
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,510
Yeah. We'd be screwed.

287
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:17,182
Son of a bitch.
We should call for backup, right?

288
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,191
Who are you calling?

289
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,717
- What's going on, Peña?
- I'll handle this.

290
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,942
This is Trujillo. You can trust him.

291
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,612
You're finally seeing the light.

292
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,283
Let's just see if this works.

293
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,828
You two coming?

294
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,876
Okay, then. You two, in the front with me.

295
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,963
Berna, with his men, around back.
Understood?

296
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,883
Just stay clear of the windows.

297
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,094
- Let's go, then.
- Let's move.

298
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,847
- They're everywhere.
- Let's go down.

299
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,163
Hey!

300
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,471
Where were you going,
you filthy son of a bitch? Huh?

301
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,153
Here it is, Mrs. Escobar.

302
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,324
- What's that?
- It's a delivery.

303
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,993
- But who told you to buy this?
- It was me.

304
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,913
It's some clothes.

305
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,081
Hermilda.

306
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,170
Hermilda, for God's sake...
you can't send him out with so much money.

307
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,839
- Oh, Tata!
- They are going to know where we are.

308
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,966
You worry too much.

309
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:07,263
It's going to affect the children. Do you
want Juan Pablo and Manuela to worry?

310
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,894
You're right.

311
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,108
When Pablo was a little boy...

312
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,156
he came home from school one day,
very angry.

313
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,537
A little girl made fun of his shoes.

314
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,123
They were ragged.

315
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,002
And we didn't have any money
to buy him new ones.

316
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:43,466
But that night, I went into town
and I stole a pair from a store.

317
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,969
The next day, Pablo went back to school.

318
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:55,144
Being poor is not an excuse
to look like you are.

319
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,692
You've always just taken
what you wanted, right?

320
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,527
And Pablo as well.

321
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,198
Mr. Ambassador,

322
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:11,035
I believe people fall
into two categories, basically:

323
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,537
those who rely on hope...

324
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,249
and those who rely on faith,

325
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:20,503
who see a system at work in the world
and are devoted to it.

326
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:26,467
It may be religion,
but in the case of police work, a method.

327
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,346
I'm guessing that you fall
on the faith side.

328
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,639
Correct.

329
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,226
We can catch Escobar
in any number of ways.

330
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,856
But if the one we choose
furthers an already strained relationship

331
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,775
between the Colombian people
and its police,

332
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:47,071
a strain caused by
years of corruption and abuse,

333
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,781
then we'll have lost.

334
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,325
Even if we catch him.

335
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,703
Your philosophy is our philosophy,
Colonel.

336
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,623
Yeah, we'll see about that.

337
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,916
Thank you very much.

338
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,295
- Good to sit down with you.
- Mr. Ambassador,

339
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,089
the whole world is watching
how we handle this.

340
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:10,678
I won't allow it to be corrupted
by outside interests or darker instincts.

341
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,277
It worked.

342
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,988
We're even.

343
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:34,327
I need you to help me get a visa
and get my family out of Medellín.

344
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,579
Somewhere Pablo can't find us.

345
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,999
It doesn't work like that.

346
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,960
I'm sorry.

347
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,170
So, then...?

348
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,173
How am I supposed to be okay?

349
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,996
Is this how things are going to work
from now on, Peña?

350
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:23,334
Don't worry about it, okay?
It won't happen again.

351
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:28,006
No. I'm not worried.

352
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,018
Leave us.

353
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,402
Life's funny, Velasco.

354
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,489
This could easily
have ended up in reverse.

355
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:59,412
Me lying there,
you and your men ready to torture me.

356
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,166
Look how everything's changed.

357
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,181
We are both loyal soldiers.

358
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,313
Serving our generals.

359
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,566
But you know what?

360
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,862
When it's time to give up your boss...

361
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,118
...we give up our boss.

362
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:51,464
Ma'am, nothing about Pablo, but...
he gave up this.

363
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:05,061
- Three of his accountants.
- And their addresses.

364
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:09,107
He also told me Pablo
still has a large army and a lot of money.

365
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,819
Yes, but that could be complete bullshit,
no? To scare us off.

366
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,199
Or it could be true. To scare us off.

367
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,625
There lies the key.

368
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,088
If we leave him without money,
we leave him without an army.

369
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,298
Something else.

370
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,509
Velasco was going to the airport tomorrow

371
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,554
because the Lion will be arriving
in the afternoon from Miami.

372
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,606
Excuse me, sir. It's Judy Moncada.

373
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,825
Mrs. Moncada.

374
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,453
How can I help you?

375
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,516
How was your trip? You must be beat.

376
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,143
Let's go. Get in.

377
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,811
Where's Velasco?

378
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,542
There he is.

379
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,378
Welcome.

380
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,633
- Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela.
- Lion.

381
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,594
This is my brother, Miguel.

382
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,347
And this gentleman is our associate,
Pacho Herrera.

383
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,100
I'm very pleased to meet you, gentlemen.
It's a pleasure.

384
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,395
Lion... May I call you that?

385
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,358
- Yes, sir.
- Have a drink. Relax.

386
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,820
They say, over there,
that you like whiskey.

387
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,284
Listen, gentlemen,
if I did something to offend you, or...

388
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:30,915
What? Would we offer you a drink
if we were offended?

389
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,459
Have a seat.

390
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,306
Tell me something, Lion.

391
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,977
Do you like working for a thug?

392
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,402
One...

393
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:03,239
two, three!

394
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,616
Very good.

395
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,326
Good job.

396
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,953
Look after your sister.

397
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,793
What happened?

398
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,503
Hey, boss...

399
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,007
Lion just called, sir.

400
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,635
He said Velasco never showed up
at the airport, sir.

401
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,723
Lion got scared shitless and left.
He took a plane back to Miami.

402
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:33,311
Fucking Lion.
Is he a little bitch or what, brother?

403
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:37,606
- And where is Velasco?
- Boss, I have no idea.

404
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,652
Find him for me.

405
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,654
Right away, boss.

406
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:59,086
- I can't believe you're cooking.
- But you know I always helped my mother.

407
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,630
Uh-uh. I helped while you ate.

408
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:09,764
You know, I'm very happy
that Pablo brought me here.

409
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,807
But I'm worried about you.

410
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,810
No. There's no reason to worry.

411
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,687
For God's sake, Tata.

412
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,857
Every cop in the country
is looking for Pablo.

413
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,736
Every drug trafficker
who's not from Medellín wants him dead.

414
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,323
And you're telling me there's no reason
to worry? Don't kid yourself.

415
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,660
Today is a good day, Carlos.

416
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,705
My family is all together. You're here.

417
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,338
Pablo is a strong man.
He's always had to be.

418
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,383
There's no reason to change anything now.

419
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,854
I hope you're hungry.

420
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,870
Come inside, I'm packing.

421
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,498
Are you going to let me go to Medellín
or what?

422
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,334
Is that why you accepted the job?

423
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,670
You never should have volunteered.

424
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:27,049
But you can't be reassigned now,
because it would end your career, right?

425
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,844
Sure, only now I'm gonna be
"the boss's son."

426
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,516
It appears to me you don't understand
what's happening.

427
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,311
I accepted because I wanted
to help my country.

428
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,315
Come here, I want to show you something.

429
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,614
I received this urn with my name.

430
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,745
Look. On behalf of Pablo Escobar.

431
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,542
It's an obituary.

432
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:08,382
Look, son, you're going to do
exactly as I tell you.

433
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,051
I'm going to make sure you survive this.
Understand?

434
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,269
We're polishing
this bottle off pretty fast.

435
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,772
Listen, I am not missing my flight
for anything tomorrow.

436
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,399
Mmm?

437
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,526
No.

438
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,405
You sure you can't stay?

439
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:37,161
I can't leave Olivia
with my sister forever, Steve.

440
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,998
- Anyway, you'll be in Medellín.
- Ah.

441
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:45,419
You know,
I met the new head of Search Bloc.

442
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,338
- Yeah?
- He's an interesting guy.

443
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,674
I have a good feeling about him.

444
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,805
Before I forget, I want you...

445
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,642
I want you to give this to Olivia.

446
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,563
Meant to be good luck.

447
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,277
You keep it then.

448
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,078
I am gonna miss you.

449
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,291
From now on,

450
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,795
the Search Bloc is going to operate
in a more systematic fashion.

451
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,467
Since we unfortunately cannot
rely on the information given to us

452
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,219
by the people of Medellín...

453
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:40,474
we are going to implement
a quadrant search.

454
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,061
We will position ourselves
in the neighborhoods

455
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,356
where we believe Escobar
and his allies might be,

456
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,192
proceed to search them...

457
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,071
and if we don't find
what we're looking for,

458
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,783
we'll process anything of value
and continue on to the next one.

459
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,453
- Understood?
- Yes, Colonel!

460
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,583
A fucking grid search?

461
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,961
Isn't that how they caught the guy
who shot Abraham Lincoln?

462
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:12,631
- It's a change.
- Yeah, it's dated and conventional.

463
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,220
Well, we tried going
bullet for bullet with him,

464
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,139
and you saw how that ended up.

465
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,309
Oh, so that's it?

466
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,562
A week ago you volunteered
to jump into a chopper with Carrillo

467
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,063
and now it's a change?

468
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:34,737
Don't worry about it, man. We'll all
feel better once Escobar's in the ground

469
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,157
- one way or another, right?
- There is no other way, Javi.

470
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,951
Search Bloc is the only game in town.

471
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,623
You really think this asshole
can get it done?

472
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,958
I don't know. Maybe he'll surprise us.

473
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,587
Okay.

474
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,590
Grid search it is.

475
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,567
What did you find out from Velasco?

476
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,113
Not a fucking thing.

477
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:22,534
That son of a bitch turned out to be
a lot tougher than I thought.

478
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,967
Is that what I think it is?

479
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,849
Rules of the game:

480
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,979
We only go after armed people. Sicarios.

481
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:58,028
There won't be any information
about businesses or labs or shipments.

482
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,739
This isn't about helping Judy.

483
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,908
This is about killing Pablo.

484
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,542
Well, then...

485
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,963
here's to killing Pablo.

486
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:22,511
Of course, Peña knew
the information he had given Berna

487
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,929
was already bearing fruit.

488
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,767
For Colombia!

489
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:50,873
The Castaños and their men
were efficient, if not always subtle.

490
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,709
It didn't matter.

491
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,961
What's newsworthy
about a few dead sicarios

492
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,713
in the murder capital of the world?

493
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,263
Of course, I'm not sure Javi knew

494
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,224
just how fucked up things
were really gonna get.

495
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,813
Follow me and cover me!

496
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,444
Hard to feel sorry for a bunch
of drug dealers getting whacked, right?

497
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:27,868
These guys had sown a lot of violence
over the years... killed a lot of people.

498
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,914
It was about time they got some payback.

499
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:37,044
But turning a bunch
of well-armed vigilantes loose

500
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,921
on the streets of Medellín...

501
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:45,010
was like pouring gasoline on a fire
that was already out of control.

502
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,278
Boss?

503
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:12,746
Sorry to bother you, but something bad
is happening in the city, boss.

504
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:16,166
Five of our men, dead.

505
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,919
Who was it?

506
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:23,840
I don't know, boss. If I knew,
I'd kill the son of a bitch that did it.

507
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:27,719
Boss, I'm so sorry,
but La Quica's on the phone.

508
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:44,319
- And Velasco?
- It looks like a battlefield, boss.

509
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:52,578
No one's seen Velasco
and no one knows where he is. Boss...

510
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,080
you know that if someone
grabbed Velasco...

511
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,040
Yes.

512
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,428
Start packing.

513
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,767
Your turn, let's do it again.

514
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,270
My little rock made of paper...

515
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:23,942
how much do you want to eat?

516
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,654
Show your grandmother
how you washed your hands.

517
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,792
Looks good.

518
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,670
Pardon me.

519
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,718
Should we start?

520
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,804
Dig in, dig in.

521
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,892
So good.

522
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,226
A spoon?

523
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,104
There's no spoon, love. How about a fork?

524
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,000
Martinez was right.

525
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,419
We all need a method.

526
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:31,051
Something to cling to when the shit
around us gets so deep, we might go under.

527
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:37,057
Something to guide us home
when we feel we've lost our way.

528
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:42,729
If we're lucky, someone gives us
a method and we follow it.

529
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,233
If not, we find our own.

530
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:50,612
Pablo's enemies
had found their own method.

531
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,572
And it was an ugly one.

532
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:58,078
They had opened up a new war against him,
striking from the shadows.

533
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:02,999
Showing him that, even in his hometown,
he wasn't safe.

534
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,963
The Castaños are very efficient.

535
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,173
But not very discreet.

536
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:17,097
No one can know
we had anything to do with this.

537
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,642
And the moment
their method became apparent...

538
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,185
Excuse me.

539
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,104
...the message was clear.

540
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,107
There was a new player in town.

541
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,735
What does it say?

542
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,028
And they weren't fucking around.

543
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:36,032
"Your days are numbered, Pablo.
No one around you is safe."

544
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,452
Signed "Los Pepes."

545
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,165
Who in the hell are Los Pepes?
