00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,722
Dad? Dad?

169
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,474
Pablo, my love?

170
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,187
Of course, Santa will bring you
everything you want, like always.

171
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,272
Christmas without Christ.

172
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,903
Pablo.

173
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,616
I'm planning on going to
the advent service tomorrow with the kids.

174
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,952
What? No.
No one should leave this house.

175
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,538
I'm sure the kids would love
to see the lights, Pablo.

176
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,748
[Tata] The children are staying here
and so are you.

177
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,084
[Hermilda] Remember the first time
you saw the fireworks?

178
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,754
My love, can you tell your mother
she can't take the children to Medellín?

179
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,131
[Pablo]
Mama, it's best for us to stay here.

180
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,300
It's been a month
since I've gone to church.

181
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,345
I'm sure that God
can hear your prayers from here.

182
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,555
[Blackie]
Don Pablo.

183
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,899
Boss, they killed three more of our men.

184
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,735
They found Jairo dead next to the river.

185
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:27,241
- [low chatter]
- Look, it's the Baccarat Crystal.

186
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,326
- Thank you.
- Oh!

187
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,955
- That's also Baccarat Crystal.
- Feel the weight. Look...

188
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,206
[woman taps on crystal]

189
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,419
You can feel it's Baccarat.
This is from the Lloredas, right?

190
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,920
How's it going, my love?

191
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,798
My love, look at what
the Lloredas brought.

192
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:47,678
- Look, there's two.
- The Lloredas always treat us well...

193
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,680
[chatter continues]

194
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,975
NEW DEATH SQUAD IN MEDELLIN

195
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,229
[Gilberto]
As gratifying as these displays may feel,

196
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,940
I'm not comfortable with these signs.

197
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,360
They invite too much attention
and will lead to questions.

198
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:08,115
Our objective is to eliminate Escobar
as efficiently and discreetly as possible.

199
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,700
Without a doubt.

200
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,920
No more proclamations or manifestos
or letters to the media.

201
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,172
What about Miami?

202
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,635
We buy time.

203
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,346
Let him think he still has control.

204
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,973
Until the moment we take it from him.

205
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,566
- [in Spanish] New intel from the embassy.
- Thank you.

206
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,493
[in English] Centra Spike
give us anything good for Christmas?

207
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,329
Well, Blackie's been getting calls
from Envigado.

208
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,666
The son of a bitch has got a girlfriend.

209
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,965
Here, I'll give that to Martinez.
I'm sure it's gotta get vetted.

210
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,800
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

211
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,060
[line ringing]

212
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,896
[Berna in Spanish]
What do you have for me?

213
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,314
I got something new.

214
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,902
- Blackie.
- I like the way this is going, Javier.

215
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,864
He's got a girlfriend. She's pregnant,
keeps calling. They're vetting it now.

216
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,660
It'll take a while.
Blackie's going to show.

217
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,412
It's done.

218
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,249
[Steve] I didn't know how Los Pepes
was beating us to the punch.

219
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,419
Not yet anyway.
What I did know was that if Search Bloc

220
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,463
was gonna have any kind of impact
on the hunt for Pablo,

221
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,757
we'd have to play the game
better and faster.

222
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,469
All right, Blackie's had a girlfriend
in Envigado for a while.

223
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,887
According to Centra Spike,

224
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,766
the last known intercept
places her somewhere in this vicinity.

225
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,477
Yeah. And how's that relevant?

226
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,354
Intel says she's pregnant.

227
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,358
I know protocol is to vet intel,
wait for corroboration,

228
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,736
but I feel this one in my gut, sir.

229
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,654
Blackie's gonna show.

230
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:14,533
Los Pepes keeps getting the jump on us,
sicarios are gonna keep winding up dead.

231
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,493
This way, we get to Blackie first,

232
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,455
bring that son of a bitch in
and get something out of him.

233
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:29,089
Well, we could set up a perimeter.
No one walks in or out.

234
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,050
[Steve]
Collapse that perimeter house by house.

235
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,302
- [Martinez] Yeah.
- [Steve] Sounds good to me.

236
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,893
[groans, in Spanish] Almighty Holy Child
of Atocha. Carmelita, help me please.

237
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,519
Don't fight with me anymore.

238
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,065
I'm going to tell you two things:
First, relax.

239
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,067
That's harmful for you and the baby.

240
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,528
Second, for the love of God,
take the money.

241
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,905
I'll find more later.

242
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,283
It's not for you or me, it's for the baby,
please understand.

243
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,286
Try to understand me.
I don't want your money.

244
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,663
I want you to be with me
and the baby, that's it.

245
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,626
Stop being stupid, girl.
We need that money.

246
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,269
- Listen to your dad.
- I don't know what's wrong with this girl.

247
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,130
[Blackie]
She's stubborn.

248
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,215
[chatter in Spanish]

249
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,758
- [in English] Hey!
- Hey.

250
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,009
What's going on?

251
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,887
Martinez gave the green light
to go after Blackie.

252
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,350
- It's a good thing, right?
- Yeah. Right.

253
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,394
Goddamn Christmas miracle.

254
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,249
[in Spanish]
Post three is in position.

255
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,794
[man over radio]
Yes, sir, we'll be there in five minutes.

256
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,056
[Berna]
Wait, Javier.

257
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,647
[in English]
We're moving in. Let's go.

258
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,652
[phone ringing]

259
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:18,574
[in Spanish]
Talk to me. We're just getting here.

260
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,367
Copy that, we're leaving now.

261
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,786
It was Berna.
The streets are full of Search Bloc.

262
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,373
All right, boys, the hunt is over for now.
Let's get out of here.

263
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,214
- What's going on?
- Nothing, sir.

264
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,551
We're conducting a police operation.
All good?

265
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,011
[affirmative murmur]

266
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,013
Let him through.

267
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:49,980
Keep calm, guys.
Hide your weapons while we handle this.

268
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,690
Let him through.

269
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,910
Good evening, what can I do for you?

270
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:07,956
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I need to see some form of ID, please.

271
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,833
Of course, with pleasure.

272
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,463
How's this for an ID?

273
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:27,059
Get out of the car and put your hands
where I can see them.

274
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,102
Quickly.

275
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,773
Boy, come over here.

276
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:37,444
- Colonel. Situation at checkpoint 20.
- What's going on?

277
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,714
- Armed men attempting to pass through.
- Checkpoint 20?

278
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,906
That's correct, sir.

279
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,786
- All units move to position 20.
- Understood.

280
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,372
All units to position 20. Move!

281
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,583
- [in English] What's going on?
- Some shit's going down at checkpoint.

282
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,967
[in Spanish]
My love, you have to take the money.

283
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,844
Blackie! Blackie. The cops are here.

284
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,973
Take care of the baby!
Take care, Carmelita!

285
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:11,478
We're both on the same team here.
What's the problem?

286
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:16,358
Stay where you are!
Hands where I can see them.

287
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,280
Relax, relax.

288
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,574
Want to see my ID?

289
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,161
- Take it out slowly.
- Okay.

290
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,676
You point a gun at me, motherfucker?

291
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,720
Do me a favor.

292
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,557
Move those cars because
we're not playing Cops and Robbers here.

293
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,976
[Steve in English]
What the fuck is this?

294
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,104
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

295
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,566
[in Spanish]
Relax! Relax! Relax! Relax!

296
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,401
Disarm. Disarm!

297
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,070
- No, you disarm!
- Sir...

298
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,323
[Carlos]
Lower your firearm!

299
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,785
[in English] Put the fucking gun down!
[in Spanish] Easy! Easy!

300
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,538
[Javier clapping]
Okay, tough guys. Bravo!

301
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,539
Bravo!

302
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,170
Bravo, yes, we know it.
We all want Escobar.

303
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,297
But let us do the fucking job.

304
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,260
[softly] What? You want to
kill each other at a checkpoint?

305
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,930
Lower your weapon. Lower it.

306
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,267
[whispers] Lower it.

307
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,778
Okay. These dreamers
think they're helping.

308
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,323
- Are you okay? Yeah? Everything okay?
- Yes, sir.

309
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,118
Okay. Let's go home alive.

310
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,037
- Okay?
- Okay.

311
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,455
- Let them pass.
- Okay.

312
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,543
Well then, thank you.

313
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,471
[in English]
Trying to avoid a bloodbath, brother.

314
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,484
[in Spanish]
What happened? Everything okay? Yes?

315
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,944
Yes, sir.

316
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,113
[Trujillo]
Miss, we need your cooperation.

317
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,241
Tell us where Blackie is.
Where do we find him?

318
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,034
I told you. I haven't seen him.

319
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,328
Don't be afraid. We don't want you.

320
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:36,206
We want your boyfriend, Blackie.

321
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,876
Sir, I told you,
I don't know where he's at.

322
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,420
That bastard has not come around
in a long time.

323
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,924
If you want, let's go to the station.
But I told you, I don't know where he is.

324
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,717
So please leave my house.

325
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,929
They were eight, maybe ten.

326
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,350
How did they take your firearm?

327
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,983
- I don't know, he just took it. Sorry.
- [sighs]

328
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:09,239
Next time, might as well
put the gun to your own head.

329
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,574
It's easier.

330
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,453
[sighs]

331
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,802
[in English] When were you gonna tell me
about your new friend Carlos Castaño?

332
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:40,854
He's not a friend, he's a...
he's a man with a shared interest.

333
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,315
Jesus Christ.
I hope you know what you're doing.

334
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,650
Don't worry.
It's not gonna blow back on you.

335
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,195
- No, it's not me I'm worried about.
- I can handle it.

336
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,158
These aren't the guys
you wanna be messing with.

337
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,663
They're gonna do what they're gonna do
with or without me, right?

338
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:03,919
At least this way...
I'm on the inside and I can control it.

339
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,798
- Make sure it doesn't go too far.
- So that doesn't go too far?

340
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,343
The good guys, they got guns
pointing at their fucking head

341
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,471
- and the bad guys get away with it?
- Who are the good guys, Steve?

342
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,431
That's us?

343
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,655
[in Spanish]
Mr. President, these men, the Castaños,

344
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,075
I've seen their tactics firsthand
in the jungle against the FARC.

345
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:40,038
Their method of war is murder.
I think this is only the beginning.

346
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,749
And it will get even worse.

347
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,460
Colonel, I understand your concern.

348
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:49,172
It's strange. They usually operate
against the guerrillas

349
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,801
but now they're operating
against the narcos.

350
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,429
Hugo, my cabinet is still evaluating
the best course of action

351
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,139
with regard to Los Pepes.

352
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:04,562
Sir, I'd like your permission
to engage them.

353
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:09,943
No. The greatest service we can do
for this nation is capture Escobar.

354
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,362
That's what we must focus on, Colonel.

355
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,489
It's our priority.

356
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:18,076
I understand. Thank you, sir.

357
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,165
[sighs softly]

358
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,460
[Steve] Los Pepes may have
seemed to be running the board,

359
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,921
but Escobar still had a trick or two
up his sleeve.

360
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,341
Remember I told you Ricardo Prisco
was a licensed doctor?

361
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,010
Well, he was.

362
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:39,806
And as such, he had privileges
at just about every hospital in Medellín.

363
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,601
Including the one where the Los Pepes
gunman he shot was recovering.

364
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,731
Unfortunately for that guy,
Dr. Prisco paid him a visit.

365
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,066
[in Spanish]
Let's take a look at this injury.

366
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,656
Oh... very good.

367
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,494
- [muffled screams]
- Shh!

368
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,330
[whimpering]

369
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,959
This is going to hurt.
Tell me who you work for.

370
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,004
[Pablo]
The Castaños.

371
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,382
Mmm.

372
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,051
The Castaños.

373
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,765
What could have brought them
out of the jungle?

374
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,936
I say it was money.

375
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,191
More money than Judy Moncada can find.

376
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,902
Pablo.

377
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,990
Now is not the time
to take on more problems, brother.

378
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,206
The Cali cartel thinks
they're immune to attack.

379
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,625
This can't go unanswered.

380
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,127
Go.

381
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,630
[men murmur in Spanish]

382
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,771
Maria.

383
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,817
[whispers] Carlos, you scared me.

384
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,542
Tata, you have to do it now.
Pablo's gone mad.

385
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,461
With everything he's planning,
there will be consequences.

386
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,630
You and the kids
need to separate from him.

387
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,465
No, Carlos.

388
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,179
[whispers] Tata, my God, listen to me.

389
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,141
There's a fearlessness to Los Pepes
that I've never seen.

390
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,269
The public declarations,
the open displays.

391
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,813
They won't stop until he's dead.

392
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:55,775
I know that, Carlos.
I've known for a long time now.

393
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,028
You know what's the only thought
on my mind?

394
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,698
That this is the last time...

395
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,744
the last time
I'll look at my husband's face.

396
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,080
The last time
I'll feel his arms around me.

397
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,500
The last time I'll see him play
with our children.

398
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,087
I automatically push that idea
out of my mind.

399
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,922
And now? Hmm?

400
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,429
Now I know, Carlos, that wherever I go...

401
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,766
I'll always be Pablo Escobar's wife.

402
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,770
My children will always
be Pablo Escobar's children.

403
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,939
Even if we lived in exile with him.

404
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,486
But without him? [scoffs softly]

405
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,738
No.

406
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,410
Okay. Okay.

407
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,162
Let's do something.

408
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:53,291
If we talk to him,
maybe he'll reconsider leaving with us.

409
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,796
I've had a good life.

410
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,966
Did you ever imagine we'd have all this?

411
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,979
[overlapping chatter slowly subsides]

412
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:23,279
When my niece was growing up,
she didn't think this day would come.

413
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,241
- [low chuckles]
- She was so skinny.

414
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,828
- She wore glasses and had braces.
- Yes.

415
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:34,165
When she was 12,
she thought her life was over.

416
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,545
I told her to wait and be patient.

417
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:43,132
Someday her beauty on the outside
would match her beauty within.

418
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,427
You have never looked more beautiful
than you do tonight.

419
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,555
[murmurs of agreement in crowd]

420
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,139
Cheers to the family.

421
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,935
To Marta and Diego! Cheers!

422
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,938
- [crowd] Cheers!
- [applause]

423
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,441
[up-tempo Latin music plays]

424
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,050
[whispers indistinctly]

425
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,645
[indistinct chatter]

426
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,529
[music continues nearby]

427
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,870
- [explosion]
- [people screaming]

428
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,831
[Diego] Wait!

429
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,626
Wait! Wait!

430
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,338
[woman moans]

431
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,467
[chaotic chatter]

432
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,681
[woman sobbing]

433
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:21,648
Ma! Papa! Papa!

434
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,903
- I'm here, my love.
- Mom! [sobs]

435
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,117
[sobbing continues]

436
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,250
That man...

437
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,840
has no decency.

438
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,848
To attack my family like this...

439
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,228
my daughter...

440
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,523
on the night of her wedding...

441
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,861
Only a madman would do that.

442
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:15,243
A crazed animal, dangerous.

443
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,498
I want him dead.

444
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,543
Not next year. Right now.

445
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,254
Kill all of them.

446
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,967
I don't just want you to kill his lawyers,
accountants and bankers...

447
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,053
I want you to kill his secretaries...

448
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,976
anyone who lifted a finger
to help that man.

449
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,894
I want to see them dead.

450
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:47,275
Anyone who has ever licked a postage stamp
and put it on an envelope in his name,

451
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,485
I want to see them dead!

452
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:55,491
And then I want you to find anyone who
ever shook his hand and kill them too!

453
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,580
That son of a bitch.

454
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:08,629
From this night, we'll show no mercy.

455
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,100
[Pablo]
Gilberto?

456
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,520
[La Quica]
Gilberto, Miguel and Pacho survived, boss.

457
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,939
That'll be all, Quica.

458
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,274
Thank you, boss.

459
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,367
[Carlos]
Pablo?

460
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,872
I'm worried about Tata.

461
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,626
I think you should let her travel.
She'll be safer.

462
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,796
What you're doing will have consequences.

463
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,549
That's why they're here. Right?

464
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,928
That's why they're here with me,
to be safe.

465
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,889
- Cali is going to want payback for...
- I know...

466
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,351
who my enemies are, Carlos.

467
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,271
And I can fight them all.

468
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,606
I know that.

469
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,901
But if Tata and the children
are out of the country,

470
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,028
you'd be free to wage this war
with no holds barred.

471
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,992
Let me ask you something.

472
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,380
- Why are you here?
- Pablo...

473
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,840
For Tata.

474
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,634
Right?

475
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,347
To make her happier.

476
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:47,562
To help her be more comfortable
with the life we're being forced to lead.

477
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,441
Have you done that?

478
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,155
Pablo, my sister is terrified.
And you can't see that...

479
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:03,411
Your sister is a lot tougher
than you think.

480
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:09,000
My wife... and my children...

481
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,711
stay with me.

482
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,557
[sighs]

483
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,479
[in Spanish]
Hello.

484
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,190
[in English]
Did you see this?

485
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,776
Reports of a massive bombing
in Cali last night.

486
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,196
- Gilberto Rodríguez's daughter's wedding?
- [chuckles]

487
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,031
I know of only one person in Colombia

488
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,283
with the balls big enough
to go after that guy.

489
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,076
Yeah, Pablo Escobar.

490
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,870
He had to have had a damn good reason.

491
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,874
I'd like to shift some of our resources
from Medellín to Cali.

492
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,959
Now's a bad time to deviate from Medellín.

493
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,462
Cali is trafficking
in the billions right now.

494
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,089
- If they get a free head start...
- You're not wrong.

495
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,425
But you're thinking about this
too logically.

496
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,512
The best thing for you right now
is to keep your head in the game.

497
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:07,308
Because right now,
the game is Pablo Escobar.

498
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,104
Right. Escobar.

499
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,524
I'll see you at the party tonight.

500
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,029
We could all use a few hours' break
from this shit.

501
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,115
I'll see you there.

502
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,710
Manuel.

503
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,172
[in Spanish]
Ma'am?

504
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,008
Take me to Mass.

505
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:45,596
- But the boss said we couldn't.
- Pablo worries too much.

506
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,473
Besides, you work for me.

507
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:58,025
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

508
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:04,907
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth, as it is in heaven.

509
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:10,454
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

510
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:14,500
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

511
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,128
[Christmas song plays in Spanish]

512
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,632
[man in English]
Welcome, Mr. President.

513
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,219
Welcome, Ma'am.

514
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,850
Yeah, Bogotá is beautiful. It's a lot more
like an American city than I thought.

515
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,435
I didn't know it'd be so cold.

516
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,061
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.

517
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:42,653
[in Spanish] It's shameful for the country
to stand by while a group of mercenaries

518
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,907
distributes its version
of perverse justice.

519
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,119
It makes all of us look bad.

520
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:54,332
- Including the president.
- Especially the president.

521
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:58,753
If he continues to allow Los Pepes
to do the dirty work,

522
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,421
which is his responsibility...

523
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,594
Colombia will never forgive him.

524
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,723
[church bells tolling]

525
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,350
[murmurs indistinctly]

526
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,237
MERRY CHRISTMAS

527
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,077
[engine starts]

528
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,000
[engine starts]

529
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,549
[overlapping chatter]

530
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,177
[in English]
Mr. President.

531
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,599
Lovely party, Ambassador.

532
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,895
It's nice we can pretend
we're all friends.

533
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:02,274
Believe it or not, the State Department
does the guest list, not me.

534
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:06,654
I can't wait to tell them
that he wants us to legalize drugs.

535
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,159
He thinks I should
publicly condemn Los Pepes.

536
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,455
They're criminals.
Their activities cannot be condoned.

537
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:21,043
Even if one does approve of the results.

538
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,173
[sighs]
Mr. President, I'm no one to bullshit.

539
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,467
Maybe that's hurt me in my career.

540
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,096
Yes, Los Pepes are an ugly business.

541
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,600
They're getting to Escobar.

542
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,520
That's all that matters at the present.

543
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:46,485
If I condemn them, I have to police them.

544
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:52,491
With politics and war...
the trick is in the timing.

545
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:57,830
Watch how they evolve,
how their actions are received.

546
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:03,002
And, uh, up till then,
pretend they don't exist.

547
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,796
Well, we can if you can.

548
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,846
[singing "Silent Night" in Spanish]

549
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,901
What are you up to in here?
Have a drink.

550
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,988
Thanks. Saved me a trip to the bar.

551
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,949
Call it inter-agency cooperation.

552
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:38,871
Hmm. That's a joke. And it's funny.

553
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,210
Cheers. So where are you from, Bill?

554
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,504
Originally, Oregon.

555
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,507
You were in Afghanistan, right?

556
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,135
Well, I could tell you that
but then I'd have to...

557
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,179
Funny.

558
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,478
I know Bill Haler.
He was our guy in Afghanistan.

559
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:06,607
Oh, yeah. DEA Bill, we used to call him.

560
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,276
I liked him. Stayed in his lane.

561
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,157
So, as I'm sure you know,

562
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:19,620
I recently asked for a resource redirect
into some emerging players

563
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,121
in the trafficking world.

564
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,791
- A group based in Cali. Ring a bell?
- [sighs]

565
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,419
- We're not gonna talk about work, are we?
- My request was denied, Bill.

566
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:31,423
- We were just getting to know each other.
- So I spoke to DEA Bill.

567
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,425
- He's in Washington now.
- You don't say.

568
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:37,805
And he told me the roadblock
was caused by the agency.

569
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,975
Something about an ongoing operation.

570
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:45,396
He actually said,
"That sounds like CIA Bill."

571
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:50,276
Look, I don't care what you do
with the commies and the paramilitaries.

572
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:57,866
But as soon as your ongoing operations
involve narcos... you're in my backyard.

573
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,469
[door opens, closes]

574
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,144
[in Spanish]
Where were you?

575
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,896
- I went to church.
- I told you it wasn't safe.

576
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,358
And I told you that it would be fine.
And look, everything's fine.

577
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,694
How could you put the children's lives
at risk?

578
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,863
No one here is in danger.

579
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:40,242
I'm surprised at you, Pablo.
This one has always been nervous, but you?

580
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,952
Don't talk that way to my husband.

581
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:46,790
I can talk to him however I want.
I don't know why everyone is...

582
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,877
- [gunshots in distance]
- [dogs bark outside]

583
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,718
- [gunshot]
- Take Tata and the kids!

584
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,012
- You, cover my mother!
- [automatic gunfire]

585

[panting]

Juan Pablo! Juan Pablo!
Put your coat on, quick! Put your coat on.

589
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,569
Come here, Manuela. Let's go, Pablo!

590
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,446
This way! Run!

591
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,990
- Run! Run!
- [automatic gunfire nearby]

592

- Run quickly! [screams]
- [glass shatters]

- Quickly!
- [overlapping gunfire]

594

- Pablo!
- Get out! Get out! Get out!

595
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,461
Carlos, let's go!

596
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,589
Run, Limón, run!

597
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,716
Let's go! Outside!

598
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,178
- Come on, Tata, come on.
- Get him in the car. Get him inside!

599
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,807
- Quickly! Let's go!
- Quickly!

600
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,183
Give me the girl.

601
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,019
- Get in, Tata, get in.
- [overlapping shouts]

602
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,188
Come on, brother. Go! Cover that side!

603
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,481
Move!

[indistinct shouts in Spanish]

610
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,881
They're in the house!
Let's go! Let's go!

611
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,344
- Calm down.
- Don't let her move.

612
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,262
Carlos!

613
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,972
Come on, boss! Let's go.

614
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,557
- [Tata] Pablo!
- Carlos!

No!

Los Pepes...

625
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,771
the Cali cartel, Judy Moncada,

626
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:41,692
the Castaños, the government, the gringos.

627
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,570
Let the bastards come.

628
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,991
We'll be ready for a war,
a fucking bloodbath.

629
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:53,745
We will fight like we have never
fought before in our lives.

630
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,290
Yes, boss.

631
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,793
Go for food and you go for firewood.

632
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:08,343
[softly] Whoever did this
will never get near us ever again.

633
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,725
I promise you.

634
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:26,445
Daddy, how will Santa
know how to find us?

635
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,160
[voice trembling]

636
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,832
[softly] Santa...

637
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:47,716
Santa will always find
your good and kind heart.

638
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,512
Wherever you are in this world.

639
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:57,934
Boss? The wood is all wet.
There's no way to light it up.

640
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,198
Go to Envigado for wood and food.

641
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,701
- Right away, boss.
- Be careful not to be seen.

642
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,911
Got it.

643
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,793
This is all I could find, boss.

644
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,420
How do you open that shit?

645
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,214
I'll go look, boss.

646
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,982
[in Spanish]
This just came in.

647
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,115
Shit's getting real, Peña.

[sirens wailing in distance]

649
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,839
- [Tata sniffling]
- Mommy, I'm cold.

650
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,218
She's freezing.

651
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,226
Put this on.

652
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:43,058
You and the children...
need to leave Colombia.

653
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:51,733
When you're safe,
I'll be free to do what's best for us.

654
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,953
[softly] It won't be long.

655
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,251
Soon we'll be together again.

656
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,257
Forever.
