00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,569
[Steve]
Escobar had made a career out of terror.

3
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,613
And for the most part, it had worked.

4
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,159
But when he parked 220 pounds of TNT

5
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,037
outside of a downtown Bogotá
shopping center

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,706
a week before school started up again,

7
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,167
no one could deny he had gone too far.

8
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,837
The whole nation was enraged.

9
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,883
There was no explaining this one away.

10
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,512
And no hiding from it.

11
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,932
DEATH TO ESCOBAR

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,603
- [in Spanish] Forgive me.
- [man talks loudly nearby]

13
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,067
Children and innocent people
died in that bombing.

14
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,820
That was an act of pure terrorism.
It must be answered for.

15
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,490
Surrender, unconditionally, now.

16
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:18,369
What kind of country is it
when a death squad is not only tolerated

17
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,081
but is actually sanctioned
by the goddamn government?

18
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,042
Do you want to see Bogotá
turned into a crater?

19
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:29,631
Is that what it will take to protect
my family from those bastards, Los Pepes?

20
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:34,010
No. Your family's safety
is our utmost concern.

21
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:39,808
They're simply... in protective custody.

22
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,436
Get my family out of Colombia.

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,564
We can get your family out of Colombia.

24
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:53,404
But I can't guarantee any country
will accept them.

25
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,783
I don't have that kind of power.

26
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,953
You better find that kind of power,

27
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,749
because I won't even discuss surrender
until my family is out of the country.

28
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,919
Until then, we have nothing to talk about.

29
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,129
[Steve]
That's right.

30
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:14,134
A guy who knew no bounds, no limits,
had finally gone too far.

31
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:18,096
He probably didn't know it then,
or maybe he just couldn't accept it,

32
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:22,767
but the end was coming for him,
and it was about time.

33
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,937
[Latin guitar theme music plays]

34
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,777
[in Spanish] Congressional leaders
are calling for immediate action

35
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,240
and President Gaviria has called an
emergency meeting of the national police.

36
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,092
Yesterday's bombing
has resulted in a total of...

37
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,952
Now he's really fucked up.

38
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,666
Pacho... I want you on a plane to Miami.

39
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,252
It's time.

40
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,464
And Escobar's family? Should we get them?

41
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,802
No, not now. They're surrounded by police.

42
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,930
They're not going anywhere.

43
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,811
Son of a bitch.

44
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,400
[siren wails in distance]

45
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,498
[in Spanish]
Stay there. You can go.

46
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,208
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

47
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:03,219
Agent Jimenez, put out that cigarette
and go downstairs, please.

48
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,057
- And don't smoke in the room again.
- [Jimenez] Yes, sir.

49
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,518
[cartoon plays on TV]

50
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,601
Thank you.

51
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,563
Excuse me.

52
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,357
[door closes]

53
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,943
- Who wants dinner?
- Me!

54
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,532
[Hermilda] Stop looking out the window.
There's no one out there.

55
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,200
Come eat something.

56
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,453
- [Juan Pablo] Mama?
- Yes, my love?

57
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,538
Who are Los Pepes?

58
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,962
No one. No one you have to worry about.
All right, my love?

59
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,006
And how much longer do we have to be here?

60
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,674
Not much longer, love. Keep eating.

61
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,177
Can I speak with you a moment?

62
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,476
- We have to do something, Hermilda.
- Pablo will fix this, like always.

63
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,686
We can't even call him.

64
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,649
Even if we could,
all the telephones are tapped anyway.

65
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,697
[soft scoff]
We're alone, Hermilda.

66
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,701
And you're telling me
everything will be okay?

67
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,388
[in English] Our situation with Escobar
is coming to a head.

68
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,933
Due to our efforts,
his organization is shrinking.

69
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:37,063
Intel suggests that his inner circle
has been reduced to a few loyal sicarios.

70
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,773
Bit of a mixed blessing.

71
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,692
Fewer sicarios,
less radio chatter for me to trace.

72
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,153
We had a tap put on that lawyer's phone,

73
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,239
but I guess he isn't
taking any more calls.

74
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,491
[Martinez]
It's Los Pepes.

75
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:54,956
They kill Fernando Duque,
but they also killed his son... his wife.

76
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,209
But they also stabbed, viciously,
his innocent mother.

77
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,506
But I accepted a sad truth.

78
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,302
No one is willing to police Los Pepes,
so we're gonna concentrate on Escobar.

79
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,015
I would also like to say that...

80
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:18,771
I know that someone
has been in contact with Los Pepes.

81
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,190
And while it sickens me...

82
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,529
there's nothing I can or will do about it.

83
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,741
But the man standing over Escobar
when this is over

84
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,661
needs to be a Colombian police officer.

85
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,122
And not some vigilante.

86
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,377
- Thank you.
- [man in Spanish] Excuse me, Colonel...

87
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,884

90

[lighter clicks]

92
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,529
Listen...

93
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,450
I need you to prepare yourself
for some blowback.

94
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,578
It goes high up.

95
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,875
And these people aren't gonna like it
when I try to get myself out of it.

96
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,423
If they come after you
about what I've been doing,

97
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,383
you protect yourself first.

98
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,970
You didn't know anything.

99
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,056
Understand?

100
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,352
What are you gonna do?

101
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,481
I don't fucking know.

102
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,025
We've all gone off the rails down here,
Javi.

103
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,110
You heard what Martinez said.

104
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,656
If we're standing over Pablo
at the end of this, we win.

105
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,326
We can get out of this clean.

106
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,914
So I want you to think about that

107
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,417
before you make any more decisions
that you might regret.

108
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,509

[phone rings]

111
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,308
[in Spanish]
Blackie. What's going on?

112
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,687
- Do you think you can get inside?
- No, boss. I don't think so.

113
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,398
With all the police swarming around,
it's impossible.

114
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,609
Can you see the top floor?
Through the windows?

115
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,154
No, I can't. It's too difficult.

116
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,449
Keep your eyes on it, Blackie.
You might see something.

117
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,577
Sure, boss.

118
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,371
All right, as soon as you see anything,
call me.

119
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,752
Blackie, it's important
that I know they're okay.

120
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,672
Hey, boss.

121
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,216
Can you believe it?

122
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,595
Just this second,
Tata came into view, boss.

123
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,597
What do you see? Is she alone?

124
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,224
She looks beautiful. She's at the window.

125
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:04,395
She's got that dress on that you had me
bring from Miami, remember, boss?

126
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,813
The one you like so much.

127
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,109
The children, Blackie. Can you see them?

128
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,571
- [police chattering]
- There, I can see Manuela, boss.

129
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,654
[chuckles]

130
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,993
- Can she see you?
- She looks so pretty, boss.

131
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,704
Go.

132
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,206
Blackie...

133
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,418
thanks for this.

134
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,879
[line disconnects]

[police radio chatter]

137
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,518
[Steve] Remember when people used to
call Pablo Escobar the paisa Robin Hood?

138
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,687
Well, that shit was over.

139
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,941
The bombing had shocked
even his staunchest supporters.

140
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,278
Many of the folks of Medellín
who had always protected him

141
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,238
were seeing him in a different light.

142
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,002
And no one knew that better
than Los Pepes.

143
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,660
They took out ads in local papers,

144
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,829
getting the word out
to Escobar's former allies:

145
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,873
Pablo was through. Join Los Pepes or die.

WANTED: PABLO ESCOBAR - IN DEFENSE
OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE, LOS PEPES

147
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,795
And the traffickers
who didn't read the newspapers,

148
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,548
like the Gallón gang, for example,
who I doubt could even read,

149
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,260
got an in-person visit from Los Pepes'
most glamorous ambassador.

150
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,346
- Héctor.
- [in Spanish] Sir.

151
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,349
Do me a favor and bring Miss Judy a beer.

152
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,142
- Of course, boss.
- Thanks.

153
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,770
This isn't about Pablo.
Pablo is a dead man.

154
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,482
It's just a matter of time.
We're here to talk about the future.

155
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:36,612
And if you're interested in the future,
then you'll have to join us. Mmm.

156
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:41,200
Listen, Judy,
you know we never had problems with Pablo.

157
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:45,162
Plus, we had a very good relationship
with Kiko. Right, Berna?

158
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,207
- Yes.
- And that's why we made the decision

159
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,084
to stay out of this shit.

160
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,796
And that has been a good decision
for business as well?

161
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,007
Because things are very difficult.

162
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:01,220
And when all this shit is over,
the organization will change,

163
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,056
the routes will change,
this whole city will change.

164
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:12,106
And how do you know
you'll still be in business, Judy?

165
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,400
That's why I'm talking to you.

166
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,819
If all of us from Medellín are united,

167
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,947
we'll be able to say what happens
to each one of us.

168
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,414
Meet me at Montecasino
with our associates,

169
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,833
and you tell them you're on our side.

170

[Héctor]
She wants them to join Los Pepes.

171
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,098
They say Pablo Escobar is fucked,
that his time has come.

172
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,518
And that they have to decide
whose side they're on.

173
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,856
- What did they say?
- They're joining.

174
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,403
Here's the information.

175
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,615
They have a meeting
with the Castaños on Friday.

176
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,534
[La Quica]
This is big, boss.

177
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:10,789
If the Gallóns are with them,
maybe some of the other guys are too, huh?

178
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,085
[Pablo]
When is it?

179
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,963
[La Quica]
Friday at 9:00 p.m., boss.

180
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,674
[Pablo]
Take that address...

181
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,512
and go to Montecasino.

182
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,764
Take Limón with you.

183
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,017
And find out what's going on over there.

184
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,310
Quica.

185
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,147
Are you all right?

186
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,941
Yes, boss.

187
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,282
How many men can we rely on?

188
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,455
I think I can round up a hundred.
But we need cash.

189
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,960
How much money do we have on hand?

190
00:13:56,043 --> 00:14:02,758
If we collect all the money in
the stash houses, that should be enough.

191
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:06,595
It's... around this much.

192
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,475
I'm still waiting on a cash shipment
from Miami.

193
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,436
But it's harder than ever
to get it through.

194
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:21,986
Make sure we have the weapons and the men
we need when the time comes. Got it?

195
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:26,699
The only thing that matters now is getting
Tata and the children out of the country.

196
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,580
Then we can take care of business.

197
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,665
Go on.

198
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,125
[Rojas]
Yes, sir.

199
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,551
[phone rings]

200
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,013
[inaudible conversation]

201
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,724
[phone continues ringing]

202
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,183
[Steve]
You want to get that?

203
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,564
- Murphy.
- Get to Bogotá right away.

204
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,399
- Yeah? What for?
- A tier-one sicario

205
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,483
in police headquarters.

206
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,278
- Oh, who?
- Nelson Hernández.

207
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,864
You know a Nelson Hernández?

208
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,701
- No.
- Yeah, tier-one my ass.

209
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,119
AKA Blackie.

210
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,662
No shit. Blackie.

211
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,415
CNP just picked him up
outside of the Tequendama.

212
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,498
Get in a room with him
and see what he can give us.

213
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,710
We're already gone.

214
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,422
Bogotá police just busted Blackie.
Maybe he'll cut us a deal.

215
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,301
[Steve]
Nabbing Blackie was a huge deal for us.

216
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,178
Bad news for Pablo.

217
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,014
And there was more bad news
coming his way.

218
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,142
[upbeat '90s groove music playing]

219
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,438
The thing about drug dealers is
you can't trust them for shit.

220
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,776
The Lion had been running Pablo's
Miami operation for years,

221
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,860
and gotten rich too.

222
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,530
But the moment Cali
offered him a better deal,

223
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,408
he welcomed his new partners
with open arms.

224
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,286
I mean, who could blame the Lion?

225
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,665
Pablo was on his way out
and Cali was the future.

226
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,209
He had introduced them
to Pablo's bankers...

227
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,126
Oh, thank you.

228
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,212
...his smugglers, all of it.

229
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,214
Though Pablo didn't know it yet,

230
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,549
his biggest rivals
had pulled off a silent coup.

231
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,051
[in Spanish]
Pass that to me.

232
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,431
They had stolen the crown jewel
in his empire right out from under him.

233
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,810
- Guys.
- And they didn't even have to fire a shot.

234
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,689
[Valeria in Spanish]
Nothing relevant happened today.

235
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,818
Corrupt politicians, celebrity divorces.
Bullshit.

236
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,196
You don't like it, go work at CNN.

237
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,198
- [girl] Miss Velez.
- Yes, honey?

238
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,176
I'm sorry for interrupting,
but you have a call...

239
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,494
Take a message, I'm about to go on air.

240
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:39,039
Yes, but it's Pablo Escobar's wife.
She says it's urgent.

241
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,758
What are you doing? Answer the call.

242
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,891
[softly] You have to get her
to give you an interview.

243
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,733
Hello?

244
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,946
Hello?

245
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,618
I know that you and I have had
a lot of problems in the past.

246
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,206
But I need you to help me.

247
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,794
[Steve] While everyone could agree
that Escobar had to go down,

248
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,797
there was a lot of disagreement
on how to make that happen.

249
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,260
Escobar was still dangerous and many
in government wanted him to surrender.

250
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,096
To them, holding his family
was not only immoral,

251
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,182
but it could lead to more violence.

252
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,727
An upcoming presidential election
made it a big issue.

253
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,980
Gaviria was under a lot of pressure
to let the family go.

254
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,525
And it was getting harder and harder
for him to resist.

255
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:53,655
[De Greiff in Spanish] I brought all the
influence the party can bear on Gaviria.

256
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:01,497
And it seems he has agreed
to find asylum for your family.

257
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,166
[Pablo]
Where?

258
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,502
No, that remains to be seen.

259
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,714
But we will meet in his office,

260
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,095
I suppose to discuss the terms
of their relocation.

261
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,555
Thank you, sir.

262
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,433
- You're a man of your word.
- I am.

263
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,061
Now you must be of your word.

264
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,773
I will. Be sure of that.

265
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:32,569
The moment my family is safe,
we will speak again.

266
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,947
- Until then.
- Thank you.

267
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,867
She's here.

268
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,410
Bring her here.

269
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,562
Hello, Valeria.

270
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,776
I liked it more with the hood on.

271
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,907
I told them, don't take me anywhere
that doesn't have a beautiful pool.

272
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,289
It's very dangerous
to be my friend these days.

273
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,210
Come on.

274
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:49,813
Look. These are the codes for the radio.
I'll put them here.

275
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,399
And here is some cash.

276
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,528
[Pablo sighs]

277
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,488
This is for you.

278
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,575
- No, Pablo. I don't want your money.
- It's for your help.

279
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,207
I'm doing this for you.

280
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,169
[low grunt]

281
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,218
[sighs]

282
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,723
Thank you.

283
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,606
I'm worried about you, Pablo.

284
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,614
[Pablo sighs]

285
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,754
[Blackie in Spanish]
You guys can't do shit to me.

286
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,925
De Greiff offered us amnesty.

287
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,469
That's right.

288
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,889
But you have to talk to get it.

289
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,726
You want to negotiate, gringo?

290
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,187
You want to negotiate? Let's negotiate.

291
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,357
I'll give you something. Something small.

292
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,818
Blackie...

293
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,991
Blackie, Blackie, Blackie. [sighs]

294
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,830
What name did your mother give you?

295
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,585
Nelson Hernández... Lucumí.

296
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,920
[Javier]
Lucumí?

297
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,675
From the Pacific.

298
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:48,348
Lucumí, they found explosive residue
on your hands.

299
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,477
On your jacket, everywhere.

300
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,705
They're going to blame you
for that bomb, Lucumí.

301
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,585
Hey...

302
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,841
- I had nothing to do with it.
- We know that.

303
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,721
We know it wasn't your idea.
We know you're not the boss.

304
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,520
Don't let them blame you for this.

305
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:40,609
Don't let them see you as the one
who killed all those innocent children.

306
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,283
Help us and we'll help you.

307
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,372
- Give us Pablo.
- [scoffs]

308
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:58,585
No fucking way. I can't give you Pablo.

309
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,588
No fucking way I give you the boss.

310
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,257
Then give us something.

311
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,720
You have to give us something
or they'll hang you.

312
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,814
I'll give you...

313
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,526
La Quica.

314
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,574
[softly]
Faggots.

315
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,256
[men chatter indistinctly in Spanish]

316
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,681
There's a lot of them.

317
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,602
Do you think we can take all of them?

318
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,397
What's wrong, brother?

319
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,942
You're turning into a pussy.

320
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,822
If you're scared, why don't you run away?

321
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,533
Abandon the boss.
It's that easy, brother.

322
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,077
No, brother.

323
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,331
I'm loyal to the boss.

324
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,586
And if I have to die, I'll die, brother.

325
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,963
You better, motherfucker.

326
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,529
[Steve in English]
This is the biggest lead we've ever had.

327
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,240
- La Quica can give us Pablo.
- We can help triangulate from the air,

328
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,308
but really only units on the ground
can find him.

329
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:40,896
So that means that we have to drive around
Medellín hoping to get lucky

330
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,248
and La Quica is using his phone?

331
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,066
He will be because we'll be calling him
with Blackie's phone.

332
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,152
He picks up, we get a signal.

333
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,572
Tracking phones like this
is all about proximity.

334
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,491
- If you have the number.
- The number we got.

335
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,412
Okay. And who else has his number?

336
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,667
I mean, who else is gonna show up
when we track it down?

337
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,505
Just us.

338
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,885
Okay.

339
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,930
- Trujillo.
- [in Spanish] Yes, Colonel.

340
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,806
[in Spanish]
Prepare the emergency team.

341
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,309
They need to be ready
when we get the signal.

342
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,562
- Yes, Colonel.
- Martinez, get your people ready.

343
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,774
We'll start tracking them
first thing tomorrow.

344
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,442
[Hugo Jr.]
At your service, Colonel.

345
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,001
[in Spanish]
Good work on Blackie.

346
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,131
I need to know you didn't make the call.

347
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,805
The only thing I want
is to get that son of a bitch Escobar.

348
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,682
It's the only thing I want, Peña.

349
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,143
- For all the lives he has taken.
- I know.

350
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,939
But not with them.

351
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,694
I believe firmly in what the colonel said.

352
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:15,407
When Escobar dies, a Colombian cop
should be standing over him.

353
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,293
- [man] Good evening, Ms. Velez.
- Good evening.

354
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,920
Welcome, they're expecting you.

355
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,510
[Hermilda]
What is she doing here?

356
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,886
[door closes]

357
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,391
I sent for her.

358
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,394
Please, take the children to their room.

359
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,522
[whispers] Please.

360
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,483
[Hermilda]
Let's go. Let's go.

361
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,415
This is from Pablo.

362
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,629
It's a radio telephone,
so you can speak with him.

363
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,217
This is a cipher sheet
for the frequencies he'll be on all day.

364
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,056
You must keep it hidden.

365
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,020
He also sent you money.

366
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,111
Thank you.

367
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:48,750
Well, let's do the interview already.

368
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,923
You know what? Another time.

369
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,759
When all of this is over.

370
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,942
I'm supposed to be interviewing you.
I can't leave so quickly.

371
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,031
Then stay.

372
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,077
You can show yourself out
when you're ready.

373

377
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,723
Pablo, is it you?

378
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,852
So good to hear your voice, my love.

379
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,148
How are you, Tata?

380
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,192
How are our children?

381
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,570
My love, we're all okay.

382
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,572
We need you.

383
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,198
And I need you.

384
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,618
Listen, I'm going
to get you out of there soon.

385
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,329
I talked to the attorney general.
Everything is ready.

386
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,664
Shh.

387
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,834
Just hearing your voice, I feel calm.

388
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,212
I love you very much.

389
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,591
[softly]
I love you, my darling. I love you...

390
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,676
[continues indistinctly]

391
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:43,072
Mr. President, I ask you
not to take this as a failure.

392
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,369
Escobar will be brought to justice.

393
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,664
And once his family is out of Colombia,

394
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:56,044
he will reinitiate negotiations
for his surrender.

395
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,172
- I already did that.
- Yes.

396
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:03,134
Well, I've got a list here

397
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:08,431
of possible locations that would be safe
for the Escobar family.

398
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:14,354
If you ask officially,
those countries will allow them to enter.

399
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,401
Attorney General De Greiff...

400
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,363
it seems you've been misinformed.

401
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,661
Escobar's family isn't going anywhere.

402
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,206
Pardon me?

403
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,834
I won't lift a finger to find them asylum.

404
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:41,089
I am categorically opposed
to you or anyone else doing so.

405
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,424
Do you know what that means?

406
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,344
There will be no surrender.

407
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:50,181
The violence will not end.

408
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,601
And you will be the one responsible.

409
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,188
You... will be the one responsible.

410
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,777
Your promises and negotiations
have only brought us more violence,

411
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,445
while making him stronger.

412
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:10,201
This, Mr. De Greiff, doesn't end
with Pablo Escobar's surrender.

413
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,495
This...

414
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,083
This ends with his death.

415
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,214
[Pacho] No, you don't need to worry
about anything.

416
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,218
Put yourself at ease. We got it.

417
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:32,223
Miami is ours.
I'll be back in Colombia tonight.

421
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,697
What's up, little Lion?

422
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,033
Doing good. Just hanging out.

423
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,910
Is everything packed or what?

00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,706
I don't get why you're staying
in this dump, brother.

I can't get anyone on the phone, sir.

open their doors to the Gallóns,

hope he was in the area,

497

pray he picked up,

498
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:39,632
and then keep him on the line long enough
for our triangulation to pick up the ping.

499
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:44,095
And then snatch him up
without getting killed. Easy, right?

00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:43,362
- Hello, Quica. How's it going, my friend?
- Motherfucker. Who is this?

518
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:48,409
[Javier] Calm down, Quica.
Don't be nervous. What's up, Quica?

519
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,536
Who the fuck do you think you are, bitch?

520
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,707
[Edward in English]
Hey, guys, we got a hit. He's in Laureles.

521
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,460
- [in Spanish] Velén, let's go!
- Let's go, they're in Laureles!

522
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,103
Hey, Rojas, wait for me.
You're leaving me behind.

523
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,731
[kids chatter indistinctly]

524
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,775
[radio static]

525
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:27,156
- [in English] Murphy, Peña, one more time.
- Copy, copy. We're calling again.

526
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,577
[phone rings]

527
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:36,998
Hello?

528
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,669
[Javier in Spanish]
Quica. What's up, Quica?

529
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,215
Quica, Quica, Quica.
What time is it, Quica?

530
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,675
- What are you up to, Quica?
- Bastard.

531
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,178
[breathing heavily]

532
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:55,184
- [Latin music plays on radio]
- You're the accountant. How much is there?

533
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,228
I don't know. Maybe $500,000.

534
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:03,984
Looks like you're almost out of money.
Leave some for the market, fat ass.

535
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,278
So funny.

536
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,988
Why aren't you watching the car...

537
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:23,087
Sorry, but this toss of the coin...
doesn't seem like a good idea to me.

538
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,922
Let's make a deal... [grunts]

539
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,176
[upbeat Latin music continues on radio]

540
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,730
[Javier in English]
Motherfucker.

541
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,150
Here we go.

542
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,365
[starts engine]

543
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,867
[tires squealing]

544
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,579
[Steve] We got eyes on La Quica. He's
traveling in a blue Sedan, heading east.

545
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,705
[in Spanish]
Go right.

546
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,374
Pussies.

547
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,810
[in English] He's making a right
on calle cuatro. All units!

548
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,604
[in Spanish]
Copy that! We're on it!

549
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,818
[in English]
Trujillo, double back on my six.

550
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,404
[in Spanish] Perez,
close all of 4th street. Go straight.

551
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,822
We'll go this way to cut him off.

552
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,956
Come on, pussy.

553
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,883
- There! Follow him!
- [car honks]

554
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,304
Follow him! Follow him! Follow him!
To the right, the right!

555
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,766
[in English]
Come on, box him in!

556
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,649
[in Spanish]
All units, be ready for the play.

557
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,819
[grunts]

- [shouts]
- Stop!

560
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,831
[Steve]
Now I had my own history with La Quica,

561
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,418
and believe me, I would've liked
to beat him to death right then and there.

562
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,212
And I bet nobody would've cared.

563
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,131
La Quica's exploits were legendary.

564
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,301
He was Escobar's most prolific killer

565
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,888
and the guy credited for putting
the Avianca bomber on the plane.

566
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,725
But he was also his most trusted guy.
And if we could get him to flip...

567
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,893
[in Spanish]
Fucker.

568
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,853
...that would close the book on Pablo.

569
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,583
[takes deep breath]

570
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,023
[Pablo]
Limón.

571
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,609
Relax.

572
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,902
[Limón zips suitcase shut]

573
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,571
Okay, boss.

574
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,326
- Are we ready?
- They're all waiting for us, boss.

575
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,578
I think we have enough.

576
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,335
La Quica isn't answering, boss.

577
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,421
Hmm.

578
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,217
[whispers] Okay.

579
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,097
Go start the car.
I'll be there in a second.

580
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,682
Yes, sir.

581
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:34,022
[in English]
Where is the staging point for this raid?

582
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,108
[Javier in Spanish]
Where's the staging area?

583
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:39,695
You want me to hand you information,
just like that?

584
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,113
Free?

585
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,699
No, brother.

586
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:44,992
I want a deal.

587
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:49,538
Then give us Pablo... asshole.

588
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,374
I want something different.

589
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:56,295
I want to start a new life,
in the United States of America.

590
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:59,756
[in English] He says he wants
a new life in the US of A.

591
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,845
You give us Pablo Escobar,
and I'll take you there myself.

592
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,476
[slams table]

593
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,729
[Javier in Spanish]
We don't have time for bullshit.

594
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,981
Blackie already rolled on all of you.

595
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,398
[scoffs]

596
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,989
If you don't give us something fast,
of substance,

597
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:29,870
we'll buy you that ticket
to the United States... but extradited.

598
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,290
- Extradition doesn't exist.
- Fine, then a jail cell here.

599

With a sign that says "snitch"
around your neck.

[Steve]
The narcos always talk about loyalty...

601
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,599
till their own asses are on the line.

602
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:57,606
[men chatter indistinctly in Spanish]

603

604
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,210
Quica.

605
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,672
[La Quica]
Hello. Where are you, boss?

606
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,091
I'm en route, and you?

607
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,051
Me too. I'm not too far off.

608
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:35,978
I'm almost there, boss.
Are you still far off?

609
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:43,318
Pass the phone to Ricardo.

610
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:49,116
Boss, Ricardo went to get one last stash.

611
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,784
He's on his way.

612
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,539
You want me to meet you?
Are you with Limón?

613
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,215
Yes, we're almost there.

614
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:21,148
You have what you wanted.
He'll be there soon. Limón is driving.

615
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,569

Now give us the staging point.

616

[Pablo]
Pull over.

617
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,457
Give me a moment.

618
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,666
Okay.

619
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,250
Sure, boss.

620
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,842
[Pablo over radio]
Tata.

621
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:53,930
Yes, my love?

I just want you to know...
that I love you very much.

You and our children.

You may not hear from me for a while.

What's happening, Pablo?

626
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,075
What are you going to do?

627
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,245
Something I have to do.

628
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:26,338
But you know that I will never,
never leave you, right?

629
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,675
I know.

630
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,766
I love you, Tata.
