1
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,983
Good morning.

2
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,860
Good morning, Mom.

3
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,156
- Your cat bit me again.
- You stole my pencils.

4
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,783
- Why are you fighting?
- Because he stole my pencils!

5
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,347
- She's making it up.
- Stop fighting.

6
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,164
- Let's see.
- Let's go, sweetie. What time is it?

7
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,041
- 6:40 a.m.
- God, I'm late again.

8
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,961
Remember to ask your brother
what we talked about.

9
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,132
- Tell him school starts next week.
- Yes. I'll ask him, all right?

10
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,093
I still have to buy the books, everything.

11
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,512
I told you I'll ask him, my love,
all right?

12
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:59,350
And you still haven't tied your shoes.
So, like I taught you, right?

13
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,854
We have the rabbit ear,
we go around the tree, and...?

14
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,272
And it goes in the hole.

15
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,488
That was a loud one.

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,621
You threaten a man's family,
and you find out what he's made of.

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,751
Pablo Escobar was made of rage,
revenge and terror.

18
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,465
Unable to lash out directly
at his enemies in Cali,

19
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,343
he went after their prized
legitimate business,

20
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:37,847
one they couldn't hide:
their beloved chain of drugstores.

21
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:43,394
And he blew them to shit along with anyone
unlucky enough to be standing nearby.

22
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,064
We're talking dozens of bombs.

23
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:51,444
He put the city of Bogotá on edge
and the Colombian government on notice.

24
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:56,616
Continue to ignore Los Pepes, refuse to
acknowledge their crimes, and you're next.

25
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,160
LUIS LONDOÑO WHITE, KIDNAPPER OF THOSE
SERVING PABLO ESCOBAR

26
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,912
But terror brings more terror,

27
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,624
and Los Pepes responded
with their own special brand.

28
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,918
We came up with a name for their displays.

29
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,796
- Sit him there.
- Colombian folk art.

30
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,131
Over here.

31
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,134
Like I said, you can't make this shit up.

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,681
The point of all this?
Psychopaths sending a message...

33
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,892
No matter how far you go...

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,436
Look at that ugly son of a bitch.

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,647
...we'll take it one step further.

36
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,734
The gates of hell were officially opened.

37
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,863
One... two... and three.

38
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,533
And everyone was scrambling
to get out of the fire.

39
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,702
Or climb into it.

40
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,962
This family
is the only thing I care about.

41
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,215
- You're the one that...
- Me? Me, ma'am? Me?

42
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,885
- We shouldn't leave, Tata.
- All of this is your fault.

43
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,846
If you'd listened to Pablo,
my brother would still be alive.

44
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,727
Because you do that so well?
Do you listen to him?

45
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:35,775
When you're always criticizing him,
doubting him, worrying.

46
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,945
Tata.

47
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,371
I would never put this family in danger.

48
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,040
Tell her, Pablo.

49
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,252
Tell her it's not my fault, Pablo.

50
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,840
- I know, Mom.
- This isn't my fault. Tell her, Pablo.

51
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:03,469
It's not your fault. I know.
It's not your fault.

52
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,433
Everything's all right, Mom.

53
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,352
It wasn't your fault.

54
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,672
Look at these smiling faces.

55
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,008
We didn't want to make you
uncomfortable, Judy.

56
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:29,097
How considerate of you.
So that's why no one called me?

57
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,351
Because this lab belongs to the Moncadas.
Mmm?

58
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,730
So I was supposed to be notified
when it was taken back.

59
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,943
- That wasn't made clear to us.
- I'm making it clear now, Carlos.

60
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,864
- What are we going to do with that?
- All the cocaine is going to Cali.

61
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,117
That is my cocaine.

62
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:54,705
Look, Judy, we decided that not a single
kilo of cocaine will be moved in Medellín

63
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,583
until Pablo Escobar is dead.

64
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,045
That's our strategy. To asphyxiate him.

65
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,007
That's the Cali cartel's strategy?

66
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,635
To keep making money
while the rest of us go hungry?

67
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:12,473
- You know we can't trust them.
- No. Not them or any of you.

68
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,353
We don't trust any drug trafficker.

69
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:24,735
Well, let's not get personal, Carlos.
All right?

70
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,155
We all need friends.

71
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,875
Sir, would you like some?

72
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,854
Go, go, go, go, go!

73
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:07,945
Sir?

74
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,743
Are you all right?

75
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,857
Are you all right?

76
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,304
- We're done working together.
- What's bothering you?

77
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,225
The killing of innocent civilians,
for starters.

78
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,354
Whether they're innocent or guilty,
I don't decide.

79
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,189
That's what priests are for, no?

80
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,158
The Castaños are crazier than ever,
and that wasn't part of the plan.

81
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,245
But it's working.

82
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,623
Not if I stop providing you intel.

83
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,379
For what it's worth, I am on your side.

84
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,339
I don't like what's happening.

85
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,883
Medellín is my home
and I love it very much.

86
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,096
As far as the methods
of the Castaños go...

87
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:03,769
well, those are the methods
that have Pablo's people hiding like rats.

88
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,565
Including that gonorrhea of a lawyer,
Fernando Duque.

89
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:12,194
Our guys fired a whole fucking clip
at him, point blank.

90
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,490
Can you believe that these sons of bitches
didn't hit him once?

91
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,118
I need you to help me find him.

92
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,665
He's Pablo's mouthpiece
and his connection to the government.

93
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,669
What we want is to exterminate this rat.

94
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:34,508
That way, we'll get to Pablo
and we can end this madness, Peña.

95
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,400
I've told you! You have to...

96
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,821
What are you doing?
You have to bring the passports.

97
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,992
Juliana... they're trying to kill me.
We have to get out of here.

98
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,037
I think you're the one
who needs to leave.

99
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,874
Can I see Simon, at least?

100
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,710
- Where... Simon!
- Stop, Fernando!

101
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,712
Simon is at school.

102
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:18,219
Besides, this isn't even your week.
So, please... leave.

103
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,841
- Oh, what's going on?
- How are you?

104
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,384
- Bye, Anda!
- Bye!

105
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,345
Where's Mom? Why do you have her car?

106
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,305
Get in.

107
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,023
Hey, I need you
to run a trace on this name.

108
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,692
- Okay.
- Find this guy.

109
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,570
All right? You look tired.

110
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,993
Come in.

111
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,748
Go on, son. Sit down.

112
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,295
So, you're being reassigned...

113
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,216
and you will be moved into the intel unit
that was formed a couple of months ago.

114
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,846
You'll be all right there.

115
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,267
You're sending me to an office
because I made a mistake?

116
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,605
Anything else?

117
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,072
Yes, sir, Colonel.

118
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,136
How are you, Papa?

119
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,309
And you?

120
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:34,438
- How long will we be there?
- Not long.

121
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,693
Just long enough for me
to get some things figured out here.

122
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,535
Do you remember when
we went to the United States?

123
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,914
It's going to be an adventure,
just like that.

124
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,624
Do they have Disney World there?

125
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,213
Mmm, I don't think so.

126
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:19,191
Listen to your mother
and your grandmother. All right?

127
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,781
I made more than one reservation so
no one would know what flight you're on.

128
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,618
I spoke to Fernando
and he said it's perfectly legal.

129
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,664
You have every right to leave the country.

130
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:37,251
- It's like a normal trip.
- A normal trip?

131
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,924
Mmm.

132
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,971
Confess. Do you regret it?

133
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,348
Marrying me, or what?

134
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,684
Not for a second.

135
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,948
They may separate us...

136
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,495
but they'll never be able to destroy us.

137
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,881
Go.

138
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,895
The little bunny. The little bunny.

139
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,147
I'll take care of him, all right?

140
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,441
Give me a kiss.

141
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:40,040
Pablo was right. The government
couldn't stop his family from leaving.

142
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,920
But if you remember, he had
some bad history with Avianca Airlines.

143
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,092
And they made sure as shit
that everybody knew

144
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,636
the Escobars were trying to fly the coop.

145
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,768
What we know is that Escobar
bought tickets for his family

146
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,272
on eight different outgoing flights
from Bogotá.

147
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,942
Destinations ranging
from Barcelona to Toronto.

148
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,528
Mr. President,
we need to prevent that from happening.

149
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,240
We need to keep the family in play.
If they're allowed to leave Colombia,

150
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,283
we're gonna lose leverage
in the hunt for Escobar.

151
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,746
Legally, there's no way we can stop them
from flying out of the country.

152
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,306
By applying pressure behind the scenes,

153
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,517
we can prevent the family
from being accepted upon arrival.

154
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:27,087
And if they're kept in Colombia,
he's gonna be worried about their safety.

155
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:33,302
He'll be more likely to make phone
contact, more likely to... make mistakes.

156
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,681
Because they're more likely
to become victims of Los Pepes.

157
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,691
Mr. President... if the family gets safe
haven, there's no telling what comes next.

158
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,904
Maybe Escobar surrenders,
maybe he goes to war.

159
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,784
The family is leverage. We have to use it.

160
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,794
I agree.

161
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,927
I want one of your people with them
giving us updates, running interference,

162
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,055
and have them find out
where they're going. And stick with them.

163
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,488
- Murphy.
- Hey, it's Messina.

164
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,616
I need you to grab your passport
and head to Bogotá International.

165
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,534
Where?

166
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,954
The Escobars are trying to flee the
country. Wherever they go, follow them.

167
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,332
- Yeah. When?
- Now. Once you spot them, check in.

168
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,335
- And Murphy, keep this under wraps.
- Yes, ma'am.

169
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,838
Who was that?

170
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,214
Messina.

171
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,344
- Where you going?
- Going out.

172
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,472
- With your passport?
- Yep.

173
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,724
- Oh, that's all I get?
- Yep.

174
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,572
- Uh, I'd like to get some tickets, please.
- For... which flight, sir?

175
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,657
Let's see. Madrid, London...

176
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,465
It's Murphy. Get me Messina.

177
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,094
- Messina.
- Hey, it's me. It's the Frankfurt flight.

178
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,888
Germany. Shit.

179
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,933
Yes, Mr. Foreign Minister, but I'm not
talking about some Turkish date farmer

180
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,729
looking to drive a taxi in Berlin.
I'm talking about Pablo Escobar's family.

181
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,651
No. No, they haven't committed any crimes.

182
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,946
Due to events in their fairly recent past,

183
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,658
Germany had some of the softest
immigration standards in Europe.

184
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,079
If you had a pulse,
they tended to let you in.

185
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,041
Now maybe that was good for mankind,

186
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,294
and it was certainly good
for the Escobars.

187
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,421
It was very bad for us.

188
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,183
Sergeant. Private
Hugo Martinez Jr. at your service, sir.

189
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,816
The colonel's son.

190
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,947
He said you have some
technical background.

191
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,534
I took a couple
of engineering classes, sir.

192
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,205
And I built a ham in my parents' house.

193
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,335
Great. What do you know about RDF?

194
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,298
The basic concept, sir.

195
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,134
The basic concept.

196
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,098
All right.

197
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,978
Get acquainted.
We go out tomorrow afternoon.

198
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,604
And don't worry.

199
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,733
Unlike Carlos Castaño,
this won't hit back.

200
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,876
What's going on?
I'm going to freeze to death out here.

201
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,479
That's Bogotá. What do you expect?

202
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:40,841
Hey! What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why are you not working?

203
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,176
Get to work.
I'm not paying you with candy.

204
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,929
- Okay, okay.
- Pass me the phone, boy.

205
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,641
Make some fucking bombs.
You need an invitation to start working?

206
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:54,604
Hurry, boy! You get to work too!

207
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,648
And don't smoke near the gunpowder.

208
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,074
Hey, boss.
I just came back from the airport.

209
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,953
Ms. Tata, the kids and your mother
are on the plane, boss.

210
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,621
Thank the Virgin Mary.

211
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,710
That's the most important thing.
They're flying now.

212
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,295
One more thing.

213
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,298
We hit those fucking drugstores
pretty hard.

214
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,009
You tell us. Should we come home or...

215
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,971
No. Stay put. We're not done yet.

216
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,432
- I may need you again.
- Mmm.

217
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,225
Copy that, boss.

218
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,560
Thank you, Blackie.

219
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:51,203
Figure out... what...
what time it is in Germany.

220
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,206
On it, boss.

221
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,219
Boss! Boss!

222
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,350
Boss!

223
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,551
Got a bump on your guy.
About an hour ago.

224
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:52,639
Credit card belonging to Fernando Duque.
Used twice, restaurants.

225
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,433
Here, here, a couple streets over.

226
00:23:56,393 --> 00:24:00,105
Check this out.
Ran him through the CNP database.

227
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,024
A complaint got filed this morning.
Your boy's wanted.

228
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,027
- For what?
- Kidnapping and car theft.

229
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,656
Filed by his ex-wife. It's a blue Volvo.

230
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:14,035
He's running. And he's taking his kid.

231
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,871
He's 14 years old. Fuck.

232
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,672
Peña.

233
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,717
Any word on our friend?

234
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,385
Did you find him?

235
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,391
- Peña?
- Not yet.

236
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,623
- Messina.
- Hey, boss.

237
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:03,668
I think Fernando Duque's on the run.
He's got his kid with him.

238
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,671
If he's that scared, maybe he's willing
to drop privilege and cooperate.

239
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,548
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I...

240
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,135
I might have an idea where he's holed up.

241
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,305
If he comes through for us, you think
we can get him out of the country?

242
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,725
- If he'll cooperate, yes. Look into it.
- You got it.

243
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,435
- And Peña.
- Yeah.

244
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,062
How did all this come up?

245
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,442
My CI knows a girl he sees.
Kind of fell into my lap.

246
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:31,112
- Mmm-hmm. Get on it.
- Yeah, boss.

247
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,534
What's up, Peña?

248
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,037
Are we getting a beer or what?

249
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,791
Another day, brother.

250
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,752
See you tomorrow.

251
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,920
Okay.

252
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,578
No, no, no. What are you doing, Simon?

253
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:05,063
Leave it where it is.
I'm listening to the news.

254
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,400
What are we doing here?

255
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,944
I told you. We're going on a trip.

256
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,488
And what's happening? Where's my mom?

257
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,993
Simon... calm down.
I already spoke to your mother.

258
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,412
You got yourself into trouble, didn't you?

259
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,999
It's because you work for Pablo Escobar.

260
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,128
That's why this is happening.

261
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,426
You're his lawyer.

262
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,139
What are we going to do now?

263
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,518
I have a plan. Calm down.

264
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:48,732
You don't have a plan, Dad.
You're a son of a bitch. A fucking thief.

265
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,153
Did you say "son of a bitch"? "Thief"?

266
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,991
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer.

267
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,371
All of the money this family has,
we have because I've been a good lawyer.

268
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,541
- I do my job.
- I want to call my mom.

269
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,710
You want to call your mom?

270
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:12,213
Do you want to call your mom,
or do you want to behave like a man?

271
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,051
Are you going to be a pussy
and call your mom? That's a great idea.

272
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,637
Let's call her so she can tell you where
all the money for your toys came from.

273
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:23,433
Your room full of toys.
Where do you think it came from?

274
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,645
Hmm? You didn't complain
during the Christmases or the birthdays

275
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,981
or when I bought you a motorcycle.

276
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,651
But now you're complaining.
Very well. Very well. It's over.

277
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,490
It's over! Now that they're
going to kill me, it's over.

278
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,253
I'm sorry... Simon.

279
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,257
I didn't mean to say that.

280
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,550
Forgive me.

281
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,805
Everything will be all right.
Forgive me.

282
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,156
Was it a heart attack or what?

283
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,699
You fainted, Pablo.

284
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,747
How many of those are you taking?

285
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,544
I've had a terrible headache.

286
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,422
Those aren't any good, Pablo.

287
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,049
You shouldn't put so much shit
in your body.

288
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:45,598
You're better off... taking these drops.
They're homeopathic.

289
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,977
Three drops under your tongue
in the morning and two at night.

290
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,697
Have you ever been to Disney World?

291
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,241
I haven't.

292
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,162
It's beautiful.

293
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,208
It's very organized. Very clean.

294
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,339
What's wrong with me, Ricardo?

295
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,259
Stress.

296
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,886
Mmm.

297
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,512
Stress is dangerous.

298
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,098
How's the weed working out?

299
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,060
I haven't been smoking a lot.

300
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:37,650
The first man who smoked marijuana
was a Chinese emperor.

301
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,863
He burned the plant because
he was attracted to its smell.

302
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,533
But when he inhaled the smoke,
he saw a blue jay.

303
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,415
And the bird told him
to conquer his neighboring empires.

304
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,083
And that's what he did.

305
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,547
All right.

306
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,843
With you until death, Don Pablo.

307
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,304
Thank you.

308
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,601
I'd like to stay and stand guard.

309
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,983
All right. Thank you.

310
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:37,877
Let's see, darling.
Color inside the lines.

311
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,880
There it is.

312
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,408
Attention, ladies and gentlemen:

313
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,828
We will be passing around
immigration cards.

314
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,631
This is our stop.

315
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,589
Foreign ministry isn't cooperating.
We need more time.

316
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,682
Don't let them leave the airport.

317
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,728
- They do, it's over.
- Right, right, right. Talk to you soon.

318
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,908
Sir, I'm with the United States DEA.

319
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,636
There's passengers on this flight
who can't be allowed into this country.

320
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,748
Heard of Pablo Escobar? Cocaine? That's
his family. You can't allow them in.

321
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:00,668
Unless there is a problem with
their passports or any type of contraband,

322
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,878
they may enter Germany.

323
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:08,468
What about if they're transporting
a large amount of foreign currency?

324
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,971
- You would be certain of this how?
- I saw it. I saw it with my own eyes.

325
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,058
I work with the DEA, been with
this family, I've been tracking Escobar

326
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:18,061
for a long goddamn fucking time.
It is in that bag.

327
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,480
- In which item of luggage?
- The maroon bag.

328
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,565
Perdón?

329
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,109
- Do you speak English?
- No.

330
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,237
I'm a hundred percent certain.
That burgundy bag.

331
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,156
Fucking hell.

332
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,705
- Hello. Pablo Escobar? Familia Escobar?
- Sí.

333
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,501
- You speak English? German?
- No.

334
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,521
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

335
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,838
Come with us.

336
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,275
- What's going on?
- Can you give me back my passport?

337
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,470
To be honest, I'd never actually
seen any cash in the bag.

338
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,391
That money is ours.

339
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,352
But I knew Pablo
would never let his wife go anywhere

340
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,854
without some serious walking around money.

341
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,525
- Pablo, they're not letting us in.
- No, no! They can't do that.

342
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,277
- That's what they're doing.
- They can't...

343
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:12,532
Listen, Tata, that's illegal.
That's illegal. Don't worry.

344
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,866
Don't worry, because...

345
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,954
Do what you need to do to get us
into Germany. I have to hang up.

346
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,707
Don't touch me!

347
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,110
- Please come now.
- Let go!

348
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,174
No, no, no! No!

349
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,052
Shh.

350
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,848
Fernando Duque.

351
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,391
Javier Peña.

352
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,271
It took me one day to find you.

353
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:29,108
If you don't want them to kill you,
you need to start doing things better.

354
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,823
Please... get me out of here.

355
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,827
Please get me out of Colombia. Do you know
who I work for? Who I worked for?

356
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,580
Well, our help isn't free.

357
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,335
We need full cooperation.

358
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,879
Dad!

359
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,257
Hey, Simon, it's all right.

360
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,178
It's all right. Uh, go back inside.
I'll come up soon.

361
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:04,936
It's my son. He's... He's scared.

362
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,856
First, we'll get you to Holguín.
You'll be safe...

363
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,610
No, no, no! No. No, no.
No, we're staying here.

364
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,864
There are cops working
for Los Pepes everywhere.

365
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:22,453
It would be better if you get us
to the United States at once.

366
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,333
- I'll cooperate with you.
- Anything you want.

367
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,044
I'll cooperate with you.
Please get us out of Colombia.

368
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,421
Is that a deal?

369
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,679
Do as I say.

370
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:44,225
Start by hiding your fucking wife's car.

371
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,402
While the authorities were using
all the political pressure they could

372
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,863
to keep Escobar's family in play,

373
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,741
Pablo was practicing
his own special form of diplomacy.

374
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,370
First, he called the German embassy

375
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,580
in Bogotá.

376
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,292
Hello, German embassy.

377
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:14,797
First of all, I'll kill every last German
son of a bitch that lives in Colombia.

378
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:19,010
Then I will bomb Frankfurt, Munich...

379
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,096
Then he threatened to bomb
a couple of Lufthansa planes.

380
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,018
I'm going to shove bombs
up your asses, you bastard motherfuckers.

381
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:31,898
Nazi, racist gonorrheas.
I'm going to kill all of you. You hear?

382
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,858
I'm going to kill all of you!

383
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,445
Then he dialed up President Gaviria.

384
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,488
Who couldn't take the call.

385
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,992
Because he was already on the phone
with the German ambassador.

386
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:51,834
And then, Pablo did something
he'd never done before in his life.

387
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,671
He called a cop and he asked for help.

388
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,800
Not just any cop,
but the top cop in the country:

389
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,928
Attorney General De Greiff.

390
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:08,059
I once heard you say that I had the same
rights as any other Colombian citizen.

391
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,772
I imagine that also applies to my family,
correct?

392
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,235
The government hasn't done anything
to stop Los Pepes,

393
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,989
those terrorists who have attacked
my family and murdered my associates.

394
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:27,286
Is that how the Colombian government
ensures the rights of all its citizens?

395
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:31,874
The president is trying to prevent
my family from entering Germany

396
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,501
and yet you do nothing about it.

397
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:38,965
That man wants to dangle my family before
Los Pepes and use my children as bait,

398
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,760
and you, who call yourself a man
of principle, do nothing about it.

399
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,655
There's a lot of interference.

400
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,367
Yes. Medellín has too many electrical
wires, phone wires, antennae.

401
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,453
- That must be why.
- What's your success rate?

402
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,873
To be honest,
we haven't located a signal yet.

403
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,709
Not one?

404
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,794
Not one.

405
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,012
Here's what we're going to do, Morales.

406
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:31,767
Let's both start here: L9.329.

407
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,520
There it is.

408
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:48,576
I was talking to my police contact and
you won't guess who's hiding the lawyer.

409
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,581
None other than that son of a bitch, Peña.
What do you think about that?

410
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,834
Who's your contact?

411
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:01,672
Who he is isn't important.
The important thing is that I trust him.

412
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,884
And you know what
the worst part of this is?

413
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,053
We can no longer trust Peña.

414
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,014
Then we'll have to put a bullet in him.

415
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,267
No.

416
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,021
We can't kill DEA agents.

417
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,065
Oh, no? Why not?

418
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,737
If it were up to me,
I'd feed him to the crocodiles.

419
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,699
Berna, look...

420
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:40,544
Schedule a meeting with Peña,
just as you have been.

421
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,381
We'll take care of the rest.

422
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,486
Agent Peña.

423
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,950
I don't think Don Berna's
gonna make it tonight.

424
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,006
What is this?

425
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,716
Just a friendly chat.

426
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:15,181
You're making some very scary people
pretty nervous, Javier.

427
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,393
Which puts me in a spot because...

428
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,438
I'm the one who suggested
they approach you in the first place.

429
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:28,319
Now, I don't know what you know
about what it is I do,

430
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,321
but understand this:

431
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,866
I have our nation's
long-term interests in mind.

432
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,951
That's the beat I walk.

433
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,455
And sitting here tonight,
that means making sure the right folks

434
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,875
are left standing when Escobar
gets his bullet.

435
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,631
So do Uncle Sam a solid.

436
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,384
Don't complicate that.

437
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,021
These folks are prone
to emotional decision-making.

438
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:10,152
Which can lead to bush league nonsense
like... killing a federal agent.

439
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,823
By the way, they found the lawyer.

440
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,451
Even without your help, so...

441
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,490
COURTESY OF LOS PEPES

442
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:45,497
Córdoba recovers,
we'll have a goalie in place.

443
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:49,877
Leonel Álvarez can do his thing
and move the ball along. Ooh-wee!

444
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,755
Trujillo!
You follow me to the fucking hotel?

445
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,881
Huh?

446
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,385
Did you follow me
to the hotel? You told Berna?

447
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,888
Let go.

448
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,765
Tell me, asshole.

449
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,410
- Let go! It's all right.
- What's the problem?

450
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,145
I'll catch up. Everything's fine.

451
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,231
What's going on, Peña?

452
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,319
Playing the fucking American?

453
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,198
Did you see what they did to his son?

454
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,912
How many families has Pablo Escobar
destroyed, Peña? Do you know?

455
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,084
You don't decide who lives and who dies.

456
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:34,296
Don't be fucking stupid.
This is how we do it.

457
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:06,912
I understand that you're
trying to prevent Escobar's family

458
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,122
from entering Germany.

459
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,957
Let's make something clear:

460
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,628
If you've come to plead for them
as part of some deal, the only...

461
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,463
No, Mr. President.

462
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:24,346
I haven't come to plead for them.
I've come to plead for you.

463
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,642
For me? How so?

464
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:32,896
I know that you want Escobar dead.

465
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,359
And while I don't agree with that,
I understand it.

466
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,614
But this... this I can't understand.

467
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,702
This isn't just wrong.

468
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:53,584
It puts you, the president of Colombia,
in league with a death squad.

469
00:45:55,002 --> 00:46:01,216
Call the German chancellor.
Tell him to let the family in.

470
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:24,531
I'm sorry to inform you,
your entry into Germany has been denied.

471
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,454
I know my rights, sir.
But you don't understand.

472
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,097
My children are in danger.
Send me any place other than Colombia.

473
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:40,130
Tell him the children are
under age. We just want to live in peace.

474
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,507
We just want to live in...

475
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:47,304
No, no, no.
Tell him that's all we want to do.

476
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,556
To live in peace.

477
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,019
Get the children and your belongings.

478
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,187
Please.

479
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,487
They kick us out of
the country, and they keep the money, too.

480
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,490
I know. I'm going.

481
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,660
What is this?
Why are we being treated this way?

482
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,870
You can't treat us like criminals.

483
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,205
Let's go.

484
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,558
Pardon me.

485
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,811
I hope you enjoyed Germany.

486
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,378
- How much for this?
- Two thousand pesos.

487
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,048
Thank you.

488
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,378
Ladies.

489
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,802
Stop! National police!

490
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,387
- DEA!
- Get on the ground!

491
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,975
It's all right, ma'am, we're with
the national police. Come with us.

492
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,728
The attorney general asked us
to put you under protective custody.

493
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,648
Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Come with us. You'll be safe. Let's go.

494
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,694
- Come with us.
- Let's go. Quickly. Let's go!

495
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,262
How can I help you, boss?

496
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,435
I want this faggot of a president
to know what happens

497
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:07,314
when you're on the side
of those bastards, Los Pepes.

498
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:13,612
I want to see blood.

499
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,658
I want the sky to burn with gunpowder.

500
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:23,705
I want you to put the biggest bomb
you can get your hands on

501
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:27,209
as close as you can to
the Presidential Palace. Are we clear?

502
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,712
As you wish, boss.

503
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,471
My love, let's go. Let's go.

504
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:11,146
Do you want one? Yes? How much?

505
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,480
One hundred pesos.

506
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,276
- Here.
- Thank you.

507
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,239
- Are we going that way?
- That way, darling.

508
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:26,036
You better be a doctor when you grow up.
This is very expensive.

509
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,622
Elena! Elena, let's go!

510
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,222
220 pounds of C-4.

511
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,726
Same as a bomb on an F-16.

512
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,355
Dozens were killed.

513
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:58,234
Scores were injured,
many of them children.

514
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,905
Pablo never took credit for the bomb.

515
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,367
He didn't have to.

516
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,175
Elena?

517
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,181
Elena!

518
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,935
Elena!

519
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,730
Lift him up carefully!
