00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,320
[Steve]
Okay. Here we go again.

2
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,323
- [overlapping gunfire]
- [chatter in Spanish]

3
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,075
Let me break it down for you:

4
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,203
Four thousand soldiers...

5
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,416
a 250-man team
of Colombia's elite forces...

6
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,296
tens of thousands of rounds fired...

7
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,882
[explosion booming]

8
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,593
- ...seven dogs...
- [dogs barking]

9
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,387
...and four fuckin' helicopters.

10
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:59,017
Pablo Escobar was surrounded
in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

11
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,772
There was no way
he was getting out of this one... right?

12
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:08,276
[in Spanish] Hey, Jimenez. Do you think
the Special Forces guys killed him?

13
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,320
If he can even be killed, that is.

14
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:14,032
- [overlapping gunfire in distance]
- [helicopters whirring above]

15
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,994
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

16
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,832
I don't know.
I heard they shot him 20 times.

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,710
They pumped him full of lead.

18
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,130
Then they burned his body
and spread his ashes all over Medellín.

19
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:35,053
They say that he rose from the ashes,

20
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,264
and he went to the houses
of each of the men who had shot him,

21
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,142
- and he killed them as they slept.
- [rustling in bushes]

22
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,519
- Bullshit.
- [twig snaps]

23
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,479
[man]
Quiet! Someone's coming.

24
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,000
[man over loudspeaker]
We're soldiers from the National Army!

25
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,276
Stop and identify yourselves!

26
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,695
We're well armed!

27
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,616
[twig snaps]

28
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,547
Mr. Escobar.

29
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,342
I'm sorry, but we've been ordered
to not let you through.

30
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,845
We have to take you into custody.

31
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,940
Son, I'm sorry to say...

32
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,195
unfortunately,
I can't allow that to happen.

33
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,539
[Pablo]
Excuse me.

34
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,180
You don't speak a word of this to anyone,
understood?

35
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,851
[Latin guitar theme music plays]

36
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,784
[Steve]
Yep.

37
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,997
Life ain't fair, man.

38
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,376
Pablo Escobar? He was headed home.

39
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,130
As for me and Connie, well,
we were in some deep shit,

40
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,715
and I hadn't even heard the news.

41
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,050
[Steve]
This is what I do. This is my job.

42
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,469
No, don't you dare say this is your job.

43
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,680
I know what your fucking job is.

44
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:09,058
And it doesn't entail being kidnapped
by a Colombian drug cartel.

45
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,894
Listen, I'm sorry, I am.
I know it must've been tough for you.

46
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,940
Listen, but Connie,
I was never in any danger.

47
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,276
I'm here now, back with you.

48
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,279
Hmm?

49
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,868
All I want... is for us to be safe.

50
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,723
I want to get the hell out of this place
and I want to go home.

51
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,333
[phone ringing]

52
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,588
[sighs]

53
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,924
- Murphy.
- Escobar's out.

54
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,260
- What?
- He's fucking out.

55
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:49,640
He took Sandoval hostage during the siege
and when the army went in... he escaped.

56
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,017
Walked right out.

57
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,400
Pick me up in ten minutes.
I'll meet you downstairs.

58
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,444
[Connie scoffs]

59
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,659
Escobar's escaped.

60
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,375
[Steve]
And you know what?

61
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,253
I was happy about it.

62
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,008
The fox was out of the cage
and the hunt was on.

63
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,010
[chuckles]

64
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,640
Yeah, it was the biggest
law enforcement blunder of all time.

65
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,101
Fortunately, it wasn't our blunder.

66
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,685
[in Spanish]
This...

67
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,921
is an enormous embarrassment
for all of Colombia, gentlemen.

68
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,150
[grunts, low murmurs]

69
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,485
So...

70
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,405
- how will we proceed?
- Mr. President...

71
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:54,789
Mr. President, Escobar will surely attempt
to reestablish himself within the city,

72
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,459
and we can't allow him and his sicarios
to move freely.

73
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,004
So my recommendation, Mr. President,
is that we occupy Medellín.

74
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,758
Flood the streets with officers.
Conduct searches.

75
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,554
Close down the streets.
Establish vehicle checkpoints.

76
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,397
Pressure him until he appears,
Mr. President.

77
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,474
And who would conduct such an operation?

78
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,601
Colonel Pinzón, sir.

79
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,606
- He should begin immediately.
- Of course, Mr. President.

80
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,652
- [overlapping murmurs]
- [Gaviria] Are you injured?

81
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,530
No, I'm not hurt.

82
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,073
You know I couldn't talk to him.

83
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,659
I couldn't negotiate with Escobar.

84
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,581
- I understand.
- Why did you go inside?

85
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,708
I sensed something was off.

86
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,587
Ariza said his orders were
to secure the perimeter, that's all.

87
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,881
Well, he lied. I gave the order myself.

88
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,593
Go home and get some rest,
but come back soon.

89
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,888
You know you're the only person
I can trust.

90
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,098
Yes, sir.

[vehicles approaching]

92
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,735
It's all right, Tata. I'll be right back.
Excuse me, Doña Hermilda.

93
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,947
Boss.

94
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,094
- It's good to see you.
- It's great to have you back home.

95
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,703
Very good to see you.

96
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,914
[Hermilda]
He's here. It's him.

97
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,751
- Praise the Lord. I knew it. I knew it.
- How are you, brother?

98
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,169
Pablo!

99
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,010
Thank God.

100
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,555
- Oh, my son!
- How are you?

101
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,991
- I'm all right.
- You're all right?

102
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,391
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

103
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,060
- You're all right?
- I'm all right.

104
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,403
- I did everything I could, Dad.
- I know.

105
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,739
I know.

106
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,783
I am very proud.

107
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,869
I love you very much.

108
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,423
[whispers] It's Dad. [kissing]

109
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,596
...you and your family. May he always
protect you in his holy glory.

110
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,181
Thank you very much.

111
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,308
You're great boys.

112
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,025
- Monitor the police frequencies.
- Yes.

113
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,320
And don't bother me unless it's necessary.

114
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,030
As you wish, boss.

115
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,700
Very good.

116
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,412
Very good, gentlemen.

117
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,664
Very good.

118
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,774
Please take the things out of the car
and organize them over there.

[slow Latin music plays on radio]

120
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,612
I felt I'd lost you.

121
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,616
You're never going to lose me.

122
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,954
And what now, Pablo?

123
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,831
What will we do now?

124
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:29,629
I did... what I had to do, Tata.

125
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,799
I'll take care of it.

126
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:40,139
We'll be fine, and content,

127
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:44,185
and happy, and together and united.

128
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,478

Always.

130
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,075
Always.

131
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,663
- Tell me you'll never leave me.
- Never.

132
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,999
Promise.

133
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,088
I promise.

[Steve] By morning,
word was out on the streets

142
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,799
and all eyes were on Medellín.

143
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,053
This wasn't just a manhunt...
this was an invasion.

144
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,766
Gaviria was willing to go
door to door to catch Escobar.

145
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,643
And we wanted to be a part of it.

146

After all,
we represented America down here.

147

as the guys who could get shit done.

151

Wait one moment.

- No, don't know him.

You see this?

154

to the dance.

Yeah, you mean when nothing's left inside.

158
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,395

We're going to have to move everything.

159

- What do you mean by "everything"?
- Everything. The labs...

we're moving everything.

162
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,786
They're well-guarded. There's no problem.

Come on, don't you know
what's going on at La Catedral?

164

The cops are going through all of the maps
and documents you idiots left behind.

We're... moving... everything.

168
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,432
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

169
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,142
Yes, Don Pablo.

170
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,603
We're also going to need more men.

00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,996
I'm going to need a good driver with a
clean record to drive me around the city.

175
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,794
He needs to be smart, fearless, and loyal.

176
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,214
- Done, boss.
- [Velasco] Boss, I'm sorry,

177
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,634
but you can't risk yourself like that.

178
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,178
Yes, Don Pablo, I agree with Velasco.

179
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,725
I want people to know that Pablo Escobar
doesn't hide like a rat.

180
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,814
Because we...

181
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:22,403
are the Medellín cartel, motherfucker!

182
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,280
[Steve]
Now keep in mind...

183
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,575
the Medellín cartel
wasn't just one big gang.

184
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,452
It was made up of a bunch
of smaller gangs.

185
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,288
A collective, so to speak.

186
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,333
And as far as Pablo was concerned,
he was still their leader.

187
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,504
In his mind, every trafficker in Medellín
had to pay tribute to him.

188
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,883
Only a guy who'd killed
thousands of people

189
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,803
could think Judy Moncada would forget
what he'd done to her husband Kiko

190
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,431
and his business partner Fernando Galeano,

191
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,309
the guys who were running his business
while he was inside.

192
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,687
Fuckin' psycho. He thought
that they were stealing from him...

193
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,857
and naturally,
they got the short end of the stick.

194
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,983
[Kiko]
Pablo, no!

195
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,198
[in Spanish] You believe whatever the fuck
you want to believe, you son of a bitch!

196
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,409
[Steve]
Why he thought Judy'd be okay with that...

197
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,078
Well, she wasn't.

198
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:18,292
And alongside her brother Jaime,
and head of security Diego Murillo,

199
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:23,380
a.k.a. Don Berna, they'd broken away
from the Medellín cartel.

200
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,217
And now that Pablo was out,
they wanted payback.

201
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,223
And as for the other gangs,
they were all up for grabs.

202
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,101
[man grunts, groans]

203
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,812
Take the Prisco brothers, for instance.

204
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,689
The oldest of whom, Ricardo,

205
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,108
was a respected member
of the medical community.

206
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,779
[muffled groans, yelling]

207
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,822
[man screams]

208
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,908
[Steve]
He didn't know who to side with.

209
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,327
Neither did the Gallón gang,

210
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,954
who became famous a year later

211
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,248
when they murdered Colombian soccer player
Andrés Escobar

212
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:03,003
for accidentally scoring a goal against
his own country in the 1994 World Cup.

213
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,800
But this wasn't a soccer game.
This was the blow business.

214
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:13,305
And whose side they chose would come down
to two things: who offered the better deal

215
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,641
and who had the better chance
of winning the war.

216
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,519
[Jaime speaking Spanish]
This again? Stop obsessing. Relax.

217
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,813
Relax? What do you want me to do?

218
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,941
Should I sit here and wait for Pablo
to walk through that door

219
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,152
and kill me and my daughter?
He's going to come and kill you, too.

220
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,798
- What do you think about that?
- Pablo won't be killing anyone, all right?

221
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,825
- Jaime, what country do you live in?
- [Judy chuckles]

222
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,744
If he hasn't killed anyone yet,
he's planning on it.

223
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:41,250
Haven't you noticed, Berna?
Judy, haven't you noticed?

224
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,877
Gaviria's got this city
swarming with cops.

225
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,880
There's a cop
on every fucking street corner.

226
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,925
Pablo can't move.

227
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,929
Then we have to find and kill the bastard
before the police find him.

228
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,514
[Jaime]
Judy, listen.

229
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,600
Listen to me! Listen!

230
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:03,105
Pablo, right now, it's like
he's like a caged rat. Understand?

231
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,732
Jaime.

232
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,403
Despite everything, you still don't know
what Pablo's capable of?

233
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:13,407
- He's someone we can't underestimate.
- You said it, Berna.

234
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,410
They shouldn't underestimate us either.

235
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,662
And Pablo's got very few friends left,
and you know it.

236
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,373
Pablo will always have friends.

237
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,794
Berna, I want everyone to know
what happened to Kiko.

238
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:32,259
It should be clear
that being loyal to Escobar

239
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,511
will only earn you a bullet in the head.

240
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,807
They'll know what side
they should be on, right?

241
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,184
[Berna]
Judy...

242
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,438
what do we do with the labs?

243
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,859
What do you suggest?

244
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,656
I think we shut down the labs,
at least for a while.

245
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,158
[scoffs]

246
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,996
We have to lay low
until Pablo is killed or captured.

247
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,292
That's stupid, Berna.
Tell me how that makes any sense. Huh?

248
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,088
A lot of other people also stopped
paying Pablo at the same time as us.

249
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,256
Let's join forces with them.

250
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,551
There's the Priscos, for example.
Last night I met with Ricardo.

251
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,261
I'll talk to him.

252
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,181
[Berna]
Jaime, be very careful with those people.

253
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,770
[phone ringing]

254
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,105
- Hello?
- Okay?

255
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,107
- That looks nice.
- One moment.

256
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,399
Ricardo?

257
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,738
Don Pablo.

258
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,703
Of course. There was no decision to make.

259
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,832
You know that you can always count on us.

260
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,629
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]
- [music plays nearby]

261
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,678
Sweetie! [kissing]

262
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,682
- [slaps car]
- Hey!

263
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,850
Fag!

264
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,435
What's going on, Limón?

265
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,689
- Son of a bitch.
- How's it going, brother? Good or what?

266
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:13,694
Quica, my love, come give me
the best 20 minutes of my life.

267
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,779
What are you doing here? Are you going in?

268
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,990
No, brother.
I didn't come to see the whores.

269
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,784
- Then what?
- I came to see you, brother.

270
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,244
Mmm-hmm.

271
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,499
And from what I can see,
you're still driving whores everywhere.

272
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,501
You know how it is. I have to pay rent.

273
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,714
Listen, Limón,
don't you want to make good money?

274
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,257
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm?

275
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,675
Doing what?

276
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,846
- The same thing, brother.
- Driving who?

277
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,765
Pablo Escobar, brother.

278
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:48,854
- Eat shit, you son of a bitch.
- Limón, I'm serious, brother.

279
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,983
The boss asked us to find someone...

280
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,403
someone clean, who the police don't know.

281
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,156
He would go in the trunk.

282
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:05,579
- Where would I have to take him?
- Wherever he wants to go. You don't ask.

283
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,830
Mmm.

284
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,416
What do you think, brother?

285
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,879
There's cops everywhere.

286
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,924
Why don't we put a girl in the back
so no one gets suspicious?

287
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,930
- Which one of the whores do you trust?
- They're whores, brother.

288
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,432
Then who, brother?

289
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,976
- No!
- No?

290
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,646
- Thank you.
- Why not, Maritza?

291
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,981
- No.
- Hmm? What's wrong with it? Nothing.

292
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,401
- I'm very busy, Jhon.
- That doesn't matter, Maritza.

293
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,570
- Yes?
- [Maritza sighs]

294
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,782
Ask one of the girls
you drive around all day.

295
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,659
- I can't.
- Get out of my way.

296
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,537
Maritza... I need you to do it.

297
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,582
It'll be the easiest money
you'll make in your life.

298
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,460
You can quit your second job, understand?

299
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,303
You'll be able to take care
of your daughter.

300
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,506
Haven't I always done right by you?

301
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,093
I've always helped you
and your family, right? So?

302
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,804
Right?

303
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,642
You're a son of a bitch, you know?

304
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,355
So what? Hmm?

305
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,789
[murmuring indistinctly]

306
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,877
- And who's that?
- He's a friend. He's trustworthy.

307
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,214
What's up, Quica?
This is the girl I told you about.

308
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,805
Let's go.

309
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,808
Take care, skinny!

310
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,062
[Limón] All good?
[La Quica] All good, brother.

311
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,522
[Limón]
I'll follow you, brother.

312
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,192
- Who's that bitch?
- Close your fucking legs, Rosa.

313
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,028
You'll kill all the flowers.

314
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,072
You shit-eating bastard.
This pussy smells great.

315
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,035
Now you're going to the market
to buy your whores, you bastard?

316
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,786
Don't get pissy.

317
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,081
If you're in a better mood
when I come back this afternoon,

318
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,499
you'll get to fuck me.

319
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,295
[Rosa]
Fucking Quica.

320
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,381
Shut up! Go inside! Watch yourself!

321
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,967
[Rosa mutters indistinctly]

322
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,557
[Steve] Looking for a place
for your next corporate retreat?

323
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,560
Or maybe a quiet getaway
for the whole family?

324
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:39,483
How about 360 degrees of unobstructed
views of the Antioquian countryside?

325
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,987
Sixty thousand square feet
of creative living space.

326
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,701
Perfect for entertaining.

327
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,498
Look no further than La Catedral.

328
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,666
One man's prison...

329
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,711
is anyone else's palace.

330
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,301
Yep... it was a beautiful place.

331
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,720
And when the Colombian cops
were done with it,

332
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,765
they were gracious enough
to let us pick through the leftovers.

333
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,563
This and Mein Kampf.

334
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,483
Two classics of 20th century literature.

335
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,361
Yeah, what do you think the rent's like?
I'm thinking about moving in.

336
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,570
[Javier chuckles]

337
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,618
Hey, Javi, you think the, uh... the Hague
would want a couple of these?

338
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,746
How are you not wearing rubber gloves
touching that shit, man?

339
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,874
We should take this stuff to our office.
It's better than any of the shit we got.

340
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:53,014
Fuckin' Pinzón's guys have taken
everything that's useful. There's nothing.

341
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,978
Look, I think I found something
that might help.

342
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,434
Oh, yeah?

343
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,061
What's that?

344
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,733
[laughing]

345
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,943
Wait.

346
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,664
[in Spanish]
Ready? Close your eyes.

347
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,082
That's right.

348
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,880
It's a little bunny, my love.
She's very delicate.

349
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,381
[chuckles]

350
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,467
[La Quica]
Boss?

351
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,403
Look, Don Pablo...

352
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:52,073
this is the guy
I've been telling you about, Limón.

353
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,450
He's Guarazapo's cousin.

354
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:59,581
Limón! Come here, brother. Come on!

355
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,714
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

356
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,676
Don't worry, boss.
We've known each other for a long time.

357
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,888
Besides, he's never had any run-ins
with police. He's clean.

358
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,681
And where are you from, son?

359
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,351
I was born in Envigado, sir.

360
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,394
My mother lives in the barrio
you built for us.

361
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,398
I'm very glad.

362
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,360
- What about the girl?
- [La Quica] She...

363
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,153
[Limón]
She's a friend, boss.

364
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,907
We went to school together in Envigado.
I know her very well

365
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,911
and I know where she works,
so she's someone we can trust, boss.

366
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,581
[Pablo]
Listen, Limón...

367
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,629
Do you know what it means to work for me?

368
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,131
It's an honor to work for you, Don Pablo.

369
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,052
You've done so much
for the poor in Medellín...

370
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,765
if I have to lose my life for you...

371
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,977
I will, boss.

372
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,399
All right.

373
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,321
Open the trunk.

374
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,658
- [man shouts orders in Spanish]
- [men grunting]

375
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,622
[Steve] After La Catedral,
the next stop was Carlos Holguín...

376
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,460
the old police training academy
that had been repurposed as ground zero

377
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,379
in the search for Escobar.

378
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,717
The new honcho was Colonel Pinzón,

379
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,803
the guy who was famous
for his love of Uncle Sam.

380
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,471
As a courtesy to your government,

381
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,182
I'm allowing you to participate
in this manhunt.

382
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:46,313
But... I set the limits
and all decisions rest with me.

383
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,275
If this condition is unacceptable,
take it up with the president.

384
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,610
Of course, Colonel.

385
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,446
I hope we didn't get off
on the wrong foot.

386
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,991
Not at all. Every operation
needs a well-defined hierarchy.

387
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,662
[phone rings nearby]

388
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,964
I hope this will be an adequate space
for you to do your work.

389
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,427
- What, you're talking about this? This...
- This is more than adequate.

390
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,057
- Gracias, Colonel.
- [Pinzón] Welcome.

391
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,397
Oh, wow, this is from 1962.

392
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,365
[Steve]
Like most tricks Pablo employed,

393
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:42,535
the audacity and simplicity of the taxi
was pretty damn good.

394
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:46,623
I mean, who in the hell would think
that the seventh richest man in the world

395
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,667
would be riding around in the trunk
of a piece of shit taxi?

396
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,961
[in Spanish]
Don't worry, brother. Everything's good.

397
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:56,424
As smart as it was, Pablo wasn't the
kind of guy who left anything to chance.

398
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,470
Despite his absence, he still
had a loyal following in Medellín.

399
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,055
[siren wails]

400
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,559
And a network of spotters... kids mainly.

401
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,479
And they were everywhere in the comunas.

402
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,775
The spotters could identify
which streets to take

403
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,902
and which ones to avoid.

404
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,614
[in Spanish]
All yours.

405
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,087
Where are we?

406
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,303
- What the fuck are we doing here, Jhon?
- Get down and hide.

407
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,556
- Jhon, I don't...
- Shit, Maritza,

408
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,850
I don't have time
to give you explanations.

409
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,351
Just do it, all right?

410
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,989
[trunk slams shut]

411
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,084
- [murmuring in Spanish]
- [knocking at door]

412
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,463
[knocking continues]

413
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,885
Don Pablo.

414
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,428
- [Pablo] Hello.
- Welcome.

415
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,639
Thank you. No, don't get up. Don't get up.

416
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,767
- How are you?
- [women] Very well.

417
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,393
Great, I'm very glad.

418
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,356
- Rojas.
- Don Pablo.

419
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,816
- Sir.
- How have you been?

420
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,461
Well, sir. How are you?
I wasn't expecting you.

421
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,528
- I'm well. Very well.
- Guys, please.

422
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,113
Yes, sir.

423
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,199
- Don Pablo.
- Do you want anything to drink, sir?

424
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,301
- A coffee?
- No, thank you.

425
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,745
- Can I get you anything?
- Thank you, I'm fine.

426
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,625
- [sighs] How are you?
- I'm well, sir. Everything is well.

427
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,795
- How is Maribel?
- Maribel is well, sir. Thank you.

428
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,463
Good, brother.

429
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,965
What's going on with the deposits?

430
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,206
They're looking a little light.

431
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,262
Well, after everything
that happened with...

432
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:11,184
[softly] with Mr. Galeano
and Mr. Moncada, well...

433
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,770
people are nervous, you understand?

434
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:18,566
This woman, Judy Moncada,
has been talking to people.

435
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,611
Not everyone wants to pay.

436
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,613
Mmm.

437
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,327
- So that's it?
- That's it, sir. I thought you knew.

438
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,414
- I told them to tell you...
- Calm down. Don't worry about that.

439
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,669
We'll fix that problem soon.

440
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,962
Yes, sir.

441
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,341
[softly] In the meantime...

442
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,971
I want you to move
to the offices in Laureles.

443
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,474
It's no longer safe here.

444
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,269
- Done, sir. Whatever you say.
- Good.

445
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,688
And fill this up, please.

446
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,160
[man]
Don Pablo!

447
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,162
- Sir, how are...
- Is that you?

448
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,373
- How are you, sir?
- [man] Sweetie! Sweetie!

449
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,835
Sweetie!
Don Pablo is in front of our house.

450
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,295
[woman]
Don Pablo?

451
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,231
- Don Pablo!
- [Pablo] Hello, ma'am. How are you?

452
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,673
- Fine, and you?
- I'm well.

453
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,967
- It's him, old man.
- Sir, how are you?

454
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,386
- How is your health?
- It's good. Very good!

455
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,930
Good. Good. How are all of you?
Good? Good?

456
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,599
- How are you, Don Pablo?
- Good.

457
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,100
- It's him.
- How are you?

458
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,685
- In the flesh?
- How are you, son?

459
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:39,188
- Good?
- Boss, we should get going.

460
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,983
Let them see me. Let them see me.

461
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,003
- I never thought I'd meet you in person.
- How are you?

462
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,778
I'm well, ma'am, how are you?

463
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:50,241
- Here, boss, behind you.
- Here. Let's see.

464
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,453
- Generous as always, Don Pablo.
- For you.

465
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,497
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- For the doctor, sir. For the doctor.

466
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,875
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- Take care of yourself.

467
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,170
For you, ma'am.

468
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,047
For you too, sir.

469
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,684
[line ringing]

470
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,481
[screeching]

471
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,199
- [Steve sighs]
- Seriously? Directly in front of me?

472
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,242
I don't spend enough time
looking at your face?

473
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,538
That's better.

474
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,127
[in Spanish] There's a girl on line three.
She wants to talk to an American.

475
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,548
[in English]
Nothing?

476
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:52,428
[sighs]
You picked up the "American" part, right?

477
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,640
Murphy!

478
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,977
- [in Spanish] What's wrong, brother?
- [in Spanish] Suck my dick, please.

479
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,775
- [in Spanish] DEA, Agent Peña.
- [Rosa] Pay attention.

480
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,779
I know where you can find
one of Escobar's men.

481
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,156
Oh, yeah? Which one?

482
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,243
There's a reward, right?

483
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,037
Yes, there's a reward.

484
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,165
What's your information, miss?
Who are you talking about?

485
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,586
La Quica.

486
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,757
La Quica?

487
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,927
You know La Quica?

488
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,596
He came to the brothel on 23rd street.

489
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,349
He left with a man in a taxi
and said he would return later.

490
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,102
Do you work there?

491
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,732
Yes.

492
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,900
How long ago was this?

493
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,487
A couple of hours ago.

494
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,282
All right, we'll look into it.

495
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,704
- You think it's legit?
- Let's find out.

496
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,927
How credible is your source?

497
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,681
[Javier] It was an unsolicited phone call.
She asked to speak to an American.

498
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,701
We would just need a couple of cars
and a few men.

499
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,770
[Pinzón] Well, my men are either busy here
or outside in the street.

500
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,981
And I'm not relocating men
to chase down bullshit tips.

501
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,109
If this turns out not to be bullshit,
La Quica could give us Pablo.

502
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,405
[Pinzón]
So go. Go ahead.

503
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,908
Since when do you need an excuse
to go to a whorehouse?

504
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,163
[in Spanish]
It would be worth investigating, Colonel.

505
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,415
We're not asking for a lot.

506
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,298
[in English]
One vehicle, three men.

507
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,591
Gracias.

508
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,097
[door opens, closes]

509
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,074
[Berna over phone]
Did you close the lab?

510
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,894
Jesus Christ.

511
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:08,314
No, Berna, and I won't
because it's not necessary.

512
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,985
- Listen to me, Jaime...
- No, you listen to me. Enough of this.

513
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,363
I already spoke with
Ricardo Prisco, all right?

514
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,865
He's with us. He supports us.

515
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,469
Everything is firm. Everything is good.
What more could we want?

516
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,788
I told you to be careful
with those people, Jaime.

517
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,997
Pay attention to me.

518
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,709
First, these guys have been with us
since Pablo killed Kiko, right?

519
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,462
Second, Ricardo knows
that being loyal to Pablo

520
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,172
means a bullet in the head, brother.

521
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:37,593
And third, and to ease your mind,
they're sending us men, for security...

522
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,970
What?

523
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,306
So you gave these people
the address to the lab?

524
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,184
Don't be an idiot.
How else would they get here?

525
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,437
Jaime, listen to me.

526
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,732
Get out of there now.
Get moving and come here right now!

527
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,836
Listen to me, Berna!
Stop with the paranoia, brother!

528
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,736
- [overlapping gunshots]
- [women screaming]

529
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,822
[Berna]
Jaime! Jaime! Get out now!

530
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,824
- Come here now!
- Come play, motherfuckers!

531
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,661
Jaime! Jaime!

532
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,745
Get out now!

533
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,502
What's going on, Ricardo?

534
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,423
You're fucking up, man.

535
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,593
Ricardo, put the gun down, brother.

536
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,138
Ricardo, put it down.
Pablo is weak right now, brother.

537
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,182
You know this.

538
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,601
The city's filled with cops.

539
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,979
Pablo can't move, brother.

540
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,732
Ricardo, put the gun down.

541
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,282
Hello, Jaime.

542
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,408
[phone rings]

543
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,619
Jaime.

544
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,955
- [Pablo] Berna, how have you been?
- Who's this?

545
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,919
This is Pablo speaking. I imagine
you want to talk to Jaime, right?

546
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,506
Berna, help me, man.

547
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,427
Berna, talk to Pablo.
Explain everything, Berna! Help me!

548
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,887
Pablo, no! Wait!

549
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,096
[gunshot]

550
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,933
[sighs]

551
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,939
And now, you fat son of a bitch...

552
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:18,486
we're coming after you
and that bitch you protect.

553
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,822
Pablo, you've just made
the biggest mistake.

554
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,616
Tell the others...

555
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,492
Who is it?

556
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:30,456
...that Pablo Escobar is to be respected,

557
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,166
you son of a bitch.

558
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,901
[Judy] That son of a bitch!
His entire family, do you understand?

559
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,011
I want everyone
in his fucking family dead!

560
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,389
- That fat fuck!
- [glass shatters]

561
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,308
[screaming] Son of a bitch!

562
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,811
- [sobbing]
- Listen, Judy...

563
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,483
I'm very sorry about Jaime, and I'm very
sorry about all of these deaths.

564
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:01,112
We have to accept that we lost this time.

565
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,950
But you know what?
I'll be with you until the end.

566
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:10,246
And if you want to go ahead on
against Pablo, just say so.

567
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:16,127
We'll find strong allies. And people.
We'll need a lot of people.

568
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,547
[sobs] Yes.

569
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,638
[gasps, exhales]

570
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,973
You're right.

571
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,060
[sniffles] Yes.

572
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,317
I think we have to see things
for what they are.

573
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,694
The truth of the matter, just as it is.

574
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,197
And this is the truth, Berna:

575
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,036
I know of someone who's very powerful.

576
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,373
Someone who wants to kill Pablo
as much as I do.

577
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,678
[Javier speaks English] Alleys run
along the house here... and here.

578
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,514
We'll keep the other car
waiting around back.

579
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:14,185
- [in Spanish] You sure it's not a trap?
- [in Spanish] I'm not sure of anything.

580
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,937
[phone beeping]

581
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,110
- Murphy.
- Hey, it's me.

582
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,071
Hey, honey. Um...

583
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,034
[softly] I'm just in the middle
of something. Let me call you right back.

584
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,326
We're at the airport.

585
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,162
You're where?

586
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,372
I can't do this.

587
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,875
I'm taking Olivia
and we're going back to Miami.

588
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,561
[softly]
No, no, no. Listen to me, please.

589
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,171
Please, you can't just do it like this.
You can't.

590
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:45,925
My sister's offered to help us out for
a while, so we'll be there if you need us.

591
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:46,842
Connie.

592
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,304
It's not right, Steve, to keep Olivia here
with everything that's going on.

593
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,098
Not when I can take her someplace safe.

594
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,951
You're safe in Bogotá. You're right beside
the goddamn fuckin' embassy.

595
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,375
- [woman on PA] Ladies and gentlemen...
- Look, I have to go.

596
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:01,440
Connie, please. We can talk about this.
Do not get on that airplane. Wait, okay?

597
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,876
I'll be right there. I'm on my way.

598
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,486
- I'm sorry.
- [baby whimpering]

599
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,491
[whispers]
Hey, hey, hey. I'm here. Okay?

600
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,954
- She's at the airport.
- Go.

601
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:18,332
I'm sorry. I gotta go. Guys, sorry.

602
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,085
[Javier]
All right.

603
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,552
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

604
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,787
Hello, Fernando.

605
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,043
You did very well, sister.

606
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,881
Look... you don't just get two,
you get three.

607
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:14,430
You have a special talent, and that's why
you get three instead of two green ones.

608
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:25,024
What are you doing tonight, sweetie?
I know of a nice calm place.

609
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,485
We could have fun.

610
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,906
I can't.
I have to take care of my daughter.

611
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:39,121
- Bitch. Give me 30 minutes, Limón.
- All right, brother.

612
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,249
I'm going to fuck one of them. [grunts]

613
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,629
[La Quica]
Sweetie...

614
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,216
Thank you, Maritza.

615
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,184
Bastard.

616
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,997
[indistinct chatter over PA]

617
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,713
[in Spanish]
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

618
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,717
- [in English] Flight to Miami.
- Gate 39, but... Sir, you can't go. Sir!

619
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,321
I'm DEA. I need to get on this flight.

620
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,556
I'm sorry, sir... Sir, I'm sorry,
but the plane has already left.

621
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,853
Sir, please. You can't be here.

622
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,772
Sir!

623
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,948
[Javier speaks Spanish] Right here,
to the right. It's the next right.

624
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,450
Know the area well, don't you, Peña?

625
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,411
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

626
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,204
[in English]
Just fuckin' drive.

627
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:07,251
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]
- [rap music plays inside]

628
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,464
- [woman chuckles]
- [music continues loudly]

629
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,884
[laughs]

630
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:19,138
[woman speaks Spanish over PA]

631
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,398
- [urinating]
- [man sniffs nearby]

632
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,320
- [flushing]
- [whispers] Enjoy.

633
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,498
- Get you feeling pretty good?
- Huh?

634
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,419
Oh, fuck. Thanks, man. Shit.

635
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,713
[laughs] Phew!

636
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,008
You wouldn't imagine
what a kilo of that stuff cost.

637
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,469
Come on.

638
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,221
- How about you, golden boy?
- What are you talking about, man?

639
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,850
Time it's processed, shipped,

640
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:10,939
distributed to your buddies on...
the Upper East Side? Yeah.

641
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:14,401
Hey, man, we don't need
any problems here. We cool?

642
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,327
Six.

643
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,829
Lives.

644
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,957
That's how much it cost.

645
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,751
What do you think about that?

646
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,505
That was six people.
Six people were murdered

647
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:38,092
every time you
and your buddy over there...

648
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,345
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah?

649
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,347
[grunting]

650
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,602
[Steve grunts]

651
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,689
Whoo!

652

654
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,830
[in Spanish]
Yeah? You like that? Yeah?

655
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:14,461
[in Spanish]
There's the taxi. Park on the left. There.

656
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,304
[man speaks Spanish]
Calm down! Calm down!

657
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,641
Okay, let's go.

658
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,271
[Javier]
All right. Wait for me here.

659
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,211
- Trujillo!
- Go around! Go around!

660
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,046
- Move! Move! Move!
- [women shout]

661

Move! Move! Move! [grunts]

662
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,218
Quica!

663
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,429
Brother!

664
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,514
God damn it. What?

665
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,725
- Quica! Quica!
- What's the problem, brother?

666
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,602
Let's go, brother. Hurry up!

667
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,854
[women gasping]

[clattering above]

671
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,388
They're cops, brother! Run!

672
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,569
That way.

673
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,192
Stop looking.
This is the best place to eat.

674
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,278
[panting]

675
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,739
[in English] Fuck.

676
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,742
Fuck.

677
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,083
[Fernando speaks Spanish]
The situation is that...

678
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:03,630
your escape has left us without...
We don't have a lot of options.

679
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,508
If I hadn't escaped,
they would have killed me, Fernando.

680
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,596
Or I'd rot in an American jail.

681
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:17,561
- You will tell Gaviria...
- Gaviria is being crucified by the media.

682
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,106
I don't think it's a good time.

683
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:27,070
You will tell Gaviria...

684
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:36,705
I am willing to go back to La Catedral
to finish my sentence.

685
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,332
As you wish.

686
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,419
- Tomorrow morning, I'll return to Bogotá...
- No, no, no, brother.

687
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,507
[voice straining] We can't...

688
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,513
leave for tomorrow what we can do today.
Right?

689
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,188
[dialing]

690
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,359
Mr. President,
Mr. Fernando Duque is on the line.

691
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,865
- I don't have anything to say to him.
- I'll handle it. You go ahead.

692
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,912
Mr. Duque. Eduardo Sandoval speaking.

693
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:21,041
Mr. Vice Minister, I have an important
message from Mr. Escobar.

694
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:28,006
He says he's willing to negotiate the
conditions for his return to La Catedral.

695
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,260
Turn on the television.

696
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:43,230
- What did he say?
- He told us to turn on the television.

697
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,254
[Gaviria on TV]
Good evening, compatriots.

698
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:13,760
In the last year and a half, we've
enjoyed the peace we'd long awaited...

699
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,178
for over a decade.

700
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,182
Now we can go to work,

701
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:23,937
drop our children off at school,
and enjoy life's small pleasures...

702
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:29,067
without the threat of violence
looming around every corner.

703
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:34,156
This peace is now threatened
by virtue of Pablo Escobar's escape.

704
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:40,370
Escobar has been named
the bloodiest narcoterrorist of all time.

705
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,709
This history... changes today.

706
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,755
But I need your help.

707
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:54,801
We must come together as a people,
as a country,

708
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,263
so his reign of terror comes to an end,
here and now.

709
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,976
This is why I'm before you now...

710
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:08,732
offering a reward of $1.4 million

711
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:12,486
for whoever gives information
leading to his capture.

712
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:18,283
It is my hope that through this reward...

713
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:23,538
the day will finally come when our country
is free of Pablo's grip

714
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:29,336
and will cease to be held hostage
by terror, intimidation...

715
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,297
and murder.

716
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,716
I want to make it very clear...

717
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,803
that under no circumstances...

718
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,640
will I negotiate with Pablo Escobar.

719
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,946
