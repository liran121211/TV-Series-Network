2
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:28,225
Okay. Here we go again.

3
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:32,979
Let me break it down for you,

4
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,108
four thousand soldiers...

5
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:40,320
a 250-man team of Colombia's
elite forces...

6
00:00:42,614 --> 00:00:45,200
tens of thousands of rounds fired...

7
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,497
...seven dogs...

8
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,292
...and four fuckin' helicopters.

9
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:57,921
Pablo Escobar was surrounded
in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

10
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,676
There was no way he was
getting out of this one... right?

11
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:04,340
_

12
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:06,560
_

13
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,493
_

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,899
_

15
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:19,261
_

16
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:22,023
_

17
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:24,615
_

18
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:28,035
_

19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,957
_

20
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:37,169
_

21
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:40,047
_

22
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,423
_

23
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:43,383
_

24
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:46,905
_

25
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:49,181
_

26
00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:51,600
_

27
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:09,451
_

28
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:13,247
_

29
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,749
_

30
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:27,844
_

31
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:33,100

32
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:43,443

35
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,689
Yep.

36
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,901
Life ain't fair, man.

37
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,280
Pablo Escobar? He was headed home.

38
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:56,034
As for me and Connie, well,
we were in some deep shit,

39
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:57,619
and I hadn't even heard the news.

40
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:59,955
This is what I do. This is my job.

41
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:02,374
No, don't you dare say this is your job.

42
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:04,584
I know what your fucking job is.

43
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:07,963
And it doesn't entail being kidnapped
by a Colombian drug cartel.

44
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:10,799
Listen, I'm sorry, I am. I
know it must've been tough for you.

45
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:14,845
Listen, but Connie, I was
never in any danger.

46
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:17,180
I'm here now, back with you.

47
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,183
Hmm?

48
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,772
All I want... is for us to be safe.

49
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:29,627
I want to get the hell out of this
place and I want to go home.

50
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:40,829
- Murphy.
- Escobar's out.

51
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:43,165
- What?
- He's fucking out.

52
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:44,786
He took Sandoval hostage during the

53
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:48,569
siege and when the
army went in... he escaped.

54
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:49,921
Walked right out.

55
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,305
Pick me up in ten minutes.
I'll meet you downstairs.

56
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:07,564
Escobar's escaped.

57
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:15,280
And you know what?

58
00:06:16,198 --> 00:06:18,158
I was happy about it.

59
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:22,913
The fox was out of the cage
and the hunt was on.

60
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:29,544
Yeah, it was the biggest law enforcement
blunder of all time.

61
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:32,005
Fortunately, it wasn't our blunder.

62
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:33,590

63
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:36,826

76
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:27,978

77
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:30,564

78
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:35,485

79
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:37,612

80

82
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:47,497

83
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:50,792
_

84
00:07:51,877 --> 00:07:53,003
_

85
00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:04,639
_

86
00:08:07,726 --> 00:08:08,852
_

87
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,999

88
00:08:13,023 --> 00:08:14,608

89
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:16,818

91

92

95
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,296
_

96
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:37,964

97
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,308

98
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,644
_

99
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:52,687
_

100
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:55,774
_

101
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:08,328

104

_

105
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:26,930
_

106
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:30,225
_

107
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:31,935
_

108
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:34,604
_

109
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:38,316
_

110
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:40,568
_

111
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:54,679
_

112
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:11,516
_

113
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,520
_

114
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:20,859
_

115
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:22,736
_

116
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:28,533
_

117
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,704
_

118
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:39,044
_

119
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:43,089
_

120
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:44,382
_

121
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:46,801
_

122
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:57,979
_

123
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:02,567
_

124
00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:05,904
_

125
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:10,992
_

126
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:15,955
_

127
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:41,189
Pablo Escobar has escaped from prison.

128
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:51,449
He is out of that prison again
after a bizarre showdown between...

129
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,576
By morning, word was out on the streets

130
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,703
and all eyes were on Medellín.

131
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,958
This wasn't just a
manhunt... this was an invasion.

132
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,671
Gaviria was willing to go
door to door to catch Escobar.

133
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:06,548
And we wanted to be a part of it.

134
00:12:08,424 --> 00:12:11,594
After all, we
represented America down here.

135
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:15,014
We thought of ourselves as
the guys who could get shit done.

136
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:18,017
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Jesus Christ.

137
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:22,021
Agent Murphy, Agent Peña. DEA.

138
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:25,942
_

139
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,068
_

140
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:31,030
- Name Pinzón mean anything to you?
- No, don't know him.

141
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,159
You see this?

142
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:38,430
Well, it looks like
we're not invited to the dance.

143
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:41,249
_

144
00:12:41,332 --> 00:12:44,294
_

145
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:46,537
Yeah, you mean when nothing's
left inside.

146
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,300
_

147
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:54,429
_

148
00:12:55,346 --> 00:13:01,644
_

149
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:03,730
_

150
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:06,691
_

151
00:13:06,774 --> 00:13:10,945
_

152
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:15,617
_

153
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,827
_

154
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:20,014
_ Huh?

155
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:23,875
_

156
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,337
_

157
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,047
_

158
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,507
_

159
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,928
_

160
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:39,057
_

161
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:44,646
_

162
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:49,901
_

163
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:55,698
_

164
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,300
_

165
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:02,538
_

166
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:05,083
_

167
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:10,630
_

168
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,718
_

169
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:21,307
_

170
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:23,184
Now keep in mind...

171
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:26,479
the Medellín cartel
wasn't just one big gang.

172
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:29,357
It was made up of a bunch
of smaller gangs.

173
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,192
A collective, so to speak.

174
00:14:31,276 --> 00:14:35,238
And as far as Pablo was concerned,
he was still their leader.

175
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:39,409
In his mind, every trafficker in Medellín
had to pay tribute to him.

176
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:42,787
Only a guy who'd killed
thousands of people

177
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,447
could think Judy Moncada would

178
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:46,732
forget what he'd
done to her husband Kiko

179
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,335
and his business partner
Fernando Galeano,

180
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:52,213
the guys who were running
his business while he was inside.

181
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:55,591
Fuckin' psycho. He thought
that they were stealing from him...

182
00:14:56,551 --> 00:14:58,761
and naturally, they got the
short end of the stick.

183
00:14:58,845 --> 00:14:59,887
_

184
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:07,103
_

185
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:09,314
Why he thought Judy'd
be okay with that...

186
00:15:09,397 --> 00:15:11,983
Well, she wasn't.

187
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:17,196
And alongside her brother Jaime,
and head of security Diego Murillo,

188
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,285
a.k.a. Don Berna, they'd
broken away from the Medellín cartel.

189
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:26,122
And now that Pablo was out,
they wanted payback.

190
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:32,128
And as for the other
gangs, they were all up for grabs.

191
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:37,717
Take the Prisco brothers, for instance.

192
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,594
The oldest of whom, Ricardo,

193
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:42,013
was a respected member
of the medical community.

194
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,812
He didn't know who to side with.

195
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:52,231
Neither did the Gallón gang,

196
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:53,858
who became famous a year later

197
00:15:53,941 --> 00:15:57,153
when they murdered Colombian
soccer player Andrés Escobar

198
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:01,908
for accidentally scoring a goal
against his own country in the 1994 World Cup.

199
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:06,704
But this wasn't a soccer
game. This was the blow business.

200
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:09,467
And whose side they
chose would come down

201
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:12,234
to two things, who offered
the better deal

202
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:14,545
and who had the better chance
of winning the war.

203
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:19,717

204
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:22,845
_

205
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:26,057
_

206
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,702
_

207
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:31,729
_

208
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:34,649

209
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:40,154

217
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:03,636

218
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,307

219

222
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,278

223
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:24,699

224
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:31,164

233
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,992

244
00:18:55,248 --> 00:18:56,582

245
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,586
_

246
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,754
_

247
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:04,340
_

248
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:07,593
_

249
00:19:07,677 --> 00:19:12,598
_

250
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:14,684
_

251
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,894
_

252
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:19,689
_

253
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,148
Mmm-hmm.

254
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:26,404
_

255
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:28,406

256
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,618
_

257
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:34,161
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm?

258
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:35,580
_

259
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:39,750
_

260
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:42,670

261
00:19:42,753 --> 00:19:47,758

262
00:19:47,842 --> 00:19:51,887

263
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,308

264
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,060

265
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:04,483
_

266
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:05,735
Mmm.

267
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:08,321
_

268
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:12,783
_

269
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:15,828

270
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:21,834
_

271
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:24,337
_

272
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,881
_

273
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:29,550
_

274
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:31,886
_

275
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:35,306
_

276
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:37,475
_

277
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:40,686
_

278
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,563
_

279
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:46,442
_

280
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:49,487
_

281
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,365
_

282
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:54,209
_

283
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:58,928
_

284
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:02,708
_

285
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:07,546
_

286
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:12,259
_ Hmm?

287
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:34,782
_

288
00:21:34,865 --> 00:21:38,119
_

289
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:45,710
_

290
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:48,713
_

291
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:52,967
- _
- _

292
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,427
_

293
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:58,097
_

294
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,932
_

295
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:02,977
_

296
00:22:04,186 --> 00:22:06,939
_

297
00:22:07,022 --> 00:22:08,691
_

298
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:11,986
_

299
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,404
_

300
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,199
_

301
00:22:17,283 --> 00:22:20,286
_

302
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,462
Looking for a place for your
next corporate retreat?

303
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:32,465
Or maybe a quiet getaway
for the whole family?

304
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:38,387
How about 360 degrees of
unobstructed views of the Antioquian countryside?

305
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,892
Sixty thousand square feet
of creative living space.

306
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:48,606
Perfect for entertaining.

307
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:53,402
Look no further than La Catedral.

308
00:22:54,528 --> 00:22:55,571
One man's prison...

309
00:22:56,947 --> 00:22:58,616
is anyone else's palace.

310
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,206
Yep... it was a beautiful place.

311
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:07,625
And when the Colombian
cops were done with it,

312
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,669
they were gracious enough to
let us pick through the leftovers.

313
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,468
This and Mein Kampf.

314
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,387
Two classics of 20th century literature.

315
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:23,265
Yeah, what do you think the rent's
like? I'm thinking about moving in.

316
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:30,523
Hey, Javi, you think the, uh...
the Hague would want a couple of these?

317
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:33,651
How are you not wearing rubber
gloves touching that shit, man?

318
00:23:44,578 --> 00:23:46,179
We should take this stuff to our office.

319
00:23:46,204 --> 00:23:48,044
It's better than any of the shit we got.

320
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:50,321
Fuckin' Pinzón's
guys have taken everything

321
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,943
that's useful. There's nothing.

322
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:53,882
Look, I think I found something
that might help.

323
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:55,339
Oh, yeah?

324
00:23:56,966 --> 00:23:57,800
What's that?

325
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:03,847
Wait.

326
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:16,569
_

327
00:24:17,987 --> 00:24:18,904
_

328
00:24:20,114 --> 00:24:23,784
_

329
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:28,372
_

330
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:47,308
_

331
00:24:48,017 --> 00:24:50,978
_

332
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:52,354
_

333
00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:58,485
_

334
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,619
_

335
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:10,581
_

336
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:13,792
_

337
00:25:13,876 --> 00:25:15,586
_

338
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:18,255
_

339
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:20,299
_

340
00:25:22,718 --> 00:25:24,303
_

341
00:25:25,346 --> 00:25:27,264
_

342
00:25:27,348 --> 00:25:29,058
_

343
00:25:29,975 --> 00:25:32,811
_

344
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:36,815
_

345
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:40,486
_

346
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,533
_

347
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:49,036
_

348
00:25:50,204 --> 00:25:52,956
_

349
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:57,670
_

350
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,881
_

351
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:07,179
_

352
00:26:10,683 --> 00:26:12,226
_

353
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:21,527
After La Catedral, the next
stop was Carlos Holguín...

354
00:26:22,653 --> 00:26:26,365
the old police training academy
that had been repurposed as ground zero

355
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:28,283
in the search for Escobar.

356
00:26:29,993 --> 00:26:32,621
The new honcho was Colonel Pinzón,

357
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:35,708
the guy who was famous
for his love of Uncle Sam.

358
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:37,376
As a courtesy to your government,

359
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:40,087
I'm allowing you to participate
in this manhunt.

360
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:45,217
But... I set the limits
and all decisions rest with me.

361
00:26:45,843 --> 00:26:49,179
If this condition is unacceptable,
take it up with the president.

362
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:51,515
Of course, Colonel.

363
00:26:51,598 --> 00:26:53,350
I hope we didn't get
off on the wrong foot.

364
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:56,895
Not at all. Every operation
needs a well-defined hierarchy.

365
00:27:08,449 --> 00:27:11,869
I hope this will be an
adequate space for you to do your work.

366
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,923
What, you're talking about this? This...

367
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:16,355
This is more than adequate.

368
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,961
- Gracias, Colonel.
- Welcome.

369
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:28,302
Oh, wow, this is from 1962.

370
00:27:35,058 --> 00:27:37,269
Like most tricks Pablo employed,

371
00:27:37,352 --> 00:27:41,440
the audacity and simplicity
of the taxi was pretty damn good.

372
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:45,527
I mean, who in the hell would think
that the seventh richest man in the world

373
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:48,572
would be riding around in the
trunk of a piece of shit taxi?

374
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:50,866
_

375
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:53,307
As smart as it was,
Pablo wasn't the kind

376
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:55,353
of guy who left anything to chance.

377
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,374
Despite his absence, he still
had a loyal following in Medellín.

378
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,464
And a network of spotters...
kids mainly.

379
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:08,383
And they were everywhere in the comunas.

380
00:28:09,843 --> 00:28:12,679
The spotters could identify
which streets to take

381
00:28:12,763 --> 00:28:14,807
and which ones to avoid.

382
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,519
_

383
00:28:31,782 --> 00:28:32,991
_

384
00:28:38,122 --> 00:28:41,208
_

385
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:43,460
_

386
00:28:43,544 --> 00:28:47,256
_

387
00:29:19,288 --> 00:29:20,789
_

388
00:29:20,873 --> 00:29:22,332
_

389
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:25,544
_

390
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:27,671
_

391
00:29:27,754 --> 00:29:29,298
_

392
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:34,261
_

393
00:29:34,344 --> 00:29:35,721
_

394
00:29:35,804 --> 00:29:37,365

Seriously? Directly in front of me?

444
00:32:30,187 --> 00:32:32,147
I don't spend enough time
looking at your face?

445
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:36,443
That's better.

446
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:42,032

447
00:32:45,035 --> 00:32:46,453
Nothing?

448
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,333
You picked up the "American"
part, right?

449
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:54,544
Murphy!

467
00:33:56,022 --> 00:33:58,608
- You think it's legit?
- Let's find out.

468
00:34:11,955 --> 00:34:13,832
How credible is your source?

469
00:34:13,915 --> 00:34:15,656
It was an unsolicited phone call.

470
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,610
She asked to speak to an American.

471
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:19,605
We would just need a
couple of cars and a few men.

472
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:22,674
Well, my men are either busy
here or outside in the street.

473
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:25,886
And I'm not relocating men
to chase down bullshit tips.

474
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:29,014
If this turns out not to be bullshit,
La Quica could give us Pablo.

475
00:34:30,974 --> 00:34:33,310
So go. Go ahead.

476
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:35,812
Since when do you need an excuse
to go to a whorehouse?

477
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:41,067
_

478
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:43,320
_

479
00:34:49,242 --> 00:34:51,203
One vehicle, three men.

480
00:34:51,286 --> 00:34:52,496
Gracias.

481
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:01,979

Alleys run along the
house here... and here.

545
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:09,419
We'll keep the other car
waiting around back.

546
00:39:09,502 --> 00:39:13,089
_

547
00:39:19,387 --> 00:39:22,015
- Murphy.
- Hey, it's me.

548
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,975
Hey, honey. Um...

549
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:26,939
I'm just in the middle of something.
Let me call you right back.

550
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:29,230
We're at the airport.

551
00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:32,066
You're where?

552
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,276
I can't do this.

553
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:36,780
I'm taking Olivia and we're
going back to Miami.

554
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:38,466
No, no, no. Listen to me, please.

555
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,075
Please, you can't just
do it like this. You can't.

556
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:44,829
My sister's offered to help us out for
a while, so we'll be there if you need us.

557
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:45,747
Connie.

558
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:49,209
It's not right, Steve, to keep
Olivia here with everything that's going on.

559
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:51,002
Not when I can take her someplace safe.

560
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:53,856
You're safe in Bogotá. You're
right beside the goddamn fuckin' embassy.

561
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,280
Look, I have to go.

562
00:39:56,341 --> 00:40:00,345
Connie, please. We can talk about this.
Do not get on that airplane. Wait, okay?

563
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:01,781
I'll be right there. I'm on my way.

564
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:04,390
I'm sorry.

565
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:09,395
Hey, hey, hey. I'm here. Okay?

566
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:13,858
- She's at the airport.
- Go.

567
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:17,237
I'm sorry. I gotta go. Guys, sorry.

568
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:19,989
All right.

569
00:40:54,482 --> 00:40:55,692

_

582
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:29,729
Flight to Miami.

583
00:42:29,754 --> 00:42:32,646
Gate 39, but... Sir, you can't go. Sir!

584
00:42:32,705 --> 00:42:34,226
I'm DEA. I need to get on this flight.

585
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,460
I'm sorry, sir... Sir, I'm
sorry, but the plane has already left.

586
00:42:41,923 --> 00:42:43,758
Sir, please. You can't be here.

587
00:42:44,592 --> 00:42:45,677
Sir!

588
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,852

589
00:42:54,936 --> 00:42:57,355

_

591
00:42:59,399 --> 00:43:01,109
Just fuckin' drive.

592
00:43:31,472 --> 00:43:33,224
Enjoy.

593
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:45,403
- Get you feeling pretty good?
- Huh?

594
00:43:46,946 --> 00:43:49,323
Oh, fuck. Thanks, man. Shit.

595
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:51,617
Phew!

596
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:54,912
You wouldn't imagine what
a kilo of that stuff cost.

597
00:43:56,164 --> 00:43:57,373
Come on.

598
00:43:57,457 --> 00:44:00,126
- How about you, golden boy?
- What are you talking about, man?

599
00:44:01,044 --> 00:44:03,755
Time it's processed, shipped,

600
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:09,844
distributed to your buddies on...
the Upper East Side? Yeah.

601
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:13,306
Hey, man, we don't need
any problems here. We cool?

602
00:44:20,897 --> 00:44:22,231
Six.

603
00:44:23,274 --> 00:44:24,734
Lives.

604
00:44:26,569 --> 00:44:27,862
That's how much it cost.

605
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:29,655
What do you think about that?

606
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:33,409
That was six people.
Six people were murdered

607
00:44:33,493 --> 00:44:36,996
every time you and your
buddy over there...

608
00:44:37,872 --> 00:44:40,249
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah?

609
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,594
