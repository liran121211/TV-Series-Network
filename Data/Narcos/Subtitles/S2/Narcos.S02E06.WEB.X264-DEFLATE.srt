1
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,885
Bastard.

2
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,976
- Let's make a bet. I'm for the boss.
- I'm betting on the boss, too.

3
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,729
This one is going to be easy.
They always let the boss win.

4
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:06,483
That's true, but if someone's going
to beat him, it's this guy.

5
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,909
Tell me something. Are you a pussy?

6
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,334
Son of a bitch.

7
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,429
- What's going on?
- You're a little slow, son.

8
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,976
Careful, son, careful!
Keep looking forward, son!

9
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,946
Oh, shit!

10
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,907
All right, boys,
start getting that money out.

11
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,044
...eighty. I'm missing 20.

12
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,130
Looks like you won some money, eh?

13
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,340
Of course, we're enjoying ourselves, boss.

14
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,675
Very good, son.

15
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:18,429
- Very good.
- What? Did he get pissed?

16
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,806
Hey.

17
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,685
Do you know why you won?

18
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:30,358
That little trick. The same one, right?

19
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,319
Don't be an idiot.
You know why you lost, Pablo?

20
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,529
- Why?
- Hmm?

21
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:39,117
Because you're a very smart guy,
but you're too stubborn. You understand?

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,496
What I understand is I don't like to lose.
Especially because of tricks.

23
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,541
- Someone had to teach you how to lose.
- Yeah, why?

24
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,296
- Very well, you son of a bitch.
- Boss?

25
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,633
- A photo?
- Sure, but not with that pansy.

26
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:00,221
No, no, no, no. You go over there.
Over there, motherfucker.

27
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,931
Cousin, cousin, cousin, cousin.

28
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,018
It's because he doesn't know
how to lose, but that's fine.

29
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,520
- Where are we headed, guys?
- To the whores!

30
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,907
Look how they left this place.

31
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:27,582
We found both the guards.
Stuffed into a trunk, burned alive.

32
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,126
Did anybody see anything?

33
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,590
We're sending spotters out, but...
they either come back with nothing or...

34
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,384
- Or what?
- Or they don't come back.

35
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,435
That bitch Judy Moncada did this.

36
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,065
But she couldn't do this alone.
No fucking way.

37
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,484
The guys that came at me
had high-end weapons.

38
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,236
Big ones.

39
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,280
Gringo shit.

40
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,874
The Cali cartel.

41
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,711
I fucking know it.

42
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,174
Those sons of bitches will regret it.

43
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:23,263
I will personally burn that fucking city
to the ground.

44
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,847
We don't know that Pablo.

45
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,686
Until we know who did it, we can't attack
the Cali cartel. It would be a mistake.

46
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,199
Get whoever we can out on the street.
Give them cash.

47
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,245
And if anyone needs more persuasion,
motivate them.

48
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:53,918
Put the word out. We're going to kill
all the bastards who did this.

49
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,462
I know I hit one of them.

50
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,008
Let's hope he's still breathing.

51
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,552
Because then...

52
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:11,352
we can find out who that son of a bitch
is working for.

53
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:02,171
Colombia is a Catholic country,
so Christmas is a big deal.

54
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,466
But the people of Medellín
always take it to the next level.

55
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,471
And despite the manhunt for Pablo going on
around them, this year was no different.

56
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:14,183
Call it faith, optimism, or stubbornness,

57
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,645
the people of Medellín thought
they'd seen it all, but they hadn't.

58
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,273
In fact, they hadn't seen anything yet.

59
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,618
PABLO MERRY CHRISTMAS
LOS PEPES

60
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,205
HAPPY HOLIDAYS

61
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,000
Medellín was about to get a show
they would never forget.

62
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,376
Good day.

63
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,007
In a letter sent to the media, a group
that identifies itself as "Los Pepes,"

64
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,677
an acronym for
"People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar."

65
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,555
...or
"People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar,"

66
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:57,351
the vigilantes waging war on those
associated with the notorious drug lord.

67
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:03,608
Mr. President, the media
is asking for a comment on Los Pepes.

68
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,569
It's only a matter of time
before it's made public.

69
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,529
Acknowledgment isn't the same
as condemning.

70
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:14,035
Sooner or later, you'll have to make
an official public statement.

71
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,996
They're doing God's work
as far as I'm concerned.

72
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,709
- That can't be our official position.
- It can be our official position...

73
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,130
Gentlemen!

74
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,803
Los Pepes is a vigilante death squad.

75
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,765
We'll take care of them
when the time comes.

76
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,102
But for now, let's focus
on our own efforts to catch Escobar.

77
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,315
I believe that's proven
a big enough job for all of us.

78
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:49,320
Communications picked up
conversations in the Manrique district

79
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:54,909
between Jairo, who is one of Escobar's
sicarios, and his mother, who is ill.

80
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,829
We know Jairo is her only child
and likely to visit her.

81
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,626
We'll continue to monitor the frequencies
for further information.

82
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,127
One more thing.

83
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,756
I don't have to tell you that there's
another group now operating in Medellín,

84
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,759
combating Escobar: Los Pepes.

85
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,344
Let me be very clear.

86
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:21,852
There must and will be a clear line
between them and us.

87
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,729
- Understood?
- Yes, Colonel.

88
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,481
Dismissed, thank you.

89
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,111
So Los Pepes
is an interesting new wrinkle.

90
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:35,616
Well, are you surprised?
Escobar's got a lot of enemies.

91
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,579
I heard from Messina this morning.
There's a lot of eyes on them and us,

92
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,206
so she wants us to steer clear.

93
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,420
- Are you working for Los Pepes, Murphy?
- No, I'm not.

94
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,590
Then I guess we're good.

95
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,572
CNP's been busy with wiretaps.

96
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,409
They picked up chatter
from Jairo's mom here... and here.

97
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:25,291
Search Bloc won't be able to move until
they get corroboration he's in the area.

98
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,460
Which could take days.

99
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:31,922
Even longer... for them to find the house.

100
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,137
I think... Jairo is planning a homecoming.

101
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,306
Maybe even today.

102
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,064
I'll see what I can find out
on the streets.

103
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,573
- Hello?
- Listen up, Carlos.

104
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,826
I have information that Jairo
is going to his mother's.

105
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,579
For Los Pepes, it was easy.

106
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,499
They had all the man-on-the-street
intelligence they needed.

107
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:11,253
If they'd heard a guy, take Jairo
for example, was in a certain vicinity,

108
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,839
they just asked around
and they'd find him.

109
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,343
But for us, well,
we had to go door-to-door,

110
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,721
asking for help from people
who don't tell cops shit.

111
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,432
- Police. Can you open up?
- What do you need?

112
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,059
Open up. Hurry. Hurry.

113
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,104
Los Pepes, on the other hand,
had no problems.

114
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,106
They were quite persuasive.

115
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,278
Sure, once in a while,
we got lucky and picked somebody up.

116
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,656
But it was rarely the guy
we were looking for.

117
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,119
Shh! Don't make me kill you
in front of your mother.

118
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,412
Don't touch her!

119
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,747
Relax, mother, relax.

120
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,291
It was slow-going.

121
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,254
If you don't
cooperate, we can't find your son.

122
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,174
But I don't know where he is.
I didn't notice anything.

123
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,552
Do you have enemies here
in the neighborhood?

124
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,596
I don't know.
It was my fault that he was here.

125
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,056
He came to see his mother...

126
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,600
We're too late. Says they already got him.

127
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:17,862
We finally get corroboration on Jairo,
Martinez orders the raid...

128
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,865
So?

129
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,826
Well, so, how does Los Pepes
get here first?

130
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,997
Maybe he got followed.

131
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,460
Or the dumb fuck shot his mouth off
and somebody else got lucky.

132
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,337
Mmm. That's it?
That's all you got to say on that?

133
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,798
Yeah.

134
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,472
If it worries you, look into it.

135
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,476
"Look into it"? Right.

136
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,355
Nobody was looking into it.
Why would they?

137
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,525
Pablo's crew was turning up dead
all over Medellín,

138
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,861
and Jairo became the latest victim.

139
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,322
The terror that Pablo had spread
across the country

140
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:05,993
was finally back on him tenfold.
Los Pepes' method was working.

141
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,412
And you better believe
it was getting to Escobar.

142
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,122
IN DEFENSE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE

143
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,500
What did you ask Santa for?

144
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,251
- A game.
- Which one?

145
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,671
- The Joker game.
- You think he'll bring it to you?

146
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,006
Dad?

147
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,051
Santa is going to bring me
the Joker game, right?

148
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,722
Dad? Dad?

149
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,474
Pablo, my love?

150
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,187
Of course, Santa will bring you
everything you want, like always.

151
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,272
Christmas without Christ.

152
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,903
Pablo.

153
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,616
I'm planning on going to
the advent service tomorrow with the kids.

154
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,952
What? No.
No one should leave this house.

155
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,538
I'm sure the kids would love
to see the lights, Pablo.

156
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,748
The children are staying here
and so are you.

157
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,084
Remember the first time
you saw the fireworks?

158
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,754
My love, can you tell your mother
she can't take the children to Medellín?

159
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,131
Mama, it's best for us to stay here.

160
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,300
It's been a month
since I've gone to church.

161
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,345
I'm sure that God
can hear your prayers from here.

162
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,555
Don Pablo.

163
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,899
Boss, they killed three more of our men.

164
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,735
They found Jairo dead next to the river.

165
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:27,241
Look, it's the Baccarat Crystal.

166
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,326
- Thank you.
- Oh!

167
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,955
- That's also Baccarat Crystal.
- Feel the weight. Look...

168
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,419
You can feel it's Baccarat.
This is from the Lloredas, right?

169
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,920
How's it going, my love?

170
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,798
My love, look at what
the Lloredas brought.

171
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:47,678
- Look, there's two.
- The Lloredas always treat us well...

172
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,975
NEW DEATH SQUAD IN MEDELLIN

173
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,229
As gratifying as these displays may feel,

174
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,940
I'm not comfortable with these signs.

175
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,360
They invite too much attention
and will lead to questions.

176
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:08,115
Our objective is to eliminate Escobar
as efficiently and discreetly as possible.

177
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,700
Without a doubt.

178
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,920
No more proclamations or manifestos
or letters to the media.

179
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,172
What about Miami?

180
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,635
We buy time.

181
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,346
Let him think he still has control.

182
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,973
Until the moment we take it from him.

183
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,566
- New intel from the embassy.
- Thank you.

184
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,493
Centra Spike
give us anything good for Christmas?

185
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,329
Well, Blackie's been getting calls
from Envigado.

186
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,666
The son of a bitch has got a girlfriend.

187
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,965
Here, I'll give that to Martinez.
I'm sure it's gotta get vetted.

188
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,800
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

189
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,896
What do you have for me?

190
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,314
I got something new.

191
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,902
- Blackie.
- I like the way this is going, Javier.

192
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,864
He's got a girlfriend. She's pregnant,
keeps calling. They're vetting it now.

193
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,660
It'll take a while.
Blackie's going to show.

194
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,412
It's done.

195
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,249
I didn't know how Los Pepes
was beating us to the punch.

196
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,419
Not yet anyway.
What I did know was that if Search Bloc

197
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,463
was gonna have any kind of impact
on the hunt for Pablo,

198
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,757
we'd have to play the game
better and faster.

199
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,469
All right, Blackie's had a girlfriend
in Envigado for a while.

200
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,887
According to Centra Spike,

201
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,766
the last known intercept
places her somewhere in this vicinity.

202
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,477
Yeah. And how's that relevant?

203
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,354
Intel says she's pregnant.

204
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,358
I know protocol is to vet intel,
wait for corroboration,

205
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,736
but I feel this one in my gut, sir.

206
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,654
Blackie's gonna show.

207
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:14,533
Los Pepes keeps getting the jump on us,
sicarios are gonna keep winding up dead.

208
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,493
This way, we get to Blackie first,

209
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,455
bring that son of a bitch in
and get something out of him.

210
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:29,089
Well, we could set up a perimeter.
No one walks in or out.

211
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,050
Collapse that perimeter house by house.

212
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,302
- Yeah.
- Sounds good to me.

213
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,893
Almighty Holy Child
of Atocha. Carmelita, help me please.

214
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,519
Don't fight with me anymore.

215
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,065
I'm going to tell you two things:
First, relax.

216
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,067
That's harmful for you and the baby.

217
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,528
Second, for the love of God,
take the money.

218
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,905
I'll find more later.

219
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,283
It's not for you or me, it's for the baby,
please understand.

220
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,286
Try to understand me.
I don't want your money.

221
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,663
I want you to be with me
and the baby, that's it.

222
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,626
Stop being stupid, girl.
We need that money.

223
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,269
- Listen to your dad.
- I don't know what's wrong with this girl.

224
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,130
She's stubborn.

225
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,758
- Hey!
- Hey.

226
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,009
What's going on?

227
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,887
Martinez gave the green light
to go after Blackie.

228
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,350
- It's a good thing, right?
- Yeah. Right.

229
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,394
Goddamn Christmas miracle.

230
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,249
Post three is in position.

231
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,794
Yes, sir, we'll be there in five minutes.

232
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,056
Wait, Javier.

233
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,647
We're moving in. Let's go.

234
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:18,574
Talk to me. We're just getting here.

235
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,367
Copy that, we're leaving now.

236
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,786
It was Berna.
The streets are full of Search Bloc.

237
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,373
All right, boys, the hunt is over for now.
Let's get out of here.

238
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,214
- What's going on?
- Nothing, sir.

239
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,551
We're conducting a police operation.
All good?

240
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,013
Let him through.

241
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:49,980
Keep calm, guys.
Hide your weapons while we handle this.

242
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,690
Let him through.

243
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,910
Good evening, what can I do for you?

244
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:07,956
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I need to see some form of ID, please.

245
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,833
Of course, with pleasure.

246
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,463
How's this for an ID?

247
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:27,059
Get out of the car and put your hands
where I can see them.

248
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,102
Quickly.

249
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,773
Boy, come over here.

250
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:37,444
- Colonel. Situation at checkpoint 20.
- What's going on?

251
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,714
- Armed men attempting to pass through.
- Checkpoint 20?

252
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,906
That's correct, sir.

253
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,786
- All units move to position 20.
- Understood.

254
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,372
All units to position 20. Move!

255
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,583
- What's going on?
- Some shit's going down at checkpoint.

256
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,967
My love, you have to take the money.

257
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,844
Blackie! Blackie. The cops are here.

258
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,973
Take care of the baby!
Take care, Carmelita!

259
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:11,478
We're both on the same team here.
What's the problem?

260
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:16,358
Stay where you are!
Hands where I can see them.

261
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,280
Relax, relax.

262
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,574
Want to see my ID?

263
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,161
- Take it out slowly.
- Okay.

264
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,676
You point a gun at me, motherfucker?

265
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,720
Do me a favor.

266
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,557
Move those cars because
we're not playing Cops and Robbers here.

267
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,976
What the fuck is this?

268
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,104
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

269
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,566
Relax! Relax! Relax! Relax!

270
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,401
Disarm. Disarm!

271
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,070
- No, you disarm!
- Sir...

272
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,323
Lower your firearm!

273
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,785
- Put the fucking gun down!
- Easy! Easy!

274
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,538
Okay, tough guys. Bravo!

275
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,539
Bravo!

276
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,170
Bravo, yes, we know it.
We all want Escobar.

277
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,297
But let us do the fucking job.

278
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,260
What? You want to
kill each other at a checkpoint?

279
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,930
Lower your weapon. Lower it.

280
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,267
Lower it.

281
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,778
Okay. These dreamers
think they're helping.

282
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,323
- Are you okay? Yeah? Everything okay?
- Yes, sir.

283
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,118
Okay. Let's go home alive.

284
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,037
- Okay?
- Okay.

285
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,455
- Let them pass.
- Okay.

286
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,543
Well then, thank you.

287
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,471
Trying to avoid a bloodbath, brother.

288
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,484
What happened? Everything okay? Yes?

289
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,944
Yes, sir.

290
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,113
Miss, we need your cooperation.

291
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,241
Tell us where Blackie is.
Where do we find him?

292
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,034
I told you. I haven't seen him.

293
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,328
Don't be afraid. We don't want you.

294
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:36,206
We want your boyfriend, Blackie.

295
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,876
Sir, I told you,
I don't know where he's at.

296
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,420
That bastard has not come around
in a long time.

297
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,924
If you want, let's go to the station.
But I told you, I don't know where he is.

298
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,717
So please leave my house.

299
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,929
They were eight, maybe ten.

300
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,350
How did they take your firearm?

301
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,983
I don't know, he just took it. Sorry.

302
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:09,239
Next time, might as well
put the gun to your own head.

303
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,574
It's easier.

304
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,802
When were you gonna tell me
about your new friend Carlos Castaño?

305
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:40,854
He's not a friend, he's a...
he's a man with a shared interest.

306
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,315
Jesus Christ.
I hope you know what you're doing.

307
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,650
Don't worry.
It's not gonna blow back on you.

308
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,195
- No, it's not me I'm worried about.
- I can handle it.

309
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,158
These aren't the guys
you wanna be messing with.

310
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,663
They're gonna do what they're gonna do
with or without me, right?

311
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:03,919
At least this way...
I'm on the inside and I can control it.

312
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,798
- Make sure it doesn't go too far.
- So that doesn't go too far?

313
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,343
The good guys, they got guns
pointing at their fucking head

314
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,471
- and the bad guys get away with it?
- Who are the good guys, Steve?

315
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,431
That's us?

316
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,655
Mr. President, these men, the Castaños,

317
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,075
I've seen their tactics firsthand
in the jungle against the FARC.

318
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:40,038
Their method of war is murder.
I think this is only the beginning.

319
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,749
And it will get even worse.

320
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,460
Colonel, I understand your concern.

321
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:49,172
It's strange. They usually operate
against the guerrillas

322
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,801
but now they're operating
against the narcos.

323
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,429
Hugo, my cabinet is still evaluating
the best course of action

324
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,139
with regard to Los Pepes.

325
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:04,562
Sir, I'd like your permission
to engage them.

326
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:09,943
No. The greatest service we can do
for this nation is capture Escobar.

327
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,362
That's what we must focus on, Colonel.

328
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,489
It's our priority.

329
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:18,076
I understand. Thank you, sir.

330
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,460
Los Pepes may have
seemed to be running the board,

331
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,921
but Escobar still had a trick or two
up his sleeve.

332
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,341
Remember I told you Ricardo Prisco
was a licensed doctor?

333
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,010
Well, he was.

334
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:39,806
And as such, he had privileges
at just about every hospital in Medellín.

335
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,601
Including the one where the Los Pepes
gunman he shot was recovering.

336
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,731
Unfortunately for that guy,
Dr. Prisco paid him a visit.

337
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,066
Let's take a look at this injury.

338
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,656
Oh... very good.

339
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,494
Shh!

340
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,959
This is going to hurt.
Tell me who you work for.

341
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,004
The Castaños.

342
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,382
Mmm.

343
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,051
The Castaños.

344
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,765
What could have brought them
out of the jungle?

345
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,936
I say it was money.

346
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,191
More money than Judy Moncada can find.

347
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,902
Pablo.

348
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,990
Now is not the time
to take on more problems, brother.

349
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,206
The Cali cartel thinks
they're immune to attack.

350
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,625
This can't go unanswered.

351
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,127
Go.

352
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,771
Maria.

353
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,817
Carlos, you scared me.

354
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,542
Tata, you have to do it now.
Pablo's gone mad.

355
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,461
With everything he's planning,
there will be consequences.

356
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,630
You and the kids
need to separate from him.

357
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,465
No, Carlos.

358
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,179
Tata, my God, listen to me.

359
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,141
There's a fearlessness to Los Pepes
that I've never seen.

360
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,269
The public declarations,
the open displays.

361
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,813
They won't stop until he's dead.

362
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:55,775
I know that, Carlos.
I've known for a long time now.

363
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,028
You know what's the only thought
on my mind?

364
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,698
That this is the last time...

365
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,744
the last time
I'll look at my husband's face.

366
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,080
The last time
I'll feel his arms around me.

367
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,500
The last time I'll see him play
with our children.

368
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,087
I automatically push that idea
out of my mind.

369
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,922
And now? Hmm?

370
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,429
Now I know, Carlos, that wherever I go...

371
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,766
I'll always be Pablo Escobar's wife.

372
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,770
My children will always
be Pablo Escobar's children.

373
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,939
Even if we lived in exile with him.

374
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,486
But without him?

375
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,738
No.

376
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,410
Okay. Okay.

377
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,162
Let's do something.

378
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:53,291
If we talk to him,
maybe he'll reconsider leaving with us.

379
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,796
I've had a good life.

380
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,966
Did you ever imagine we'd have all this?

381
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:23,279
When my niece was growing up,
she didn't think this day would come.

382
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,241
She was so skinny.

383
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,828
- She wore glasses and had braces.
- Yes.

384
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:34,165
When she was 12,
she thought her life was over.

385
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,545
I told her to wait and be patient.

386
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:43,132
Someday her beauty on the outside
would match her beauty within.

387
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,427
You have never looked more beautiful
than you do tonight.

388
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,139
Cheers to the family.

389
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,935
To Marta and Diego! Cheers!

390
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,938
Cheers!

391
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,831
Wait!

392
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,626
Wait! Wait!

393
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:21,648
Ma! Papa! Papa!

394
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,903
- I'm here, my love.
- Mom!

395
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,250
That man...

396
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,840
has no decency.

397
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,848
To attack my family like this...

398
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,228
my daughter...

399
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,523
on the night of her wedding...

400
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,861
Only a madman would do that.

401
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:15,243
A crazed animal, dangerous.

402
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,498
I want him dead.

403
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,543
Not next year. Right now.

404
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,254
Kill all of them.

405
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,967
I don't just want you to kill his lawyers,
accountants and bankers...

406
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,053
I want you to kill his secretaries...

407
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,976
anyone who lifted a finger
to help that man.

408
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,894
I want to see them dead.

409
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:47,275
Anyone who has ever licked a postage stamp
and put it on an envelope in his name,

410
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,485
I want to see them dead!

411
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:55,491
And then I want you to find anyone who
ever shook his hand and kill them too!

412
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,580
That son of a bitch.

413
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:08,629
From this night, we'll show no mercy.

414
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,100
Gilberto?

415
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,520
Gilberto, Miguel and Pacho survived, boss.

416
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,939
That'll be all, Quica.

417
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,274
Thank you, boss.

418
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,367
Pablo?

419
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,872
I'm worried about Tata.

420
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,626
I think you should let her travel.
She'll be safer.

421
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,796
What you're doing will have consequences.

422
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,549
That's why they're here. Right?

423
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,928
That's why they're here with me,
to be safe.

424
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,889
- Cali is going to want payback for...
- I know...

425
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,351
who my enemies are, Carlos.

426
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,271
And I can fight them all.

427
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,606
I know that.

428
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,901
But if Tata and the children
are out of the country,

429
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,028
you'd be free to wage this war
with no holds barred.

430
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,992
Let me ask you something.

431
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,380
- Why are you here?
- Pablo...

432
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,840
For Tata.

433
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,634
Right?

434
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,347
To make her happier.

435
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:47,562
To help her be more comfortable
with the life we're being forced to lead.

436
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,441
Have you done that?

437
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,155
Pablo, my sister is terrified.
And you can't see that...

438
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:03,411
Your sister is a lot tougher
than you think.

439
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:09,000
My wife... and my children...

440
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,711
stay with me.

441
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,479
Hello.

442
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,190
Did you see this?

443
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,776
Reports of a massive bombing
in Cali last night.

444
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,196
Gilberto Rodríguez's daughter's wedding?

445
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,031
I know of only one person in Colombia

446
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,283
with the balls big enough
to go after that guy.

447
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,076
Yeah, Pablo Escobar.

448
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,870
He had to have had a damn good reason.

449
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,874
I'd like to shift some of our resources
from Medellín to Cali.

450
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,959
Now's a bad time to deviate from Medellín.

451
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,462
Cali is trafficking
in the billions right now.

452
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,089
- If they get a free head start...
- You're not wrong.

453
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,425
But you're thinking about this
too logically.

454
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,512
The best thing for you right now
is to keep your head in the game.

455
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:07,308
Because right now,
the game is Pablo Escobar.

456
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,104
Right. Escobar.

457
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,524
I'll see you at the party tonight.

458
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,029
We could all use a few hours' break
from this shit.

459
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,115
I'll see you there.

460
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,710
Manuel.

461
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,172
Ma'am?

462
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,008
Take me to Mass.

463
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:45,596
- But the boss said we couldn't.
- Pablo worries too much.

464
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,473
Besides, you work for me.

465
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:58,025
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

466
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:04,907
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth, as it is in heaven.

467
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:10,454
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

468
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:14,500
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

469
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,632
Welcome, Mr. President.

470
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,219
Welcome, Ma'am.

471
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,850
Yeah, Bogotá is beautiful. It's a lot more
like an American city than I thought.

472
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,435
I didn't know it'd be so cold.

473
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,061
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.

474
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:42,653
It's shameful for the country
to stand by while a group of mercenaries

475
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,907
distributes its version
of perverse justice.

476
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,119
It makes all of us look bad.

477
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:54,332
- Including the president.
- Especially the president.

478
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:58,753
If he continues to allow Los Pepes
to do the dirty work,

479
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,421
which is his responsibility...

480
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,594
Colombia will never forgive him.

481
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,237
MERRY CHRISTMAS

482
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,177
Mr. President.

483
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,599
Lovely party, Ambassador.

484
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,895
It's nice we can pretend
we're all friends.

485
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:02,274
Believe it or not, the State Department
does the guest list, not me.

486
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:06,654
I can't wait to tell them
that he wants us to legalize drugs.

487
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,159
He thinks I should
publicly condemn Los Pepes.

488
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,455
They're criminals.
Their activities cannot be condoned.

489
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:21,043
Even if one does approve of the results.

490
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,173
Mr. President, I'm no one to bullshit.

491
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,467
Maybe that's hurt me in my career.

492
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,096
Yes, Los Pepes are an ugly business.

493
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,600
They're getting to Escobar.

494
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,520
That's all that matters at the present.

495
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:46,485
If I condemn them, I have to police them.

496
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:52,491
With politics and war...
the trick is in the timing.

497
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:57,830
Watch how they evolve,
how their actions are received.

498
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:03,002
And, uh, up till then,
pretend they don't exist.

499
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,796
Well, we can if you can.

500
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,901
What are you up to in here?
Have a drink.

501
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,988
Thanks. Saved me a trip to the bar.

502
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,949
Call it inter-agency cooperation.

503
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:38,871
Hmm. That's a joke. And it's funny.

504
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,210
Cheers. So where are you from, Bill?

505
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,504
Originally, Oregon.

506
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,507
You were in Afghanistan, right?

507
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,135
Well, I could tell you that
but then I'd have to...

508
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,179
Funny.

509
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,478
I know Bill Haler.
He was our guy in Afghanistan.

510
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:06,607
Oh, yeah. DEA Bill, we used to call him.

511
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,276
I liked him. Stayed in his lane.

512
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,157
So, as I'm sure you know,

513
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:19,620
I recently asked for a resource redirect
into some emerging players

514
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,121
in the trafficking world.

515
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,791
A group based in Cali. Ring a bell?

516
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,419
- We're not gonna talk about work, are we?
- My request was denied, Bill.

517
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:31,423
- We were just getting to know each other.
- So I spoke to DEA Bill.

518
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,425
- He's in Washington now.
- You don't say.

519
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:37,805
And he told me the roadblock
was caused by the agency.

520
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,975
Something about an ongoing operation.

521
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:45,396
He actually said,
"That sounds like CIA Bill."

522
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:50,276
Look, I don't care what you do
with the commies and the paramilitaries.

523
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:57,866
But as soon as your ongoing operations
involve narcos... you're in my backyard.

524
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,144
Where were you?

525
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,896
- I went to church.
- I told you it wasn't safe.

526
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,358
And I told you that it would be fine.
And look, everything's fine.

527
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,694
How could you put the children's lives
at risk?

528
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,863
No one here is in danger.

529
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:40,242
I'm surprised at you, Pablo.
This one has always been nervous, but you?

530
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,952
Don't talk that way to my husband.

531
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:46,790
I can talk to him however I want.
I don't know why everyone is...

532
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,718
Take Tata and the kids!

533
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,012
You, cover my mother!

534
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,900
Juan Pablo! Juan Pablo!
Put your coat on, quick! Put your coat on.

535
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,569
Come here, Manuela. Let's go, Pablo!

536
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,446
This way! Run!

537
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,990
Run! Run!

538
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,327
Run quickly!

539
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,747
Quickly!

540
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,501
- Pablo!
- Get out! Get out! Get out!

541
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,461
Carlos, let's go!

542
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,589
Run, Limón, run!

543
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,716
Let's go! Outside!

544
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,178
- Come on, Tata, come on.
- Get him in the car. Get him inside!

545
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,807
- Quickly! Let's go!
- Quickly!

546
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,183
Give me the girl.

547
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,019
Get in, Tata, get in.

548
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,188
Come on, brother. Go! Cover that side!

549
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,481
Move!

550
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,881
They're in the house!
Let's go! Let's go!

551
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,344
- Calm down.
- Don't let her move.

552
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,262
Carlos!

553
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,972
Come on, boss! Let's go.

554
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,557
- Pablo!
- Carlos!

555
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,520
No!

556
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,648
Come on! Come on!

557
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,901
Boss, come on!

558
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,028
Let's go, boss!

559
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,699
Come on!

560
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:28,368
- Let's go!
- Carlos!

561
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,001
No!

562
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,182
Los Pepes...

563
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,771
the Cali cartel, Judy Moncada,

564
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:41,692
the Castaños, the government, the gringos.

565
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,570
Let the bastards come.

566
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,991
We'll be ready for a war,
a fucking bloodbath.

567
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:53,745
We will fight like we have never
fought before in our lives.

568
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,290
Yes, boss.

569
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,793
Go for food and you go for firewood.

570
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:08,343
Whoever did this
will never get near us ever again.

571
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,725
I promise you.

572
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:26,445
Daddy, how will Santa
know how to find us?

573
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,832
Santa...

574
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:47,716
Santa will always find
your good and kind heart.

575
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,512
Wherever you are in this world.

576
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:57,934
Boss? The wood is all wet.
There's no way to light it up.

577
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,198
Go to Envigado for wood and food.

578
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,701
- Right away, boss.
- Be careful not to be seen.

579
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,911
Got it.

580
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,793
This is all I could find, boss.

581
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,420
How do you open that shit?

582
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,214
I'll go look, boss.

583
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,982
This just came in.

584
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,115
Shit's getting real, Peña.

585
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,839
Mommy, I'm cold.

586
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,218
She's freezing.

587
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,226
Put this on.

588
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:43,058
You and the children...
need to leave Colombia.

589
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:51,733
When you're safe,
I'll be free to do what's best for us.

590
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,953
It won't be long.

591
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,251
Soon we'll be together again.

592
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,257
Forever.
