00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:40,040
[Judy in Spanish] I'm sure you recognize
some of these people, right? Agent Peña?

2
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,128
It looks like you raided
the family album...

3
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,006
Mrs. Moncada.

4
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,383
Please, call me Judy.

5
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,470
Let me tell you...

6
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,348
before this son of a bitch
killed my husband and my brother,

7
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,351
all these people were my friends.
What do you think of that?

8
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,898
Well, it looks to me
like you made some new friends. No?

9
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,736
We might say that we share a common goal.

10
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,532
- The same as yours, Agent Peña.
- Is that right?

11
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,451
- Yes.
- [chuckles]

12
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,123
[in English]
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

13
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,501
[in Spanish]
Wait, Javier.

14
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,630
I'd like you to listen
to what we have to say.

15
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:33,009
You want to catch Escobar,
just like we do.

16
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,970
But let's not lie to ourselves.

17
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,432
You haven't been able to get close to him.

18
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:44,813
The only play you had to get to him
was using Carrillo.

19
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,649
And we know how that ended, right?

20
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:52,695
So, you're taking a break
from burning down villages?

21
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,742
What we do is fill in
for an absent government.

22
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:02,705
We're going to kill everyone
close to Escobar one by one.

23
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,459
Until he's alone. With nothing.

24
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,213
[Fidel]
What we want, Mr. Peña,

25
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:14,050
is to make Escobar understand
he is not untouchable.

26
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,969
We want him to be afraid.

27
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,429
There's just one small problem.

28
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,807
Just one?

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:28,022
To catch him, we need the satellite
technology and surveillance

30
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,108
that your government has, Agent Peña.

31
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,696
And I'm just going to...
hand that over to you?

32
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,199
We have been partners for a while now,
Agent Peña.

33
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,786
All the information that he gave to you,
I gave to him.

34
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:48,209
We are simply making...
a small adjustment.

35
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,974
Thanks for the drink.

36
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,747
Too much stupidity for my liking.

37
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,376
The Castaños can be useful.

38
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,129
I was talking about you.

39
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,300
Yes, Javier.

40
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,011
I'm a narco.

41
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,640
And I believe in honor and loyalty,
like you.

[Judy sighs]

46
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,160
Are you going to give me a cigarette
or what?

47
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,633
Mmm.

48
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,345
Well...

49
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,351
we really want you to realize, Agent Peña,

50
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:32,105
the potential of what we're offering you.
Mmm?

51
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,945
Because, well...
with all the information in the world,

52
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,197
you still have to be a policeman, right?

53
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,122
I know what it feels like
when Pablo kills someone close to you.

54
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,917
What's that?

55
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,796
Information that would be
very valuable to you.

56
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,049
That was very easy for us to find.
Take it.

57
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:09,684
She's staying with a friend.
That little girl, Maritza.

58
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,021
The woman that betrayed you
and got Carrillo killed.

59
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,522
You'll find her there.

60
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,821
I told you we have an enemy in common.

[Steve]
Life goes on, right?

66
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,743
And for Escobar,
that was a pretty good thing.

67
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,539
He remained at large,
protected by an army of sicarios...

68
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,084
in a city that refused to give him up.

69
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,796
Pablo kept his lawyers working overtime...

70
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:49,427
continuing to negotiate his surrender
with Colombian Attorney General De Greiff.

71
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,221
But it was bullshit.

72
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,057
Why surrender when
you're holding all the cards?

73
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,145
He was free. And business was booming.

with catching Escobar,

what's it worth?

as the head of the Search Bloc

156
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,063
would take a lot more than bravery.

Gaviria couldn't count on someone
raising their hand.

158

- Colonel, how are you doing?
- Very well.

176
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,493
I enjoyed your speech very much,
Mr. President.

177
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,870
I'm glad. It was also for you.

178
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:02,252
Look, Colonel, in the last 24 hours,
I've been discussing with my advisors

179
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,047
who should be at the head
of the Search Bloc.

180
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,008
They mentioned many names.

181
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,553
But I would like it to be you,
Colonel Martinez.

182
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,684
That's an honor, Mr. President,
but at this point in my career,

183
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:21,939
- I'm sure you can find a better candidate.
- Colombia wants to end this nightmare.

184
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,651
And I know you're the man to do it.

185
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,321
The nation deserves someone
better than me.

186
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:36,370
Your son was one of the best
in the academy. He's an excellent cadet.

187
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,747
He worked very hard.
I'm very proud of him.

188
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,712
We asked the best in the class
to join the Search Bloc.

189
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,840
And your son happily accepted.

190
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,053
I ask that you at least
consider my request.

191
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,724

I can't believe you brought me from Miami
to see my sister like this.

No. I'm just so happy to see you.

If that son of a bitch was still alive,
many more policemen would have died.

Do you think the police agree with you?

Well, business can always
get better, right?

225
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,019
[Steve]
Business was pretty good.

226
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,898
And a large part of that
was due to a guy they called the Lion.

227
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,317
You might remember him
as a Medellín hustler

228
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:17,364
who used to stuff bricks of cocaine into
his jacket and smuggle them into Miami.

229
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:22,452
Well, he stayed in Miami
and he made it his town.

230
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,997
[woman moans]

231
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,499
[Steve]
He was responsible for a smuggling network

232
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,378
that brought in Pablo's cocaine
by the ton. He was great at it.

233
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,924
But getting cocaine into the States
wasn't really the problem.

234
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,928
The problem was,
what do you do with all that money?

235
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:44,766
Sure, some of it could stay in the States.
And the narcos did that.

236
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,396
They bought crooked banks,
real estate, car dealerships,

237
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,982
race horses, art, you name it.

238
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:57,529
But if you're gonna run a cocaine empire,
you need to have a lot of cash on hand.

239
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,866
And getting cash back into Colombia
wasn't easy.

240
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,577
Let me put it this way:

241
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,205
This is what a ton of cocaine looks like.

242
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:12,336
And here's what the same ton of cocaine
looks like when it's converted into cash.

243
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,462
See the problem?

244
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,966
Lion had to be creative
with how he got that money to Pablo.

245
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,346
And he was.
His shipments showed up like clockwork.

246
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,227
But the deeper Pablo went into his war
with the government...

247
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,272
the more important these shipments were.

248
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,525
Pablo needed more money than ever.

249
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,153
Without it, he was fucked.

about business.

to making money, brother.

- Exactly.

something good would come from all this.

want Juan Pablo and Manuela to worry?

339
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,894
You're right.

340
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,108
When Pablo was a little boy...

341
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,156
he came home from school one day,
very angry.

342
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,537
A little girl made fun of his shoes.

343
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,123
They were ragged.

344
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,002
And we didn't have any money
to buy him new ones.

345
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:43,466
But that night, I went into town
and I stole a pair from a store.

346
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,969
The next day, Pablo went back to school.

347
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:55,144
Being poor is not an excuse
to look like you are.

348
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,692
You've always just taken
what you wanted, right?

349
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,527
And Pablo as well.

350
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,198
[in English]
Mr. Ambassador,

351
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:11,035
I believe people fall
into two categories, basically:

352
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,537
those who rely on hope...

353
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,249
and those who rely on faith,

354
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:20,503
who see a system at work in the world
and are devoted to it.

355
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:26,467
It may be religion,
but in the case of police work, a method.

356
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,346
I'm guessing that you fall
on the faith side.

357
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,639
Correct.

358
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,226
We can catch Escobar
in any number of ways.

359
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,856
But if the one we choose
furthers an already strained relationship

360
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,775
between the Colombian people
and its police,

361
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:47,071
a strain caused by
years of corruption and abuse,

362
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,781
then we'll have lost.

363
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,325
Even if we catch him.

364
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,703
Your philosophy is our philosophy,
Colonel.

365
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,623
Yeah, we'll see about that.

366
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,916
Thank you very much.

367
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,295
- [Crosby] Good to sit down with you.
- Mr. Ambassador,

368
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,089
the whole world is watching
how we handle this.

369
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:10,678
I won't allow it to be corrupted
by outside interests or darker instincts.

370
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,277
[in Spanish]
It worked.

371
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,988
We're even.

372
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:34,327
I need you to help me get a visa
and get my family out of Medellín.

373
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,579
Somewhere Pablo can't find us.

374
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,999
It doesn't work like that.

375
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,960
I'm sorry.

376
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,170
So, then...?

377
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,173
How am I supposed to be okay?

378
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,996
Is this how things are going to work
from now on, Peña?

379
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:23,334
Don't worry about it, okay?
It won't happen again.

380
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:28,006
- No. I'm not worried.
- [starts engine]

381
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,018
[Don Berna]
Leave us.

382
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,402
Life's funny, Velasco.

383
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,489
This could easily
have ended up in reverse.

384
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:59,412
Me lying there,
you and your men ready to torture me.

385
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,166
Look how everything's changed.

386
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,181
We are both loyal soldiers.

387
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,313
Serving our generals.

388
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,566
But you know what?

389
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,862
When it's time to give up your boss...

390
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,824
[grunts, breathing heavily]

391
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,118
...we give up our boss.

392
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,871
[screaming]

393
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:51,464
Ma'am, nothing about Pablo, but...
he gave up this.

394
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:05,061
- Three of his accountants.
- And their addresses.

395
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:09,107
He also told me Pablo
still has a large army and a lot of money.

396
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,819
Yes, but that could be complete bullshit,
no? To scare us off.

397
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,199
Or it could be true. To scare us off.

398
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,539
[sighs]

399
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,625
There lies the key.

400
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,088
If we leave him without money,
we leave him without an army.

401
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,298
Something else.

402
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,509
Velasco was going to the airport tomorrow

403
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,554
because the Lion will be arriving
in the afternoon from Miami.

404
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,018
[people chuckling, chattering nearby]

405
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,606
Excuse me, sir. It's Judy Moncada.

406
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,825
Mrs. Moncada.

407
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,453
How can I help you?

408
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,516
How was your trip? You must be beat.

409
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,143
[in English]
Let's go. Get in.

410
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,811
[in Spanish]
Where's Velasco?

411
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,362
[whistles softly]

412
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,542
There he is.

413
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,378
Welcome.

414
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,633
- Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela.
- Lion.

415
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,594
This is my brother, Miguel.

416
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,347
And this gentleman is our associate,
Pacho Herrera.

417
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,100
I'm very pleased to meet you, gentlemen.
It's a pleasure.

418
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,395
Lion... May I call you that?

419
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,358
- Yes, sir.
- Have a drink. Relax.

420
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,820
They say, over there,
that you like whiskey.

421
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,284
Listen, gentlemen,
if I did something to offend you, or...

422
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:30,915
What? Would we offer you a drink
if we were offended?

423
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,459
Have a seat.

424
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,306
Tell me something, Lion.

425
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,977
Do you like working for a thug?

426
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,402
[Pablo] One...

427
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:03,239
- two, three! [chuckles]
- [laughing]

428
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,616
- Very good.
- [men murmuring]

429
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,326
Good job.

430
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,953
Look after your sister.

431
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,793
What happened?

432
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,503
[Blackie]
Hey, boss...

433
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,007
Lion just called, sir.

434
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,635
He said Velasco never showed up
at the airport, sir.

435
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,723
Lion got scared shitless and left.
He took a plane back to Miami.

436
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:33,311
Fucking Lion.
Is he a little bitch or what, brother?

437
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:37,606
- And where is Velasco?
- Boss, I have no idea.

438
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,652
Find him for me.

439
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,654
Right away, boss.

440
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,619
[upbeat Latin music plays on radio]

441
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:59,086
- [Carlos] I can't believe you're cooking.
- But you know I always helped my mother.

442
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,630
Uh-uh. I helped while you ate.

443
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,091
[Carlos chuckles]

444
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:09,764
You know, I'm very happy
that Pablo brought me here.

445
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,807
But I'm worried about you.

446
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,810
No. There's no reason to worry.

447
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,687
For God's sake, Tata.

448
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,857
Every cop in the country
is looking for Pablo.

449
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,736
Every drug trafficker
who's not from Medellín wants him dead.

450
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,323
And you're telling me there's no reason
to worry? Don't kid yourself.

451
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,660
Today is a good day, Carlos.

452
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,705
My family is all together. You're here.

453
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,338
Pablo is a strong man.
He's always had to be.

454
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,383
There's no reason to change anything now.

455
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,854
I hope you're hungry.

456
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,069
[knocking]

457
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,870
Come inside, I'm packing.

458
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,498
Are you going to let me go to Medellín
or what?

459
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,334
Is that why you accepted the job?

460
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,670
You never should have volunteered.

461
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:27,049
But you can't be reassigned now,
because it would end your career, right?

462
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,844
Sure, only now I'm gonna be
"the boss's son."

463
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,512
[sighs]

464
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,516
It appears to me you don't understand
what's happening.

465
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,311
I accepted because I wanted
to help my country.

466
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,315
Come here, I want to show you something.

467
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,614
I received this urn with my name.

468
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,745
Look. On behalf of Pablo Escobar.

469
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,542
It's an obituary.

470
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:08,382
Look, son, you're going to do
exactly as I tell you.

471
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,051
I'm going to make sure you survive this.
Understand?

472
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,269
[in English] We're polishing
this bottle off pretty fast.

473
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,772
Listen, I am not missing my flight
for anything tomorrow.

474
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,399
Mmm?

475
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,526
No.

476
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,405
You sure you can't stay?

477
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:37,161
I can't leave Olivia
with my sister forever, Steve.

478
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,998
- Anyway, you'll be in Medellín.
- Ah.

479
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:45,419
You know,
I met the new head of Search Bloc.

480
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,338
- Yeah?
- He's an interesting guy.

481
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,674
I have a good feeling about him.

482
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,805
Before I forget, I want you...

483
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,642
I want you to give this to Olivia.

484
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,563
Meant to be good luck.

485
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,277
You keep it then.

486
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,078
I am gonna miss you.

487
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,291
[in Spanish]
From now on,

488
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,795
the Search Bloc is going to operate
in a more systematic fashion.

489
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,467
Since we unfortunately cannot
rely on the information given to us

490
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,219
by the people of Medellín...

491
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:40,474
we are going to implement
a quadrant search.

492
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,061
We will position ourselves
in the neighborhoods

493
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,356
where we believe Escobar
and his allies might be,

494
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,192
proceed to search them...

495
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,071
and if we don't find
what we're looking for,

496
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,783
we'll process anything of value
and continue on to the next one.

497
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,453
- Understood?
- [all] Yes, Colonel!

498
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,583
[in English]
A fucking grid search?

499
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,961
Isn't that how they caught the guy
who shot Abraham Lincoln?

500
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:12,631
- It's a change.
- Yeah, it's dated and conventional.

501
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,220
Well, we tried going
bullet for bullet with him,

502
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,139
and you saw how that ended up.

503
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,309
Oh, so that's it?

504
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,562
A week ago you volunteered
to jump into a chopper with Carrillo

505
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,063
and now it's a change?

506
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:34,737
Don't worry about it, man. We'll all
feel better once Escobar's in the ground

507
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,157
- one way or another, right?
- There is no other way, Javi.

508
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,951
Search Bloc is the only game in town.

509
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,623
You really think this asshole
can get it done?

510
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,958
I don't know. Maybe he'll surprise us.

511
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,587
Okay.

512
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,590
Grid search it is.

513
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,769
[sighs]

514
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,567
[in Spanish]
What did you find out from Velasco?

515
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,113
Not a fucking thing.

516
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:22,534
That son of a bitch turned out to be
a lot tougher than I thought.

517
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,967
Is that what I think it is?

518
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,849
Rules of the game:

519
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,979
We only go after armed people. Sicarios.

520
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:58,028
There won't be any information
about businesses or labs or shipments.

521
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,739
This isn't about helping Judy.

522
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,908
This is about killing Pablo.

523
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,542
Well, then...

524
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,963
here's to killing Pablo.

525
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,507
[chatter in Spanish]

526
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:22,511
[Steve] Of course, Peña knew
the information he had given Berna

527
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,929
was already bearing fruit.

528
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,765
- [gunshots]
- [woman screams]

529
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,767
[in Spanish]
For Colombia!

530
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:50,873
[Steve] The Castaños and their men
were efficient, if not always subtle.

531
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,709
- It didn't matter.
- [indistinct Spanish]

532
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,961
What's newsworthy
about a few dead sicarios

533
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,713
in the murder capital of the world?

534
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,298
- [man grunts]
- [impact thud]

535
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,263
- [gunshots]
- Of course, I'm not sure Javi knew

536
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,224
just how fucked up things
were really gonna get.

537
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,813
[in Spanish]
Follow me and cover me!

538
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,444
[Steve] Hard to feel sorry for a bunch
of drug dealers getting whacked, right?

539
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:27,868
These guys had sown a lot of violence
over the years... killed a lot of people.

540
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,620
[man shouts in Spanish]

541
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,914
It was about time they got some payback.

542
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:37,044
But turning a bunch
of well-armed vigilantes loose

543
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,921
on the streets of Medellín...

544
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:45,010
was like pouring gasoline on a fire
that was already out of control.

545
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,278
[in Spanish]
Boss?

546
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:12,746
Sorry to bother you, but something bad
is happening in the city, boss.

547
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:16,166
Five of our men, dead.

548
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,919
Who was it?

549
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:23,840
I don't know, boss. If I knew,
I'd kill the son of a bitch that did it.

550
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:27,719
Boss, I'm so sorry,
but La Quica's on the phone.

551
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:44,319
- And Velasco?
- It looks like a battlefield, boss.

552
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:52,578
No one's seen Velasco
and no one knows where he is. Boss...

553
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,080
you know that if someone
grabbed Velasco...

554
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,040
Yes.

555
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,428
Start packing.

556
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,767
- [indistinct chatter]
- Your turn, let's do it again.

557
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,270
[together]
My little rock made of paper...

558
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:23,942
how much do you want to eat?

559
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,654
Show your grandmother
how you washed your hands.

560
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,948
[door opens]

561
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,792
Looks good.

562
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,670
Pardon me.

563
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,718
Should we start?

564
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,804
[Hermilda]
Dig in, dig in.

565
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,892
So good.

566
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,226
[whispers] A spoon?

567
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,104
There's no spoon, love. How about a fork?

568
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,000
[Steve]
Martinez was right.

569
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,419
We all need a method.

570
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:31,051
Something to cling to when the shit
around us gets so deep, we might go under.

571
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:37,057
Something to guide us home
when we feel we've lost our way.

572
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:42,729
If we're lucky, someone gives us
a method and we follow it.

573
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,233
If not, we find our own.

574
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:50,612
Pablo's enemies
had found their own method.

575
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,572
And it was an ugly one.

576
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:58,078
They had opened up a new war against him,
striking from the shadows.

577
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:02,999
Showing him that, even in his hometown,
he wasn't safe.

578
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,963
[in Spanish]
The Castaños are very efficient.

579
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,173
[Gilberto]
But not very discreet.

580
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:17,097
No one can know
we had anything to do with this.

581
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,642
[Steve] And the moment
their method became apparent...

582
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,185
[in Spanish]
Excuse me.

583
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,104
...the message was clear.

584
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,107
There was a new player in town.

585
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,735
What does it say?

586
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,028
And they weren't fucking around.

587
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:36,032
"Your days are numbered, Pablo.
No one around you is safe."

588
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,452
- [flies buzzing]
- Signed "Los Pepes."

589
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,165
Who in the hell are Los Pepes?

590
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,385
[Latin guitar song plays]
