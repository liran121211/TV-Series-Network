Pablo Escobar said, "Sometimes I'm God.

If I say a man dies,
he dies the same day."

[screaming sobs]

00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,369
In his career, this asshole
killed thousands of police officers

6
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,164
at a rate of over 400 a year.

7
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,918
With numbers like that staring you
in the face, you have to ask...

8
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,921
what possesses a man to put on a uniform

9
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,717
that all but guarantees
his days are numbered?

[shouting in Spanish]

11
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,389
Most of them were just kids,

12
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,976
raised to reach a fork in the road
and choose the right path.

13
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,480
Fight for the good guys.

14
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,817
They were young, they were full of hope...

15
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,820
and they thought they were invincible.

16
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,865
WE LOVE YOU!

17
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:17,035
And those that were left behind
would feel their loss the most.

18
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,954
Everybody's got a breaking point,

19
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,208
when shit sickens them so much
that they just have to act.

20
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:29,714
For Pinzón,
that breaking point meant resignation.

21
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,759
[man in Spanish]
Present arms!

22
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:37,055
[Steve] But there were those who couldn't
resign, who couldn't just walk away.

23
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:40,642
- [man shouts orders in Spanish]
- Presidents have breaking points, too.

24
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:45,271
And Gaviria had finally found his.

25
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,359
[in Spanish] I am responsible
for the death of those men, Eduardo.

26
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:56,282
And if Escobar is using their deaths
to send me a message, then I will respond.

27
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,035
I agree completely.

28
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,496
We have to go in full force.

29
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,584
Keep in mind... bringing him back
won't be a popular decision.

30
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,339
But since when do we care
about being popular, huh?

Yes, Mr. President.

00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,983
[in Spanish] Boss, they're all saying
they don't know anything.

37
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,985
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

38
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,573
You gentlemen are under the impression
that you work for the Moncadas.

39
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:28,369
Allow me to clarify.
You have never worked for the Moncadas.

40
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,622
You work for me,
and you have always worked for me.

41
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,832
- Blackie.
- Yes, boss.

42
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,210
Who gave Judy Moncada
the cash to buy this house?

43
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,294
You, Don Pablo.

44
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,546
- Jairo.
- Yes, Don Pablo.

45
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,841
The money that puts food on the table
for these men, where does it come from?

46
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,719
- From your pocket.
- Everything you see here is mine.

47
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:51,726
Everything you have
is because I allow you to have it.

48
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:59,108
Everything you think you are protecting,
you are protecting for me.

49
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,653
Are we clear on this?

50
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,160
You're going to tell me the location
of every safe house, every lab,

51
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,746
every office,
every account of the Moncadas.

52
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,039
And look...

53
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,919
that doesn't make you gentlemen traitors.

54
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,255
Certainly not.

55
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:28,221
You simply didn't know
who you were really working for.

56
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,433
So let's begin...

57
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,353
with what's most important.

58
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,693
You're... going to tell me right now...

59
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:51,369
where that bitch Judy Moncada is hiding.

[horse whinnies nearby]

61

- Thank you.

Pardon me.

67
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:35,955
Listen, Pacho,
are you sure you have enough men?

68
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,666
One might get the impression
you're scared of someone.

69
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:46,132
Perhaps if you took security
more seriously...

70
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,803
just maybe your husband
would still be alive...

71
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,432
and you wouldn't be coming to us for help.

72
00:07:55,641 --> 00:08:00,313
Listen to this guy.

73
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,399
Where's your boss?

74
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,362
You mean my partner.

- Handling the business.
- Is that right?

he isn't a drug trafficker?

What a lovely surprise.

95
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,467
- To what do we owe the pleasure?
- Business.

96
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:02,518
"And one by one, the nights
between our separated cities,

97
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,605
they are added to the night
that unites us."

Not a fan of Neruda?

100
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:16,907
The only thing that unites us in this life
is a desire to see Pablo dead.

101
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,245
[Steve]
This is Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela.

102
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,872
And if you've never heard of him,

103
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,249
it's because that's exactly
the way he wants it.

104
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,794
Ask him what he does for a living
and he'll tell you that he's a banker,

105
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,421
and that would be true.

106
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,633
In fact, he and his brother Miguel
controlled their own bank.

107
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,636
Or he might tell you that
he and his brother owned and operated

108
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,430
one of Colombia's largest chains
of drug stores.

109
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:44,060
The brothers could also tell you they ran
their own soccer team. Which they did.

110
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,730
América de Cali,
one of the best teams on the continent

111
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,025
and a fierce rival
of Pablo's Atlético Nacional.

112
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:56,113
But what they'd never tell you
is that these businesses were a front

113
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,074
and that the Rodríguez brothers

114
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,951
were the second biggest
cocaine traffickers in the world:

115
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,205
the leaders of the Cali cartel.

116
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,375
Like Pablo and the Medellín cartel,

117
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:11,045
they started out as run-of-the-mill
criminals: bank robbers.

118
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,672
And with all that money they scored
from their heists,

119
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,300
they quickly graduated to smuggling weed.

120
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,178
And when they realized
that ten pounds of blow

121
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,305
was worth as much as a ton of marijuana,

122
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,308
they jumped headfirst
into the cocaine business.

123
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,269
These guys were no piece of shit
street dealers.

124
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,649
They planned meticulously,
maximizing profit, minimizing risk.

125
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:35,111
As the business grew,
a young ambitious Colombian kid,

126
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:39,615
a guy you might know named Pacho Herrera,
was such a good earner

127
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,493
that the brothers eventually
promoted him to partner.

128
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:47,164
But they had a competitor,
and not just any competitor.

129
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,918
One that wasn't interested in abdicating
the throne as the king of coke.

130
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,963
- Don Pablo.
- But Gilberto was smart.

131
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,048
He didn't care that Escobar
wore the crown.

132
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,132
[in Spanish]
Gentlemen.

133
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,761
So they went to him with a proposal:
Miami, the cocaine capital of the world,

134
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,932
would remain Pablo's territory,
and in return, the Rodríguez brothers

135
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,519
would make do with a little territory
in the northeast called New York City.

136
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,772
- [up-tempo dance music plays]
- The extra 1,089 miles may have made it

137
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,484
a little harder to get to,
but it turns out the folks in New York

138
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,572
were just as head over heels for cocaine
as the folks down south.

139
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,575
And while there were
1.8 million people in Miami,

140
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,910
there were seven million in New York City.

141
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,540
As much as the Cali guys loved money
and the finer things in life,

142
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,709
they hated the wrong kind of attention.

143
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:36,297
For the "Gentlemen of Cali," it was about
appearing like legitimate businessmen.

144
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,676
And business was good. But that didn't
mean that it couldn't get better.

145
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,847
[in Spanish] So tell me, Mrs. Moncada,
why did you come all this way?

146
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,268
To help you kill the man
who murdered my husband and brother

147
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,980
by offering very important information
that only I possess.

148
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,275
- And what is this information?
- Targets.

149
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,611
The location of every one of his labs.

150
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:04,783
Going after Pablo's infrastructure
will cripple him, force him to surface.

151
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:09,830
When he does, we put a bullet in his head
and we take turns shitting on him.

152
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,667
What's valuable isn't knowing
what Pablo has,

153
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,836
but what he wants to acquire.

154
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,963
Because that's where he'll be next.

155
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,592
Pablo is picking apart your operation
piece by piece.

156
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,803
Knowing what remains
tells us where he's going.

157
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,684
You want me to tell you where my labs are?

158
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,898
Well... let's say...

159
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:43,072
that I share that information. Hmm?
What happens to my labs?

160
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,533
Oh, Judy.

161
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,369
Your sense of vengeance is heartwarming.

162
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,372
Kiko would be so proud of your priorities.

163
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,750
Mmm. You're right.

164
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,795
He would be very proud of me.

165
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,840
I built the business by his side, Pacho.

166
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,261
I'm from the Medellín cartel.
I know what I am.

167
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:10,349
I don't need bullshit art
hanging on my wall to prove any different.

168
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,393
Wait, wait, wait.

169
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,062
Hold on.

170
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,694
Confronting Pablo directly
won't help us maintain a low profile.

171
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,696
But...

172
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:31,120
what if the Search Bloc were to learn
the location of your labs?

173
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,124
What good is it if he's arrested?

174
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,628
He's already shown
he can fuck us from prison.

175
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,089
This won't end with Pablo in a cell.

176
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,592
You think the police will kill him?

177
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,263
There is one officer
that seems particularly determined.

178
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,308
And President Gaviria
has arranged for his return.

179
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,395
[Steve] This was one thing that
the Cali guys and the DEA could agree on.

180
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,732
As controversial
as Colonel Carrillo's methods were,

181
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,776
he was the only guy
that Escobar was afraid of.

182
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,904
And returning command
of Search Bloc to him

183
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,197
was exactly what we needed.

184
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:11,285
The president has offered us every
available resource to defeat Escobar.

185
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,370
All we have to do now
is manage it properly.

186
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,873
So I'm still gonna rely on
intelligence from you.

187
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,543
But we're gonna do things
a little bit differently.

188
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,464
No more large-scale operations. Search
Bloc goes back to small-scale tactics.

189
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,758
- Amen.
- Stealth operations, surprise raids,

190
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,968
that sort of thing. We change the game.

191
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,056
But there's one thing
that we need to do first. Trujillo.

192
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:36,894
[in Spanish] Assemble the Search Bloc
outside. I want 100 men and six trucks.

193
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,772
- Tell them we're moving out. Got it?
- On it, Colonel.

194
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:46,028
[in English] A hundred men?
That's not exactly small-scale tactics.

195
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,823
First thing is,
we let Pablo know that we're back.

196
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,452
[sirens chirping]

197
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,666
[Steve] Now you can bet that
the second a convoy of a hundred men

198
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,168
and six marked police trucks
leave that base,

199
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,380
that Escobar's army of spotters
would be burning up the phone lines

200
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,049
- just to tell Escobar all about it.
- [phone rings]

201
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,344
- [in Spanish] What's up?
- They just left. Four motorcycles,

202
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:14,390
five pickups, and a truck.
It's a large convoy.

203
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,394
[Steve] And you'd be right.
But that was the point.

204
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,106
You see, these spotters
made it impossible for us to operate

205
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,316
in the secrecy we required.

206
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,402
So we needed to blind them.

207
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,906
And the first step to blinding someone
is getting them to open their eyes.

208
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,452
[in Spanish] They're heading to Barrio
Escobar. It's going to get crowded.

209
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,621
[in English]
Probably this rooftop here.

210
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,666
[Steve] Once those signals went up,
we could pick them up,

211
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,127
get a fix and get a location of each one.

212
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,464
[in Spanish]
The convoy has arrived.

213
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,474
[men chattering in Spanish]

214
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,147
[man]
We're in position.

215
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,359
A MAN, A NEIGHBORHOOD, A COUNTRY!

216
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,738
[Steve] And I guess you could say
that the second part of Carrillo's plan

217
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,824
was to show Pablo
that the sheriff was back in town.

218
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,869
And he did that the best way he could.

219
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,671
[in Spanish]
Look. Look up there.

220
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,133
There's something weird happening.
What do you see?

221
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,802
[Juan Pablo] They're clouds.
[Pablo] No, not clouds.

222
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,680
Because clouds form shapes.

223
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:42,186
- What I see is a turtle.
- [Velasco] Boss!

224
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,731
- Excuse me. I need to talk to you.
- [Pablo] Keep looking.

225
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,861
Keep looking at the clouds.

226
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,950
Sir, sorry to interrupt,
but it's very important.

227
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,912
- [sighs] What's going on?
- Carrillo is back.

228
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,706
And he's here in Medellín.

229
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,380
Hmm.

230
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,926
What else?

231
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:21,141
That son of a bitch
filled Barrio Escobar with police and...

232
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,145
he pissed on your mural, sir.

233
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,736
Hmm.

234
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:58,011
[man 1] Those fucking cops
are going up 26th Street.

235
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,847
[man 2]
Copy that, brother. All good.

236
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,890
- [in English] We got 'em.
- Keeps going like that

237
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,602
until you reached Barrio Pablo Escobar.
We captured six radio transmissions.

238
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,480
But we haven't pinpointed
the exact location.

239
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,691
- No, sir.
- So our best bet

240
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,319
is to corner each of these buildings.
This time, we hit the ground.

241
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,742
[in Spanish] Trujillo, load up
six unmarked cars, four men per car.

242
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,454
Instruct them to leave in 20-minute
intervals to avoid attention. Clear?

243
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,747
- Yes, Colonel.
- Okay.

244
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,583
[in English]
Peña, you're with me.

245
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,752
Murphy, Jacoby, you stay here to guide us.

246
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,381
- Careful out there.
- [Javier sighs]

247
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,594
[up-tempo Latin song plays]

248
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,763
[laughing]

249
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,892
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]
- [engines start]

250
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,773
- [in Spanish] Freeze! Don't move!
- [weapons cocking]

251
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,362
Relax. Everything's good.

252
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,989
[man]
What is this?

253
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,574
[man on radio]
Piraña down.

254
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,951
[in English]
Oh, we got one. Spotter One is down.

255
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,540
[in Spanish]
Son of a bitch.

256
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,005
Where are you going? Where are you going?!
[mutters in Spanish]

257
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:19,927
[man shouts]
Get him! Get him! Get him!

258
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,553
- Don't move!
- [man whistles]

259
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,764
Don't move!

260
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,182
- Good evening.
- Yes?

261
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,727
Would you allow me to search your house?
We're looking for...

262
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,230
Stop! Stop, boy! Stop!

263
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,607
- [woman chatters in Spanish]
- Get on the floor!

264
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,619
Show me your hands.

265
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,083
You think you're slick?
Why were you running?

266
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:55,712
- No! What did I do wrong?
- You tell me what you did.

267
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,700
Do you know who I am?

268
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,288
My name is Colonel Horacio Carrillo.

269
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:35,794
Last week,
30 police officers were murdered.

270
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:39,423
- Those pigs probably deserved it.
- [murmurs in English] Shut up, kid.

271
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,178
[in Spanish] Many of them were my friends.

272
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:50,809
A person perched on rooftops,
guiding murderers with radios...

273
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,645
are assassins themselves.

274
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:58,191
I hope after this encounter,
you'll reconsider

275
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:04,614
working with someone
who thinks he's above the law.

276
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,326
[Carrillo cocks pistol]

277
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,997
What? Am I supposed to
shit my pants in fear?

278
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,042
No.

279
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,883
[Carrillo]
Do I make myself clear?

280
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,634
I want you to tell your friends

281
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:28,096
that this is what happens
when you work for Pablo Escobar!

282
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,245
Take it.

283
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,706
Take it.

284
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,216
Tell them this is for Pablo.

285
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,139
Remember what you saw.

286
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:17,562
And know what will happen to you
if I see you on a rooftop.

287
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,397
You can leave.

288
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,317
Leave!

289
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,216
So, what book shall we read
before bed tonight?

290
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,884
The Witch.

291
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,678
No, my love. No scary stories.

292
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,347
The Witch? What's that? I don't know it.

293
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,016
Dad reads it to us. Right, Dad?

294
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,353
- The bad witch and the good witch, right?
- [Juan Pablo] Yes.

295
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,397
Not The Witch, Pablo.

296
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,358
I don't want any more scary stories
in this house.

297
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,491
Love, take your sister
and brush your teeth.

298
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,285
And go straight to bed.

299
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,123
[Pablo]
Listen, where's my kiss?

300
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,292
Good night.

301
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,379
- Good night, my love.
- Straight to bed, Manuela, please.

302
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,261
[dishes clattering]

303
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:45,108
- I heard a scary story, Pablo.
- [Hermilda] Tata.

304
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,612
The man who killed Gustavo
is back in Medellín.

305
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,156
Is that story true?

306
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,492
Yes.

307
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:02,000
Does that sound like the government
is trying to negotiate? Huh?

308
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,547
Good night.

309
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,606
Someone has to tell you
how things are, Pablo.

310
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,861
That man is here to kill you.

311
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,396
I'm scared, Pablo.

312
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,777
I promise you one thing:

313
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:15,615
if things get out of hand
and I can't control it...

314
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,243
we'll leave the country.

315
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,123
Okay?

316
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:40,390
[in English]
Javi, where are the fucking spotters?

317
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,310
Carrillo went a different way.
He, uh... he cut them loose.

318
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,186
Oh, we're letting people go now?

319
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,064
Yeah, Murphy, we're letting people go.

320
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,734
And what does that mean?

321
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,987
- Don't worry about it, man.
- Hey, fucking talk to me.

322
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,823
- Let go of my fucking arm.
- What the fuck happened?

323
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,996
Carrillo put a gun to the kid's head
and he pulled the trigger.

324
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,583
To make a fucking point.

325
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,129
We good now?

326
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,675
[engine starts]

327
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,302
Yeah, we're good.

328
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,684
[up-tempo Latin music playing]

329
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,854
- [in Spanish] Have you seen this woman?
- No.

330
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,274
She works at the market.

331
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,194
Sweetheart?

332
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,447
[grunts]

333
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,908
- Are you sure?
- No.

334
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,542
[La Quica sighs]

335
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,629
Nobody's seen the bitch.

336
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,839
I'm pissed off, brother.

337
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,553
[sighs]

338
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,892
Let's go for some ice cream.

339
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,185
Something cold.

340
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,895
[starts engine]

341
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,948
[knocks on door]

342
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,871
[in English] I'd like to talk to you
about what happened tonight.

343
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,334
- What do you think happened?
- I know I got left behind on purpose.

344
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,836
For your own best interest.

345
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,797
You don't know a goddamn thing
about my best interest.

346
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,217
You know, Murphy, what happens out there
isn't really for everyone.

347
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,094
- But it is for Peña?
- You're not Peña.

348
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,263
- 'Cause I'm a damn gringo.
- Because I trust him.

349
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,973
Why don't you try me?

350
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,601
This fight against Escobar,
you want to win it.

351
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,063
These guys aren't fighting
by the same rules, so why should we?

352
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,776
- You know what that means?
- Oh, I do.

353
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:02,657
So whether this is about protecting me
or protecting you, stop icing me out.

354
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,954
[door opens]

355
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,837
[woman in Spanish]
You were different this time.

356
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,388
I always know when my clients
are trying to forget something.

357
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,352
You know what I do to relax?

358
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,024
- I write.
- You write?

359
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,696
- What do you write?
- Letters.

360
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,907
For my family, but I never send them.

361
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,951
It's good to forget.

362
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,884
What do you want to forget?

363
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,850
Why don't you stop?

364
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,147
Why don't you?

365
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,790
[men murmur in Spanish]

366
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,923
[Velasco]
Welcome, brother.

367
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,759
This way.

368
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,648
- What is your name?
- David.

369
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:03,194
- I'm Pablo. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you, too.

370
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,529
Follow me.

371
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,034
They told me you like soccer.

372
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,372
- I play defense.
- Of course.

373
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,292
Those are the real men.

374
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,172
You're very brave, David.

375
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,176
I'm sorry for what you witnessed.

376
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:31,055
The people we're fighting
are very bad people.

377
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,808
Tell me about the man who did that.

378
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,564
He said this bullet is for you.

379
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,663
I need you to do one last favor for me.

380
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,709
It's very important.

381
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,295
You think you can do it?

382
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,803
Thank you, David.

383
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,265
[phone ringing]

384
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,060
Peña.

385
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,855
[in Spanish]
Agent Peña. This is Don Berna.

386
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,067
I have a proposition
you might be interested in.

387
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,695
What a surprise.

388
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,120
What's up, Peña?
Are you expecting anyone else?

389
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,873
No. Are you?

390
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,376
No, it's not necessary.

391
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,671
Everywhere I go in this town,
I'm surrounded by friends.

392
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:48,758
Sit down. Sit so you can taste
the best coffee in Medellín.

393
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:52,470
Doña Luz! Bring my friend a coffee.

394
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,015
You have something
other than coffee for me?

395
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,896
Look, Agent, I'm not one of those
street-corner informants

396
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,066
that you slip a few gringo dollars
for a tip. No, sir.

397
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,567
Then why are we here?

398
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,744
Agent, you and I
are like the snake and the cat.

399
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,999
If the snake has the chance,
it will kill the cat.

400
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,335
And if the cat has the chance,
it will kill the snake.

401
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:30,466
But there are times
when they see a big rat,

402
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,885
and they both want to eat it.

403
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,181
[in English]
This is Moncada's biggest lab.

404
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,184
It'll have to be inventoried
before it's dismantled and moved.

405
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,811
How you know that?

406
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,815
- One of my CI's.
- Hell of a tip.

407
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,150
It's a hell of a CI.

408
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,527
Look, you want Escobar's men,
there they are.

409
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,821
- Let's do it.
- All right.

410
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,085
[rap music playing inside]

411
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,707
[men shouting in Spanish]

412
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:58,513
- [automatic gunfire]
- [shouting continues]

413
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,412
[in English] Get up! Move! Move!
[murmurs indistinctly]

414
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,956
Get up!

415
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,332
Gato!

416
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:33,256
[in Spanish] No, no, no! Calm down.
Okay, relax. Don't kill me... [grunts]

417
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,675
Relax, relax, relax!

418
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,052
[men chattering in Spanish]

419
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,222
[man]
Detaining the prisoners.

420
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,767
[in English]
Your CI hooked us a pretty big fish.

421
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,144
Yeah, he's a winner.

422
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,271
[in Spanish]
We captured about 45 of them.

423
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,691
[in English]
Wonder if he'll give us Escobar.

424
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:55,486
- Don't know, we'll see what Carrillo gets.
- Yeah. We'll see.

425
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:03,411
Carrillo told me that he talked to you.
He thinks he can trust you.

426
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,163
Yeah, he can.

427
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,084
- That's not what I mean.
- Ahh.

428
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,587
Let's go.

429
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,423
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.

430
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,637
Yeah.

431
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,704
[in Spanish]
Approaching.

432
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,216
We're locking you up.

433
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,508
Move it!

434
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,261
- [in English] You get anything out of him?
- Something.

435
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,056
Not everything. Are you coming?

436
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,186
I'm in, yeah. Let's go.

437
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,143
- [in Spanish] Hello, Valeria.
- Pablo.

438
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,441
- I didn't realize you'd be here.
- I wanted to be sure it went well.

439
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:02,321
- People need to hear the truth, right?
- Yes, it's important.

440
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,826
They forced this boy
to watch his friend get shot.

441
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:10,621
When the country hears this story,
they'll turn on that son of a bitch

442
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,207
who's murdering children
for the Americans.

443
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,462
Well... that's what I hope.

444
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,883
I'm glad you came.

445
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,762
It's good to see you again.

446
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,524
Are all eyes still on you?

447
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,570
Except yours.

448
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,497
[Pablo sighs]

449
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,751
Let's begin.

450
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,004
Yes.

451
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,089
- [Valeria] How old are you?
- [David] Ten.

452
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,009
I understand you're quite a soccer player.

453
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,427
[chuckles]

454
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,388
Thank you for being brave enough
to tell us your story, David.

455
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:14,060
Tell me, who were the men
who brought you to the building that day?

456
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,020
They were Search Bloc policemen.

457
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,732
[Valeria]
Do you know why they brought you there?

458
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,777
[David] He said they were going
to send a message to other kids.

459
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,279
[Valeria]
Who is "he"? Do you remember his name?

460
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,323
[David]
Colonel Carrillo.

461
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,325
Relax, gentlemen, everything's fine.

462
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,787
- Where are you taking us?
- Bogotá.

463
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,500
You're going to jail
until this gets resolved.

464
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:41,921
But look...
if you help me, I can help you.

465
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:47,676
Give me Pablo, or Blackie or someone else,
then I'll help you.

466
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,429
I don't know where they are.
I don't know them.

467
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,391
- So you don't know anything?
- No, sir.

468
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,770
What about you, Gato?

469
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,359
All right.

470
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,779
If it's going to be like this...

471
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,571
[man screams]

472
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,580
[Valeria] Who else was there
besides Colonel Carrillo?

473
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,748
[David]
A bunch of men.

474
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:22,837
Some I heard speaking English.
Americans. Like in the movies.

475
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,256
[Valeria] Are you sure they were police?

476
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,716
Yes.

477
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,176
What now?

478
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:34,014
You think Pablo is going to reward you
for being brave?

479
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,560
Asshole, he doesn't even know you exist.
Do you know that?

480
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,729
It's your last chance, Gato.

481
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,399
Ask your mother, you son of bitch!

482
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,451
[faint screaming]

483
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,739
[sighs]

484
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,251
[line ringing]

485
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,336
[rings]

486
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,172
- Hello.
- Everything is good.

487
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,342
- It worked.
- Very well.

488
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,887
It worked.

489
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,477
- They took my lab.
- And a bunch of Escobar's men.

490
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,480
It's for a noble cause, Mrs. Moncada.

491
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,529
Boss, forgive me, but there's bad news.

492
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:16,367
Search Bloc took down the Moncadas'
biggest lab before we could take it apart.

493
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,996
Carrillo got Gato. We don't know where
they are or what they're doing to him.

494
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,704
[dialing]

495
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,248
[phone rings]

496
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,960
Hello?

497
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:09,961
Hello?

498
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,800
- Steve?
- Hey, baby.

499
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,552
What time is it?

500
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,554
Uh...

501
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,807
It's late.

502
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,143
Are you okay?

503
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:30,816
Yeah, I'm... good.
I just need to hear your voice.

504
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,405
I wanted to call, Steve. I...

505
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,951
It's okay. You don't have to explain.

506
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,746
What's happened?

507
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,707
Tell me.

508
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:52,838
I'm good, baby. I'm... Don't worry.
[clears throat]

509
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,759
[baby crying]

510
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,387
