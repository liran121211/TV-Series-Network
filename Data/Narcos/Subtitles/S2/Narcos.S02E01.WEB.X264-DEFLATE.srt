1
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,320
Okay. Here we go again.

2
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,075
Let me break it down for you:

3
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,203
Four thousand soldiers...

4
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,416
a 250-man team
of Colombia's elite forces...

5
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,296
tens of thousands of rounds fired...

6
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,593
...seven dogs...

7
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,387
...and four fuckin' helicopters.

8
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:59,017
Pablo Escobar was surrounded
in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

9
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,772
There was no way
he was getting out of this one... right?

10
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:08,276
Hey, Jimenez. Do you think
the Special Forces guys killed him?

11
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,320
If he can even be killed, that is.

12
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,994
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

13
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,832
I don't know.
I heard they shot him 20 times.

14
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,710
They pumped him full of lead.

15
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,130
Then they burned his body
and spread his ashes all over Medellín.

16
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:35,053
They say that he rose from the ashes,

17
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,264
and he went to the houses
of each of the men who had shot him,

18
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,142
and he killed them as they slept.

19
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,519
Bullshit.

20
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,479
Quiet! Someone's coming.

21
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,000
We're soldiers from the National Army!

22
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,276
Stop and identify yourselves!

23
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,695
We're well armed!

24
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,547
Mr. Escobar.

25
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,342
I'm sorry, but we've been ordered
to not let you through.

26
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,845
We have to take you into custody.

27
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,940
Son, I'm sorry to say...

28
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,195
unfortunately,
I can't allow that to happen.

29
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,539
Excuse me.

30
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,180
You don't speak a word of this to anyone,
understood?

31
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,784
Yep.

32
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,997
Life ain't fair, man.

33
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,376
Pablo Escobar? He was headed home.

34
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,130
As for me and Connie, well,
we were in some deep shit,

35
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,715
and I hadn't even heard the news.

36
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,050
This is what I do. This is my job.

37
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,469
No, don't you dare say this is your job.

38
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,680
I know what your fucking job is.

39
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:09,058
And it doesn't entail being kidnapped
by a Colombian drug cartel.

40
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,894
Listen, I'm sorry, I am.
I know it must've been tough for you.

41
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,940
Listen, but Connie,
I was never in any danger.

42
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,276
I'm here now, back with you.

43
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,279
Hmm?

44
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,868
All I want... is for us to be safe.

45
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,808
I want to get the hell out of this place
and I want to go home.

46
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,924
- Murphy.
- Escobar's out.

47
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,260
- What?
- He's fucking out.

48
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:49,640
He took Sandoval hostage during the siege
and when the army went in... he escaped.

49
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,017
Walked right out.

50
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,400
Pick me up in ten minutes.
I'll meet you downstairs.

51
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,659
Escobar's escaped.

52
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,375
And you know what?

53
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,253
I was happy about it.

54
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,008
The fox was out of the cage
and the hunt was on.

55
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,640
Yeah, it was the biggest
law enforcement blunder of all time.

56
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,101
Fortunately, it wasn't our blunder.

57
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,685
This...

58
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,921
is an enormous embarrassment
for all of Colombia, gentlemen.

59
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,485
So...

60
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,405
- how will we proceed?
- Mr. President...

61
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:54,789
Mr. President, Escobar will surely attempt
to reestablish himself within the city,

62
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,459
and we can't allow him and his sicarios
to move freely.

63
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,004
So my recommendation, Mr. President,
is that we occupy Medellín.

64
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,758
Flood the streets with officers.
Conduct searches.

65
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,554
Close down the streets.
Establish vehicle checkpoints.

66
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,397
Pressure him until he appears,
Mr. President.

67
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,474
And who would conduct such an operation?

68
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,601
Colonel Pinzón, sir.

69
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,606
- He should begin immediately.
- Of course, Mr. President.

70
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,652
Are you injured?

71
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,530
No, I'm not hurt.

72
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,073
You know I couldn't talk to him.

73
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,659
I couldn't negotiate with Escobar.

74
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,581
- I understand.
- Why did you go inside?

75
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,708
I sensed something was off.

76
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,587
Ariza said his orders were
to secure the perimeter, that's all.

77
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,881
Well, he lied. I gave the order myself.

78
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,593
Go home and get some rest,
but come back soon.

79
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,888
You know you're the only person
I can trust.

80
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,098
Yes, sir.

81
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,735
It's all right, Tata. I'll be right back.
Excuse me, Doña Hermilda.

82
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,947
Boss.

83
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,094
- It's good to see you.
- It's great to have you back home.

84
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,703
Very good to see you.

85
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,914
He's here. It's him.

86
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,751
- Praise the Lord. I knew it. I knew it.
- How are you, brother?

87
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,169
Pablo!

88
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,010
Thank God.

89
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,555
- Oh, my son!
- How are you?

90
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,991
- I'm all right.
- You're all right?

91
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,391
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

92
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,060
- You're all right?
- I'm all right.

93
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,403
- I did everything I could, Dad.
- I know.

94
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,739
I know.

95
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,783
I am very proud.

96
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,869
I love you very much.

97
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,423
It's Dad.

98
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,596
...you and your family. May he always
protect you in his holy glory.

99
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,181
Thank you very much.

100
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,308
You're great boys.

101
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,025
- Monitor the police frequencies.
- Yes.

102
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,320
And don't bother me unless it's necessary.

103
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,030
As you wish, boss.

104
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,700
Very good.

105
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,412
Very good, gentlemen.

106
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,664
Very good.

107
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,774
Please take the things out of the car
and organize them over there.

108
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,612
I felt I'd lost you.

109
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,616
You're never going to lose me.

110
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,954
And what now, Pablo?

111
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,831
What will we do now?

112
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:29,629
I did... what I had to do, Tata.

113
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,799
I'll take care of it.

114
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:40,139
We'll be fine, and content,

115
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:44,185
and happy, and together and united.

116
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,478
But...

117
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,897
Always.

118
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,075
Always.

119
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,663
- Tell me you'll never leave me.
- Never.

120
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,999
Promise.

121
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,088
I promise.

122
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,051
I promise, my love.

123
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,284
Pablo Escobar has escaped from prison.

124
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,545
He is out of that prison again
after a bizarre showdown between...

125
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,672
By morning,
word was out on the streets

126
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,799
and all eyes were on Medellín.

127
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,053
This wasn't just a manhunt...
this was an invasion.

128
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,766
Gaviria was willing to go
door to door to catch Escobar.

129
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,643
And we wanted to be a part of it.

130
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,690
After all,
we represented America down here.

131
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:16,110
We thought of ourselves
as the guys who could get shit done.

132
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,113
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Jesus Christ.

133
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,117
Agent Murphy, Agent Peña. DEA.

134
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,037
I understand you're from
the DEA, but I have to ask Colonel Pinzón.

135
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,164
Wait one moment.

136
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,126
- Name Pinzón mean anything to you?
- No, don't know him.

137
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,255
You see this?

138
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,526
Well, it looks like we're not invited
to the dance.

139
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,344
Gentlemen, wait here for a moment.

140
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,389
We'll let you in once the area is secured,
understood?

141
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,633
Yeah, you mean when nothing's left inside.

142
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,395
We're going to have to move everything.

143
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,524
- What do you mean by "everything"?
- Everything. The labs...

144
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:02,740
the offices, the hideouts, the deposits...
we're moving everything.

145
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,825
Boss, even the labs?

146
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,786
They're well-guarded. There's no problem.

147
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,041
Come on, don't you know
what's going on at La Catedral?

148
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:16,712
The cops are going through all of the maps
and documents you idiots left behind.

149
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,923
Now we can't trust anyone, you bastards.

150
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,109
Who are you calling a bastard,
you son of a bitch? Huh?

151
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,970
We're... moving... everything.

152
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,432
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

153
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,142
Yes, Don Pablo.

154
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,603
We're also going to need more men.

155
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,023
Last night we lost a lot of brothers.

156
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,152
- May they rest in peace.
- Amen.

157
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,741
And one last thing.

158
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,996
I'm going to need a good driver with a
clean record to drive me around the city.

159
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,794
He needs to be smart, fearless, and loyal.

160
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,214
- Done, boss.
- Boss, I'm sorry,

161
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,634
but you can't risk yourself like that.

162
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,178
Yes, Don Pablo, I agree with Velasco.

163
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,725
I want people to know that Pablo Escobar
doesn't hide like a rat.

164
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,814
Because we...

165
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:22,403
are the Medellín cartel, motherfucker!

166
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,280
Now keep in mind...

167
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,575
the Medellín cartel
wasn't just one big gang.

168
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,452
It was made up of a bunch
of smaller gangs.

169
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,288
A collective, so to speak.

170
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,333
And as far as Pablo was concerned,
he was still their leader.

171
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,504
In his mind, every trafficker in Medellín
had to pay tribute to him.

172
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,883
Only a guy who'd killed
thousands of people

173
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,803
could think Judy Moncada would forget
what he'd done to her husband Kiko

174
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,431
and his business partner Fernando Galeano,

175
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,309
the guys who were running his business
while he was inside.

176
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,687
Fuckin' psycho. He thought
that they were stealing from him...

177
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,857
and naturally,
they got the short end of the stick.

178
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,983
Pablo, no!

179
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,198
You believe whatever the fuck
you want to believe, you son of a bitch!

180
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,409
Why he thought Judy'd be okay with that...

181
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,078
Well, she wasn't.

182
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:18,292
And alongside her brother Jaime,
and head of security Diego Murillo,

183
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:23,380
a.k.a. Don Berna, they'd broken away
from the Medellín cartel.

184
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,217
And now that Pablo was out,
they wanted payback.

185
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,223
And as for the other gangs,
they were all up for grabs.

186
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,812
Take the Prisco brothers, for instance.

187
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,689
The oldest of whom, Ricardo,

188
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,108
was a respected member
of the medical community.

189
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,908
He didn't know who to side with.

190
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,327
Neither did the Gallón gang,

191
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,954
who became famous a year later

192
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,248
when they murdered Colombian soccer player
Andrés Escobar

193
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:03,003
for accidentally scoring a goal against
his own country in the 1994 World Cup.

194
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,800
But this wasn't a soccer game.
This was the blow business.

195
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:13,305
And whose side they chose would come down
to two things: who offered the better deal

196
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,641
and who had the better chance
of winning the war.

197
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,519
This again? Stop obsessing. Relax.

198
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,813
Relax? What do you want me to do?

199
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,941
Should I sit here and wait for Pablo
to walk through that door

200
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,152
and kill me and my daughter?
He's going to come and kill you, too.

201
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,798
- What do you think about that?
- Pablo won't be killing anyone, all right?

202
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,825
Jaime, what country do you live in?

203
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,744
If he hasn't killed anyone yet,
he's planning on it.

204
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:41,250
Haven't you noticed, Berna?
Judy, haven't you noticed?

205
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,877
Gaviria's got this city
swarming with cops.

206
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,880
There's a cop
on every fucking street corner.

207
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,925
Pablo can't move.

208
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,929
Then we have to find and kill the bastard
before the police find him.

209
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,514
Judy, listen.

210
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,600
Listen to me! Listen!

211
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:03,105
Pablo, right now, it's like
he's like a caged rat. Understand?

212
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,732
Jaime.

213
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,403
Despite everything, you still don't know
what Pablo's capable of?

214
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:13,407
- He's someone we can't underestimate.
- You said it, Berna.

215
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,410
They shouldn't underestimate us either.

216
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,662
And Pablo's got very few friends left,
and you know it.

217
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,373
Pablo will always have friends.

218
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,794
Berna, I want everyone to know
what happened to Kiko.

219
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:32,259
It should be clear
that being loyal to Escobar

220
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,511
will only earn you a bullet in the head.

221
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,807
They'll know what side
they should be on, right?

222
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,184
Judy...

223
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,438
what do we do with the labs?

224
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,859
What do you suggest?

225
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,656
I think we shut down the labs,
at least for a while.

226
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,996
We have to lay low
until Pablo is killed or captured.

227
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,292
That's stupid, Berna.
Tell me how that makes any sense. Huh?

228
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,088
A lot of other people also stopped
paying Pablo at the same time as us.

229
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,256
Let's join forces with them.

230
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,551
There's the Priscos, for example.
Last night I met with Ricardo.

231
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,261
I'll talk to him.

232
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,181
Jaime, be very careful with those people.

233
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,105
- Hello?
- Okay?

234
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,107
- That looks nice.
- One moment.

235
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,399
Ricardo?

236
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,738
Don Pablo.

237
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,703
Of course. There was no decision to make.

238
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,832
You know that you can always count on us.

239
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,678
Sweetie!

240
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,682
Hey!

241
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,850
Fag!

242
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,435
What's going on, Limón?

243
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,689
- Son of a bitch.
- How's it going, brother? Good or what?

244
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:13,694
Quica, my love, come give me
the best 20 minutes of my life.

245
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,779
What are you doing here? Are you going in?

246
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,990
No, brother.
I didn't come to see the whores.

247
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,784
- Then what?
- I came to see you, brother.

248
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,244
Mmm-hmm.

249
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,499
And from what I can see,
you're still driving whores everywhere.

250
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,501
You know how it is. I have to pay rent.

251
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,714
Listen, Limón,
don't you want to make good money?

252
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,257
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm?

253
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,675
Doing what?

254
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,846
- The same thing, brother.
- Driving who?

255
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,765
Pablo Escobar, brother.

256
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:48,854
- Eat shit, you son of a bitch.
- Limón, I'm serious, brother.

257
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,983
The boss asked us to find someone...

258
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,403
someone clean, who the police don't know.

259
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,156
He would go in the trunk.

260
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:05,579
- Where would I have to take him?
- Wherever he wants to go. You don't ask.

261
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,830
Mmm.

262
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,416
What do you think, brother?

263
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,879
There's cops everywhere.

264
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,924
Why don't we put a girl in the back
so no one gets suspicious?

265
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,930
- Which one of the whores do you trust?
- They're whores, brother.

266
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,432
Then who, brother?

267
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,976
- No!
- No?

268
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,646
- Thank you.
- Why not, Maritza?

269
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,981
- No.
- Hmm? What's wrong with it? Nothing.

270
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,401
- I'm very busy, Jhon.
- That doesn't matter, Maritza.

271
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,570
Yes?

272
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,782
Ask one of the girls
you drive around all day.

273
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,659
- I can't.
- Get out of my way.

274
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,537
Maritza... I need you to do it.

275
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,582
It'll be the easiest money
you'll make in your life.

276
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,460
You can quit your second job, understand?

277
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,303
You'll be able to take care
of your daughter.

278
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,506
Haven't I always done right by you?

279
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,093
I've always helped you
and your family, right? So?

280
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,804
Right?

281
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,642
You're a son of a bitch, you know?

282
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,355
So what? Hmm?

283
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,877
- And who's that?
- He's a friend. He's trustworthy.

284
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,214
What's up, Quica?
This is the girl I told you about.

285
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,805
Let's go.

286
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,808
Take care, skinny!

287
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,062
- All good?
- All good, brother.

288
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,522
I'll follow you, brother.

289
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,192
- Who's that bitch?
- Close your fucking legs, Rosa.

290
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,028
You'll kill all the flowers.

291
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,072
You shit-eating bastard.
This pussy smells great.

292
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,035
Now you're going to the market
to buy your whores, you bastard?

293
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,786
Don't get pissy.

294
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,081
If you're in a better mood
when I come back this afternoon,

295
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,499
you'll get to fuck me.

296
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,295
Fucking Quica.

297
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,381
Shut up! Go inside! Watch yourself!

298
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,557
Looking for a place
for your next corporate retreat?

299
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,560
Or maybe a quiet getaway
for the whole family?

300
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:39,483
How about 360 degrees of unobstructed
views of the Antioquian countryside?

301
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,987
Sixty thousand square feet
of creative living space.

302
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,701
Perfect for entertaining.

303
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,498
Look no further than La Catedral.

304
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,666
One man's prison...

305
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,711
is anyone else's palace.

306
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,301
Yep... it was a beautiful place.

307
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,720
And when the Colombian cops
were done with it,

308
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,765
they were gracious enough
to let us pick through the leftovers.

309
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,563
This and Mein Kampf.

310
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,483
Two classics of 20th century literature.

311
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,361
Yeah, what do you think the rent's like?
I'm thinking about moving in.

312
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,618
Hey, Javi, you think the, uh... the Hague
would want a couple of these?

313
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,746
How are you not wearing rubber gloves
touching that shit, man?

314
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,874
We should take this stuff to our office.
It's better than any of the shit we got.

315
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:53,014
Fuckin' Pinzón's guys have taken
everything that's useful. There's nothing.

316
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,978
Look, I think I found something
that might help.

317
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,434
Oh, yeah?

318
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,061
What's that?

319
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,943
Wait.

320
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,664
Ready? Close your eyes.

321
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,082
That's right.

322
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,880
It's a little bunny, my love.
She's very delicate.

323
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,467
Boss?

324
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,403
Look, Don Pablo...

325
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:52,073
this is the guy
I've been telling you about, Limón.

326
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,450
He's Guarazapo's cousin.

327
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:59,581
Limón! Come here, brother. Come on!

328
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,714
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

329
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,676
Don't worry, boss.
We've known each other for a long time.

330
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,888
Besides, he's never had any run-ins
with police. He's clean.

331
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,681
And where are you from, son?

332
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,351
I was born in Envigado, sir.

333
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,394
My mother lives in the barrio
you built for us.

334
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,398
I'm very glad.

335
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,360
- What about the girl?
- She...

336
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,153
She's a friend, boss.

337
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,907
We went to school together in Envigado.
I know her very well

338
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,911
and I know where she works,
so she's someone we can trust, boss.

339
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,581
Listen, Limón...

340
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,629
Do you know what it means to work for me?

341
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,131
It's an honor to work for you, Don Pablo.

342
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,052
You've done so much
for the poor in Medellín...

343
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,765
if I have to lose my life for you...

344
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,977
I will, boss.

345
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,399
All right.

346
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,321
Open the trunk.

347
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,622
After La Catedral,
the next stop was Carlos Holguín...

348
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,460
the old police training academy
that had been repurposed as ground zero

349
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,379
in the search for Escobar.

350
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,717
The new honcho was Colonel Pinzón,

351
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,803
the guy who was famous
for his love of Uncle Sam.

352
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,471
As a courtesy to your government,

353
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,182
I'm allowing you to participate
in this manhunt.

354
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:46,313
But... I set the limits
and all decisions rest with me.

355
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:50,275
If this condition is unacceptable,
take it up with the president.

356
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,610
Of course, Colonel.

357
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,446
I hope we didn't get off
on the wrong foot.

358
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,991
Not at all. Every operation
needs a well-defined hierarchy.

359
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,964
I hope this will be an adequate space
for you to do your work.

360
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,427
- What, you're talking about this? This...
- This is more than adequate.

361
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,057
- Gracias, Colonel.
- Welcome.

362
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,397
Oh, wow, this is from 1962.

363
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,365
Like most tricks Pablo employed,

364
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:42,535
the audacity and simplicity of the taxi
was pretty damn good.

365
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:46,623
I mean, who in the hell would think
that the seventh richest man in the world

366
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,667
would be riding around in the trunk
of a piece of shit taxi?

367
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,961
Don't worry, brother. Everything's good.

368
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:56,424
As smart as it was, Pablo wasn't the
kind of guy who left anything to chance.

369
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,470
Despite his absence, he still
had a loyal following in Medellín.

370
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,559
And a network of spotters... kids mainly.

371
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,479
And they were everywhere in the comunas.

372
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,775
The spotters could identify
which streets to take

373
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,902
and which ones to avoid.

374
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,614
All yours.

375
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,087
Where are we?

376
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,303
- What the fuck are we doing here, Jhon?
- Get down and hide.

377
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,556
- Jhon, I don't...
- Shit, Maritza,

378
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,850
I don't have time
to give you explanations.

379
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,351
Just do it, all right?

380
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,885
Don Pablo.

381
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,428
- Hello.
- Welcome.

382
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,639
Thank you. No, don't get up. Don't get up.

383
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,767
- How are you?
- Very well.

384
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,393
Great, I'm very glad.

385
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,356
- Rojas.
- Don Pablo.

386
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,816
- Sir.
- How have you been?

387
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,461
Well, sir. How are you?
I wasn't expecting you.

388
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,528
- I'm well. Very well.
- Guys, please.

389
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,113
Yes, sir.

390
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,199
- Don Pablo.
- Do you want anything to drink, sir?

391
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,301
- A coffee?
- No, thank you.

392
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,745
- Can I get you anything?
- Thank you, I'm fine.

393
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,625
- How are you?
- I'm well, sir. Everything is well.

394
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,795
- How is Maribel?
- Maribel is well, sir. Thank you.

395
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,463
Good, brother.

396
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,965
What's going on with the deposits?

397
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,206
They're looking a little light.

398
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,262
Well, after everything
that happened with...

399
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:11,184
with Mr. Galeano
and Mr. Moncada, well...

400
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,770
people are nervous, you understand?

401
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:18,566
This woman, Judy Moncada,
has been talking to people.

402
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,611
Not everyone wants to pay.

403
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,613
Mmm.

404
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,327
- So that's it?
- That's it, sir. I thought you knew.

405
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,414
- I told them to tell you...
- Calm down. Don't worry about that.

406
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,669
We'll fix that problem soon.

407
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,962
Yes, sir.

408
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,341
In the meantime...

409
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,971
I want you to move
to the offices in Laureles.

410
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,474
It's no longer safe here.

411
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,269
- Done, sir. Whatever you say.
- Good.

412
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,688
And fill this up, please.

413
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,160
Don Pablo!

414
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,162
- Sir, how are...
- Is that you?

415
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,373
- How are you, sir?
- Sweetie! Sweetie!

416
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,835
Sweetie!
Don Pablo is in front of our house.

417
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,295
Don Pablo?

418
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,231
- Don Pablo!
- Hello, ma'am. How are you?

419
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,673
- Fine, and you?
- I'm well.

420
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,967
- It's him, old man.
- Sir, how are you?

421
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,386
- How is your health?
- It's good. Very good!

422
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,930
Good. Good. How are all of you?
Good? Good?

423
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,599
- How are you, Don Pablo?
- Good.

424
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,100
- It's him.
- How are you?

425
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,685
- In the flesh?
- How are you, son?

426
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:39,188
- Good?
- Boss, we should get going.

427
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,983
Let them see me. Let them see me.

428
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,003
- I never thought I'd meet you in person.
- How are you?

429
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,778
I'm well, ma'am, how are you?

430
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:50,241
- Here, boss, behind you.
- Here. Let's see.

431
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,453
- Generous as always, Don Pablo.
- For you.

432
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,497
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- For the doctor, sir. For the doctor.

433
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,875
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- Take care of yourself.

434
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,170
For you, ma'am.

435
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,047
For you too, sir.

436
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,199
Seriously? Directly in front of me?

437
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,242
I don't spend enough time
looking at your face?

438
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,538
That's better.

439
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,127
There's a girl on line three.
She wants to talk to an American.

440
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,548
Nothing?

441
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:52,428
You picked up the "American" part, right?

442
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,640
Murphy!

443
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,977
- What's wrong, brother?
- Suck my dick, please.

444
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,775
- DEA, Agent Peña.
- Pay attention.

445
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,779
I know where you can find
one of Escobar's men.

446
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,156
Oh, yeah? Which one?

447
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,243
There's a reward, right?

448
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,037
Yes, there's a reward.

449
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,165
What's your information, miss?
Who are you talking about?

450
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,586
La Quica.

451
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,757
La Quica?

452
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,927
You know La Quica?

453
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,596
He came to the brothel on 23rd street.

454
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,349
He left with a man in a taxi
and said he would return later.

455
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,102
Do you work there?

456
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,732
Yes.

457
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,900
How long ago was this?

458
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,487
A couple of hours ago.

459
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,282
All right, we'll look into it.

460
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,704
- You think it's legit?
- Let's find out.

461
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,927
How credible is your source?

462
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,681
It was an unsolicited phone call.
She asked to speak to an American.

463
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,701
We would just need a couple of cars
and a few men.

464
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,770
Well, my men are either busy here
or outside in the street.

465
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,981
And I'm not relocating men
to chase down bullshit tips.

466
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,109
If this turns out not to be bullshit,
La Quica could give us Pablo.

467
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,405
So go. Go ahead.

468
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,908
Since when do you need an excuse
to go to a whorehouse?

469
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,163
It would be worth investigating, Colonel.

470
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,415
We're not asking for a lot.

471
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,298
One vehicle, three men.

472
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,591
Gracias.

473
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,074
Did you close the lab?

474
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,894
Jesus Christ.

475
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:08,314
No, Berna, and I won't
because it's not necessary.

476
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,985
- Listen to me, Jaime...
- No, you listen to me. Enough of this.

477
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,363
I already spoke with
Ricardo Prisco, all right?

478
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,865
He's with us. He supports us.

479
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,469
Everything is firm. Everything is good.
What more could we want?

480
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,788
I told you to be careful
with those people, Jaime.

481
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,997
Pay attention to me.

482
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,709
First, these guys have been with us
since Pablo killed Kiko, right?

483
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,462
Second, Ricardo knows
that being loyal to Pablo

484
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,172
means a bullet in the head, brother.

485
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:37,593
And third, and to ease your mind,
they're sending us men, for security...

486
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:38,970
What?

487
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,306
So you gave these people
the address to the lab?

488
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,184
Don't be an idiot.
How else would they get here?

489
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,437
Jaime, listen to me.

490
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,732
Get out of there now.
Get moving and come here right now!

491
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,896
Listen to me, Berna!
Stop with the paranoia, brother!

492
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,822
Jaime! Jaime! Get out now!

493
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,824
- Come here now!
- Come play, motherfuckers!

494
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,661
Jaime! Jaime!

495
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,745
Get out now!

496
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,502
What's going on, Ricardo?

497
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,423
You're fucking up, man.

498
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,593
Ricardo, put the gun down, brother.

499
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,138
Ricardo, put it down.
Pablo is weak right now, brother.

500
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,182
You know this.

501
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,601
The city's filled with cops.

502
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,979
Pablo can't move, brother.

503
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,732
Ricardo, put the gun down.

504
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,282
Hello, Jaime.

505
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,619
Jaime.

506
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,955
- Berna, how have you been?
- Who's this?

507
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,919
This is Pablo speaking. I imagine
you want to talk to Jaime, right?

508
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,506
Berna, help me, man.

509
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,427
Berna, talk to Pablo.
Explain everything, Berna! Help me!

510
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,887
Pablo, no! Wait!

511
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,939
And now, you fat son of a bitch...

512
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:18,486
we're coming after you
and that bitch you protect.

513
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,822
Pablo, you've just made
the biggest mistake.

514
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,616
Tell the others...

515
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,492
Who is it?

516
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:30,456
...that Pablo Escobar is to be respected,

517
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,166
you son of a bitch.

518
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,901
That son of a bitch!
His entire family, do you understand?

519
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,011
I want everyone
in his fucking family dead!

520
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,389
That fat fuck!

521
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,308
Son of a bitch!

522
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,811
Listen, Judy...

523
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,483
I'm very sorry about Jaime, and I'm very
sorry about all of these deaths.

524
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:01,112
We have to accept that we lost this time.

525
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,950
But you know what?
I'll be with you until the end.

526
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:10,246
And if you want to go ahead on
against Pablo, just say so.

527
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:16,127
We'll find strong allies. And people.
We'll need a lot of people.

528
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,547
Yes.

529
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,973
You're right.

530
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,060
Yes.

531
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,317
I think we have to see things
for what they are.

532
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,694
The truth of the matter, just as it is.

533
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,197
And this is the truth, Berna:

534
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,036
I know of someone who's very powerful.

535
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,373
Someone who wants to kill Pablo
as much as I do.

536
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,678
Alleys run
along the house here... and here.

537
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,514
We'll keep the other car
waiting around back.

538
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:14,185
- You sure it's not a trap?
- I'm not sure of anything.

539
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,110
- Murphy.
- Hey, it's me.

540
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,071
Hey, honey. Um...

541
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,034
I'm just in the middle
of something. Let me call you right back.

542
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,326
We're at the airport.

543
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,162
You're where?

544
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,372
I can't do this.

545
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,875
I'm taking Olivia
and we're going back to Miami.

546
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,561
No, no, no. Listen to me, please.

547
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,171
Please, you can't just do it like this.
You can't.

548
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:45,925
My sister's offered to help us out for
a while, so we'll be there if you need us.

549
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:46,842
Connie.

550
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,304
It's not right, Steve, to keep Olivia here
with everything that's going on.

551
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,098
Not when I can take her someplace safe.

552
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,951
You're safe in Bogotá. You're right beside
the goddamn fuckin' embassy.

553
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,375
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Look, I have to go.

554
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:01,440
Connie, please. We can talk about this.
Do not get on that airplane. Wait, okay?

555
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,876
I'll be right there. I'm on my way.

556
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,486
I'm sorry.

557
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,491
Hey, hey, hey. I'm here. Okay?

558
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,954
- She's at the airport.
- Go.

559
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:18,332
I'm sorry. I gotta go. Guys, sorry.

560
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,085
All right.

561
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,787
Hello, Fernando.

562
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,043
You did very well, sister.

563
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,881
Look... you don't just get two,
you get three.

564
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:14,430
You have a special talent, and that's why
you get three instead of two green ones.

565
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:25,024
What are you doing tonight, sweetie?
I know of a nice calm place.

566
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,485
We could have fun.

567
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,906
I can't.
I have to take care of my daughter.

568
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:39,121
- Bitch. Give me 30 minutes, Limón.
- All right, brother.

569
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,249
I'm going to fuck one of them.

570
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,629
Sweetie...

571
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,216
Thank you, Maritza.

572
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,184
Bastard.

573
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,713
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

574
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,717
- Flight to Miami.
- Gate 39, but... Sir, you can't go. Sir!

575
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,321
I'm DEA. I need to get on this flight.

576
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,556
I'm sorry, sir... Sir, I'm sorry,
but the plane has already left.

577
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,853
Sir, please. You can't be here.

578
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,772
Sir!

579
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,948
Right here,
to the right. It's the next right.

580
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,450
Know the area well, don't you, Peña?

581
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,411
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

582
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,204
Just fuckin' drive.

583
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,320
Enjoy.

584
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,498
- Get you feeling pretty good?
- Huh?

585
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,419
Oh, fuck. Thanks, man. Shit.

586
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,713
Phew!

587
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,008
You wouldn't imagine
what a kilo of that stuff cost.

588
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,469
Come on.

589
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,221
- How about you, golden boy?
- What are you talking about, man?

590
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,850
Time it's processed, shipped,

591
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:10,939
distributed to your buddies on...
the Upper East Side? Yeah.

592
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:14,401
Hey, man, we don't need
any problems here. We cool?

593
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,327
Six.

594
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,829
Lives.

595
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,957
That's how much it cost.

596
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,751
What do you think about that?

597
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,505
That was six people.
Six people were murdered

598
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:38,092
every time you
and your buddy over there...

599
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,345
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah?

600
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,855
Whoo!

601
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,830
Yeah? You like that? Yeah?

602
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:14,461
There's the taxi. Park on the left. There.

603
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,304
Calm down! Calm down!

604
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,641
Okay, let's go.

605
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,271
All right. Wait for me here.

606
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,211
- Trujillo!
- Go around! Go around!

607
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,046
Move! Move! Move!

608
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,842
Move! Move! Move!

609
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,218
Quica!

610
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,429
Brother!

611
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,514
God damn it. What?

612
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,725
- Quica! Quica!
- What's the problem, brother?

613
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,602
Let's go, brother. Hurry up!

614
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,319
Brother! Hurry, Quica!

615
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,388
They're cops, brother! Run!

616
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,569
That way.

617
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,192
Stop looking.
This is the best place to eat.

618
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,739
Fuck.

619
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,742
Fuck.

620
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,083
The situation is that...

621
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:03,630
your escape has left us without...
We don't have a lot of options.

622
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,508
If I hadn't escaped,
they would have killed me, Fernando.

623
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,596
Or I'd rot in an American jail.

624
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:17,561
- You will tell Gaviria...
- Gaviria is being crucified by the media.

625
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,106
I don't think it's a good time.

626
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:27,070
You will tell Gaviria...

627
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:36,705
I am willing to go back to La Catedral
to finish my sentence.

628
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,332
As you wish.

629
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,419
- Tomorrow morning, I'll return to Bogotá...
- No, no, no, brother.

630
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,507
We can't...

631
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,513
leave for tomorrow what we can do today.
Right?

632
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,359
Mr. President,
Mr. Fernando Duque is on the line.

633
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,865
- I don't have anything to say to him.
- I'll handle it. You go ahead.

634
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,912
Mr. Duque. Eduardo Sandoval speaking.

635
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:21,041
Mr. Vice Minister, I have an important
message from Mr. Escobar.

636
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:28,006
He says he's willing to negotiate the
conditions for his return to La Catedral.

637
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,260
Turn on the television.

638
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:43,230
- What did he say?
- He told us to turn on the television.

639
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,254
Good evening, compatriots.

640
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:13,760
In the last year and a half, we've
enjoyed the peace we'd long awaited...

641
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,178
for over a decade.

642
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,182
Now we can go to work,

643
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:23,937
drop our children off at school,
and enjoy life's small pleasures...

644
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:29,067
without the threat of violence
looming around every corner.

645
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:34,156
This peace is now threatened
by virtue of Pablo Escobar's escape.

646
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:40,370
Escobar has been named
the bloodiest narcoterrorist of all time.

647
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,709
This history... changes today.

648
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,755
But I need your help.

649
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:54,801
We must come together as a people,
as a country,

650
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,263
so his reign of terror comes to an end,
here and now.

651
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,976
This is why I'm before you now...

652
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:08,732
offering a reward of $1.4 million

653
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:12,486
for whoever gives information
leading to his capture.

654
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:18,283
It is my hope that through this reward...

655
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:23,538
the day will finally come when our country
is free of Pablo's grip

656
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:29,336
and will cease to be held hostage
by terror, intimidation...

657
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,297
and murder.

658
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,716
I want to make it very clear...

659
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,803
that under no circumstances...

660
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,640
will I negotiate with Pablo Escobar.
