1
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,138
Get down!

2
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,531
One!

3
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,663
- Rosa! Rosa!
- Quica...

4
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:08,169
Tell me who talked to the police!
Who talked to them? Huh?

5
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:12,132
It had to be that whore
in the market. Please, Quica!

6
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,096
Imagine this:

7
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,516
President of Colombia goes on TV
and tells the whole world

8
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,434
he'll never make a deal with you.

9
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,980
Now a normal person thinks, "I'm fucked."

10
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,858
But Pablo Escobar,
he thinks that's just your opening offer.

11
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,112
So the man finds a way to respond.

12
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,200
Thanks for accepting the invitation.

13
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,454
Forgive me for the hood.

14
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,623
It's for security reasons.

15
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,584
- I hope you understand.
- I understand.

16
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,546
Can I offer you something? Coffee, water?

17
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,924
No, I'm fine, thank you.

18
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,592
Let's begin, then.

19
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,652
- Do you regret going to jail a year ago?
- Absolutely not.

20
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:24,574
In fact, what I regret least
is having escaped.

21
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,243
The Special Forces came in
and opened fire.

22
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,996
I couldn't risk putting my life
in their hands, right?

23
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,790
However...

24
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,253
I hope this interview
makes it clear to the president...

25
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:42,717
I am willing to return to any prison
in the District of Antioquia.

26
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,304
The most modest and the most humble.

27
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,199
But before that, I have to examine
the conditions they are going to put me in

28
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:53,978
because, look, it would be easy,
for example, for someone to rig a car bomb

29
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,855
that would explode when I arrived.

30
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,400
And how did Gaviria take Pablo's offer?

31
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,447
I think it's safe to say
that he didn't really care for it.

32
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,992
But it wasn't just Gaviria
Pablo was talking to.

33
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,579
In his mind, he was also negotiating
with the leader of the free world.

34
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:16,751
It turns out that my problem
turned into a political problem.

35
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,420
It appears that I am very important

36
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,744
to the re-election
of the President of the United States.

37
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:26,385
You see, the problem was,
George Bush had his own plans for Escobar.

38
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,970
We will, for the first time,

39
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,225
make available the appropriate resources
of America's armed forces.

40
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:36,020
And for the drug kingpins,
the death penalty.

41
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:40,483
And with a commander in chief
who used to be the head of the CIA,

42
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,151
well, you can use your imagination

43
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,696
as to what "appropriate resources"
might mean.

44
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,575
He started by appointing a new ambassador.

45
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,579
Badass former Navy man, Arthur Crosby...

46
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,043
who specialized in Latin American affairs
and counterterrorism.

47
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,924
Next, he dug into his old CIA Rolodex,

48
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,427
where there was no shortage of guys
who knew how to fight dirty.

49
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,723
And he sent us one of those, too.

50
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:20,731
Lastly, and what Peña and I like to call
his own personal "fuck you" to us...

51
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:26,112
he sent us something
he thought we must need: a boss.

52
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:31,701
Now just how long that person
would be my boss remained to be seen.

53
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:37,957
I will always be ready to pay for
my mistakes and accept a humble jail cell

54
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,252
when my rights are respected

55
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:46,215
and they guarantee me that I will not
be transferred anywhere for any reason.

56
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,929
Do you acknowledge that
you have committed crimes in the past,

57
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,140
or that you ordered someone's death?

58
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,775
That answer one could
only give to a priest.

59
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,903
In a confessional.

60
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,368
Marietta.

61
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,413
- What's up?
- What happened?

62
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:22,460
It looks like they killed them.
I think there were six or seven girls.

63
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,629
Who would do something so horrible?

64
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,100
Are you, by nature, violent and proud?

65
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,313
Those who know me
know I have a great sense of humor.

66
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,776
I would say that I'm a happy man.

67
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,986
I've always been happy.
I've always been optimistic.

68
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,863
I've always had faith in life.

69
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,574
I always sing in the shower.

70
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,827
How do you think the story
of Pablo Escobar will end?

71
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:06,587
Well... one can never know.
I can only hope for the best.

72
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,012
I would like to die on my own two feet.

73
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,892
In the year 3047.

74
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,563
My title might be "ambassador,"

75
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,232
but that's some bullshit
politician's word.

76
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,609
I know what it means
to be on the front lines.

77
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:34,407
And everybody in this room wants
the same thing: to take down Escobar.

78
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,911
Now as a veteran of numerous conflicts,
I learned one immutable truth:

79
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,877
the only way to succeed
is by working together,

80
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,792
by communicating,
by sharing intelligence and collaborating.

81
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,419
Understood?

82
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,799
Uh, this is Claudia Messina.
She is the new DEA country attaché.

83
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,094
She'll be taking over all DEA operations
in-country. Messina?

84
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,971
Thank you, Ambassador.

85
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:02,810
The DEA will be opening field offices
in Cali, Cartagena and Barranquilla.

86
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,313
As far as the Medellín team is concerned,

87
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:09,191
they will be housed out of
CNP headquarters until further notice.

88
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,902
But only after some personnel changes
have been made.

89
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,739
All right, now as far as
long-term intelligence is concerned,

90
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,826
that's under the purview of the CIA,
the station chief, Bill Stechner.

91
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,554
Bill, you have anything you'd like to add?

92
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,954
I'm good.

93
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,961
- All right, who's here from Centra Spike?
- I am, sir. Edward Jacoby.

94
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,398
All right, let's get Centra Spike
back in the air immediately.

95
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,466
I want to know every word
these assholes say

96
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,429
and all information flows through me
and I will disseminate as I see fit.

97
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,595
Yes, sir.

98
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:42,308
When Escobar sticks his fucking head out,
we're gonna nail that son of a bitch.

99
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,187
What about him? Other than
the fact that he wasn't here today.

100
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,439
Well, I suggested that he stay home.

101
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,026
You mentioned making some changes.
What exactly does that mean?

102
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,528
It means I'm making some changes.

103
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,965
Murphy's a good agent.
He's done a lot of good work down here.

104
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,074
Yeah.

105
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,036
Looks like it.

106
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,210
Do you have any idea
the strings that were pulled

107
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,961
to get that guy not to press charges?

108
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,398
Sounds to me like the guy
would've had a dog sniffing up his ass

109
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,622
before he got on the plane.
Maybe Steve did him a favor.

110
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,551
Was that a thank you?

111
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,140
Be straight with me, Agent Peña,
and I'll be straight with you.

112
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,976
I don't need a guy like that
making my life more difficult.

113
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,062
- And making the DEA look bad.
- Ma'am...

114
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:31,232
Messina. Or boss.

115
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,900
We've been down here a long time.

116
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,985
You've been down here all of what,
two hours?

117
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,991
It may not make the front page, but...

118
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,036
a lot of the intel we have
is because of Steve.

119
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,998
He's a good man.
He's going through some shit right now.

120
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,976
You know, he was at the airport

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
to stop his wife from leaving the country
with their kid. He didn't make it.

122
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,216
Add that to watching Escobar
build a five-star prison

123
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,093
and then walking out the back door.

124
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,640
We both deserve to see this through...

125
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,143
boss.

126
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,532
Have you, uh... had anything to eat
in the last 24 hours?

127
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:25,161
This new boss... Messina...

128
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,246
what do you know about her?

129
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,708
Only what I've heard.
She's out of New York.

130
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,962
Doesn't put up with any shit.

131
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,132
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

132
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,341
Am I out?

133
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,386
I don't know.

134
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:48,517
Well, I ain't ready to go home yet, Javi.
I'll tell ya that.

135
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,518
Damn it! She's fucking...

136
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:57,026
Take a shower. Sober up.

137
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,319
Talk to you.

138
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,411
Look behind you. Watch out for that guy.

139
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,498
That's it.

140
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,833
Smash the telephone booth.

141
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,252
Get the pipe.

142
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,213
I already know, Dad.

143
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,131
You have to get it.

144
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,676
And what's that, a woman?

145
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,845
I'm about to fight a woman or what?

146
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,098
- Her name's Nora.
- Oh, yeah, what's her name?

147
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,642
Nora.

148
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,728
Boss, excuse the interruption.
One moment, please.

149
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,147
How do you...?

150
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,574
What about the laboratories?

151
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,411
It's been difficult
to find the Moncada laboratories, boss.

152
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,373
And the ones that we find,
we can't get inside.

153
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,417
There are police checkpoints everywhere.

154
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,379
We lost four men
trying to get through one.

155
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,715
Sons of bitches.

156
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,135
And what about Judy Moncada?

157
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,432
We can't find her anywhere. Or Don Berna.

158
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,934
Find her.

159
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,103
Yes, sir.

160
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,525
And you, boys?

161
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,653
- Everything is good, boss.
- All good, boss.

162
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,030
- How are you, Limón?
- Very good, sir.

163
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,907
- How are you feeling?
- Very good, boss.

164
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,742
- Comfortable?
- Thank you. Very good.

165
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,827
Good.

166
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,205
I'm going to teach you something.

167
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,210
There is nothing lower than a rat.

168
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:46,051
And if we let the rats run free,
the streets will be filled with them.

169
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,095
- Understand me?
- Yes, boss.

170
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,057
Give me one second. One second.

171
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,976
Boss, excuse me. It's Fernando.

172
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:59,607
- Tell me, Fernando.
- Your interview clearly worked, Don Pablo.

173
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,192
Palace wants to meet with me right away.

174
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,945
You heard that, brother? Hm?

175
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,200
- We have to finish our little job.
- But we already finished it, right?

176
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,495
No, brother, there's still one left.

177
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,831
But you already killed all the whores.

178
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,417
I'm not talking about whores, brother.

179
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,837
Why her?

180
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,215
- She did everything we told her to.
- Someone talked to the police.

181
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,760
Yeah, it was those fucking whores.

182
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,180
She is someone I can trust, man.

183
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,600
You can trust her, but I can't.

184
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,060
Move it.

185
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,897
Quica.

186
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,445
I'm not going to tell you again, brother.
And we've got some shit we gotta do first.

187
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,489
- Good day.
- Good day.

188
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:52,117
I have a meeting with the president.

189
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,744
I am Fernando Duque.

190
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,251
Your meeting is not
with the president, Mr. Duque.

191
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,544
How's that?

192
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,967
- With the vice minister, then?
- No, sir.

193
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,637
The information I have here says
your meeting is with the attorney general.

194
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,141
My apologies, Mr. Duque.

195
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,188
Now, Gaviria had made it clear

196
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,400
that the government
was not to negotiate with Escobar.

197
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,902
But Colombia Attorney General
Gustavo de Greiff

198
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,613
didn't give a shit
what the president wanted.

199
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,786
Unlike the US, where the attorney general
is appointed by the president,

200
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,790
in Colombia, the Supreme Court
chooses the attorney general,

201
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,292
whether the president likes it or not.

202
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:48,507
And in the case of Gustavo de Greiff,
you bet your ass Gaviria didn't.

203
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,135
Mr. Duque...

204
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:56,682
I believe the whole world
has the right to a fair trial.

205
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:03,147
Pablo Escobar has the same rights
as any other Colombian.

206
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:09,236
If he has committed a crime,
he must be judged and indicted.

207
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,322
He can't be hunted and killed
like an animal.

208
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,701
Mr. De Greiff,

209
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:21,790
everything you're telling me I find...
fascinating.

210
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,878
However, I don't...

211
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:30,174
I don't buckle under the pressure
of the Americans...

212
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,136
like Gaviria, Mr. Duque.

213
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,221
Uh-huh.

214
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,557
Then that means that...

215
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:44,021
you would consider...
making a deal with Pablo.

216
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,941
I am saying that Colombia...

217
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,528
has been at war far too long.

218
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,572
Of course.

219
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,956
The Americans are bringing in new people.

220
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:07,586
Different faces but, ultimately,
with the same motivation.

221
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,716
They are using us
to advance their political agenda.

222
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,760
Perhaps.

223
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:19,181
But the reality is we have to accept help
wherever it comes from.

224
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,352
And right now,
the gringos are very limited,

225
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,521
confined to Carlos Holguín
and the embassy.

226
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:30,317
On the other hand, Pablo Escobar
is gaining ground, gathering more support.

227
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,569
Everyone is helping him in Medellín.

228
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,281
- A long manhunt plays into his hands.
- Let's talk about Medellín.

229
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,499
Colonel Pinzón basically
has Escobar surrounded.

230
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,711
Do you think we'll succeed?

231
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,595
Listen, thanks for talking
to Messina, man.

232
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,765
I mean it. You saved my ass.

233
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,105
One more fuck-up, Murphy...

234
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,440
Oh, I know.

235
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,485
Is it gonna happen again?

236
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,406
I don't know.

237
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:23,162
DEA politics weren't
the only thing we had to navigate.

238
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,873
The Pinzón plan was in full effect.

239
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,918
He was doubling down on police presence.

240
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,299
Medellín was under martial law
and the base of Carlos Holguín

241
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,050
would look like Fort Apache.

242
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:42,097
Me and Javi were officially guests
of the CNP.

243
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,308
With all the comforts and amenities

244
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:48,187
that a guest of the National
Colombian Police could expect.

245
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,105
Which was zero.

246
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,483
And we weren't alone.

247
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:00,115
The DEA, CIA, Centra Spike and the army,
all under one roof.

248
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,912
It was one-stop shopping
for all things Pablo Escobar.

249
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:14,379
After Gaviria announced a new
$1.4 million reward for Pablo's capture,

250
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,549
Colonel Pinzón activated a new tip line.

251
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:21,762
And apparently he thought Javi and I
were just the guys to oversee it.

252
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,932
Forget about the fact
that my Spanish was for shit.

253
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,727
He was sidelining us and there was nothing
we could do about it.

254
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,315
Pablo would even have his men call in
just to fuck with us.

255
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,920
Tip line. What do you want to report?

256
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,617
I'm not sure what we expected.

257
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,161
To many people, Escobar was a hero.

258
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,540
It was like asking Chicago
to rat out Michael Jordan.

259
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:55,170
And those that didn't worship Escobar,
they were simply too scared to call.

260
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,964
But we had a system anyways.

261
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,050
One tip in a particular location
didn't mean shit.

262
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,513
A second call with the same information
still might not be worth acting on.

263
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,557
But three calls on the same location
from three different sources?

264
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,226
- Agent Peña?
- Yeah.

265
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,647
Now, that had to be checked out.

266
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,454
Hey, I said it was a system.

267
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,957
I didn't say it worked.

268
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,418
Fuck me.

269
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,337
Pansies!

270
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,050
Our inability to catch Escobar
was frustrating.

271
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,512
But back in Bogotá,
it was becoming a real liability.

272
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,061
Attorney General De Greiff.

273
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,690
They told me that you met
with Mr. Fernando Duque.

274
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,483
That's right.

275
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,236
The president was very clear

276
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,407
when he said that no one
was to communicate with Escobar's people.

277
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,703
Unfortunately for the president,
I don't work for him.

278
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,749
I work for the people of Colombia.

279
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:18,170
And, just like the president,
I also work for the people of Colombia.

280
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,423
And we are all working together,
in a united front, against Escobar.

281
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,468
- This isn't a single war...
- Are you afraid of what I might find

282
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,262
if I speak with him, Mr. Sandoval?

283
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,599
- Excuse me?
- Tell me something.

284
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,102
Why did you need to be there
that night at La Catedral?

285
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:39,441
Why was the presence of
the vice minister of justice necessary

286
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,859
to transfer a prisoner?

287
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,955
Because we're not talking about
any prisoner, Attorney General.

288
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,285
We're talking about Pablo Escobar.

289
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,163
And I was only following the orders
of the president.

290
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,290
I don't think that's true.

291
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,253
Are you insinuating something,
Attorney General?

292
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:04,925
- Are you accusing me of something?
- No, I'm not accusing you of anything.

293
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,135
At least, not yet.

294
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,558
But I'm going to open up an investigation
about the allegations...

295
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,606
that, possibly,
you helped Pablo Escobar escape.

296
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,652
You know what, Attorney General?

297
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,071
Eat shit.

298
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,558
- What the hell are we doing here?
- Running an errand, brother.

299
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,919
- What errand?
- For Don Pablo, brother.

300
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,964
Hello, hello.

301
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,299
Hello, gentlemen,
can I help you with something?

302
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:50,512
Of course, brother, I'm here to pick up
a package, under the name Alvarez.

303
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,722
Ah, yes, sir. Right away, with pleasure.

304
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,099
Go ahead.

305
00:23:55,767 --> 00:24:00,313
Brother... let's give up on the girl.
She's not coming back. Hm?

306
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,358
Are you afraid or what, Limón? Huh?

307
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,489
Close your fucking mouth
and do what I say.

308
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,129
Mr. Alvarez.

309
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,130
Quica!

310
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,758
This is the best toilet they make.
You really know your shit.

311
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,010
Brother!

312
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,637
That's what I'm talking about, brother.

313
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,097
Good.

314
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:38,018
Boys, put it in the car.
We've got some business to take care of.

315
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:43,607
I am going to take out her eyes
and make her eat them, that rat bitch.

316
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:55,243
- What number?
- Room three. I already told you.

317
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,862
Son of a bitch. You told me
that she was going to be here.

318
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:16,181
I don't know, brother.
I think this is where she lives.

319
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,562
She's not there.
Anyway, tomorrow is better.

320
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,980
We'll come back later.

321
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,192
Fuck that, brother.

322
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,072
Quica!

323
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,916
Over there, brother.

324
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,642
I got something, brother.

325
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:17,075
That bitch. I'm going to rip out her
tongue and shove it up her ass, brother.

326
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,663
I told you she wasn't here.
At this hour, she's already working.

327
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,082
- This is bullshit, brother.
- She's not here.

328
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,042
We'll come back later, then.

329
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,424
If the president
doesn't agree with the deal,

330
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,010
then we haven't won anything. Right?

331
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:41,641
Pablo, we have found a very good option.

332
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,143
Definitely.

333
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,272
If you allow me to negotiate
with De Greiff

334
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,400
- and create some dissension in the ranks...
- Oh, Fernando.

335
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,736
That's not why I pay you, Fernando.

336
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,948
You pay me to strategize
and that's exactly what I am doing.

337
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,618
Pablo, you have to understand...

338
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:06,333
The moment... The position
that Gaviria is in right now...

339
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:12,047
What happened at La Catedral
was a humiliating failure for him.

340
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:17,677
Right now, he's thinking
that capturing you is his only option.

341
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,222
And he's not thinking about

342
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:27,020
trying to find some way
to speak with us, but...

343
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,777
De Greiff, he is willing to speak.

344
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,864
And he has the autonomy to make deals.

345
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,456
Fine, okay.

346
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,708
Let's try it.

347
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,838
You're not going to believe it,
but the attorney general

348
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,049
supports the legalization of drugs.

349
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,301
- Don't bullshit me.
- It's true.

350
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:05,100
Trust me, Pablo, little by little,
with patience, with time...

351
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,394
What we don't have is time, Fernando.

352
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,733
Fernando, excuse us.

353
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,652
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

354
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,070
- Blackie.
- Yes, sir.

355
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,906
Thank you very much, Fernando.

356
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,826
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

357
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,077
Excuse me.

358
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,798
What's wrong?

359
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,136
We can't live like this, Pablo.

360
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:45,056
Running from one place to another, hiding,

361
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,933
hoping the government wants to negotiate.

362
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,144
Gaviria is going to negotiate, Tata.

363
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,524
He's too intelligent and too weak not to.

364
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,154
How are you so calm, huh?

365
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:05,744
Pablo, if Gaviria doesn't want you in jail
then we know perfectly well what he wants.

366
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,752
I think it's time for us
to leave Colombia.

367
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,882
I know we agreed we would never leave,
but things have changed.

368
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,842
No, nothing has changed.

369
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:34,397
My love, we have everything we need.

370
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,400
Let's get the children
and go to some other place.

371
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,820
A place where we don't have to hide.

372
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,909
We're not going to
spend our lives in hiding.

373
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,583
I promise you that.

374
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,852
Get ready
to get your balls snipped.

375
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:20,235
So... your wife left.

376
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,739
You're upset,
knocked a few back to numb the pain

377
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,451
and then decide to take it out
on some Wall Street scumbag.

378
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,621
Yeah, something like that.

379
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,375
Isolated incident?

380
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,752
Yeah.

381
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:44,133
Look, I know I've been in Colombia
for all of about 20 seconds.

382
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,635
Mm.

383
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,850
Before that, you and Peña had
complete autonomy to call your own shots.

384
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,311
It's gonna take you a minute
to get used to the new order.

385
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,522
You don't trust me yet? That's fine.

386
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:01,276
But if I'm gonna have your back,
I need to know that I can trust you.

387
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,612
Otherwise, I have no problem
sending you back to your wife in Miami.

388
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,699
Am I making myself clear?

389
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,576
Loud and clear.

390
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,743
Excellent.

391
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,830
You're dismissed.

392
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,686
Ortiz, don't let him
out of your sight. Over.

393
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,189
They saw La Quica buying a toilet.

394
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,943
I got "La Quica" and "toilet."

395
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,112
Not just any toilet.

396
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:49,365
The same one that Pablo had
at La Catedral. A Kohler.

397
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,826
All right, well, now, that I got.

398
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,371
We can't take that to Pinzón.
He'll laugh us out of the office.

399
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,165
We need more.

400
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,460
- But what else, Peña?
- Where did they see him?

401
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,754
Going toward the hills on San Isidro Road.

402
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,133
Maybe we can
get Centra Spike to do a flyover,

403
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,509
see what they come up with.

404
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,762
Be a lot better than the fucking tip line.

405
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,222
I'll be right back.

406
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,520
- A toilet?
- It's a long story.

407
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,523
- Give me the CliffsNotes.
- Look, just do me a favor

408
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,652
and ask them to sweep over
that specific area.

409
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:29,322
We're looking for any chatter
from Escobar's sicarios. Anything at all.

410
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,034
You recognize a voice, you come get me.

411
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:37,914
Duvall 1-4-4-3-6,
we heard some chatter at 1600 megahertz.

412
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:38,873
Be advised.

413
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,833
Baby, when are you coming?

414
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,377
You left me all alone.

415
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,921
I can't right now. It's too dangerous.

416
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,090
But you said you were coming.

417
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:51,260
Let things calm down
a little bit. I'll show you a good time.

418
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,181
That is definitely Velasco.
No ID on the girl.

419
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,850
What's the deal with the other call?

420
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,273
The quality's too poor
for voice recognition.

421
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,657
All right...
these were taken about two hours ago.

422
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,244
What's here is fincas, fincas.

423
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,747
Everything else is just smaller houses
here, here and here, and the outskirts.

424
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,001
You can probably eliminate
the smaller ones, not Escobar's style.

425
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,588
Which of the fincas have road access
both east and west?

426
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,008
This one here.

427
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,802
It's rough terrain down the back
of the mountain, but it's drivable.

428
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,053
It's gotta be the one.

429
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,597
We'd have a good chance
if we came at him from both sides.

430
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,765
This is good.

431
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,600
Great. What about Pinzón?

432
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,812
We're gonna need vehicles,
we're gonna need men.

433
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,773
Leave Pinzón to me.

434
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,028
Correct me if I'm wrong...

435
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:55,408
In the last raid,
your two men managed to capture

436
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:59,787
the president of the United States,
George Bush.

437
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,834
That was based on
many different calls from the tip line.

438
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:09,338
This is the voice of Velasco.

439
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:13,634
Ms. Messina, apparently
you think my men work for you.

440
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,055
You are mistaken. I don't work for you.

441
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,516
I decide how we are going
to work together. Is that clear?

442
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,021
And I already know what happened
to the last man that worked with you,

443
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,065
Colonel Carrillo.

444
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,941
He was exiled to Spain.

445
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,531
What did he say?

446
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,950
He said no.

447
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:45,708
Oh, she's not gonna last.
She gives up pretty fuckin' easy.

448
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,420
But Messina didn't give up easy.

449
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,797
She called Crosby...

450
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,300
Crosby called Gaviria...

451
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,469
and in less than 15 minutes...

452
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,514
- I understand.
- ...Pinzón was gettin' a kick in the ass.

453
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,934
Colonel, General Silva is on the phone.

454
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,268
Excuse me, Colonel.

455
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,067
I guess everybody works for somebody.

456
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,737
General?

457
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,241
Just because we could make Pinzón dance

458
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,368
didn't mean we could call the tune.

459
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,124
We would've gone in stealth.
Surround the fucker, then grab him.

460
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:30,211
Pinzón didn't do shit that way.
He liked kicking down the front door,

461
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,004
waking up the whole damn neighborhood.

462
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,092
Move your asses! The police are coming!

463
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:39,887
Get the cars and the money ready
right now. They're close, now!

464
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,514
Boss!

465
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,017
Boss, forgive me, it's urgent.

466
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,103
Boss.

467
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,481
It's the police.

468
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,526
They're coming up the hill.
We have to leave right now, boss.

469
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,073
Pablo. Pablo!

470
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,288
Sons of bitches.

471
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,498
They're coming from
the other side too, sir.

472
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,667
- What happened?
- We have to leave right now.

473
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,127
The police are coming.

474
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,337
- Get the cars ready.
- Yes, boss.

475
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,131
- Wait out back.
- Yes, boss.

476
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,299
Pablo!

477
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,926
Go get the kids.
We have to leave right now.

478
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:35,109
Come this way. Hurry up!

479
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,033
Hurry. Over here, through the tunnel.

480
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,460
Surround the house! Let's go!

481
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,583
They're gone, sir.

482
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,631
Colonel, nobody's in the house,
no signs of life, sir.

483
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,260
Shit.

484
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,804
At ease.

485
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,393
Don't forget
that Pablo made a career

486
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,103
of staying ahead of the cops.

487
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:57,149
A lot of the fincas he used
had tunnels built just for this purpose.

488
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,110
Even though he didn't like using them.

489
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,990
I guess you could say that
he was paranoid, but then again,

490
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:09,287
if people are actually after you,
that's not paranoid. That's just smart.

491
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,331
Peña! Messina!

492
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,188
He was here.

493
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,240
Go ahead, come in.

494
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,371
The bedrooms...

495
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,167
they're on the right.

496
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,974
Everything is okay, Tata.

497
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,436
No, Pablo.
This time everything is not okay.

498
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,939
Sweetheart, if Pablo
says everything is okay,

499
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,183
- it's because everything is...
- Was I talking to you?

500
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,654
I'm talking to my husband.

501
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,867
That was very close, Pablo.

502
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,869
And tomorrow, what?

503
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,288
Do you want your children
to watch those men kill you?

504
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,415
No one is going to die, Tata.

505
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,627
I am dealing with it.

506
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,921
How, Pablo?

507
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,090
Tell me how.

508
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,301
Negotiating?

509
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,763
Yesterday, they nearly killed you
for negotiating.

510
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,226
If you are going to fix everything,
fix it for good.

511
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,281
Don't worry.

512
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,839
You know,
in all the years I chased Escobar,

513
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,050
I could count on one hand
the times we almost had him.

514
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,344
And each time, we forgot
the two most important things

515
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,221
we already knew about him:

516
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,098
Close doesn't count.

517
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:38,227
And Pablo is never more dangerous
than when you almost have him.

518
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:09,633
With all the cops on the street,
it was easy to forget...

519
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,679
this was still Escobar's town.

520
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:21,312
He tolerated it all
in the interest of negotiations.

521
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,357
Chasing a man and his family
out of their home

522
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,193
in the middle of the night?

523
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,320
That wasn't a negotiation.

524
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,403
To Escobar...

525
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,324
well, that was an act of war.

526
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,407
Ready.

527
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,706
Boss, everybody is ready.
What's the order?

528
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,750
Do it.

529
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,877
Yes, sir.

530
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,965
- Huh? What's up?
- Ready.

531
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,467
- All right.
- Okay.

532
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,180
We're ready, sir.

533
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,210
Come.

534
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,954
Step on it!

535
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,424
Do it, brother.

536
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,719
It's cold, you fucking fag!

537
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,306
Kill him! Do it, bitch! Kill him!

538
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,599
Aah!

539
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,467
Peña!
