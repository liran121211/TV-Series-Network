00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,983
[in Spanish]
Good morning.

3
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,860
Good morning, Mom.

4
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,156
- Your cat bit me again.
- You stole my pencils.

5
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,783
- Why are you fighting?
- Because he stole my pencils!

6
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,347
- She's making it up.
- Stop fighting.

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,164
- Let's see.
- Let's go, sweetie. What time is it?

8
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,041
- 6:40 a.m.
- God, I'm late again.

9
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,961
Remember to ask your brother
what we talked about.

10
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,132
- Tell him school starts next week.
- Yes. I'll ask him, all right?

11
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,093
I still have to buy the books, everything.

12
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,512
I told you I'll ask him, my love,
all right?

13
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:59,350
And you still haven't tied your shoes.
So, like I taught you, right?

14
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,854
We have the rabbit ear,
we go around the tree, and...?

15
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,272
And it goes in the hole.

16
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,191
[explosion thunders in distance]

17
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,488
- [car alarms wailing]
- That was a loud one.

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,621
[Steve] You threaten a man's family,
and you find out what he's made of.

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,751
Pablo Escobar was made of rage,
revenge and terror.

20
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,465
Unable to lash out directly
at his enemies in Cali,

21
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,343
he went after their prized
legitimate business,

22
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:37,847
one they couldn't hide:
their beloved chain of drugstores.

23
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:43,394
And he blew them to shit along with anyone
unlucky enough to be standing nearby.

24
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,064
We're talking dozens of bombs.

25
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:51,444
He put the city of Bogotá on edge
and the Colombian government on notice.

26
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:56,616
Continue to ignore Los Pepes, refuse to
acknowledge their crimes, and you're next.

27
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,160
LUIS LONDOÑO WHITE, KIDNAPPER OF THOSE
SERVING PABLO ESCOBAR

28
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,912
But terror brings more terror,

29
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,624
and Los Pepes responded
with their own special brand.

30
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,918
We came up with a name for their displays.

31
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,796
- [in Spanish] Sit him there.
- [Steve] Colombian folk art.

32
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,131
[in Spanish]
Over here.

33
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,134
[Steve]
Like I said, you can't make this shit up.

34
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,681
The point of all this?
Psychopaths sending a message...

35
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,849
[laughing]

36
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,892
No matter how far you go...

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,436
[in Spanish]
Look at that ugly son of a bitch.

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,647
...we'll take it one step further.

39
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,734
The gates of hell were officially opened.

40
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,863
One... two... and three.

41
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,533
And everyone was scrambling
to get out of the fire.

42
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,702
Or climb into it.

43
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,372
[Latin guitar theme music plays]

44
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,962
[Hermilda in Spanish] This family
is the only thing I care about.

45
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,215
- You're the one that...
- [Tata] Me? Me, ma'am? Me?

46
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,885
[Hermilda] We shouldn't leave, Tata.
[Tata] All of this is your fault.

47
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,846
If you'd listened to Pablo,
my brother would still be alive.

48
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,727
[Hermilda] Because you do that so well?
Do you listen to him?

49
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:35,775
When you're always criticizing him,
doubting him, worrying.

50
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,945
[whispers] Tata.

51
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,033
[door closes]

52
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,371
[Hermilda]
I would never put this family in danger.

53
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,040
Tell her, Pablo.

54
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,252
Tell her it's not my fault, Pablo.

55
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,840
- [whispers] I know, Mom.
- This isn't my fault. Tell her, Pablo.

56
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:03,469
It's not your fault. I know.
It's not your fault.

57
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,306
[sobbing]

58
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,433
Everything's all right, Mom.

59
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,352
It wasn't your fault.

60
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,647
[takes deep breath]

61
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,350

- [flies buzzing]
- [Judy] Look at these smiling faces.

64
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,008
We didn't want to make you
uncomfortable, Judy.

65
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:29,097
How considerate of you.
So that's why no one called me?

66
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,351
Because this lab belongs to the Moncadas.
Mmm?

67
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,730
So I was supposed to be notified
when it was taken back.

68
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,943
- That wasn't made clear to us.
- I'm making it clear now, Carlos.

69
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,864
- What are we going to do with that?
- All the cocaine is going to Cali.

70
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,117
That is my cocaine.

71
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:54,705
Look, Judy, we decided that not a single
kilo of cocaine will be moved in Medellín

72
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,583
until Pablo Escobar is dead.

73
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,045
That's our strategy. To asphyxiate him.

74
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,007
That's the Cali cartel's strategy?

75
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,635
To keep making money
while the rest of us go hungry?

76
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:12,473
- You know we can't trust them.
- No. Not them or any of you.

77
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,353
We don't trust any drug trafficker.

78
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:24,735
Well, let's not get personal, Carlos.
All right?

79
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,155
We all need friends.

- [in Spanish] We're done working together.
- What's bothering you?

93
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,225
The killing of innocent civilians,
for starters.

94
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,354
Whether they're innocent or guilty,
I don't decide.

95
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,189
That's what priests are for, no?

96
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,158
The Castaños are crazier than ever,
and that wasn't part of the plan.

97
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,245
But it's working.

98
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,623
Not if I stop providing you intel.

99
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,379
For what it's worth, I am on your side.

100
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,339
I don't like what's happening.

101
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,883
Medellín is my home
and I love it very much.

102
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,096
As far as the methods
of the Castaños go...

103
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:03,769
well, those are the methods
that have Pablo's people hiding like rats.

104
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,565
Including that gonorrhea of a lawyer,
Fernando Duque.

105
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:12,194
Our guys fired a whole fucking clip
at him, point blank.

106
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,490
Can you believe that these sons of bitches
didn't hit him once?

107
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,118
I need you to help me find him.

108
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,665
He's Pablo's mouthpiece
and his connection to the government.

109
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,669
What we want is to exterminate this rat.

110
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:34,508
That way, we'll get to Pablo
and we can end this madness, Peña.

I've told you! You have to... [stammers]

What are you doing?
You have to bring the passports.

Juliana... they're trying to kill me.
We have to get out of here.

115
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,037
I think you're the one
who needs to leave.

116
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,874

Can I see Simon, at least?

117
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,710
- Where... Simon!
- Stop, Fernando!

118
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,712
Simon is at school.

119

Besides, this isn't even your week.
So, please... leave.

- Find this guy.

All right? You look tired.

[in Spanish]
Come in.

133
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,748
Go on, son. Sit down.

134
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,295
So, you're being reassigned...

135
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,216
and you will be moved into the intel unit
that was formed a couple of months ago.

136

You'll be all right there.

137
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,267
You're sending me to an office
because I made a mistake?

138
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,605
Anything else?

139
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,072
Yes, sir, Colonel.

And you?

- How long will we be there?
- Not long.

144
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,693
Just long enough for me
to get some things figured out here.

145
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,535
Do you remember when
we went to the United States?

146
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,914
It's going to be an adventure,
just like that.

147
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,624
Do they have Disney World there?

148
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,213
Mmm, I don't think so.

149
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:19,191
Listen to your mother
and your grandmother. All right?

150
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,781
I made more than one reservation so
no one would know what flight you're on.

151
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,618
I spoke to Fernando
and he said it's perfectly legal.

152
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,664
You have every right to leave the country.

153

but they'll never be able to destroy us.

00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,768
[in English] What we know is that Escobar
bought tickets for his family

172
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,272
on eight different outgoing flights
from Bogotá.

173
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,942
Destinations ranging
from Barcelona to Toronto.

174
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,528
Mr. President,
we need to prevent that from happening.

175
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,240
We need to keep the family in play.
If they're allowed to leave Colombia,

176
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,283
we're gonna lose leverage
in the hunt for Escobar.

177
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,746
Legally, there's no way we can stop them
from flying out of the country.

178
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,306
By applying pressure behind the scenes,

179
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,517
we can prevent the family
from being accepted upon arrival.

180
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:27,087
And if they're kept in Colombia,
he's gonna be worried about their safety.

181
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:33,302
He'll be more likely to make phone
contact, more likely to... make mistakes.

182
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,681
Because they're more likely
to become victims of Los Pepes.

183
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:47,691
Mr. President... if the family gets safe
haven, there's no telling what comes next.

184
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,904
Maybe Escobar surrenders,
maybe he goes to war.

185
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,784
The family is leverage. We have to use it.

186
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,794
I agree.

187
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,927
I want one of your people with them
giving us updates, running interference,

188
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,055
and have them find out
where they're going. And stick with them.

189
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,017
[retreating footsteps]

190
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,689
[phone rings]

191
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,488
- Murphy.
- Hey, it's Messina.

192
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,616
I need you to grab your passport
and head to Bogotá International.

193
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,534
Where?

194
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,954
The Escobars are trying to flee the
country. Wherever they go, follow them.

195
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,332
- Yeah. When?
- Now. Once you spot them, check in.

196
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,335
- And Murphy, keep this under wraps.
- Yes, ma'am.

197
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,838
Who was that?

198
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,214
Messina.

199
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,344
- Where you going?
- Going out.

200
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,472
- With your passport?
- Yep.

201
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,724
- Oh, that's all I get?
- Yep.

202
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,771
[indistinct chatter over PA]

203
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,572
- Uh, I'd like to get some tickets, please.
- For... which flight, sir?

204
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,657
Let's see. Madrid, London...

205
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,465
It's Murphy. Get me Messina.

206
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,094
- Messina.
- Hey, it's me. It's the Frankfurt flight.

207
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,888
Germany. Shit.

208
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,933
Yes, Mr. Foreign Minister, but I'm not
talking about some Turkish date farmer

209
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,729
looking to drive a taxi in Berlin.
I'm talking about Pablo Escobar's family.

210
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,606
[sighs]

211
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,651
No. No, they haven't committed any crimes.

212
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,946
[Steve]
Due to events in their fairly recent past,

213
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,658
Germany had some of the softest
immigration standards in Europe.

214
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,079
If you had a pulse,
they tended to let you in.

215
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,041
Now maybe that was good for mankind,

216
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,294
and it was certainly good
for the Escobars.

217
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,421
It was very bad for us.

218
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,548
[opera music plays on radio]

219
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,183
[in Spanish] Sergeant. Private
Hugo Martinez Jr. at your service, sir.

220
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,270
[clears throat]

221
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,816
The colonel's son.

222
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,947
He said you have some
technical background.

223
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,534
I took a couple
of engineering classes, sir.

224
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,205
And I built a ham in my parents' house.

225
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,335
Great. What do you know about RDF?

226
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,298
The basic concept, sir.

227
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,134
The basic concept.

228
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,098
All right.

229
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,978
Get acquainted.
We go out tomorrow afternoon.

230
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,604
And don't worry.

231
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,733
Unlike Carlos Castaño,
this won't hit back.

232
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,876
What's going on?
I'm going to freeze to death out here.

233
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,479
[man]
That's Bogotá. What do you expect?

234
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:40,841
Hey! What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why are you not working?

235
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,176
Get to work.
I'm not paying you with candy.

236
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,929
- Okay, okay.
- [Blackie] Pass me the phone, boy.

237
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,641
Make some fucking bombs.
You need an invitation to start working?

238
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:54,604
- [men murmur indistinctly]
- Hurry, boy! You get to work too!

239
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,648
And don't smoke near the gunpowder.

240
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,733
[grumbles]

241
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,616
- [men chatter in Spanish]
- [Blackie dialing]

242
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,236
[line ringing]

243
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,074
Hey, boss.
I just came back from the airport.

244
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,953
Ms. Tata, the kids and your mother
are on the plane, boss.

245
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,621
Thank the Virgin Mary.

246
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,710
That's the most important thing.
They're flying now.

247
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,295
One more thing.

248
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,298
We hit those fucking drugstores
pretty hard.

249
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,009
You tell us. Should we come home or...

250
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,971
No. Stay put. We're not done yet.

251
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,432
- I may need you again.
- Mmm.

252
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,225
Copy that, boss.

253
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,560
Thank you, Blackie.

254
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,524
[low grunt]

255
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:51,203
Figure out... what...
what time it is in Germany.

256
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,206
On it, boss.

257
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,219
[Limón, voice distant]
Boss! Boss!

258
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,014
[indistinct chatter, echoing]

259
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,350
[Limón]
Boss!

260
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,446
[practicing German phrases]

261
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,551
[in English] Got a bump on your guy.
About an hour ago.

262
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:52,639
Credit card belonging to Fernando Duque.
Used twice, restaurants.

263
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,433
Here, here, a couple streets over.

264
00:23:56,393 --> 00:24:00,105
Check this out.
Ran him through the CNP database.

265
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,024
A complaint got filed this morning.
Your boy's wanted.

266
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,027
- For what?
- Kidnapping and car theft.

267
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,656
Filed by his ex-wife. It's a blue Volvo.

268
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:14,035
He's running. And he's taking his kid.

269
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,871
He's 14 years old. Fuck.

270
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,502
[line ringing]

271
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,672
[Javier]
Peña.

272
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,717
[in Spanish]
Any word on our friend?

273
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,385
Did you find him?

274
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,391
- Peña?
- Not yet.

275
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,703
[phone rings]

276
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,623
- Messina.
- [Javier in English] Hey, boss.

277
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:03,668
I think Fernando Duque's on the run.
He's got his kid with him.

278
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,671
If he's that scared, maybe he's willing
to drop privilege and cooperate.

279
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,548
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I...

280
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,135
I might have an idea where he's holed up.

281
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,305
If he comes through for us, you think
we can get him out of the country?

282
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,725
- If he'll cooperate, yes. Look into it.
- You got it.

283
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,435
- And Peña.
- Yeah.

284
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,062
How did all this come up?

285
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,442
My CI knows a girl he sees.
Kind of fell into my lap.

286
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:31,112
- Mmm-hmm. Get on it.
- Yeah, boss.

287
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,534
[Trujillo in Spanish]
What's up, Peña?

288
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,037
Are we getting a beer or what?

289
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,791
Another day, brother.

290
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,752
See you tomorrow.

291
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,920
[Trujillo] Okay.

292
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,095
[siren wails in distance]

293
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,097
[low TV chatter]

294
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,578
No, no, no. What are you doing, Simon?

295
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:05,063
Leave it where it is.
I'm listening to the news.

296
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,400
What are we doing here?

297
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,944
I told you. We're going on a trip.

298
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,488
And what's happening? Where's my mom?

299
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,993
Simon... calm down.
I already spoke to your mother.

300
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,412
You got yourself into trouble, didn't you?

301
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,999
It's because you work for Pablo Escobar.

302
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,128
That's why this is happening.

303
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,426
You're his lawyer.

304
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,139
What are we going to do now?

305
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,518
I have a plan. Calm down.

306
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:48,732
You don't have a plan, Dad.
You're a son of a bitch. A fucking thief.

307
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,153
[softly]
Did you say "son of a bitch"? "Thief"?

308
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,991
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer.

309
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:03,371
All of the money this family has,
we have because I've been a good lawyer.

310
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,541
- I do my job.
- I want to call my mom.

311
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,710
You want to call your mom?

312
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:12,213
Do you want to call your mom,
or do you want to behave like a man?

313
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,051
Are you going to be a pussy
and call your mom? That's a great idea.

314
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,637
Let's call her so she can tell you where
all the money for your toys came from.

315
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:23,433
Your room full of toys.
Where do you think it came from?

316
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,645
Hmm? You didn't complain
during the Christmases or the birthdays

317
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,981
or when I bought you a motorcycle.

318
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,651
But now you're complaining.
Very well. Very well. It's over.

319
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,490
It's over! Now that they're
going to kill me, it's over.

320
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,709
[Simon sniffles softly]

321
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,253
I'm sorry... Simon.

322
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,257
[whispers]
I didn't mean to say that.

323
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,550
Forgive me.

324
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,805
Everything will be all right.
Forgive me.

325
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,484
[air hissing]

326
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,156
Was it a heart attack or what?

327
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,699
[Ricardo]
You fainted, Pablo.

328
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,747
How many of those are you taking?

329
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,544
I've had a terrible headache.

330
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,422
- Those aren't any good, Pablo.
- [removes blood pressure cuff]

331
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,049
You shouldn't put so much shit
in your body.

332
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:45,598
You're better off... taking these drops.
They're homeopathic.

333
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,977
Three drops under your tongue
in the morning and two at night.

334
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,697
Have you ever been to Disney World?

335
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,241
I haven't.

336
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,162
It's beautiful.

337
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,208
It's very organized. Very clean.

338
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,339
What's wrong with me, Ricardo?

339
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,259
Stress.

340
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,886
[Pablo] Mmm.

341
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,512
Stress is dangerous.

342
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,098
How's the weed working out?

343
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,060
I haven't been smoking a lot.

344
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:37,650
The first man who smoked marijuana
was a Chinese emperor.

345
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,863
He burned the plant because
he was attracted to its smell.

346
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,533
But when he inhaled the smoke,
he saw a blue jay.

347
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,415
And the bird told him
to conquer his neighboring empires.

348
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,083
And that's what he did.

349
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,547
All right.

350
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,843
With you until death, Don Pablo.

351
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,304
Thank you.

352
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,601
I'd like to stay and stand guard.

353
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,983
All right. Thank you.

354
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:37,877
Let's see, darling.
Color inside the lines.

355
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,880
There it is.

356
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,651
[woman speaks in German over PA]

357
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,408
[woman in English]
Attention, ladies and gentlemen:

358
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,828
We will be passing around
immigration cards.

359
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,296
[low chatter]

360
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,631
[quietly in Spanish]
This is our stop.

361
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,589
Foreign ministry isn't cooperating.
We need more time.

362
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,682
Don't let them leave the airport.

363
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,728
- They do, it's over.
- Right, right, right. Talk to you soon.

364
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,908
Sir, I'm with the United States DEA.

365
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,636
There's passengers on this flight
who can't be allowed into this country.

366
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,748
Heard of Pablo Escobar? Cocaine? That's
his family. You can't allow them in.

367
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:00,668
Unless there is a problem with
their passports or any type of contraband,

368
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,878
they may enter Germany.

369
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,631
[murmuring indistinctly in Spanish]

370
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:08,468
What about if they're transporting
a large amount of foreign currency?

371
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,971
- [man] You would be certain of this how?
- I saw it. I saw it with my own eyes.

372
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,058
I work with the DEA, been with
this family, I've been tracking Escobar

373
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:18,061
for a long goddamn fucking time.
It is in that bag.

374
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,480
- [man] In which item of luggage?
- [Steve] The maroon bag.

375
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,565
- [man speaks in German]
- Perdón?

376
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,109
- [man in English] Do you speak English?
- No.

377
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,237
I'm a hundred percent certain.
That burgundy bag.

378
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,156
Fucking hell.

379
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,910
[speaks German]

380
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,705
- Hello. Pablo Escobar? Familia Escobar?
- Sí.

381
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,789
[speaks in German]

382
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,501
- [in English] You speak English? German?
- No.

383
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,835
[speaking German]

384
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,521
- [in Spanish] What's going on?
- What's happening?

385
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,838
[man in English]
Come with us.

386
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,275
- [in Spanish] What's going on?
- [Tata] Can you give me back my passport?

387
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,470
[Steve] To be honest, I'd never actually
seen any cash in the bag.

388
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,391
[in Spanish]
That money is ours.

389
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,352
[Steve] But I knew Pablo
would never let his wife go anywhere

390
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,854
without some serious walking around money.

391
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,525
- [Tata] Pablo, they're not letting us in.
- No, no! They can't do that.

392
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,277
- That's what they're doing.
- They can't...

393
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:12,532
Listen, Tata, that's illegal.
That's illegal. Don't worry.

394
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,866
Don't worry, because...

395
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,954
Do what you need to do to get us
into Germany. I have to hang up.

396
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,707
- [man speaks German]
- [in Spanish] Don't touch me!

397
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,110
- [in English] Please come now.
- [Tata in Spanish] Let go!

398
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,128
[grunts, hangs up]

399
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,731
[car alarm blaring]

400
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,754
[grunts, exhales]

401
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,174
- [door opens]
- No, no, no! No!

402
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,052
- Shh.
- [sharp breaths]

403
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,848
Fernando Duque.

404
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,391
Javier Peña.

405
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,271
[in Spanish]
It took me one day to find you.

406
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:29,108
If you don't want them to kill you,
you need to start doing things better.

407
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,823
[softly]
Please... get me out of here.

408
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,827
Please get me out of Colombia. Do you know
who I work for? Who I worked for?

409
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,580
Well, our help isn't free.

410
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,335
We need full cooperation.

411
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,879
[Simon] Dad!

412
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,257
Hey, Simon, it's all right.

413
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,178
It's all right. Uh, go back inside.
I'll come up soon.

414
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:04,936
It's my son. He's... He's scared.

415
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,856
First, we'll get you to Holguín.
You'll be safe...

416
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,610
No, no, no! No. No, no.
No, we're staying here.

417
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,864
There are cops working
for Los Pepes everywhere.

418
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:22,453
It would be better if you get us
to the United States at once.

419
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,333
I'll cooperate with you.
[stammers] Anything you want.

420
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,044
I'll cooperate with you.
Please get us out of Colombia.

421
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,421
Is that a deal?

422
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,759
[silent]

423
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,679
Do as I say.

424
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:44,225
Start by hiding your fucking wife's car.

425
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,402
[Steve] While the authorities were using
all the political pressure they could

426
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,863
to keep Escobar's family in play,

427
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,741
Pablo was practicing
his own special form of diplomacy.

428
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,826
[dialing phone]

429
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,370
- [ringing]
- First, he called the German embassy

430
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,580
in Bogotá.

431
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,292
[in Spanish]
Hello, German embassy.

432
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:14,797
First of all, I'll kill every last German
son of a bitch that lives in Colombia.

433
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:19,010
Then I will bomb Frankfurt, Munich...

434
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,096
[Steve] Then he threatened to bomb
a couple of Lufthansa planes.

435
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,018
[Pablo] I'm going to shove bombs
up your asses, you bastard motherfuckers.

436
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:31,898
Nazi, racist gonorrheas.
I'm going to kill all of you. You hear?

437
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,858
I'm going to kill all of you!

438
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:34,775
[dialing]

439
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,445
[Steve]
Then he dialed up President Gaviria.

440
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,488
Who couldn't take the call.

441
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,992
Because he was already on the phone
with the German ambassador.

442
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:51,834
And then, Pablo did something
he'd never done before in his life.

443
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,671
He called a cop and he asked for help.

444
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,800
Not just any cop,
but the top cop in the country:

445
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,928
Attorney General De Greiff.

446
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:08,059
I once heard you say that I had the same
rights as any other Colombian citizen.

447
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,772
I imagine that also applies to my family,
correct?

448
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:17,235
The government hasn't done anything
to stop Los Pepes,

449
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,989
those terrorists who have attacked
my family and murdered my associates.

450
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:27,286
Is that how the Colombian government
ensures the rights of all its citizens?

451
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:31,874
The president is trying to prevent
my family from entering Germany

452
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,501
and yet you do nothing about it.

453
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:38,965
That man wants to dangle my family before
Los Pepes and use my children as bait,

454
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,760
and you, who call yourself a man
of principle, do nothing about it.

455
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,641
[hangs up]

456
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,852
[chatter in Spanish]

457
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,655
- [static]
- There's a lot of interference.

458
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,367
Yes. Medellín has too many electrical
wires, phone wires, antennae.

459
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,453
- That must be why.
- What's your success rate?

460
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,873
[sighs] To be honest,
we haven't located a signal yet.

461
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,709
Not one?

462
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,794
Not one.

463
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,382
[sighs]

464
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,012
Here's what we're going to do, Morales.

465
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:31,767
Let's both start here: L9.329.

466
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,520
There it is.

467
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:48,576
I was talking to my police contact and
you won't guess who's hiding the lawyer.

468
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,581
None other than that son of a bitch, Peña.
What do you think about that?

469
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,834
Who's your contact?

470
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:01,672
Who he is isn't important.
The important thing is that I trust him.

471
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,884
And you know what
the worst part of this is?

472
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,053
We can no longer trust Peña.

473
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,014
Then we'll have to put a bullet in him.

474
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,267
No.

475
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,021
We can't kill DEA agents.

476
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,065
Oh, no? Why not?

477
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,737
If it were up to me,
I'd feed him to the crocodiles.

478
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,699
[Fidel]
Berna, look...

479
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:40,544
Schedule a meeting with Peña,
just as you have been.

480
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,381
We'll take care of the rest.

481
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,808
[siren wailing in distance]

482
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,949
[indistinct chatter]

483
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,166
[engine revving]

484
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,486
[in English]
Agent Peña.

485
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,613
[soft Latin music plays on radio]

486
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,950
I don't think Don Berna's
gonna make it tonight.

487
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,006
What is this?

488
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,716
Just a friendly chat.

489
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:15,181
You're making some very scary people
pretty nervous, Javier.

490
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,393
Which puts me in a spot because...

491
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,438
I'm the one who suggested
they approach you in the first place.

492
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:28,319
Now, I don't know what you know
about what it is I do,

493
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,321
but understand this:

494
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,866
I have our nation's
long-term interests in mind.

495
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,951
That's the beat I walk.

496
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,455
And sitting here tonight,
that means making sure the right folks

497
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,875
are left standing when Escobar
gets his bullet.

498
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,631
So do Uncle Sam a solid.

499
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,384
Don't complicate that.

500
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,021
These folks are prone
to emotional decision-making.

501
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:10,152
Which can lead to bush league nonsense
like... killing a federal agent.

502
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,823
By the way, they found the lawyer.

503
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,451
Even without your help, so...

504
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,058
[low TV chatter]

505
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,490
COURTESY OF LOS PEPES

506
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:45,497
[in Spanish] Córdoba recovers,
we'll have a goalie in place.

507
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:49,877
Leonel Álvarez can do his thing
and move the ball along. Ooh-wee!

508
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,755
[in English] Trujillo!
You follow me to the fucking hotel?

509
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,881
Huh?

510
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,385
[whispers in Spanish] Did you follow me
to the hotel? You told Berna?

511
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,888
Let go.

512
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,765
Tell me, asshole.

513
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,410
- Let go! It's all right.
- [man] What's the problem?

514
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,145
[Trujillo]
I'll catch up. Everything's fine.

515
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,231
What's going on, Peña?

516
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,319
Playing the fucking American?

517
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,198
[softly]
Did you see what they did to his son?

518
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,912
How many families has Pablo Escobar
destroyed, Peña? Do you know?

519
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,084
You don't decide who lives and who dies.

520
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:34,296
Don't be fucking stupid.
This is how we do it.

521
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:06,912
[De Greiff] I understand that you're
trying to prevent Escobar's family

522
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,122
from entering Germany.

523
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,957
Let's make something clear:

524
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,628
If you've come to plead for them
as part of some deal, the only...

525
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,463
No, Mr. President.

526
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:24,346
I haven't come to plead for them.
I've come to plead for you.

527
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,642
For me? How so?

528
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:32,896
I know that you want Escobar dead.

529
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,359
And while I don't agree with that,
I understand it.

530
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,614
But this... this I can't understand.

531
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,702
This isn't just wrong.

532
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:53,584
It puts you, the president of Colombia,
in league with a death squad.

533
00:45:55,002 --> 00:46:01,216
Call the German chancellor.
Tell him to let the family in.

534
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,191
[speaking in German]

535
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:24,531
[man in Spanish] I'm sorry to inform you,
your entry into Germany has been denied.

536
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,454
I know my rights, sir.
But you don't understand.

537
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,849
My children are in danger.
Send me any place other than Colombia.

538
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,708
[speaking in German]

539
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:40,130
[in Spanish] Tell him the children are
under age. We just want to live in peace.

540
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,507
We just want to live in...

541
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:47,304
No, no, no.
Tell him that's all we want to do.

542
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,556
To live in peace.

543
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,019
Get the children and your belongings.

544
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,187
Please.

545
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,487
[Hermilda] They kick us out of
the country, and they keep the money, too.

546
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,490
- [man speaks in German]
- [Hermilda in Spanish] I know. I'm going.

547
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,660
What is this?
Why are we being treated this way?

548
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,870
[Tata]
You can't treat us like criminals.

549
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,205
[man]
Let's go.

550
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,420
[clears throat]

551
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,558
[Tata in Spanish]
Pardon me.

552
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,811
I hope you enjoyed Germany.

553
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,324
[plane approaching]

554
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,871
[indistinct chatter over PA]

555
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,378
- [in Spanish] How much for this?
- Two thousand pesos.

556
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,048
Thank you.

557
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:32,260
[Tata and Hermilda speak softly]

558
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,378
[in Spanish]
Ladies.

559
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,590
[vehicles racing up]

560
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,802
- [tires screech]
- Stop! National police!

561
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,387
- DEA!
- Get on the ground!

562
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,097
[overlapping chatter in Spanish]

563
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,975
It's all right, ma'am, we're with
the national police. Come with us.

564
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,728
The attorney general asked us
to put you under protective custody.

565
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,648
Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Come with us. You'll be safe. Let's go.

566
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,694
- Come with us.
- Let's go. Quickly. Let's go!

567
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,072
[tires screeching]

568
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,466
[phone rings]

569
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,262
How can I help you, boss?

570
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,435
[Pablo] I want this faggot of a president
to know what happens

571
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:07,314
when you're on the side
of those bastards, Los Pepes.

572
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:13,612
I want to see blood.

573
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,658
I want the sky to burn with gunpowder.

574
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:23,705
I want you to put the biggest bomb
you can get your hands on

575
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:27,209
as close as you can to
the Presidential Palace. Are we clear?

576
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,712
[sighs]
As you wish, boss.

577
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:24,850
[engine stops]

578
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:52,252
- [street noise]
- [pedestrians chattering]

579
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,471
[father]
My love, let's go. Let's go.

580
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:11,146
Do you want one? Yes? How much?

581
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,480
[man]
One hundred pesos.

582
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,276
- Here.
- Thank you.

583
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,239
[mother] Are we going that way?
[father] That way, darling.

584
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:26,036
You better be a doctor when you grow up.
This is very expensive.

585
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,622
Elena! Elena, let's go!

586
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:38,423
[loud rumbling in distance]

587
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,884
[car alarms wailing outside]

588
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,222
[Steve]
220 pounds of C-4.

589
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,726
Same as a bomb on an F-16.

590
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,355
Dozens were killed.

591
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:58,234
Scores were injured,
many of them children.

592
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,905
Pablo never took credit for the bomb.

593
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,367
He didn't have to.

594
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,498
- [woman sobbing nearby]
- [siren wailing in distance]

595
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,175
Elena?

596
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,094
- [woman shouts nearby]
- [moaning]

597
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,181
Elena!

598
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,935
Elena!

599
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,395
[woman sobs nearby]

600
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,730
[man shouts in Spanish]
Lift him up carefully!

601
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,951
[father whimpers]
