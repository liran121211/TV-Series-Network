Listen, I am not missing my
flight for anything tomorrow.

188
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:24,369
Mmm?

189
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,496
No.

190
00:41:28,706 --> 00:41:30,375
You sure you can't stay?

191
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:36,130
I can't leave Olivia with
my sister forever, Steve.

192
00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:39,968
- Anyway, you'll be in Medellín.
- Ah.

193
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:44,388
You know, I met the
new head of Search Bloc.

194
00:41:44,472 --> 00:41:46,307
- Yeah?
- He's an interesting guy.

195
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:49,644
I have a good feeling about him.

196
00:41:52,855 --> 00:41:55,775
Before I forget, I want you...

197
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:58,611
I want you to give this to Olivia.

198
00:42:02,198 --> 00:42:03,533
Meant to be good luck.

199
00:42:07,787 --> 00:42:09,247
You keep it then.

200
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:18,047

[in English] A fucking grid search?

204
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:07,930
Isn't that how they caught the
guy who shot Abraham Lincoln?

205
00:43:08,014 --> 00:43:11,601
- It's a change.
- Yeah, it's dated and conventional.

206
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:17,190
Well, we tried going
bullet for bullet with him,

207
00:43:17,273 --> 00:43:19,108
and you saw how that ended up.

208
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:22,278
Oh, so that's it?

209
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:25,531
A week ago you volunteered to
jump into a chopper with Carrillo

210
00:43:25,615 --> 00:43:27,033
and now it's a change?

211
00:43:29,702 --> 00:43:33,706
Don't worry about it, man. We'll all
feel better once Escobar's in the ground

212
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:37,126
- one way or another, right?
- There is no other way, Javi.

213
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:39,921
Search Bloc is the only game in town.

214

You really think this
asshole can get it done?

215
00:43:44,675 --> 00:43:46,927
I don't know. Maybe he'll surprise us.

216
00:43:49,347 --> 00:43:50,556
Okay.

217
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:53,559
