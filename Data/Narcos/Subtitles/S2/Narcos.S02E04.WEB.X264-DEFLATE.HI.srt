00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,379
[Pablo in Spanish]
Tata. Where is everyone?

00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,675
[gunshot]

00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,563
- [sniffing]
- Pablo.

10
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,320
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right. [sniffs]

11
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,863
I'm all right.

12
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,492
Go back to bed.

13
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,804

[Valeria in Spanish]
Do you know why they brought you there?

16
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,572
He said they were going to send a message
to other kids.

17
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,534
[Valeria]
Who is "he"? Do you remember his name?

18
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,287
Colonel Carrillo.

19
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,291
[Valeria]
I know this is difficult...

20
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,836
but tell me what happened
when they brought you there.

21
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,258
They killed my friend.

22
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,677
[Valeria] I'm very sorry...
[Eduardo] This is a farce.

23
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,180
- Escobar trained this kid very well.
- I'll speak with Carrillo.

24
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,808
Whether he did or didn't do it
is beside the point.

25
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,394
Colombia is tired of Escobar.

26
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,021
Besides, Valeria Velez?

27
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,440
My God, she has no credibility
in this country.

28
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,943
I need to know if Carrillo
killed that boy.

29
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:43,199
If we say that she's doing this
to discredit Carrillo, they'll believe us.

30
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,787
But if the press finds out
that you spoke to Carrillo about this...

31
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,706
They'll assume it's the truth.

32
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,791
Exactly.

33
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,759
- What do you propose?
- [sighs]

34
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,512
That we don't play Escobar's game.

35
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:08,016
And that we leave things as they are...
for the time being.

36
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,981
I think we're going to need
more than an interview.

37
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:19,110
- No, no, no. No violence.
- That's not what I mean. I suggest...

38
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,529
Now we need to have the people
on our side.

39
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:27,201
Yes, of course. It's just the president
has denied it ever happened,

40
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,204
and the American news
hasn't even picked up the story.

41
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,789
Of course.

42
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:36,753
If David were the son
of an important politician, but...

43
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:42,383
the men of always aren't interested
in the children of never.

44
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,303

- Right?

[Pablo breathes heavily]

46
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,102
Hmm.

47
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,189
Hmm.

48
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,819
I'm writing a letter to the editors
of the most important newspapers

49
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:06,407
to tell them how that boy came to me,
scared for his life.

50
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:11,120
The world has to know what sort of monster
that son of a bitch Carrillo is.

51
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,499
Don Pablo, that's excellent.

52
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,586
[Pablo]
Give me that pencil.

When Pablo Escobar starts believing

54
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,680
the pen's mightier than the sword...
you know you're getting to him.

55
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,856
Carrillo's attacks on Pablo's facilities
in Medellín were putting him

56
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,420
- under more and more pressure.
- [in Spanish] Burn everything.

57
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,530
- [Steve] The way Carrillo saw it...
- [gunshots]

58
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:50,284
...each sicario we took out
got us one step closer to Escobar.

Don't move! Felix, take this one.

60

it felt good emptying Pablo's pockets...

We don't know yet. We're working on it.

64

...they weren't all sold on the method.

65
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,395
Is it true?

66
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,149
- Not to my knowledge.
- Don't play word games with me.

67
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,235
If that kid's telling the truth,
Peña and Murphy were there.

68
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,654
They're the only Americans
that asshole trusts.

69
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,450
I find it hard to believe that Colonel
Carrillo would want American witnesses.

70
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,160
Exactly what he wants.

71
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,788
Guarantees they won't say shit if people
start asking questions. And guess what?

72
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,082
People are asking questions.

73
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,297
Look, if Carrillo wants
to walk out in the streets

74
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,925
and gun down every sicario in Medellín,
God bless him.

75
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:53,181
But our guys can't be there
when he does it. Understood?

76
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,808
Understood.

77
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,853
It's been quiet for about a week.
Nothing of significance.

78
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,607
But a phone we connected to Edgar Prisco
popped up three times last night.

79
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,568
All within Manrique,
the same three-block vicinity here.

80
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,446
They just can't fucking help themselves,
can they?

81
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,283
My men did a drive-by early this morning
and identified a potential location.

82
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,827
Right here. The pool hall.

where he wants us to take his half.

- [man] Quickly, inside.
- [Steve in Spanish] Friend.

119
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,473
[softly] Calm down, friend.

You need to get up here!

123
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,617
Murphy, get in the car.

124
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,789
The fuck were you thinking?

125
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,174
[whispers] This fucking close.

126
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,470
[Steve]
We were definitely getting closer.

127
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,431
And so who could blame
the "Gentlemen of Cali"

128
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:49,393
for starting to think about a future
without Pablo Escobar?

129
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,649
[in Spanish]
I can't believe it. You son of a bitch.

130
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,234
It's carbon rock.

131
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,905
The cocaine is dissolved and mixed in.

132
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:05,117
Did you think I bought chemistry labs
because I enjoyed the class in school?

133
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,953
[chuckles] You're going
to put chemists out of business.

134
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,081
I'm more interested
in putting Pablo out of business.

135
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,336
Now's the time to move in on Miami.

136
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,174
It won't be hard for us
to take that business.

137
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,221
- But don't you think it's too early?
- Pablo's in hiding.

138
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,141
The Search Bloc is killing his men.
Soon they'll catch him,

139
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,561
and I want us to be in an advantageous
position when that happens.

140
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,688
Could you take care of that?

141
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,316
Yes, of course.

142
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,612
But don't make it too obvious.

143
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:47,576
I don't want Judy Moncada asking fucking
questions and negotiating for a piece.

144
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,204
Then you should call Pablo

145
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:55,709
and tell him we'd be happy
to turn Judy over to him.

146
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,671
We'll dump her in the same ditch
we'll be dumping him in.

[Velasco] Guys.

149
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,569
The Search Bloc took another Moncada lab.

150
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,280
The sons of bitches killed
three of the Prisco brothers.

151
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,865
Ricardo got away.

152
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,783
- When was this?
- Last night.

153
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,746
It's that son of a bitch, Don Berna.
He's telling the cops everything.

154
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,416
[man] Let's hide out on the coast.
I'll convince Don Pablo.

155
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,419
Since when do we hide, brother? Huh?

156
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,839
Let's trust the boss.

157
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,342
Yes. Don Pablo always finds a solution.

158
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,389
[phone ringing]

159
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,977
- Hello? Who is this?
- Get me Don Pablo. Fernando Duque.

160
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,395
- Fernando.
- Get him now.

161
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,940
Yes, sir, right away. Limón, please.

162
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,074
[Limón] Boss?

163
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,911
Your lawyer, Mr. Duque.

164
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,167
- How many were published?
- [Fernando] Don Pablo,

165
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,879
we sent all of them to the newspapers.

166
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,760
How many of my letters were published,
Fernando?

167
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,220
Yes. Uh, none.

168
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,806
They're very, very well written.

169
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:39,271
It's not about how well written they were,
Fernando. It was the fucking truth!

170
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,404
[sighs]

171
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,414
[Steve] If it seemed like Escobar's world
was crashing down around him,

00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,541
it was actually about to get worse.

173
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,254
Remember when Pablo collaborated
with M-19 communists

174
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,548
during the Palace of Justice siege?

175
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,803
By doing that,
he pissed off the Autodefensas...

176
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,931
an extreme right-wing paramilitary group

177
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,767
that was in direct conflict
with the communist guerrillas.

178
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,105
[man in Spanish] This is why
we saw ourselves forced to take up arms

179
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,690
and defend ourselves...

180
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:26,193
[Steve] The leaders of the Autodefensas
were the Castaño brothers:

181
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,861
Fidel and Carlos.

182
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,364
Carlos is the one
barking orders at people.

183
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,534
In the late 70s, their father, Jesús,

184
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:37,079
a prominent landowner,
was kidnapped by the FARC guerrillas

185
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,290
who demanded 50 million pesos
for his ransom.

186
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,377
But his sons were
only able to come up with 16.

187
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,880
Well, that didn't cut it.

188
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,633
So the guerrillas
beat the elder Castaño to death.

189
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,388
From that day forward, the right-wing,

190
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,100
psychopathic, commie-killing
Castaño brothers

191
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,978
swore never to rest
until their father was avenged...

192
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,230
[man shouts in Spanish over loudspeaker]

193
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:07,651
...and every last guerrilla
driven from the countryside was killed.

194
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,072
[in Spanish]
Move it, you sons of bitches!

195
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:17,619
[Steve] Even innocent villagers
who simply lived in guerrilla strongholds

196
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,165
were put to death because
they lived under communist subjugation.

197
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,756
And in their efforts to wipe out
the communist guerrillas...

198
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,636
the Castaños caught the attention
of some like-minded friends.

199
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,682
- [in English] Mr. Stechner.
- Good to see you, my friend.

200
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,935
- Welcome. Have a nice trip?
- Thank you. As always, as always.

201
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,897
[in Spanish]
All right. Very good.

202
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,360
[chuckles, speaks English] These weapons
are better than the last ones.

203
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,278
They should be.

204
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,573
Thank you, Mr. Green,
for the continued support of your country.

205
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,285
I haven't used that name
since the School of the Americas.

206
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,456
I know you're waging a great war
against communism in these jungles.

207
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:06,085
We will not stop
until the last communist is dead.

208
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,795
[Bill]
Another struggle is emerging.

209
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:14,218
One that is essential to our, uh...
shared cause.

210
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,386
Escobar.

211
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,806
[Carlos]
Escobar deserves to die.

212
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:23,519
But our fight is here in the jungle,
against the guerrilla.

213
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,980
Yes, and Pablo's still strong in Medellín.

214
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,234
Yeah, strength is exceedingly relative.

215
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:41,578
An alliance is forming...
with the objective of taking out Escobar.

216
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,788
Who?

217
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,207
Rival elements from the trafficking world.

218
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,420
Look, what matters most is that
when Escobar's taken off the board,

219
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,466
the right parties are in a position
to make sure order is maintained.

220
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,262
And that strategic Colombian resources
and revenue streams...

221
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,265
don't fall into the wrong hands.

222
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,507
[up-tempo Latin music playing]

223
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,144
[in Spanish]
Guys.

224
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,813
Ms. Judy.

225
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:58,697
All right, now... I would like
to know the reason for this meeting.

226
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,534
- You don't see this every day.
- Look, Pacho, it's simple.

227
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,661
We need to get rid of Pablo Escobar.

228
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,917
We know you all joined forces against him.

229
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,921
And we want to know if it's possible
for my brother and I to join the cause.

230
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:18,592
Why? What do you want out of this?

231
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,720
- We want what's best for Colombia.
- That's it?

232
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,182
Pablo Escobar,
aside from being a terrorist,

233
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:30,646
is also allied with the guerrillas,
whom he has helped on many occasions.

234
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,775
Putting an end to Pablo Escobar
is a patriotic act.

235
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,820
[Carlos]
Imagine, Pacho, your financial resources

236
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:44,326
combined with all of the information
you have on Pablo Escobar's operation

237
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:49,206
- with our military experience...
- We'd make one hell of a death squad.

238
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:55,462
No, no, no, Mrs. Moncada. No.
A death squad? No. An army.

239
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,714
And when this army gets to Medellín,

240
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,676
Pablo Escobar's death
won't be a matter of months.

241
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,136
It'll be a matter of weeks.

242
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,681
What do you say, Pacho?

243
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,226
Can we count on the support
of you and your partners?

244
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,112
All of this sounds interesting.

245
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,156
With all due respect, gentlemen,

246
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,453
our organization already
has a strategy in place, and it's working.

247
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,248
It doesn't seem to me like it's working.

248
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,626
Because, to this day,
Pablo Escobar is still alive.

249
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,338
- That's right.
- At this rate, not for long.

250
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,014
Look, I'll share this conversation
with our partners.

251
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,851
But I think that, for now,
our answer is no.

252
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,105
Excuse me.

253
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,530
[rooster crows]

254
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,240
[mooing]

255
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,086
- Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.
- How did you find me?

256
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,047
I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.

257
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,468
- And La Quica?
- He's not here.

258
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,720
He's back there, looking for you.

259
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,518
If he finds out I'm here, he'll want
to kill me too. Let's talk. Relax.

260
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,523
Because of you,
I'll never be able to go back to Medellín.

261
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,941
- Maritza!
- Because of you,

262
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,111
- my daughter and I have to live in hiding.
- Relax, relax, relax!

263
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,950
I really am sorry,
and I'm here because I want to help you.

264
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,703
Like you helped the girls
you used to drive around in your taxi?

265
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,873
- I had nothing to do with that.
- And why would I believe you?

266
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,043
Because you know me,
and I wouldn't do something like that.

267
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,254
You killed me, Jhon.

268
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,341
You killed me by putting me
in your fucking taxi.

269
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:08,929
You knew how badly I needed that money
and you took advantage of that.

270
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,598
I really am sorry, Maritza.

271
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,684
Believe me, I think I have an idea
to get us both out of this.

272
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,769
What is it?

273
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,606
We'll give them what they want.
We'll give them Escobar.

274
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,275
[scoffs]

275
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,156
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Believe me, Maritza.

276
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:32,119
I'm the one who drives Escobar.
I know when his sicarios aren't with him.

277
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,955
- You can call the police.
- Maritza, what's going on here?

278
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,833
Mom, go back inside. Go inside.

279
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,796
Doña Liliana.

280
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,049
- I don't trust the police.
- Listen to me.

281
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,594
This is your chance
to get a visa from the Americans,

282
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,721
so you can leave with your daughter.

283
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:01,106
[sighs] And you?
What do you get out of this?

284
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:05,068
Working for Escobar isn't what it seems.
They're killing all of his men.

285
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,486
I'm afraid.

286
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,993
I need to get out.
We both need to get out, Maritza.

287
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:59,873
[Tata chuckles]
All right. My turn.

288
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,708
[Pablo] Mmm.

289
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,461
You both look beautiful.

290
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:14,054
All right, my love, go to your room
so I can talk with your dad, all right?

291
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,032
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

292
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,162
Velasco told me.

293
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,562
[Pablo sighs]

294
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,983
There are 20 men out there, Tata.

295
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:13,321
Yes, Pablo... 20 strangers.

296
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,741
Let's see.

297
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,786
How do you hold it?

298
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:37,387
What? Are you sure you want to laugh
at your wife while she's holding a gun?

299
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,309
- It's not a joke, Pablo.
- Tata.

300
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:46,062
Those 20 men out there
don't care what happens to us.

301
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,817
When the time comes,
it will just be you and me.

302
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,031
And I will be a part of this, Pablo.

303
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,125
All right.

304
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,964
But I think you need
more practice with that.

305
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,156
- [in Spanish] Javi, it's Gabriela.
- What's up?

306
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,742
- It's been a while and I want to see you.
- Now?

307
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,953
I can't right now. I'm working.

308
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,873
Don't be like that.

309
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:58,385
All right. Give me...
20 minutes, all right?

310
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:02,138
[in English] Get the lecture from Messina
about not leaving base?

311
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,223
Yeah.

312
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,684
Crosby must've really laid into her
on that one.

313
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,323
- Where you going?
- Out. Off base.

314
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,661
Okay, I guess it means "Fuck that."

315
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,246
[knocking at door]

316
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,498
[in Spanish]
Hello.

317
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,502
- I've got half an hour.
- Wait.

318
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:36,589
- Javi... Javi, Javi...
- Come here. What's wrong?

319
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,052
Hello.

320
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,096
Hi.

321
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,973
She's a friend of a friend.

322
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,268
Maritza, meet Javier.

323
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,438
And...

324
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,817
why are you introducing me
to a friend of a friend?

325
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,653
She's in trouble.

326
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,406
- Just hear her out.
- [sighs]

327
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,701
Goddammit, Gabby.
You could have told me over the phone, no?

328
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,828
- I knew you wouldn't come.
- Well, I'm leaving.

329
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,747
- Bye!
- No, no, no.

330
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,624
Wait. It's important.

331
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,002
Please.

332
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,421
Hear her out.

333
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,348
What's your name? Maritza?

334
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,441
What kind of trouble are you in?

335
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,486
Who are you in trouble with?

336
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,241
- La Quica.
- La Quica. You know La Quica?

337
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,331
- He wants to kill me.
- Well...

338
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,666
La Quica wants to kill a lot of people.

339
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,588
Why does he want to kill you?

340
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,592
Because I can tell you
where Pablo Escobar is.

341
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,727
And how are you going to do that?

342
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:17,106
I know exactly when and where
he'll be tomorrow.

343
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,698
[in English]
Her name is Maritza Rincón.

344
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,952
She works at the market across from
the brothel where the girls were killed.

345
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,329
Where we almost had La Quica
and the other guy...

346
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,041
Jhon Burgos. Goes by "Limón."

347
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:39,087
He used to drive the girls around until
La Quica made him Escobar's chauffeur.

348
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,049
This girl Maritza was actually
in the back seat serving as a cover

349
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,051
while Escobar was in the fucking trunk.

350
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,887
- And he knows her how?
- They grew up together here.

351
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,765
[Carrillo scoffs softly]

352
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,019
So this guy Limón,
there's no record of him.

353
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,939
There's no known connection
between him and Escobar,

354
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,983
yet somehow he ends up the driver.

355
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:03,278
Makes sense for La Quica to hire someone
the police didn't know about.

356
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,655
What does she want out of this?
A ticket to Disneyland?

357
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,199
She knows she doesn't get shit
if it doesn't pan out.

358
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:13,705
[in Spanish] If this is true, she can tell
us when Limón and Escobar go somewhere.

359
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,919
[in English]
You were there. You trust her?

360
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:23,922
Yeah.

361
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,467
Yeah, I do.

362
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,104
When we get the location, I want
Centra Spike up in the air to confirm.

363
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,355
[in Spanish]
Let's go.

364
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,236
- [in English] All right. This is good.
- Let's go.

365
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,744
[in Spanish]
Can you explain this?

366
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,874
A subpoena.

367
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:01,920
You're going to answer the questions
I have regarding La Catedral.

368
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,089
You mean your witch hunt.

369
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,844
Tell me, how did Pablo Escobar
get out of that prison

370
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:14,474
while being surrounded by 400 soldiers?

371
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,228
How many times do I have to tell you
that I don't know how Escobar escaped?

372
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,565
He must have paid someone off.

373
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,611
I would say that's
almost certainly the case.

374
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:34,243
This is about transparency, truth, law.

375
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:39,666
And I sense from your reluctance to speak

376
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:44,629
that the truth will not be kind to you
or our esteemed president.

377
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:52,679
Look, sir, what happened that night
was complicated and, yes,

378
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,391
I must confess that we lost control
of the situation, we made mistakes,

379
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,727
but we're talking about a national crisis.

380
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:06,275
So what? Does that mean
that we should just trust you?

381
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:12,115
[sighs] Look, sir... [clears throat]
I ask you to please trust me.

382
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,453
All you're doing by making
this investigation public

383
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:23,167
is destroying the life of a very good
human being. Our president.

384
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:28,214
Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

385
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,926
[resumes typing]

386
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,096
[phone rings]

387
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,563
Hello?

388
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,523
[softly] Hello, Maritza. It's me.

389
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,902
- I spoke with Peña.
- Pay attention.

390
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,449
In one hour, I will take Pablo
to his accountant.

391
00:33:55,867 --> 00:34:00,872
He lives in the south. I need you to give
the Americans the address. Understand?

392
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,168
Are we really going to turn in
Pablo Escobar?

393
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:10,757
Yes, Maritza.
We're going to do this together.

394
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,177
But I need you to trust me.

395
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,847
Give me the address.

396
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,724
Write it down.

397
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:25,063
9th street with 98-3. Got it?

398
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,859
Got it.

399
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:45,583
...my love. Do it again. [laughing]

400
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,045
I'm sorry, boss.
You'll be late to your appointment.

401
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,172
Thank you, Limón. A kiss.

402
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:55,593
Come on. Ice cream. Ice cream.
One, two, and... [grunts]

403
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,542
Everything all right, boss?

404
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,725
[phone rings]

405
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:26,808
Peña.

406
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:31,314
9th Street. 98-3.

407
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,566
Okay. Got it.

408
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:40,072
[in English] I need to know
if there's activity around this address.

409
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,533
You get a match on a voice,
you find me immediately.

410
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,118
Okay. You got it.

411
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,014
[distorted voices over recording]

412
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,443
- This was recorded about five minutes ago.
- You can barely hear it.

413
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,518
Let me clean it up.

414
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:17,652
[Pablo in Spanish] All right.
Now turn off the satellite phones.

415
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,445
- That's Pablo.
- We have to move now.

416
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,656
- Yeah.
- [Messina] You two are staying here.

417
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,658
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

418
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,535
Crosby finds out you went on another raid,
we all get a ticket home.

419
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,205
Crosby doesn't have to know shit.

420
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,623
It's not negotiable.

421
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,337
We'll be in radio contact.

422
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,174
Jesus.

423
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:54,188
[in Spanish] We'll be out in 20 minutes.
So be on alert.

424
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,606
Yes, Colonel.

425
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,943
[man]
Attention! We're headed out!

426
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,418
[indistinct chatter over radios]

427
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,307
[in Spanish]
We're on San Juan.

428
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,018
[in English]
Copy that. Watch your six, guys.

429
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,687
How's it looking out there?

430
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,358
[in Spanish] Everything's calm.
Murphy, you're buying the drinks tonight.

431
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,901
[chuckles]

432
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,236
[in English]
Cheap bastards.

433
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,032
Don't forget to pick me and Peña up
some cigars on the way.

434
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,284
[in Spanish]
Of course, blondie.

435
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,208
[indistinct shouting over radio]

436
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,716
Reverse!

437
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,260
[man shouts in Spanish] Look above!

438
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,430
It's an ambush!

439
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,350
[indistinct shouts]

440
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,727
Sabada!

441
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,230
[in Spanish] Carrillo, respond!
Carrillo! Trujillo! Do you copy?

442
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,107
[indistinct shouts]

443
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,567
[men yelling]

444
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,404
Son of a bitch!

445
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,115
[in English] Goddamn it, speak to me!
We need people there.

446
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,200
Carrillo!

447
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,203
[grunts]

448
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,421
[man yelling in Spanish]
Go, go, go! Come on!

449
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,968
Fuck!

450
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,048
[in Spanish]
Look at me.

451
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,012
Look at me.

452
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:48,195
You asked a child to give me this.

453
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,877
You can have it back.

454
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,426
And this...

455
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,930
is for my cousin, Gustavo.

456
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,601
[whispers] Coward.

457
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,186
Son of a bitch.

458
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,033
[sirens wailing in distance]

459
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,511
Don't worry. It's going to heal well.

460
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,350
[in English] I'll go back to Bogotá
with the body until the funeral.

461
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,020
They call his wife?

462
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,147
Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.

463
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,570
This ain't on you, Javi. It's on Escobar.

464
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,989
And one way or another, he pays.

465
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,785
We all do. Right?

466
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,514
[ambulance siren wailing]

467
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,361
[knocking at door]

468
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,338
This isn't your fault, Peña.

469
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,798
- No?
- No.

470
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,098
- I got played.
- We all got played.

471
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,101
We all had the information,
it was backed up by Centra Spike...

472
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,227
Stop.

473
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,939
Just...

474
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,362
You know, you coming here...

475
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,450
you say all the right things.

476
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,831
Doesn't make a damn bit of difference.

477
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:37,591
Colonel Carrillo's funeral
will be tomorrow.

478
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,470
[door closes]

479
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,597
I don't do funerals.

480
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:49,645
[slow Latin guitar music plays]

481
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:09,308
[in Spanish] They're saying
that Pablo himself killed Carrillo.

482
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,351
Next, he'll come after the two of you.

483
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,982
Or me, or you, Pacho.

484
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:20,068
No, no.
We've got to come up with another plan.

485
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,447
Another approach.
Another way to achieve our goals.

486
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,702
Pacho, we need to call the Castaños.

487
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,624
Soon we'll know what's in it for them.

488
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:44,676
- [rain pattering]
- [approaching footsteps]

489
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:49,765
[thunder rumbles]

490
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:10,911
Carrillo hasn't been buried yet...
and they're already asking for my head.

491
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,790
They want a scapegoat.

492
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,293
And we have to give them one.

493
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,675
[sighs]

494
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,431
That's why we're going to say that you
were poorly advised by your vice minister.

495
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,854
- We can find another way.
- Let me finish.

496
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,900
We're going to say that I acted alone
and without authorization

497
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,027
when I entered La Catedral.

498
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:48,907
And that it was I who insisted
that Carrillo return.

499
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,888
[Gaviria]
I don't accept your resignation.

500
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:02,421
Now, more than ever, the country
needs you, Eduardo. I need you.

501
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:05,007
We have to do it, César.

502
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:11,763
You know it. The attorney general,
the press, the opposition, the citizens,

503
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,808
everyone's looking for someone to blame.
All of them.

504
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,436
And it's not going to be you.

505
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:29,114
It's been my honor serving you
and the people of Colombia.

506
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,507
[softly] Good luck.

507
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:02,272
[bell tolling]

508
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,624
Limón told me you have a daughter.

509
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,586
How old?

510
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,301
- Two.
- And what's her name?

511
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:19,141
- Salome.
- What a beautiful name.

512
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,527
This is the second time
that I've felt indebted to you.

513
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:40,328
Now, Maritza...
our daughters will be safe.

514
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,582
Thank you.

515
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:50,422
Know that... you have a friend in me.

516
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,897
What did you do?

517
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,485
I took care of it.

518
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,488
You're safe now.

519
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,531
[La Quica] Limón.

520
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,798
Hey.

521
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,760
What are you doing here?

522
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,100
Where's Olivia?

523
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:28,144
She's at home. With my sister.

524
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,407
Hey, you okay?

525
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,417
- [whimpers]
- Hey.

526
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,550
[soft sobs]

527
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,988
[in Spanish]
What now?

528
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,449
What the fuck do you want?

529
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,993
I want to help you.

530
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,163
Oh, yeah?

531
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,459
Come with me and I'll show you.

532
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,055

Make yourself at home.
