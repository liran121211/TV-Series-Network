1
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,118
Here to the right.

2
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,465
Stop.

3
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,180
Stay here.

4
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,526
Who's there?

5
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,616
Relax, sir. We come in peace.

6
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,909
Stay right there!

7
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,412
Relax.

8
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,172
How are the cows?

9
00:01:55,698 --> 00:02:00,036
The cops came here... a few months ago.

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,704
What did you tell them?

11
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,957
The truth.

12
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,504
That I haven't seen you in years.

13
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,927
You've gotten old, Pablo.

14
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,976
It happens.

15
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,520
You look younger.

16
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,023
It happens.

17
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:33,611
Life in the country keeps you young.

18
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,617
Be careful, it's hot.

19
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,163
What's your name?

20
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,708
Limón, sir.

21
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,670
Don't give me that shit.
What's your real name?

22
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,797
- Jhon.
- Jhon.

23
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,258
Do you know how to milk a cow, Jhon?

24
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,636
- No, sir.
- Well, you better learn.

25
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,600
All right, gentlemen.

26
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,770
I get up at 5:00 a.m.

27
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,690
Good night.

28
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,276
Good night, Dad.

29
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,915
I read in a book somewhere
about a rich guy who goes broke.

30
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,421
When he's asked how it happened,
how he had lost everything, he answered:

31
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:02,218
"Slowly at first.
And then... all at once."

32
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,056
For Pablo Escobar,
"all at once" had finally come.

33
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,478
His empire in shambles,
his army all dead or in jail,

34
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:17,525
Escobar did the one thing
he could still do: a disappearing act.

35
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,237
One month, 14 days and seven hours...

36
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,825
with no sightings, no intercepts, nothing.

37
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,996
While we waited
for his eventual reemergence,

38
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,957
the machine built to capture him
found itself idle.

39
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,794
And that brought
a different kind of danger.

40
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,214
One that comes
with too much time to think.

41
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,595
Some started to look inward
at the path we had taken to get here...

42
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,808
asking, "How much of this blood is on me,
and how do I get clean?"

43
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,479
It is the state, not individuals,

44
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,441
that has justice in its hands
and the legitimacy to use arms.

45
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,164
Under mounting political pressure,

46
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,279
Gaviria finally publicly denounced
Los Pepes.

47
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,866
And Los Pepes responded
with their own press release.

48
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,494
They said their job was done.

49
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,205
They were packing up and going home.

50
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,209
But Los Pepes wasn't something
you could turn on and off.

51
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,836
Its members were looking to the future.

52
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,965
One without Escobar.
And they each had their own version of it.

53
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,552
Los Pepes had knocked Pablo
out of the narco business

54
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,598
and that had created a vacancy
for a new cocaine king of Medellín.

55
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:34,519
Or, depending on who you asked,
maybe a queen.

56
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:38,356
Gilberto's no longer
our partner. I don't care what he thinks.

57
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,316
Have you seen the news?

58
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,361
They issued a statement without us.

59
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,404
Los Pepes is done.

60
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,826
That's only for show.
The Castaños are still in Medellín.

61
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,119
Hmm?

62
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,079
No one told me anything.

63
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,415
Listen to me, Berna.

64
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,794
If Escobar comes through that door,
we'll kill him ourselves.

65
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,754
We don't need anybody else.

66
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,215
Start moving this product now.

67
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,134
That's all fine, Judy.

68
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,928
But if Gilberto finds out, what then?

69
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:13,057
Did you know they're offering
$1.4 million for Los Pepes?

70
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,435
I know where they are.

71
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,690
Be careful what you say.

72
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,235
That's a dangerous thought, Judy.

73
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,988
I'm not interested in the reward.

74
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,824
I'm interested in my labs.

75
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,911
Then at least tell Gilberto yourself.

76
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,084
Sir?

77
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,798
Hello.

78
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,553
And to what do I owe this lovely surprise?

79
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,723
We're at the warehouse in Manrique.

80
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,475
This place is full of product.

81
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,977
What do you want us to do?
Where do we send it?

82
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,148
Keep it. Think of it as a contribution
to your great cause

83
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,567
against the communists in the jungle.

84
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,030
I'm sure you'll find its value
can be put to good use.

85
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,448
And what do we do about Judy?

86
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,825
Do whatever you think is best.

87
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,454
Well, Gilberto, if you say so.
Thank you very much.

88
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:22,460
Fidel. Gilberto said
we can keep all of it.

89
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:28,674
What? I thought we were going home.
We don't know anything about cocaine.

90
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,761
We'll learn.

91
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,305
If they can, why not us?

92
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,600
And what about Judy? Hmm?

93
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,481
Judy feels Medellín
is only big enough for one narco.

94
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,777
We'll let the Castaños decide which one.

95
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,114
Los Pepes may have disbanded,
but that didn't mean they were done.

96
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,869
The story of a vigilante army taking down
Escobar made for great headlines.

97
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:01,582
And while no one was named, it's not
to say it wasn't cause for concern.

98
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,210
Yes, ma'am, as far as I know.

99
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,255
No, we're, uh, crystal clear on that.

100
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,715
Messina.

101
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,552
Yeah. Uh, he just got in.

102
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,351
- Hey, boss.
- Murphy fill you in?

103
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,434
Yeah.

104
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,897
This article's getting more traction
than we thought.

105
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,442
International news outlets keep calling,
want a statement from the ambassador.

106
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,861
- Are we giving one?
- No. Nobody is.

107
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,130
But we're watching it closely.

108
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,949
I don't need to tell you
it could look very bad for us.

109
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,409
I want to make sure we're covered.

110
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,828
Well, Los Pepes is disbanded.
It's basically over.

111
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:43,082
Look, I tend to agree. But the press may
shake a few more trees, see what falls.

112
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,292
What if someone talks?

113
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,420
The only people that are gonna
talk about Los Pepes is Los Pepes.

114
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,380
And they're not talking.

115
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,424
So we're covered.

116
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,800
We better be.

117
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,512
- Fabian.
- Yes?

118
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,473
- Bring the Mercedes. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.

119
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,100
Hurry up, Berna.

120
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,230
Relax, Judy.
That meeting can't start without you.

121
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,815
Mmm-hmm.

122
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,234
How many people do we have
in the laboratories?

123
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:14,363
- Forty-five in each one.
- How many supervisors?

124
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,115
Three in each.

125
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,286
- We need twice as many shifts.
- Yes, ma'am.

126
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,914
Oscar, Luis! Get in the cars.
The boss is leaving.

127
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,041
Yes, sir.

128
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,364
- Peña.
- Javier.

129
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,594
- What do you want?
- Something happened, we need to talk.

130
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,119
I'm busy. I can't talk.

131
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,288
There's been an attempt on Judy.

132
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,502
She's saying a few things
you might want to hear.

133
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,133
Give me time.

134
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,929
What's going on?

135
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,183
Nothing that's my problem anymore.

136
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,186
Where you going?

137
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,355
I just want to make sure.

138
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,694
Fuck it. I don't want to know.

139
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,374
- Peña.
- Mr. Peña has arrived.

140
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,002
Let's go. Search.

141
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:25,119
Kiko and I built all of this together.
This is all that is left for me.

142
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:29,915
What are the Castaños thinking?
That they can chase me out?

143
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,750
I'm not leaving.

144
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,919
They don't want you to leave,
they want to kill you.

145
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:40,009
And what about you?
You're in this with me too.

146
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:51,562
Look... you brought these guys here.
You got in bed with Cali.

147
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,772
This is all your doing.

148
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,734
This is a fight between narcos.
It's not my problem.

149
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,694
Don't call me again.

150
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,325
Berna, last I heard, leaking classified
intelligence is a federal offense.

151
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,620
Especially when it ends up
in the hands of a death squad

152
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,205
that's killed innocent people.

153
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:14,376
I'm sure some newspaper in America might
be interested in hearing more about that.

154
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,172
Are you threatening me?

155
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,383
Yes, I'm threatening you.

156
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,059
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

157
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,437
What do you want?

158
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,231
You're a cop.

159
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,401
You know perfectly well
where Montecasino is.

160
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,196
Where the Castaños are,
and the Rodriguezes.

161
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,490
Arrest them.

162
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,369
And when you do,
accidentally shoot them in the head.

163
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:53,249
- It doesn't work that way.
- Oh, no? Then how?

164
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,636
We'll do it my way.

165
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,599
So you want Judy to be a rat?

166
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,351
I don't agree with this, Javier.

167
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,854
We are narcos, but we have our honor.

168
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:21,861
Berna... you're a fucking drug dealer
who sells poison by the kilo.

169
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,239
Fuck your honor.

170
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,159
Says you.

171
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,872
You've been happily working
with the information we've provided.

172
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,000
And what have you done?

173
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,754
If you have a better idea, go for it.

174
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,383
Otherwise, this is the deal.

175
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,886
Judy becomes a confidential informant
to the DEA.

176
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,306
She gives us Cali, everything she knows.

177
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:56,270
If you don't like it,
you can take on the Castaños alone.

178
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,149
And you can go fuck yourself.

179
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,193
Best way to make a bad story go away

180
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,029
is to come up with a better story...

181
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,448
and sell it hard.

182
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,076
This is one of the cornerstones
of American foreign policy,

183
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,788
and one we learned through years
of trial and error in Latin America,

184
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,417
Chile, Guatemala, Panama.

185
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,003
Getting caught with your pants down sucks,

186
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,631
but if at the same time
you give the folks a big win,

187
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:28,218
like, say, dismantling the second biggest
drug cartel in the world,

188
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,221
well, then nobody's paying attention
to the bad story.

189
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,599
They're too busy patting you on the back.

190
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:38,938
Risky plan? Yes.
But pressure will force you to take risks.

191
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,315
It'll force you to do a lot of things.

192
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,068
We haven't heard anything
from him for weeks.

193
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,446
We don't even know where he is.

194
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,240
I don't know why
you're letting De Greiff come here.

195
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,117
He's coming to scare you.

196
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,245
And now you're losing faith in Pablo.

197
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,499
You don't understand, do you?

198
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,921
We don't have any more money, Hermilda.

199
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,882
If they take our protection away,
we can't do anything else.

200
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,511
Pablo has many properties.
Don't be so dramatic, Tata.

201
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,013
You think someone
is going to invest in us?

202
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,224
They're going to give us their money?

203
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,314
No one is going to help us.

204
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,651
Everyone knows what that would mean.

205
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,124
Whatever he's doing...

206
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,754
wherever my son is,
he's doing it for his family.

207
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,507
Don't forget that.

208
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:20,372
Pablo? Pablo?
Can you hear me, Pablo? Please answer.

209
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,805
Tata, can you hear me?

210
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,685
Tata?

211
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,647
Can you hear me?

212
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,685
That's a lot of product for men
who don't know how to run this business.

213
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:09,523
We have to be clear with them.
Their work isn't done.

214
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,817
Our donation to them is an advance.

215
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,487
Besides, we have to keep them happy.

216
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,283
Their connection with the Americans
is invaluable, brother.

217
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,326
What a fucking joke,

218
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,663
the CIA and their war
against the communists.

219
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:29,543
It's a joke, but that friendship
could save our lives one day.

220
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,714
What? Any news about Judy?

221
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:38,635
The Castaños took their first shot,
a bomb. But they didn't kill her.

222
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,181
Since when did it get so fucking hard
to kill someone?

223
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:46,476
What about her assistant?
The fat one, what do they call him? Berna?

224
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,563
He's the one we should kill.
She's just a loud-mouth bitch.

225
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,066
Don Berna. Him we found.

226
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,027
Where?

227
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,945
Here.

228
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,323
Out front.

229
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,001
Don Berna!

230
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,422
Welcome to Cali.

231
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,258
Gilberto, thank you, brother.

232
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,178
Forgive us, but we weren't expecting you.

233
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,141
Don't worry about it.
I'm here to speak to you all.

234
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,227
Very well, brother.

235
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,520
It's about Judy.

236
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,278
Where's Peña?

237
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,198
What do you need?

238
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,705
I got a tip. A guy.

239
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,499
He says he may have a lead, man.

240
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,003
Yeah, well, why don't you, uh,
give it to Martinez?

241
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,715
Or you could give it
to your Los Pepes pals.

242
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,885
He wants to give it to an American.

243
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,515
Yeah, what's he got? Who is this guy?

244
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,975
He's a guy I know.

245
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,895
Come on, Murphy. He's safe.
He knows I work with you.

246
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,438
What, he doesn't trust you?

247
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,153
All right. Bring him in.

248
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,197
He's in Bogotá.

249
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,534
So I gotta go to Bogotá
to meet your friend? Forget it.

250
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,495
Come on, Murphy.

251
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,622
You want Escobar, don't you?

252
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,543
Please, talk to him.

253
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,837
It's really important.

254
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,341
- All right. Set it up.
- Okay.

255
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,635
Thanks. You won't regret it.

256
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,804
In English, please!

257
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,732
Tata, are you there? Can you hear me?

258
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,842
Tata, are you there?

259
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:33,602
There's no signal here.
I don't know why you keep trying.

260
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,981
Why don't you come drink with us?

261
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,358
I'll be right there.

262
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,421
There's coffee in the Thermos.

263
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,239
He's communicating to his wife via radio.

264
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,533
Those are the codes and frequencies.

265
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,786
Pablo is using a radio.

266
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,913
That's the way he communicates
with his wife.

267
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,791
And these are the codes, Murphy.

268
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:24,421
Yeah? Where did it come from
and how did you get it?

269
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:29,301
Lugo is a fiscal at the Tequendama.
He guards the family.

270
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,389
What do you want for this? Money? Visa?

271
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,225
What do you want, Lugo? Money? Visa?

272
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,429
It don't work that way, bud.

273
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:41,938
No visa, no money, you understand?

274
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:48,528
Is that what he thinks? That
everyone wants to go to the United States?

275
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,573
I don't want anything.

276
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:56,328
All I want is for this to end soon and you
to understand the family is in pain.

277
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,788
Find him and kill him.

278
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,094
So? What do you think?

279
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,978
Javi, he's given us everything.
We got codes, frequencies.

280
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,981
- I think it's real.
- Take it to Martinez.

281
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,078
I'm at the embassy. I gotta call you back.

282
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,152
What you doing at the embassy?
What's going on?

283
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,739
Nothing I can't handle.
I'll fill you in when I can.

284
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:36,034
- Javi, let's get on this.
- Murphy, take it to Martinez.

285
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,535
I'll call you later.

286
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,122
Peña's in Bogotá?

287
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,168
Yeah, Javi's into something. Shit.

288
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,129
I'll take the codes back.
You stay with Peña, okay?

289
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,053
No fucking way. The codes are staying
with me. I'll take it to Martinez.

290
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:58,890
We give Judy immunity,
take her testimony and we are covered.

291
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,684
Don't lie to me again, Peña.

292
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:07,732
This is a tier-one narco who's
ready to flip on other tier-one narcos.

293
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,113
She's been in the business for 30 years.
She knows Cali's operation.

294
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,949
It's not intel anyone can provide.

295
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,409
She has leverage over you.

296
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,455
Her information on Escobar
crippled his business.

297
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,833
She'll do the same to Cali,
only this time for us.

298
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,004
The moment she goes on record,
her leverage is gone.

299
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,512
She doesn't get immunity
until after she talks.

300
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,931
Get her on record
and we'll see what she's got.

301
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,642
Nobody seems to want to take on Cali.

302
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,812
They've been off-limits,
but this may do the trick.

303
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,025
And Peña. Be discreet. Tell no one.

304
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,861
There are people in this building
who won't like it.

305
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,248
Going down?

306
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,844
So... how's it going?

307
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,914
What are you doing, Pablo?

308
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,584
You don't know how to tie a knot.

309
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,055
This is a cowboy's knot.
This is really good.

310
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:40,593
Wanted: Pablo Escobar.
Reward 2,700,000 pesos.

311
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:45,098
Call for free from any city
at 9-800-10-600.

312
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:51,187
In Bogotá, 222-50-12.
In Medellín, 461-11-11.

313
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,458
The kids would love to be here.

314
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,923
I've been thinking...

315
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,763
I could buy some land here next to you.

316
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,895
Some cows, maybe some sheep.

317
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,317
And have my own farm.

318
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,541
We could run it together.

319
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,758
What do you think?

320
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,277
We need to finish putting up the wire.

321
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,211
Do you remember when the soldiers
came to our village?

322
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:26,217
You were a tough little boy,
probably only seven or eight years old.

323
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:32,098
But even in that moment,
you were already the man of the house.

324
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:39,898
In the face of all that
violence and death, you were strong.

325
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,609
You are a survivor.

326
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,278
A man of action.

327
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:50,617
I knew that day you were destined
for great things, Pablo.

328
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,079
- Good evening.
- Colonel.

329
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,456
Sit.

330
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,920
So, did you decipher those codes?
Are they real?

331
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,714
Yes, Colonel. I verified the frequencies.

332
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,008
The codes are the same ones
Escobar's wife is using.

333
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:11,179
- He'll use them when he calls her.
- Did you confirm it's Escobar?

334
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,262
Did you hear him?

335
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,058
No, Colonel, not yet.

336
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,020
All right, say he picks up
the phone. How close can we get?

337
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,649
If Pablo talks in Medellín,
we'll know every word he says.

338
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,277
- Can you get his exact location?
- If it's within range, yes.

339
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,616
All right, if Pablo uses the phone
outside of Medellín with the same codes,

340
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,909
can you hear him?

341
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,581
No. The antenna is not that strong.

342
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:06,234
Why didn't you answer me when I asked
about me coming here with my family?

343
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,445
I wasn't paying that much attention.

344
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,740
But you're paying attention to me now,
right?

345
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,497
So, what do you think?

346
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,002
- It's a nice idea.
- Yes, it's a nice idea.

347
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,841
It's a nice idea, now help me.
Put that bucket down here.

348
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,142
Now hold on to the pig.

349
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,312
Fuck!

350
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,234
Funny that you don't like blood.

351
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,487
How strange.

352
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,323
What are you trying to say?

353
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,414
Clean yourself.

354
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,675
You know what's funny?

355
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,308
That my dad...

356
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:27,440
has no fucking idea who I am.

357
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,945
- I know very well who you are.
- Mmm.

358
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:39,285
Did you know that I was
one of the world's richest men?

359
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,536
Is that right?

360
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,790
You know the President
of the United States knows who I am?

361
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,459
- The United States? Disgusting.
- Mmm.

362
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:52,256
I was elected to the
House of Representatives of this country.

363
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,803
Your last name is known throughout
the whole world because of what I did.

364
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,015
- So what? So what? So what?!
- So what?!

365
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,894
And what about you? What about you?!

366
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:13,236
Ignorant old man. Who lives alone.

367
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,114
On this shithole farm.

368
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,868
Who doesn't know his own grandchildren.

369
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,039
Not even one fucking picture of them here.

370
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,544
Mmm.

371
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,630
So I'm nothing more than
an ignorant old man?

372
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,967
That's right.

373
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,932
Now tell me...

374
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,768
Tell me...

375
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,231
what you think of me.

376
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,280
- Who cares?
- I do.

377
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,117
It's important to me.

378
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:08,166
You wanted to come live on this farm
with your wife and kids.

379
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,461
But that's not possible, Pablo.

380
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,382
You chose your life!

381
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,843
Be in charge of it.

382
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,222
You want me to tell you
what I think of you?

383
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,226
I'm ashamed.

384
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,858
I think you're a murderer.

385
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,948
At last, the truth.

386
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,705
At last, the truth.

387
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,209
A truth...

388
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,048
that breaks my heart.

389
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,888
Leave me alone.

390
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,800
Limón.

391
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,845
Yes, sir?

392
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,061
You like it here, right?

393
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,731
Yes, boss. It's a peaceful place.

394
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,859
Peaceful.

395
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,824
Kneel down.

396
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:22,675
A few kilometers from here, in a field,
you will find a big tree.

397
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,638
Under that tree is a buried case of money.

398
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,017
Go get it.

399
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,351
Are we leaving, boss?

400
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,729
Yes.

401
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,897
Go on.

402
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,960
That's correct, Mrs. Escobar.

403
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:02,548
How long did you think this arrangement
was going to last?

404
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,885
Do you not realize that if
we leave here, they're going to kill us?

405
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:12,725
If you desire, you have the right
to contract private security services.

406
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:16,270
Tell us how. We don't have a dime.

407
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:20,775
That is not our problem.
Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry.

408
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,151
You're sorry?

409
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,654
Then help us find asylum
in another country.

410
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,700
I don't have an issue with you
leaving Colombia. But...

411
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,744
But you can't help us find asylum.

412
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,543
That's bullshit!

413
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,004
They're going to...

414
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,382
...kill us all.

415
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,468
Mama, what's wrong?

416
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,973
Nothing, my love.

417
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,071
I'm sorry, Attorney General...

418
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,867
but I don't know what else to do.

419
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:23,045
If you're in contact with your husband,
I advise you to express your concern.

420
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,047
Tell him to surrender.

421
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:30,636
The power of the law is your last hope.

422
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,806
Think about your children.

423
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,937
Shit.

424
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,517
- No.
- Yes, before you go to sleep.

425
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,853
- Do you like it? Yes?
- No. No.

426
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,638
Fuck.

427
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,726
Jhon. What are you doing here?

428
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:34,820
Where is the money?
The money we gave you. I need it back.

429
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,531
We spent it. It's gone.

430
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,451
Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.

431
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,290
You've already hurt me.

432
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,418
You fucked up my life.

433
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:00,596
I want to put the baby in her crib.
Can I put her down?

434
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,599
Hang on, Maritza.

435
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,493
And this?

436
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,626
That's all we have, Jhon.
It's all we have. We need it.

437
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:34,963
Please, don't take it. Please.
It's for the baby, please!

438
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,717
You lying... bitch! Get off!

439
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,595
Motherfucker! Bastard!

440
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,432
I should turn you in for the reward!
You deserve it!

441
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:49,228
Sooner or later, they'll find you anyway.

442
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,481
What did you say?

443
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:57,211
Are you going to say something? Hmm?
Are you going to rat on me?

444
00:44:57,277 --> 00:45:00,697
I might! Why shouldn't I?

445
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:07,413
- What? So now you're a killer?
- Like your hero?

446
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,915
Jhon!

447
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,335
I know you! Get that shit out...

448
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,102
- Boss, I did what you asked.
- Show me.

449
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,189
But I have bad news.

450
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,316
- What happened?
- Look.

451
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,576
It's rotten, sir.

452
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,591
There was half a million dollars
in that fucking case.

453
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,728
This is what I could retrieve, sir.

454
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:57,314
There's about six thousand dollars.
I counted, boss.

455
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,911
Get your things. We're leaving.

456
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,624
Remember, you and I
are partners in all this.

457
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:20,003
Everything's set.
We have to do this tonight.

458
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,087
Where?

459
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,215
It's a safe house in El Poblado.

460
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,175
We've used it before.

461
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,886
Berna knows where.

462
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,097
I'll see you there.

463
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,909
Everything is ready, Judy. Get in.

464
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,745
Let's go, Flaco.

465
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,171
She's on her way.

466
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,555
I know what you're thinking.

467
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,644
I'm making a mistake.

468
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:22,816
You'll be taken care of
like you've taken care of me.

469
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:26,361
The only thing that needs to happen
is to get rid of the Cali cartel.

470
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,613
Up here, Flaco.

471
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,379
I can't protect a rat.

472
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:05,025
I didn't think you'd betray me.

473
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,612
You were going to get yourself killed,
Judy.

474
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,282
So now, you're going to get on that plane.

475
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,285
And if I don't, what? What happens?

476
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,330
If you don't get on,
then you'll leave with the Castaños.

477
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,457
And I won't protect you anymore.

478
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,240
Tell me something.

479
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,576
Did Cali arrange this?

480
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,581
How much did they offer you?
At least tell me that.

481
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:05,711
It's a mutual understanding.
I'll work with the Castaños.

482
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:11,216
They don't understand our business,
but they'll be useful in mine.

483
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:15,053
- So you fucked over your partner.
- I was never your partner.

484
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,848
I only protected your life.

485
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:23,895
Relax. You'll have money.

486
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:27,232
The Americans said they'd make sure
you had everything you need.

487
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,986
- Where am I going?
- Doesn't matter.

488
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:36,533
Go. And never come back to Colombia.

489
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,833
Don't worry about a thing.

490
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:51,214
You'll still be a rat, but for the CIA,
instead of the DEA.

491
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,072
Hey, man. How's it going?

492
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,075
Everything good at the safe house?

493
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,954
- Where's Messina?
- Oh, she's gone.

494
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,792
Reassigned. Headed home.

495
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:30,879
Likely to spend the rest of her career
busting meth labs in Indianapolis.

496
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,215
Something about chain of command.

497
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,884
- And Judy?
- You didn't hear?

498
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:41,848
Judy has an interview
with the Miami Herald in, uh...

499
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,850
oh, about five hours.

500
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,896
Now I can't be certain,
but I bet she has a story to tell

501
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:52,192
about the involvement of a certain
DEA agent with Los Pepes.

502
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,489
All I know for sure is,
whatever Judy has to say,

503
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,658
it won't be pointed in my direction.

504
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:02,911
You should've stayed in your lane.

505
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,205
Wow.

506
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,375
And Cali too, right?

507
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,586
They get a pass?

508
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,801
How much do they pay you
for your protection?

509
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,219
Pay me?

510
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,890
Let me tell you something, Agent Peña.

511
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,102
Maybe it'll make you feel better,
but maybe not.

512
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:32,691
We're gonna get them someday.
But not your way.

513
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:37,904
For everything you know, you're, uh...
extremely naive.

514
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,657
Anyway, I've enjoyed this.

515
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,409
The laughs.

516
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,452
Um... Oh.

517
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,580
I think the ambassador wants to see you.

518
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,418
I guess word about this Miami Herald thing
is spreading like a prairie fire.

519
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:53,837
And bring your passport.

520
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,715
I think you're going home, but...

521
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,093
you didn't hear that from me.

522
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,616
Tata?

523
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,415
Tata, can you hear me?

524
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,542
Pablo?

525
00:54:58,294 --> 00:54:59,963
It's me, my love.

526
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,049
Finally, I can speak to you, my love.

527
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,301
I've missed you so much.

528
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,013
Where have you been, Pablo?

529
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:14,102
I had to do something very important.

530
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,525
But I'm back home, my love.

531
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,655
I'm home.
