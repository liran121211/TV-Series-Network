00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:29,471
(no audible dialogue)

2
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:36,187
(indistinct chatter in Spanish)

3
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:39,064
(in Spanish)
Good morning, Sergeant.

4
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,607
Good morning, Paisa.
What have you got for us?

5
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:46,612
I've got plumbing valves,
a bunch of clean towels,

6
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,699
and extra uniforms for the guards.

7
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,335
Let him go. He's been checked.

8
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:01,337
Continue. Continue, Paisa.

9
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:03,213
Thank you, Sergeant.

10
00:01:03,214 --> 00:01:05,007
- Good day.
- Good day.

11
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:08,468
- Good day, Paisa.
- (Paisa) Thank you! Good day, Sergeant.

12
00:01:18,354 --> 00:01:21,356
(Steve)
Escobar's prison was called La Catedral,

13
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:24,151
but we nicknamed it "Club Medellín."

14
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,321
It was the embodiment of "the big lie."

15
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:31,241
It was even built
to look old and shitty on the outside.

16
00:01:31,242 --> 00:01:34,661
But inside, it was anything but.

17
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,332
The other inmates?
Escobar's sicarios.

18
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,086
Hand-picked killers from his hometown.

19
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:47,048
(in Spanish)
You're here, my friend!

20
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:49,800
- How you doing, Velasco?
- Good, brother. How was the trip?

21
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:51,844
Fine, fine.
What a long drive!

22
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,637
- Really?
- It's really hot.

23
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:55,056
Did you encounter any problems?

24
00:01:55,057 --> 00:01:57,808
Nothing. Perfect. Complete success.

25
00:01:57,809 --> 00:02:02,063
I brought everything, including
the special items requested by Pablo.

26
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:03,856
- What's going on, buddy?
- Blackie!

27
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,485
- I thought you forgot about us.
- Let me show you.

28
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:13,991
Oh, my God. All right, boys!
Get a ladder over here!

29
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:18,121
(Steve) The sicarios weren't the only guys
in the prison who worked for Escobar.

30
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:19,789
The guards did, too.

31
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,292
- (Velasco) Welcome to La Catedral.
- (woman) Hello.

32
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:26,212
- Come on down, ladies.
- (overlapping chatter in Spanish)

33
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,340
We'll take care of you.

34
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,346
(Steve)
By the terms of his deal,

35
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:40,310
no cops or military were allowed
within two miles of the prison.

36
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:44,439
As much as I fucking hated this guy,
I had to hand it to him...

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,524
he had a pretty sweet deal.

38
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,739
- (overlapping chatter in Spanish)
- (up-tempo Latin music playing)

39
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:02,624
Come on! Hurry up!
What? Is it heavy?

40
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,962
- That looks delicious, Paisa.
- (Paisa murmurs) All right, lobsters.

41
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,801
- (music continues)
- (laughs)

42
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,725
(cheers, whistling)

43
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:36,241
(inhaling)

44
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:48,127
(Steve) Escobar hadn't
built himself a prison at all.

45
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,714
He'd built himself a fortress.

46
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:55,260
But no matter how you decorate it...
a cage is still a cage.

47
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:25,541
(in Spanish) Excuse me, boss.

48
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:27,750
I've got a report.

49
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:30,545
Moncada and Galeano
are reporting that we got 10,000 kilos

50
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:32,922
through Mexico and the Caribbean.

51
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:35,091
Did they pay the war tax?

52
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:38,469
Yes, boss, but ever since
you settled things with the government,

53
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,764
a lot of other people
have been complaining.

54
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:48,145
My expenses in and out of the prison
must be covered by everyone.

55
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:49,314
Understood.

56
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:53,277
Moncada and Galeano said the Cali cartel
are preparing for a ceasefire.

57
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:54,945
Mm.

58
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,406
As am I.

59
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:03,077
We're going to negotiate a truce.

60
00:05:03,078 --> 00:05:06,957
But first,
we're going to kill a few of his men.

61
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:13,670
I'm sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel
is going to take that as an act of war,

62
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:15,424
don't you think?

63
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:20,095
(exhales deeply)

64
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,934
The purpose of war...

65
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,895
is peace.

66
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:35,401
(Steve) If there was one benefit
to Escobar's imprisonment,

67
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:38,488
it's that peace
had finally come to Bogotá.

68
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:42,492
Connie and I took advantage
and began adoption proceedings.

69
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:44,828
The war had left many orphans.

70
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:48,581
One... we could do something about.

71
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:52,585
(in English) Oh, you like the pink ones,
don't you? Yeah, you do.

72
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,130
Oh, orchids, look!

73
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:58,383
What's this one? "Cattleya."

74
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:01,469
It means "graceful." Hm.

75
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,722
- That describes me perfectly.
- (laughs)

76
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:12,438
Oh, buying baby things
and plants for the apartment...

77
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,482
we're a family.

78
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:16,609
We're domesticated animals.

79
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,319
- You want this one?
- Yeah.

80
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,989
- You want that one? Yeah.
- (baby grunts)

81
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:23,200
(horns honking)

82
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,496
(Steve) How about Elizabeth?

83
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:30,332
After my mother?
Are you kidding?

84
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:36,296
What is "Elizabeth" in Spanish?
Is it "Isabel"? Isabel's nice.

85
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:39,799
- I've always liked "Olivia."
- Olivia's OK.

86
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:45,138
(thudding)

87
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:47,098
(Steve) Fuck.

88
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,519
- Shit!
- (baby wailing)

89
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,106
- (man in Spanish) What's the deal?
- Steve...

90
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,692
(man)
Look what you've done to my car.

91
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,734
- (in Spanish) Where?
- Look at this traffic jam.

92
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:01,153
- Look what you did to my car!
- Ah! It's nothing.

93
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,072
- How am I gonna drive this?
- It's nothing.

94
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:05,032
Look at the fucking traffic jam
this is causing.

95
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,033
Yeah, man!

96
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:08,328
(baby sobbing)

97
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:12,289
And you don't even speak Spanish?
Get out of here.

98
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,291
- Don't mess with me, asshole.
- Easy, man.

99
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:18,963
Son of a bitch. Are you gonna hit me?
What the hell have you come here for, fag?

100
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,716
I deserve respect, you son of a bitch.
So that's it, then.

101
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:24,428
What, are you gonna hit me?
You and who else?

102
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:26,679
(whispers)
Oh, my...

103
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,350
OK, take it easy.
It's all right. It's OK now.

104
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,228
- (gasps)
- (baby shrieks)

105
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:35,438
- Calm down, asshole.
- OK?

106
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,065
- Relax, man. OK.
- OK?

107
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,984
OK, calm down.

108
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,654
(man) Have some tolerance.

109
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,369
- (baby continues crying)
- (sighs)

110
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,124
(starts engine)

111
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:57,294
Yeah, I like "Olivia."

113
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:42,022
- (Ana in Spanish) Do you hear that?
- (Gaviria) What?

114
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:45,861
People. Children. Laughter.

115
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:49,364
Even the vendors are back out.

116
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:56,412
And all because we gave Escobar
the keys to his own prison. (gentle scoff)

117
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,664
You did the right thing.

118
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,291
You think?

119
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,462
You should be happy.

120
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,716
Finally, people can return
to their normal lives.

121
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:11,595
Finally... we are at peace.

122
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:38,747
(in Spanish) We spoke with Pablo,
and he is willing to negotiate.

123
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:46,129
(Pacho)
Ten of my men have just been killed.

124
00:10:46,337 --> 00:10:48,924
Is that how you guys
begin negotiations?

125
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,342
Two things, Pacho.

126
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:58,307
First... Mr. Galeano and I
had nothing to do with those deaths.

127
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:02,728
And the second thing...
this is war, Pacho.

128
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:06,775
There are deaths everywhere,
and we have casualties as well.

129
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,739
We are willing
to pay three million dollars

130
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,201
- to settle the dispute in Los Angeles.
- (Galeano chuckles)

131
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:22,039
Pablo won't accept anything
under $12 million, Pacho.

132
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:27,211
(Galeano)
Twelve million is nothing to you.

133
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:33,343
Do you want to know something?

134
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:35,887
It's over.

135
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,263
What's over?

136
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,558
- The Medellín cartel.
- (laughs)

137
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,937
No, you're wrong, Pacho.

138
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:47,230
We export twice the amount you do.

139
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:50,986
You invited me here
to give me this line of bullshit?

140
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:57,115
Pablo put a war tax on the two of you
for $250,000 a month.

141
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,034
That's how he treats
his friends and associates?

142
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:04,331
Don't forget that, thanks to
Mr. Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria,

143
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:08,628
extradition was abolished.
That serves you very well, doesn't it?

144
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:11,338
He was the one
who got us into this mess.

145
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:16,177
Killing politicians and cops,
bombing street corners and airplanes.

146
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:19,389
He started this fucking war.

147
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:23,643
Are we going to negotiate or not?

148
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:31,651
(Steve) As part of Escobar's
surrender deal, Search Bloc was disbanded,

149
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,904
and Colonel Carrillo
was transferred out of the country.

150
00:12:34,905 --> 00:12:39,616
For the time being,
Carrillo's war was over.

151
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:42,536
(in English) I don't see why
they're sending you to Spain.

152
00:12:42,537 --> 00:12:44,078
It's not like the cocaine war is over.

153
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,916
Galeano and Moncada
are fronting for Escobar.

154
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:50,003
My superiors say I play too rough.

155
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:56,175
At least Escobar is in jail and... you can
leave knowing you helped put him there.

156
00:12:57,969 --> 00:12:59,303
Jail?

157
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,975
I know you gringos
aren't allowed to do flyovers, but um...

158
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,479
I got some photographs,
courtesy of the Colombian military.

159
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:14,945
I want you to look at 'em,
tell me if this qualifies as a jail.

160
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,409
(Steve)
He's got a fucking soccer field.

161
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,619
Escobar is moving more coke than ever.

162
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,913
Without the Colombian government
breathing down his neck,

163
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:28,291
all he's gotta worry about
is the Cali cartel.

164
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:33,170
Let's face it, fellas...

165
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:37,383
he won.

166
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:41,762
(doors open)

167
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:43,680
(Paisa in Spanish)
We're here, gentlemen!

168
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:45,100
(groans)

169
00:13:46,101 --> 00:13:48,268
(indistinct chatter in Spanish)

170
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:50,938
- Gentlemen!
- (Moncada) What a bumpy ride, Paisa.

171
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:53,190
Where did you learn to drive?

172
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:56,860
(Moncada)
We closed the deal at ten million dollars.

173
00:13:56,861 --> 00:14:00,197
This takes care of the problem
we had in LA and ends the war.

174
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:03,993
(Velasco)
Sounds like a good proposition.

175
00:14:03,994 --> 00:14:06,328
Do you know what this means, boss?

176
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:10,206
We can maintain our infrastructure
and the government won't be the wiser.

177
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:15,505
That way, we can... double our exports
in less than a month, Pablo.

178
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:21,344
How did he behave...

179
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:24,388
when he offered you the money?

180
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,518
What do you mean,
"how did he behave"?

181
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,354
What was his attitude?

182
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:34,691
Well... he was respectful, Pablo.

183
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,692
Respectful in what way?

184
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:39,862
- He wants peace, just like us.
- Yes, but...

185
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:42,907
how did he react
when you told him our solution?

186
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,741
In a positive manner.

187
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:47,078
He just offered you the money,
just like that?

188
00:14:48,997 --> 00:14:53,334
Well... he started
at three million dollars. Right?

189
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:55,419
- Mm.
- (Galeano) But we said no,

190
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,337
and told him
you wouldn't take less than 12.

191
00:14:57,338 --> 00:15:01,551
So he offered ten,
and we felt that was a fair deal.

192
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:04,971
Offered you three million?

193
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:10,185
He was feeling us out.
He knew we wouldn't accept that.

194
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:16,149
If he really respected me,
he would be grateful if I accepted 20.

195
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,778
That's right, boss.
Ask for 20. In one shot.

196
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:29,495
Tell him I'm not happy
with less than 30.

197
00:15:30,705 --> 00:15:32,540
The Cali cartel won't accept that, Pablo.

198
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:36,961
Thirty million...
if Cali wants peace.

199
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,738
Very good.

200
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:15,083
I also need to raise the war tax.

201
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:21,337
From now on,
a million a month,

202
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:25,009
for both of you...
and all our other partners.

203
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:36,980
Good move beating him,
you son of a bitch.

204
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:44,527
(in English) If we get proof that Escobar
is violating the terms of his surrender,

205
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:46,238
then they have to send him
to a real prison,

206
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,157
but we need more
than these aerial shots.

207
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:50,492
Can you get us satellite communications
or wire intercepts?

208
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:53,162
There's a no-fly zone over the prison,
with antiaircraft guns

209
00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:55,455
manned by the Colombian army
to enforce it.

210
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:57,457
You're playing with fire
if Noonan finds out.

211
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,542
We don't got shit on him
without intercepts.

212
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:01,628
- Don't need 'em.
- What? The hell we don't.

213
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,298
They're not using phones.

214
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,675
- The hell is that?
- I could spot a coop a mile away.

215
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:08,719
That's how they're sending messages.

216
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,850
(Steve)
To avoid our high-tech spy planes,

217
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:18,812
Pablo chose the most
low-tech form of communication.

218
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:21,024
Never said the guy wasn't crafty.

219
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,196
- You see anything yet?
- No, man.

220
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:29,157
You're blind as a bat.
Give me those.

221
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:45,172
- (fluttering)
- Oh, one's goin'.

222
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:48,343
- Ten o'clock. Comin' in low.
- (Javier) I got it.

223
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,344
- You got it?
- Yeah.

224
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:51,387
Low.

225
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:55,975
Ah...

226
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:57,433
(twittering)

227
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:59,187
(Javier)
That's a fast fucking pigeon.

228
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:01,980
Give me the gun.

229
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:05,275
- You trying to say I'm a lousy shot?
- Yes, I am saying you're a lousy shot.

230
00:18:05,276 --> 00:18:06,569
Here.

231
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:10,990
You're a shit shot.

232
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:13,116
- (Javier) Heads up, heads up.
- I got it.

233
00:18:13,117 --> 00:18:15,036
- (Javier) One o'clock.
- I got it.

234
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:17,121
Shoot.

235
00:18:17,955 --> 00:18:18,915
Shoot!

236
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:25,380
Ever been duck huntin'?

237
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:33,596
No, I have not been duck hunting,
you... fucking hillbilly.

238
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:43,147
- (chuckles)
- Bingo.

239
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:48,611
It's in Spanish. Read it.

240
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:56,035
(Javier) "Delivery due
with El Paisa in the tunnel."

241
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:00,497
The son of a bitch
built a tunnel under the jail.

242
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,919
(in Spanish) We talked with Pablo
and reached an agreement.

243
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,255
- (woman) Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.

244
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,841
We agreed to...

245
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:14,553
- one million dollars.
- What?

246
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:19,434
Right.

247
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:24,604
What about the house in Cartagena?

248
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:26,481
That's not happening, right?

249
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:28,900
Do you want your house in Cartagena?

250
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,654
- Of course.
- OK... you will have it.

251
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:34,239
Don't you see
things are improving?

252
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,201
No, I see things
are getting more complicated.

253
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,872
Instead of getting better...
things are getting worse.

254
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,041
Mm-hm.

255
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,838
Pablo doesn't want peace with Cali.

256
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,924
Now, what about this war tax
he's charging you?

257
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,845
$250,000 was a lot of money.

258
00:19:56,846 --> 00:20:00,056
And now a million?
(scoffs) Ridiculous.

259
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:04,227
What do you think I should do?
Call Pablo and tell him I won't pay it?

260
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:06,646
- Obviously not.
- Then I don't understand.

261
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:11,735
- What do you want me to do?
- It's not right, Kiko, and you know it.

262
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:14,863
(sighs)

263
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:18,742
Look, I... adore Pablo.
I adore him.

264
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:25,041
But the thing is, I don't know
what's going on with him these days.

265
00:20:31,714 --> 00:20:34,300
I don't know.
Maybe he's depressed.

266
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:40,264
We're here in a Jacuzzi...

267
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:43,142
free.

268
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:49,481
- Do you love me?
- Oh...

269
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,985
Stop fucking around.
You make me angry.

270
00:20:56,906 --> 00:21:01,493
(in English) Against orders, we did
high-altitude flyovers of the prison

271
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,953
- with our infrared cameras.
- No tunnels.

272
00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:07,874
Tomography report indicates nothing.
Seismic measuring, nada.

273
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,419
Can we measure radio frequency energy?

274
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:12,212
Well, we could try.
Doesn't penetrate deeper than 30 feet.

275
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:15,258
If he's bringing shit into this tunnel,
you can bet he's going out that way.

276
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:19,053
If there's a tunnel there,
he must have dug it to China.

277
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:20,596
Good luck.

278
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,065
Maybe we can... (sighs)

279
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:35,277
We can ask the military
to do light detection and ranging.

280
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:38,489
We got a better chance of Noonan
authorizing a divining rod.

281
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:41,866
(scoffs)

282
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,702
- All right, man, I'm calling it a night.
- Nah, finish up.

283
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,705
No, you can't even smoke in here.

284
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:51,668
No luck?

285
00:21:52,503 --> 00:21:56,590
These aerials don't indicate
a single tunnel in the whole mountainside.

286
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:58,174
Hm.

287
00:21:58,175 --> 00:22:01,345
Well, the only thing I can see
in all of them is this truck.

288
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:06,601
- Are you finished with that, honey?
- Yeah.

289
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:14,691
(Paisa whistling)

290
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:30,957
(brakes squeaking)

291
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,502
(Paisa in Spanish) What happened?

292
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,962
Did it stop?

293
00:22:36,631 --> 00:22:37,964
Good morning.

294
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:39,715
- What's up?
- Are you "The Paisa"?

295
00:22:39,716 --> 00:22:42,718
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you. Javier Peña.

296
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:45,889
Do me a favor
and get out of the truck.

297
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:51,646
- (Paisa) What's going on?
- (Javier) Don't be afraid.

298
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,150
Up against the truck.

299
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:03,824
Let's go.

300
00:23:05,742 --> 00:23:08,077
Do me another favor.

301
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:09,580
Open it up.

302
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:19,549
Go on.

303
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,934
(Javier in English)
We missed a very important delivery.

304
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:37,483
Sex toys, back issues of Hustler,
a waterbed, a legal correspondence course.

305
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:40,902
(chuckles)
He's bored shitless in there.

306
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:44,322
(in Spanish) Look, gringos...
you don't have the right to do this.

307
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,740
Of course we have the right.

308
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:52,830
You just press the button in the truck
and we will do the rest, OK?

309
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:57,835
If the boss finds out that I let you
put cameras in the truck, he'll kill me.

310
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:58,921
(in English)
What did he say?

311
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:01,215
He says if Pablo finds out,
he'll kill him.

312
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:04,427
Amigo...

313
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,223
(in Spanish) Pablo's your boss?

314
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:12,518
Yeah? Yeah.

315
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,193
(gasping)

316
00:24:22,236 --> 00:24:25,905
I am your boss. Yes?

317
00:24:25,906 --> 00:24:28,575
It's OK, it's OK!
I'll do whatever you say.

318
00:24:28,576 --> 00:24:29,910
Yeah?

319
00:24:36,584 --> 00:24:38,835
Are you OK, friend?

320
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,510
(up-tempo Latin music playing)

321
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:55,269
(camera clicking)

322
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:13,412
(Paisa) Good day.

323
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:27,925
(in English) So what is this?
What am I looking at exactly?

324
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:31,012
- Club Medellín.
- This was all shipped in to La Catedral.

325
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:34,308
We got some big-screen TVs,
nice stereo equipment.

326
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:37,644
That's a roulette wheel,
a little bit of liquor.

327
00:25:37,645 --> 00:25:41,357
Glad to see the judges could come down
with the official from the airport.

328
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:44,193
Javi's pretty keen on this Jacuzzi.

329
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:47,363
Don't forget the jukebox
with the hookers.

330
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:49,615
Of course, the lobster.

331
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,539
- (Gaviria in Spanish) This is a--
- Yes, it's a roulette wheel.

332
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,626
He has a casino
right there at La Catedral.

333
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:05,630
- Where did you get these pictures?
- From the DEA.

334
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:07,549
Of course.

335
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,551
It's not just these pictures.

336
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:12,387
They also have pictures of judges,
local government people,

337
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:17,351
other narcos, prostitutes...
Even soccer players come to visit Pablo.

338
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:23,189
- Who else has seen these?
- No one, as far as I know.

339
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,569
- That's why we have to act now.
- (sighs)

340
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,656
Do you think the DEA is capable
of leaking the photos to the media?

341
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:36,412
The DEA is capable of anything.
That's why we have to do something now.

342
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,918
At one time, Escobar...
used to own all of Colombia.

343
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:48,006
Now he's just the owner
of his own prison.

344
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:54,346
If I had to choose
between prostitutes at La Catedral...

345
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:57,015
or bombings in the country...

346
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:01,520
(sighs)

347
00:27:02,897 --> 00:27:06,108
I would be eternally grateful
to these women.

348
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:15,743
(together) Happy birthday, Pablo!

349
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,038
- Watch your step.
- (woman) Careful with the little girl!

350
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:21,706
(overlapping chatter)

351
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,208
(Velasco) How are you? Welcome.

352
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:27,546
- Happy birthday.
- Hello, sweetheart.

353
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,800
(lively Latin music playing)

354
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,476
(man singing in Spanish)

355
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:54,322
They're the ones I hired?
I don't believe you.

356
00:27:54,323 --> 00:27:58,576
They are really good, Blackie.
I like them.

357
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:03,790
Come on, Pablo, tell us...
what are you doing these days? Hm!

358
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:06,710
- How do you spend your time?
- Aside from missing his family?

359
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,253
Oh! Of course.

360
00:28:09,546 --> 00:28:12,131
- He's writing a book.
- Mm!

361
00:28:12,132 --> 00:28:14,134
- Mother.
- What?

362
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:17,721
Isn't it true?
You are writing a book.

363
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,807
Please, Mom.

364
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:21,558
Well, then, you tell them.

365
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,185
(laughs)

366
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:30,358
- It's a collection of magazine articles.
- Many articles.

367
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:34,570
- Clippings. It's a book of cartoons.
- Oh, cartoons!

368
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:37,240
From newspapers and magazines
all over the world.

369
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,910
And you know what?
People write him every day.

370
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,495
- (Hermilda) It's because they love him.
- (woman) I can imagine.

371
00:28:42,496 --> 00:28:45,624
You have to find ways
to keep your mind occupied around here.

372
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:50,419
Yes, my love. And you have Judy's husband
and Galeano to help you with the business.

373
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,715
Yes, on that note,
Kiko is so grateful to you

374
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:56,175
for all the responsibilities
you have given him.

375
00:28:56,176 --> 00:28:57,678
Thank you very much.

376
00:28:57,887 --> 00:28:59,595
- We were in Cartagena--
- (Hermilda) Where?

377
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:01,891
- We were in Cartagena last week.
- Oh, yeah?

378
00:29:02,098 --> 00:29:05,393
Oh, yes, we spent
some beautiful days there relaxing.

379
00:29:05,394 --> 00:29:07,270
It must feel good
to be able to relax like that.

380
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,731
- How nice.
- Wonderful, Tata. You can't imagine.

381
00:29:09,732 --> 00:29:12,441
But I'll tell you,
Cartagena is really expensive.

382
00:29:12,442 --> 00:29:15,319
Oh, it's unaffordable.

383
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,823
Besides, this whole "war with Cali" thing,

384
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,993
it's tough, you know,
with the tax we have to pay.

385
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:26,330
We understand it's not easy,
but there's not much we can do.

386
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,875
It's OK.

387
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:37,426
Kiko complained about that?

388
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,097
He mentioned it.

389
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:48,394
He didn't complain, Pablo,
he didn't complain.

390
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:52,566
Everyone here is absolutely aware
of the huge sacrifice that you're making,

391
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:55,402
for God's sake.
So I think it's normal, right?

392
00:29:55,611 --> 00:29:57,237
It's normal that
we'd give you our support.

393
00:29:57,446 --> 00:30:00,866
Well, I think it's normal...
I really do.

394
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:09,248
Juan Pablito, go play with your dad
for a little while, OK?

395
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:12,086
Honey, you should
play with the kids a little bit.

396
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,093
Leave the gift here.

397
00:30:19,843 --> 00:30:21,177
I'll look after it.

398
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:30,687
(low chatter in Spanish)

399
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,440
(lively music continues)

400
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,073
(Steve sighs)

401
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:47,079
The word from Sandoval is, Gaviria isn't
gonna do shit about Escobar's violations.

402
00:30:50,124 --> 00:30:52,417
Carrillo was right. He won.

403
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:55,796
What are those?

404
00:30:57,297 --> 00:31:00,467
These are a list of, uh...
my accomplishments.

405
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:09,476
- (overlapping gunfire)
- (screaming)

406
00:31:21,237 --> 00:31:22,865
You shred these.

407
00:31:29,913 --> 00:31:32,374
(overlapping chatter in Spanish)

408
00:31:40,757 --> 00:31:43,802
(chatter continues)

409
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:53,687
(excited chatter)

410
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:00,861
(grunts)

411
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:04,030
(overlapping chatter)

412
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:05,199
Apologize!

413
00:32:05,448 --> 00:32:06,949
Apologize!

414
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,493
Apologize!

415
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:12,329
- Were you watching?
- Yes.

416
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,998
You apologize!

417
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,918
I'm sorry, boss.

418
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:18,837
I didn't mean it.

419
00:32:24,885 --> 00:32:26,552
- Relax.
- Are you all right, boss?

420
00:32:26,553 --> 00:32:28,930
Relax. That's how the game goes.

421
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:31,516
Go on, go on.
You guys continue.

422
00:32:34,644 --> 00:32:36,230
Are you all right, sir?

423
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:39,691
(Velasco) Boss.

424
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,861
Excuse me, boss,
but I need to speak to you.

425
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,280
Everything OK?

426
00:32:46,823 --> 00:32:50,119
- Boss, we have a problem.
- What problem?

427
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:53,162
You remember that Moncada and Galeano
had a large shipment

428
00:32:53,163 --> 00:32:56,916
- that was seized in Boyacá?
- Yes.

429
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:59,961
- 250 kilos.
- Exactly.

430
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:04,339
Can you imagine, a farmer found
three million dollars buried in a field?

431
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,759
Do you know where that was, boss?

432
00:33:07,343 --> 00:33:08,804
In Rionegro.

433
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:14,810
(Steve) True story. And pay attention,
because it changes a lot of lives.

434
00:33:16,186 --> 00:33:19,605
Remember how I told you that
the cartel was making so much money

435
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:21,565
that they had to bury it?

436
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,859
And Blackbeard had the treasure map.

437
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,738
Well, after we got him,
he gave a lot of it up...

438
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,657
but not all of it.

439
00:33:29,658 --> 00:33:33,661
It just so happens that one day,
out in a field in Rionegro,

440
00:33:33,662 --> 00:33:38,373
a farmer who worked
for Galeano and Moncada found one.

441
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:41,044
At first, the poor guy
thought he'd dug up a body.

442
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:44,506
Over the years, plenty of 'em
had been buried out in the fields.

443
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:48,217
The farmer knew right away
it was narco money.

444
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:52,014
He was terrified he might
get buried himself if he took it.

445
00:33:52,222 --> 00:33:54,932
So he took the money
to a guy who was connected,

446
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:57,310
who took it to another guy...

447
00:33:57,311 --> 00:34:01,481
who took it to Pablo's
sicario lieutenant... Velasco.

448
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:05,194
(in Spanish)
There's cash buried everywhere.

449
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:10,240
The guerillas, the paramilitary,
the narcos...

450
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:13,910
- Everybody's burying cash.
- Yes, I know.

451
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,039
But right on Moncada
and Galeano's property?

452
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:21,251
Don't you think that's strange, boss?

453
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:24,129
I think it's strange.

454
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:56,202
(Pablo)
Look. All this cash...

455
00:34:56,203 --> 00:35:00,374
was found... in a field.

456
00:35:00,582 --> 00:35:02,959
- That's good luck, Pablo.
- (Moncada chuckles)

457
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,382
Or it could be bad luck.
For you both.

458
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:17,724
It was on your property,
in Rionegro.

459
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:21,435
But Pablo,
those lands are over 300 acres,

460
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:24,564
and most of us rent out to the farmers.

461
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:27,776
Mm.

462
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:34,407
You told me that you had
a 250-kilo shipment seized.

463
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:35,867
That's true.

464
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:38,245
The shipment equaled that amount of cash.

465
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:40,705
Who told you to open your mouth?

466
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:44,126
Not true? Hm?

467
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:48,421
Pablo, do you think
we're stealing from you?

468
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:51,340
That we made up that whole story
about the seizure?

469
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:54,385
If you'd like,
check with the cops in Boyacá.

470
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:58,765
Right, because cops in Boyacá
are so honest, right?

471
00:35:58,974 --> 00:36:00,933
(low chuckles)

472
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:03,937
Keep in mind that
we bought that property from Gustavo.

473
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:10,068
I even remember Gustavo saying
that you had cash stashed in every corner.

474
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:18,034
Gustavo...
would never forget where he buried cash.

475
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,790
Who's putting this shit
in your head, Pablo? These assholes?

476
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:26,251
These fuckers
would sell their own mother.

477
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,130
- We are partners and friends.
- Mm.

478
00:36:31,673 --> 00:36:36,261
Maybe that cash was lost
because I raised the tax?

479
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,513
Bullshit.
I paid the tax and never complained.

480
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:41,808
That's a lie.

481
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:47,855
- Because you complained to your wife.
- I haven't complained.

482
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:50,984
You have no idea
what I talk about with Judy.

483
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:53,861
(Galeano) I understand
this is difficult for you, Pablo--

484
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:55,447
What is difficult for me?

485
00:36:55,655 --> 00:36:59,241
Well, managing all of this.
That's why you hired us.

486
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:02,204
- So we can manage it and look after it.
- Mm.

487
00:37:05,332 --> 00:37:07,792
You trust us, right?

488
00:37:09,378 --> 00:37:11,003
I understand this makes you anxious--

489
00:37:11,004 --> 00:37:13,923
- Do I look anxious?
- No, I didn't mean that.

490
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:16,800
- You said with certainty that--
- No, no, what I meant to say was--

491
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:22,057
- I think you're the one who's anxious.
- We didn't do shit, Pablo!

492
00:37:24,017 --> 00:37:29,314
With that tone of yours...
you're telling me you didn't do shit?

493
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:35,404
Like I was some kind of idiot.
Is this my cash or not?!

494
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:36,611
No, Pablo.

495
00:37:36,612 --> 00:37:40,534
Did you take it and bury it
in Rionegro or not?!

496
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:42,577
For sure,
these guys hid your cash, boss.

497
00:37:42,785 --> 00:37:45,620
- It's the truth, you pair of liars.
- Of course, he--

498
00:37:45,621 --> 00:37:47,956
- Shut up, motherfucker!
- (Blackie) You're petty thieves!

499
00:37:47,957 --> 00:37:51,836
You shut up, motherfucker!
Don't you disrespect me!

500
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:58,510
Pablo, look at me, man.

501
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:02,638
We're family.

502
00:38:03,723 --> 00:38:07,601
You're my daughter's godfather.

503
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:10,897
And also godfather to Galeano's kids.

504
00:38:12,482 --> 00:38:13,649
What's going on?

505
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:21,616
We're like brothers.

506
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,204
We're partners and friends.

507
00:38:26,413 --> 00:38:29,457
We've been in this
our whole lives, Pablo.

508
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:33,127
We made our first trip to Miami together.

509
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:39,008
We made so much cash together that
we don't even know what we spent it on.

510
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:42,095
What's the problem?

511
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:45,223
What's happening?

512
00:38:48,184 --> 00:38:50,936
The two of us love you very much.

513
00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:53,148
And we're very grateful.

514
00:39:08,788 --> 00:39:10,332
(Pablo sighs)

515
00:39:15,003 --> 00:39:16,546
All right.

516
00:39:18,214 --> 00:39:20,967
Being stuck in here...

517
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,137
can make someone paranoid.

518
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,777
(groans)

519
00:39:40,736 --> 00:39:43,239
- Paisa! Paisa!
- (man laughs)

520
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:49,037
(Moncada) Well, man,
these things happen, right?

521
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,583
We're here for whatever you need.
Trust us.

522
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,668
I'm going to make a trip to Miami.

523
00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:58,672
I'll bring you a few little things
to keep you entertained, OK?

524
00:40:01,383 --> 00:40:02,717
Don Pablo.

525
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,036
(shouts)

526
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:32,913
- (impact thuds)
- (Galeano groaning)

527
00:40:32,914 --> 00:40:35,750
Pablo, don't do it! Pablo, no!

528
00:40:38,794 --> 00:40:41,297
(Moncada shouts indistinctly)

529
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:57,313
(breathing heavily)

530
00:40:59,815 --> 00:41:02,777
(Moncada) You're a dog,
you son of a bitch!

531
00:41:08,241 --> 00:41:12,454
What does it feel like
to take a shit on your own empire?

532
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:16,207
You want us to tell you
that we stole the money?

533
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,209
(spits)

534
00:41:20,587 --> 00:41:26,550
At the end of the day, you'll believe
whatever you want, motherfucker.

535
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,595
(panting)

536
00:41:38,271 --> 00:41:39,814
Goodbye, Kiko.

537
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,696
Kill me if you're such a man,
motherfucker. (groaning)

538
00:41:47,697 --> 00:41:50,031
Kill me with your own fucking hands!

539
00:41:50,032 --> 00:41:52,368
(Blackie)
Who are you talking to, asshole?

540
00:41:55,997 --> 00:41:58,040
Motherfucker!

541
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:07,383
(murmuring in Spanish)

542
00:42:08,384 --> 00:42:09,385
(groaning)

543
00:42:14,307 --> 00:42:15,767
(grunting)

544
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:18,227
(muttering in Spanish)

545
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:19,688
Wait a second!

546
00:42:19,895 --> 00:42:21,773
Be careful, man.

547
00:42:28,237 --> 00:42:30,865
Look what the dead guy gave me.

548
00:42:31,073 --> 00:42:34,160
- (up-tempo Latin music plays)
- (indistinct chatter in Spanish)

549
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:47,756
What the fuck!
You're going to burn all the meat!

550
00:42:47,757 --> 00:42:50,467
What is wrong with you? Can't you see
I'm doing it to cover the smell?

551
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:54,763
- Yeah, but let's not burn it all.
- What are we gonna do with all this meat?

552
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:57,725
- What are you going to do?
- What am I supposed to do?

553
00:42:57,726 --> 00:42:59,477
What?

554
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:01,436
(both laugh)

555
00:43:01,437 --> 00:43:02,814
(chatter continues indistinctly)

556
00:43:03,022 --> 00:43:05,274
(music continues outside, faint)

557
00:43:12,365 --> 00:43:14,534
Boss, are you OK?

558
00:43:16,118 --> 00:43:18,120
Do you need anything, boss?

559
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:23,084
We're grilling some meat.
Do you want some?

560
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,713
No. I'm not hungry.

561
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:55,658
Navegante.

562
00:43:56,618 --> 00:43:58,160
Boss.

563
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:02,623
- Do you want me to wax it?
- No, relax.

564
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:05,376
This one's my favorite.
I enjoy it.

565
00:44:06,168 --> 00:44:08,922
This is a beautiful car.

566
00:44:09,798 --> 00:44:12,467
Anything new on Galeano and Moncada?

567
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:18,013
(sighs)
Looks like the rumors are true, boss.

568
00:44:22,644 --> 00:44:24,395
It's a shame.

569
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,023
I warned them.

570
00:44:29,024 --> 00:44:32,027
As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.

571
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:41,994
Do you still have that DEA contact?

572
00:44:41,995 --> 00:44:45,666
Javier Peña? Of course.

573
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:48,628
I want you to contact him
and confirm the rumors.

574
00:44:48,837 --> 00:44:52,381
They're just as interested
in screwing Escobar as we are.

575
00:44:54,884 --> 00:44:57,261
(Judy)
I haven't heard from him since yesterday.

576
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:01,264
I've called everyone.
I'm so worried.

577
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:04,685
Pablo told me
that they left La Catedral.

578
00:45:04,686 --> 00:45:06,688
Just relax, sweetie.

579
00:45:07,563 --> 00:45:09,273
Your husband is fine.

580
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,694
No. No, thank you.

581
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:19,784
Maybe... they had to go
somewhere else urgently?

582
00:45:19,993 --> 00:45:21,744
Or maybe they left
without saying anything.

583
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:23,996
The way our men usually do.

584
00:45:23,997 --> 00:45:26,623
Yes, but it's a little strange,
don't you think?

585
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:31,043
Kiko was very clear that he had
a meeting with Pablo at La Catedral.

586
00:45:31,044 --> 00:45:32,630
He said he would be home later.

587
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:37,301
We're trying to have another baby.
I think I told you that.

588
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:42,180
No? We're trying to have another baby,
and the time is right,

589
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:45,600
so we had a very important date to keep.

590
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:49,731
Are you sure that Pablo
told you that Kiko left La Catedral?

591
00:45:53,234 --> 00:45:55,945
Are you telling me
that my husband is a liar?

592
00:45:57,279 --> 00:45:59,490
I want my husband back.

593
00:46:02,368 --> 00:46:06,622
If Pablo told Tata that they left...

594
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:09,000
it's because they left.

595
00:46:09,918 --> 00:46:15,213
Listen...
Pablo is your kids' godfather.

596
00:46:15,214 --> 00:46:17,592
He would never hurt them.

597
00:46:29,437 --> 00:46:32,273
(in English)
Let's talk about Don Pablo Escobar.

598
00:46:34,233 --> 00:46:36,778
There are rumors that
he killed Galeano and Moncada.

599
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,573
Where, in jail?

600
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:46,078
Yeah, yeah.
(murmurs indistinctly)

601
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,038
"In jail."

602
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:51,042
That doesn't make any sense.
They're partners.

603
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:57,255
Maybe there is not such thing as sense
with Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

604
00:46:57,256 --> 00:47:00,802
Bullshit. Where'd you get it?

605
00:47:01,803 --> 00:47:06,139
The relatives of the men he killed...
are up in arms.

606
00:47:06,348 --> 00:47:10,603
The poor fellows went in,
but they never got out.

607
00:47:13,606 --> 00:47:17,068
I want to ask you gentlemen
a serious question now.

608
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,863
How bad do you want Escobar?

609
00:47:21,948 --> 00:47:24,866
How far are you willing to go
in this matter?

610
00:47:24,867 --> 00:47:27,036
What are you proposing?

611
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:33,292
Well, we both have access to information
that could benefit the other.

612
00:47:33,501 --> 00:47:35,128
No.

613
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,462
No, we don't trade information.

614
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:39,464
- Just hold on a second.
- No.

615
00:47:39,465 --> 00:47:41,633
He's an informant, Javi.

616
00:47:41,634 --> 00:47:44,678
Whatever you got cookin', it stinks.
I don't want it.

617
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:47,765
Appreciate the tip. Let's go.

618
00:47:52,311 --> 00:47:55,106
Your partner here...

619
00:47:57,692 --> 00:48:00,028
may need some convincing now.

620
00:48:03,656 --> 00:48:09,328
Moncada and Galeano going
into La Catedral, last stamped 9:20.

621
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:14,416
(Javier)
Every return from this day forward...

622
00:48:17,086 --> 00:48:19,212
no Moncada, no Galeano.

623
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:30,558
(Steve) Personally, we couldn't have cared
less about a couple of dead narcos.

624
00:48:30,766 --> 00:48:34,187
It meant more chaos and confusion
in the Medellín cartel.

625
00:48:35,063 --> 00:48:38,982
But we wanted Escobar out of that
piece of shit excuse for a jail,

626
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:42,027
in a real prison, not a fortress...

627
00:48:42,028 --> 00:48:44,446
where his enemies could get payback.

628
00:48:45,698 --> 00:48:47,323
You sure?

629
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:51,204
We can either play politics
or we can do the job.

630
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,666
Well, we were never any good
at playing politics anyway.

631
00:48:57,459 --> 00:48:59,087
(Javier in Spanish) What do you think?

632
00:49:02,215 --> 00:49:03,632
(man sighs)

633
00:49:04,884 --> 00:49:07,762
(in Spanish)
These photos are worth looking into.

634
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:10,598
And believe me, I'm going to.

635
00:49:16,896 --> 00:49:20,608
(in English) If it's true, this is
gonna cause a shit storm, you know?

636
00:49:28,574 --> 00:49:30,534
- Be right back.
- Gracias.

637
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,247
Well... (sighs)

638
00:49:35,248 --> 00:49:37,166
Fuck President Gaviria.

639
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:39,085
Fuck Noonan.

640
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:41,336
Fuck La Catedral.

641
00:49:43,256 --> 00:49:45,216
(Steve) And fuck Pablo.

642
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:49,929
(up-tempo Latin music plays)
