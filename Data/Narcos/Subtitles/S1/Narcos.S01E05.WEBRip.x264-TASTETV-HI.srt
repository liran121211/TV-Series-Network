We get you a passport.

Well, we keep her in hiding

and get her immunity
in exchange for her testimony...

52

Are you gonna get us immunity?

Agent Peña claims to have an informant
that can testify to that effect,

63
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,834

[Noonan] What? Which narcos?

72
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:29,574
- Sounded like Pablo Escobar.
- [Javier] We're almost certain.

73

It was, uh... [clears throat]
It was hard to tell.

74
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,495
The... connection was bad.
They were calling from Panama.

75
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:36,414
- Panama?
- They know Galán's gonna win

76
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:38,458
and they know
that he'll support extradition,

77
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,377
and they're not gonna sit around
and await being sent back to the US.

78
00:05:41,544 --> 00:05:44,923
Ambassador, word is Manuel Noriega
is providing safe harbor for the narcos,

79
00:05:45,006 --> 00:05:47,717
and possibly shipping points
for their cocaine.

80
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,970
[Noonan] They're moving
their drug operations to Panama?

81
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:52,597
That's horseshit, Peña.
Excuse me, Ambassador.

82
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,517
On one hand, you're saying Escobar's
in bed with left-wing communists.

83
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:58,812
Now you're saying
he's in bed with Manuel Noriega.

84
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:01,397
You can't have it both ways, son.

85
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:06,111

fight communism all over Latin America

for the last two decades.

00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:11,783

<i>When Bush was head of the CIA,
Noriega pretended to be a commie hater</i>

92
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:30,426
<i>so the US would ignore the fact that he
was heavily involved as a drug trafficker.</i>

93
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,263
<i>When Noriega realized he could
make even more money shipping his drugs</i>

94

<i>by siding with communists,
he switched teams.</i>

95
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:41,980
<i>So, we invaded Panama,
and arrested "Old Pineapple Face."</i>

96
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:44,649
<i>But, that was later.</i>

97
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:48,820
<i>For now, the trusted friend and ally
was a right-wing CIA asset</i>

98

and right from the narcos.</i>

You didn't tell us shit,
and you killed him, you son of a bitch.

168
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,336
- I want to go home, Fabio.
- Home?

169
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:40,963
Why are we going home?
So they can capture us?

170
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:47,220
All this shit you talk about partnership,
and then you do this on your own? Huh?

171
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:56,020
Galán was the only threat.

172
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,815
There is no one left to challenge us.

173
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:01,359
And you know why, Fabio.

174
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:05,363
Because no one
has the balls that we have.

175
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:10,284
- [sniffs]
- Going home.

176
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:16,040

[bell tolling]

179
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:24,298
[man speaking Spanish]
...that unique honesty.

180
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:27,468
As the people now rise
and call for justice,

181
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:31,556
I pray to God
that this sacrifice will serve at last...

182
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:37,520
as motivation for society
to react and bond...

183
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:42,942
to support the government...
and institutions...

184
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:47,696

a more effective leadership,

the hijackings,

186
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:55,413
or any other manifestations of violence.

187
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:58,583
My father, Luis Carlos Galán,

188
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,918
will be remembered
for awakening the Colombian people

189
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:04,130
to the danger of the narcos.

190
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:10,344
The assassin's bullets...
will not stop what my father began.

191
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:15,433
As he fell,
another rises in his place.

192
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:19,395
I want to tell Dr. César Gaviria...

193
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:23,483
in the name of the people of Colombia,
and my family...

194
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:29,196
that we entrust my father's ideals to him,
and that he can count on our support...

195
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:33,451
to become the president
Colombia wants and needs.

196
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:39,957
Dr. César Gaviria, save Colombia!

extradition, the narcos would declare war.</i>

202
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:04,565

the country would become a narco state.</i>

204
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:14,950
[wife speaking Spanish]
Phone!

205
00:15:16,827 --> 00:15:19,246
Let it go to the answering machine.

206
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:27,338
- The machine's full.
- [machine clicks, beeps]

207
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:29,590
I wish it would stop ringing.

208
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:33,135
It's your friends.
They're calling to offer support.

209
00:15:34,845 --> 00:15:38,224
Or opinions about what I should do.

210
00:15:40,226 --> 00:15:42,645
Why can't you run
without backing extradition?

211
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,778
- I wrote those speeches.
- Yes...

212
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:53,531
but do you even believe in them?

213
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:59,119
I don't know what I believe.

214
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:03,541
I don't want the narcos having free reign.

215
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:08,755
But I don't want the United States
involved in our affairs.

216
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:11,549
So say nothing.

217
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:15,678
That's the best way to stay alive.

218
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:22,268
[airplane soaring]

[Pablo] Gentlemen.

221
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:37,617
Fernando, cheer up. Have a drink.

222
00:16:37,784 --> 00:16:39,577
We're going home!

223
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:46,917
- How are you? Hm?
- Fine, my love.

224
00:16:48,836 --> 00:16:50,421
What about you?

225
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:51,547
Give me one.

226
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,050
Margarita, right?

227
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:57,094
Let's see.

228
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:01,265
- Son of a bitch, that's good.
- Right?

229
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:05,144
Thank you.
Listen, I've got a question for you.

230
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:07,438
[softly] Why are we going back?

231
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:10,817
We're walking into a world of shit.

232
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:14,027
Relax, brother.

233
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:18,616
Spain's too far away
to protect our interests.

234
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,202
We have a better chance
of influencing Pablo at home.

235
00:17:22,286 --> 00:17:27,583
We need to be close by.
Relax. [chuckles]

236
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,794
Don't you get it?

237
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:35,048
[sniffs] He's only comfortable at war.

238
00:17:35,257 --> 00:17:37,551
He's taking us to the slaughter.

239
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:44,892
[Gacha chatters indistinctly in Spanish]

240
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,247
How's business?

241
00:18:07,331 --> 00:18:12,879
Fucking Noriega is charging us a fortune,
but we got 175 tons to Miami.

242
00:18:13,671 --> 00:18:17,257
Gacha's Mexican routes
are opening up Los Angeles.

243
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,888
But do you know what matters most
for our business, Pablo?

244
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:26,809
That the situation at home stays calm.
Know what I mean?

245
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:28,143
Sure.

246
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:45,703
[softly] You should have
consulted with me about Galán.

247
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:49,916
You would have tried to talk me out of it.

248
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,375
Yes.

249
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:55,045
I would have tried.

250
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:00,760
The amount of money we are losing
is because of that bullshit.

251
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,765
Are you listening?

252
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:09,017
Look at those peaks, Gustavo.

253
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:18,986
I'll die...
before I ever leave Colombia again.

254
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:26,452
[phone ringing]

255
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:28,120
[in Spanish]
What's happening, Carrillo?

256
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:29,496
[in English]
Thank you for coming.

257
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,248
I understand the narcos
are back from Panama.

258
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:33,125
[in Spanish]
So you practice your English with me?

259
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,711
[in English] Because these men
aren't cleared, and if we speak Spanish,

260
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:37,212
it could get back to Pablo.

261
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:42,009
So I started this to monitor
Pablo's <i>sicarios' </i>communications.

262
00:19:42,092 --> 00:19:44,678
SAT phones, landlines, you name it.

263
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:46,096
I've got dozens of wiretaps,

264
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:49,141
but I've only managed to seize
about ten kilos in the last month.

265
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:52,352
Probably because I've listened
to my own men tipping the narcos off.

266
00:19:52,436 --> 00:19:53,854
So I've had to start surveilling them.

267
00:19:54,772 --> 00:19:57,399
I listen to them
tell their girlfriends they're afraid...

268
00:19:57,483 --> 00:20:00,068
cry to their mothers
when one of our men gets shot down.

269
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:04,490
But every once in a while...
I hear them trade secrets with Pablo.

270
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:07,868
Do your bosses know you're doing this?

271
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:10,162
I trust them even less.

272
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:12,790
Most of my men are from here,

273
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:16,168
where they can get to your mother,
your aunt, your cousin.

274
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:21,632
How do I fight... when my soldiers
are already working for Escobar?

275
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:25,177
Well, do they have to be from Medellín?

276
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:34,561
[speaking Spanish] Yes.

277
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:36,730
I definitely like the red one best.

278
00:20:37,564 --> 00:20:39,984
- Really?
- Mm.

279
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,485
I prefer the gray.

280
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:45,238
Red is the color of the party,

281
00:20:45,322 --> 00:20:49,117
and it makes you more...
sociable and close to the people.

282
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:52,287
- That's important.
- Mm.

283
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:54,081
[sighs]

284
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:56,625
I wonder what Luis Carlos
would have chosen?

285
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:01,547
You know, we should
also hire an image consultant.

286
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:08,345
We have to make you more appealing
to the youth, give you a more modern look.

287
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:10,430
Now you are going to give me image advice?

288
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:12,349
I'm just thinking about the polls.

289
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,352
Anyway...

290
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:22,192
Galán had professionals at his side,
but which could he trust?

291
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:24,070
Hm?

292
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:27,531
And you know perfectly well
that you can trust me, right?

293
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:29,075
Mm-hm.

294
00:21:30,993 --> 00:21:33,871
Well, what are you going to choose,
red or gray?

295
00:21:37,374 --> 00:21:38,792
[sighs]

296
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:45,424
Luis Carlos said something to me
before he died.

297
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,802
"There will be a future."

298
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:54,516
Now let's see what kind of future it is.

299
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:03,191
[Duque]
We worked together in the ministry.

300
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:05,694
The idea that
he's a presidential candidate

301
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:08,072
shows you our sad state of affairs.

302
00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:11,658
I need to know which side he is on.

303
00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:15,788
He speaks with
the Foreign Press next week.

304
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:17,831
They'll certainly ask his position.

305
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:20,626
Don't worry, Pablo.
He'll be easy to influence.

306
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,128
- No, I disagree.
- Why?

307
00:22:22,335 --> 00:22:26,006
I did an interview with him once,
when he was an economic advisor.

308
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,593
I found him sitting in the parking lot
in his beat-up Renault,

309
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:35,141
eating a bag of apples...
and reading economic reform textbooks.

310
00:22:35,348 --> 00:22:38,018
He was testifying to the cabinet
and wanted to be ready.

311
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:41,438
He's a bookworm, not a leader.

312
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:43,816
- No... No...
- No, no, no, you're missing my point.

313
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:45,859
- No.
- He's not an oligarch.

314
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:48,946
He's from modest circumstances.

315
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:50,948
Like you,
he's worked for everything he has.

316
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:54,409
You have to be careful
with people like that.

317
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:05,838
[voice straining]
I want you to deliver a message.

318
00:23:07,214 --> 00:23:09,299
[Jorge] We've made a lot of money.

319
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:14,847
What we have to decide is do we stick
with Pablo... or chart our own course?

320
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:17,766
[horses whinnying]

321
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,144
We should talk to our friends down south.

322
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,815
No, no. It's not time. No. Mm?

323
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:27,693
- Whatever you say.
- [chuckles]

324
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:29,361
Have you seen Marina?

325
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:31,030
She told me she was
going to buy a new brush.

326
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:33,866
You know your sister.

327
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:38,245
- Her shopping expeditions take weeks.
- [both laughing]

328
00:23:38,453 --> 00:23:40,747
[up-tempo Latin song plays]

329
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:47,004
You have no idea how much
I wanted to go down on you in Panama.

330
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:48,421
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

331
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:51,925
I could tell that you really wanted to.

332
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:54,511
- Come here, baby.
- You are very patient.

333
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:55,888
Yes, of course.

334
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:59,850
All your people were there,
your brothers...

335
00:24:00,475 --> 00:24:02,186

- What?

- They can go fuck themselves.
- [laughs]

342
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:20,120
If they want to,
they can go live in Spain...

343
00:24:20,204 --> 00:24:23,040
- [both grunting]
- ...but you're staying here with me.

344
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:32,258
Let's not hide anymore.

345

- Not anymore.
- [moaning]

346
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:37,596
All right.

- What do we do about my wife?
- [both grunting]

348
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:47,355
Ask Pablo to do us a favor.

349
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,027
Just like he took care of Galán,
he can take care of your wife.

You've moved up, Fernando.

355

From government minister
to Pablo Escobar's errand boy.

356
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:23,934
I guess the pay is much better.

357
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:26,603
I'm not doing this for the money.

358
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:32,234
What country sends its own citizens
to an iron tomb in the United States?

359
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:34,820
I understand your dilemma.

360
00:25:34,903 --> 00:25:40,784
Speak out in favor, you're seen as a US
puppet and you might not win the election.

361
00:25:41,827 --> 00:25:45,289
Speak out against,
you anger the US...

362

as a shill of the narcos.

363
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:52,921
César, I was thinking I would love
to dedicate a program for your campaign.

364
00:25:53,088 --> 00:25:56,842
It would be an honor for me,
and would benefit us both.

365
00:25:58,885 --> 00:26:00,304
What a great idea.

366
00:26:01,138 --> 00:26:03,807
You guys are really shameless,
aren't you?

367
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:08,770
- How do you sleep at night?
- César, it doesn't have to be this way.

368
00:26:08,937 --> 00:26:12,691
If Luis had been as smart as you,

369
00:26:12,774 --> 00:26:14,901
perhaps we could have avoided
this horrible tragedy.

370
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:18,822
We could have had peace.

371
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:20,240
Easy.

372

374
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,669
Maybe you will have a future.

that commie priest, Father Sobrino.

379
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:52,314
He's gonna talk. And when he does,
I hope you DEA boys understand

380
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:54,066
what's important in this hemisphere.

381
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:57,569
Well, how about you, uh...
clue us in?

382
00:26:57,652 --> 00:27:01,156
Drug dealers, I mean, bad as they are,
they want your money.

383
00:27:01,948 --> 00:27:03,283
Communists want everything.

384
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:08,788
I don't know about you, Peña, but I...
I like to own shit.

385
00:27:08,997 --> 00:27:10,249
Right.

386
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:12,918
Good talk, Lou.

387
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:16,004
- Very, uh... enlightening.
- Yeah.

388
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:18,173
Oh...

389
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,178
This... priest?

390
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:27,515
If it comes out that he was your informant
and you protected him...

391
00:27:28,641 --> 00:27:30,310
I'm gonna make sure
you're tried for treason.

392
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:39,986
[Steve] <i>Peña had to figure out</i>
<i>how to get fake papers for Elisa.</i>

393
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:42,864
<i>So he did what he does best.</i>

394
00:27:43,073 --> 00:27:46,034
Let me guess: it's a very
sad and complicated situation

395
00:27:46,118 --> 00:27:47,660
involving you and a beautiful local.

396
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:51,498
You got your nails done.
It's... It's your color, Colleen.

397
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:54,293
- What do you want, Javier?
- It's simple.

398
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,836
I just need your signature...
right there.

399
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,340
You want me to create an embassy ID?

400
00:28:00,424 --> 00:28:02,217
- Who is this woman?
- What I want you to do

401
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:05,262
is sidestep a little bullshit bureaucracy
and help someone stay alive.

402
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:09,557
You really think I'd be asking you
if it wasn't important?

403
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:11,351
She's my informant.

404
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:13,853
And she could be the key to bringing down
the whole Medellín cartel,

405
00:28:13,937 --> 00:28:16,064
so come on, Colleen,
whose side are you on?

406
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:34,374
[speaking Spanish]
Cousin, what happened?

407
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:36,751
Where were you?

408
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,546
- In the office.
- In the office?

409
00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:40,755
Yes.

410
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:43,383
Is that where you were?

411
00:28:46,636 --> 00:28:48,138
That's weird...

412
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:52,434
because I called
and they said you hadn't been in all day.

413
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:56,396
I don't know which office you called,
but I was there.

414
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,982
They're seizing everything, Pablo.
All the accounts...

415
00:28:59,065 --> 00:29:01,609
We knew there would
be a reaction with Galán, right?

416
00:29:01,818 --> 00:29:03,695
Yeah.

417
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:05,655
Relax, Gustavo.

418
00:29:07,115 --> 00:29:09,909
Relax, because everything
will calm down later.

[fuse hissing]

420
00:29:19,878 --> 00:29:22,714
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna kill us both?

421
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:25,925
- You afraid to die?
- No. Are you?

422
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:36,686
- Put it out.
- Where were you?

423
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:38,605
Put it out, Pablo.

424
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,567
Put it out, Pablo!

425
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:51,826
Are you with me or what?

426
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:56,498
And when have I not been with you?

427
00:30:00,544 --> 00:30:03,505
From the beginning,
it has been you and me.

428
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:08,927
I cannot do this without you.

429
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:15,725
Are you doubting my loyalty, Pablo?

430
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,938
No.

431
00:30:22,941 --> 00:30:26,653

about the Ochoas.

00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:19,696
Carrillo's a cop.
You can always buy a cop with money.

507
00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:23,241
- I've tried, believe me.
- Then offer more.

508
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:28,788
Or I can loan you Navegante.
He will do whatever I ask.

509
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,877
[voice strains] That's true.

510
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:40,174
It's silver or lead.
That's the choice for that bastard.

511
00:35:40,258 --> 00:35:45,263
Speaking of lead,
I'm getting a shipment of weapons in.

512
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:47,181
Uzis, grenades...

513
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:53,187
If I could find a nuclear weapon...
But now I'm negotiating a fucking missile.

514
00:35:53,271 --> 00:35:56,357
- A missile? No fucking way.
- Yes.

515
00:35:56,441 --> 00:35:57,734
- Boss.
- Eh?

516
00:35:57,817 --> 00:36:01,237
[President Bush] <i>This is crack cocaine,</i>
<i>seized a few days ago</i>

517
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,489
<i>by drug enforcement agents,</i>

518
00:36:03,573 --> 00:36:06,785
<i>in a park just across the street
from the White House.</i>

519
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:10,246
<i>And our message
to the drug cartels is this:</i>

520
00:36:10,455 --> 00:36:11,957
<i>the rules have changed.</i>

521
00:36:12,123 --> 00:36:14,333
- [Bush continues indistinctly]
- He's bullshitting, right?

522
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,713
He's smoking that shit.
I guarantee it.

523
00:36:19,965 --> 00:36:21,215
[sighs]

524
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:23,509
[Gacha] Motherfucker.

525
00:36:25,678 --> 00:36:27,680
Mm...

526
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:36,689
Mrs. Quiroga told me
the neighbors on the block took a vote.

527
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:38,065
They want us to move.

528
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:42,654
But we have guards stationed
outside the house 24 hours a day.

529
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:44,280
That's what scares them.

530
00:36:47,826 --> 00:36:49,327
Come here.

531
00:36:51,245 --> 00:36:53,790
It won't always be like this,
my love.

532
00:36:53,873 --> 00:36:55,792
[knocking at door]

533
00:37:06,011 --> 00:37:07,470
[cocks gun]

534
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:20,274
- Rodrigo.
- Hello, Horacio.

535
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:22,276
- Everything OK?
- May I speak with you?

536
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,945
Yes, sure. Come in, come in.

537
00:37:25,738 --> 00:37:27,532
[Rodrigo]
<i>Let's talk about the incorruptibles.</i>

538
00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:30,702
I'm listening.

539
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:37,959
[sighs]

540
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:42,088
I've been instructed to tell you that
if you cease and desist your operations,

541
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:45,675
you will receive
a one-time payment of six million.

542
00:37:46,885 --> 00:37:49,512
Horacio... that's US dollars,
not pesos.

543
00:37:52,264 --> 00:37:53,933
Instructed by whom?

544
00:37:55,894 --> 00:37:57,812
I think you can guess.

545
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:01,148
Say the name.

546
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:02,984
You know who.

547
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:05,653
Say the name, Rodrigo.

548
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:09,198
[sighs]

549
00:38:10,408 --> 00:38:11,617
Escobar.

550
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:21,252
Don't look at me like that, Horacio.
I've always cared for you.

551
00:38:21,335 --> 00:38:25,715
I'm making this suggestion to save
you and your family from terrible grief.

552
00:38:28,134 --> 00:38:30,219
[sighs] This man has tentacles.

553
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:33,139
I'm surprised
he hasn't killed you already.

554
00:38:35,058 --> 00:38:36,183
Get out.

555
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:40,063
Horacio, please...

556
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:49,697
Horacio...

557
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:55,745
[sighs]

558
00:38:58,456 --> 00:38:59,707
Take care.

559
00:39:03,252 --> 00:39:06,297
[door opens, closes]

560
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:09,926
[Javier in English]
I was driving to the church.

561
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:12,762
Was with my buddy, John.
He was my best man.

562
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:16,849
- We were late. [sighs]
- [thunder rumbling]

563
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:19,978
It was fucking blazing outside,
110 degrees.

564
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:23,230
Whole bridal party was there
sweating their balls off, I'm sure.

565
00:39:24,816 --> 00:39:28,069
- And all of a sudden, I stopped the car.
- [soft chuckle]

566
00:39:28,153 --> 00:39:30,196
Please don't tell me
you left her at the altar.

567
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:32,991
I don't know if she actually
made it to the altar.

568
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,742
[laughing]

569
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:39,246
Well, you saved her
a lifetime of hell.

570
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:43,001
Yeah, she forgave me. Eventually.

571
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:46,587
- Married a stockbroker from Dallas.
- Hm.

572
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:49,548
Randy... I think.

573
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:55,221
Trust me, she's better off.

574
00:39:58,683 --> 00:40:01,686
[sighs]
What if Father Sobrino talks?

575
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:05,106
He's gonna talk.

576
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:09,485
[Steve sighs]

577
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:37,429
[Javier speaking Spanish]
It's about time, Navegante.

578
00:40:39,348 --> 00:40:40,850
[sighs]

579
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:44,812
[speaking broken English]
Sorry I'm late. I couldn't came before.

580
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:46,898
[Javier]
What do you got?

581
00:40:48,274 --> 00:40:50,317
Gacha's going tonight to Cartagena.

582
00:40:54,947 --> 00:40:56,699
I can help you get him.

583
00:40:56,782 --> 00:40:59,368
You said you had information.
You didn't say Gacha.

584
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,872
I guess is your lucky day.

585
00:41:10,129 --> 00:41:12,631
- What's the informant's motivation?
- Could be money.

586
00:41:12,798 --> 00:41:16,177
The reward for Gacha is one million US.
I'd say that's pretty good motivation.

587
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:19,097
He spends his life on the run
if we don't catch him.

588
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,100
- Something else going on with this guy.
- It's worth taking a risk.

589
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,523
Peña, you go to Cartagena.
Solely in an observational capacity.

590
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:33,236
We want this man captured alive,
if possible.

591
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:34,653
Murphy stays here in Bogotá.

592
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:37,115
Gaviria's press conference is tonight,

593
00:41:37,198 --> 00:41:41,035
and I wanna be sure whatever
he plans to say, he gets to say it.

594
00:41:43,288 --> 00:41:44,789
Yes, ma'am.
[clearing throat]

595
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:47,166
That's a beautiful dress,
Ambassador Noonan.

596
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:49,210
[door opening]

597
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:52,338
- [Lou] Come on, Father. Ah, yeah. Talk!
- [Sobrino grunting]

598
00:41:52,504 --> 00:41:55,174
[muffled groaning]

599
00:41:55,258 --> 00:41:58,010
- [Lou] Huh?
- [struggling grunts]

600
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:03,975
- [sputtering]
- [Lou] Huh?

601
00:42:04,183 --> 00:42:07,228
[panting] More? You want more?

602
00:42:07,312 --> 00:42:10,689
No! No more, please! No more!

603
00:42:10,773 --> 00:42:12,900
[sobbing] No more!

604
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:15,486
Ah, he's all yours.
He's ready to talk.

605
00:42:16,445 --> 00:42:17,613
Father...

606
00:42:19,115 --> 00:42:21,993
how did Elisa Alvaro get away?

607
00:42:22,827 --> 00:42:24,495
[gasping]

608
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:25,913
[speaking Spanish]

609
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,504
- [Sobrino sobbing]
- She left with the American woman.

610
00:42:35,547 --> 00:42:38,550
- [sighs]
- Murphy's wife.

611
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:44,140
I just don't understand.
How'd you get involved with communists?

612
00:42:44,223 --> 00:42:46,225
Have you actually met a communist?

613
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:48,686
Yeah, I have, actually...
and she lied to me.

614
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:50,604
Well, I'm not a communist, Connie.

615
00:42:50,813 --> 00:42:54,233
I'm fighting against poverty,
corruption, injustice and greed.

616
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:56,944
But I guess Americans
don't have the same problem.

617
00:42:57,028 --> 00:42:58,321
Don't we?

618
00:42:58,404 --> 00:42:59,947
It's not the same.

619
00:43:00,031 --> 00:43:02,283
Look, I just wish
you'd been straight with me.

620
00:43:03,742 --> 00:43:04,994
I'm sorry.

621
00:43:05,703 --> 00:43:07,038
Perhaps I should go.

622
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:12,043
You can't just go.
Look, if they find you, they'll kill you.

623
00:43:13,878 --> 00:43:17,048
I fell in love with a man...
with a good man.

624
00:43:17,131 --> 00:43:19,717
And I was hoping
to do something good.

625
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,722
But instead, I fell into something...
else, something more violent.

626
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:28,642
Yeah, that makes two of us.

627
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:33,064
[Steve murmurs indistinctly]

628
00:43:34,732 --> 00:43:36,025
I'll see you when I get home.

629
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:43,782
Here, Elisa's ID.

630
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:46,952
- What am I supposed to do with that?
- Take her to Cumaral.

631
00:43:47,036 --> 00:43:48,537
My contact there agreed to hide her.

632
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,039
[scoffs] While you go to Cartagena?

633
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:52,250
[mutters] I can't believe this shit.

634
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:55,044
- Who made this?
- Brother, what do you suggest we do?

635
00:43:55,127 --> 00:43:56,587
Jump out of a window?

636
00:43:59,048 --> 00:44:00,341
Look, she's...

637
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:04,845
- She's important.
- To who?

638
00:44:05,804 --> 00:44:07,098
To us.

639
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:12,561
[sighs]

640
00:44:14,605 --> 00:44:19,277
I take care of Elisa...
you better fucking get Gacha.

641
00:44:25,616 --> 00:44:26,825
[wife chuckles]

642
00:44:27,701 --> 00:44:29,703
[speaking Spanish]
Finally, a romantic date.

643
00:44:30,704 --> 00:44:32,331
It's been a long time
since we've been alone.

644
00:44:32,415 --> 00:44:37,920
Mm. Just you, me...
and our bodyguard.

645
00:44:38,003 --> 00:44:40,756
[chuckles]

646
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:44,551
Like the old days when we were young
and your father watched us.

647
00:44:44,635 --> 00:44:48,139
- Mm. My father adored you.
- [softly] Yeah, right.

648
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:51,016
- [chuckles]
- [motorcycle idles outside]

649
00:44:56,147 --> 00:44:58,357
- [automatic gunfire]
- [patrons screaming]

650
00:45:01,152 --> 00:45:02,111
[grunts]

651
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:07,074
[groans]

652
00:45:07,992 --> 00:45:10,119
- Garcia...
- [chaotic chatter in Spanish]

653
00:45:11,662 --> 00:45:13,789
[panting]

654
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:16,750
[phone ringing]

655
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:27,678
Hello? Yes.

656
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:33,309
Yes.

657
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:37,688
But he's all right?

658
00:45:40,691 --> 00:45:42,026
All right.

659
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:50,576
[exhaling]

660
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:56,582
[soft clattering]

661
00:45:58,584 --> 00:46:00,378
Ana?

662
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:02,505
[clattering continues]

663
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:12,515
Ana?

664
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:23,025
Ana?

665
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:28,406
Ana!

666
00:46:31,576 --> 00:46:35,871
- A little bird... came into the house.
- [chirping]

667
00:46:35,954 --> 00:46:37,582
I'm helping it out.

668
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:50,010
What?

669
00:46:55,307 --> 00:46:57,351
There was an assassination attempt...

670
00:46:59,437 --> 00:47:01,897
on Colonel Carrillo.

671
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,274
Did someone die?

672
00:47:04,483 --> 00:47:06,902
[sighs] One of his men.

673
00:47:08,987 --> 00:47:11,240
- [thunder rumbling]
- It must be terrible,

674
00:47:11,323 --> 00:47:13,534
the position you're in.

675
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:16,912
I want you to know
I think you are very brave.

676
00:47:19,748 --> 00:47:23,502
I'm not brave. Not like Galán.

677
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:26,797
That fear keeps you alive.

678
00:47:28,382 --> 00:47:30,926
That's what none of them understand.

679
00:47:34,763 --> 00:47:38,309
I will support any decision you make.

680
00:47:45,732 --> 00:47:49,528
[Steve] <i>It's been said that</i>
<i>nothing gives the fearful more courage...</i>

681
00:47:50,404 --> 00:47:52,448
<i>than another's fear.</i>

682
00:47:52,657 --> 00:47:54,866
[audience murmuring]

683
00:47:55,826 --> 00:48:01,081
<i>Luis Carlos Galán
had made a decision that cost his life.</i>

684
00:48:01,165 --> 00:48:03,000
[approaching footsteps]

685
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,003
<i>And now, it was Gaviria's turn.</i>

686
00:48:06,962 --> 00:48:08,046
[feedback]

687
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,133
[speaking English]
Welcome, American press.

688
00:48:11,216 --> 00:48:14,219
Tonight, I have the great pleasure

689
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:18,307
of introducing candidate César Gaviria.

690
00:48:29,485 --> 00:48:33,155
- [clears throat]
- [camera shutters clicking]

691
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:42,206
[speaking English] It has long been
our government's policy...

692
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:49,838
to deal with every man equally...
in the eyes of the law.

693
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:53,217
So...

694
00:49:01,266 --> 00:49:04,061
- [hushed whispers]
- [sighs]

695
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:12,152
[soft chuckle]

696
00:49:13,696 --> 00:49:15,239
Colombians say...

697
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:19,702
God made our land so beautiful...

698
00:49:20,786 --> 00:49:23,288
it was unfair to the rest of the world.

699
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,167
So to even the score...

700
00:49:28,669 --> 00:49:34,258
God populated the land...
with a race of evil men.

701
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:42,683
[Gaviria on TV] <i>The primary impediment</i>
<i>to a free and uninhibited future</i>

702
00:49:42,891 --> 00:49:48,731
<i>is the violence and terror
that currently grips our beloved country.</i>

703
00:49:50,148 --> 00:49:54,903
A violence initiated by these evil men...

704
00:49:55,987 --> 00:49:58,407
will be brought to justice...

705
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:02,994
in the name of decency...

706
00:50:05,581 --> 00:50:08,083
and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán.

707
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:10,711
<i>We will extradite.</i>

708
00:50:11,462 --> 00:50:15,966
<i>This decision...
will not come from fear.</i>

709
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:20,887
It has come from a clarity of judgment...

710
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:25,768
free from the cloud of terror
that surrounds us

711
00:50:25,851 --> 00:50:27,311
and obscures our view.

712
00:50:29,938 --> 00:50:34,443
I can say only one thing to Colombians
in these times of peril:

713
00:50:38,864 --> 00:50:41,492
There will be a future.

714
00:50:46,705 --> 00:50:49,541
- Thank you.
- [applause]

715
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,169

[men cheering]

718
00:51:40,008 --> 00:51:41,259
[Pablo]<i> Hello?</i>

719
00:51:42,427 --> 00:51:44,680
[speaking Spanish]
You think you're hot shit?

720
00:51:44,763 --> 00:51:47,140
You should change your satellite phone.

721
00:51:49,017 --> 00:51:50,435
Who is this?

722
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:54,105
<i>Your mother's in Rionegro
with that tub of lard you call your son.</i>

723
00:51:55,232 --> 00:51:58,527
<i>And your wife was at Carrera 11 today,
shopping for clothes.</i>

724
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,655
You bastard son of a bitch,
you think that...

725
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:04,575
What, you think because you're a cop
I'm afraid of you or something?

726
00:52:04,658 --> 00:52:07,912
<i>You know where my family is, fag,
well, I know where yours is, too.</i>

727
00:52:07,994 --> 00:52:09,996
<i>- Don't forget that.</i>
- Gonorrhea bastard son of a bitch.

728
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,249
Why don't you take money
like everyone else?

729
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:15,085
I could have had you living like a king.
But now, guess what?

730
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:20,591
Time to kill your dad, your mom,
your kids, your entire family,

731
00:52:20,674 --> 00:52:22,885
and you should be smart enough to realize

732
00:52:22,968 --> 00:52:27,472
I have each and every one of them
under watch, you fucking bastard.

733
00:52:27,556 --> 00:52:30,058
<i>Not everyone's for sale, Pablo.</i>

734
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:32,978
<i>You just keep hiding,
and I will find you.</i>

735
00:52:33,061 --> 00:52:34,438
<i>Don't know when...</i>

736
00:52:34,646 --> 00:52:36,440
but I will find you.

737
00:52:37,232 --> 00:52:38,901
And when I find you...

738
00:52:39,902 --> 00:52:41,695
- I'm going to kill you.
- <i>I'm going to kill you</i>

739
00:52:41,779 --> 00:52:44,197
and your entire family,
you son of a bitch!

740
00:52:44,281 --> 00:52:45,783

742
