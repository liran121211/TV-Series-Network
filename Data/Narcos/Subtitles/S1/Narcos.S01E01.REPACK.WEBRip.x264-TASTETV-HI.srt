[Latin guitar music playing]

6
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:40,723
[male narrator] Nowadays, the US
government can listen to anything you say.

7
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:44,143
They know where you are,
they know who you're talking to,

8
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:47,605
and trust me,
they know who you're fucking.

9
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:51,442
You turn on a cell phone or a computer,
and you're doomed.

10
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:56,656
But in Colombia in 1989,
it wasn't that easy.

11
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:58,950
First off,
there was no Internet.

12
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:00,451
No cells.

13
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,203
The best they had were satellite phones,

14
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:06,541
and in order to capture a satellite phone,
you had to fly directly over it.

15
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:10,920
On top of that, the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...

16
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,381
the landowners, the politicians...

17
00:01:14,757 --> 00:01:18,469
And lucky for us,
the narcos were richer than them all.

18
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:21,305
[phone squeaking]

19
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:24,225
[man speaking Spanish]
What's up, Lizard?

20
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:27,603
We're going out tonight.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,944
[narrator] And once you got a signal,
you didn't know who you were listening to.

22
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,614
That's why back then, the US government
developed software that could identify

23
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,158
- the voices of our targets.
- [indistinct chatter on headphones]

24
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:45,371
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz,
gentlemen.

25
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:48,499
And you guessed it:
no GPS either.

26
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,960
Hammer, prepare to engage.

27
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:54,463
[narrator] Once we got a target,
we still had to locate it.

28
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,300
So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

29
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,720
[chatter in Spanish over headphones]

30
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:04,057
OK, he's in Modelia.
He's on the west side.

31
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,308
Hawkeye, how do you copy that?

32
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,938
[man over radio] Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.

33
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:12,189
[in Spanish]
La Dispensaria.

34
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:14,859
I've got a table ready.

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,487
Show up around midnight.

36
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,616
- It's gonna be raining women.
- [narrator] Poison didn't know it,

37
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,910
but he'd just made himself a date.

38
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:27,914
Negative on Hammer. This fuckwad
just told us where he's going.

39
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:29,874
Hammer, disengage.

40
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,251
So who do we give this to? DEA?

41
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:35,838
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

42
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,007
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

43
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:40,384
[baby crying]

44
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:42,470
[narrator]
By "the other guy," he meant me.

45
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:45,723
I'm Steve Murphy,
Drug Enforcement Agent.

46
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:50,352
And as you can see,
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.

47
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,479
Hello?

48
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,023
[man] Poison will be partying
at La Dispensaria.

49
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:54,941
Got it.

50
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,652
He's meeting Lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.

51
00:02:57,735 --> 00:02:59,070
OK.

52
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:01,739
[Steve] I would've loved
to go after Poison myself,

53
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:05,160
but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.

54
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:09,246
So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.

55
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,498
Hola.

56
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:14,251
- [up-tempo Latin music playing]
- [in Spanish] La Dispensaria?

57
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:15,377
All right.

58
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,381
Guess who that was.

59
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:21,717
Your partner.

60
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,512
He just gave me a great gift.

61
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:26,973
Poison.

62
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,063
Does he know
how I'm going to package it?

63
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,315
Yeah, sure.

64
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:38,526
He's not a fool.

65
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,820
Gotta go.

66
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:44,907
Gonna stick me with the bill?

67
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,455
Cheap son of a bitch.

68
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,167
[Steve] In case you're wondering,
this is the asshole.

69
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,128
Javier Peña, my partner.

70
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:00,715
And this is Colonel Carrillo,
the leader of the Search Bloc,

71
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:03,759
the unit we helped create
to capture the bad guys.

72
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,637
Boy, did he have
a lot of love for the narcos.

73
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,932
- [motorcycles rumbling]
- [up-tempo Latin music playing]

74
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:14,436
[Steve] Party time in Zona Rosa.
Everybody goes there.

75
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,355
Especially the local hitmen.

76
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,191
Colombians call them sicarios.

77
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:21,027
- [in Spanish] What's up, son?
- Hey, brother.

78
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:24,530
- Let's go inside and have a good time.
- [horn honks]

79
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:26,615
[Steve]
Now, Poison, he was one of the best.

80
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:30,619
Crazy motherfucker
who killed dozens of people.

81
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,163
Probably hundreds.

82
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,040
But don't get me wrong.

83
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:37,376
I would've sent Carrillo there
even if Poison never killed a fly.

84
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,963
I don't have a lot of love
for the narcos either.

85
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:49,430
[in Spanish]
It's on, boys!

86
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:52,767
We're gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.

87
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,895
Riano, Trujillo,
you're in the front with me.

88
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:58,189
- Galvis and Silva, you take up the rear.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:00,775
You got it, boys? We're gonna
go at it with everything we got.

90
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,652
We're gonna kill these fuckers,
all right?

91
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,154
[all]
Yes, sir!

92
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:08,407
[up-tempo Latin music playing]

93
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,954
[men calling out in Spanish]

94
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:20,253
[Steve] I wouldn't blame you if you
held me responsible for this bloodbath.

95
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:23,298
[music playing loudly]

96
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,633
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

97
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:27,676
[Steve]
Yeah, I pushed the buttons.

98
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:36,435
- [overlapping gunfire]
- [screaming]

99
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,191
But don't call me a bad guy just yet.

102
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,367
My fellow Americans...

103
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,785
[Steve]
Take Richard Nixon, for instance.

104
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,956
People forget,
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.

105
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,959
We thought he was one of the good guys.

106
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:27,255
And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet
was a good guy

107
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:29,048
because he hated the commies.

108
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:31,717
So we helped Pinochet seize power.

109
00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:34,262
[sirens wailing]

110
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:39,934
Then Pinochet turned around
and killed thousands of people.

111
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:45,689
- [crowd chanting in Spanish]
- Maybe not such a good guy after all.

112
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:55,241
But sometimes,
bad guys do good things.

113
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,705
Nobody knows this, but back in '73,
Chile was on its way

114
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:05,709
to being the world's biggest
cocaine processing and exporting center.

115
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:10,672
[in Spanish] How many times do
I have to tell you not to waste the acid?

116
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,302
[Steve] They had deserts to hide the labs
and miles of unpatrolled coastline

117
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,511
to ship the product north.

118
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:19,265
To be productive,
you can't waste money! Come on!

119
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:20,557
[chatter in Spanish]

120
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:22,351

You're surrounded!

- [man 2] Hands up!
- [man 1] Everybody on your knees!

122
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,481
[Steve]
But Pinochet spoiled the party.

123
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,441
- What the fuck is going on here?
- [weapons cocking]

124
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:29,525
On the ground!

125
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:33,862
[Steve] He shut down 33 labs
and arrested 346 drug dealers.

126
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,994
And then, being Pinochet...

127
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:43,080
he had them all killed.

128
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:45,791

[man grunting]

134
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:07,896
[Steve] They say when
a nuclear holocaust destroys the world,

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,900
- only the cockroaches will survive.
- [panting]

136
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,694

[groaning]

138
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:20,951
The bullets missed Mateo Moreno,
aka Cockroach,

139
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,287
and he was smart enough to play dead.

140
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,501
He wasn't killed on that day.

141
00:09:30,794 --> 00:09:33,922
Instead, he won the damn lottery.

142
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:41,013
Cockroach had been
stealing from his bosses for months.

143
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:44,433
Now he was left alone in the world
with the perfect product.

144
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,020
A product whose offer
creates its own demand.

145
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:51,482
[in Spanish] Start packing.
We have to leave the country.

146
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:54,443
Fucking Pinochet
is killing the whole world.

147
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,990
- But you're not a communist.
- No, not a communist, something worse.

148
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:02,410
A drug trafficker.

149
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:05,746
- A drug trafficker?
- Yes, a drug trafficker.

150
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:12,253
[Steve] Back then, we were just
finding out about the effects of cocaine

151
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:15,172
- on the human brain.
- [button clicking]

152
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:18,509
We didn't know much, but we knew
it was some pretty powerful shit.

153
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:20,928
...this will give us better results, OK?

154
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:24,223
Cocaine hijacks
the pleasure centers in the brain.

155
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:27,518
A rat will choose cocaine
over food and water.

156
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:33,441
It would choose cocaine over sleep,
over sex... over life itself.

157
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:36,652
The human brain
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...

158
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:40,906
unless we're talking about cocaine.

159
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:49,373
Cockroach knew
he had the perfect product.

160
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:52,709
He just needed to smuggle it
to the right markets.

161
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:54,169
[Cockroach] Gracias.

162
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:58,924
And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.

163
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:00,134
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA

164
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:02,637
[cheers and applause]

165
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,348
Like Goldilocks,
he had three options.

166
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,685
And pay attention, because all three
are important to this story.

167
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,568
The Ochoa brothers:
Jorge, that's Fabio on the horse.

168
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:21,363
- A typical Colombian smuggling family.
- [chatter in Spanish]

169
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,865
- They were smart and rich...
- [shouts] Salud!

170
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,119
...but Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.

171
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:31,957
Another possible partner
was José Rodríguez Gacha,

172
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,836
nicknamed "The Mexican,"
for his love of tequila and sombreros.

173
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,714
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.

174
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:42,468
- [up-tempo Latin music plays]
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]

175
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:49,183
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade,
even by Colombian standards.

176
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,767
If you make it to the top...

177
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:55,230
- it means you've killed your enemies.
- [people screaming]

178
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,360
[in Spanish]
Hey, partner. What are you doing here?

179
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,195
[Steve]
And sometimes, your partners.

180
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,037
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.

181
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,671
So he zeroed in on his third option:
a man Cockroach knew would be just right.

182
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:21,507
[in Spanish]

183
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,761
[Steve]
Yeah, you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.

184
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:28,180
The man who would
change my life forever.

185
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:33,394
Pablo was making a killing
in the smuggling business.

186
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,937
Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana,
you name it.

187
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,817
At the time,
Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.

188
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:45,406
But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.

189
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:48,701
They didn't play by the same rules.

190
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:51,579
[Pablo speaking Spanish]
Good day.

191
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:53,622
Pablo Escobar?

192
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,123
Where's Felipo?

193
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:57,251
Felipo's been arrested.

194
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:59,127
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

195
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,214
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

196
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:04,717
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.

197
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,927
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax, Gustavo, please.

198
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,596
Show some respect.

199
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:13,016
Now what's the problem,
Mr. Jose Luis?

200
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,104
How do you know my name?

201
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:19,356
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

202
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:24,069
And that's Nacho Ibarra.

203
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:31,118
There's Garcia, Lopez...

204
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,245
- Is that Pinilla?
- [Gustavo] Yes, Pinilla.

205
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:34,455
- That's Pinilla.
- Yeah.

206
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:36,039
Pinilla...

207
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:37,958
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

208
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,127
I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

209
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,754
I don't have all day.

210
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,551
Open it.

211
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,976
[Herrera chuckles]

212
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,604
Tell me something, Mr. Escobar.

213
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:01,398
Who the fuck do you think you are?

214
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:04,901
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

215
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,779
Because I pay for the privilege, Colonel.

216
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:08,572
Oh, yeah? You don't say.

217
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:10,449
Where are your import papers?

218
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,786
You need papers for these TV sets.

219
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,287
Take them.

220
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:16,913
[chuckles]

221
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:22,085
Sorry, Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medellín police making a shit salary.

222
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,505
- Look, brother, it's not for you.
- Then who?

223
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,381
It's for Carlitos.

224
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,425
Your son.

225
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:33,305
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?

226
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,809
Hey, Pinilla!

227
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,189
Your daughter just
got her driver's license, right?

228
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:48,195
I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

229
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:53,492
That friend of yours, Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.

230
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:56,995
- Right? She's a fox.
- [Gustavo] Yeah.

231
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:58,873
Your wife is gorgeous, brother.

232
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,834
What's she doing with a guy like you?

233
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:10,676
I think she deserves some jewelry, no?

234
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:15,890
Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

235
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:22,479
Colonel, how is your mom doing?

236
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:25,733
- She just got out of the hospital, right?
- Yes, she's feeling better.

237
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:28,985
- Good. That makes us happy, right?
- [Gustavo] Yes.

238
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:31,530
Gentlemen...

239
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:34,783
I'm going to tell you who I am.

240
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:39,162
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

241
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,541
My eyes are everywhere.

242
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,587
That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia

243
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,755
without me knowing about it.

244
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:50,925
Do you understand? Not a finger.

245
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:57,765
One day, I'm going to be
President of the Republic of Colombia.

246
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:02,895
So look, I make deals for a living.

247
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:06,523
Now, you can stay calm
and accept my deal...

248
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,860
or accept the consequences.

249
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,865
Silver...

250
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,076
or lead.

251
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,121
You decide.

252
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,711
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
- [Pablo] All right, then.

253
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:30,965
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

254
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:44,519
[vibrant Latin song playing]

255
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,383
[man shouts]
Yo, Pablo!

256
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,845
- This is Pablo.
- [Cockroach] Hello.

257
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:19,888
- Nice to meet you.
- [Gustavo] Mateo Moreno.

258
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,474
No, no, no.
"Cockroach" to my friends.

259
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:24,476
[Gustavo] All right,
yesterday we were talking,

260
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,023
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

261
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:30,482
Explain.

262
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:33,610
Well... I get the paste in Peru.

263
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,737
I will handle
the chemical part of production,

264
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,323
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

265
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,826
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

266
00:17:41,035 --> 00:17:44,287
- Now tell him how much it costs.
- [chuckles]

267
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:48,333
In Chile, this little thing
costs ten bucks a gram.

268
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:52,170
- They sell it by grams?
- Yes, it's very good. Look...

269
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:57,467
You do a little bit, and in 20 minutes,
you want to do some more.

270
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,053
Also...

271
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,472
it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

272
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:05,100
It's very clean, this stuff.
Want some?

273
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:08,812
If this is really that good
and we can make some money,

274
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:10,814
- we can find room on our trucks.
- [Cockroach sniffs]

275
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:13,358
We can sell it in Bogotá, Barranquilla,
Cali, Cartagena...

276
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,819
We're going to be rich.

277
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:18,655
- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

278
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:22,117
Well look, Cuca...

279
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:25,120
you don't have any vision,
my friend.

280
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:30,125
If it costs ten dollars a gram here...

281
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,379
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

282
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:37,424
- [song ends]
- [grunts]

283
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,968
- [light applause]
- [Pablo] I love that song.

284
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:44,723
Rodrigo! One more.

285
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:45,974
[stomps foot]

286
00:18:46,182 --> 00:18:48,226
[song begins again]

287
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,354
[singing along in Spanish]

288
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:10,582
[Steve]
Back then, Miami was a paradise.

289
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:13,543
I signed up for the sand,
surf and women.

290
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:18,465
In '79, the bad guys I was chasing
wore flip-flops.

291
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,716
[Steve shouts]
DEA! Stop!

292
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,929
I was a young DEA agent,
partnered with my buddy, Kevin Brady.

293
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:27,182
Kevin was a little slow afoot.

294
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:30,477
[grunts]

295
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,728
[Steve]
Why you running, huh?

296
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,815
What you got?
What is this? Huh?

297
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:35,816
What is that?

298
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:39,027
That right there...
that's a goddamn promotion.

299
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,196
- [laughs]
- [exhales] Let's go celebrate.

300
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:42,864
- Whoo!
- Look at that.

301
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:45,200
[disco music playing]

302
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:47,828
- Go! Go! Go!
- [laughing]

303
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:50,371
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Kevin] How you like me now?

304
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,623
How much money you owe me?

305
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:53,458
What happened to the money
you owed me last week?

306
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,169
That's right, that's right.

307
00:19:57,754 --> 00:20:00,757
All right.
All right, who do we pick?

308
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,467
How 'bout her?

309
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,969
No, no, no,
we gotta fuck with him.

310
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:06,054
- Yeah, let's mess with his head.
- Um...

311
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,973
Oh, right there.
See her? At the bar?

312
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:10,184
- Which one?
- Blue top, blond hair. That's his type.

313
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:13,353
- [Steve laughing] Oh! Strike!
- She's hot.

314
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:14,729
- All right.
- Whoo!

315
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,940
[clears throat]
Murph! Sparrow, three o'clock.

316
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:20,861
Hey, while you were walking back,
she was checking your ass out.

317
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:22,487
Oh, she was checking out your ass.

318
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,989
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on.

319
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:27,951
[Kevin] Listen, she eye-fucked you
the entire time you were bowling.

320
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,704
She was. She was eye-fucking you.
The entire time.

321
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:34,332
[snorts]
I'm serious, I'm serious. Look at her.

322
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,127
- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

323
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:38,753
No, the other one.
Of course the blond one.

324
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,547
She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.

325
00:20:41,297 --> 00:20:44,592
- You dicking me around?
- [Kevin laughs]

326
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:48,930
Fuck it, I'm going in.

327
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,182
- [Kevin] Go get her.
- [man] Mm!

328
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,059
- [Kevin] Yup.
- [man] Hey, while you're up there,

329
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:53,643
get us another pitcher, will ya?

330
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,855
- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.

331
00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:58,773
[men laughing]

332
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,984
[women talking indistinctly]

333
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,366
How you doing?

334
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,202
Busy.

335
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:15,331
I just said, "Look, if you don't
wanna be there, you don't have to be.

336
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:18,626
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So, I don't know... [indistinct]

337
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,129
[men cackling]

338
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,674
[Steve]
Yeah, those bastards got me.

339
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:27,094
But I couldn't let it end like that.

340
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:30,013
Excuse me. [clears throat]
See those guys over there?

341
00:21:31,306 --> 00:21:32,599
Uh, they're fucking with me.

342
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:36,144
Telling me you were checking out my ass,
and who checks out a cop's ass, right?

343
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,478
You're a cop?

344
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,898
Not a cop, actually. I'm DEA.

345
00:21:40,107 --> 00:21:41,149
Drug Enforcement?

346
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,235
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

347
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,613
Come on, why don't you do me a favor?
[clears throat]

348
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,283
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you, uh...

349
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:51,076
give me your phone number?

350
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,494
How about a fake number?

351
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,580
That'll work.

352
00:21:56,414 --> 00:21:58,125
Hey, buddy, you got a pen?

353
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,212
[sighs]

354
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:15,391
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

355
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,894
Have a good night.

356
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:23,275
- [Kevin] Aah...
- [men laughing]

357
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:24,525
[Kevin] Shot down!

358
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:28,363
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh, I...

359
00:22:29,072 --> 00:22:30,531
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

360
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,994
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

361
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:36,537
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.

362
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,290
How much did that cost you?

363
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:40,500
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

364
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:47,132
[dial tone]

365
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:49,592
- [dialing number]
- [Steve] I figured, what the hell.

366
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:53,096
Worst that could happen,
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.

367
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:56,350
[line ringing]

368
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:00,687
Hello?

369
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:03,648
So it wasn't a fake.

370
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:06,193
I thought you might figure it out.

371
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:08,695
After all, you're DEA.

372
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:12,157
[Steve]
And just like that... she had me.

373
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:18,621
The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru,

374
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,498
cocaine had him.

375
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,919
[in Spanish]
It's been a while.

376
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,588
These are my friends,
Pablo and Gustavo.

377
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,092
Would you like a little coffee?

378
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,802
Yeah, a coffee?

379
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:33,887
Yes, a coffee.

380
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,055
- How about you, Pablo?
- No.

381
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:36,681
[Cockroach]
You sure?

382
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:40,894
My factory is small,
but highly productive.

383
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:45,857
Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

384
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,610
Little magic leaves.

385
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,448
[man] The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

386
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:59,495
[Cockroach] Over here, the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

387
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:04,667
Then you cut it,
and mix it with gasoline.

388
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:08,755
Then, basically, you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

389
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,673
Let it dry, dry, dry.

390
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:12,508
[man]
You use ammonia to get the paste.

391
00:24:12,592 --> 00:24:18,139
[Cockroach] And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

392
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,475
Here is the prize.

393
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:22,977
It's like the kitchen in your house.

394
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:27,065
Like baking a cake.
[clears throat]

395
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,069
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

396
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:33,154
[chuckling]

397
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,365
Look, an old press, an antique.

398
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:42,956
Now we put it in the oven.

399
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,666
Here's one.
The other will follow.

400
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,836
All natural, organic and healthy.
Very good.

401
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:51,089
[Gustavo] Well...

402
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:55,635
- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

403
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:58,930
- No.
- [man] You said a kilo.

404
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:00,432
We'll take five.

405
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:04,436
[softly]
How do we get five across the border?

406
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,396
That's Gustavo's department.

407
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,112
[man]
This one has got a good engine.

408
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,823
I was taking a look at it,
and the best place to hide the merchandise

409
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,117
would be under the rear wheel well.

410
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,328
It's 22 and one half horsepower.

411
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:22,745
Is this easy to take off?

412
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:25,540
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

413
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:28,001
All right, all right.
I'll take three cars, please.

414
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:31,045
- Sure, when do you need them?
- Now, brother.

415
00:25:31,838 --> 00:25:34,715
All right, we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

416
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,968
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

417
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:42,223
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

418
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,518
- For three cars, that's 60 kilos.
- [Pablo counting softly]

419
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,937
So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram, what?

420
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:49,564
$9,000 per kilo.

421
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:52,192
$9,000 times 60...
The profit is $540,000.

422
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:54,486
- [laughing]
- That's it!

423
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,404
- Do you know how to drive, Cockroach?
- Yeah.

424
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,198
- OK, Pablo and I drive fast.
- [chuckling]

425
00:25:58,406 --> 00:26:02,160
[Steve]
That's half a million dollars... per trip,

426
00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:05,372
using the same smuggling routes
he always used.

427
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,959
Easiest money he ever made.

428
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:18,218
Back in Medellín,
Pablo didn't waste any time.

429
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:19,969
He bought a house
in his old neighborhood

430
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:25,099
and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.

431
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,935
[in Spanish]
How are you feeling, Gustavo?

432
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:31,523
All this smells like shit to me.

433
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:35,151
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

434
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:37,571
The stinkier, the better.

435
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:39,489
All right.

436
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,325
What about all these lights?

437
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,413
Is that to tip off the cops,
or what?

438
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:50,833
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

439
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:53,836
I'm the artist here, clear?

440
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,129
Clear.

441
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,257
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

442
00:26:57,424 --> 00:27:01,719
[Steve] It was a mom-and-pop operation,
so small they called it The Kitchen.

443
00:27:01,802 --> 00:27:05,557
But make no mistake,
it would change Medellín forever.

444
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,101
[in Spanish] You know the thing
that has me worried, Pablo?

445
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:12,897
[exhales]

446
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:17,569
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

447
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,365
[inhales deeply]

448
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,869
[voice strains]
Let's build them a chimney.

449
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:29,080
- [sputtering]
- [giggles]

450
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:33,167
- There you go.
- [laughing]

451
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,171
[Gustavo]
Gentlemen, the first three?

452
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:40,716
If this business makes so much money,
why are you sending me coach?

453
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,843
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

454
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:46,180
- Don't be a dick.
- No, no, don't give me that dumb shit.

455
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,767
- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?

456
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,936
[Gustavo] I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

457
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:58,985
[Steve] Like her son, Pablo's mother
Hermilda was very resourceful.

458
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:03,197
[Pablo speaking Spanish] Hey, Mom,
how much do you think we can fit in there?

459
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,701
- Around five kilos, honey.
- That much?

460
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,202
Trust me, Pablito.

461
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,246
I love it. Let's do it.

462
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,252
- Pablo.
- Thank you, my love.

463
00:28:17,753 --> 00:28:19,213
[knocking at door]

464
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,590
It's Gustavo.

465
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,800
Five kilos, right?

466
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:26,429
[Steve] Pablo loved his young bride Tata,
and she loved him.

467
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:28,931
He was a family man till the end.

468
00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:32,185
The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.

469
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:34,103
- Meet my friend.
- Hello, how are you doing?

470
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,313
Hey, Pablo, this is Lion.

471
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:38,525
[Steve] He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.

472
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:40,943
Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich, right?

473
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:43,029
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

474
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:44,656
- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you, Lion.

475
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:45,990
Here's three.

476
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:48,702
We're going to need two more,
right, Mom?

477
00:28:48,784 --> 00:28:50,578
- [Hermilda] That's right.
- Pablito...

478
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,080
make sure it is not you
who wears it, OK?

479
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,417
Look, my love...
it won't fit me. [chuckles]

480
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,252
Try it on.

481
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,546
Come here.

482
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:01,422
That's it.

483
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,923
Good, right?

484
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:06,511
One...

485
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:09,889
- two...
- Wow, it holds a lot!

486
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:11,432
...three.

487
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,142
[sighs]

488
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:15,269
- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.

489
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,021
He looks really handsome,
doesn't he?

490
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:19,982
[Hermilda] Listen, Lion,
that jacket fits you very nicely.

491
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:23,653
Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

492
00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:25,238
- Aah!
- Listen to this guy.

493
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:27,407
He looks very handsome, son.

494
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,825
- Like a fag model, isn't that right?
- [chuckles]

495
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,830
[Steve] The Lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.

496
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,252
Welcome to the United States.

497
00:29:39,335 --> 00:29:42,004
Thank you.
Have a great day.

498
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:42,963
Next, please.

499
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,842
[Steve] His contact was a crazy nut job
named Carlos Lehder,

500
00:29:46,926 --> 00:29:51,806
half Colombian, half German,
and 100 percent playboy.

501
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:55,184
Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf Hitler.

502
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:57,061
Go figure.

503
00:29:57,144 --> 00:30:01,065
Back in '79, this piece of work
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia

504
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:02,734
on a fleet of small planes.

505
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:04,736
- [in Spanish] What's up?
- What's up, son?

506
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:06,862
- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?

507
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:08,448
- Everything good?
- Everything's good.

508
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:10,157
Whoo! It's so hot.

509
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,118
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

510
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:13,578
You like my jacket, brother?

511
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:16,790
I got it in Colombia and look,
it has a little gift.

512
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,419
I was in jail for a while, remember?

513
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,548
I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

514
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:28,426
What you got there
is the perfect product.

515
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,970
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

516
00:30:31,053 --> 00:30:33,889
[laughs] It's gonna fuck up their brains,
that's for sure.

517
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:35,015
Yes, sir.

518
00:30:38,728 --> 00:30:39,895
Here you go.

519
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:43,483
Go on. There are five kilos.

520
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,318
Where are you going?

521
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:47,987
I'm gonna get another jacket,
brother.

522
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,406
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow,
all right?

523
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,288
[Steve] The Lion made more than 20 flights
between Medellín and Miami.

524
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:59,666
Drugs in, cash out.

525
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:03,002
And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.

526
00:31:03,085 --> 00:31:06,547
And in no time,
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.

527
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:10,217
Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes,

528
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,679
the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.

529
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:15,765
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.

530
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,393
The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.

531
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,937
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.

532
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:25,817
Ten trucks, 20 kilos each,
going back and forth every day...

533
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,987
You do the math.
No way the Lion could transport it all.

534
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,448
Pretty soon,
the Lion had to come up with new ways

535
00:31:32,532 --> 00:31:34,617
to smuggle the drug to Miami.

536
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:37,328
[in Spanish]
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?

537
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:39,914
You guys are pilots,

538
00:31:39,997 --> 00:31:43,376
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

539
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,298
Look, it's $150,000 per kilo,
so whatever you want.

540
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,343
We'll take four.

541
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:53,887
All right, much better.

542
00:31:53,969 --> 00:31:58,683
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

543
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:01,811
- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.

544
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:03,437
- See you later.
- Later.

545
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,148
Come in, please.

546
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,031
Look, here are the packets.

547
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:17,702
You take a packet...
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.

548
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,078
Easy, right?

549
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:21,706
You swallow 50,
and I pay you $10,000.

550
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:22,874
All right?

551
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:25,042
But with you two,
we have a problem.

552
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,044
You girls are pregnant, right?

553
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:31,758
That's good, because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.

554
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:36,679
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

555
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:39,891
And I'll pay you $15,000
to help you with the kids.

556
00:32:39,974 --> 00:32:42,435
All right? All right. Perfect.

557
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,355
[Steve] During the early '80s,
most flights out of Bogotá

558
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:48,274
had several mules on them.

559
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:50,443
They didn't even know about each other.

560
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:52,111
And you know what?

561
00:32:52,194 --> 00:32:56,323
Getting in was easy, because nobody
worried about cocaine in America.

562
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,367
All we cared about was grass.

563
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,370
[clucking]

564
00:33:01,454 --> 00:33:05,959
Pretty soon, cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.

565
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:10,087
Fish, coffee, flowers, rubber hoses...
anything.

566
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:29,148
But even that didn't do it.

567
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:34,487
The real game changer was filling
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.

568
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,700
[in Spanish]
Do you trust this guy?

569
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,369
I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.

570
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,539
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh, for sure he's gay.

571
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,249
But he's got good routes.

572
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:52,964
- Amigos!
- [Gustavo] Hello, Carlos.

573
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:54,423
Gustavo Gaviria,
nice to meet you.

574
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:55,758
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

575
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:57,677
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

576
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,763
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?

577
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:02,348
Smooth.

578
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,683
Let's get down to business.

579
00:34:03,766 --> 00:34:07,645
The Lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

580
00:34:07,728 --> 00:34:10,982
- That's true.
- About how much per flight?

581
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:13,776
- How far?
- Miami.

582
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,944
[sighs]

583
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:20,240
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- [Gustavo] 1000 kilos?

584
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,076
Counting the gasoline.

585
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:32,003
Carlos...

586
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,005
[Carlos] Yes?

587
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:41,428
What if we take out the seats,
the carpet and all the other crap

588
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:45,307
and only leave space for the pilot?
Can you fit more?

589
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:47,142
We'll leave the engine, right?

590
00:34:48,435 --> 00:34:49,937
- How much more?
- [chuckles]

591
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,439
About... 300 more.

592
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,486
All right then, Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.

593
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:01,908
[Steve]
Within months after meeting Cockroach,

594
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:07,080
Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to America.

595
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:11,751
It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics, folks.

596
00:35:12,752 --> 00:35:15,922
Then Pablo closed The Kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs

597
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:17,506
in the middle of the jungle.

598
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:22,553
Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest,

599
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:27,641
he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.

600
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:31,562
[clanging]

601
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:33,940
[in Spanish]
We brought you a little present.

602
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:35,816
- [chatter in Spanish]
- [woman laughs]

603
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,317
[Pablo]
Brazilians.

604
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:42,197
Best asses in the world,
believe me.

605
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:44,784
No, I'm not feeling well.

606
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:46,410
- What's up, Cuca?
- Hello.

607
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:48,370
Hey, Gustavo.

608
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:51,832
What the fuck is up with you guys?

609
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,585
You're flying around in planes...

610
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:56,963
- while I'm rotting here in this jungle?
- Look, Cuca--

611
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:59,715
Look, let us explain what we have to--

612
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,467
Wait.

613
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,845
From now on,
in all of my labs...

614
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:09,516
I'll build a large house
with air-conditioning, with a pool...

615
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,019
- [Gustavo] And whores from Brazil.
- ...and whores from Brazil.

616
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,521
- Just for you.
- One problem.

617
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:18,525
These are my labs. Mm?

618
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:28,619
Relax.
No one's arguing with you.

619
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:31,122
Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

620
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:34,458
[Steve] Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.

621
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:38,212
They were violent, crazy and filthy rich.

622
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:41,507
Guys used to getting what they want,
one way or another.

623
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,302
[in Spanish] How something like this
can make so much money!

624
00:36:45,385 --> 00:36:49,556
Now I ask myself...
if I should get involved with this.

625
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,600
What do you think, Pablo?

626
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:54,061
I heard the "potato" business
is like the "egg" business.

627
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:55,813
I wouldn't get involved.

628
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:59,150
Look, man,
I took a good look at the market.

629
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:01,485
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

630
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,948
- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.

631
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:08,951
Be careful, guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time,

632
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,746
the Peruvians will raise the price.

633
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,750
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

634
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:20,254
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

635
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:25,092
Well, guys, the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

636
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,555
You need a lot of creativity for that.

637
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:33,809
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?

638
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:37,688
You deliver the product to me, labeled.

639
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:41,316
I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

640
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,986
Better yet, Lehder will do it.

641
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,156
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value,

642
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,744
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

643
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:53,662
The potato business is ours.
We don't need--

644
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,497
Deal?

645
00:37:58,751 --> 00:37:59,919
Deal.

646
00:38:00,627 --> 00:38:02,213
Sounds good to me.

647
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:07,676
All right,
I will create my own routes

648
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,305
and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?

649
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:13,266
[Gustavo]
We expect nothing less, Gonzalo.

650
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:15,726
Partners?

651
00:38:19,813 --> 00:38:22,608
We know your policy toward partners.

652
00:38:24,193 --> 00:38:25,861
Let's just call us...

653
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:27,696
"friendly associates."

654
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:30,991
To Miami.

655
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,160
[all]
To Miami!

656
00:38:34,954 --> 00:38:36,538
[up-tempo '80s rock music plays]

657
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:47,841
[Steve] When I started, a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.

658
00:38:54,056 --> 00:38:57,768
And before long,
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.

659
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,316
We thought we were
making a huge difference.

660
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:12,325
Truth is,
we weren't even making a dent.

661
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,578
They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.

662
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,007
Pablo's coke flooded in.

663
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:31,551
It didn't take long
for Miami to get addicted.

664
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,095
And I mean that.

665
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:37,350
It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.

666
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:40,353
And with the money...

667
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:43,314
came the violence.

668
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,484
The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians,

669
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:50,237
and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.

670
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,223
The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.

671
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:21,143
Use 'em once,
then throw 'em away.

672
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:26,648
The Dade County morgue couldn't
fit all the bodies from the drug war.

673
00:40:26,732 --> 00:40:29,609
They had to rent a refrigerated truck
from a local company

674
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,653
to hold all the extra corpses.

675
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,699
That was the first person I ever shot.

676
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,161
A teenager not old enough
to buy a six-pack.

677
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,975
Hey... it was self-defense.

678
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:05,145
- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.

679
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,148
Did he forget to tell you
the kid was 17?

680
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:10,776
He sells drugs, right?

681
00:41:12,194 --> 00:41:14,071
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then fuck him.

682
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:16,949
[sighs]

683
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,371
What happened?

684
00:41:25,665 --> 00:41:28,210
- Coming through!
- [Connie] I was about to finish my shift

685
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:30,545
when we got hit
with the lights and sirens.

686
00:41:30,629 --> 00:41:31,964
Stay with me.

687
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:33,632
I have an unconscious pregnant female.

688
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,719
Paramedics said she collapsed
after she got off her flight.

689
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,265
By the time she got to us,
she was barely breathing.

690
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:45,102
- [nurse] Pressure 60 over 40.
- Dilated pupils, rapid pulse.

691
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:47,646
- I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...
- [flatline tone]

692
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:51,442
...but she had no residue on her nostrils,
no injection marks.

693
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,654
We did everything we could.

694
00:41:56,738 --> 00:41:58,365
She died in the ER.

695
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:02,536
We tried to save the baby...

696
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:10,085
The baby died in my hands.

697
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:14,340
I'm so sorry.

698
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,093
She was body-packing
11 ounces of cocaine.

699
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:20,720
Two of the pellets split open.

700
00:42:22,597 --> 00:42:26,268
[sighs]
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.

701
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:30,272
No one survives that.

702
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:36,570
[bugs chirring]

703
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:41,325
[in Spanish]
Why won't Pablo ever see me?

704
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:45,120
I spent all this time
waiting around for him.

705
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:47,373
Tell me something, Cockroach.

706
00:42:47,456 --> 00:42:50,083
Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

707
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,670
[dry chuckle] Fuck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

708
00:42:53,753 --> 00:42:58,717
If it wasn't for me, you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

709
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,594
Let me give you a piece of advice.

710
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,056
Never say that to Pablo.

711
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:07,142
He's not as forgiving as I am.

712
00:43:13,148 --> 00:43:15,234
[Steve]
Pablo was fucking Cockroach over.

713
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:18,695
But Cockroach
should've listened to Gustavo.

714
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:22,616
Instead, he found another way
to get his fair share.

715
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:28,038
- [man shouts in Spanish] Stop!
- [chatter in Spanish]

716
00:43:38,424 --> 00:43:40,509
What do you have in the spare tires?

717
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:46,681
390 kilos, Pablo.
We lost it.

718
00:43:47,766 --> 00:43:51,019
Gustavo, what do you mean
"we lost it"?

719
00:43:51,103 --> 00:43:52,979
Just what I said, we lost it.

720
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:59,194
We lost it? It just disappeared?
Into thin air or what?

721
00:43:59,278 --> 00:44:02,322
Don't mess with me, Pablo.
We lost it.

722
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,700
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

723
00:44:06,993 --> 00:44:08,120
Look...

724
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:14,418
we've paid every cop
from here to Ipsalia.

725
00:44:16,378 --> 00:44:18,422
So how did we lose a load, brother?

726
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:21,883
It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.

727
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:23,469
Know what I mean?

728
00:44:29,141 --> 00:44:30,809
And how much is he asking?

729
00:44:32,018 --> 00:44:33,395
Too much.

730
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:40,944
What are you going to do?

731
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:43,656
Come back, Pablo.

732
00:44:45,157 --> 00:44:48,076
Don't go and risk it for this asshole.
Come back.

733
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,828
Where are you going, Pablo?

734
00:44:50,537 --> 00:44:51,788
Pablo?

735
00:45:26,948 --> 00:45:29,409
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

736
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:43,923
What's going on, brother?

737
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:47,260
Mr. Escobar...

738
00:45:48,637 --> 00:45:51,640
- we need to renegotiate.
- Eat shit.

739
00:45:56,478 --> 00:45:59,272
Eat. Shit.

740
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,860
What if I shot you in the head?

741
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:09,742
- [phone ringing nearby]
- [chatter in Spanish]

742
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,961
[Ibarra]
Are you sure about this, Colonel?

743
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,381
[Pablo laughs]

744
00:46:24,464 --> 00:46:27,426
He hasn't stopped laughing
since we arrested him.

745
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:31,846
- [Pablo chortling]
- We're DAS, Ibarra.

746
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:33,890
What's that faggot gonna do?

747
00:46:37,436 --> 00:46:38,895
[photographer]
There we are.

748
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:40,773
No, lower, lower.

749
00:46:40,855 --> 00:46:42,190
No that low.

750
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,361
Ready.

751
00:46:46,445 --> 00:46:48,363
- [clears throat]
- [camera clicks]

752
00:46:50,824 --> 00:46:52,826
Another one, another one.
I'm ready.

753
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:55,287
[Pablo clears throat]

754
00:46:56,996 --> 00:46:59,499
- [Steve] Pablo didn't know it then...
- [camera clicks]

755
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,336
...but this mug shot was gonna cause him
a lot of grief down the line.

756
00:47:07,006 --> 00:47:09,301
[Ibarra speaking Spanish]
Remove the handcuffs.

757
00:47:14,556 --> 00:47:16,141
[Herrera]
You can go now, officer.

758
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,144
Sit down, Mr. Pablo.

759
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:28,278
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

760
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:35,201
That's a street value
of over four million dollars, Mr. Escobar.

761
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:38,371
And you only gave us $150,000.

762
00:47:39,914 --> 00:47:42,501
Well, that's what we agreed upon.

763
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,545
You know something?

764
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,674
I make deals for a living.

765
00:47:48,757 --> 00:47:53,804
Now you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

766
00:47:57,516 --> 00:48:00,686
Or we can renegotiate,
come to an agreement,

767
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:03,313
and everyone goes home happy.

768
00:48:05,858 --> 00:48:06,983
Deal?

769
00:48:11,029 --> 00:48:12,823
[sighs softly]

770
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,536
I'll give you one million dollars...

771
00:48:19,037 --> 00:48:21,122
under one condition.

772
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:24,042
What is it?

773
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:30,006
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

774
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:33,385
Otherwise, how would you know?

775
00:48:37,222 --> 00:48:39,307
Give me a name...

776
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,688
and you won't have
to split the cash with him.

777
00:48:48,441 --> 00:48:51,820
[Steve]
Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.

778
00:48:51,904 --> 00:48:55,073
Not only did he sell Pablo
to the authorities,

779
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:58,827
he was stealing from him all along
and selling his coke in Miami, too.

780
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:06,125
Cockroach's dealer was Germán Zapata,
a Colombian with a plumbing business

781
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,921
that served as a front
for his cocaine operation.

782
00:49:10,088 --> 00:49:14,843
He had 1200 keys in the van...
and guess who was buying the load?

783
00:49:18,137 --> 00:49:19,723
The plan was to trade vehicles,

784
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:22,893
and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.

785
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:27,105
1200 kilos.

786
00:49:27,188 --> 00:49:30,024
That would get us
on the cover of the Miami Herald.

787
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:33,612
OK, gringos.

788
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,697
How's the plumbing business?

789
00:49:35,781 --> 00:49:37,115
Fine.

790
00:49:37,198 --> 00:49:38,825
[murmur greetings in Spanish]

791
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,580
- [speaking English] How's it look?
- Plumbing business is very good.

792
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:45,290
[Kevin chuckles]

793
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:47,500
Come on, amigo.
I'll show you.

794
00:49:49,085 --> 00:49:50,629
[Steve]
Everything was going perfect.

795
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:55,717
Like I said, amigo...
100 percent pure.

796
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:57,719
[Steve]
Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.

797
00:49:57,803 --> 00:50:00,472
- Got a full load here, Murph--
- [automatic gunfire]

798
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:02,265
[screaming]

799
00:50:03,516 --> 00:50:05,310
[car alarm wailing]

800
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:07,270
[single gunshot]

801
00:50:08,062 --> 00:50:10,690
Don't move! Don't move.

802
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,902
- Don't move! Don't move.
- [man speaks Spanish]

803
00:50:13,986 --> 00:50:15,278
Get down!

804
00:50:18,698 --> 00:50:21,034
- Hands! Down!
- [car alarm stops]

805
00:50:21,117 --> 00:50:22,201
Don't look at me.

806
00:50:25,705 --> 00:50:26,915
[whispers] Fucking...

807
00:50:46,518 --> 00:50:51,064
In the case of
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego Díaz,

808
00:50:51,147 --> 00:50:54,275
after taking into account
all due considerations,

809
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:59,572
bail has been set at two million dollars,
or a bond of $200,000.

810
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:00,824
[slams gavel]

811
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:04,243
[Steve] I got to the courthouse early
the day of La Quica's trial.

812
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,413
My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.

813
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,086
The US District Attorney said La Quica
met his bail of two million dollars,

814
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:17,883
paid by a wire transfer from, well...
why don't you take a guess?

815
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:22,428
La Quica boarded
and was back in Medellín by midnight.

816
00:51:25,223 --> 00:51:31,563
From '79 to '84,
there were 3,245 murders in Miami.

817
00:51:32,647 --> 00:51:34,858
And outside the Tourist Bureau
and the cops,

818
00:51:35,067 --> 00:51:37,360
no one much cared about that.

819
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:41,907
What got the US government
to take notice was the money.

820
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:46,536
Billions of dollars a year,
all flowing from the US to Colombia.

821
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,623
And that... America couldn't take.

822
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:56,462
A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.

823
00:51:56,671 --> 00:52:00,717
They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.

824
00:52:01,634 --> 00:52:06,098
Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.

825
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,601
Whatever it was, the businessmen
came at just the right time.

826
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:12,520
It's back-to-school time
for America's children...

827
00:52:12,604 --> 00:52:15,982
[Steve] It was time for America
to suit up against a new enemy.

828
00:52:16,816 --> 00:52:19,235
Drugs are menacing our society.

829
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:22,864
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

830
00:52:22,948 --> 00:52:25,033
They're killing our children.

831
00:52:25,117 --> 00:52:26,910
[Steve]
It was classic Reagan.

832
00:52:26,993 --> 00:52:29,913
Folksy, direct and tough.

833
00:52:29,996 --> 00:52:33,249
He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.

834
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,668
But it was Nancy who stole the show.

835
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:39,965
So to my young friends out there,
life can be great.

836
00:52:40,048 --> 00:52:42,175
But not when you can't see it.

837
00:52:42,258 --> 00:52:47,472
So open your eyes to life, to see it
in the vivid colors that God gave us

838
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:49,849
as a precious gift to His children.

839
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,935
Say yes to your life.

840
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:56,314
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...
just say no.

841
00:52:56,397 --> 00:52:58,858
No, no, no!
No, Pablo, no, no!

842
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,026
- No, no!
- [gunshot]

843
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:00,944
[gasps]

844
00:53:04,656 --> 00:53:08,034
[Steve] They say when a nuclear holocaust
destroys the world,

845
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,120
only the cockroaches will survive.

846
00:53:10,203 --> 00:53:12,330
Leave that piece of shit there.

847
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:14,290
[Steve]
I guess they were wrong.

848
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,337
During his career,
Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.

849
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:22,132
But I wouldn't learn that till later.

850
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:31,933
My dad volunteered to fight
in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.

851
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,186
But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?

852
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,604
No way.

853
00:53:37,271 --> 00:53:41,818
He was a West Virginia farm boy,
but these fuckers stepped on our soil.

854
00:53:42,777 --> 00:53:45,613
So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.

855
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,158
It was his duty.

856
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,953
Cocaine in Miami?

857
00:53:52,037 --> 00:53:53,955
Kilos from Colombia?

858
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,333
This was my war.

859
00:53:57,416 --> 00:53:59,919
This was my duty.

860
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,796
And I was ready to fight it.

861
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,465
And my wife was ready
to fight it with me, too.

862
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:05,758
Your ticket, please.

863
00:54:07,135 --> 00:54:08,302
OK.

864
00:54:08,386 --> 00:54:11,389
We had no idea
what we were in for.

865
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:17,062
One year later... all that patriotic
bullshit was right out the window.

866
00:54:17,145 --> 00:54:18,813
[Javier over radio]
OK, man, what do we got?

867
00:54:18,897 --> 00:54:22,025
- We got Poison...
- Excellent. Who else?

868
00:54:22,108 --> 00:54:23,442
We got Lizard.

869
00:54:24,569 --> 00:54:26,320
Uh...

870
00:54:26,404 --> 00:54:27,822
We got, we got...

871
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,536
- Big Badmouth.
- That motherfucker.

872
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:36,289
- Thank you for the gift, agent.
- No problem.

873
00:54:37,999 --> 00:54:39,167
[camera shutter clicks]

874
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:55,975
[Steve] If there's one thing
I've learned in the narco world,

875
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:59,062
it's that life is more complicated
than you think.

876
00:55:00,105 --> 00:55:03,775
Good and bad...
they're relative concepts.

877
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:08,947
In the world of drug dealers,
you do what you think is right...

878
00:55:09,864 --> 00:55:11,908
- and hope for the best.
- [camera shutter clicks]

879
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:15,620
[man speaks Spanish]
Look at what happened, boss.

880
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,039
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.

881
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:23,920
- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.

882
00:55:24,003 --> 00:55:27,132
And there was a gringo DEA agent
taking pictures.

883
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:33,888
- Raise the bounty.
- On Carrillo, sir?

884
00:55:36,141 --> 00:55:39,769
I'll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

885
00:55:39,852 --> 00:55:41,313
Half a million?

886
00:55:41,395 --> 00:55:42,605
Do it.

887
00:55:42,688 --> 00:55:44,190
As you wish, sir.

888
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,447
Fucking gringos.

889
00:55:53,658 --> 00:55:56,661
