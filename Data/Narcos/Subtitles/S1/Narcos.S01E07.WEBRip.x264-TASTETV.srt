1
00:00:01,354 --> 00:00:04,190
(man in Spanish) This is one of the
largest and most mysterious plane crashes

2
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:05,732
in Colombian history.

3
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:09,152
It may have been a bomb
that blew up a plane in Colombia today.

4
00:00:09,153 --> 00:00:11,280
The Boeing 727 of Avianca Airlines...

5
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:13,782
(newswoman in French)

6
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:18,661
(Steve)
In his unsuccessful attempt

7
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:21,832
to assassinate presidential candidate
César Gaviria,

8
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:25,002
Pablo Escobar murdered
107 innocent people.

9
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:29,756
The "Paisa Robin Hood"...
had become a terrorist.

10
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:31,633
(reporter in Spanish)

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,344
(man in English)
But American intelligence authorities

12
00:00:34,345 --> 00:00:38,015
say the drug bosses in Colombia
have to be considered prime suspects.

13
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:45,064
(baby crying)

14
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:48,316
(Carrillo in Spanish)
You know where Jaime is?

15
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:51,362
No, sir.
I don't know where he is.

16
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:54,114
He left home and hasn't returned.

17
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:57,616
- Have Pablo and his men come by here?
- (girl) No.

18
00:00:57,617 --> 00:00:59,994
- (Javier) Your name is Natalie?
- (Natalie) Yes, sir.

19
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:03,999
Natalie, your boyfriend, Jaime,
was he with Pablo's sicarios?

20
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:06,752
- No.
- Are you sure?

21
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:08,669
Yes, sir.

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,049
Well, then, why do you have
this picture of Pablo in your house?

23
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:16,929
Nothing wrong with that.
Everyone in the comuna has one.

24
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:20,224
You think those thugs
are going to protect you?

25
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:24,853
You don't understand...
that you represent a big problem for them.

26
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:27,565
We can help you.

27
00:01:27,773 --> 00:01:31,902
We can protect you.
But you have to tell us the truth.

28
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:39,368
(Javier flicks lighter)

29
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:42,788
(in English) She's lying.

30
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:46,832
He's got this poor sucker to carry a bomb
without him even knowing it.

31
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:50,962
- Well, maybe he knew.
- I don't care if he knew or not.

32
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:52,965
It's time we put a bullet in Escobar.

33
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,097
(Pablo in Spanish) I don't want
to leave, my love. I don't want to leave.

34
00:02:00,306 --> 00:02:03,099
But I must, for all our safety.

35
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,977
Did you do something wrong?

36
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:10,899
Your dad did nothing wrong.

37
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:19,783
These are people who are jealous of us,
who are trying to take what we have.

38
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:22,369
(whispers)
You have to be strong.

39
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:26,705
I want you to be strong.

40
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:30,376
You have to be strong
and never show weakness.

41
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:32,254
I promise I'll never be weak.

42
00:02:34,423 --> 00:02:36,842
And watch out for your sister.

43
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:45,559
I love you very much.

44
00:02:48,354 --> 00:02:49,938
I love you all very much.

45
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:52,982
- Mama.
- (Hermilda) Pablo?

46
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:56,777
- Do not spoil this boy.
- (Hermilda) But... what do you mean?

47
00:02:56,778 --> 00:03:01,908
- Watch her.
- Just a few sweets and some pork rinds.

48
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,836
Be careful, son. Be careful.

49
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:28,018
- I love you.
- (whispers) Me, too.

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,104
Take care.

51
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:34,692
(softly) And what about you?

52
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,902
Come on.
I'm going to take you with me.

53
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:41,614
I'm going to take you with me...
I'm going to take you with me.

54
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:43,867
(all chuckling)

55
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:50,082
(sighs)

56
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,964
(Pablo whispers) Take care.

57
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:03,928
(door opens)

58
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:06,598
You think he did it?

59
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,642
- (door closes)
- Surely not.

60
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:13,063
Blow up that plane?

61
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:18,150
Of course he did it, Hermilda.

62
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:20,112
But he had his reasons.

63
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:28,245
We've got everyone looking
for Jaime's wife throughout the comunas.

64
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:32,583
I want you to find her and kill her.

65
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:37,296
And kill any motherfucker that
can connect me with that fucking plane.

66
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,923
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:42,551
(starts engine)

68
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:52,603
Sync and corrected by Elderfel
www.addic7ed.com

69
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:22,107
(man in Spanish) ...the functions
of President of Colombia?

70
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:23,527
(Gaviria) I swear.

71
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:25,319
(applause)

72
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,907
(Steve) The Avianca bombing created
a tidal wave of support for César Gaviria.

73
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:36,456
He became the 28th President of Colombia
by a landslide.

74
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:38,916
(indistinct chatter)

75
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:44,589
(in Spanish)
Well, César, congratulations.

76
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,465
Not César... I mean, Mr. President.

77
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:48,050
- (chuckling)
- Salud.

78
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:49,385
- (woman) Salud.
- Salud.

79
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:50,554
Excuse us.

80
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:57,309
- As a former president to a new one...
- Mm-hm?

81
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,562
...what advice would you give?

82
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:05,317
Well... you'll be asked
to make many difficult decisions.

83
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:08,613
I would say one thing...
do what your wife says.

84
00:07:08,614 --> 00:07:11,032
- I always do.
- (both chuckling)

85
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:20,625
Trust your instincts,
and be confident in your decisions.

86
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:22,001
Yes...

87
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:25,922
but that's easier said than done.

88
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:28,257
You'll never be able to please everyone,

89
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:30,843
so find the solution
that rings true in your heart.

90
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:32,094
Thank you.

91
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,847
Another thing I did want to tell you,
about the Americans--

92
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,809
What about the Americans?

93
00:07:37,893 --> 00:07:41,854
This will have to be off the record,
my dear.

94
00:07:41,855 --> 00:07:45,817
I can't have my opinions
broadcast on your television show.

95
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:47,820
No, no, no.
You have my word.

96
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:51,364
- The Americans...
- Yes?

97
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:53,784
Be careful.

98
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,996
(in English) We killed José Rodríguez
Gacha with a minimal loss of life.

99
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:02,750
Bringing Escobar to justice
is my number one priority.

100
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:07,087
But we will do so
on our own terms and own resources.

101
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:08,840
(Noonan)
We wanna help you catch Escobar.

102
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:12,927
I have enormous gratitude to you,
especially with Agent Murphy,

103
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:14,680
whose warnings kept me off that plane.

104
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:17,850
You, sir, yes. Unfortunately,
not the rest of the passengers.

105
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:22,269
The people in Colombia are horrified
about the bombing of Avianca's plane.

106
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,732
But they're also against
American soldiers on our soil

107
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:29,319
and spy planes intercepting calls, so--

108
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:32,571
America doesn't intercept
civilian phone calls. That's absurd.

109
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:36,075
Presidente, you need
additional resources to get this man.

110
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:38,620
Well...

111
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:42,414
your government's research says...

112
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:48,839
660 tons of cocaine were consumed
in the United States last year.

113
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:55,260
Perhaps if your resources
were focused at home,

114
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,596
we'd all be better off.

115
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:58,138
(clears throat)

116
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,351
(Steve) Gaviria made good
on his promise to go after Escobar.

117
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:04,813
(men shouting)

118
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:08,984
Colonel Carrillo's Search Bloc
was set loose with a vengeance.

119
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:12,820
Carrillo mounted dozens of raids.

120
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:14,364
(indistinct chatter in Spanish)

121
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:19,036
But with an army of informants,
Escobar somehow always got away.

122
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:24,207
We sat on the sidelines,
hands tied by bureaucracy.

123
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:30,629
In response, Pablo took
his narco-terrorism to a whole new level

124
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,593
with a bombing campaign that would
shake the country to its foundations.

125
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:40,432
In doing his best to avoid war,
that's exactly what Gaviria got.

126
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,977
And the toll on both sides
was devastating.

127
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:48,857
The thing about war is...
it's just bad for business.

128
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:54,486
And when you got a bull's-eye
on your back... your rivals get bold.

129
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:56,864
(up-tempo Latin music playing)

130
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:59,366
- Pablo.
- (in Spanish) What's up, Pacho?

131
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:00,910
(Steve) That's right.

132
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:03,955
Pablo and the Medellín cartel
weren't the only game in town.

133
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:05,665
Thank you.

134
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:10,670
This is Helmer "Pacho" Herrera, one
of the four leaders of the Cali cartel.

135
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,046
(up-tempo Latin music plays)

136
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:14,966
While Pablo left a trail of bodies
and chaos in his wake,

137
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:19,012
Cali made problems disappear with an army
of lawyers and a mountain of legal briefs.

138
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:22,432
The Medellín cartel was Miami:

139
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:26,603
swimming pools, bikini girls...
tacky as a two-tone Cadillac.

140
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:29,688
- ('80s dance music plays)
- The Cali cartel was New York:

141
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:32,650
elegant, smooth, subtle.

142
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:35,778
Where they could fuel
the 24-hour nightlife with cocaine,

143
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:40,241
and still make sure everybody showed up
for work on Wall Street the next morning.

144
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,662
At first, Medellín and Cali
worked side by side.

145
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,792
But in Colombia, when money's involved,
blood inevitably flows.

146
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:53,045
There had been violence
between Medellín and Cali before.

147
00:10:53,046 --> 00:10:56,841
But right now, a war on two fronts
was not something Pablo could afford.

148
00:10:56,842 --> 00:11:02,178
(in Spanish) We have Miami...
and have left you alone in New York.

149
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:05,850
- Yes, for a price.
- Certainly.

150
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:11,272
Look, Pacho, we agreed that we would
share the Los Angeles territory...

151
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,942
and that hasn't been happening.

152
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:17,737
It seems you are not
holding up our agreement.

153
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:21,449
- How's that?
- Exactly what I'm saying, Pacho.

154
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:28,498
Look, Pablo...

155
00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:33,669
you know that our partners
sometimes operate independently.

156
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,922
If Mr. Galeano
and Mr. Moncada are correct,

157
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:40,134
then you have my assurance
that it will be rectified.

158
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:41,511
Thanks a lot, Pacho.

159
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,806
Disputes between us
cause needless bloodshed.

160
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:51,521
Then fix it. A war between our groups
is the last thing we need right now.

161
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:55,734
It would seem you already have a war.

162
00:11:56,776 --> 00:11:59,362
Maybe bombing that plane
was a step too far.

163
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:03,074
Careful, Pacho.

164
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:04,950
Careful.
The only difference between us

165
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:07,536
is our little misunderstanding
with the government.

166
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:09,330
And that will be resolved soon.

167
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,582
Besides, that's the business,
for all of us.

168
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,459
- Yes, it's true for all of us.
- Mm-hm.

169
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:16,755
The only war we are really fighting
is the war against extradition.

170
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:19,381
And the outcome of that
is something we're all interested in.

171
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:22,801
It's true, Gustavo.
Gustavo is right.

172
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:26,223
We have a common goal,
and that is to get rid of extradition.

173
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:30,893
The United States is big enough
for all of us to operate in.

174
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:35,899
Let's figure out Los Angeles
once you take care of your business here.

175
00:12:40,612 --> 00:12:41,905
You know what bothers me?

176
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:45,784
Your arrogance.

177
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:49,079
Your attitude, your air of superiority.

178
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:56,836
Careful, Pacho... that you don't
get yourself killed for that.

179
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:08,305
Thank you for coming.

180
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:27,992
- I'm gonna kill that homo bastard.
- (Moncada) Pablo, let me kill him.

181
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:29,244
Stop talking shit, Moncada.

182
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:33,455
We'll kill that fag later.
Right now, we can't be out in the open.

183
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:37,251
If that son of a bitch
starts selling shit in Los Angeles,

184
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:43,382
I'm personally gonna put a gun up his ass
and pull the trigger. I swear.

185
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:46,011
That will make him fall in love with you.

186
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:47,720
(laughing)

187
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:51,682
(Javier in English)
We got Escobar's most trusted soldiers:

188
00:13:51,683 --> 00:13:54,685
Poison, La Quica, Sure Shot, Blackie.

189
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:57,604
Cocky, careless motherfuckers.

190
00:13:57,605 --> 00:13:59,691
Now we're hearing about two new guys:

191
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:01,441
Fernando Galeano and Kiko Moncada,

192
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:03,735
basically picking up
where Carlos Lehder left off.

193
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:05,863
(Steve)
Kill the body, the head will die.

194
00:14:05,864 --> 00:14:08,574
Without Colombian permission
to put assets in the air, we can't help.

195
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:12,495
In terms of intercepts, yeah,
but what do you guys got on ground intel?

196
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:14,831
- You mean spies?
- (Steve) Yes.

197
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:17,208
(sighs, chuckles)

198
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:19,793
We don't have any narco assets.

199
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:22,880
Our human intelligence
is limited to communists.

200
00:14:22,881 --> 00:14:27,426
Besides, Gaviria doesn't want you
chasing Escobar with CIA spies.

201
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:29,221
But you got satellites
in the sky, right?

202
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:33,182
Yes, but to use them in pursuit of narcos
would be a direct violation

203
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:35,976
- of the order of our host country.
- Man, you're CIA.

204
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:37,436
You break rules all the time.

205
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:43,943
These are aerial photographs of comunas
controlled by Escobar and his associates.

206
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:46,153
- We'll use them to track his men.
- These are aerials.

207
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:50,199
- We can't track individuals with these.
- Take a look.

208
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,577
The Los Priscos gang controls El Poblado.

209
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:56,914
Here in Santa Cruz, we got the comuna
where they recruited the Avianca bomber.

210
00:14:56,915 --> 00:15:00,209
And both places more densely packed
than a Marrakesh bazaar.

211
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,212
So let's take a tip from the Colombians.

212
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:06,174
You notice anything special about these?

213
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:10,469
Search Bloc follows vehicle traffic
in the comunas. You've got...

214
00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:16,101
Japanese imports... four-by-fours.
Cars over 40 grand.

215
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,230
Narcos are the only ones
who can afford these cars.

216
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:23,024
Whenever aerials see these cars,
we know sicarios are inside.

217
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,985
- That's right.
- We start tracking these rice rockets,

218
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:28,238
we might be able to get to Escobar.

219
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:38,497
(up-tempo Latin music plays on radio)

220
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,294
(Sure Shot in Spanish)
I think it's up this way.

221
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,671
I don't want to shoot her.

222
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:49,341
Kill that cute girl?
And the baby, too?

223
00:15:49,342 --> 00:15:53,054
I don't know why the boss
wants us to kill that girl.

224
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:58,726
- What does she know about Avianca anyway?
- Just shut up and follow orders!

225
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:03,855
(Marina) Does he think
putting a bomb on every corner

226
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:05,400
is gonna get the police
to quit chasing him?

227
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:08,403
Gustavo, we need to get away,
out of this country.

228
00:16:12,615 --> 00:16:14,699
And go where?

229
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,870
We'll be treated like criminals
wherever we go.

230
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:24,209
They'll kill him, and you know it.

231
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,338
I just hope he doesn't
take you down with him.

232
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:30,508
(scoffs) This isn't our war.

233
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:35,930
This isn't war. It's negotiation.

234
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:44,229
Don't you understand
what an opportunity this is?

235
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,441
He's willing to consider
terms of surrender--

236
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:50,068
- Under what conditions?
- (overlapping dialogue)

237
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:52,321
My God, he just blew up a plane!

238
00:16:52,322 --> 00:16:54,739
Eduardo, calm down.
Let the man speak.

239
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:00,287
(exhales) We can end this violence
with dignity. It's good for both sides--

240
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:03,499
Do you realize
how stupid you sound right now?

241
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,791
César, this is absurd.

242
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:06,710
- Eduardo, please--
- This is a farce.

243
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:08,046
Please.

244
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:12,841
Let me deal with this. Please.

245
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:15,094
Fine. Whatever you want.

246
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:22,685
(softly)
We can at least begin a discussion, right?

247
00:17:23,728 --> 00:17:25,687
Even though you never stated it,

248
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:29,859
surely you'd like
to see the bombings stop.

249
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:34,321
- Yes. Yes, I would.
- Exactly.

250
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:37,741
So if we begin a dialogue,
they will cease.

251
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:42,788
That affords us all some time,
including the Search Bloc.

252
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:45,250
Fernando...

253
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:51,004
you saw his money,
and it blinded you to his soul.

254
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,174
That son of a bitch has no soul.

255
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,805
If telling him we're negotiating

256
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:03,809
allows the bombs to stop
while we find him...

257
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:06,771
then be my guest.

258
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:09,524
(exhales)

259
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:15,738
Thank you.
Really, thank you.

260
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:07,289
Look, man,
Pablo's turned into a saint.

261
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,706
Of course.

262
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:12,837
- He sends people straight to heaven.
- (laughs)

263
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:29,687
(sighs)

264
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:41,157
She's not here.
She might have just left.

265
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:44,202
Let's search the comuna.

266
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,996
Look, Poison, I'm telling you
Pablo is being paranoid.

267
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:50,041
Careful what you say, son.

268
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,711
One day,
he is going to ask me to kill you.

269
00:19:55,754 --> 00:19:57,755
Would you do it?

270
00:19:57,756 --> 00:20:00,468
If he asks me... of course.

271
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:03,012
There is no way around it.

272
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:06,391
Wouldn't you?

273
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:15,940
All right, all right,
let's just go find this girl.

274
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:18,194
We'll look around
and see where she's hiding.

275
00:20:19,778 --> 00:20:22,239
- (baby squeals)
- What's wrong?

276
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,658
Here you go.

277
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:26,284
It's OK, Natalie.
Don't worry.

278
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:31,206
Before you know it, we'll get you
some food. Right? Isn't that right?

279
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:32,375
Thank you.

280
00:20:32,584 --> 00:20:35,169
(thunder rumbling)

281
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:48,640
What then, Fernando?

282
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:51,477
Has the Colombian government
offered a truce?

283
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:56,106
The government
hasn't been willing to offer anything

284
00:20:56,107 --> 00:20:57,775
I would consider acceptable.

285
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,569
What did they offer?

286
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:03,448
They want you to admit...
(clears throat)

287
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:06,908
that you're responsible for Avianca.

288
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:10,037
And of course, I told them that--
That we can't even--

289
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:11,955
Is it that you're not negotiating a thing?

290
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:14,249
No, no, of course I'm negotiating--

291
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,462
Then why is Carrillo
stopping every car in the comunas

292
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:21,132
and killing my boys
with the help of the gringos?!

293
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:27,138
Why are the Americans helping them if we
are supposed to be negotiating, Fernando?

294
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:34,228
Gaviria doesn't want the gringos to know
he's willing to negotiate with you.

295
00:21:36,855 --> 00:21:38,023
That's it.

296
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,864
Be very careful, Fernando.

297
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,454
Yes, Pablo.

298
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:55,833
Yes.

299
00:22:17,854 --> 00:22:19,732
You've got to stop the bombing, Pablo.

300
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,280
I don't know what you're thinking anymore.

301
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:31,160
I think we should...

302
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:34,831
reorganize a bit...

303
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:42,546
and start sending our boys out to burn
some houses down and do some damage

304
00:22:42,547 --> 00:22:45,466
to politicians and senators
all over the country.

305
00:22:45,675 --> 00:22:50,220
And to the soldiers and cops in our way,
the judges who annoy us

306
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:51,763
and the reporters that watch us,

307
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:55,768
basically, we have to create a presence so
disruptive they'll want nothing but peace.

308
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:59,229
That's the only way
we're going to get there.

309
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,818
Is that it? Is that what you want?
A civil war?

310
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:09,156
- You've gone crazy, asshole.
- We have to fight, brother.

311
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:12,660
Let's put our hearts into this.

312
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:17,373
And if we all must die, so be it.

313
00:23:20,251 --> 00:23:21,669
Well, yes...

314
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:27,633
The thing is,
I don't want to die yet, Pablo.

315
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:37,308
(sighs)

316
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:38,770
Nor do I.

317
00:23:41,731 --> 00:23:44,149
But the bombs make the public want peace.

318
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:46,903
And that will influence the politicians.

319
00:23:56,454 --> 00:24:02,293
You're the one who says the politicians
don't give a shit about the public.

320
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:07,840
If you want to influence politicians,
you'll have to narrow your focus.

321
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:09,926
You know what I mean?

322
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,345
(Steve) Gustavo was right.

323
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:16,389
They needed a new strategy,

324
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,975
one that brought terror directly
to the people that mattered the most.

325
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:21,645
(Pablo) What about her?

326
00:24:21,646 --> 00:24:23,939
No, she is way too much of a princess.

327
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,483
Surely we would have problems with her.

328
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:27,568
My God, look at that face.

329
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:31,655
The media is going to love that fox,
right?

330
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:34,699
Sure they will,
but so will our boys.

331
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,327
Just think what
they're gonna do to her.

332
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:38,329
Well...

333
00:24:39,455 --> 00:24:42,040
I say let's start with her...

334
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,254
- (gunshot)
- (woman shrieks)

335
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:51,383
...and this fag.

336
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:54,887
- (tires screech)
- (shouts in Spanish)

337
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:58,223
Let's go!

338
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:02,728
And this cute couple.

339
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:06,147
- (tires squealing)
- (shouting in Spanish)

340
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:09,944
(Steve) When you kill someone, you lose
all your leverage the moment they're dead.

341
00:25:10,903 --> 00:25:13,697
Now, you take someone's children
away from them,

342
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:15,866
you'd be amazed
what they'd do to get them back.

343
00:25:15,867 --> 00:25:19,744
(in Spanish) Family members of
the most influential people in the country

344
00:25:19,745 --> 00:25:23,541
have been kidnapped
on the very streets they call home.

345
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,460
What does Pablo Escobar want?

346
00:25:27,252 --> 00:25:31,298
I'll see you tomorrow on the same channel
for a special report.

347
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:33,384
- (up-tempo news soundtrack plays)
- (bell rings)

348
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:39,390
Is everything all right?

349
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:44,478
All the victims are my friends.

350
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:54,488
(indistinct chatter in Spanish)

351
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:02,287
Excuse me.

352
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:09,252
(Valeria)
The kidnapping of Francisco Santos,

353
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:11,838
the editor in chief of the most important
newspaper in the nation,

354
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,883
is the latest and most shocking
in a string of kidnappings

355
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:17,218
orchestrated by the Medellín cartel.

356
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:18,930
Reporting to you, I'm Valeria Velez.

357
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:24,435
- All right.
- First on the scene, right? As always.

358
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:29,814
(chuckles) Maybe if you actually
had to work for a living,

359
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:32,401
you'd be hungry enough to get here first.

360
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:35,528
I found out from Santos' wife...

361
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:38,449
a half hour after
he didn't show up for dinner.

362
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:40,367
You?

363
00:26:41,368 --> 00:26:42,453
Who tipped you off?

364
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,790
It's a pleasure to see you,
as always.

365
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:49,418
(engine starting)

366
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:03,766
(clock chiming)

367
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:10,314
(Duque) These are Pablo's conditions
for the release of the hostages.

368
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:14,400
You've read them,
you can see they're very reasonable.

369
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:15,820
"Very reasonable," he says.

370
00:27:16,988 --> 00:27:19,865
You are definitely an imbecile, Fernando.

371
00:27:20,074 --> 00:27:22,033
And I'm going to tell you something.

372
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:26,246
You will get what you deserve very soon,
I assure you.

373
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:36,298
I'm also one of those hostages.

374
00:27:37,215 --> 00:27:43,722
I myself could be walking around calmly...
but like them, I am not free.

375
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:52,355
Escobar is asking us to surrender,
but that will never happen.

376
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:54,607
(Duque sighs)

377
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:57,527
If he releases the hostages
and turns himself in,

378
00:27:57,528 --> 00:27:59,989
we will take this into account.

379
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:04,869
Gaviria isn't going to bend.

380
00:28:07,997 --> 00:28:10,041
Then I'm going to break him.

381
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:14,378
(hushed whispers)

382
00:28:18,256 --> 00:28:20,300
You, get up from there.

383
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:28,266
(hostages gasping)

384
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:34,648
The body of Ofelia Hernandez was found
dumped next to the Presidential Palace.

385
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,902
One must admire President Gaviria.
I'm sure it can't be easy for him

386
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:42,113
to stand by his decision
to not negotiate with Escobar.

387
00:28:42,114 --> 00:28:44,533
- (continues indistinctly)
- What's the plan?

388
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:49,830
A few more hostages and they will give in.

389
00:28:52,457 --> 00:28:54,959
Their time is running out.

390
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,754
I'm talking about us.

391
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,966
What about us, Valeria?

392
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:09,307
I don't have time
for that pussy shit right now.

393
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:17,398
(Valeria) Colombia's sweetheart.

394
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:20,818
You know the only reason
this hag has any fame

395
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:22,947
is because her father was president.

396
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:26,408
I despise her.

397
00:29:27,952 --> 00:29:30,037
And why do you care so much?

398
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:35,583
(voice straining)
Your ratings are through the roof, right?

399
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:37,753
Hers are higher.

400
00:30:04,113 --> 00:30:05,697
- (gunshots)
- (groans)

401
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:09,367
(man) Open the door, quick!

402
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:12,537
Move!

403
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,915
- (man) Let's go!
- (indistinct chatter in Spanish)

404
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:17,042
Hurry up!

405
00:30:49,158 --> 00:30:50,617
(exhales)

406
00:31:00,044 --> 00:31:01,461
Where am I?

407
00:31:04,422 --> 00:31:05,549
Hello!

408
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:08,802
Tell me where I am.

409
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:12,805
Does my family know I'm alive?

410
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:14,308
(man) How would I know?

411
00:31:18,187 --> 00:31:19,437
Who are you?

412
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:23,483
You work for Escobar?

413
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:26,653
You can call me Gorilla.

414
00:31:29,365 --> 00:31:30,199
Gorilla.

415
00:31:32,284 --> 00:31:34,828
Very well... Gorilla.

416
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:37,622
Where's my crew?

417
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:41,001
Did you bring them here as well?

418
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:46,965
I'm here to guard you. That's it.

419
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:06,985
(overlapping chatter in Spanish)

420
00:32:12,616 --> 00:32:14,785
Ladies and gentlemen,
excuse me.

421
00:32:14,993 --> 00:32:18,913
We understand the frustration and pain
you must be feeling for your children,

422
00:32:18,914 --> 00:32:22,792
but believe me,
we are doing everything we can

423
00:32:22,793 --> 00:32:25,086
to make sure your children get home soon.

424
00:32:25,087 --> 00:32:27,964
Our daughter was kidnapped
on her way to an interview.

425
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:31,342
They killed the bodyguard.
No one is safe.

426
00:32:31,343 --> 00:32:36,639
As a former president, I understand
the terrible position you're in.

427
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,436
But we're here to find a solution.

428
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:43,439
I understand your frustration,
Dr. Turbay.

429
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:50,361
But if we give in now, any criminal
can hold our government hostage.

430
00:32:50,362 --> 00:32:54,657
This isn't "any criminal."
This is the worst criminal in the world.

431
00:32:54,658 --> 00:32:57,118
- And he is laughing at all of us.
- (Dr. Turbay) Mr. President,

432
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:02,581
you're proceeding as you must, but we must
act as the parents of our children.

433
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:05,461
Let's pray you find a solution.

434
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:10,714
(Steve) A good president
can stand up to external pressure.

435
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:13,551
It's the internal pressure
that can wear you down.

436
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:19,224
We knew the clock was ticking before
Gaviria had to cave in to Escobar...

437
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:24,521
but hopefully not before
our unauthorized operation struck gold.

438
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:29,525
Catching a top sicario could be the break
we needed in leading us to Pablo.

439
00:33:29,526 --> 00:33:30,402
Here.

440
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,447
We'd continue to join
in an "observational capacity."

441
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,199
(in Spanish) Hands up!

442
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,450
(in English) Up!

443
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:39,452
(in Spanish) Why are you driving this car?

444
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:43,164
I don't know. Someone paid me 50,000 pesos
to drive it around the city.

445
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:45,958
(Steve) The sicarios had figured out
we were tracking their rides.

446
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:49,504
So they traded down to junkers
to avoid our eye in the sky.

447
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:52,631
But we weren't the only ones
that had Pablo in the gun sights.

448
00:33:52,632 --> 00:33:54,509
(Pacho in Spanish)
Pablo came to see me.

449
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,676
(Jorge) Why?

450
00:33:55,677 --> 00:33:58,221
(Pacho) He wants to settle
the dispute we have in the US.

451
00:33:58,222 --> 00:33:59,722
The Los Angeles problems.

452
00:33:59,723 --> 00:34:02,683
(Fabio) He has bigger issues
than that right now.

453
00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:05,228
(Pacho)
He'll make a deal with the government.

454
00:34:05,229 --> 00:34:09,482
He's managed to secure
some very effective bargaining chips.

455
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:12,443
Of course,
he'll look after you guys, right?

456
00:34:12,444 --> 00:34:15,906
We haven't talked to Pablo in weeks.
He's in hiding.

457
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:20,076
Look at that.
What a beautiful animal, Jorge.

458
00:34:20,077 --> 00:34:21,119
You like it?

459
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,329
Yes, of course.

460
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,125
I'm sure he'll look after you.
After all, you're partners.

461
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,044
Yes, of course. Partners.

462
00:34:33,798 --> 00:34:38,428
(softly) You could always have your sister
put in a good word with Gustavo.

463
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,305
What do you mean?

464
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:43,559
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you knew.

465
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:47,521
It could be gossip.
You know how people like to talk.

466
00:34:55,571 --> 00:34:58,197
You should eat,
because you're going to be here a while.

467
00:34:58,198 --> 00:35:00,075
You're going to get very hungry.

468
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:03,369
I don't feel well.

469
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:07,123
What's wrong? Are you sick?

470
00:35:07,124 --> 00:35:09,126
I can get you some medicine.

471
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:13,213
It's not that kind of illness.

472
00:35:14,423 --> 00:35:20,637
I want to congratulate you.
I know you're a very good reporter.

473
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:23,265
Thank you.

474
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:28,228
Gorilla, how long have you been
working for Escobar?

475
00:35:28,437 --> 00:35:32,106
Oh, it's been a while.

476
00:35:32,107 --> 00:35:35,568
So you know what's going on out there,
don't you?

477
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:40,240
The truth is, I don't go out,
so I have no idea what's happening.

478
00:35:41,658 --> 00:35:45,035
What the fuck are you doing, Gorilla?
Why isn't she wearing the blindfold?

479
00:35:45,036 --> 00:35:46,454
I didn't know you were coming.

480
00:35:46,455 --> 00:35:49,666
Put it on, man!
We have to take her.

481
00:35:49,874 --> 00:35:50,917
Put that on.

482
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:56,213
- Says who?
- Didn't I tell you to stay quiet?

483
00:35:56,214 --> 00:35:57,966
Just put it on.

484
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:14,650
Pleasure to finally meet you,
Ms. Turbay.

485
00:36:16,151 --> 00:36:17,777
Sit down, please.

486
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:23,325
(chair sliding)

487
00:36:50,143 --> 00:36:52,354
I suppose you want me to interview you?

488
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,981
No, even better.

489
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:58,610
I'm going to interview you.

490
00:36:58,818 --> 00:37:03,198
So you can tell the world about
the humane treatment you've received here.

491
00:37:08,078 --> 00:37:10,872
Don't you want your parents
to know you're well?

492
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:13,917
That you're alive?

493
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:22,467
I don't want to become
a piece of propaganda for you.

494
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:25,803
Who do you think you are?

495
00:37:31,935 --> 00:37:35,980
So what's necessary, miss,
to have your cooperation?

496
00:37:43,988 --> 00:37:46,032
Let one of the hostages go.

497
00:37:49,953 --> 00:37:53,123
You and I know that
I'm the one you really want.

498
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:08,555
(Pablo) You see?

499
00:38:09,222 --> 00:38:12,892
Two reasonable people
coming to an agreement.

500
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:19,816
Maybe we can convince President Gaviria
to do the same. Right?

501
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:27,157
Mr. Escobar has shown
a willingness to negotiate.

502
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:31,786
This afternoon,
he let one of the hostages go.

503
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:33,871
President Gaviria...

504
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:39,586
I ask you to at least
consider discussions with Mr. Escobar.

505
00:38:44,966 --> 00:38:46,383
I don't understand.

506
00:38:46,384 --> 00:38:49,346
I thought you said he wouldn't bend,
but now he's let one go.

507
00:38:49,554 --> 00:38:51,764
Because he has your daughter.

508
00:38:51,765 --> 00:38:54,601
And she's worth more to him
than the rest of them combined.

509
00:38:56,311 --> 00:39:00,482
If you knew all I know, you'd understand
it's nothing more than a stunt.

510
00:39:00,691 --> 00:39:02,274
Give him what he wants.

511
00:39:02,275 --> 00:39:04,736
What he wants is an insult to us
and to this country.

512
00:39:04,944 --> 00:39:06,655
I don't care. I want my child!

513
00:39:06,863 --> 00:39:09,240
(Dr. Turbay) What I believe
my wife is trying to say is,

514
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:13,161
we'd like you to make a deal with Escobar.

515
00:39:14,078 --> 00:39:17,541
If you refuse,
we'll have to take certain measures.

516
00:39:17,749 --> 00:39:24,171
Financially, by robbing you of donors...
and politically,

517
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:29,594
by robbing you of whatever support
your legislative agenda needs.

518
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:34,182
Are you threatening me?

519
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:37,560
We all use the tools at our disposal.

520
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:41,773
You as a politician, me as a father.
I'm sorry.

521
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:44,526
Doctor...

522
00:39:45,777 --> 00:39:48,613
you told me to follow my instincts...

523
00:39:49,906 --> 00:39:53,117
and they tell me
not to give in to this criminal.

524
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:55,662
That was before they took my daughter.

525
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:37,871
(sighs)

526
00:40:40,998 --> 00:40:44,835
I came over as quickly as I could.
I was told you needed me urgently.

527
00:40:44,836 --> 00:40:46,212
What's up?

528
00:40:48,632 --> 00:40:49,466
You OK?

529
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,308
Tell Fernando...
I'm willing to open negotiations.

530
00:41:00,017 --> 00:41:03,146
We'll make a counter to Escobar's demands.

531
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:05,899
I thought you weren't going to negotiate.

532
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:08,819
(Gaviria sighs)

533
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:13,740
I have to stop this madness, Eduardo.

534
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:19,287
But God willing,
we can catch him first.

535
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:27,253
Tell the Americans
they can put their planes in the air.

536
00:41:31,424 --> 00:41:33,383
(Steve) And there it was.

537
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:37,096
Negotiate with a terrorist while
trying to catch him at the same time.

538
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,687
(in English) Hammer, we have calls
originating in Comuna 3,

539
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:47,230
Manrique, from known
sicario satellite phones.

540
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:48,984
(Javier)
Do you have a location?

541
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:51,277
(Sure Shot in Spanish) What?

542
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:53,822
Yes, we're here in Campo Valdés.

543
00:41:55,114 --> 00:41:56,782
Campo Valdés.

544
00:41:56,783 --> 00:41:59,994
That's in the central eastern area,
bordered by the Comuna Popular.

545
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:01,537
Roger that.

546
00:42:01,538 --> 00:42:02,997
Campo Valdés.

547
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:06,000
(Steve) Going into the comunas
without Colombian backup,

548
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:08,377
that's about the most dangerous
thing you can do.

549
00:42:08,378 --> 00:42:11,338
(in Spanish) We're gonna
score a quick goal and then come back out.

550
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:13,466
All right, all right. All right.

551
00:42:13,675 --> 00:42:16,260
That's how bad
we wanted to catch these guys.

552
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:19,555
- (baby crying)
- (Natalie sobs) Don't kill me, please!

553
00:42:19,556 --> 00:42:23,517
I swear I didn't hear anything!
I'm not going to say anything!

554
00:42:23,518 --> 00:42:25,895
Please, don't kill me.

555
00:42:25,896 --> 00:42:27,647
- I'm not--
- Hey! Hey!

556
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:31,316
- Please, don't kill me!
- What?

557
00:42:31,317 --> 00:42:34,320
(sobbing)
I'm begging you, please...

558
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:36,907
- (gunshot)
- (baby shrieks)

559
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:43,704
You could have at least waited till
I got her off me. Look at me now! Huh?

560
00:42:43,705 --> 00:42:45,915
You got blood all over my new shoes.

561
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:49,126
I don't give a shit about your shoes.
Stop bitching.

562
00:42:50,336 --> 00:42:51,629
I'm not.

563
00:42:52,964 --> 00:42:53,924
What about her?

564
00:43:00,513 --> 00:43:01,890
Put a bullet in her.

565
00:43:07,687 --> 00:43:10,065
What? The baby's not a witness, man.

566
00:43:10,273 --> 00:43:12,399
I don't give a shit.

567
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,235
- Pablo told us to kill everyone.
- Yeah, but it's a baby.

568
00:43:15,236 --> 00:43:17,488
She won't say shit in court.

569
00:43:18,322 --> 00:43:21,116
If she grows up and talks?

570
00:43:21,117 --> 00:43:24,495
Really? Do you remember
what your mom told you when you were two?

571
00:43:24,704 --> 00:43:30,543
Why is it so fucking difficult
for you to follow Pablo's orders? Huh?

572
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:36,382
(cooing)

573
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:42,097
(baby crying)

574
00:44:01,825 --> 00:44:04,327
(people screaming)

575
00:44:14,129 --> 00:44:15,296
(grunts)

576
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,150
(chickens clucking)

577
00:44:38,402 --> 00:44:39,654
(bullet ricochets)

578
00:44:41,781 --> 00:44:43,240
(yelling)

579
00:44:44,283 --> 00:44:45,785
- (shouts in Spanish)
- (gunshot)

580
00:44:45,994 --> 00:44:48,872
(chatter in Spanish)

581
00:45:13,437 --> 00:45:14,355
(grunts)

582
00:45:28,578 --> 00:45:30,872
(in Spanish, panting)
Drop the gun.

583
00:45:31,664 --> 00:45:33,290
(shouts) Now!

584
00:45:33,917 --> 00:45:34,792
(gun clatters)

585
00:45:40,757 --> 00:45:43,551
You're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

586
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,802
Let him go!

587
00:45:55,105 --> 00:45:56,106
Let him go!

588
00:45:56,313 --> 00:45:58,566
- Put the gun down.
- You put yours down.

589
00:45:59,817 --> 00:46:01,736
I don't want to have to kill you.

590
00:46:03,071 --> 00:46:03,905
I will.

591
00:46:09,702 --> 00:46:11,079
(clicks)

592
00:46:23,007 --> 00:46:25,551
(panting)

593
00:46:28,345 --> 00:46:30,389
- (in English) Fuck.
- (motorcycle idling)

594
00:46:31,306 --> 00:46:33,059
(engine revving)

595
00:46:39,523 --> 00:46:40,650
Fuck!

596
00:46:54,664 --> 00:46:57,959
(baby cooing)

597
00:47:06,425 --> 00:47:09,304
(baby babbling)

598
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,819
Hey.

599
00:47:25,028 --> 00:47:27,864
- Hey...
- (Steve sniffling)

600
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,383
(Gustavo sighs)

601
00:47:49,384 --> 00:47:52,889
(in Spanish)
So those fags want to sit and negotiate.

602
00:47:54,765 --> 00:47:55,892
Well...

603
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,062
we have to spend some time in jail, right?

604
00:48:00,063 --> 00:48:01,856
So what the fuck.

605
00:48:03,233 --> 00:48:05,942
You won, Pablo. They gave in.

606
00:48:05,943 --> 00:48:11,323
But that faggot president has yet
to accept our most important demand

607
00:48:11,324 --> 00:48:12,992
before we turn ourselves in.

608
00:48:13,784 --> 00:48:15,410
Which demand is that?

609
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:22,834
It's been a while
since we've been up here, right?

610
00:48:22,835 --> 00:48:23,878
Yeah.

611
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:29,592
We used to come up here
with our girlfriends and smoke a joint.

612
00:48:31,844 --> 00:48:34,055
What does that have to do with anything?

613
00:48:36,682 --> 00:48:39,851
(Latin guitar music plays)

614
00:48:39,852 --> 00:48:43,480
(Pablo) I know every centimeter
of these mountains.

615
00:48:45,108 --> 00:48:48,902
From here,
we can see anything coming.

616
00:48:48,903 --> 00:48:52,531
And we have enough space
to build whatever we want.

617
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,078
We're going to design it...

618
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:01,207
we're going to build it...

619
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:06,461
and we will be protected
from all our enemies.

620
00:49:08,714 --> 00:49:12,260
- You want to build a jail?
- Not a jail, cousin.

621
00:49:14,345 --> 00:49:15,972
A castle.
