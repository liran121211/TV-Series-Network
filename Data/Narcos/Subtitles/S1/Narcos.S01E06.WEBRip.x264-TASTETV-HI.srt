00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:10,852
<i>who we tracked to Cartagena
through one of our informants.</i>

173
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:20,528
[Gacha in Spanish] Have you heard
of this thing called a computer?

174
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:24,991
Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.
I don't know what it is.

175
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:30,455
[boy] It's a new kind of technology
that's coming out.

176
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:33,708
- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, Dad.

177
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:38,045
Hey, honey.

178
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:43,217
You look very beautiful today.

179
00:14:45,637 --> 00:14:49,933
Relax, baby. Relax.
We don't bite. [chuckles]

180
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:54,938
- Do you need anything else?
- I want you.

181
00:14:55,897 --> 00:14:58,650
- [Gacha] Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.

182
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,488
I want to fuck her.

183
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:07,617
We have more important things
to worry about right now, my son.

184
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:09,368
Understood?

185
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,998
Talk to me. What do you know?

186
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,959
Don Gonzalo,
we have people all over the property.

187
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,376
It's secure.

188
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,172
- We've got a few men in town as well.
- [grunts]

189
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:25,426
Now, what can you tell me
about Medellín?

190
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,763
The same, boss.

191
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:32,934
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc
is out looking for Pablo.

192
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:34,393
[Gacha] Thank you, Navegante.

193
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:37,522
- Here to serve, boss.
- Keep us safe.

194
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,317
Don Freddy.

195
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:47,323
Son... a question.

196
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:51,661
Are we sheep or are we wolves?

197
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,123
- We're wolves.
- We're wolves! Right.

198
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:57,709
I like it.

199
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:04,090
[Navegante in Spanish] They're in
a house outside of Cartagena, right here.

200
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:07,969
Just know there are
a lot of people guarding him.

201
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:13,182
Navegante, you've been
working for Gacha for many years.

202
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:17,186
I'm sure in that time you've
earned way more than we are giving you.

203
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:20,648
So tell me,
why do you want to betray him?

204
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:26,278
That fucker's crazy.

205
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:29,908
He's gonna get us all killed.

206
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:42,461
I don't believe him one bit.

207
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:45,256
What do you care
why he's doing it?

208
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:50,469
Because we have 23 agents with
outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.

209
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:54,724
And he has twice as many men
with brand new weapons.

210
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,517
And frankly...

211
00:16:56,601 --> 00:17:01,022
I'm tired of sending young men
to face certain death.

212
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:03,232
So then we have to be smart.

213
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:07,403
We have to create a trap.

214
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:10,073
If we catch him alive,
he'll give us Escobar.

215
00:17:10,156 --> 00:17:11,657
And the Ochoas.

216
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:15,494
- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a fuck, Javier.

217
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:16,913
I want him dead.

218
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:19,124
He doesn't care about death.

219
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,293
He only fears rotting in jail.

220
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,590
- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.

221
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:32,511
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?

222
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:34,388
These aren't your men.

223
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:36,808
You have no family here to lose.

224
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:39,393
If this goes badly, there will be
more widows and orphans,

225
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:42,647
and I'll have to carry that
on my shoulders.

226
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:47,735
Well...

227
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:50,404
I trust his information.

228
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:55,451
And I trust you.

229
00:17:56,285 --> 00:18:01,248
But if this turns out bad...
it'll be on your conscience.

231

We tagged Poison.

232

Who's this guy?

233
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,610
I don't know, but if Poison
showed his face to pick him up,

234
00:18:29,694 --> 00:18:31,320
he must be really important.

235
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:36,159
[Gustavo in Spanish]
Here's your payment, sir.

236
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:41,914
It'll be taken to the coast of Spain
on a cargo ship.

237
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:45,459
From there, our trucks
will take it to the Basque country.

238
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,462
It's all set up.

239
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:54,552

on the first flight.

240

[Gustavo] What's that?

241
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,729
As far as I know, you and my cousin
have an agreement.

242
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:07,148
The agreement is for this amount.

243
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:08,858
What kind of bullshit is this?

244
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:12,486
5,000 kilos or no deal.

245
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,867
Then there is no deal. Who the fuck
do you think you're talking to?

246
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,999
Forgive my cousin, sir.

247
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:33,007
5,000 it is, then.

248
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,934
[Ana] We shouldn't go.

249

250

You'll be safe there,
far from all of this.

- Nothing is going to happen to me.

00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,932
Are we going to eat, Gustavo?

340
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:18,894
- Some rice?
- [Gustavo] Yes.

341
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:21,480
[sighs]

342
00:25:25,568 --> 00:25:26,944
Thank you.

343
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:29,447
Jaime.

344
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:33,742
Welcome to the family.

345
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:37,413
Thank you, boss.

346
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:43,043
Can't you do anything?

347
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,337
[Gustavo]
No.

348
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:49,550
While we're at war,
we can't do anything.

349
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:53,011
This is bullshit.
People are turning up dead every day

350
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:56,307
and my friends
think my brothers are responsible.

351
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:00,852
Let's talk about something else, baby.

352
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,105
Yes.

353
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,025
All right,
let's talk about running away together.

354
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:09,153
Let's get away while we can.

355
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,446
[chuckles softly]

356
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:14,908
"Let's get away."
Listen to this.

357
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:16,994
[Marina sighs]

358
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:23,750
Why would you run away
with a criminal like me?

359
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:26,962
And why not?

360
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:29,632
[scoffs]

361
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:31,592
I wish it was that easy.

362
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:34,428
- Ah.
- I can't just leave like that.

363
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:36,430
I know.

364
00:26:36,514 --> 00:26:38,974
- You say that because of your wife.
- [sighs]

365
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,519
I don't give a shit about my wife.

366
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:46,607
I'm talking about your other wife, Pablo.
[dry chuckle]

367
00:26:46,691 --> 00:26:48,942
Who is the woman
in that relationship?

368
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,444
You?

369
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:03,040
[Steve] <i>Gacha was always paranoid
when things were quiet.</i>

370
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,377
<i>And now, he began to wonder
about Navegante.</i>

371
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,807
[in Spanish] Hey, doll.

372
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:22,393
What are you doing?

373
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:25,479
I'm married, sir.

374
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:27,606
That's no problem.
I can make you a widow pretty quick.

375
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,108
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.

376
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:32,695
Freddy, leave her alone.
Come here.

377
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:33,820
What's up?

378
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:37,449
The Search Bloc is here,
not in Medellín.

379
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,284
But Navegante said they were over there.

380
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:43,163
Navegante... Navegante is a liar.

381
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:44,790
He wouldn't betray you.

382
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:49,378
Freddy... think, think.

383
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:52,423
Everyone in the world has a price.

384
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,260
[shouting] All right, let's go!

385
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,929
They want war, we'll give them war!

386
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:02,140
[men shouting eagerly in Spanish]

387
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:11,233
[sighs]

388
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:15,738
[Steve] <i>The Spaniard was a name
that got everyone's attention.</i>

389
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:17,864
<i>He was a member of Eta.</i>

390
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,950
<i>Never heard of 'em?</i>

391
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:22,869
<i>They made bomb-making
a goddamn art form.</i>

392
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:30,294
<i>They were a group of supposed
freedom fighters from the Basque country,</i>

393
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,379
<i>trying to secede from Spain.</i>

394
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:37,384
<i>Their specialty was
targeted assassinations of public figures.</i>

395
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:40,011
- [indistinct radio chatter]
- [sirens wailing]

396
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:44,891
<i>Eta was responsible for the assassination
of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco,</i>

397
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,269
<i>returning home from Christmas Mass...</i>

398
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:54,359
<i>and a remote-controlled car bomb that
killed Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.</i>

399
00:28:56,903 --> 00:29:00,449
<i>The man behind those bombs?
You guessed it... the Spaniard.</i>

400
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:06,455
<i>Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez,
a celebrity now, for hire.</i>

401
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,624
<i>Expensive, but the best.</i>

402
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,127
<i>'Cause Pablo only hires the best.</i>

403
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:24,389
<i>That was Pablo's plan,
to blow up Gaviria.</i>

404
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:28,686
<i>The question was,
where, when and how?</i>

405
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,898
[in English] I appreciate your concern,
Madam Ambassador,

406
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:36,902
but canceling our campaign travel
is not an option.

407
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,906
Well, given the new information
that Agent Murphy has uncovered,

408
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,741
I hope you'll reconsider.

409
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:47,037
He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá,
and a dozen other cities.

410
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,955
You are a target in every one.

411
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:53,627
Yes, and... we've done everything
your Secret Service

412
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:56,672
and Spain's Civil Guard
have recommended.

413
00:29:56,755 --> 00:30:00,885
We also have bomb-sniffing dogs
at every campaign stop, so...

414
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:01,927
I think we're good.

415
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:04,388
You think the Spaniard
doesn't know that?

416
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:07,850
Yes, I know.

417
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,811
But tell me, Agent Murphy,
how do you expect him to win the election

418
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:13,898
if he hides like a scared rabbit
behind all this violence?

419
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,566
Tell me, how?

420
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:18,151
How do you expect him to win
if he's dead?

421
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,905
I'm not telling your wife
you died on my watch.

422
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:23,240
This is not your watch, OK?

423
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,038
Thank you, Agent Murphy...
but Eduardo's right.

424
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,291
I'll take my chances.

425
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:41,550
[in Spanish]
His name is Steve Murphy. He's DEA.

426
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,969
I hope you'll pay for this information.

427
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,894
[slow Latin music playing]

428
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:53,520
[sighs]

429
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:57,775
Suárez is talking to the DEA.

430
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,487
You know what you have to do.

431
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,481
[in Spanish] He got away.

432
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,943
They killed the goddamn maid.

433
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:45,489
[man] Colonel!

434
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:50,076
Colonel...

435
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,956
They called from the road block.

436
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:57,668
They have a car stopped
and they're saying the driver's a senator.

437
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:00,253
- Does he have his identification?
- Everything checks out.

438
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:01,839
So what's the problem?

439
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:05,383
They found a machine gun in the trunk.

440
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:07,552
Let's go.

441
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,357
Look at my credentials.

442
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,360
No, I don't know this Gacha person
you're referring to.

443
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:27,155
Why do you have a gun in the trunk?

444
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,115
[chuckles]

445
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:35,080
Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician
in this country carries a weapon?

446
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,874
Please.

447
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:39,877
- It's my bodyguard's.
- Where's your bodyguard?

448
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,088
You're alone in the car, right?

449
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:46,758
Listen to me, officers...

450
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:51,471
if you don't let me go immediately,
you're going to regret it.

451
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:53,473
Uh-huh.

452
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,227
Thank you.

453
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:00,564
- Give us a moment.
- Go on.

454
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,360
[softly] I don't believe him.

455
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,112
I don't either.

456
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,658
He could have bought his credentials.

457
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:15,245
What if it turns out he is a senator?

458
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,081
We'll pay for that.

459
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,626
I can't run that risk.

460
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,545
It's true.

461
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,964
- You can't.
- [chambers round, fires]

462
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,507
[screams]

463
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:32,804
The next one...
goes in your head!

464
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,639
- All right, all right!
- Talk, bitch!

465
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,808
I'll talk, I'll talk!

466
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,313
[in Spanish] I love you, my sweetheart.
I love you.

467
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:45,400
You have a guest.
It's Don Pablo.

468
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:46,526
[knocking]

469
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,946
Hey, Jaime.

470
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,614
- Don Pablo.
- This is your house?

471
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,700
- Your family?
- Yes, sir. Welcome.

472
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:55,077
Tell me about them.

473
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,788
This is my daughter Marcela.

474
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:00,165
- Look at what a cute baby.
- [chuckles]

475
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:02,960
- How proud you must be.
- Of course I am.

476
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,962
Of course.

477
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:09,424
Very soon, they will have the money
to buy everything they want, Jaime.

478
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,051
Thanks a lot, boss.

479
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:13,053
- May I please have a glass of water?
- Of course.

480
00:34:13,137 --> 00:34:14,638
Thank you.

481
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:15,889
- What about you?
- Good, sir.

482
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:18,976
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.

483
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:20,978
Guys.

484
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:24,314
All right, Jaime.

485
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:28,735
This is for you to wear
during your mission.

486
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,403
Thank you, Ma'am.
Very kind.

487
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:32,447
Seriously, Pablo?

488
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,240
Thank you very much.

489
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:36,409
Everything is so beautiful.

490
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:41,206
You have to be very careful,
and get by unnoticed.

491
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:44,501
For sure, sir.
I'm ready to do what you're asking.

492
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,711
All right, then, son.

493
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,254
Sit down.

494
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:54,552
These guys are going to give you
very specific instructions.

495
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:57,681
Tomorrow morning, you're boarding
the plane that is leaving for Cali.

496
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:00,892
We want you to record a conversation.

497
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:03,728
It's very simple,
nothing to worry about.

498
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:06,690
All right.

499
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,989
- How are you feeling?
- I'm... I'm very happy.

500
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:17,909
Thank you very much for the opportunity,
Don Pablo. Seriously. And for the clothes.

501
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,745
Really, for me,
it's an honor to work for you.

502
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:22,497
Thank you very much.

503
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,375
[softly] Don't mention it.

504
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:28,503
OK.

505
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:31,131
Come here, give me a hug.

506
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,592
Thank you, Don Pablo.

507
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,512
Thank you.

508
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:40,682
- Ma'am, have a good night.
- [woman] Take care.

509
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:42,392
Thank you very much.

510
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:44,144
See you later, boys.

511
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:46,437
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.

512
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:48,982
My love, look!

Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.

539
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,592
All she had to do was say yes
