00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:17,728
Not to get personal,

00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:19,522
- "Encounters"?
- Yeah.

are those Colombian cops in Medellín.

No, no, Carrillo's solid.

12
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:32,701
Did anyone have access
to your credentials?

13
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:35,204
Did you drop your wallet?

00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:55,224
A gringo coming in from Miami raises
suspicions. That's how you got made.

23
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:57,851
Don't let it rattle you.
That's what they want.

24
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,688
You probably got a price on your head,
but no one's gonna take the contract.

25
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:01,855
Fucking price on my head?

26
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:06,360
There's a standing bounty
of 350,000 US on any DEA down here,

The "Kiki" Peña was referring to

29
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:17,955
was Kiki Camarena, a DEA agent who went
after the Guadalajara cartel in Mexico.

30
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:20,333
Kiki was captured and tortured.

31
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,419
They skinned his legs,
put a bullet in each limb,

32
00:01:23,503 --> 00:01:26,005

until he died.

- What the fuck were they thinking?

34
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:33,471
They could kill an American
government agent and get away with it?

Uncle Sam doesn't fuck around.
The cocksuckers paid in blood.

Kiki was like Jesus Christ to us.

00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:48,569
He died to save us all.

40
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:51,864
Do not tell Connie that story.

41
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:53,240
I won't.

42
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,743
- But you shouldn't forget it either.
- Why?

43
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,871
This cat is DEA.

If I had known that--

00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:42,219
You need a proper political campaign.

00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:07,202
Well, not in Colombia.
Not in the mid-'80s.

82
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:10,581
As far as Colombians go,
Pablo wasn't a drug dealer at all.

00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:12,750
He was a fucking winner.

As far as Pablo could tell, the doors
to political success were there...

87

and all he had to do was to get to them.

88

And in order to do that,

89
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:34,605
he asked Valeria Velez
to introduce him to Fernando Duque.

90
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,656
Duque was a lawyer and a lobbyist
who represented the New Liberals,

to represent the people.

It gives me great pleasure to invite you

Look, I am not a rich person.
I am a poor person with money.

101
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:19,775
And for that reason,
I think that...

102
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,111
Well, I think that
I understand the people

103
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:25,405
to whom the New Liberalism
wants to give a voice.

104
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:30,077
The party clearly needs to hear
what you have to say, Mr. Escobar.

105
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:34,289

about how you have made your money.

that you will receive your piece.

00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:56,854
- It's not about that--
- Assuming your piece is ten percent,

112
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:58,397
your piece would be what?

113
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:00,941
$300,000 just for you.

114
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:08,281
Does that seem like a sufficient guarantee
for the Justice Minister or what?

115
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:10,784
- Most definitely.
- All right, then.

He has created sources of employment
throughout Medellín.

The people love him,
and he loves the people.

127
00:08:45,903 --> 00:08:48,614
And from a legal point of view,
his money is clean.

128
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:52,409
And according to Forbes Magazine,
he's a drug trafficker.

129
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:56,663

In addition,

a little while until things quiet down?

151
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:13,281
Oh, you're gonna make them quiet down?
You're that good, huh? [scoffs]

152
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:16,952
I'll tell you what. I'll agree to go back
to Miami if you agree to go back, too.

We've had American volunteers.
They come and go.

working in the comuna?

169
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:22,059
That's because you don't know

[speaking Spanish]
Who is the gringa?

173
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:31,610
A child of God, just like you.

174
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:33,486
Hm. Got it.

175
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:36,698
- [up-tempo music playing]
- [men cheering nearby]

176
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:43,538
[speaking Spanish]
Let's see, you are here for a cat?

177
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:47,126
This isn't just any cat.
This is a gringo cat of the DEA.

178
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:49,836
- [in English] What's he saying?
- I'm telling him about the cat.

179
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,506
[in Spanish] And what you want
is for me to find a cat killer.

180
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:57,886
It was the narcos, Suárez.
We don't take this shit lightly.

181
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,056
Your friend is a little crazy.

182
00:12:01,223 --> 00:12:03,475
No hablo español. [in English]
I don't know what you're saying.

183
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:04,935
[in Spanish]
I don't speak English.

184
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:09,439
Get me some information, Suárez.

185
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:11,317
[Suárez]
Look, I don't have enough people

186
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,403
to go through hundreds of hours of chatter
over a fucking cat.

187
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,199
If this was information about the narcos,
yes, my people are interested.

188
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:20,993
But they won't give a fuck about the cat.

189
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,829
- [in English] What is he saying?
- They don't like cats in this country.

190
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:25,247
Tell me about it.

191
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:28,834
[in Spanish] But if you want
to put all my people to work

192
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:33,630
to find out who killed the fucking cat,
that is going to cost you more.

193
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,759
They broke into the house to kill his cat.

194
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:41,429
I think they made him
when he arrived at the airport in Bogotá.

195
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:42,722
Find out.

196
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,270
- [in English] Is that a D-103?
- Yup.

197
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:51,148
[Steve] Let me get this straight.
Gotta pay this cop off for information,

198
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:54,776
- then you gotta get a receipt?
- I gotta get reimbursed.

199
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:59,781
[in Spanish] This gentleman is an employee
of the American Embassy in our country,

200
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:03,952
and he assures me that you gave out his
personal information to certain criminals.

201
00:13:04,786 --> 00:13:06,246
That's not true.

202
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:09,791
These guys killed his cat.

203
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:13,045
Maybe you don't know this,
but the mistreatment of animals

204
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:14,462
is a federal crime.

205
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:17,090
Is this funny to you?

206
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:22,470
They can bring formal charges against you,
and you could lose your job.

207
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:25,349
Do you not need your job, Santiago?

208
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:27,600
Yes, I need it.

209
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:40,906
Mr. Murphy,
do you recognize these men?

210
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,742
[in English] Yeah, you guys
stalled me at the airport

211
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:47,413
so you could take my passport
and copy and scan it, didn't you?

212
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:49,581
- [in Spanish] What?
- May I?

213
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:54,044
You both are being accused
of conspiring against a federal agent

214
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:55,712
of the United States.

215
00:13:56,504 --> 00:14:00,508
The cat is under the jurisdiction
of the American government.

216
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:03,470
And to kill it is the same
as to kill a police dog.

217
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:08,141
This is absurd.

218
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:13,272
Look, I'm a Colombian citizen,
and I know exactly my--

219
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:16,524
You will not disrespect them!

220
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,319
[softly]
Is that clear?

221
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:25,158
If I open my mouth, they kill me...
and they kill my wife.

222
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:27,660
He's having problems with his wife.

223
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:28,912
Shut up!

224
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:31,873
- [mutters] Imbecile.
- OK, gentlemen.

225
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,376
This is quite simple.

226
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:41,800
I can get the phone number of the person
to whom you sent those documents,

227
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:46,554
and I can tell him that you accused him
of being the cat killer.

228
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:48,140
How does that sound?

229
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:56,356
I sent a copy of that passport...

230
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,692
to a man they call...

231
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:02,279
"Poison."

232
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:07,200
[Pablo speaking Spanish]
OK, Poison.

233
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:10,496
You're going to take this money
to Fernando Duque in Bogotá.

234
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:12,372
And this is the address.

235
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:14,791
If they stop you on the road,
just salute the official,

236
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:17,336
give them a little bribe
and continue forward.

237
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:19,379
No violence.

238
00:15:19,463 --> 00:15:21,340
And you call me every two hours.

239
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,758
- Of course, boss. Whatever you say.
- OK, then. No showing off.

240
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:26,261
[shouts]
No showing off!

241
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:30,474
- Nice and simple. Go unnoticed.
- [man] Got it.

242
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:34,144
- [murmuring appreciatively]
- What the fuck are you doing?

243
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:36,896
Getting ready, right?

244
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:40,650
You are meeting up with politicians,
not with gangsters.

245
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:44,779
Aren't they the same thing, boss?

246
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:48,825
Politicians scare easily.

247
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:50,827
You're fine with just a pistol.

248
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,455
Go to it, then.
Go to it, dumbass.

249
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:57,625
[in English] According to CNP wiretaps,
the sicario "Poison"

250
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,170
was recorded saying
he was driving to Bogotá this afternoon.

251
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:01,838
For what purpose,
we don't know.

252
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:04,799
But if we don't respond
to the obvious threat to Agent Murphy,

253
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,385
we're sending the wrong message.

254
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:08,845
Police have the information,
then they should make the arrest.

255
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,097
No. No, if we leave it to them,
someone will sell us out.

256
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:13,808
The narcos have informants
in their department.

257
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:16,562
What Peña's driving at is that
Major Carrillo should man a roadblock.

258
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,397
- We can trust Carrillo.
- I don't have authority

259
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,690
- over the Colombian police.
- All due respect, Ambassador,

260
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,526
but you know where we are.

261
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,361
With enough money,
you can get anything done.

262
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:31,535
Excuse me for saying so...
but this isn't much of a roadblock, is it?

263
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:33,036
Well, if the roadblock is too obvious,

264
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:36,456
Pablo can be tipped off
by a cop or by a passerby, who knows.

265
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,126
Can anybody in this country
keep a secret?

266
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:43,088
I've got a spotter set up
about four kilometers away.

267
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:44,714
He's gonna let us know
when Poison passes.

268
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:47,050
You're gonna question them, right?
Because we need to--

269
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:48,594
Poison's killed three of my men already.

270
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:50,678
If I catch him alive,
you guys can question him here.

271
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:52,931
Then you guys gotta go.

272
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:01,481
[up-tempo music plays on radio]

273
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:03,442
[speaking Spanish]
Hey, hey, hey, hold on, 65?

274
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:04,984
Sixty-five.

275
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,195
Hey, brother, that's a lot.

276
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,905
You sure?

277
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:11,575
I counted every single son of a bitch.

278
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:13,201
All right!

279
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:15,870
Sure, but are you counting
what happened last night?

280
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:17,664
Of course,
that was number 65.

281
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:21,293
Don't bullshit.
I was the one who shot that faggot.

282
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:24,129
- Bullshit.
- [scoffs] Bullshit...

283
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:26,005
if I was the one
who killed that little man.

284
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:29,426
You only shot him
once he was already on the ground, dead.

285
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:31,303
I shot him first.

286
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:34,431
[inaudible chatter]

287
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:38,101
- [knocking on door]
- Come in.

288
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,521
Did you give information about Poison
to the DEA?

289
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:42,814
So?

290
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:45,275
I'm still listening
to their phone conversations,

291
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:47,235
and it's not a shipment of drugs.

292
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,029
They're carrying
three million dollars to Bogotá,

293
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:51,657
and if two guys from the DEA
stop that car,

294
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:53,450
Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.

295
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:57,203
[up-tempo music continues on radio]

296
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:02,167
- You don't have 65, Poi.
- Yes, I do.

297
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:03,543
Eh!

298
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,381
- [tires squealing]
- What are you doing, Gonorrhea?!

299
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:11,050
Look, 65, man!

300
00:18:12,469 --> 00:18:13,928
[mutters in Spanish]

301
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:16,889
Now we're going
to have to wash the car, man!

302
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,184
- [scoffs]
- Son of a bitch.

303
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,311
- [phone ringing]
- Yes?

304
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:23,021
[Suárez] Hi, Pablo.
I have good news for you.

305
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:25,565
I'm going to help you
avoid an enormous loss.

306
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:27,817
And how much is it going to cost me?

307
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,237
Ten percent... $300,000.

308
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:38,328
- How did you find out?
- One of your men.

309
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:41,789
That Poison... he talks too much.

310
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:44,125
You should take his phone away.

311
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:45,460
Five percent.

312
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:54,093
[speaks Spanish]
Suspicious vehicle approaching.

313
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:57,305
[in English] OK. We have visual
confirmation. Four kilometers away.

314
00:18:57,389 --> 00:19:00,016
[overlapping chatter in Spanish]

315
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:05,271
[phone ringing]

316
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:09,150
- Hello?
- [Pablo speaking Spanish] Poison?

317
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:12,111
You bring your fucking mouth
back here immediately!

318
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:14,740
- Yes. I'm sorry, boss.
- Now!

319
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:19,160
The son of a bitch policeman
tapped my phone!

320
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:23,665
- These fags.
- You have a very big mouth, Poison.

321
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:25,333
Pablo is really pissed off.

322
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,462
Shut that mug,
or you will never reach 66, you hear?

323
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:40,390
OK!

324
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:44,227
[men chattering in Spanish]

325
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:49,232
[speaking English]
I'm calling this off. Nobody's coming.

326
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:53,653
- What the fuck has happened here?
- Maybe Poison spotted the spotter.

327
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,321
Either that or Suárez sold you out.

328
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:57,824
[sighs] Yeah, if he did,
he must've had a better offer,

329
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:59,743
and it wasn't a fucking cat.

330
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,124
[speaking Spanish]
He has been called the "Paisa Robin Hood,"

331
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:08,126
but he is much more than that.

332
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:11,879
He is a man to whom the people
mean a great deal. All of us.

333
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:14,882
[Steve] To avoid suspicion
and questioning about his fortune,

334
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:18,261
Pablo ran as an alternate
for Jairo Ortega,

335
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:20,680
a former congressman from Antioquia.

336
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:22,390
[cheers and applause]

337
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,312
It was the first time an alternate was
more important than the main candidate.

338
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:38,030
[speaking Spanish] I am tired... of the
people with power running this country.

339
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:44,245
This is a fight between the people
with power and poor people, weak people.

340
00:20:45,163 --> 00:20:48,124
And this fight must begin here!

341
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:51,252
[cheers and applause]

342
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:57,300
To have power does not mean
that one can abuse the poor.

343
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:58,677
If I am elected...

344
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:03,181
if my friend, Jairo, is elected...

345
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:07,310
those who have never had a voice
will have a voice.

346
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:09,813
[cheers and applause]

347
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:13,441
Those who are hungry will have food.

348
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:16,944
Those who want to learn will have schools.

349
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,656
And those who have dreams

350
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:23,951
will see that there are no limits
to what you can achieve.

351
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:27,997
- [cheering]
- In me, you have a friend

352
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,916
whom you have always had,

353
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:33,628
the friend of today, the friend
of yesterday and the friend of tomorrow.

354
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:36,923
[cheers and applause]

355
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,049
Thank you very much.

356
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:43,304
- [crowd chanting] Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!
- [Pablo] Thank you very much.

357
00:21:48,852 --> 00:21:51,855
My friend, Jairo Ortega!

358
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:54,774
[cheers and applause]

359
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:02,657
[chanting] Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

360
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:03,950
Thank you very much.

361
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,418
- You were marvelous, my love.
- You sure?

362
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:16,379
- Yes.
- [Valeria] Very good, Pablo.

363
00:22:16,588 --> 00:22:19,465
There are a few things we can improve,
but we'll work on them.

364
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:20,466
OK, whatever you say.

365
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,344
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much, Valeria.

366
00:22:23,428 --> 00:22:24,679
Congratulations, ma'am.

367
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,015
Excuse me.

368
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:34,689
[overlapping chatter in Spanish]

369
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:43,155
To vote for Jairo Ortega
is to vote for the one and only Pablo!

370
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:47,911
[coughing, gasping]

371
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:50,747
Tata, what's wrong?

372
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,378
Why does that woman need to know
everything about each step you take?

373
00:22:57,462 --> 00:22:59,213
What are you talking about?

374
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:03,551
- Valeria Velez.
- My love...

375
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:08,306
Tata, she's a newspaper woman,
a reporter who follows the news.

376
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:11,183
And right now, I'm the news.

377
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:16,856
When you win, don't disrespect me
anymore with that bitch.

378
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,692
[softly] Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

379
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:22,278
Slowly... come on.

380
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,947
- [gasps]
- [whispers] Come on.

381
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,245
You are going to be the First Lady
of this country one of these days.

382
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:35,416
Therefore, you are going
to have to learn to deal with the press.

383
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,419
[voice quavering]
That woman is not on your level, Pablo.

384
00:23:38,503 --> 00:23:39,712
She degrades you.

385
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:42,465
Please, don't worry about Valeria.

386
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:46,552
[gasping]

387
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:48,763
[cries out] Pablo!

388
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:52,475
- A car, please!
- [gasping]

389
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:54,686
- A car to the hospital, now!
- [cries out]

390
00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:06,113
You know what, Pablo?

391
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:10,535
To me, it looks like
you are handling things very badly.

392
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:12,912
[sniffs]

393
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:17,542
You need to start thinking more
about your family... and about business.

394
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:20,753
Thing is,
you can't be a politician.

395
00:24:21,546 --> 00:24:22,797
Says who?

396
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:28,053
[sighs] You can't go strutting around
giving things to people

397
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:29,846
simply so they will love you.

398
00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:34,767
We... are bandits.

399
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:44,151
If you run for Congress, find someone else
to manage the laboratories.

400
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,362
[doctor] Señor Escobar?

401
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:50,075
- Come meet your daughter.
- [baby crying]

402
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:58,583
God has blessed us with a girl, Pablo.

403
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:04,089
[whispers] How beautiful.

404
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:10,261
Shh.

405
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:11,888
Shh.

406
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,601
[whispers indistinctly]

407
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:20,063
[camera clicks]

408
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:24,817
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

409
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:29,363
[plane flying overhead]

410
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,037
[Fabio] Pablo is out of control.

411
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:42,501
Mother Mary, man.
What do you want us to do?

412
00:25:42,585 --> 00:25:46,965
You can't give Pablo Escobar a spanking
as though he were some spoiled brat.

413
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:48,257
Oh, no?

414
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:50,259
And why not?

415
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:53,096
Careful with the threat
you cannot execute.

416
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,519
You know what he's doing, right?

417
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:05,608
According to Colombian law,
a congressman has total immunity.

418
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:09,904
Do you think he's protecting himself
while we remain in the drift?

419
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:13,240
I do. He thinks he's that fucking
"Paisa Robin Hood."

420
00:26:13,324 --> 00:26:15,409
So what do we do?

421
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:20,790
Well... we fulfill our duties,
stuffing the ballot box,

422
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:25,920
and later we let Pablo receive
the applause, and take the risk.

423
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:32,051
We continue with our business...
in the shadows, like always.

424
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,513
Carlos, what are the guys saying?

425
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:39,350
I imagine that they're worried, right?

426
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,020
They are not politically conscious,
brother.

427
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:48,359
How can you expect them
to understand your objectives?

428
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,323
You do understand me, brother.

429
00:26:56,534 --> 00:27:00,329
Imagine... a state governed by us.

430
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:03,749
Immunity for everyone, brother.

431
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,711
We, Carlos, belong to the people.

432
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:10,131
I need you to use your influence with the
others to convince them that I am right.

433
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:12,258
If you win,
you don't need to explain anything.

434
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:16,137
And if you lose...
there's nothing to explain.

435
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:17,763
[voice straining] I like that.

436
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:21,142
- Hitler said it.
- Fuck off.

437
00:27:21,226 --> 00:27:22,727
Yes.

438
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,478
He also said that no politician

439
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:27,899
should ever let his picture be taken
in a bathing suit.

440
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:31,027
[giggling]

441
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:37,783
[chuckles]

442
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:43,622
[hysterical laughter]

443
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,504
Well, that's what he said.

444
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:55,176
[sighs] And if I tell you, Carlos...

445
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,928
[sniffing]

446
00:27:57,011 --> 00:28:00,723
that what I want, sincerely...

447
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:03,851
is to help the poor people
of this country...

448
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:06,938
do you believe me or what?

449
00:28:09,274 --> 00:28:11,400
[Steve]
Pablo held most of his campaign rallies

450
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:14,153
in the poorest neighborhoods
of his electoral district.

451
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:17,949
He placed himself on the side
of the poor and the weak

452
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:21,493
in the fight against the oligarchs,
"The Men of Always."

453
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:26,999
And just like any politician,
he made plenty of promises.

454
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:31,420
Only difference was Pablo had the men
and the money to back them up.

455
00:28:32,297 --> 00:28:33,756
[cheering]

456
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:36,425
It was becoming clear to everyone
that Pablo was gonna win.

457
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:37,927
[crowd chanting] Pablo! Pablo!

458
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,264
The only question remaining was...
what to do about that.

459
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:45,559
Gustavo made good on his promise
to quit the labs,

460
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:49,105
- so Pablo put Carlos Lehder in charge.
- [plane flies overhead]

461
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:53,818
With characteristic German efficiency,
he turned the labs into Nazilandia,

462
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:57,404
and production rose 12 percent
in just two short months.

463
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:03,369
Gacha and the Ochoas
adopted a wait-and-see attitude,

464
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:06,497
debating how and when
Pablo would dispose of Jairo Ortega,

465
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,624
his front man,
once the election was over.

466
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:13,545
[speaking Spanish] As soon as the results
come out, Jairo Ortega will resign.

467
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,799
I say he's running toward his death.

468
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:20,845
- [horse snorts]
- [chattering in Spanish]

469
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:24,640
[Steve]
As for us, we were kind of divided.

470
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,726
We cannot have Colombia
become a narco state.

471
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,729
We need to find someone
who can prove this guy is a drug dealer.

472
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:32,690
Let's stop his campaign before it starts.

473
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,483
No one will go on record.

474
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,111
I got a better idea.

475
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:39,697
We let him win.

476
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:41,949
If we put him in the spotlight
and prove he's a trafficker,

477
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,660
the embarrassment alone
might get this country off its ass.

478
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,664
[Steve]
But first, we had to get proof

479
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:51,250
that Pablo was the drug dealer
we knew he was.

480
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,502
So we went to Suárez,

481
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,921
- and gave him a lot of money.
- [speaking Spanish]

482
00:29:57,173 --> 00:30:01,427
First, he told us that Pablo
was arrested for trafficking back in '76,

483
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,181
and then he gave us the name
of a sergeant who could give us the files.

484
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:13,480
Problem was, Suárez was on both the DEA
and the narcos' payroll.

485
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,235
[body thuds]

486
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:23,741
- Sixty-six.
- Bullshit. I shot him first.

487
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,039
[Steve] Then Suárez gave us
the name of the journalist

488
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:32,417
- who reported the arrest...
- [groaning]

489
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,169
...and then the lawyer
who defended Pablo...

490
00:30:35,378 --> 00:30:38,381
and finally, the judge
who signed Pablo's arrest warrant.

491
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:40,216
[overlapping chatter]

492
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,801
We were like the Bermuda Triangle.

493
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,221
You get too close to us,
you disappear.

494
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:47,681
We gotta get something
on this motherfucker.

495
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:50,893
If he was arrested,
there's gotta be a mug shot.

496
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,937
[Javier]
Yeah, well, the file's gone.

497
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:55,481
If there was a mug shot,
then it's gone, too.

498
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,026
If there was a photo,
there's a negative.

499
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:02,029
[Steve] Finally, it dawned on us.

500
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:05,574
We had to find someone
without Suárez's help,

501
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:10,121
and that was the photographer
who had taken Pablo's mug shot years ago.

502
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,666
- [tires screech]
- [man grunting]

503
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,504
We got his negatives, and for safekeeping,
we put him into witness protection.

504
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:24,718
- How long have you had this picture?
- That's classified.

505
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,638
And what am I doing here?

506
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,599
It's not America's role to get involved
in other countries' elections.

507
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,685
Once again, the hand
of the United States remains invisible.

508
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,604
Your party took money from Escobar.

509
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,440
I should think
you'd want to get ahead of this.

510
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:38,816
Everyone took money.

511
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:43,237
By the way, it's all American money,
so why don't you take this to the press?

512
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:46,198
It should come from you.
You're the Minister of Justice.

513
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:52,079
[Steve] Come election day,
sure enough, it was a landslide.

514
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:54,540
The New Liberal party had the candidate

515
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,543
who got the most votes
in all of Antioquia...

516
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:59,753
and his name was Jairo Ortega.

517
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,713
[Ortega speaking Spanish]
Ladies and gentlemen,

518
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:04,883
with clear use of my
mental and physical faculties...

519
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:08,929
I wish to communicate to you my decision

520
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:12,766
to resign from my seat
in the Congress of the Republic...

521
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:16,479
- [crowd murmuring]
- ...for reasons of family and health.

522
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:20,774
But I am completely certain that
my friend Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria

523
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:24,778
is going to continue
our social and political ideas,

524
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:27,698
because Pablo is the voice of the people.

525
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,741
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much, Jairo.

526
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:31,618
- [applause]
- I will give my best effort.

527
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:32,578
Thank you very much.

528
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:35,498
[all singing Colombian national anthem]

529
00:32:57,936 --> 00:32:59,688
[song fades]

530
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:05,777
[thunder rumbles in distance]

531
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:08,447
[Steve]
Imagine you were born in a poor family,

532
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:12,451
in a poor city, in a poor country,

533
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:14,828
and by the time you were 28 years old,

534
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,956
you have so much money
you can't even count it.

535
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:21,043
[thunder continues]

536
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,711
What do you do?

537
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:26,006
- [bells tolling in distance]
- You make your dreams come true.

538
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,051
[rain pattering]

539
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,845
[thunder rumbles]

540
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:35,974
Problem is, nobody can control
the dreams they have.

541
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,065
Especially if you were Pablo Escobar.

542
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:47,653
Especially if you grew up in Colombia.

543
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:55,869
There's a reason magical realism
was born in Colombia.

544
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:00,999
It's a country where
dreams and reality are conflated...

545
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,880
where, in their heads,
people fly as high as Icarus.

546
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,678
But even magical realism has its limits.

547
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:16,265
[speaking Spanish]
Congressman Escobar... Sir!

548
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:17,933
Excuse me.

549
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,561
Allow me to remind you
of the norms of etiquette.

550
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:22,896
You cannot enter the hall
if you don't have a tie.

551
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,109
All right.

552
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:29,570
- What is your name?
- Juan.

553
00:34:29,654 --> 00:34:31,238
Look, Juan...

554
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:35,117
that is a really nice tie.

555
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,661
- My girlfriend gave it to me.
- Really?

556
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,078
Yes.

557
00:34:38,162 --> 00:34:41,748
Well, she's in the history books now.

558
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,418
- Thank you very much, my son.
- Thank you, sir.

559
00:34:44,502 --> 00:34:45,836
- Thank you.
- All right.

560
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,676
[Steve]
And when you get too close to the sun...

561
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:54,803
your dreams may melt away.

562
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:02,019
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

563
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:10,861
[man] Good morning.

564
00:35:12,613 --> 00:35:16,408
This is to inform you that we have
a quorum and may now begin our session.

565
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,790
The Minister of Justice,
Rodrigo Lara Bonilla,

566
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,711
is present here today
to address this honorable Congress.

567
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:30,381
I give the floor to you, Mr. Minister.

568
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:31,882
Thank you very much.

569
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:41,600
Much has been made
of the issue of drug money,

570
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:47,231
"hot money,"
in our national political process.

571
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:52,194
I myself have been accused
of receiving campaign contributions

572
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:55,989
from the narcotics traffickers
who have bought influence in these halls.

573
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:03,581
To this charge, I plead guilty.

574
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:05,999
[crowd murmuring]

575
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:09,836
In my eyes,
the sin of turning a blind eye

576
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,256
is as great as the sin
of outright corruption.

577
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:16,051
We are a nation of the blind,
and in our blindness,

578
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:19,179
we have sold our country
to the highest bidder.

579
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,602
It's time for us to open our eyes
and to see the light.

580
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:29,774
[overlapping murmurs]

581
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:33,360
Congressman Escobar...

582
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:38,741
you stated that your great fortune
was built from a taxi company.

583
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:45,080
This photograph
clearly contradicts your claim.

584
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:48,375
For this reason,
I demand your resignation.

585
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:50,628
You are not welcome in this chamber.

586
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,004
You don't belong here.

587
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,355
[inaudible murmur]

588
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:41,846
Thank you very much, Juan.
Very kind.

589
00:37:41,928 --> 00:37:43,639
[Lara] What interests the narcos

590
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:47,309
isn't just the fall
of the Minister of Justice,

591
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:51,313
but also to impede the strategy of
the government to combat his interests.

592
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:55,275
His two arms: silver or lead.

593
00:37:55,442 --> 00:38:01,573
I want to inform the people
that the Minister of Justice has 24 hours

594
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:05,452
within which to present concrete proof
regarding the insinuations he made

595
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:08,497
the day before yesterday
in the Hall of Representatives.

596
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,751
To the contrary,
I will proceed to denounce him legally

597
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,629
before the authorities
and before the Colombian justice system.

598
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:18,340
[Steve]
Pablo and his lawyers went on the offense,

599
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:20,718
trying to smear Lara with accusations.

600
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:23,804
[Pablo speaking Spanish] I am not looking
for, nor do I long for a confrontation

601
00:38:23,888 --> 00:38:25,013
before the Colombian people.

602
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,600
I look for peace,
I have always preached peace,

603
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:32,604
and have longed for peace and
the prosperity of the Colombian people.

604
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:36,233
[Lara] It's important to realize
that when members of Congress

605
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,361
can be threatened or bought at will,

606
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:43,908
we see with clarity the real dimension
of the drug problem here in Colombia.

607
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,659
[Steve]
But Lara wouldn't back down.

608
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:48,245
He denounced narcos at every opportunity,

609
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:51,248
going after the guys
that we hadn't been able to touch.

610
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,668
He revealed that six
of the country's nine soccer teams

611
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:56,503
were owned by drug traffickers.

612
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:02,008
Gacha the Mexican was forced
to give up ownership of his team,

613
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,595
aptly nicknamed "The Millionaires."

614
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:09,850
Lara denied flying permits
for 57 planes in the Ochoa fleet.

615
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:16,231
He even fined Pablo
for illegal importation

616
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:18,066
of elephants and camels from Africa.

617
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,696
And with the action of one brave man,

618
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,824
Pablo knew his dream
of presidency was over.

619
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:28,076
[Lara speaking Spanish]
What are required are honest men,

620
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,831
men who are able to put themselves
up against drug traffickers,

621
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:39,797
who with complete tranquility buy or kill
any person or government institution

622
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,673
who is against their interests.

623
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:45,677
[Steve] Rodrigo Lara became the most
important political figure in Colombia

624
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,805
with his stand against the narcos.

625
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,348
He just wouldn't stop going after them.

626
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:55,186
His bravery in the face of danger made him
the most wanted man in the country.

627
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:59,566
For his own safety, he was appointed
Colombian ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

628
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:04,195
He was slated to leave in two weeks,
but a lot could happen in two weeks.

629
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,074
I think it might be a good idea
for you to wear this until you leave.

630
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,078
You feel responsible, is that it?

631
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:15,040
Somewhat, yes, sir.

632
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:20,253
Are you so arrogant to think
you had any influence over my actions?

633
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:24,382
That I put my life
and the life of my family at risk

634
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,677
for American policy objectives?

635
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:31,473
Let me assure you, Agent Murphy,
outside of providing me with the picture,

636
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:33,224
you... did nothing.

637
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:37,604
The decision to speak out
was solely mine.

638
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:40,607
And I highly advise you
to wear this vest, sir.

639
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:56,707
I will accept this vest... out of respect
for your concern with my well-being.

640
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,960
But I would advise you one thing
while you remain in Colombia.

641
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:01,378
And what is that?

642
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:05,799
We accept your help,
but never your condescension.

643
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:10,929
When all this is over, Colombians
will be the heroes, and the victims.

644
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:15,350
John Wayne only exists in Hollywood.

645
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,728
Just wear the vest.

646
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:32,826
[speaking Spanish]
Oh, Pablito.

647
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,704
We knew they wouldn't
accept you in that circle.

648
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:40,625
Damned bastards.

649
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:49,426
You're too good for them, Pablito.

650
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,273
[sighs]

651
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,243
This is a fight
that you cannot win, cousin.

652
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:21,041
You need to think more
about your family and the business...

653
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:26,088
and abandon that ridiculousness
once and for all.

654
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:33,178
I will fix it.

655
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:48,401
Due to the vicious lies
and slander cast my way

656
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:51,780
by Minister Lara and his cronies,

657
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:55,492
I've decided to announce my resignation
from Congress of the Republic.

658
00:42:57,744 --> 00:43:01,165
I ran as a representative
for the common man,

659
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:04,126
a voice for those who had no voice,

660
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:07,587
but that has happened
through much of our history.

661
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:11,925
The powerful have conspired to silence me.

662
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:14,469
I dreamt of doing good.

663
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:17,973
Those dreams are over.

664
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:24,896
But make no mistake...
I will not go quietly.

665
00:43:25,897 --> 00:43:27,273
I will fight.

666
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:30,610
"The Men of Always" are mistaken

667
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:34,990
if they think they can defeat
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria!

668
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:47,335
Thank you very much.

669
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:51,339
- Thank you very much.
- [applause continues]

670
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:56,386
- [low conversations]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

671
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:16,531
He didn't wear it.

672
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:19,284
[sighs]

673
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:21,327
Wouldn't have made a difference.

674
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:25,249
[Steve]
Our strategy had gotten a good man killed.

675
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,920
It was the first time
I'd felt guilty about my job.

676
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:34,674
- [chatter in Spanish]
- [men cheering]

677
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:36,676
