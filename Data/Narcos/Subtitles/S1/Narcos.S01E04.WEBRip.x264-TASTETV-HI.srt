There's good that came out of this.

00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,866
Yeah, we used him,
then we got him killed.

No, we didn't kill him... Escobar did.

00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:45,380
[Steve] Peña was right.
There was a silver lining.

12
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,884
One of the sicarios caught
after Lara Bonilla's assassination

13
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,303
confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.

14
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,684
An important politician had been murdered
and everyone knew who did it.

15
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,355
Finally, the Colombian government
had to react.

16
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:06,483
Pablo Escobar was indicted
for the murder of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.

Colombia agreed to the one thing
narcos feared most: extradition.

19
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,412
Now any Colombian
who smuggled drugs to America

20
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,914
could be prosecuted
and jailed in the US,

21
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,499
even if they never
stepped foot on our soil.

22
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,836
This made all the difference in the world.

Grease the right hands and you'd
get a reduced sentence for good behavior.

27
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,558
It was a fucking joke.

28
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,144
Back home,
it was a whole different deal.

extradition became the defining issue

they bought.

93
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,789
But Luis Carlos Galán was neither.

00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,876
And so, unable to buy him
and unable to scare him,

95
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,171
Escobar tried out
that fancy new stationery,

96
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,173
and he wrote Galán a letter.

97
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,970
[in English] "And to conclude, I want
to express my most energetic protest

98
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,766
over the improper interference
of North America

99
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,727
in a way that entails
the most flagrant violation

of the sovereignty of our Motherland."

101
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,565
He's got some balls.

102
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,358
Escobar is shameless.

103
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:26,029
The United States is inclined to support
your bid for the presidency, Mr. Galán.

104
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,157
But even if we indict these narcos
in the United States,

105
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,119
we still can't get them there
without Colombian approval.

106
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,080
We're curious
as to your view on extradition.

107
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,041
My campaign manager,
Dr. Gaviria,

108
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,586
doesn't want me
to stick my foot in my mouth.

109
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:44,673
America wants Pablo Escobar
to prove they're winning a battle,

110
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:47,468
when clearly,
they're losing a war.

111
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,512
I'll do what's best for Colombia.

112
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,892
[in Spanish] If you speak in favor
of extradition, you will be their puppet,

113
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,312
and that will be your death sentence.

114
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:02,650
I don't care about the Americans, but I am
still going to support extradition.

115
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,986
Besides, if the gringos want to take away
all the goddamn killers of this country,

116
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,404
then let them take them.

117
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,989
[Steve]
Since he couldn't get to Galán,

118
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,826
Pablo reached out
to many of the country's judges.

119
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,745
He figured out that a sanctioned law
would do no harm

120
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,955
if no judge was willing to apply it.

121
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,627
"As you pass judgment
on one of our sons

122
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,963
and consider sending him
to his fate in the United States,

123
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,425
know we, the Extraditables,
will pass judgment on you

124
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,094
and bring a sentence far harsher."

125
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,472
The judges were so scared and intimidated

126
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,308
that special court procedures
had to be created.

127
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,853
For the first time
in the history of Colombia,

128
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,814
it was the good guys who
had to hide their faces behind the masks.

129
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,649
[in Spanish] Defendants, please rise.

130
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,196
You've been tried and convicted
of cocaine trafficking.

131
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:56,203
You will immediately be turned over to the
DEA for extradition to the United States.

132
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,623
[Steve] Despite his threats,
many brave men defied him.

133
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:05,253
And true to form,
when the pen failed...

134
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,339
Pablo was always ready with the sword.

135
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,465
[engine starts]

136
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,348
In light of this terrorism,
you'd think that everyone in Colombia

137
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:20,268
would've made catching Escobar
the number one priority, right?

138
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,770
Well, guess again.

139
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,733
Communists. They're the real threat
to the security of this country.

140
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:29,444
All due respect, but Colombian cocaine has
killed more Americans than Soviet troops.

141
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:33,240
We got FARC, we got M-19,
we got EPL, we got ELN,

142
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,868
all supported by the Soviets and Cubans.

143
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:39,705
Sorry, Agent Peña, but our resources
gotta be directed at America's problems,

144
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,082
and you don't get to tell us
what those are.

145
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,086
[Steve]
Communists. Remember them?

146
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:50,591
With Reagan in the White House,
it was hard to forget.

147
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,717
In his words:

148
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,929
They are the focus of evil
in the modern world.

149
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,307
[Steve] The Soviet evil empire
was Reagan's thing, always had been.

150
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,937
In Hollywood, he named some actors
as communist sympathizers.

151
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,022
In Washington,
he created the Reagan Doctrine,

152
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,776
which opposed Soviet-backed communists
all over the world.

153
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,320
Drug traffickers just didn't rate.

154
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,991
You want to turn on the tap
of the richest country in the world,

155
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,242
you'd better be chasing reds.

156
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,829
Ambassador, if the CIA
and the Mil Group provide assets,

157
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,873
the Colombians will get Escobar.

158
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:26,001
We're talking about a huge blow
to the cocaine trade

159
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,712
- and saving thousands of lives...
- Ambassador.

160
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:33,884
The CIA agrees with Mil Group.
Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.

161
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:37,220
He's just a wanted Colombian
drug trafficker, and as such,

162
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:42,267
he is not a direct threat to our country's
strategic interests in South America.

163
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:47,522
The CIA would prefer not to get involved
in local police problems.

164
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,232
Let the Colombians get him.

165
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:53,403
Noonan really thinks
allocating $100,000

166
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,657
- will be enough to go after Escobar.
- Yeah, it's a fucking joke.

167
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,492
That's about what he spends on shoes,
isn't it?

168
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,662
The CNP has zero chance
of capturing him with that bullshit.

169
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,163
So what do we do now?

170
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,749
Use what little we got
to try to even the odds.

171
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:10,420
[Steve] It's true,
the hundred grand wasn't that much.

172
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,256
But delivered into the right hands,
it could make a difference.

173
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,094
There were a lot of good cops in Colombia,
honorable men.

174
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:23,058
But the head of counternarcotics,
General Jaramillo, wasn't one of 'em.

175
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,271
And as such,
he was exactly what we needed.

176
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,025
[in Spanish]
Thank you for seeing me, General.

177
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,734
You're welcome.

178
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:36,404
Listen, I have General Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

179
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:40,868
With all due respect, General Jaramillo...
I propose Horacio Carrillo.

180
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,120
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn't follow anyone.

181
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,040
Well, I don't want him to follow.

182
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,542
I want him to lead.

183
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,632
Go ahead.

184
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,844
Yes, General.

185
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,055
As you wish.

186
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,305
Understood.

187
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,519
What happened, honey?

188
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,396
Things with work.

189
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,690
When will Horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

190
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:15,652
I'm making the chicken he likes,
but he's out with the girlfriend.

191
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,741
Tell me what's wrong.

192
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,660
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

193
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,084
The Ochoas aren't happy at all.

194
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,088
They're saying that since
you've become a wanted man,

195
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,840
bribing the police
has gotten very costly.

196
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,967
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

197
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,053
[Pablo] Hm.

198
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,557
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back, well, then...

199
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,559
I didn't hear them complaining, did I?

200
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,311
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

201
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,231
- and another to kill politicians.
- So what now?

202
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,152
What I would do is increase
the payments to the police, you know?

203
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,528
And most of all, to the top brass.

204
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,489
We're already giving too much money
to those bastards.

205
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,657
[Gustavo] Mm.

206
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,622
Oh, shit. What's that?
Is it snowing or what?

207
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,416
- [birds squawking]
- [Pablo] Egrets from the Himalayas.

208
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,459
[Gustavo chuckles]

209
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,003
It took two years
to train them to stay there.

210
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,173
They cost me a million dollars.

211
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,097
[sighs]

212
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,431
Bastards.

213
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:30,144
Stay in the fucking tree!

214
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,940
[Gustavo laughs]

215
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,739
Seems like you lost that dough,
eh, cousin?

216
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,910
That's your problem, Pablo.

217
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,496
You think that everything
can be controlled,

218
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,082
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

219
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:58,005
OK, OK, OK, Gustavo... OK. [sighs]

220
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,383
[in English] Your English is really good.

221
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,595
Thank you. I took a course
at the University of Antioquia.

222
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,305
How long you been at the comuna?

223
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,474
Just a few weeks.

224
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,102
Is your husband
gonna help us here, too?

225
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,522
I saw him when he dropped you off.
What does he do?

226
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,360
Oh, he's, uh... head of janitorial
services at the US Embassy.

227
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,990
[up-tempo Latin music plays]

228
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,576
- I fucked up.
- How?

229
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,204
Carrillo got the job
just like you wanted.

230
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,413
No, Jaramillo's sending a message.

231
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,169
He's telling me I got his price wrong.

232
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,796
He's setting Carrillo up for failure,
and when he does fail,

233
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,215
he'll fire him for incompetence,

234
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,092
and me and you,
we lose the only cop we can trust.

235
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,553
[women chuckling]

236
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,971
- Hey!
- Hey!

237
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,764
- Sorry I'm late, honey.
- Mm...

238
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,309
Javier, this is my friend, Elisa.

239
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,187
- Javier works with Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

240
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,312
Nice to meet you.

241
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,817
Are you another... janitor at the embassy,
like Steve?

242
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,986
No, actually, I'm CIA.

243
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:06,489
But that's classified,
so don't tell anybody.

244
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:10,118
I'm here to hunt communists
and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.

245
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,913
- The janitor thing, what, that was you?
- Mm.

246
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,165
No, it's just a cover.

247
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,667
- Thank you for being so honest.
- Mm-hm.

248
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,712
Just so you know,
I'm a communist guerrillera.

249
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,839
[all chuckling]

250
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,007
Perfect.

251
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,676
[Steve] If we had known at the time
she was telling the truth...

252
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,304
we probably wouldn't have cared.

253
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,681
We cared about Pablo Escobar.

254
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,851
And catching him...
wasn't gonna be easy.

255
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,979
He had better resources
and better information.

256
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,523
And at the time,
he owned over 800 homes and fincas,

257
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,610
surrounded by dozens of sicarios
willing to die for him.

258
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,281
And cops...
he owned a lot of them, too.

259
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,531
But not all of them.

260
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,078
Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be
at his finca called El Bizcocho tomorrow.

261
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,705
The only way to surprise him
is an aerial assault.

262
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,041
Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.

263
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,753
Then we need to figure out
where he's hiding today.

264
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,382
Trapped a little bird.

265
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,094
And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.

266
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:11,221
Jesus.

267
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,146
Just remember that you wanted all in.

268
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,231
[Carrillo in Spanish]
Hand me that coffee.

269
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,608
[man speaks indistinctly in Spanish]

270
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,611
[soft gasp]

271
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,989
[cup clatters]

272
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,116
[man gasps sharply, coughs]

273
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,495
[in English] He already gave up
the name of three fincas,

274
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,831
but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.

275
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,960
[in Spanish] But you do know
where he is hiding, don't you?

276
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,066
[in Spanish] Look, little brother,

277
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,403
I know it scares the shit out of you
that Pablo will kill you.

278
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,324
But I will also kill you.

279
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,492
And very slowly.

280
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,705
[stammers weakly]
Pablo is going to kill me more slowly.

281
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:23,418
Well, then, you should pray we find him,
and quickly.

282
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,299
[Steve] We knew that Escobar would
get a heads-up the second we moved out,

283
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,927
but there was a small part of me
that thought, in his arrogance,

284
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,138
he would stand and fight.

285
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,682
Or maybe we just wanted
to send him a message.

286
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,642
[in Spanish] Boss!

287
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,727
Poison...

288
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,103
Boss!

289
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,358
They were headed for El Bizcocho,
but they got off the main highway.

290
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,194
- They're already on their way here.
- How far are they?

291
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,528
Two hours, boss.

292
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,074
Round up the guys,
and tell them to get ready.

293
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,076
- We're leaving.
- All right.

294
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,164
We have to go.

295
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,458
Go where?

296
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,252
The police are coming.

297
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,587
- But Pablo, I've been cooking for hours.
- I'm sorry, my love,

298
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,549
- but we need to leave now.
- What about our things? Our clothes?

299
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,509
We'll buy new ones later,
won't we?

300
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,970
[Pablo sighs]

301
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,639
[softly] I'm sorry.

302
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,476
Do you hear me complaining?

303
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:29,525
As long as you're with us, Pablo,
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.

304
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,537
- Bring all of the boxes here.
- [man] Yes, sir.

305
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,956
- Cangrejo!
- Yes?

306
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,209
Go to Pablo's room
and see if anything is in there.

307
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,585
- Efrain!
- Yeah?

308
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,130
The two blue notebooks
are the only ones I'm taking.

309
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,761
Search the whole house to make sure
that not a single loose document remains.

310
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,513
[man] Yes, sir!

311
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,598
[men chatter in Spanish]

312
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,407
What's wrong, Gustavo?

313
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,868
You fucked us, Pablo.

314
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,498
Not only you and me.

315
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,207
You fucked the whole family.

316
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,923
But of course, since you needed
to present yourself to Congress...

317
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,678
since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country,

318
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,097
the rest of us get screwed,
isn't that right?

319
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,771
But what the fuck...

320
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,608
a man only dies once, right?

321
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:56,988
[softly] Come here.

322
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,163
[whispers] My brother.

323
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,791
[Pablo] I'm going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on, come on.

324
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,962
- [engine powering]
- There we go.

325
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,100
[Steve] I like to think
that as Pablo looked down

326
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,644
on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time,

327
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:33,107
he got our message...
and I hope it really pissed him off.

328
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:37,278
You may have 800 houses, my friend,
but none of them is home.

329
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,448
We will keep you on the run
for the rest of your life,

330
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,493
or until we catch you...
or kill you.

331
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,079
From now on,
nowhere is safe.

332
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,789
[overlapping chatter in Spanish]

333
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,517
[Steve] The only people to detain
were the maids and the gardeners

334
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,936
while we searched the finca
from top to bottom.

335
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:15,233
The dirt-poor cops
were astounded by the luxury.

336
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:20,029
Hey, if you're risking your life
for $22 a week... you'd pig out, too.

337
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:24,033
There's an old saying in law enforcement:

338
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,911
"The bad guys
need to get lucky every time.

339
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,497
The good guys
just need to get lucky once."

340
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,670
And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit,
I got very lucky.

341
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:40,467
The address I found led us to a
nondescript building in downtown Medellín.

342
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,303
We raided it,
and guess who we found?

343
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,555
Blackbeard.

344
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:49,016
Pablo's number one accountant
and keeper of all secrets.

345
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,604
In custody,
he would describe a cocaine empire

346
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:56,524
that was bringing in $60 million a day.

347
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,402
Pablo was bigger than General Motors.

348
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:03,823
The mountain of evidence filled
an entire room in the Palace of Justice,

349
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,117
home of Colombia's supreme court,

350
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,744
the only place
thought safe enough to store it.

351
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:14,542
We had enough evidence
to put him away for 100 lifetimes.

352
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,002
[whispers in Spanish] Fuck.

353
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,797
[whispers in English] Fuck.

354
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,924
- What's up?
- Jaramillo's running the show.

355
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,177
He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.

356
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,596
He's not letting us
make any copies of anything.

357
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,806
Javi, there's some good stuff in here,
stuff we can use.

358
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,058
[Javier]
None of it can leave the room.

359
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,936
The narcos have been
paying some guy named Ellis McPickle

360
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,856
- to run coke all over the place.
- Ellis McPickle?

361
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,609
[Steve]
I'm assuming that it's an alias.

362
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:46,824
Take 'em.

363
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,995
- What?
- Just stuff 'em down your pants.

364
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,039
What are you talking about?

365
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,583
[whispers] Do you want to catch Pablo
or not? [clears throat]

366
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,422
- [softly] Why me?
- [whispers] Because they'll suspect me.

367
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,966
- They won't suspect you.
- What if they search me?

368
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,760
They're not gonna
search a white boy, OK?

369
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,095
- You're a guest in their country.
- Guests don't steal.

370
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,263
Just do it.

371
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:13,893
Sometimes you gotta do bad things
to catch bad people.

372
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,021
- [Steve] And sometimes, bad people...
- Señor.

373
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,356
...help you do good things.

374
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,984
[Javier in Spanish] These are
from the narcos' account in Miami.

375
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:26,113
A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis McPickle."

376
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:28,658
Yes.

377
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:33,788
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

378
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,373
Obviously, it's an alias.

379
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:39,377
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis McPickle." [soft chuckle]

380
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,713
Because he's not Colombian.

381
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:47,301
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

382
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,136
- A gringo?
- Mm-hm.

383
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:53,307
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

384
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:57,937
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "McPickle."

385
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,067
Suarez, do you ever worry
what will happen to you

386
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,446
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

387
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:10,157
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah?

388
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,869
Then prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

389
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,663
[sighs]

390
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:19,751
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

391
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:23,713
But maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

392
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:29,051
[chats indistinctly in Spanish, chuckles]

393
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,179
Wha... What the fuck is this?

394
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,889
This is me giving you homework.

395
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,350
Former CIA pilot
flying coke for the narcos.

396
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,185
And I need you to find out who it is.

397
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:41,147
First off, I don't fucking work for you,
Murphy, you hear me?

398
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,108
- So don't come in here thinking that...
- Is that Barry Seal?

399
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,655
What's he up to these days?

400
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,030
Barry Seal.

401
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,416
[Steve] Barry Seal, a good ol'
Southern boy who loved college football,

402
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,169
mind-altering chemicals,
and pussy...

403
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,797
which made him perfect CIA material.

404
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,092
But his expensive lifestyle
also made him perfect narco material.

405
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,887
Finding Barry was easy.

406
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,056
We just had to stake out
his favorite whorehouse.

407
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,601
It just so happened
to be Peña's favorite, too.

408
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,270
A friend of mine told me about this place.
I've never been here before.

409
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,772
[laughing]

410
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,691
No, I'm serious.

411
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,067
[Steve]
Look.

412
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:30,363
[Javier] Oh, my God.
That's Freckles. I know her.

413
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,906
[in Spanish] Until next time.

414
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,412
- [in English] Goddamn, is that Barry?
- Or should we say McPickle?

415
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:41,916
Come on, we got you a ride
waiting over here.

416
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,668
[in Spanish] Hi, Vanessa.

417
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,380
[in English] It's fun to say, though,
ain't it? "McPickle"?

418
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,091
[Javier clears throat]

419
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:53,803
Have a seat, Barry.

420
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:02,520
You seem awful relaxed for someone
who's facing life in the clink.

421
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,314
- Well, you guys ain't got shit.
- [Javier chuckles]

422
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:10,152
We got records from Escobar listing
shipments from Medellín to Louisiana

423
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,238
- to the tune of 500 tons?
- Yeah.

424
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:17,034
Yeah? Well, let's see
if that holds up in court, huh?

425
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,830
The funny thing is you can't make
a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana

426
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:22,623
without making a refueling stop.

427
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:26,043
Yeah, according to the records,
you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

428
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:28,671
The manifests don't lie.

429
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:32,884
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist
countries with or without cocaine,

430
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,637
that would be considered treason
by the US Justice Department, wouldn't it?

431
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:40,600
Well, damn... [chuckles]
you guys are good.

432
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,017
Communist sympathizer.

433
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,103
We're gonna wrap you up
in a big, red bow

434
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,980
and drop you right off
at Reagan's doorstep.

435
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,566
Using Cuba and Nicaragua
as refueling stops for coke shipments,

436
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,193
that's treason and trafficking.

437
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,654
What's that,
two life sentences for the price of one?

438
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:55,865
[Javier] That's right.

439
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:02,997
Well... see,
I figured this day might come.

440
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:06,125
Why don't you uncuff me, boys.
I got something to show you.

441
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,334
Yeah? What's that?

442
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:10,129
It's what I call
a "get out of jail free" card.

443
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:13,591
Y'all gonna wanna see this.
Come on, uncuff me.

444
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,176
[Steve]
What Barry had was a picture of Escobar

445
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,222
loading cocaine on a tarmac
in Nicaragua. Why does that matter?

446
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:24,351
'Cause at the time, Nicaragua was
governed by the communist Sandinistas,

447
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:27,229
who were letting Escobar
use their country as a landing strip

448
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:30,024
for cocaine shipments to the US.

449
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:34,153
Colombian cocaine coming through
a communist country and into America?

450
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,571
I couldn't have made that up.

451
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,531
- [Javier] Holy shit.
- [Steve] It was too good.

452
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:40,409
- Gotta turn this over to the ambassador.
- Wait, wait, wait. No.

453
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:43,245
This leaks wide and Barry Seal
is a dead man. We gotta be careful.

454
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:46,791
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag
who's trafficked over 500 tons?

455
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,043
I have a code of ethics
when it comes to informants.

456
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:52,588
But not when it comes
to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

457
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,924
- You know, I wouldn't judge Carrillo.
- Why is that?

458
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,511
You had a partner killed.
He's had a dozen.

459
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:11,148
[Steve] I always admired
Peña's commitment to informants,

460
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,318
but frankly,
Barry Seal wasn't an informant.

461
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,278
He was just another busted trafficker

462
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,949
who ratted on the guys
he worked with... a snitch.

463
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,661
If I could use
the narco-communist connection

464
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:26,914
to get the resources we needed,
then fuck him.

465
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,333
Strange bedfellows, indeed.

466
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:33,170
You have single-handedly
exposed a narco-communist connection.

467
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,339
Washington is gonna go crazy.

468
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,842
Thank you, Ambassador.

469
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,262
This has to be highly classified
for the safety of the informant.

470
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,472
Of course.

471
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:46,767
Thank you.

472
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:53,774
[Steve] In Washington, "highly classified"
didn't carry much water.

473
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:57,862
Especially when a Marine colonel named
Oliver North got his hands on the picture.

474
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,865
I know every American parent
concerned about the drug problem

475
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:05,369
will be outraged to learn that
top Nicaraguan government officials

476
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,622
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.

477
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:11,959
This picture shows Federico Vaughan,

478
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:15,880
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes
who rule Nicaragua,

479
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:20,927
loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics
bound for the United States.

480
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:26,223
No, there seems to be no crime
to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.

481
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,560
[Steve]
Being a rat is a dangerous business,

482
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,771
and Escobar's reach was long.

483
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:34,481
Barry Seal refused federal protection...

484
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,567
- [automatic gunfire]
- [grunts]

485
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,695
...and met his end
in a parking lot in Baton Rouge.

486
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,196
Whoops.

487
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,706
Motherfucker!
I told you we had to be careful.

488
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,918
- You got Barry Seal killed.
- Peña, if he wanted a long life,

489
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,754
- he should've worked at Kodak.
- You're responsible for his death.

490
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:59,590
I didn't kill him, Escobar did.

491
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,885
Now we can go after that motherfucker.

492
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,138
Look on the bright side, man.

493
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,100
[Steve]
From then on, according to Reagan,

494
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:12,645
fighting the narcos
was the same as fighting the commies.

495
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:16,356
We got a tidal wave of money
and all the resources we needed.

496
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,401
The US Southern Command in Panama
sent us a care package:

497
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,906
planes, helicopters,
you fucking name it. Everything.

498
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:33,124
Our resources and intel helped the
Colombians raid labs all over the country

499
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:37,753
and burn 'em straight to the ground,
seizing over a billion dollars in coke.

500
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:40,881
We were kicking ass,
and the narcos were feeling it.

501
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:44,426
The price of cocaine in Miami
was skyrocketing.

502
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:48,806
Despite all this, we'd yet
to net one of the Medellín kingpins...

503
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:52,601
till we put a tracking device
on a Colombian-bound shipment of ether,

504
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,436
the essential ingredient
in cocaine processing.

505
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:55,562
Got it!

506
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:59,817
[Steve] The barrel that we tracked
brought us to Tranquilandia,

507
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:03,362
Medellín's biggest processing lab,
and we hit it hard.

508
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,782
The ensuing gun battle
cost dozens of men...

509
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,618
but in the end,
it got us our biggest victory to date,

510
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:13,998
the first of the Medellín kingpins:
Carlos Lehder.

511
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:17,168
[in English]
In my tent is a bag with $50,000...

512
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,253
ten times this if you give me one hour.

513
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,757
[in Spanish] There's no way out,
Carlitos. You're going to Disneyland.

514
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,889
[Steve] Lehder was immediately
extradited to the States,

515
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:35,435
where a federal court
sentenced him to life... plus 135 years.

516
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:40,649
Extradition worked.
Carlos will die in an American jail.

517
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:45,779
And no one savored this victory
more than the Colombians.

518
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:49,200
For anti-narco candidate
Luis Carlos Galán,

519
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:53,537
it would provide him the momentum
he needed to propel him to the presidency.

520
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,956
Extradition would become his battle cry.

521
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,958
[man in Spanish] Gentlemen?

522
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,003
Thank you.

523
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:06,092
[Steve] And for the narcos,
this was a declaration of war.

524
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,304
[Duque in Spanish]
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

525
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,600
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

526
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:18,353
against the legality of extradition.

527
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:23,358
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

528
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,028
Can we buy someone in that court?

529
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,198
Unfortunately, no.

530
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:32,743
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

531
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,830
Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in our favor.

532
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:39,708
Brother... even after he's dead,

533
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:43,170
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

534
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:45,172
He's totally fucked.

535
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,882
This is gringo bullshit.

536
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:50,761
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

537
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,097
We're next, aren't we?

538
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,182
You're right.

539
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:57,184
Pablito?

540
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:58,769
Do you have an answer or what?

541
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:08,403
Well... in my opinion, a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

542
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:12,658
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

543
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,328
Carlos was one of us.

544
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:22,209
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

545
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,544
But remember,
there's something they want more than us.

546
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,756
So, brothers...

547
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,843
it's time to give them what they want,
isn't it?

548
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:31,969
[murmurs of approval]

549
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:35,722
[Ivan in Spanish] I didn't think our paths
would cross again.

550
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:39,101
What you want isn't going to be easy.
It's very risky.

551
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:43,563
It's going to require weapons and men.
There will be casualties.

552
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:48,944
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

553
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,739
Two million US dollars.

554
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,450
It's very dangerous.

555
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,414
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice...

556
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,336
and it goes without saying
that it will dangerous, right?

557
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,511
[knocking at door]

558
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,098
[Pablo] But for us, brother...

559
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:22,686
it is our duty to fight to the very end.

560
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:27,400
We have an historical obligation.

561
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:31,362
- We can't forget that.
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]

562
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,072
[Elisa] I'm his girlfriend.

563
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,248
Meet Pablo Escobar.

564
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,335
Miss.

565
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:49,088
- OK.
- We have a deal.

566
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,589
All right, then.

567
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:53,842
We were just leaving.

568
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,261
Good night.

569
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,895
What the hell is this?

570
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,106
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

571
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,901
We made a deal...
obviously for money.

572
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,695
In exchange for what?

573
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:18,325
Unless you are willing to be part of it,
I cannot say.

574
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:25,416
It's a partnership,
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

575
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:29,878
I fight for the people...
not for drug traffickers.

576
00:35:45,436 --> 00:35:46,812
[in English] Connie?

577
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,730
Elisa? What's going on?

578
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,066
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

579
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,152
You told me your husband
works at the embassy.

580
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:54,445
Yeah.

581
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,280
I need you to speak with him
and warn him.

582
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:57,572
About what?

583
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:01,743
Pablo Escobar is planning something
with a communist group called the M-19.

584
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,870
I don't know what it is,
but I know it's gonna be bad.

585
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,957
Wait, Pablo Escobar?
How do you know anything about Escobar?

586
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:10,585
I... I just know.
You need to warn him...

587
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,129
and you need to hide me.

588
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:15,048
OK. Come on.

589
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,555
Steve's already at work,
but Javi lives downstairs.

590
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,898
I just hope he's here.

591
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,400
[Javier] I am.

592
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,945
- Well, what have we here?
- I'll explain later.

593
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,531
I'll be right back. Go.

594
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,204
- [Connie] She told me that Escobar...
- Slow down.

595
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:48,248
...hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks
they're gonna do something terrible.

596
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,667
- Slow down.
- Escobar is using members of M-19.

597
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,170
- Say that again?
- Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.

598
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,421
Escobar and M-19?

599
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:56,798
She didn't tell me any details,
just that it would be bad.

600
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,800
No... that doesn't make any sense.

601
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,678
She asked me to hide her,
so I took her to Javi's apartment.

602
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,804
OK. All right.

603
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,224
[sighs, clears throat]

604
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:17,194
- Agent Murphy!
- All right.

605
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:20,531
Ambassador, I got information
with Escobar and M-19. I think they're...

606
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,242
- [reporter] ...supreme court building.
- Oh, my God.

607
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,245
[Steve] "Oh, my God" is right.

608
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:30,790
Financed by Escobar, the M-19 guerrillas
stormed the Palace of Justice

609
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,377
and occupied the supreme court.

610
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:36,671
They took over 100 hostages
and made a bunch of demands

611
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:40,426
about the redistribution of wealth
and an end to injustice and tyranny...

612
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:42,177
but it was all bullshit.

613
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,513
The military attacked.

614
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,473
Dozens of lives
were lost in the carnage,

615
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,018
including half of
Colombia's supreme court justices.

616
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,646
Most of the M-19 were killed.

617
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:56,900
Some escaped... but not before
accomplishing their true goal:

618
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:04,283
setting fire to the room that contained
600,000 pages of evidence against Escobar.

619
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:08,036
The entire case against him
turned to ash.

620
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,628
In the United States,
the Mafia makes witnesses disappear

621
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,712
so they can't testify in court.

622
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:23,176
In Colombia, Pablo Escobar
made the whole court disappear.

623
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:29,516
[reporter] The fires set by guerrillas
earlier in the day grew even stronger

624
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,144
as cannon shells exploded inside.

625
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,354
[loud knock at door]

626
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,732
[pounding at door]

627
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,487
- Where is she?
- Well, come on in.

628
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:44,906
You, up! Who in the fuck is she
and why is the military after her?

629
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,283
Put the gun away.

630
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,452
Put it away.

631
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,664
She told me who she is.
Put the gun away.

632
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,915
- Can I say something?
- No, you may not.

633
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:57,544
Murphy... calm down.

634
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,256
I have no idea
why you'd get yourself involved in this.

635
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,509
Your wife brought her to me.

636
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,929
I appreciate you putting yourself
out there for my wife, I truly do,

637
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,056
but why are we risking
our whole careers over this woman?

638
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,059
Because she can prove
that Pablo was behind the palace siege.

639
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,316
If she can tie Escobar to the siege,
I say we bring her in.

640
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,984
Well, she's M-19.

641
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,445
Noonan would have to turn her over
to the Colombian military

642
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:24,779
and then she gets disappeared.

643
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,115
I'd like to avoid
another Barry Seal situation.

644
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,326
So we're gonna
harbor a communist fugitive?

645
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,745
Look, all she did was warn us.

646
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,289
She's not on anybody's radar.

647
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,458
She's not involved in anything.

648
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,466
The red X's you see in these pictures
indicate M-19 revolutionaries

649
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,968
terminated by
the Colombian Special Forces.

650
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:51,097
The remaining individuals you see
are fugitives.

651
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,808
Folks, this is more complicated
than what it seems.

652
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:57,396
This was Escobar, classic.
He's cut a deal with M-19.

653
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:01,233
Next you'll tell us
Escobar sank the Titanic.

654
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,444
Was it coincidence the extradition
evidence against him was destroyed?

655
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,863
He doesn't hold grudges,
not if it suits his purposes.

656
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:10,867
- How do you know he cut a deal?
- We have a confidential informant.

657
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,495
You willing to identify this informant,
Agent Peña?

658
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:17,290
- No, I am not.
- Needless to say...

659
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:20,960
Southern Command has rescinded
its offer of resources to the DEA

660
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,171
in light of this communist aggression.

661
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,131
We need to target the M-19 leadership:

662
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,176
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres
and Elisa Alvarez.

663
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,732
[low murmurs in Spanish]

664
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:51,491
[in Spanish]
They're looking for us everywhere.

665
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:53,535
What did you expect?

666
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,579
That it would be any different?

667
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:02,127
You did a very good job.

668
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:19,394
You can't imagine how much
this is going to help our cause.

669
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:22,648
No, brother.
The truth is, you helped mine.

670
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:27,360
You, Ivan...

671
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:31,698
gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.

672
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:36,244
The same one that freed this country.

673
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,836
Now it belongs to you.

674
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:53,762
With it, you will continue the fight...
to free this country.

675
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,934
I promise you,
I will continue the fight.

676
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,103
You earned it, brother.

677
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:05,398
As for me...

678
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,735
I'll be in Panama until this blows over.

679
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,279
We are also...

680
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:17,786
Make sure you grab the briefcase.

681
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:21,164
And the fucking sword.
