1
00:00:02,151 --> 00:00:03,662
Let's see.

2
00:00:03,686 --> 00:00:06,798
Ooh, yeah.

3
00:00:06,822 --> 00:00:08,466
I'll take the clips.

4
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:14,406
You're all set.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,675
Finally.

6
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,810
Dr. Tony, I think
it's fair to say

7
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:20,946
you and I have had
our ups and downs.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,815
I don't know who encouraged you
into this damn field,

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,552
but you're a terrible
orthodontist, sir.

10
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:28,420
Well, I'm very sorry
to hear that.

11
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:29,888
Obviously, my mother meant well,

12
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:31,757
but didn't do her due diligence.

13
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:35,160
Seven years is a long time
to wear braces, sir.

14
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:37,495
I've watched
your damn kids grow up,

15
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:38,830
and they're the only reason

16
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:40,632
I'm not writing you
a bad Yelp review.

17
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:43,435
But thankfully,
my life begins today,

18
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:45,059
despite your ass.

19
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:49,375
Alright, Chad.
That's enough. Thanks.

20
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,232
My lollipop, please.

21
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,647
Move, Tony.

22

23
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:21,740
There he is!

24
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:24,009
Well, hello, hello,
Mr. Freshman!

25
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,478
Are you excited to show people
your new mouth?

26
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:28,080
Yep, pretty huge day for me.

27
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:31,016
I think people will finally
see me for who I really am.

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,351
Are we sure that's
a good thing? Die.

29
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,087
I have a little something I want
to talk to you about, Chad,

30
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:36,622
but it can wait
until after school.

31
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:37,823
Mom's dating someone.

32
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,625
Or we can do it now.

33
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,827
You're dating someone
behind Dad's back?

34
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,896
That's how divorce works.
Yes, I am seeing someone.

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,832
We don't need to get
into the details right now.

36
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,834
He's Muslim. His name's Ikrimah.

37
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,236
Niki, stay out of
my Match.com profile.

38
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,972
I told you, your account
needs more thirst traps.

39
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:56,041
And I told you
I don't know what that is.

40
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:58,510
Fantastic.
I love the name Ikrimah.

41
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,045
It means "female pigeon."

42
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:03,715
What the dick are we even
talking about right now? Hey!

43
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:05,183
You're dating a Muslim guy?

44
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:07,586
Chad, you do realize
we're technically Muslim.

45
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,188
Yeah, we're Muslim enough.
We don't need people thinking

46
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:11,657
that's, like, our whole thing.

47
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:13,525
What is your problem
with our heritage?

48
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:15,327
I'm embarrassed by it
and I'd like to fit in.

49
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,930
I've made that
<i>very</i> clear to you.

50
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:19,597
If you wanted us
to be so Muslim,

51
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:22,601
you should've raised us
in freakin' Ramalaladadan.

52
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,936
Where?

53
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,271
You're just mad
that you're a late bloomer

54
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,139
and Mom's getting more action
than you.

55
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:28,340
Niki, no offense,

56
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:29,541
but you are a whore.

57
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:33,611
Chad! I said no offense! God.

58
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:35,881
Alright,let's go over this again.

59
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,083
I won't mention to anyone
your braces came off.

60
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:41,287
Yes, just let them discover
it organically, okay?

61
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,556
Let them just kinda
find that joy on their own.

62
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,757
Got it.

63
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,759
Good, 'cause today is important.

64
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:50,362
Alright, we can't have
another junior high situation.

65
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:51,697
I loved junior high.

66
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,166
Peter, you were voted
most likely to be kidnapped.

67
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,234
That was cool.
That was not cool.

68
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:58,103
Okay? We can't be
losers anymore.

69
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:01,106
We don't have any friends.
We never talk to girls.

70
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,641
We didn't go to a single party
this summer.

71
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:05,110
We had that party at my house.

72
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:06,778
That was a brunch, Peter!

73
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:08,981
That your mom had for your aunt!

74
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,249
And you came late.
I was just sitting

75
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:14,119
in a living room with a bunch
of middle-aged ladies.

76
00:03:14,143 --> 00:03:16,722
I-I actually think
it was a baby shower.

77
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:17,923
I think it was, yeah.

78
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,391
This is what I'm talking about!

79
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:20,859
You need to dream bigger.

80
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:22,728
Okay, today's the first day
of high school,

81
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,462
and I want to be popular.

82
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:25,864
Why?

83
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:28,356
Because fitting in rocks.

84
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:36,342
Oh! My body... My body is stuck.

85
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:39,878
Hey, I'm... I'm not
entirely in the bus yet.

86
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:48,020
Hey, Denise. How was your break?

87
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:50,022
You still have
chronic fatigue syndrome?

88
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:52,758
It's chronic, so, yeah.

89
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:54,360
That sucks so hard.

90
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,161
If it makes you feel better,

91
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:59,320
a lot of people on the Internet
say it's not even real.

92
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,126
Alright, let's do this!

93
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,985
Hey! You can't do that in here.

94
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,254
It's actually a USB drive.

95
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:23,655
Oh... kay...

96
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:31,463
Don't do that.

97
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:33,265
I'm very sorry.

98
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:43,409
Why the hell would you do that?

99
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:44,943
What... What's up?

100
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,544
You hit our bottle, dude.

101
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,837
Derek's all pissed.

102
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:55,287
How do you know my name?
Like, who are you?

103
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:57,111
I-I'm Chad.

104
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:00,626
My name's Chad.

105
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,894
Raul: That kid's disrespectful.

106
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,162
Are you okay?

107
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:05,631
Why did you let me
do all of that?

108
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:08,434
Get your butts in a seat!

109
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,992
We're low on desks, folks.

110
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:23,249
What is happening? Sit.

111
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:24,916
Is this...

112
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,786
Am I supposed to sit like this?

113
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,123
Alright, roll call, let's go!

114
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:32,524
Fereydoon Amani!

115
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:33,725
It's Chad!

116
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:35,527
I legally changed it to Chad.

117
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,263
Can you not look at me?

118
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:39,865
Yeah, I was gonna look
over here.

119
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,134
James Barry.
Here.

120
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:44,270
Hannah S. Clifton.
Here.

121
00:06:03,513 --> 00:06:04,890
When was that?

122
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:07,025
It was in August. No!

123
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:08,894
Yeah. Geez.

124
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:11,163
You guys have a good summer?

125
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:14,166
What? I was just
asking about summer.

126
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,035
'Cause she said something
about August, and I was like,

127
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:19,638
"Oh, they're talking
about summer."

128
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,239
I'm Chad.

129
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:23,509
Who are you?
Oh, I'm Chad.

130
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:27,379
You know me from we were in
K through 8 together.

131
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:29,982
Hey, babes.
Hey, Joey!

132
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,984
Oh, um, did you get
that playlist I made?

133
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:33,519
I'm deejaying now, so...

134
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:36,454
It's actually going pretty well.
Um, they're paying me, so...

135
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:37,923
Th-That's really... That...

136
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:41,459
That's really just so exciting.

137
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:42,995
Yeah.

138
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,820
I'm... I'm Chad.

139
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm Joey.

140
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:50,602
Yep.

141
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:53,205
My name is Chad.

142
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,141
I, um, love music.

143
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,077
I love both radio and non-radio.

144
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:00,879
Have you guys heard of
the Coachella Valley.

145
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:03,281
Music and Arts Festival?

146
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:06,018
It's in California. Mm.

147
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,619
I'm either gonna go to it

148
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:11,156
or try to watch footage of it
on the internet.

149
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,226
Jay-Z and Beyoncé.

150
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,895
Okay.

151
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,364
Anyways, um...

152
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,298
Oh, right... are you guys
coming over this weekend?

153
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:21,767
'Cause it's gonna be
super intimate,

154
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,436
just like a handful of rad,
interesting people.

155
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,971
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm down.

156
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:27,973
Okay. It's gonna be
at 7:00, I think.

157
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:30,108
And it should go till like 11.

158
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:32,533
Um, I had sex.

159
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:35,503
What?

160
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,852
I, um, just...

161
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:44,056
I just had a little bit of sex
this summer,

162
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,124
over summer break,

163
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:47,593
is what I was gonna tell you

164
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:51,997
when we were talking about
summer earlier.

165
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,800
So, yeah, it was great.

166
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:59,537
Don't know what you guys did,
but I had sex.

167
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:02,074
You had sex?

168
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:03,609
Full on. Yes.

169
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:05,677
With a female

170
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:08,546
horny style.

171
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,283
You lost your virginity?

172
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:13,551
It's completely gone.

173
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:16,688
Well, why are you
telling us this?

174
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:19,357
Just thought it was
an interesting fun fact

175
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:22,250
about me and my summer
and my lifestyle.

176
00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:26,698
Do you...
Do you know what I mean?

177
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,366
Yeah.

178
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,258
Yeah.

179
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,640
Tell us, killer.
What's it like to be a man?

180
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:37,175
Yeah. Tell us.

181
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:38,977
Oh, i-it's great.

182
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,446
Yeah, there was definitely a lot

183
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,448
of verbal consent
and everything.

184
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:45,851
And obviously we were both
blushing the whole time.

185
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:46,985
Legend. Yeah.

186
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,454
You know, we took turns.

187
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:51,189
A-At first
she was the one having sex,

188
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:53,125
and then I was the one
having sex.

189
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,061
And then we were having sex
at the same time.

190
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:58,464
And then at the end,
we both exploded.

191
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:00,132
Ohh, damn!

192
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:01,934
Sounds like she was
after that D!

193
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,335
Yeah, she really was.

194
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,670
And I was after that P...

195
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:06,004
That... That V.

196
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:07,205
Aah! Meh!

197
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:08,406
Her genitals.

198
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,342
Like, what...
Like, what happened?

199
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:12,278
Um, she let me touch her butt

200
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,546
and, like, spit on her face
and also...

201
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,749
Also, she also let me spit on her butt.

202
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,485
I know.

203
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:22,420
Everyone is taken aback
when they hear the story.

204
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:24,690
Good job.

205
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:26,292
Thank you.

206
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,382
So much.

207
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:34,867
Thank you.

208
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:38,804
Oh, my God, my bra's inside out.

209
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,407
Can you get that? It's Ikrimah.
He's picking me up for a date.

210
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:43,141
I don't even know this person!

211
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,411
Chad! On a scale of 1 to 10,

212
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:48,546
just how Muslim
will his physical situation be?

213
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,617
Answer the door.
Just so I'm prepared!

214
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,140
Ugh!

215
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:59,758
You must be Chad.
Nice to meet you.

216
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:01,827
I'm Ikrimah.

217
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,229
Y-You're Ikrimah?

218
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,298
Yeah. What's up, man?

219
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:07,833
Please welc...

220
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,968
Welcome to our home.

221
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:21,269
Ahh!

222
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:25,050
I've heard a lot about you.

223
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,584
Thanks.

224
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:29,277
I-I like your clothing style.

225
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:34,192
You look like the freakin'
star of Hollywood.

226
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,794
Thanks.

227
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:37,195
Hey!

228
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,664
Thanks for scoopin' me up.

229
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,466
Yeah... Can Ikrimah
drive me to school,

230
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,734
since I don't have a dad
in my life?

231
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:45,203
Uh, no, this is our third date.

232
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,738
I don't really think
that's necessary.

233
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:50,208
There's violence
on the bus. What?

234
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,278
Chad, can we talk
about this later?

235
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:54,280
No, I-I can do it.

236
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:56,882
Right on.

237
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,739
Thank you.

238
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,357
S-So, is my mom doing

239
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,493
whatever it is
she needs to be doing

240
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:09,217
to keep you happy?

241
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,364
She's great, yeah.
That's awesome.

242
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:15,968
Can... Can you actually drive
into the entrance right here?

243
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:17,235
Is that allowed?

244
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,237
Yeah, no, they want us
to do that.

245
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,039
Okay. Yeah, great.

246
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:23,175
Put on some tunes.

247
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:24,710
Yep.

248
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,649
Just hit that horn.

249
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:32,117
Great. Yeah, this is great.

250
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:33,319
Yeah, right here.
Right here, yeah?

251
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:34,675
Yeah, that's awesome.

252
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:37,856
Sick chatting with you about

253
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,525
things important
to both of us, man!

254
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:41,849
I love you!

255
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:46,598
That's Ikrimah.

256
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,210
These teachers
are really, really funny.

257
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,301
Look at their costumes.

258
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,950
Uh, hey, Chad?

259
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,752
This is for you.

260
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,157
Marjorie?

261
00:12:12,181 --> 00:12:15,427
Isn't that the goth girl that calls
teachers by their first name?

262
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:20,298
She probably just has some sort
of school help question.

263
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,901
Girl: Ow! Hey, guys...

264
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:33,445
Hey, Marjorie, I

265
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:35,914
got your feminine napkin.

266
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:37,538
Get over here.

267
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:48,460
Ch-Chair's broken.

268
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:52,130
Heard about your summer.

269
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:53,531
Okay.

270
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:56,602
At least there's one boy
at this school I can talk to

271
00:12:56,626 --> 00:12:57,936
who gets it.

272
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,808
Who understands
that first feeling of intimacy

273
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:07,213
and the incessant need for more
that follows.

274
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:08,880
For sure.

275
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:11,283
It was an incredible
opportunity,

276
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:13,151
and I'm definitely
gonna do it again.

277
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:17,289
But it's actually now time
for me to focus on my academics.

278
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:19,225
Why don't you come over tonight?

279
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:20,681
What?

280
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:27,565
My address is on the back.

281
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:29,501
What are we gonna do?

282
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,710
Wow.

283
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,245
What<i> are</i> you gonna do?

284
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,447
Well, she wants sex,

285
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:43,715
so obviously we're both
gonna go to her house

286
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,517
and we're both gonna
have sex with her.

287
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,852
Probably one at a time.

288
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:49,054
I'm definitely not going.
She scares me.

289
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,590
What are you talking about?
I'm going, and I'm not scared.

290
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:53,058
You sure?
I think you're freaking out

291
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,793
'cause your lie
is getting out of control.

292
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:57,129
My lie is the best thing
that ever happened to us,

293
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:58,330
and you know it, Peter.

294
00:13:58,354 --> 00:13:59,597
You're just jealous.

295
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,733
I'm really not.
I'm afraid of her.

296
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,669
Are you wearing leather shorts?

297
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:05,337
Yeah, they're my mom's.

298
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:06,672
Why are you wearing
your mom's clothes?

299
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:08,674
My dad's clothes
were too small for me.

300
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:11,076
Stop wearing
your parents' clothes!

301
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,146
You're your own boy, Peter!
Wear<i> your</i> clothes!

302
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,481
God!

303
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:19,418
Okay. Good luck tonight!

304
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,113
Up here.

305
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,582
Found it.

306
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:56,521
What's this?

307
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:59,324
Just some absinthe.

308
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:02,861
My ex-boyfriend brought me some
back from Amsterdam.

309
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:05,397
Fuuuu...

310
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,132
Europe's awesome.

311
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:11,336
Hey, real quick, do you mind
if this night stays between us?

312
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,139
Yeah, alright.

313
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,608
Also, you should know,

314
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:18,076
um, I've had a lot
of different kinds

315
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,013
of sexual intercourse,
and sometimes,

316
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:24,683
honestly, my penis doesn't
even come into play at all,

317
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,619
and I've still walked away
being like,

318
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:28,776
"That... That was good for me."

319
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:32,957
Yup, a-yup.

320
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:35,828
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yop.

321
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,364
Why don't we put on some music?

322
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:42,234
Okeydokey.

323
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:43,925
Drink up.

324
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,734
What?

325
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:18,337
I just, I need to go
to the bathroom.

326
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:20,405
The music is so loud.

327
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:23,808
'cause the music's so loud,
I just want to go...

328
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,837
It's just so loud. It's so loud.

329
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:41,026
I'm really not.

330
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,969
Chad.

331
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:55,840
What have you
gotten yourself into?

332
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:04,249
Look at me, Chad.

333
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,586
Chad, do you like this?

334
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,391
Oh, my God, it's all happening.

335
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:15,527
I'm having sex with this girl.

336
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,139
Aah!

337
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,954
God, where am I?!

338
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:57,502
Sorry.

339
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:02,240
Chaddy joon,
is everything alright?

340
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:03,442
Go away, Uncle Hamid.

341
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:04,643
Okay, bye.

342
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,045
Stay with me! Okay.

343
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,916
What happened, Chad?

344
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,918
I was tricked into
being a booty call

345
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:15,520
and I'm freaking out now
and I want...

346
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,256
I want my mommy.

347
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,057
It's okay, Chad.

348
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:20,859
Your mommy is kissing right now,

349
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:22,595
but I am here for you.

350
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,466
Listen, I don't totally
understand your situation yet,

351
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,537
but when I was dating multiple
women in post-revolution Iran,

352
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:36,141
things became... very messy.

353
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:38,277
Everyone was tricking
each other.

354
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:39,612
Tricking, tricking.

355
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:41,146
I'm tricking you,
I'm tricking you.

356
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,881
No, you are my friend.
No, you're not my friend.

357
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:44,949
You are tricking me again.

358
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:48,086
Ultimately,
it is always the trickster

359
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,622
who pays the highest price.

360
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:52,491
What are you talking about?!

361
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:55,160
I'm saying you will be
alright... I don't understand.

362
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:56,495
What happened?

363
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,230
Chad's booty was called tonight

364
00:18:58,254 --> 00:19:00,699
and he is very upset about it.

365
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,501
Alright, Hamid. Thank you.

366
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:07,973
Okay, let's stay calm.

367
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:09,974
Walk me through what happened.

368
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:11,776
You were with a girl?

369
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,179
Yes, and she's too fast for me.

370
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:18,250
A-And I blacked out right as
she was mounting my body.

371
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:19,985
Wait, you blacked out?

372
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:21,854
So you're not exactly sure
what happened?

373
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:24,723
Stop grilling me!

374
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,726
I don't remember anything!

375
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,863
Except that I'm a liar,
I'm a big old liar,

376
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:33,732
and now I'm probably a father.

377
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,801
Honey. I don't
wanna be a father!

378
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:38,671
Wait, we can fix this.

379
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:39,804
I'll call her mom.

380
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:41,806
No, I'll kill you! Okay!

381
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,276
I don't even know
if she has a mom!

382
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,744
She just has a neighbor

383
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,546
and a debit card.

384
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,814
She doesn't even use a backpack.

385
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:52,217
She just comes to class

386
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:55,888
with a b-broken pencil
and a ripped piece of paper.

387
00:19:55,912 --> 00:20:00,225
Have you ever heard
of such a terrifying thing?!

388
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:03,896
I just want to play video games
with Peter!

389
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:10,035
Come here. Come here, baby.

390
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:13,972
Oh, sweetheart.

391
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:15,908
I brought you water.

392
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:18,176
That's very nice of you, Niki.

393
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,668
Chad, you want to say thank you?

394
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,410
I don't really like water,
but fine.

395
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:43,202
Get out of here,
you li-little dipshit.

396
00:20:43,226 --> 00:20:45,270
Chad.

397
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:48,473
I'm sorry about whatever
happened, sweetie.

398
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,076
Being a teenager
can be really tough.

399
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,611
It's horrifying.

400
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:55,414
Now, tomorrow morning,
I want you to go up to this girl

401
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:58,150
and get the full story
of what happened.

402
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,341
We can go from there. Okay?

403
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:04,345
Okay.

404
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,229
Please turn on
my Fortnite light.

405
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:11,630
Okay.

406
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,947
Hey, Marjorie.

407
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:30,081
Your bedsheets. Thanks.

408
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:32,083
Not really sure
why you took those.

409
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:34,353
You were fully clothed.

410
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:38,290
It was very disorienting
waking up like that.

411
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:40,291
Listen, Marjorie,
I'd give anything for you

412
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:44,185
to tell me nothing happened,
but I have to ask you.

413
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:47,967
Did we have sex?
Are you pregnant?

414
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:49,301
How do we know I'm the dad?

415
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:52,103
Chad, you passed out.
We didn't have sex.

416
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:55,174
What? We didn't have sex.

417
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:57,843
I can tell you're saying that
to make me feel better.

418
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,845
And it's working. Thank you.

419
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:00,712
It's the truth.

420
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,582
Hey, thank you.

421
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:05,584
Don't wink at me.

422
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:19,464
You're a good girl.

423
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:20,732
No, I'm not.

424
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,401
Maybe like the fashion club
or the chess club

425
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,870
or something like that.
Oh. I see that for you.

426
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:27,673
Just want to hear... Hey, Peter.

427
00:22:27,697 --> 00:22:29,140
Denise.

428
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:30,942
So, did you have sex?

429
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:32,143
How was it?

430
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,880
I did have sex. It was intense.

431
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:36,481
You should know, though,

432
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:39,084
that we have decided
not to tell people.

433
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,220
So don't tell anyone.

434
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:43,222
Unless you want to.

435
00:22:43,246 --> 00:22:44,089
Wow.

436
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,957
I feel like you're lying.

437
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:48,027
Denise, don't.
Don't be like that.

438
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:50,762
Reid: Hey, Chad! Hop in.

439
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,632
Looks like Reid wants me to join
him on a stolen golf cart.

440
00:22:53,656 --> 00:22:55,034
That's exciting.

441
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:57,892
I promise I'll come back
for you guys, probably.

442
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:06,511
Here you go, dawg.
Help yourself.

443
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:07,579
Thanks.

444
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,203
Ooh, worms!

445
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,518
Damn! You're a professional.

446
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:15,921
I trip balls from
just like half of one.

447
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:16,922
What?

448
00:23:16,946 --> 00:23:19,258
That's weed, dude.

449
00:23:19,282 --> 00:23:20,860
Ugh!

450
00:23:20,884 --> 00:23:22,728
Raul: What are you doing?

451
00:23:22,752 --> 00:23:24,863
Ugh! Ugh!

452
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:27,132
See you guys later.
