Reid,
get in the car!

354
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,531
Wait.
Aren't you Chad's older brother?

355
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,492
I wish.

356
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,661

357
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,666
Chad, this is weird.

358

see her, Reid.

359
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,214
What? Who?

360
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,342
The horny wine woman
who ruined your family.

361
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,969
No, Chad,
I'm not doing that.

362
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,054
You're never gonna get
the closure you want

363
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,264

364
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,600
So you tell me--
you want to keep dreaming

365
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,394
about confronting
your father's sex mistress,

366
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,440

that dream into a reality?

367

368
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,114
All right,
there she is.

369
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,826
There's the extra-marital woman.
Let's do this.

370
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,328
I don't know if this is
a good idea.

371
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,537
I believe in you, buddy.

372
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,539
We just gotta go in there
and confront her.

373
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,626
Okay? Clear eyes, long eyes
don't lose.

374

No.

But since you know him so well,
why don't you tell him?

Oh, shit.
Okay.

393
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,055

you two should leave.

I'm not leaving

why you had an affair
with my father.

Boom.
You know what?

You have no clue
how hard it was on me.

399
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,651
How hard it was on you? What
about how hard it was for me?

400
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,986
Yes!
My-- My--
My whole family?

401
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,114
What are you talking about?
Tell her.

402

You're right.
And I'm sorry.

Um...

It's just that,
it wasn't exactly

405

like a picnic for me,
you know?

406
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,247
I mean,
when I met your dad,

407
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,749
I was in
a really dark place.

408
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,750
I was struggling.

409
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,794
I was drinking-- a lot.
I mean...

410
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,504
I mean,
if that wasn't enough,

411
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,507
my grandpa was in his third
back-to-back UTI.

412
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,092
That old story.
What the hell?

413
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,302
When I met Alan, I thought
he was just gonna swoop in

414
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,847
and solve all my problems.
But he couldn't.

415
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,015
Because they never can.

416
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,182
Think we should bounce.

417
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,308
No, let her keep going.

418
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,977
It's because
I'm an empath.

419
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,980
I'm an empath, and I started to
take on all of Alan's stress.

420
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,606
Next thing I know,
I'm spiraling.

421
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,110
And then my entire life is now
defined by an online video of me

422
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,072
screaming in the face
of a Latinx Subway employee.

423
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,491
So, yeah. Ugh.

424
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,327

Well,
all of that aside,

427
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,044
you-- you still knew
he was married.

428
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,087
Yes.
I did.

429
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:31,759
But your dad was
profoundly unhappy.

430
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,719
And I know you're really mad
right now,

431

your dad is a good guy.

I fell in love with him.

That's--

434

That's why I'm still in love
with him.

he is happier
