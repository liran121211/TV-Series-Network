1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,771
- AND TO MY WIFE,
I APOLOGIZE.

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:07,608
ALL I CAN SAY IS,
I WASN'T JUST HAVING SEX.

3
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:11,712
I WAS MAKING LOVE
TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN...

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:12,746
AND HER BOYFRIEND,

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,050
AND A THIRD PERSON
WHOSE NAME I NEVER LEARNED.

6
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:19,153
FURTHERMORE,
IT WAS WRONG OF ME TO SAY

7
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:21,189
I WAS BUILDING HOUSES
FOR THE UNDERPRIVILEGED

8
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,791
WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY
HAVING FOUR-WAY SEX

9
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,660
IN A CAVE IN BRAZIL.

10
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,462
- I BET CAVE SEX IS IN-SANE.

11
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:29,397
- WHY?

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,632
- BECAUSE OF THE ECHOES
AND THE HUMIDITY.

13
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:35,769
- IN MY DEFENSE,
IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY,

14
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,838
AND I REALLY WANTED TO DO IT.

15
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,673
- I THINK IT'S A REAL SHAME

16
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:43,444
WHEN PEOPLE FOCUS ON
THE TAWDRY DETAILS OF A SCANDAL.

17
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:44,745
PERSONALLY, ALL I CARE ABOUT

18
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,148
IS COUNCILMAN DEXHART'S
POLICIES,

19
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:50,184
NOT WHETHER HE WAS HIGH
ON NITROUS AND COCAINE

20
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:51,819
DURING THE CAVE SEX...

21
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,721
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
I HEARD HE WAS.

22
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:56,257
- ONE MORE SHOCKING REVELATION
IN A STORY

23
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,126
THAT JUST
WON'T STOP UNFOLDING.

24
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,094
IT TURNS OUT
COUNCILMAN DEXHART

25
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:02,563
MAY HAVE ALSO HAD SEX
WITH A PROSTITUTE

26
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,799
IN THE LIMOUSINE
ON THE WAY TO AND FROM

27
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,102
THE PRESS CONFERENCE
WHERE HE APOLOGIZED

28
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,437
FOR HAVING AN AFFAIR.

29
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,806
- WHY DOES ANYBODY WANT TO RUN
FOR PUBLIC OFFICE?

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,476
YOU'RE JUST ASKING TO HAVE
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE EXPOSED.

31
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,711
- WELL, IF YOU'RE SQUEAKY CLEAN,
LIKE I AM,

32
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,313
THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

33
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:21,482
- TOM, YOU'RE MARRIED, AND YOU
HIT ON WOMEN CONSTANTLY.

34
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,485
- YEAH, BUT I'VE
NEVER SEALED THE DEAL.

35
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,786
JUST WINDOW SHOPPING.

36
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,321
YOU CAN FLY TO BRAZIL,

37
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:28,656
JUST DON'T ENTER THE CAVE.
AM I RIGHT?

38
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,258
UP TOP.

39
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,429
[triumphant music]

40
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:43,471
*

41
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,782
- I'M SURE THAT YOU THINK
THAT YOU'RE CLEAN,

42
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,385
BUT I BET THAT WE COULD FIND
SOMETHING ON YOU.

43
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:58,619
- I CHANGED MY NAME,
WHICH IS LEGAL,

44
00:01:58,652 --> 00:01:59,753
AND ONCE IN HIGH SCHOOL,

45
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,355
A GIRL BEAT ME
IN A WRESTLING MATCH.

46
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:03,391
THAT'S IT.
I BET ANYTHING

47
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:04,825
I CAN FIND WORSE STUFF
ON ALL YOU GUYS.

48
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,760
- ARE YOU SUGGESTING A GAME?

49
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:07,828
I'M IN.

50
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,298
- I'M IN.
- I'M OUT.

51
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:12,666
- NOT AN OPTION, JERRY.
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

52
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,835
- NO, SERIOUSLY, I REALLY
DON'T WANT TO PLAY.

53
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,304
- NO, NO, SERIOUSLY,
YOU ARE PLAYING.

54
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:17,771
WE'RE GONNA NAIL YOU.

55
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,440
- I WILL PLAY, TOO.

56
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,343
IF ONLY TO PROVE
THAT I CAN FIND MORE DIRT ON YOU

57
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,744
THAN YOU CAN ON ME.

58
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:26,314
- THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL PLAYING.

59
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,349
- YOUR DESK IS OVER THERE.

60
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,751
- I LOVE GAMES THAT TURN PEOPLE
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

61
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,920
- YOU GUYS WILL NEVER BELIEVE
WHAT I JUST FOUND

62
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,688
ON JERRY'S FACEBOOK.

63
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,325
- A FRIEND. BURN.

64
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,693
- OKAY, AGAIN,
I'D REALLY RATHER NOT PLAY.

65
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,295
- HEY, GUYS,
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

66
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,497
- TRYING TO SEE WHO HAS
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF DIRT ON THEM

67
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,766
IN CASE SOMEONE WANTS
TO RUN FOR OFFICE.

68
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,668
- OH, WELL, IT AIN'T JERRY,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

69
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,703
HE'S GOT A COUPLE
OF 3-5-9s ON HIM.

70
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,205
PUBLIC URINATION.

71
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,806
- I DON'T LIKE THIS GAME.

72
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,675
JUST DON'T LIKE IT.

73
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,513
- HE'S PROBABLY GONNA GO
ANGER PEE IN THE COURTYARD.

74
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,715
- [laughs]

75
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:05,586
- WELL, YOU CRAZY PARK PEOPLE,
UH, I'M OUT OF HERE.

76
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,555
LESLIE, I'LL--
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

77
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,957
- TOMORROW WILL BE
OUR FIRST OFFICIAL--

78
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,292
FIRST DATE.

79
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,260
- ROGER THAT.

80
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,662
- COPY. OVER AND OUT.

81
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,598
DAVE AND I ARE GOING
ON OUR FIRST DATE TOMORROW.

82
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:18,966
I'M NOT NERVOUS.

83
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,434
WHY SHOULD I BE NERVOUS?

84
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,935
WE'RE JUST TWO PEOPLE
GOING ON A FIRST DATE.

85
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,837
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT.

86
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,906
[cell phone rings]
AAH!

87
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:32,746
THAT WAS MY PHONE.

88
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,882
- HEY.
- HI THERE.

89
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,285
WHAT ARE YOU, UH...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

90
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,819
- JUST HAVING LUNCH
WITH LESLIE.

91
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:39,753
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

92
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:41,989
- I'M LOOKING
FOR SCANDALOUS INFORMATION

93
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:46,327
ABOUT MY CO-WORKERS
FOR A GAME THAT WE'RE PLAYING.

94
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,829
- MY TAXES PAY YOUR SALARY,
RIGHT?

95
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,798
- YEAH.

96
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,800
- COOL.

97
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,805
AND HE LOOKED UP AT ME,

98
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:01,675
AND HE SAID, "THANK YOU.
YOU SAVED MY LIFE."

99
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,911
- YEAH. HEY, LISTEN,

100
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,713
I'M REALLY NERVOUS
ABOUT THIS DATE TOMORROW NIGHT.

101
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,582
DO YOU HAVE, LIKE, A FIRST DATE
OUTFIT I COULD BORROW?

102
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:11,018
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,
PAIR OF CARGO PANTS.

103
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,053
- YEAH, I WOULDN'T GO
WITH A CARGO PANT.

104
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,988
- WHAT ABOUT,
LIKE, A SEXY HAT?

105
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,490
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT EVEN IS.

106
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:17,825
- HELPING ALREADY.

107
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,760
- DO YOU WANT TO JUST COME BY
AFTER WORK TODAY?

108
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,495
- SURE, YEAH. TONIGHT?

109
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,664
SEVERAL HOURS FROM NOW?

110
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,767
[sighs]

111
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,670
- OR YOU COULD JUST
COME OVER NOW?

112
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:30,871
- I THINK THAT WOULD BETTER.

113
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,840
THAT WOULD GIVE US MORE TIME.
LET'S GO.

114
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,379
- OH, WHAT YOU DOING, GUYS?

115
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:39,847
LOOKING FOR DIRT ON ME?

116
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,848
NO POINT.

117
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,683
GIVE UP NOW.

118
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:46,320
OH, WAIT,
THERE IS THIS.

119
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:50,358
EVERYBODY, I BOUGHT
A CROISSAN'WICH THIS MORNING.

120
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:53,427
THIS ISN'T EVEN A REAL RECEIPT,
JUST A SCRAP OF PAPER.

121
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,363
- TALIBAN ROBES!

122
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:57,731
- WHAT? WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT PHOTO FROM?

123
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:01,635
- HEY, TOM,
NICE TALIBAN ROBES.

124
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:02,836
- THOSE AREN'T TALIBAN ROBES.

125
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,804
THAT'S FROM HALLOWEEN
TEN YEARS AGO.

126
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,506
I WAS DRESSED LIKE A JEDI.

127
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:08,742
- I'M SURE THAT THE VOTERS WOULD
BE ABLE TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

128
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,412
- MM, LOOKS TO ME
LIKE YOU'RE IN THE TALIBAN.

129
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,914
- WELL, DID EVERYBODY KNOW
THAT RON'S EX-WIFE TAMMY

130
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,750
IS ACTUALLY HIS SECOND EX-WIFE
NAMED TAMMY?

131
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,853
THAT'S RIGHT.
RON HAS TWO EX-WIVES,

132
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:23,090
EACH NAMED TAMMY.

133
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,459
- BOTH OF THEM BITCHES.

134
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:28,962
YES, MY MOM'S NAME
IS TAMMY.

135
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:32,766
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

136
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,136
TOM! THAT WAS A JAEGER-SECRET.

137
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,806
YOU JUST BREACHED
A JAEGER-SECRET.

138
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,609
- DAMN!
THIS JUST HEATED UP QUICK.

139
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,478
- * TA-DA

140
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:45,613
- THAT LOOKS GREAT.
- YEAH?

141
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,881
- WILL YOU BE WEARING IT
OUT OF THE STORE TODAY, MADAME?

142
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:51,719
- [British accent]
OH, I THINK I WILL, GOOD LADY.

143
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,522
HEY, WHILE I HAVE YOU,
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

144
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:55,756
- SHOOT.

145
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:56,824
- WHAT IF HE ASKS ME
IF I'VE BEEN MARRIED?

146
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:57,825
- HAVE YOU?
- NO.

147
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,493
- WELL, THEN SAY THAT.

148
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,828
- BUT THEN HE'LL WONDER
WHY I HAVEN'T BEEN MARRIED.

149
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,662
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO?

150
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,863
I'M GONNA SAY
THAT I WAS MARRIED,

151
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,399
BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS,
SHOULD I SAY THAT I HAVE KIDS?

152
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:06,834
GUY LIKE GIRLS
THAT HAVE KIDS, RIGHT?

153
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,135
- WHOA.
- WHAT IF I GET DRUNK

154
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,870
AND I TALK
ABOUT DARFUR TOO MUCH?

155
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,839
OR NOT ENOUGH? WHAT IF I DON'T
BRING UP DARFUR ENOUGH?

156
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,874
- LESLIE, RELAX.

157
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,809
- YEAH.
- OKAY?

158
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,878
- I JUST HAVE A FEW
MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU, ANN.

159
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,713
"WHAT IF HE SHOWS UP
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN?

160
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,882
"WHAT IF ONE OF MY SLEEVES
CATCHES ON FIRE

161
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,684
"AND IT SPREADS RAPIDLY?

162
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,486
"WHAT IF, INSTEAD OF TIC TACS,

163
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,087
"I ACCIDENTALLY POP
A COUPLE OF AMBIEN,

164
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,889
AND I HAVE TO KEEP PUNCHING
MY LEG TO STAY AWAKE?"

165
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,425
- THOSE ARE
ALL INSANE HYPOTHETICALS,

166
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,993
AND I PROMISE YOU
THEY WON'T HAPPEN.

167
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:36,530
- THEY HAVE HAPPENED.

168
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,832
ALL OF THESE
HAVE HAPPENED TO ME.

169
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,067
UH, NO, THERE'S MORE.

170
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,504
ONE TIME, I ACCIDENTALLY DRANK
AN ENTIRE BOTTLE OF VINEGAR.

171
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:44,572
I THOUGHT IT WAS
TERRIBLE WINE.

172
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,475
ONCE, I WENT OUT WITH A GUY
WHO WORE 3-D GLASSES

173
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,308
THE ENTIRE EVENING.

174
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,077
OH, ONE TIME,
I RODE IN A SIDECAR

175
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,512
ON A GUY'S MOTORCYCLE,

176
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,780
AND THE SIDECAR DETACHED

177
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,815
AND WENT DOWN
A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.

178
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,818
ANOTHER TIME, I WENT TO A REALLY
BORING MOVIE WITH A GUY,

179
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:58,886
AND WHILE I WAS ASLEEP,

180
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,788
HE TRIED TO PULL OUT
ONE OF MY TEETH.

181
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,791
I LITERALLY WOKE UP
WITH HIS HAND IN MY MOUTH.

182
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,526
WE WENT OUT A COUPLE TIMES
AFTER THAT,

183
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,560
BUT THEN HE GOT WEIRD.

184
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,228
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY.

185
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,732
I'M A GROWN WOMAN, BUT I'M
JUST NOT GOOD ON FIRST DATES.

186
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,868
- OH. OKAY.
OKAY, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,

187
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,670
AND THIS IS
HOW WE'RE GONNA FIX IT.

188
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:18,205
- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
I WEAR AN EARPIECE,

189
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,841
YOU SIT AT A TABLE NEARBY,
YOU SPEAK INTO A MIKE,

190
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,175
YOU TELL ME WHAT TO SAY
ON THE DATE,

191
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,111
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
ANN, IT NEVER WORKS.

192
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,179
- NO, NO, NO,
WE ARE GONNA GO TO A RESTAURANT

193
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,347
AND HAVE A PRACTICE DATE.

194
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,883
I WILL PRETEND TO BE DAVE,
AND YOU WILL PRACTICE ON ME.

195
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:33,754
- OH, THAT'S
A WAY BETTER IDEA.

196
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,624
HEY, DAVE, IT'S ME.
IT'S LESLIE.

197
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,091
- HI, LESLIE,
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

198
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,927
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
QUITE YET.

199
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,097
- OH! SO, DAVE,
LET'S BEGIN OUR CONVERSATION.

200
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,201
- WHAT'S ON THE NOTE CARDS?

201
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,103
- THEY'RE POSSIBLE TOPICS
OF CONVERSATION.

202
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,907
WHALES, PARADES,
ELECTRICITY...

203
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,576
AND THE REST ARE BLANK.

204
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,210
- YEAH, WELL, I COULDN'T
THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE.

205
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,847
- LESLIE'S IN WORSE SHAPE
THAN I THOUGHT.

206
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,751
- [laughing]

207
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,053
- IS SHE PRACTICE LAUGHING?

208
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:10,558
- OH, DAVE.
YOU--AHEM.

209
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,828
- THE DANISH CALL IT
OPPE OG NEDE APPARAT,

210
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,930
WHICH LITERALLY TRANSLATED
MEANS

211
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,566
"THE UP AND DOWN MACHINE."

212
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,735
- WOW. THAT'S A THOROUGH HISTORY
OF THE TEETER-TOTTER.

213
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:22,903
- NOW I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT

214
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,573
THE LOCAL FLORA AND FAUNA
FOUND IN PAWNEE.

215
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,975
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST ASK ME A QUESTION.

216
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,042
JUST TRY TO GET TO KNOW ME.

217
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:32,312
- OKAY.

218
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,914
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
TO ASK YOU.

219
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,716
I'M SORRY.
MY MIND IS BLANK.

220
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,718
- JUST ASK ME THE FIRST THING
THAT COMES TO YOUR HEAD.

221
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,654
- HOW BIG IS IT?

222
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,990
- REALLY?
- OH, MY GOD.

223
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,325
- HEY, TOMMY. HI.

224
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,159
YOU READY?

225
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,630
- YES, I AM.
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

226
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,999
HEY, DONNA,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

227
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,333
DO YOU HATE BLACK PEOPLE?

228
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,702
- EXCUSE ME?

229
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,837
- 'CAUSE APPARENTLY
IN 1988,

230
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,672
YOU DONATED MONEY

231
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,608
TO THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
FOR...

232
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:01,975
DAVID DUKE!

233
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,176
- THE KKK GUY?

234
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,712
- I GOT A PHONE CALL.

235
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,113
THEY SAID
HE WOULD LOWER TAXES.

236
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,615
- BOOM!

237
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:08,916
HOW'S IT FEEL
TO LOSE SO HARD?

238
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,885
I'M SORRY, HONEY.
LET'S GET COFFEE.

239
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,088
RE-RON, YOU REMEMBER
MY WIFE, WENDY HAVERFORD.

240
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,590
- OF COURSE.
HOW ARE THINGS AT THE HOSPITAL?

241
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:19,126
- UH, VERY GOOD,
THANK YOU.

242
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,294
I JUST GOT A PEDIATRIC
SURGERY FELLOWSHIP.

243
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,262
- OH, NICE.

244
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,698
- WE'RE CELEBRATING,
'CAUSE SHE'S SUPER RICH

245
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,366
AND SUPER HOT ALSO.

246
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,235
- OKAY, COME ON, TOMMY.
CUT IT OUT.

247
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,603
- YOU'RE SUPER HOT.

248
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,071
EVERYBODY ELSE
HAS TO DEAL WITH IT.

249
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,007
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
SEE YOU LATER, RON.

250
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,945
- I'VE ESTABLISHED
A SCIENTIFICALLY PERFECT

251
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,013
TEN-POINT SCALE
OF HUMAN BEAUTY.

252
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,182
WENDY IS A 7.4,

253
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,718
WHICH IS WAY TOO HIGH
FOR TOM,

254
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,854
WHO IS A 3.8.

255
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:51,825
TEN IS TENNIS LEGEND
STEFFI GRAF.

256
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,894
- HI, DAVE.

257
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,228
- YOU'RE LATE,

258
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,164
AND I CAN SEE YOUR NIPPLES
THROUGH YOUR DRESS.

259
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,866
- WHAT? NO. REALLY?

260
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,234
- IN NURSING SCHOOL,
WE TOOK A PSYCH COURSE

261
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,135
ON HOW TO TREAT PHOBIAS

262
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,705
WITH A METHOD CALLED
EXPOSURE THERAPY.

263
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,239
SO LIKE IF YOU WERE
AFRAID OF SNAKES,

264
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,709
THEY WOULD IMMERSE YOU
IN A TANK OF SNAKES,

265
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:12,846
SO I AM GOING TO IMMERSE LESLIE
IN A TANK OF BAD DATE.

266
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,048
YOU'RE 20 MINUTES LATE.
I ALMOST LEFT.

267
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:19,419
- OKAY. WELL, I WAS, UH...
DROPPING MY NIECE OFF.

268
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,654
- WHAT'S YOUR NIECE'S NAME?

269
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,356
- TORPLE. WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

270
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,859
THAT'S NOT A NAME.
I DON'T HAVE A NIECE.

271
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:26,927
- [sighs]

272
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,428
- MY NIECE'S NAME
IS STEPHANIE?

273
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,197
- STOP LYING!
- HEY, LOOK, THERE'S BREAD!

274
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,865
YOU WANT SOME--OH, NO!

275
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,802
OH, I GOT FLOWERS IN YOUR SOUP.
I'M SO SORRY, UM...

276
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:38,038
JUST--I HAVE TO GO
TO THE, UM...

277
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,040
WHIZZ PALACE.
YOU KNOW, DAVE, THE--

278
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,675
THE PLACE WHERE YOU--

279
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,711
YOU KNOW, THE TOILET THING.

280
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,916
IT'S A BATHROOM!

281
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,784
IT'S CALLED A BATHROOM!

282
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:57,457
- HEY, MARK, UM,
A LITTLE BIRDY TOLD ME

283
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,728
THAT YOU HAVE
ONE UNPAID PARKING TICKET.

284
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,395
- THAT'S FUNNY,
BECAUSE A LITTLE BIRDY TOLD ME

285
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,931
THAT YOUR ADOPTIVE MOTHER

286
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,833
WAS ARRESTED
FOR MARIJUANA POSSESSION.

287
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,135
- [laughing] OH, SNAP!

288
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,103
- WHAT?
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT, HUH?

289
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,441
- I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS ADOPTED.

290
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,979
- OH, NO. OH, JERRY.

291
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,848
OH, JERRY, I'M SO SORRY.

292
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,883
- I REALLY DIDN'T
WANT TO PLAY.

293
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,986
- THAT WAS NOT MY INTENTION.

294
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,120
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

295
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:30,090
HE TOTALLY BAITED YOU
WITH THAT UNPAID PARKING TICKET.

296
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:33,360
- TOM, COULD YOU
COME INTO MY OFFICE?

297
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,863
TOM-MATO SAUCE.

298
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,731
- RON-TANAMO BAY.

299
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:39,432
- DO BE SEATED,

300
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,035
AND CONGRATULATE ME.

301
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,436
- FOR WHAT?

302
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,471
- WINNING THE GAME.

303
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,006
I JUST FOUND OUT,

304
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,208
THROUGH SOME PRETTY IMPRESSIVE
INVESTIGATING,

305
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,778
THAT YOUR WEDDING
WAS A SHAM.

306
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,379
IT'S A GREEN CARD MARRIAGE.

307
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,414
- THAT'S CRAZY. I WAS BORN
IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

308
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,282
THESE COLORS DON'T RUN,
BABY.

309
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,218
- YES, BUT WENDY
WAS BORN IN OTTAWA...

310
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,219
CANADA!

311
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,421
HER VISA WAS SET TO EXPIRE

312
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,823
THE DAY
AFTER YOU GOT MARRIED

313
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,524
AT THE COUNTY COURTHOUSE

314
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,795
IN FRONT OF THREE STRANGERS
AND NO FAMILY.

315
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,463
- OKAY, WE MET IN COLLEGE.

316
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,265
SHE WANTED TO WORK
IN THE STATES.

317
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,534
SHE COULDN'T GET A PERMIT.

318
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,404
- I KNEW IT. I KNEW YOU COULDN'T
GET A WIFE AS HOT AS HER.

319
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,539
- SERIOUSLY, RON,
GAMES ASIDE,

320
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,541
YOU GOT TO KEEP THIS BETWEEN US.
DON'T TELL ANYBODY, PLEASE.

321
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,476
- COME ON, DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT GONNA TURN YOU IN.

322
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,546
JUST ADMIT THAT WHEN IT COMES
TO DIGGING UP DIRT,

323
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,281
I BESTED YOU IN THIS GAME.

324
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,817
SAY IT.
SAY "I BESTED YOU."

325
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,419
- FINE, YOU BESTED ME.
IS THAT ALL?

326
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,154
- NO.

327
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,923
I'LL HAVE YOUR WIFE TONIGHT.

328
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:36,957
- WHAT?

329
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,292
- NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.

330
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,427
GET OUT OF HERE.

331
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,529
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT, DAVE?

332
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:45,098
THAT DOG WAS LIKE MY
BEST FRIEND, AND WHEN SHE DIED--

333
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,134
- BRRING BRRING,
BRRING BRRING, BRRING.

334
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,468
HEY, TIFFANY.

335
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,038
YEAH, I DEFINITELY
WANT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

336
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,340
NO, I CAN'T REALLY TALK
RIGHT NOW,

337
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,842
'CAUSE I'M A DATE
WITH THIS DRIP.

338
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,576
YEAH, I CAN ASK.

339
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,545
HEY, DO YOU WANT TO WATCH
A PORNO AFTER THIS

340
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,313
WITH ME AND MY WIFE?

341
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:04,517
- NO, DAVE,
'CAUSE YOU'RE DISGUSTING.

342
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:05,618
- SO IT'S DEFINITELY A NO?

343
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,955
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE BEING SO TERRIBLE.

344
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,556
WE'RE JUST TWO PEOPLE
TRYING TO GO ON A DATE.

345
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,491
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.
IT'S JUST A DATE.

346
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,559
- YOU'RE RIGHT, IT IS.

347
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:13,961
WELL DONE.

348
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,096
SORRY I HAD TO GET
ALL MEDICAL ON YOU,

349
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,431
BUT NOW YOU SEE THAT
EVEN IF EVERYTHING GOES WRONG,

350
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,432
YOU'LL SURVIVE.

351
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:23,570
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

352
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,839
YOU COY BASTARD.

353
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,343
- MARK.

354
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,544
- TOM.

355
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,612
- YOU HATE RON, RIGHT?

356
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,848
- NO, I THINK RON IS FINE.

357
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,183
- SO WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

358
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,550
YOU GOT TO HELP ME
TAKE THIS GUY DOWN.

359
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,252
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING ON HIM.

360
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:42,222
- TOM, I'M STARTING TO FEEL
KIND OF GROSS ABOUT THIS GAME.

361
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,490
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE GAME
ANYMORE.

362
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,959
RON HAS SOME SERIOUS DIRT ON ME.
I NEED TO BALANCE THINGS OUT.

363
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,494
YOU MUST KNOW
HOW THAT FEELS.

364
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:48,595
YOU GOT TONS OF DIRT
IN YOUR PAST.

365
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,297
PLEASE, YOU GOTTA HELP ME.

366
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,236

HE HANGS OUT AT A BAR
IN EAGLETON.

368
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,573
HE'S AN OLD FRIEND
OF RON'S.

369
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,242
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK HIM.

370
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,443
- THANKS, MAN.

371
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,478
I'M GONNA DIG UP
SO MUCH DIRT ON THIS GUY,

372
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,348
THERE'S GONNA BE WORMS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

373
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,885
IT SOUNDED SNAPPIER IN MY HEAD.
- YEAH.

374
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,021

CATCH.

378
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,995
I DON'T NEED YOUR DRESS ANYMORE.

379
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,030
I'M GONNA WEAR
MY OWN STUFF.

380
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,264

381
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:27,100

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
THAT HE'S NOT GONNA LIKE YOU.

385
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,474
HE'S GONNA FREAK OUT
ABOUT HOW AWESOME YOU ARE.

386
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,608
- NO, HE'S NOT.

387
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,477
- YES, HE IS.
HE'S GONNA LOVE YOU.

388
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,346
YOU'RE COOL, AND YOU'RE SEXY,

I'M NOT SCARED.

410
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,493
CAN I COME IN
AND SIT DOWN FOR A BIT?

411
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,728
'CAUSE I WALKED HERE
'CAUSE OF THE DRINKING.

412
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,163
- I DON'T KNOW.

413
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,264
- I DO KNOW.

414
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,066
I'M COMING INSIDE, SO MOVE.
OKAY?

415
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,502
YOU MAKE A BETTER DOOR

SOUND WEIRD.

417

*

431
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,057
- ANN WAS HELPING ME,

432
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,559
BECAUSE I WAS PANICKING
ABOUT TOMORROW.

433
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,395
- DID I SAY SOMETHING
TO MAKE YOU WORRY ABOUT TO--

434
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,665
- NO! NO, JUST THE WHOLE IDEA
OF FIRST DATES

435
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,400
JUST KIND OF FREAK ME OUT.

436
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,634
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

437
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,271
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
THAT I WAS SCARED

438
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,738
TO GO ON A DATE WITH YOU.

439
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,607
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD BE
SCARED OF ME.

440
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,409
- OKAY.

441
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,711
- I THINK I NEED
TO RETURN THIS SWEATER.

442
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,747
I THINK IT FUSED WITH MY SHIRT
IN THE DRYER OR SOMETHING.

443
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:58,718
- I THINK THAT'S
A SWEATER-SHIRT COMBO.

444
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:02,622
- I THINK IT'S GOING
PRETTY WELL WITH DAVE.

445
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:03,723
HE WANTS ME.

446
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,658
I CAN TOTALLY TELL
THAT HE WANTS ME.

447
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,693
- HEY, I'M RIGHT HERE.

448
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,729
YOU KNOW I'M HERE, RIGHT?

449
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,265

450
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,633
BEEP-BOOP.

451
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,834
GUESS WHAT? I'M WEARING
THE HOT ONE TOMORROW,

452
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,336
THE BLACK ONE.
- OKAY.

453
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,437
- CAN I USE YOUR BATHROOM?

454
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,805
- YES.

455
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,240
- ARE YOU IMPRESSED
THAT I KNOW WHAT IT'S CALLED?

456
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,474
- MAYBE I OUGHT
TO GIVE YOU A LIFT HOME.

457
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,644
- OH, GOOD. WELL, IN LONDON,
THEY CALL THE ELEVATORS LIFTS,

458
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,079
SO YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
AN ELEVATOR HOME?

459
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,480
NO, THANK YOU.
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

460
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,683
- [British accent] OKAY.
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE PUB...

461
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,352
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- AND GET A PINT.

462
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,122
WE'LL PUT OUR KNICKERS
IN THE BEATLE RECORDS.

463
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,489
THIS IS AN ENGLISH ACCENT.

464
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:39,426
- WHAT I CANNOT BELIEVE
IS DEXHART'S WIFE.

465
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,294
I MEAN, HOW CLUELESS
CAN YOU GET?

466
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:44,164
HOW DID SHE NOT KNOW
THIS WAS GOING ON?

467
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,533
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
HOW DOES SHE STAY WITH HIM

468
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,101
AFTER ALL THIS?

469
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:52,472
- HEY, CAN I HELP YOU
AT, UH...

470
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,806
11:48 P.M.?

471
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,442
- OKAY, HERE'S THE WHOLE THING.

472
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:56,809
HERE ARE ALL MY SKELETONS.

473
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,812
WHEN I WAS 16, I HAD SEX
WITH A MARRIED WOMAN.

474
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:00,813
- RIGHT.

475
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:01,548
- WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,

476
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,316
I SMOKED A DECENT AMOUNT
OF POT.

477
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,118
- UH-HUH.
- NOTHING INSANE.

478
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,553
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

479
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,720
- WHAT I'M DOING, ANN,
IS I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU

480
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,490
THAT I'VE DONE SOME STUFF
THAT I'M NOT VERY PROUD OF,

481
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,524
AND I LIKE YOU,

482
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,326
SO I WOULD RATHER
YOU NOT FIND OUT ABOUT THIS

483
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,128
FROM ANYONE BUT ME.

484
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,729
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

485
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,730
- [laughs]

486
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,766
NO, NO, IT'S...IT'S FINE.

487
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,568
I GET WHAT THIS IS

488
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,636
AND WHY YOU DID IT.

489
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,406
- IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE

490
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,242
FROM YOUR PAST TO
SORT OF BALANCE THE SCALES?

491
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:32,279
- YEAH. ONE TIME, THIS GUY RANG
MY DOORBELL AT MIDNIGHT

492
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,647
TO BRAG ABOUT GETTING LAID
WHEN HE WAS 16, SO I SHOT HIM.

493
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,350
- GOOD NIGHT.

494
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:40,720
- IT'S BEEN A REAL GIFT MAKING
SONIC LOVE TO YOU TONIGHT.

495
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,922
IF YOU WANT MORE OF THE DUKE,

496
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,724

00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,938
AND MAYBE WE CAN
WALK THROUGH FIRE TOGETHER.

503
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,673
THANK YOU.
GOOD NIGHT

504
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:03,643
[final note,
applause]

505
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:09,416
- DUKE! HUGE FAN.

506
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,256
- LOOK, TOM, I IMAGINE

507
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,590
YOU'LL WANT TO TELL EVERYONE
ABOUT THIS,

508
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,259
BUT I HAVE WORKED
PRETTY HARD

509
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,827
TO CULTIVATE
A CERTAIN AUTHORITATIVE

510
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,695
OR INTIMIDATING IMAGE
AROUND THE OFFICE.

511
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,664
- CAN I GET A PICTURE?
- SURE.

512
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,266
- SAY, "I BESTED YOU."

513
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,269
- I BESTED YOU.

514
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,238
- ALL RIGHT.
THANKS FOR LOVIN' THE DUKE.

515
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,340
- THAT--
THAT WAS A LOVELY PHOTO.

516
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,807
- TRUCE?

517
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,943
- TRUCE.

518
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,811
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

519
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,513
- NO, I'M NOT.

520
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:41,848
- YOU SHOWED UP
AT THE GUY'S HOUSE,

521
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,217
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
DRUNK,

522
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,852
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN SLEEP
WITH HIM?

523
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,388
- SHOULD I HAVE?
- IT NEVER HURTS.

524
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,956
- GOD.

525
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,591
- HEY.

526
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,692
- HEY.

527
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,894
- HEY!

528
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,896
- UH, AHEM, YOU, UH...

529
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,965
YOU LEFT QUITE A BIT OF STUFF
AT MY PLACE LAST NIGHT--

530
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,435
PURSE AND EARRINGS
AND A SHOE.

531
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:04,237
- I AM SO SORRY
FOR WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

532
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,705
ON MY LIST
OF EMBARRASSING THINGS

533
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,007
THAT I'VE DONE IN MY LIFE,
THAT WAS...

534
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,909
NUMBERS ONE THROUGH SEVEN.

535
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,545
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
IF YOU WANT TO CANCEL.

536
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,314
- IT'S OKAY. YOU CAN MAKE IT UP
TO ME TONIGHT

537
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,582
ON OUR SECOND DATE.

538
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:16,949
- SECOND?

539
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,319
- WELL, YEAH, LAST NIGHT
WAS OUR FIRST DATE,

540
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,620
SO THAT WOULD MAKE TONIGHT
OUR SECOND.

541
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,355
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

542
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,990
8:00?

543
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,325
- 8:00.

544
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,527
- YOU LIKE DANCING?

545
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,728
- YEAH.

546
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,263
- I DON'T LIKE DANCING.

547
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:31,398
- WE DON'T HAVE TO GO.
- OKAY.

548
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,466
- WELL, WE WENT
ON OUR FIRST DATE,

549
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,670
AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT,
A.K.A. I NAILED IT.

550
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,972
NO FIRES, NO AMBULANCES.

551
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,741
JUST GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
SHOWING UP DRUNK

552
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,511
AT A GUY'S HOUSE
LATE AT NIGHT.

553
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,449
- HOWEVER, I WANT TO BE CLEAR.

554
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,884
I HAVE NO PLANS
TO RESIGN.

555
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,487
- IS IT WEIRD
THAT MY FEELINGS ARE HURT

556
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:57,724
THAT NO ONE'S FOUND
ANY DIRT ON ME YET?

557
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,559
HELLO!

558
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,729
I DROVE A RIDING LAWN MOWER
THROUGH A NORDSTROM!

559
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,832
THERE'S VIDEO THAT I TOOK!

560
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,837
NOTHING.

561
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,873
- JERRY, PLASTIC SURGERY?

562
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,546
- I GOT HIT
BY A FIRE ENGINE.

563
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,514
- YOU ARE SO LUCKY.

564
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:22,815
- HOW?
