1
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,471
- OKAY, AS EVERYBODY KNOWS,

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:06,640
THE SPIRIT OF PAWNEE
WAS DEFACED AGAIN LAST NIGHT.

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,142
- WHAT WAS IT THIS TIME?

4
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:10,711
- CHOCOLATE PUDDING.
- HUH. THAT'S NEW.

5
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,680
THE MURAL THAT NORMALLY
RESIDES HERE

6
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:15,383
IS CALLED
THE SPIRIT OF PAWNEE,

7
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,684
AND IT'S VERY CONTROVERSIAL.

8
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:20,121
WE'VE HAD SOMEONE
THROW ACID AT IT, TOMATO SAUCE.

9
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,722
SOMEONE
TRIED TO STAB IT ONCE.

10
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,825
WE REALLY NEED
BETTER SECURITY HERE.

11
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:29,097
WE ALSO NEED...
BETTER, LESS-OFFENSIVE HISTORY.

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,564
- SO THE CITY COUNCIL
HAS DECIDED

13
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,600
THAT THE SPIRIT OF PAWNEE
SHOULD BE CHANGED

14
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,303
TO SOMETHING JUST
A LITTLE LESS HORRIFYING.

15
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:38,472
NOW SINCE THE MURALS WERE MADE
BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES

16
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:40,374
BACK IN THE 1930s,

17
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:43,244
WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE FUN
IF EACH DEPARTMENT

18
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,713
SUBMITTED THE DESIGN
FOR A NEW MURAL...

19
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:49,183
AND YOU'LL SUBMIT YOUR CONCEPTS
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

20
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,719
ALL RIGHTY, FOLKS?
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,454
- UH, LESLIE, WHAT'S YOUR
DESIGN GONNA BE?

22
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:54,622
A TREE?

23
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,457
- JOE, YOU WORK IN SEWAGE.

24
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,127
YOUR DEPARTMENT LITERALLY
SPECIALIZES IN CRAP.

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,828
YOU REALLY WANNA DO THIS?
- I TOLD YOU BEFORE.

26
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:04,498
CRAP IS A SLANG TERM,
AND I DON'T LIKE THAT TERM.

27
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:07,801
BUT AT LEAST WE DON'T SPECIALIZE
IN LOSING...LIKE YOU GUYS.

28
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,737
SEWAGE, LET'S ROLL.

29
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,205
- DAMN!

30
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,674
HOW DOES SEWAGE ALWAYS GET
THE HOTTEST INTERNS?

31
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,677
[optimistic music]

32
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:24,718
*

33
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,474
- GUYS, THIS DEPARTMENT
HAS THE CHANCE

34
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:49,777
TO DESIGN SOMETHING THAT COULD
BE IN THIS BUILDING FOREVER.

35
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,379
THIS COULD BE OUR LEGACY.

36
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:52,580
- I THOUGHT BUILDING A PARK
ON LOT 48

37
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,215
WAS GONNA BE OUR LEGACY.

38
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:55,649
- WELL, YOU CAN HAVE
TWO LEGACIES.

39
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,585
LOOK AT MADONNA--
GREAT SINGER, AMAZING ARMS.

40
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,852
- LOOK AT O.J. SIMPSON--

41
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:00,921
HEISMAN TROPHY WINNER,
NAKED GUN.

42
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,690
- MM-HMM.
- NO OFFENSE, LESLIE,

43
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:05,259
BUT I'M NOT AN ARTIST.
- OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE, DONNA.

44
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:08,729
I'VE SEEN YOUR FINGERNAILS.
- I PAY SOMEONE TO DO THIS.

45
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,931
- REALLY? OH. WELL...

46
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,766
SHOOT.
ANYWAY...

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,269
I'M ORDERING ALL OF YOU
TO DESIGN A MURAL.

48
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:16,904
- AH...ONLY RON CAN ORDER
THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT

49
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,539
TO DO SOMETHING.

50
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,742
- RON, ORDER THEM TO DO THIS.
- DO WHATEVER LESLIE SAYS.

51
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,877
- HA HA! OKAY.
SO HERE ARE YOUR SUPPLIES.

52
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:26,447
I WANT YOU TO GO AND FIND
THE SPIRIT OF PAWNEE

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,648
AND MAKE ME A SKETCH.

54
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:31,385
AND IT NEEDS TO BE BREATHTAKING
AND MOVING AND HISTORICAL

55
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:32,586
AND BETTER
THAN EVERY DEPARTMENT,

56
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,588
AND YOU HAVE ONE HOUR.

57
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,725
[drawling voice]
DESIGNERS, MAKE IT WORK.

58
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,428
TIM GUNN.

59
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,663
- YOU, MY FRIEND,
ARE READY TO GO DANCING.

60
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,565
THANK YOU, SIR.

61
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:45,533
ALL RIGHT, NEXT.
[snaps]

62
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,936
- ANDREW, LOOKING GOOD.
BUSINESS IS BOOMING.

63
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,604
- YEAH. HEY, RON,
HOW ABOUT YOU?

64
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,373
NEED A LITTLE DOG WAXIN'?

65
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,742
IT'S ONLY 5 BUCKS, AND I'LL LET
YOU CUT IN FRONT OF THIS GUY.

66
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,277
- WHAT?
- COME ON, BEAT IT.

67
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,312
THIS IS RON SWANSON
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

68
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:00,781
- I'M IMPRESSED WITH ANDY.

69
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,217
PULLING HIMSELF UP
BY HIS BOOTSTRAPS.

70
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,486
REMINDS ME OF ME.

71
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,221
I GOT MY FIRST JOB
WHEN I WAS NINE.

72
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:08,922
WORKED AT A SHEET METAL
FACTORY.

73
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:12,593
IN TWO WEEKS,
I WAS RUNNING THE FLOOR.

74
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:16,530
CHILD LABOR LAWS
ARE RUINING THIS COUNTRY.

75
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,335
- DO YOU HAVE A KEY
IN YOUR SHOE?

76
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,737
- NO, NO, I HAVE A BUNION
THAT'S PRACTICALLY ITS OWN TOE.

77
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,939
NORMALLY, THE PAIN
HOWLS THROUGH MY LOAFERS

78
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,908
LIKE A BANSHEE ON THE MOORS,

79
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,943
BUT...FOR THESE
PAST THREE MINUTES,

80
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,979
IT'S BEEN REDUCED
TO A FAINT GROWL.

81
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,615
- OKAY.

82
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:35,683
THAT WAS NEAT.

83
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,752
WELL, HEY.
WE ARE ALL FINISHED.

84
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,289
- WELL...[grunts]

85
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,956
WHOO.
THAT WAS GREAT.

86
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,527
- THANK YOU, SON.
- NO SWEAT!

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,728
NEXT!

88
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,497
- SHOULDN'T LET YOUR FRIENDS
CUT IN LINE.

89
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,431
IT'S NOT GOOD BUSINESS.

90
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,933
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
ISN'T GOOD BUSINESS?

91
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,002
THAT GUY'S MY FRIEND.

92
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,471
- RIGHT.
I'M SAYING...

93
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:58,972
YOU SHOULDN'T
LET YOUR FRIENDS CUT IN LINE.

94
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,541
- ALL RIGHT.
SORRY, KYLE.

95
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,942
HERE, GIVE ME THIS.

96
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:02,843
NEXT!

97
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,813
- SO WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR EXACTLY?

98
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,715
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

99
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,751
THE SPIRIT OF PAWNEE.
THAT'S ALL I GOT.

100
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,886
HERE. JUST GIMME
$20 WORTH OF ART.

101
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,688
JUST SOMETHING
THAT SEEMS PERSONAL

102
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,457
THAT ONLY I COULD HAVE DONE.

103
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,828
- WELL, TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.
- NO. JUST PAINT.

104
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,797
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN ART.
LET ME CLARIFY.

105
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,734
I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN NON-NUDE IMAGES.

106
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,437
DUDE, WHAT THE HELL
KIND OF ART IS THIS?

107
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,539
LOOKS LIKE A LIZARD
PUKING UP SKITTLES!

108
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,607
- I'M AN ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST.

109
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,742
- NO, YOU'RE A CON ARTIST,

110
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,411
AND I'M A GUY
THAT'S OUT 20 BUCKS.

111
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,679
UGH. WHATEVER.

112
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:39,680
- I'M A TERRIBLE ARTIST.

113
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,650
BUT THE PARKS DEPARTMENT
HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR ME

114
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,919
THAT IF I CAN HELP THEM OUT
IN ANY WAY, I WILL.

115
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,855
OH, GOD.

116
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:51,525
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GIVE THEM
ALL FREE FLU SHOTS.

117
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,060
- I KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT THIS TOWN

118
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,695
AND THESE MURALS,

119
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,431
AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS
A DREAM COME TRUE--LITERALLY.

120
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,933
I HAVE HAD A DREAM
WHERE I DESIGNED A MURAL.

121
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,602
BUT THEN IT TURNED INTO
A NIGHTMARE

122
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,371
BECAUSE THE MURAL
STARTED TALKING,

123
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,772
AND IT CAME ALIVE,
AND IT WAS WHISPERING,

124
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,574
AND I COULDN'T HEAR
WHAT IT WAS SAYING,

125
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,410
SO I LEANED IN CLOSE,
AND THEN IT ATE ME.

126
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:12,012
AT ONE POINT,
GINA GERSHON WAS THERE.

127
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,782
- MY PIECE
IS TRULY GOING TO CAPTURE

128
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,518
THE SPIRIT OF PAWNEE.

129
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,454
EEW!

130
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:23,524
- NEVER UNDERSTOOD
THE TERM ELBOW GREASE.

131
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,759
I GUESS
IT'S NOT REALLY GREASE.

132
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,028
JUST HARD WORK.

133
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,700
OH, HEY, RON.
NICE SHINY SHOES YOU GOT THERE.

134
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,001
- OH, HEY, I WAS JUST, UM...

135
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,537
OH, NO--SHOOT.

136
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,807
ACTUALLY, IT LOOKS LIKE
I SCUFFED THIS ONE.

137
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,975
- DO YOU NEED YOUR MONEY
BACK, RON?

138
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,711
- 'CAUSE I ALREADY SPENT IT.
- REALLY?

139
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,846
HOW DID--NEVER MIND.

140
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,950
UH, I THINK I'LL JUST TAKE
ANOTHER FULL POLISH.

141
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,785
CAN I CUT IN LINE AGAIN?

142
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,121
- I FEEL RIGHT AT HOME
AS A SHOESHINE.

143
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,923
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M DOING,

144
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,827
BUT I KNOW I'M DOING IT
REALLY, REALLY WELL.

145
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,531
- OKAY, LET'S GET GOIN'
WITH THE SPIRIT OF PAWNEE.

146
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,567
ANN, YOU GO FIRST.
- OKAY.

147
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,636
UM...OKAY.

148
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,505
WELL, SINCE IT'S
THE PARKS DEPARTMENT,

149
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,807
I THOUGHT I WOULD DESIGN
A PRETTY PARK.

150
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,444
WITH, UH, DOGS PLAYING.

151
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:17,711
I CAN'T REALLY DRAW,

152
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:20,748
SO I JUST CUT SOME STUFF
OUT OF A MAGAZINE.

153
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,683
- THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
A DEATH ROW CONVICT

154
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,051
WOULD MAKE IN ART THERAPY.

155
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,053
- DUDE, I TRIED.

156
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,855
- AND YOU FAILED.

157
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,691
- IT'S DOGS AND PEOPLE
PLAYING IN A PARK.

158
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,992
- IT'S CUTE!
- IT'S OKAY, SWEETHEART.

159
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,695
YOU CAN'T MAKE ART
BECAUSE YOU ARE ART.

160
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,631
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL...
BUT THAT SUCKS.

161
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:39,767
- OKAY. LET'S SEE YOURS!

162
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,772
- FINE. MINE IS AMAZING.
IT'S GONNA BLOW YOUR MIND.

163
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,879
OKAY. SOME PROFESSIONAL-ASS
ART RIGHT HERE.

164
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,681
- I'M NOT QUITE SURE
WHAT I'M LOOKING AT.

165
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,616
- IT'S ABSTRACT, LESLIE.

166
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,018
OVER HERE,
YOU GOT SOME SHAPES.

167
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:01,655
AND THEN YOU COME
OVER TO THIS SIDE...

168
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,057
YOU KNOW, IT'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF INTERESTING.

169
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,528
EACH SHAPE
IS ITS OWN THING...

170
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:10,598
BUT THEN WHEN IT COMES
TOGETHER,

171
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:14,535
IT REALLY GIVES YOU
A SENSE OF...

172
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,604
COMPLETION.

173
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,472
HMM.

174
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:21,642
A PIECE OF ART CAUSED ME
TO HAVE AN EMOTIONAL REACTION.

175
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,711
IS THAT NORMAL?

176
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,979
- SO IT'S THE LAST SUPPER

177
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,916
BUT WITH FAMOUS PEOPLE
FROM INDIANA.

178
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,685
JOHN MELLANCAMP,
LARRY BIRD,

179
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:32,953
MICHAEL JACKSON,

180
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:36,223
DAVID LETTERMAN,
VIVICA A. FOX.

181
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,759
OKAY, SO HERE'S WHERE
IT GETS A LITTLE DICEY,

182
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,028
'CAUSE THERE'S NOT THAT MANY
CELEBRITIES FROM INDIANA,

183
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,497
SO, UM, A NASCAR,

184
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:47,701
MY FRIEND BECKY,
RON SWANSON, UH...

185
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:50,103
- DONNA?
WHO'S THE JESUS?

186
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,939
- THAT WOULD BE GREG KINNEAR.

187
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,107
- I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS FROM INDIANA.

188
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,544
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I READ THAT HE WAS.

189
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,546
- DO YOU THINK
HE'S THE BEST CHOICE FOR JESUS?

190
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,013
I MEAN,
HE WAS GREAT ON ER...

191
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,015
- GREG KINNEAR WASN'T IN ER.
- YEAH, HE WAS.

192
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,151
- I DON'T THINK THAT HE WAS.

193
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:07,254
- WHO AM I THINKING OF?

194
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,989
OKAY. NEXT.

195
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,692
- [exhales]

196
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,661
[clears throat]

197
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,563
- WOW. REALLY GOOD, JERRY.

198
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,197
- FOR MY MURINAL,

199
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,132
I WAS INSPIRED
BY THE DEATH OF MY GRANDMA--

200
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,934
- [laughing]
YOU SAID "MURINAL."

201
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,235
[laughter]

202
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,704
- NO, I DIDN'T.
- YES, YOU DID.

203
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:24,838
YOU SAID "MURINAL."
I HEARD IT.

204
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,840
- ANYWAY, SHE--
- JERRY...

205
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,809
WHY DON'T YOU PUT THAT MURINAL
IN THE MEN'S ROOM

206
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,744
SO PEOPLE CAN MURINATE
ALL OVER IT?

207
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,746
[laughter]
- JERRY.

208
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,014
GO TO THE DOCTOR.

209
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,617
YOU MIGHT HAVE
A MURINARY TRACT INFECTION.

210
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,951
- JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU
MY ART.

211
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,854
all, chanting:
MURINAL, MURINAL, MURINAL!

212
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:44,157
- DISQUALIFIED!
[laughter]

213
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,693
- IT'S POINTILLISM.

214
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,596
AND EACH DOT IS A PHOTO
OF A CITIZEN OF THE TOWN.

215
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,964
- NO ONE CARES.
AT ALL.

216
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,132
[laughing]

217
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,336
- OKAY, SO THIS IS
A MULTIMEDIA PROJECT.

218
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,640
FIRST...A BUNCH OF RATS
MADE OUT OF GARBAGE.

219
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,341
AND, UM...

220
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,710
THIS IS A TV SCREEN.

221
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,177
IT'LL BE LIKE
A BIG FLAT SCREEN TV,

222
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,681
AND IT'LL PLAY LOOPED VIDEO
OF KNEE SURGERIES.

223
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,750
AND THEN THIS IS
A HUMAN-SIZED HAMSTER WHEEL

224
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:10,684
THAT WILL BE NEXT
TO THE MURAL,

225
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:13,220
IF WE CAN GET ONE,
AND IT'LL BE SPINNING,

226
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,088
AND THERE'LL BE LIKE
A FAT GUY IN IT ALL THE TIME

227
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,924
LIKE SCREAMING
AND LIKE EATING RAW BEEF

228
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,592
AND LIKE BLEEDING,

229
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,661
AND LIKE BLOOD WILL COME
OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND STUFF.

230
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:25,232
AND THAT'LL BE LIKE
RIGHT NEXT TO...THE MURAL.

231
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,735
- I HAVE ONE QUESTION.

232
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:28,669
WHY?

233
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,104
- IF YOU HAVE TO ASK,
YOU DON'T GET IT.

234
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,707
- I DON'T THINK THEY
REALLY GOT THE ASSIGNMENT.

235
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,743
IF WE'RE GONNA BEAT
ALL THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS,

236
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:39,146
WE HAVE TO CHOOSE SOMETHING THAT
WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME...

237
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:43,083
LIKE THE MONA LISA
OR THE MUSIC OF SQUEEZE.

238
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,820
JUNE 8, 1922.

239
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:49,322
THE PAWNEE BREAD FACTORY
BURNED TO THE GROUND.

240
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,892
WE LOST A LOT OF GOOD BREAD
THAT DAY...

241
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,728
AS WELL AS
SEVERAL HUMAN LIVES.

242
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:57,631
AND IT ALSO MADE THE WHOLE
TOWN SMELL LIKE TOAST,

243
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:01,101
WHICH ONE RESIDENT DESCRIBED
AS "DISTURBINGLY ENTICING."

244
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,670
BUT I DIGRESS.

245
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,872
THE POINT IS,
WE REBUILT PAWNEE

246
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,306
TO THE WONDERFUL TOWN
THAT IT IS TODAY.

247
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,309
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT A MURAL
THAT SHOWS PEOPLE DYING

248
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,279
WHEN YOU COULD HAVE SHAPES
THAT COME ALIVE?

249
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,947
- WELL, BECAUSE
IT'S THE MOST FAMOUS EVENT

250
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,315
IN OUR TOWN'S HISTORY,

251
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,718
AND PEOPLE
LOVE VOTING FOR TRAGEDY.

252
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:21,388
LOOK AT THE OSCARS.
THIS IS OUR HOLOCAUST MOVIE.

253
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,791
THIS IS OUR ENGLISH PATIENT.

254
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,694
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
EXPLOITING THE TRAGEDY.

255
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,797
- SEE? ANN GETS IT.
OKAY...TIME TO VOTE, EVERYBODY.

256
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,931
CAST YOUR VOTES!

257
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:35,168
MAY THE BEST,
MOST TRAGIC PROJECT WIN.

258
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:38,305
WHEN WE STARTED THIS,
WE WERE SIX DIFFERENT VOICES

259
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,240
WITH SIX IDEAS FOR A MURAL.

260
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,443
AND THEN THOSE SIX VOICES
CAME TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

261
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,746
THERE ARE NO LOSERS TODAY.

262
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,849
BUT THERE IS
ONE WINNER. US.

263
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,317
THE PARKS DEPARTMENT.

264
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,120
TOM, THE RESULTS
OF THE VOTE, PLEASE.

265
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,989
- ONE TO ONE TO ONE
TO ONE TO ONE TO ONE.

266
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:59,092
- WE ALL VOTED
FOR OURSELVES, DIDN'T WE?

267
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,396
- YEAH. OKAY.

268
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,736
- [softly]
THIRD TIME TODAY.

269
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,905
- MM. THAT'S
A GOOD SHOESHINE.

270
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:19,079
MM-MM!
[groans] OHH...

271
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,815
MM!

272
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:32,726
- AH HA HA HA!
EHH!

273
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,828
WHAT THE [bleep], MAN?

274
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:37,865
- I D-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

275
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,066
FRANKLY.

276
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,368
- I EMITTED A NOISE.

277
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:46,874
THE NOISE WAS INVOLUNTARY.

278
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,877
SOMETIMES A SOUND
IS JUST A SOUND, YOU KNOW?

279
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,880
- WE NEED TO WHITTLE
THESE DOWN.

280
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,949
CAN WE ALL AGREE ON ELIMINATING
ANY OF THESE DESIGNS?

281
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:59,152
- ANN'S BLOWS.
- WOW. DON'T HOLD BACK.

282
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,754
- NO OFFENSE, BUT IT'S
A GIANT PICTURE OF A PARK.

283
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,222
THAT'S NOT ART.

284
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:05,492
- WELL, AT LEAST IT'S NOT
A FAT HUMAN HAMSTER EATING MEAT.

285
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,527
- YOU DON'T EVEN WORK HERE!
- OKAY, GUYS.

286
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,231
YOU BOTH HAVE A POINT.
ANN, YOURS WAS A LITTLE TRITE.

287
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,534
AND, APRIL, YOURS WAS HELLISH
AND MIGHT MAKE SOMEONE VOMIT.

288
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,837
- THANK YOU.

289
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,006
- LOOK, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THOSE SHAPES.

290
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,407
THERE'S SOME EMOTIONAL ART
RIGHT THERE.

291
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,776
- ANY KID COULD DO THAT.
- NO KID COULD DO THAT!

292
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,244
ONLY GOD COULD DO THAT!

293
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,847
- WHAT IS SO GREAT
ABOUT THE SHAPES?

294
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,449
- HE LIKES THE SHAPES, OKAY?
AND HE'S PART OF THE TEAM.

295
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,884
SO HERE, TAKE THESE SCISSORS

296
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,286
AND CUT OUT
YOUR FAVORITE SHAPES.

297
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,791
AND THEN WE'LL PUT THEM
ON A NEW TEAM MURAL.

298
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:39,559
WE'RE GONNA MAKE A NEW DESIGN

299
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,096
THAT TAKES THE BEST PARTS
OF ALL OF OUR DESIGNS.

300
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,367
IT'S LIKE IF YOU GOT
MICHELANGELO AND ANDY WARHOL

301
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,171
AND JACKSON POLLOCK
AND JIM DAVIS FROM GARFIELD

302
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,841
TO DO ONE PAINTING.

303
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,909
IMAGINE HOW GOOD
THAT PAINTING WOULD BE!

304
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:02,282
I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD.

305
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,955
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

306
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,323
BRENDANAWICZ,
WE NEED YOU FOR SOMETHING.

307
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:12,860
- CAN IT WAIT?
I AM SO SWAMPED HERE.

308
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,362
- ANN'S IN TROUBLE.

309
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,998
WE THINK IT MIGHT BE PILLS.
- WHAT?

310
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:21,401
- NO. THAT'S A LIE.
BUT THIS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT.

311
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,603
WE NEED YOU TO LOOK AT
A PIECE OF ART.

312
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,840
- OH, GOD.

313
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,341
WHAT IS THAT?

314
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,878
- THIS IS OUR ENTRY
FOR THE MURAL CONTEST.

315
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,612
WE COULDN'T DECIDE
ON ONE DESIGN,

316
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,415
SO WE TOOK PARTS
THAT WE ALL LIKED OF OUR DESIGNS

317
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,117
AND THEN WE JUST KIND OF...

318
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,387
SMOOSHED IT INTO A THING.

319
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,590
- WELL, YOU MADE A CAMEL.

320
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,326
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THAT SAYING?

321
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,561
A CAMEL IS ACTUALLY A HORSE
DESIGNED BY A COMMITTEE,

322
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:52,866
AND WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE HERE
IS ONE UGLY CAMEL...

323
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,634
FEATURING BILL PAXTON.

324
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,236
- GREG KINNEAR.
- RIGHT. GREG KINNEAR.

325
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,138
- OH! IS BILL PAXTON
FROM INDIANA?

326
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,908
- YOU HAVE TO SAVE US.
YOU HAVE TO DESIGN SOMETHING.

327
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,610
- LESLIE, I'M NOT AN ARTIST.
- YES, YOU ARE.

328
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,113
I'VE SEEN YOU SKETCH THINGS.
- UH, YEAH.

329
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,647
LIKE POLES FOR STOP SIGNS.

330
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,549
- THAT EVERYBODY STOPS
AND LOOKS AT.

331
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,318
- BY LAW, LESLIE.
THEY'RE REQUIRED TO.

332
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,519
- LOOK, MARK, PLEASE.

333
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,188
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE OF US
WHO'S ACTUALLY GOT ANY TALENT.

334
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:16,589
I KNOW
YOU'LL DO SOMETHING GOOD.

335
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:18,926
AND I REALLY,
REALLY WANT TO WIN THIS.

336
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,627
PLEASE?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TONIGHT?

337
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,597
- I WAS GONNA GO TO ARBY'S
AND WATCH FRONTLINE.

338
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:33,406
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.

339
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,645
- OKAY, SO...IT IS AN OLD MAN
FEEDING PIGEONS IN A PARK.

340
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,648
UH...THE SPIRIT OF PAWNEE,
MAYBE?

341
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:42,582
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

342
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,584
- HOW IS THAT BETTER
THAN MY PARK SCENE?

343
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,453
- IT ISN'T.
AND THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING.

344
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,655
- AND WHO'S THE MAN?
IS HE FAMOUS?

345
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,623
IS IT MARTIN LANDAU?

346
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,325
- LOOK, I HAVE NO DOG
IN THIS FIGHT.

347
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,927
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT THIS'LL WIN.

348
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,628
- IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S MUSH!

349
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,397
THERE'S NOT EVEN ONE SHAPE
IN THERE, MARK!

350
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,665
WHERE ARE THE SHAPES?

351
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,467
- I'M NOT SAYING
THIS IS ANY GOOD.

352
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,602
I'M SAYING THAT THIS'LL WIN.
IT'S MASS APPEAL.

353
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,406
IT'S LIKE WHAT MOTELS PUT UP,
AND IT HANGS THERE FOR YEARS,

354
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,275
AND NO ONE EVER THROWS ACID
AT IT.

355
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,443
- MM. WHO DID THIS?
I LIKE IT.

356
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,446
- SERIOUSLY?
I MEAN--

357
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,481
[whispers]
SORRY!

358
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:18,351
- YEAH. IT COMFORTS ME.

359
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:21,121
THAT'LL WIN.

360
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,689
- THIS IS...

361
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:23,523
GARBAGE!

362
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,492
WE'VE GOTTA GO BACK
TO THE SHAPES.

363
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,694
- NO, THIS IS BORING--WE'VE
GOT TO GO BACK TO THE GARBAGE.

364
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,562
- I WOULD TAKE THE SHAPES
OVER THIS--I MEAN, COME ON!

365
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,164
- I WOULDN'T TAKE THE SHAPES
OVER ANYTHING.

366
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,066
I'D TAKE JERRY'S MURINAL
OVER THIS.

367
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,701
- NO, GUYS...

368
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,569
THIS IS THE ONE.
- WHAT?

369
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,338
- SORRY. MARK'S RIGHT.
- THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!

370
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,140
MARK'S NOT EVEN
IN THE DEPARTMENT.

371
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,142
- NEITHER IS ANN.
- BUT ANN'S HOT.

372
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,610
AND THAT COUNTS FOR SOMETHING.

373
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,512
- WHATEVER HAPPENED TO,
"WE'RE THE PARKS DEPARTMENT.

374
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,313
"RAH, RAH, RAH.

375
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,981
DOWN WITH
THE SEWAGE DEPARTMENT"?

376
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:50,683
- YEAH, WE SPENT ALL DAY HERE
FOR NO REASON!

377
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,019
- WE HAVE A REASON!
WE'RE GONNA WIN.

378
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,353
THAT'S OUR REASON!

379
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:56,523
OUR DESIGNS ARE NOT GONNA WIN.
MARK'S MIGHT WIN!

380
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,558
HOW GREAT WOULD IT BE
IF WE WON, YOU GUYS?

381
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,460
YOU'LL FEEL A LOT BETTER,
I PROMISE YOU,

382
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:01,361
AFTER YOU WIN.

383
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,630
WE'RE GOIN' WITH THIS ONE.
- [groaning]

384
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,298
- I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE PRESENTATION TOMORROW.

385
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,400
THAT IS AN ORDER, TEAM.

386
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,369
GO, TEAM!

387
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,304
TEAM DISMISSED.

388
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,274
YES, WE ARE A TEAM,
BUT I AM THE TEAM LEADER.

389
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,676
SO I MADE A BOLD DECISION.

390
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,645
WE'RE PLAYING IT SAFE.

391
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,221
- HEY, KNOPE.

392
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,323
HOW'S LIFE
IN THE PARKS DE-FART-MENT?

393
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,592
- BETTER THAN LIFE
IN THE SEWAGE DE-FART-MENT.

394
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,162
WHICH MAKES MORE SENSE.
- WHATEVER!

395
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:39,499
YOU GUYS ARE SCREWED.
GET USED TO THIS.

396
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,368
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE
HANGIN' ON THE WALL

397
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,602
RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR

398
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:46,639
FOR THE NEXT 100 YEARS!

399
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,111
- THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

400
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,646
YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA WIN?
- NO.

401
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,616
NO. THEY WENT SUPER-PATRIOTIC.
IT'S A CLASSIC MISTAKE.

402
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,252
IT SEEMS CROWD-PLEASING,
BUT IT'S STILL A STANCE.

403
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,653
AND IN GOVERNMENT,

404
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,123
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE
WHO'LL OPPOSE A STANCE.

405
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,393
US...OLD MAN FEEDING PIGEONS--
NO STANCE.

406
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:09,262
ABSOLUTELY NO POINT OF VIEW
WHATSOEVER.

407
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,264
- NO POINT OF VIEW.
SMART.

408
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,435
- NO. I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK.

409
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:18,705
I WISH HIM GOOD LUCK
IN HIS BUSINESS,

410
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:21,574
AND, YES, I WILL
ABSOLUTELY GO BACK

411
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,544
TO GET MY SHOES SHINED SOON.

412
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:28,748
I DON'T FRANKLY SEE
WHY THIS IS A TOPIC

413
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,551
FOR DISCUSSION.

414
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,095
- HEY.

415
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,533
OH, HEY, RON.

416
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,668
WHAT'S UP?
- UH...

417
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,438
ANDY...

418
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,640
YOU KNOW THE, UH,
THE THING?

419
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:57,110
THE OTHER DAY?
- OTHER DAY...OTHER DAY...

420
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,611
OH, UH...YESTERDAY?

421
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,613
- I AM...

422
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:01,681
THAT WAS--THAT WAS--

423
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,551
- YOU KNOW,
I'D BE OKAY IF WE...

424
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,653
[clears throat]

425
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,789
[whispers] I'D BE OKAY IF WE
NEVER MENTIONED IT AGAIN.

426
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,624
- NEVER MENTIONED WHAT AGAIN?

427
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,826
- THE MOAN, RON.

428
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,263
THE WEIRD MOAN YOU MADE
THAT WAS SUPER-WEIRD?

429
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,530
DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THAT?

430
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,200
I TALKED ABOUT IT WITH THE LADY
WHO WENT AFTER YOU FOR 1/2 HOUR.

431
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,402
SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT
IT WAS AN ANIMAL--

432
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,171
- OKAY.

433
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,638
IT WAS JUST AN ODD MOMENT.

434
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,907
LET'S JUST NOT
TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

435
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,576
- THAT'S WHAT
I WAS TRYING TO SAY.

436
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,179
BUT, YEAH...OKAY.

437
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,647
- OKAY.
- GOOD JOB.

438
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,356
- MISS KNOPE.
- CHIEF KONNER.

439
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,358
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?

440
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:46,693
- WELL, WE AREN'T REALLY
ARTISTS,

441
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,628
BUT WE GAVE IT A SHOT.

442
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,631
IT'S YOUR BASIC
DOGS PLAYING POKER, BUT...

443
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,434
WITH AN-EVERYTHING'S-ON-FIRE
THEME.

444
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,636
THIS IS MY NEPHEW OVER HERE.
- MM.

445
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,473
- AND THIS IS AN ATTRACTIVE LADY
WITH A HAMBURGER FOR A HEAD.

446
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,309
JUST SOME STUFF WE LIKE,
YOU KNOW?

447
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,711
ANYWAY, WE HAD A LOT OF FUN
PUTTING IT TOGETHER.

448
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:05,845
[laughs]

449
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,380
- WELL, GOOD LUCK!
- THANKS.

450
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,582
WE THINK IT'S A WINNER.

451
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,590
- GO AHEAD.
- WHAT?

452
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:21,661
- THE CAMEL'S WAY MORE FUN.

453
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,463
- I WANT MY TEAM BACK.

454
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:27,534
AND MY TEAM MADE THIS
HOT, CRAZY CAMEL MESS.

455
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,536
SO THIS IS WHAT
WE'RE GONNA SUBMIT,

456
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,903
EVEN IF IT MEANS WE LOSE.

457
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:34,207
GOD, I HOPE WE WIN.
BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA LOSE.

458
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,708
- PROBABLY.
- ALL RIGHT!

459
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,577
LET'S GET IN THERE AND SHOW 'EM
HOW PARKS GETS IT DONE!

460
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,546
- AND ANN!
HOW ANN GETS IT DONE!

461
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:43,250
- YES.
- LET'S GO!

462
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,618
[pen clicking]

463
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:48,588
[click click click click]

464
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:49,589
- WHAT ARE THE SHAPES?

465
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,592
- THE SHAPES ARE AWESOME,
IS WHAT THEY ARE.

466
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,593
YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT.

467
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:56,696
- NO, I-I ACTUALLY LIKE THEM.
- FORGIVE ME.

468
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,631
IS THAT MICHAEL JACKSON?

469
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,667
- HEE HEE--YES.
THE PRIDE OF INDIANA.

470
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,002
- THAT'S RIGHT.
SO IT'S RELEVANT.

471
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,306
- WHO IS HE CARRYING?
- JESUS GREG KINNEAR.

472
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,641
- YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S CARRYING KINNEAR

473
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,410
INTO THE BURNING BUILDING.

474
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:13,680
- OH, WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
HE'S MOONWALKING.

475
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:18,318
SO HE, UM...SHOULD BE
GOIN' THE OTHER WAY.

476
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,720
THAT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME.
- [laughing]

477
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,556
[laughter]

478
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,725
- SORRY.
- SO THERE YOU GO.

479
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,960
THE SPIRIT OF PAWNEE.

480
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,329
WE DIDN'T WIN.

481
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,698
BUT NEITHER DID ANYONE ELSE.

482
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,333
THEY REALIZED IT WAS GONNA
COST A TON OF MONEY

483
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,567
TO HIRE A MURALIST.

484
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,703
SO THEY'RE JUST GONNA
RESTORE THE OLD ONE.

485
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,707
THEY'RE CHANGING THE TITLE
TO THE DIVERSITY EXPRESS.

486
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,674
OH, WELL.

487
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,676
- [laughs] AW!
- YAY.

488
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,680
- YAY!
- AH! LOOK AT THAT.

489
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,285
- NO, NO! IT'S NOT
AS GOOD AS THE OTHER ONE.

490
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,620
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU MEAN BY GOOD.

491
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:56,589
- NEITHER DO I!
JUST DO ANOTHER ONE!

492
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,057
- YOU KNOW,
I HAVE ACTUAL ASSIGNMENTS

493
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,792
THAT I HAVE TO FINISH
FOR ART SCHOOL.

494
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,961
- SHUT UP AND DO
MORE ART FOR ME.

495
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,030
- [sighs]

496
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,799
- THIS ONE'S RACIST.

497
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,637
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

498
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,041
I'VE LOOKED AT THIS
FOR FIVE HOURS NOW.

499
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,310
I LIKE THE GREEN ONE

500
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:19,979
AND THE RED CIRCLE RIGHT HERE.
