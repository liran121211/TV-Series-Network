1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:02,770
- THANK YOU, OLD GUS,

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:05,773
FOR BRIGHTENING OUR LIVES,
OUR HEARTS

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,541
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY
OUR SHOES.

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,677
[applause]

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,081
- THIS TRULY IS A DAY
OF MIXED EMOTIONS FOR ME.

6
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:15,216
I'M SAD THAT OLD GUS
IS LEAVING.

7
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:18,086
BUT IT ALLOWS ME TO HELP ANDY
RESTART HIS LIFE

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,554
AS PIONEER HALL'S
NEW SHOESHINE GUY.

9
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:23,224
- WELL, I'VE BEEN LISTENING
TO YOUR BORING SPEECHES

10
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:25,226
FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS.

11
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:29,063
AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO LISTEN TO ONE OF MINE.

12
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:30,231
YOU KNOW A DAY LIKE THIS

13
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,166
MAKES A MAN REFLECT
UPON HIS LIFE.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,634
AND I'VE COME
TO THE CONCLUSION

15
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:37,838
THAT I'VE COMPLETELY
WASTED MINE.

16
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,840
AND JUST FOR THE RECORD,

17
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,144
I NEVER EVER LIKED BEING CALLED
OLD GUS.

18
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,413
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT
WHEN I WAS IN MY 20S

19
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:46,847
AND I SURE HATE IT NOW.

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,450
SO GO TO HELL,
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU.

21
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,586
SCREW PAWNEE AND SCREW
YOUR DAMN SHOES.

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,755
AH!

23
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:58,559
- OLD GUS IS CLASSIC.

24
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,629
[upbeat music]

25
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:06,667
*

26
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,549
- SO I PROPOSE THAT WE
CHANGE OUR NAME

27
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,684
FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE
FOR PIT BEAUTIFICATION

28
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:27,421
TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE
FOR LOT BEAUTIFICATION.

29
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,623
APRIL, STOP THAT.
WHO ARE YOU TEXTING?

30
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:30,658
- YOU.

31
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:36,297
- AWW.
SHE'S TEXTING ME.

32
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,267
I'M SORRY YOU'RE BORED.

33
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,668
- UH, HEY, EVERYONE.

34
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:41,635
OH, HEY, ANN.

35
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:43,671
UM, LESLIE, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

36
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,739
- FINE. TOM YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

37
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,875
KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING.
KEEP THESE MINDS WORKING.

38
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,210
- ABSOLUTELY, CHIEF.

39
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,712
- OKAY, WOULD YOU RATHER
BE ABLE TO FLY

40
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,347
OR SPEAK FLUENT FRENCH?

41
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:55,149
DONNA, GO.
- FRENCH.

42
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:56,650
- I DON'T WANNA FREAK YOU OUT,

43
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,586
BUT ANOTHER DEPARTMENT
FILED A PLANNING CLAIM

44
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,454
FOR LOT 48.

45
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,790
- WHO?

46
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,392
NO...

47
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:06,560
- YEAH.
- DAMN IT!

48
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,629
THE LIBRARY?

49
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,499
PAWNEE'S LIBRARY DEPARTMENT
IS THE MOST DIABOLICAL,

50
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,567
RUTHLESS BUNCH OF BUREAUCRATS
I'VE EVER SEEN.

51
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,636
THEY'RE LIKE A BIKER GANG.

52
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,805
BUT INSTEAD OF SHOTGUNS
AND CRYSTAL METH

53
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,641
THEY USE POLITICAL SAVVY.

54
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,710
AND SHUSHING.

55
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:26,247
- IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
IT'S NOT A DONE DEAL.

56
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,548
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

57
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,283
THANKS FOR PULLING ME
OUT OF THERE.

58
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:30,651
I NEED A GOOD PLAN, THOUGH.

59
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,553
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
WANT TO CAUSE A PANIC.

60
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:33,954
NEWS FLASH, WE'RE SCREWED.

61
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,723
WE GOT A BIG PROBLEM
WITH THE LIBRARY.

62
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,525
- PUNK ASS BOOK JOCKEYS.

63
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,727
- WAIT, WHY DO WE HATE
THE LIBRARY?

64
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,361
- THE LIBRARY IS THE WORST
GROUP OF PEOPLE

65
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,895
EVER ASSEMBLED IN HISTORY.

66
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,897
THEY'RE MEAN,
CONNIVING, RUDE

67
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,367
AND EXTREMELY WELL READ,
WHICH MAKES THEM VERY DANGEROUS.

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,969
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO STEAL
LOT 48 FOR A NEW BRANCH.

69
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,604
all: WHAT?
- YEAH.

70
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:51,672
- GET OUT OF HERE.
- YEAH.

71
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,673
- ON 48?
- YEAH!

72
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,641
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

73
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,842
- I ACTUALLY THINK A LIBRARY
WOULD BE NICE

74
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,310
THAT CLOSE TO MY HOUSE.

75
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,348
BUT I'M NOT ABOUT TO SAY THAT
IN THERE.

76
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:01,682
- A NEW BRANCH?
- YES!

77
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,718
- OH, I HATE THEM.

78
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:07,588
- OKAY, WE NEED TO MAKE CONTACT
WITH SOMEONE THERE.

79
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:09,657
DOES ANYBODY KNOW ANYBODY
THAT WORKS AT THE LIBRARY?

80
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,360
- UH, WELL, WE ACTUALLY
KIND OF DO.

81
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,695
THE NEW DEPUTY DIRECTOR
OF THE DEPARTMENT

82
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,597
IS TAMMY SWANSON.

83
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,699
- RON'S EX-WIFE?

84
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,568
THAT'S TERRIFIC.
OR IS THAT AWFUL?

85
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,404
I MEAN, HE HATES HER,
BUT HE KNOWS HER.

86
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,606
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
OR IS IT JUST THE SAME?

87
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,608
- LESLIE, YOU'RE THINKING
OUT LOUD AGAIN.

88
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,577
- AM I?
I AM.

89
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,845
- OF COURSE, THAT BITCH
OF AN EX-WIFE

90
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,714
IS WORKING FOR
THE LIBRARY NOW.

91
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,249
THAT IS PERFECT.

92
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:36,684
THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD

93
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,487
WORKING AT THE WORST PLACE
IN THE WORLD.

94
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,255
- I HAVE TO GO TALK TO HER.

95
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:42,456
AND YOU GOTTA GIVE ME
SOMETHING I CAN USE.

96
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,724
DOES SHE HAVE ANY WEAKNESSES?

97
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,326
- NO.

98
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,395
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO?
EVERYBODY HAS A WEAKNESS.

99
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:48,329
-NOT MACHINES.

100
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,698
I HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT SHE WAS PROGRAMMED

101
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,799
BY SOMEONE FROM THE FUTURE

102
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,734
TO COME BACK AND DESTROY
ALL HAPPINESS.

103
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:54,868
- I SEE.

104
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,571
JUST, I KNEW THAT YOU HAD
TWO EX-WIVES NAMED TAMMY.

105
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,273
SO I WAS HOPING THAT
THERE WAS ONE

106
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:00,408
THAT YOU GOT ALONG WITH.

107
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,643
- NO.
I HATE 'EM BOTH.

108
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:03,777
ON MY DEATH BED,

109
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:07,581
MY FINAL WISH IS TO HAVE
MY EX-WIVES RUSHED TO MY SIDE

110
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:09,350
SO I CAN USE MY DYING BREATH

111
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,653
TO TELL THEM BOTH TO GO TO HELL
ONE LAST TIME.

112
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,955
WOULD I GET MARRIED AGAIN?
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

113
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,058
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE,
WHAT'S THE POINT OF LIVING?

114
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,329
- I'M JUST LOOKING FORWARD
TO A THOUGHTFUL DEBATE

115
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,764
WITH TAMMY ABOUT
THE RELATIVE MERITS

116
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,833
OF PARKS VERSUS LIBRARIES.

117
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,601
AND IN CASE SOMETHING BAD
GOES DOWN,

118
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,903
I WORE MY SHARPEST RINGS.

119
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,705
THIS ONE WILL TEAR YOU UP.

120
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,744
HELLO.
HI.

121
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,946
I'M LESLIE KNOPE.
I CALLED A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

122
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,883
- YOU HAVE A LOT OF NERVE
SHOWING YOUR FACE HERE.

123
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,452
- EXCUSE ME?

124
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:48,021
- YOU HAVE OVERDUE BOOK FEES
TOTALING $3.00 MISSY.

125
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,757
- THAT IS SO TYPICAL.

126
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,959
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN YOU'D USE
A LOW-BLOW,

127
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,927
DIRTY POOL, B.S. MOVE
LIKE THAT.

128
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,629
THAT'S WHY EVERYBODY HATES
THE LIBRARY.

129
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,064
HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT,
HERE'S YOUR $3.00.

130
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,599
AND I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL.

131
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,868
- LESLIE, LESLIE, LESLIE,
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

132
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,035
MY GOSH.

133
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,837
I MEAN, YOU DID HAVE $3.00
WORTH OF FINES,

134
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,739
BUT I CLEARED THEM.

135
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:06,974
WE GOVERNMENT GALS

136
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,477
HAVE TO WATCH
EACH OTHER'S BACKS, RIGHT?

137
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,380
- I KNOW THIS IS A TRAP.
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW.

138
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,915
- OKAY.
DID YOU TALK TO RON?

139
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:19,787
UM, RON TENDS TO EXAGGERATE
WHEN IT COMES TO ME.

140
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,590
I SWEAR I DON'T HAVE
CLOVEN FEET.

141
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:26,059
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.

142
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,596
-SHINE, SHINE,
SHINE YOUR SHOES?

143
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,698
WHAT DO YOU SAY, SIR?
MA'AM, SHOESHINE?

144
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,900
I WON'T LOOK UP YOUR SKIRT.

145
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,136
- ANN, WHOA.
OH, MY GOSH--CRAZY!

146
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,871
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IT'S ME, IT'S ANDY.

147
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,541
- HI, ANDY.
- SO, ANN, HOW YOU BEEN?

148
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,575
- GOOD.

149
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,544
YEAH, LESLIE TOLD ME
YOU WERE WORKING HERE NOW.

150
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:44,645
- YEAH, JUST JOINING
THE RAT RACE.

151
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,780
CHASING THE CHEESE.
RACING THE RATS.

152
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,115
TRYING TO GET THE CHEESE.

153
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,617
ENOUGH TECHNICAL BUSINESS TALK.

154
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,718
YOU LOOK RAVISHING.

155
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,486
- NOT A LOT OF CUSTOMERS,
HUH?

156
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,787
- YEAH, BUSINESS
IS A LITTLE SLOW.

157
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:57,658
IT IS DEFINITELY DUE TO
THE ECONOMY.

158
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,662
UM, I'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT
OF PEOPLE SAY THAT A LOT

159
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,596
ABOUT A LOT OF STUFF.

160
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,700
WHOA, MARK!
YOU WANT THOSE SHOES SHINED?

161
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,836
I'LL GIVE YOU A DISCOUNT BECAUSE
YOU'RE A FRIEND OF ANN'S.

162
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,138
- WELL, I'M MORE THAN
A FRIEND OF ANN'S.

163
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,673
- OH, NOT FOR LONG.

164
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,508
- I'M SORRY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

165
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,710
AT LEAST HE FINALLY HAS
A REAL JOB.

166
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,779
WHEN WE WERE DATING
THE ONLY JOB HE HAD

167
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:19,980
WAS SENDING AUDITION TAPES

168
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,815
TO SURVIVOR
AND DEAL OR NO DEAL.

169
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,751
- HI, MY NAME IS ANDY DWYER,

170
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,754
AND I WOULD BE A PERFECT
CONTESTANT FOR DEAL OR NO DEAL.

171
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,525
- I WANT IT TO BE
A PERFECT PARK,

172
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,527
WITH A STATE-OF-THE-ART
SWING SET

173
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,028
AND BASKETBALL COURTS.

174
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,565
AND OFF TO THE SIDE
A LOVELY SITTING AREA

175
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,167
FOR KIDS WITH ASTHMA TO WATCH
OTHER KIDS PLAY.

176
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,135
WOW, IF I'D HAD A PARK
LIKE THAT

177
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,704
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP

178
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,705
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T
HAVE GONE THROUGH

179
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,207
SUCH A PROLONGED
MALL SLUT PHASE.

180
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,645
- WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S
THE GOAL, TAMMY.

181
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,146
- LISTEN, YOU GUYS
GOT THERE FIRST.

182
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,516
I'M GONNA WITHDRAW MY REQUEST
FOR THE LOT

183
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,685
AS A PROFESSIONAL COURTESY
TO YOU.

184
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:00,053
GOVERNMENT GALS, RIGHT?

185
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,557
- GOVERNMENT GALS.

186
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,693
- SO YOU TALKED TO TAMMY.

187
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,695
WHAT'S IT LIKE TO STARE
INTO THE EYE

188
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:08,929
OF SATAN'S BUTT HOLE?

189
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,564
- SHE'S CHANGED, RON.

190
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:11,632
SHE'S A DIFFERENT PERSON.

191
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,866
I JUST--I THINK
IT WOULD BE HEALTHY

192
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,702
FOR YOU TO GET A SENSE
OF CLOSURE.

193
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:15,869
LOOK AT MARK AND ME.

194
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,037
WE SLEPT TOGETHER.
WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

195
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,539
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS.

196
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,107
- YOU SLEPT WITH BRENDANAWICZ?

197
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,676
- NO!

198
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,044
- LOOK, TAMMY AND I
DON'T WORK.

199
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,713
WE ARE OIL AND WATER.

200
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:28,649
OR OIL AND TNT AND C-4
AND A DETONATOR

201
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,918
AND A BUTANE TORCH.

202
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,721
NOTHING GOOD WILL COME...

203
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,756
WAIT...

204
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,828
SHE'S HERE, ISN'T SHE?

205
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,735
- HI, RON.

206
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,706
- TAMMY.

207
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,808
- GOOD.
GOOD START.

208
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,711
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS,

209
00:07:57,745 --> 00:07:59,780
BUT I JUST REALLY
WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

210
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:05,252
COULDN'T WE GO HAVE
A CUP OF COFFEE?

211
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,920
- LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

212
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,690
- THANKS, RON.

213
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:10,924
IT MEANS A LOT.

214
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,826
YOU'RE A MIRACLE WORKER.

215
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,163
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU JUST DID?

216
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,230
- YES, DONNA.

217
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,933
I GOT TWO PEOPLE TO PUT ASIDE
YEARS OF HOSTILITY

218
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,202
AND OPEN A DOOR TO
THE POSSIBILITY OF FRIENDSHIP.

219
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,704
- YOU WERE NOT HERE WHEN
RON AND TAMMY GOT DIVORCED.

220
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,106
I WAS.
THOSE TWO ARE CRAZY.

221
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,041
- YEAH, AND YOU
JUST OPENED THE GATES.

222
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,777
TO CRAZY TOWN.

223
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,279
- FRANKLY, I THINK RON
WAS ACTING LIKE A BABY.

224
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,847
A LITTLE BIT.

225
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,583
I MEAN, WHAT IS HE AFRAID OF?

226
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,819
TAMMY'S JUST A WOMAN.
A NICE WOMAN.

227
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,954
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S NOT A MURDERER.

228
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:42,823
SHE'S NOT A DRAGON.

229
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,892
- IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO SEE YOU, RON.

230
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,028
- YOU'VE AGED HORRIBLY.

231
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:51,599
- YOU SON OF A BITCH.

232
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,100
- THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG.
- OH, MY GOD!

233
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,635
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

234
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,203
NOTHING'S CHANGED, HAS IT?

235
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,871
WHO SET THE BED ON FIRE?
- EXCUSE ME, FOLKS.

236
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00,173
- I DID, OKAY.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANNA HEAR?

237
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,175
[overlapping chatter]
- PLEASE.

238
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,644
PLEASE.

239
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,880
- WHEN YOU MEDDLE IN
SOMEONE'S PERSONAL LIFE

240
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:10,117
IT'S JUST SO REWARDING.

241
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,023
- OH, GOD!
YEAH!

242
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,259
OH GOD, YEAH!

243
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,694
OH, GOD!

244
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,963
OH, YES, BABY!
GUN IT!

245
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,898
USUAL PLACE?

246
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,967
[laughing]

247
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,975
[laughing]

248
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,280
- * HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL

249
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,050
* READS THE CARD OF A MAN

250
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,153
* A KNIGHT WITHOUT ARMOR
IN A SAVAGE LAND *

251
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,387
GOOD MORNING, JERRY.

252
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,057
THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL
SWEATER VEST.

253
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,224
APRIL!

254
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,260
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD USE $20.00.

255
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,928
AM I RIGHT?
- WHY?

256
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,230
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE A KID
AND KIDS ALWAYS NEED MONEY.

257
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,932
- I NEED MONEY.
- HA!

258
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,934
THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE MY FAVORITE, TOM.

259
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,235
- WHEN TIGER WOODS
FEELS INVINCIBLE

260
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,337
HE WEARS A RED SHIRT
AND BLACK PANTS.

261
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,039
- GOOD MORNING, DEPUTY.

262
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,208
- RON WEARS THE SAME THING
AFTER HE'S HAD SEX.

263
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,277
- I'M A SIMPLE MAN.

264
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,378
I LIKE PRETTY,
DARK-HAIRED WOMEN

265
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,813
AND BREAKFAST FOOD.

266
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,014
BUT THIS STOCK PHOTO

267
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,650
I BOUGHT AT A FRAMING STORE
ISN'T REAL.

268
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:18,752
TODAY I GOT THE REAL THING.

269
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:22,823
A NAKED TAMMY MADE ME
BREAKFAST THIS MORNING.

270
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,893
I SHOULD'VE TAKEN
A PICTURE OF IT.

271
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,127
- HEY, TOM.

272
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,361
- WHAT'S UP?

273
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:31,164
- MY GIRLFRIEND'S EX IS WORKING
100 FEET AWAY FROM MY DESK.

274
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:34,001
AND HE'S BEEN PRETTY CLEAR
ABOUT WANTING HER BACK.

275
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,903
WHAT DO I DO WITH THAT?

276
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,170
- HMM.
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.

277
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,239
- YOU SHOULD BREAK UP WITH HER
AND TELL HER TO GO OUT WITH ME.

278
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,674
- THAT'S GOOD.
CAN I ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION?

279
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,243
WHY DID I COME TO YOU
FOR ADVICE?

280
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,177
- YEAH, OKAY.

281
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,946
I THINK YOU SHOULD
PLAY THIS ONE COOL, MAN.

282
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,748
BE THE GROWN-UP.
TAKE THE HIGH ROAD.

283
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,883
- YEAH.
- ANN'S A CLASSY CHICK.

284
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,151
IF YOU GET DOWN IN THE MUD,

285
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,352
YOU'RE JUST GONNA LOSE
HER RESPECT.

286
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,954
- UH...

287
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,256
YOU'VE JUST MADE A SURPRISING
AMOUNT OF SENSE, TOM.

288
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,357
THANK YOU.

289
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,259
- I'VE NEVER TAKEN
THE HIGH ROAD.

290
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,094
BUT I TELL OTHER PEOPLE TO.

291
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:05,365
'CAUSE THEN THERE'S MORE ROOM
FOR ME ON THE LOW ROAD.

292
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,969
- SO HOW DID YOUR COFFEE
WITH TAMMY GO?

293
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,404
- LESLIE, I CAN'T
THANK YOU ENOUGH

294
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,340
FOR STICKING YOUR NOSE
WHERE IT DIDN'T BELONG.

295
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,407
- I KNEW IT.

296
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,176
SO WHAT DID YOU GUYS
TALK ABOUT?

297
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,912
OLD TIMES?
I LOVE TALKING ABOUT OLD TIMES.

298
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:20,113
NEW TIMES ARE GREAT TOO.

299
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,314
BUT THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT OLD TIMES.

300
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,250
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- WE DIDN'T TALK.

301
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,752
WE MADE LOVE.

302
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,787
- OH, MY, MMM...

303
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,256
GOOD.
OH, WELL, SPARE ME THE DETAILS.

304
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,024
I'M JUST HAPPY--
- IT WAS SO INTENSE.

305
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:34,161
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE MY FLESH
STOPPED AND HERS BEGAN.

306
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,763
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

307
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,297
- YEAH.

308
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,099
- OUR MARRIAGE WAS ALWAYS
A COMPLETE DISASTER,

309
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:43,436
BUT WE DID HAVE THAT,
THE TWO OF US.

310
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,205
IT'S LIKE DOING PEYOTE

311
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,274
AND SNEEZING SLOWLY
FOR SIX HOURS.

312
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,809
- THIS SEEMS
LIKE A PRIVATE MATTER.

313
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:49,877
BUT I'M JUST SO--

314
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,179
- THAT WOMAN REALLY KNOWS
HER WAY AROUND A PENIS.

315
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,147
- [sighing] OKAY.

316
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,216
WELL, I'M HAPPY
THAT IT WENT WELL

317
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,185
AND THAT YOU ENJOYED
YOUR COFFEE.

318
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,353
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE

319
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,055
SHOULD BE FRIENDS
WITH THEIR EXES.

320
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,225
I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW MANY
OF MY EXES' WEDDINGS

321
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,227
I'VE BEEN TO.

322
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,832
[cackling]

323
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:14,935
- THEY'RE READING
THEIR OLD DIVORCE PAPERS.

324
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,770
- THREE FISTFULS OF HAIR?

325
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:18,806
THAT'S NOT EVEN POSSIBLE.

326
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,342
- WELL, I'M TOO CLASSY
TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO, DONNA.

327
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,144
SO I WROTE IT
ON A POST IT.

328
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,883
- LESLIE.

329
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:33,353
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE REST OF THE DAY OFF.

330
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,824
I MEAN YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME
WORRYING ABOUT THIS PARK.

331
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:40,127
BUT REALLY, WHO CARES?

332
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,429
- I CARE.
I CARE A LOT.

333
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,264
IT'S KINDA MY THING.
REMEMBER?

334
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,133
- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY
WHAT DOES IT MATTER

335
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,202
IF THE LOT BECOMES A PARK
OR A MUSEUM

336
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:52,372
OR A MEGA CHURCH?

337
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,406
OR A LIBRARY.

338
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,542
- NOBODY SAID LIBRARY.

339
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:59,246
- RON, YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
TO TAMMY ABOUT THE LOT?

340
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,849
- NO.

341
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,251
I SWEAR ON A GRAVE.

342
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,286
- OH, MY GOD!
RON!

343
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,487
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

344
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,289
ARE YOU GIVING HER THE LOT?

345
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,491
- NOT GIVING.

346
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,526
WE HAVE DISCUSSED A TRADE.

347
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,928
- FOR WHAT?

348
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,229
- [muttering]

349
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,330
- EXCUSE ME.

350
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:20,000
- MORE SEX.

351
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,936
- OH, GOD!

352
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,238
TAMMY, CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU
FOR A SECOND?

353
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,007
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

354
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,108
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT RON.

355
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,011
YOU'RE JUST USING HIM TO GET
LOT 48 FOR YOUR LIBRARY.

356
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:34,347
- LESLIE, THAT'S CRAZY.
AND CORRECT.

357
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,949
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

358
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,886
- LES, THERE ARE TWO KINDS
OF WOMEN IN THIS WORLD.

359
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,188
THERE ARE WOMEN
WHO WORK HARD

360
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,323
AND STRESS OUT ABOUT DOING
THE RIGHT THING

361
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,258
AND THEN THERE ARE WOMEN
WHO ARE COOL.

362
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,261
YOU COULD EITHER BE
A CLEOPATRA

363
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,331
OR YOU COULD BE AN
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.

364
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,934
I'D RATHER BE CLEOPATRA.

365
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,568
- WHAT KIND OF LUNATIC WOULD
WANNA BE CLEOPATRA

366
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:58,338
OVER ELEANOR ROOSEVELT?

367
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,640
- HAVEN'T YOU EVER MESSED
WITH A MAN'S HEAD

368
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,111
JUST TO SEE WHAT YOU COULD
GET HIM TO DO FOR YOU?

369
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,879
WE DO IT ALL THE TIME
IN THE LIBRARY DEPARTMENT.

370
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,981
YOU SHOULD COME
JOIN US SOMETIME.

371
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,317
- I WOULD NEVER WORK
AT THE LIBRARY DEPARTMENT.

372
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,185
I'M GONNA TELL RON
WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

373
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,320
AND THIS LITTLE GAME THAT
YOU'RE PLAYING

374
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,321
IS GONNA BE OVER.

375
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,455
- OKIE DOKE.

376
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,224
- YEAH, YOU BETTER RUN.

377
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,226
WE'RE NO LONGER
GOVERNMENT GALS.

378
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,294
LOOK, WE NEED TO TALK.

379
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,130
RON, NO.

380
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,432
THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT
REPRIORITIZATION DOCUMENT?

381
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,234
- CALM DOWN.
I HAVEN'T SIGNED IT YET.

382
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,301
- YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO.

383
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,569
BECAUSE TAMMY WANTS YOU TO

384
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,271
AND YOU DO EVERYTHING
THAT SHE WANTS.

385
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,240
- SHE MADE SOME REALLY GOOD
POINTS ABOUT LIBRARIES.

386
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,142
- ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING
TO YOURSELF?

387
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,910
YOU'RE DEFENDING
THE LIBRARY NOW?

388
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,511
RON, THE LIBRARY.

389
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,281
OF ALL THE HORRIFYING,
MISERABLE THINGS IN THE WORLD.

390
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,050
- SOME PEOPLE LIKE LIBRARIES.

391
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,251
- I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
WHAT I'M HEARING.

392
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,585
SOME PEOPLE LIKE LIBRARIES.

393
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,620
RON, SHE'S IN YOUR HEAD.

394
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,923
YOU SAID THAT SHE WAS
A MANIPULATIVE MONSTER

395
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:50,991
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

396
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,126
- NO, NO.
TAMMY'S CHANGED.

397
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,496
- LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND TELL ME THAT SHE'S CHANGED.

398
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:00,367
LOOK ME IN THE EYE.

399
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,036
- I'M SO SCREWED NOW.

400
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,938
HER HOOKS ARE IN MY BRAIN.
- YEP.

401
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:08,641
SHE HAS ALL THE POWER
AND I HAVE NOTHING.

402
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,377
I'M SO LITTLE.

403
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,190
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST BREAK UP
WITH HER?

404
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,293
- I DON'T THINK I CAN.

405
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,995
WE WOULD JUST END UP NAKED.

406
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,597
AND I'D GIVE HER YOUR LOT
AND MY HOUSE

407
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,664
AND GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE.

408
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,201
I HAVE NO CONTROL
OVER MY ACTIONS.

409
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,735
IT'S LIKE SHE'S CRAWLED UP
INSIDE ME--

410
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,370
- OH, GOD, RON.

411
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,672
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
YOUR DISGUSTING SEX ANYMORE.

412
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,641
OKAY, NOW SACK UP.

413
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,412
YOU ARE RON FREAKIN' SWANSON!

414
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,180
- NOT AROUND HER I'M NOT.

415
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:50,083
IT TOOK YEARS OF INTENSE,
FOCUSED HATRED

416
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,351
TO GET OVER HER.

417
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,521
AND NOW I'VE UNDONE
ALL THAT GREAT WORK.

418
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,490
YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME
BREAK UP WITH HER.

419
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,726
- I DON'T THINK I SHOULD
GET INVOLVED IN THIS.

420
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,362
- OH, NOW YOU DON'T WANT TO
GET INVOLVED?

421
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:03,663
"IT'S JUST COFFEE, RON."

422
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,598
"SHE'S CHANGED, RON."

423
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,268
"I LET MARK NAIL ME
AND WE'RE STILL FRIENDS."

424
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,270
- OKAY, I NEVER--I WOULD NEVER
USE THOSE WORDS.

425
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,772
I NEVER SAID--POINT TAKEN.

426
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,376
LET'S GO DUMP YOUR EX.

427
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,678
- THANK YOU.

428
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,413
- SO WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BE IN THE ROOM

429
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,614
WHEN I TELL HER IT'S OVER

430
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,749
OR WOULD YOU RATHER
WAIT OUTSIDE?

431
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,184
- IN THE ROOM.

432
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,519
I DON'T WANT HER TO THINK
I'M A WIMP.

433
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:27,687
- HERE ARE THE GROUND RULES.
DON'T TALK TO HER.

434
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,622
DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT
WITH HER.

435
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,358
DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING
SHE SAYS.

436
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,093
JUST SIT THERE
LIKE A POTTED PLANT.

437
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,362
CAN YOU DO THAT?

438
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:36,563
COME ON.

439
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,566
- DO YOU HAVE ANY TOM--
- MARK!

440
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,035
- HEY.
- HEY! DONNA.

441
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:43,436
- SO HOW'S
THE SHOESHINE GAME?

442
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,604
- I'M ON A BREAK.

443
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:48,708
ONE OF THE MANY ADVANTAGES
OF OWNING YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

444
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,711
- YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT
YOUR SITUATION, RIGHT?

445
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,314
- YEAH.
LISTEN, DONNA.

446
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,615
- YES.
- QUICK QUESTION.

447
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,218
ANN IS TRYING TO DECIDE
BETWEEN MARK AND MYSELF.

448
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,219
- NO, SHE'S NOT, ACTUALLY.

449
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,553
- IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE,
WHO WOULD YOU CHOOSE?

450
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,655
RIGHT NOW, ON THE SPOT.
- I'M NOT SURE.

451
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:03,523
WHY DON'T YOU SPIN AROUND
FOR ME.

452
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,126
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
CAN WE TALK PRIVATELY?

453
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,061
- SURE.
- JUST OUT HERE.

454
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,766
- MMM, ANDY.

455
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,269
- SO, TAMMY, FOR THAT
AND MANY OTHER REASONS

456
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,671
RON HAS DECIDED TO END
THIS RELATIONSHIP.

457
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:24,544
- WAIT A MINUTE.

458
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:25,678
RON BROUGHT YOU HERE

459
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,215
TO BREAK UP WITH ME
FOR HIM?

460
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,717
- SHE VOLUNTEERED.

461
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,652
- LESLIE,

462
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,122
RON DOESN'T WANT TO BREAK UP
WITH ME.

463
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:41,228
WHAT RON WANTS TO DO
IS LEAVE HERE RIGHT NOW.

464
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:44,197
GO TO THE SLEAZIEST MOTEL
IN TOWN

465
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:48,601
AND WRAP HIMSELF AROUND ME
LIKE A COILED SNAKE.

466
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:49,636
- NO, HE DOESN'T.

467
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,104
- I'M PRETTY SURE HE DOES.

468
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,606
- [groaning]

469
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,276
- SEE? HE'S COMPLETELY
OVER YOU.

470
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:00,147
- LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THAT
THIS ANN SITUATION

471
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,448
IS AWKWARD.

472
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,484
BUT I LIKE YOU A LOT
AS A DUDE.

473
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,387
AND I JUST HOPE THAT THERE IS
SOME WAY THAT WE CAN BOTH BE

474
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,756
MATURE AND MAYBE BE FRIENDS.

475
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,824
- YEAH, I DOUBT IT.

476
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,427
I MEAN, I THINK
YOU'RE A COOL DUDE TOO.

477
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,363
I LIKE YOU AS WELL.

478
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,831
BUT I'M STILL
IN LOVE WITH ANN.

479
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:23,303
I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE
UPFRONT ABOUT THAT.

480
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,805
- IS PUNCHING ALLOWED
ON THE HIGH ROAD?

481
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,575
- I'M SORRY, LESLIE.

482
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,745
SHE WINS.
I CAN'T RESIST HER.

483
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,746
- BUT, RON,
YOU HAVE TO.

484
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,616
-STAY OUT OF THIS.
THIS IS OUR RELATIONSHIP.

485
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:37,617
HE'S MY MAN

486
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,852
AND WE HAVE SOMETHING TWISTED
AND BEAUTIFUL.

487
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,621
OH...

488
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,723
YOU WANT RON.

489
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:44,891
THAT'S WHAT THIS
IS ALL ABOUT.

490
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:48,461
- NO, THAT'S INSANE.

491
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,730
FINE, I HAD ONE DREAM,
BUT NO, NO.

492
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:53,466
- BABY, DON'T YOU SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

493
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,669
SHE'S MANIPULATING YOU
BECAUSE SHE'S JEALOUS OF ME

494
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:59,906
AND THE THINGS I GET TO DO
TO YOUR BODY AND FACE.

495
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,742
- I'M HERE BECAUSE
RON IS MY FRIEND.

496
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,777
AND I DON'T LIKE SEEING
MY FRIENDS MISERABLE.

497
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,679
AND YOU, TAMMY,
YOU MAKE HIM MISERABLE.

498
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,781
SO, RON, YOU CAN GIVE HER
THE LOT OR DON'T.

499
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:09,616
WHATEVER.

500
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,653
JUST PLEASE, FIND A WAY
TO BE HAPPY.

501
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,559
- NO, WAIT.

502
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,594
- RON, IT'S OKAY.
JUST SIGN THE THING.

503
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,563
- NO, LESLIE.
IT'S NOT OKAY.

504
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,465
YOU JUST PUT MY NEEDS
IN FRONT OF YOUR OWN.

505
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,467
NO WOMAN HAS EVER DONE THAT
FOR ME BEFORE.

506
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,568
- I'M SURE THAT'S NOT TRUE.

507
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,803
- YOU SEE THE KIND OF WOMEN
THAT I CHOOSE, RIGHT?

508
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,872
LOOK, JUST WAIT FOR ME
DOWNSTAIRS.

509
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,641
IF I'M NOT DOWN
IN FIVE MINUTES,

510
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,909
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I'M RECEIVING
A PLEASURE SO INTENSE--

511
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,945
- OH, MY GOD!

512
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,217
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

513
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,719
ANDY AND ANN'S
FAMILY SHOESHINE?

514
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,421
- I THOUGHT IT HAD
A NICE RING TO IT.

515
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:49,422
- OH, MY GOD.

516
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,690
LOOK, MARK HAS BEEN REALLY COOL
ABOUT ALL THIS.

517
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,592
AND YOU'RE THROWING IT
IN HIS FACE.

518
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,461
- BUT I STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOU.

519
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:55,695
OKAY.
I SAID IT.

520
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,963
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

521
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,332
NOT MENTION THOSE FEELINGS
TO YOUR BOYFRIEND?

522
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,633
- YES!
- YES.

523
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,801
AND YOU MIGHT WANNA TAKE
THESE PICTURES DOWN.

524
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,771
- OH, MY GOD.
TAKE THOSE PICTURES DOWN.

525
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:05,772
- WHAT?
IT'S FINE.

526
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,474
WHAT DID I--
- ALL OF IT!

527
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:08,908
- I'M GONNA.
- NOW!

528
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,543
OH, MY GOD.

529
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,345
GIVE ME THE BIKINI ONE.

530
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,581
- THE TEENY ONE?
- BIKINI ONE.

531
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:23,990
- YOU DIDN'T
GIVE HER THE LOT.

532
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,292
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

533
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,793
- IS PART OF YOUR MOUSTACHE
MISSING?

534
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:27,927
- YES.
JUST KEEP WALKING.

535
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,362
- THERE'S A PUSH PIN
IN YOUR FACE.

536
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,663
- LEAVE IT IN.

537
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:31,498
CAN'T YOU WALK FASTER?

538
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,232
- MY LEGS ARE SHORTER
THAN YOURS.

539
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,808
- WE HAD A GOOD RUN.

540
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,448
- THANK YOU FOR SAVING
MY FUTURE PARK.

541
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,550
I KNOW THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
HARD FOR YOU.

542
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,486
YOU DIDN'T KILL TAMMY,
DID YOU?

543
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,923
- I'M AFRAID
SHE CAN'T BE KILLED.

544
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,858
TO EXES.

545
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,628
MAY THEY ALWAYS STAY
THAT WAY.

546
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:06,499
TAMMY IS A MEAN PERSON.

547
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:09,001
- COME ON, RON.
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.

548
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,404
- SHE'S A GRADE-A BITCH.

549
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,005
- THERE WE GO.

550
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,775
- EVERY TIME SHE LAUGHS
AN ANGEL DIES.

551
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,010
EVEN TELEMARKETERS
AVOID HER.

552
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:21,348
HER BIRTH WAS PAYBACK
FOR THE SINS OF MAN.

553
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:24,317
BUT YOU KNOW
THE WORST THING ABOUT HER?

554
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:26,085
- SHE WORKS FOR THE LIBRARY.

555
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,655
- SHE WORKS FOR THE LIBRARY.
