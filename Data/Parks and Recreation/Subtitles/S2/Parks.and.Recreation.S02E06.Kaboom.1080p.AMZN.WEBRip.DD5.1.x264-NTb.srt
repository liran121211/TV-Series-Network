00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,294

00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:28,829

00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:36,804

16
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:39,207
IT WAS A MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE,
BUT I FORGOT TO RETURN THEM.

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,741
- MAN-PILLOW,
THE PILLOW SHAPED LIKE A MAN.

18
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,276
- OH, GOD.

19
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,777
- ALSO SOMETHING
CALLED BUCKET OF CAKE.

20
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,513
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

21
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,814
I THINK SOMEONE DEFINITELY STOLE
MY CREDIT CARDS

22
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,449
SO WHY DON'T
YOU JUST CANCEL IT?

23
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,318

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,431
IT'S FOR MY LOWER BACK.

32
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,400
[triumphant music]

33
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:14,375
*

34
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:24,852
[applause]

00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,695
AWESOME!
IT IS PLAYGROUND TIME!

00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:37,598
all: YAY!
[applause]

40
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,500
- WELL, WE'RE HERE IN EAGLETOWN,
IT'S TWO TOWNS OVER.

41
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,535
AND WE'RE ALL
VOLUNTEERING FOR KABOOM!

42
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:45,373
A SERVICE ORGANIZATION THAT SAYS
IT BUILDS A PLAYGROUND IN A DAY.

43
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,441
- HIGH FIVE,
HIGH FIVE.

44
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,210
- I NEVER TRUST ANYTHING
THAT COMES THAT QUICKLY.

45
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,711
THAT'S WHY
I DON'T EAT MINUTE RICE.

46
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:54,548
SO THIS WHOLE BUILD-A-
PLAYGROUND-IN-A-DAY THING,

47
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:55,849
I MEAN THAT'S
JUST A SLOGAN, RIGHT?

48
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,352
- NOPE, ONE DAY, 24 HOURS.

49
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:00,154
- KEITH, THAT IS SO INCREDIBLE.
- KEITH!

50
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:01,655
- I MEAN, I WORK IN PARKS,

51
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,491
AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO GET SOMETHING DONE.

52
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,626
- NOT IF YOU
HAVE THE KABOOM! SPIRIT.

53
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,328
YOU CAN LOOK AT A PROBLEM AND
YOU CAN EITHER GO

54
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,662
"UH, THIS IS A PROBLEM",

55
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,431
OR YOU CAN KABOOM!

56
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,167
BLOW IT UP AND
TURN IT INTO SOMETHING GREAT.

57
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,669
YOU LITERALLY
"KABOOM!" THE PROBLEM.

58
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:17,605
[claps twice]
COME ON, PEOPLE!

59
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,840
I SEE MORE
GROUND THAN PLAYGROUND.

60
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,575
[high pitch] KABOOM!
- DON'T DO THAT.

61
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,844
both: ONE, TWO, THREE.

62
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,480
- OOH!
- MAN, THIS IS TOUGH.

63
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:27,881
- YEAH, BUT JUST
THINK OF ALL THE KIDS

64
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,617
THAT WILL
SWING ON THIS SWING.

65
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,253
FAT KIDS, SKINNY KIDS,
BRAINIACS, SLUTS,

66
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,589
THE GAY DRAMA KIDS, GOTHS,
JOCKS, THE ALTERNATIVE CROWD.

67
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,925
- MM-HMM.
- HEY, LESLIE.

68
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,461
HI.

69
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,962

70
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,564
- OH, I'M VOLUNTEERING.

71
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,799
I LOVE TO VOLUNTEER.

72
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,967
THE KEY TO VOLUNTEERING?

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,836
A LOT OF POCKETS.

74
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,504
FOR PUTTING ALL THE FOOD IN.

75
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:52,573
THE RED CROSS
HAS AMAZING COOKIES.

76
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,508
I GO THERE ALL THE TIME.

77
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,244
MEALS ON WHEELS
WAS A BONANZA.

78
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:59,680
SUICIDE HOTLINE,
SURPRISINGLY LAME SPREAD.

79
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,755
THOUGHT I'D GIVE BACK TO THOSE
LESS FORTUNATE THAN MYSELF.

80
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,624
- YOU LIVE IN A PIT.
- NOT ANYMORE.

81
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,360
LIVING WITH
THE DRUMMER OF MY BAND.

82
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,262
LIVING INDOORS.
PRETTY COOL.

83
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,630
NOT TO BRAG.
KINDA HARD NOT TO.

84
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,499
ANYHOW, GOTTA GO.

85
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,433
ME AND AN OLD ASIAN LADY

86
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:21,602
ARE DOUBLE-TEAMING
SOME MONKEY BARS, SO.

87
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,407
- HEY, LOOK, I GOT A REMOTE
CONTROL AND I'M CONTROLLING YOU.

88
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,975
GO FASTER!
GO FASTER!

89
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,910
* GO FASTER,
RON'S THE MASTER *

90
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:34,882
- AH! WELL...

91
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,451
YOU HAVE BEEN
OFFICIALLY KABOOMED.

92
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:39,987
- WHOA, LOOK AT YOU TWO
AND YOUR BIG KABOOM!

93
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,623
GREAT JOB!
I GOT GIFTS.

94
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,258
- OH!

95
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,493
- THANKS.
- AND ONE MORE FOR YOU.

96
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,295
- THANK YOU.

97
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,829
- SO YOU GUYS GONNA
JOIN US TOMORROW IN MUNCIE?

98
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,865
- NO, I WISH,
BUT BACK TO THE REAL WORLD.

99
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,001
- AT LEAST YOU GUYS WILL BE
KABOOMING SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?

100
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,504
REMEMBER...
TAKE A MAN KABOOMING,

101
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,971
HE KABOOMS FOR A DAY.

102
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,040
BUT YOU TEACH A MAN
HOW TO KABOOM...

103
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,644
KABOOM! KABOOM!
KABOOM!

104
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,579
- UH, I'M SO PUMPED!

105
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,681
GOD, I COULD
TAKE ON THE WORLD.

106
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,351
- I COULD PREP, LIKE,
1,000 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS.

107
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,619
- [laughing]
- IN AN HOUR!

108
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,887
- THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

109
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,057
- THERE IT IS--THE PIT.
- MM.

110
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,992
- THERE'S SOMETHING
I WISH I COULD KABOOM!

111
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,728
- WELL, WE ARE.

112
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,364
IT'S JUST A SLOW BOOM.

113
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,699
A SLOWER,
MORE DELIBERATE KABOOM!

114
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:26,834
- YEAH, TOTALLY.

115
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,669
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
- OKAY.

116
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,004
[car door closes]

117
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,576
[sighs]

118
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,645
[exhales]

119
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,480
YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MESS IS?

120
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,615
THIS IS A LIST OF THINGS
WE HAVE TO COMPLETE

121
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,984
BEFORE WE FILL IN
THE PIT BEHIND ANN'S HOUSE.

122
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,619
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

123
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,955
THIS IS A KABOOMER.

124
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,630
JERRY, DID YOU USE
PERMANENT MARKER AGAIN ?

125
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:57,831
- I'M SORRY, GUYS.

126
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,834
[everyone grumbles
over each other]

127
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,603
- OKAY, FORGET IT.

128
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,838
LET'S ALL
PRETEND JERRY WASN'T BORN.

129
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,674
AND THIS IS CLEAN.

130
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,643
HOW DO WE
SPEED UP THE PROCESS?

131
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:12,446
HOW DO WE KABOOM! IT?

132
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,782
RULES, CODES,
PERMITS, RED TAPE--

133
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,018
I NEVER REALIZED HOW FRUSTRATING
IT IS TO BE IN THE GOVERNMENT.

134
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,954
IN MY NEXT LIFE,
I'M GOING INTO PRIVATE INDUSTRY.

135
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,657
MAYBE STRIP MINING.

136
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,126
OKAY, EVERYBODY TAKE OUT
THEIR THINKING CAPS.

137
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,695
AND RIP THEM UP.

138
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,431
THEN TAKE OUT
YOUR DOING CAPS,

139
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,899
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA
DO SOMETHING TODAY.

140
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,567
- I HAVE A COUPLE
DOING CAPS IN MY WALLET.

141
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:34,802
THAT'S WHAT I CALL CONDOMS.

142
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,704
- COME ON, TOM.
FOCUS, PLEASE.

143
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,105
HOW DO WE CUT
THROUGH THE RED TAPE?

144
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,940
AND HOW DO WE GET
THIS PIT FILLED IN? IDEAS?

145
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,376
- WE NEED TO CUT THROUGH THE RED
TAPE AND GET THE PIT FILLED IN.

146
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,577
- YES, TOM.
GOOD.

147
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,614
OKAY, EVERYBODY ELSE NEEDS
TO PARTICIPATE. COME ON, GUYS.

148
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,716
THESE SUGGESTIONS
AREN'T GONNA SUGGEST THEMSELVES.

149
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,551
YES, JERRY?

150
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,686
THIS IDEA BETTER BE GOOD.

151
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,723
ANN?

152
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:56,957
- I SUPPORT YOU.
- GOOD.

153
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,526
- YOU COULD PETITION
TO EXPEDITE

154
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,461
THE ARCHITECTURAL
REVIEW BOARD PROCESS.

155
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:03,731
- MARK, BUDDY...
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.

156
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,400
I WANT TO KABOOM! IT.
OKAY?

157
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:08,035
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
OUTSIDE REALLY QUICK?

158
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,737
- SURE.

159
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,472
MARK'S GONNA HELP ME,
SO THANKS FOR NOTHING, JERRY.

160
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,508
GOOD JOB, ANN.

161
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,809
- SO YOU REALLY WANNA
GET THIS PIT FILLED IN, RIGHT?

162
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:16,877
- YES.

163
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,512
- AND WE'LL DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES?

164
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,714
- MARK, I AM SO SICK
OF MOVING LIKE A SLUG.

165
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,616
I WANNA MOVE LIKE A CHEETAH.

166
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,886
OR A SLUG DRIVING
A REMOTE CONTROLLED CAR.

167
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,888
SOMETHING MORE PLAUSIBLE
THAN THAT, BUT FAST.

168
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,089
- WOULD YOU BREAK THE RULES?

169
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,958
- I WON'T MURDER.

170
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,627
- THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

171
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,529
BUT IT'S
ACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE.

172
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:38,532
IF YOU WANNA FILL IN THE PIT,
JUST GO FILL IT IN.

173
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,569
DON'T ASK FOR PERMISSION,
ASK FOR FORGIVENESS.

174
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:44,638
- OH, I LIKE THAT.
OKAY, WOW.

175
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,574
SO WHO GIVES ME THE GO AHEAD

176
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,041
TO NOT ASK
FOR PERMISSION, BECAUSE--

177
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,543
- NO, NO, NO.
- IS IT RON?

178
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:50,744
- NO, IT'S NOBODY.
IT'S NOBODY.

179
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,681
IT'S YOU.
YOU HAVE TO BE BOLD.

180
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,983
- OKAY?
- OKAY, LOOK...

181
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,985
YOU WANNA
GET THE PIT FILLED IN?

182
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:01,655
THEN GO RENT A BULLDOZER
AND FILL IN THE FREAKING PIT.

183
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,226
- HEY.

184
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,228
- WHAT'S UP?

185
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,598
- SAY YOU HAD A FRIEND
WHO WANTED TO DO SOMETHING GOOD,

186
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,966
BUT A LITTLE RISKY, AND SHE
WAS KIND OF NERVOUS ABOUT IT.

187
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,036
AND THIS FRIEND IS ME.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

188
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,905
- MM, YOU SHOULD DO IT.

189
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,040
AND YOU SHOULD ASK
YOUR FRIEND TO HELP YOU

190
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,075
BECAUSE YOUR FRIEND
TOTALLY HAS YOUR BACK.

191
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,077
AND THAT FRIEND IS ME.
- YOU'LL HELP ME?

192
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,580
- OF COURSE, I'LL DO
ANYTHING I CAN TO HELP.

193
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,048
LET'S DO IT!

194
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,583
[laughing]

195
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:30,651
- OKAY.

196
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,085
- WHAT ARE WE DOING?
IS IT DANGEROUS?

197
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,121
- WE'RE NOT GOING
TO MURDER ANYONE.

198
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,627
- IT WAS CRAZY.
I DIDN'T GET A SINGLE PERMIT.

199
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,530
NOBODY STAMPED ANYTHING,
ALL I DID WAS ORDER A BACKHOE,

200
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,064
AND IT CAME WITH
A GUY WHO RUNS IT.

201
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,868
I'VE NEVER
RENTED A GUY BEFORE.

202
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,604
WISH I KNEW
ABOUT THAT DURING PROM.

203
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,806
- THERE WAS A GIRL AT MY PROM
WHO WAS KNOWN AS THE BACKHOE.

204
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,509
MARY DUNBAR, SHE'D
LET ANYONE MASSAGE HER BACK.

205
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:56,744
- I'M SO EXCITED
WE'RE DOING THIS!

206
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,646
AND WE'RE DOING IT
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

207
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,080
WE'RE GIVING OURSELVES
PERMISSION.

208
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,114
- [laughing]
- LOOK!

209
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,016
I HAD THESE HARD HATS MADE.

210
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,218
CHECK IT OUT..."KICK ASS".

211
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:06,687
- I'LL TAKE THAT ONE.
- OKAY.

212
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,089
OH, MY GOD!
ANN, THIS IS SO COOL!

213
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,758
DO YOU FEEL GIDDY?
- YEAH.

214
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,959
- I'M SO PROUD OF US.

215
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,695
- MS. MONTEGUE, YOU READY?

216
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,865
- I DIDN'T WANNA TELL HIM
MY REAL NAME, YOU KNOW?

217
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,299
[heavy accent]
YEAH.

218
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,503
FIRST SPEECH, EASY--
IMPORTANT MOMENT HERE.

219
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,641
WE ARE ABOUT
TO FILL THIS HOLE NOW.

220
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:32,279
NOT WITH DIRT, BUT WITH
THE COURAGE OF A THOUSAND LIONS.

221
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,982
AND THE SOLEMN MEMORY
OF ALL OF OUR FRIENDS

222
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,951
WHO HAVE FALLEN IN
THIS CURSED HOLE.

223
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,988
DUMP IT!

224
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,727
[both applause]
YAY!

225
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:52,332
- AH, WHAT THE [bleep]?

226
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,701
- ANDY?

227
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:57,671
- I'M OKAY.
- AH!

228
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:00,708
- OH, GOD.
- OH, MY GOD.

229
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,611
[heart monitor ringing]

230
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,648
- WELL, THAT BEEPING
WAS SURE ANNOYING,

231
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,982
BUT THIS IS
EVEN MORE ANNOYING.

232
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,350
- I'LL HANDLE THIS.

233
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,120
- THE MONITOR
IS NOT A TOY, ANDY.

234
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,288
- ANYTHING IS A TOY
IF YOU PLAY WITH IT.

235
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,691
- CHALK THAT UP
TO YOUR CONCUSSION.

236
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:21,194
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS
IS YOUR CAT SCAN'S CLEAR.

237
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,663
- COOL.

238
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,665
- ANDY, I'M REALLY HAPPY
YOU'RE OKAY.

239
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:25,833
LESLIE WAS WORRIED TOO.

240
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:29,202
WE SHOULD'VE CHECKED BEFORE
TO SEE IF YOU WERE...HOME.

241
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,038
- OH, NO, I TOLD YOU,
I MOVED OUT OF THE PIT.

242
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,040
I JUST HAD TO GO BACK
'CAUSE I FORGOT MY HEADPHONES.

243
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,842
AND I LAYED DOWN ON
THIS REALLY COMFY TARP

244
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,844
I SAW AN OLD CEREAL BOX
I HADN'T READ BEFORE,

245
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,046
SO I MUST'VE DRIFTED OFF.

246
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,214
NEXT THING YOU KNOW...
[explosive noise]

247
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,817
SWISHHHHH.
DIRT.

248
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:47,254
- SCOOT UP FOR ONE SEC.

249
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,690
AND BACK DOWN.

250
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,391
THERE YOU GO.
- [sigh]

251
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,360
THAT IS PERFECT.

252
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,663
IT'S LIKE
I'M LYING ON A CLOUD.

253
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,297
THIS IS AWESOME.

254
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,801
ANN AND ANDY,
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

255
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:06,106
THE PIT WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

256
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,410
- I'M SORRY ABOUT ANDY, BUT
I'M NOT SORRY ABOUT WHAT I DID.

257
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,646
WHAT'S MY CRIME?

258
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,748
I GOT BOLD?

259
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,651
AND A LITTLE NEGLIGENT?
- KNOPE!

260
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,720
MY OFFICE, NOW!

261
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,388
- HEY.

262
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,856
CAN I SMOKE IN HERE?

263
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,157
- YOU DON'T SMOKE.

264
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,358
- JUST ASKING IF I CAN.

265
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,027
- ARE YOU HIGH?

266
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,262
- I'M HIGH ON KABOOM!

267
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,199
DON'T ASK FOR PERMISSION,
ASK FOR FORGIVENESS.

268
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,802
- THAT'S RIGHT, YOU NEVER DID
ASK ME FOR PERMISSION, DID YOU?

269
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,404
WELL, I'M SORRY
TO BURST YOUR KA-BUBBLE,

270
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:41,408
BUT I JUST HAD MY ASS KA-HANDED
TO ME BY THE CITY MANAGER,

271
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,011
AND NOW THIS ENTIRE
DEPARTMENT IS KA-SCREWED.

272
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,181
- RON,
I'M SO, SO, SO SORRY.

273
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:51,351
- WHAT THE KA-[bleep]
WERE YOU THINKING?

274
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,454
I WOULD PREFER THAT
SHE ASK ME FOR MY PERMISSION

275
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,058
SO I CAN SAY NO.
I LIKE SAYING NO.

276
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,761
IT LOWERS THEIR ENTHUSIASM.

277
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,398
- SO I BROUGHT YOU
SOME CLEAN CLOTHES

278
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,700
THAT I FOUND AT MY HOUSE.

279
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,335
- OH, MY GOD, MY SEXY SWEATER!

280
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,770
IT HAS A HOLE
CUT OUT OVER THE BICEP.

281
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,404
THANK YOU.
- NO PROBLEM.

282
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:15,042
- NO, A-CAKES, SERIOUSLY.

283
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,777
THANK YOU.

284
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,045
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

285
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,749
- NO.
THANK YOU.

286
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:22,883
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

287
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,987
WHAT DO YOU--WHAT DO YOU
THINK IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

288
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,490
- A TRAGIC ACCIDENT
REIGNITED FEELINGS

289
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,127
YOU THOUGHT WERE LONG DEAD AND
WE ARE FINALLY BACK TOGETHER.

290
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,764
- ANDY...
WE'RE NOT BACK TOGETHER.

291
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,900
YOU KNOW THAT
I'M KIND OF WITH MARK NOW.

292
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,969
- OH, GOD,
IS THAT STILL HAPPENING?

293
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,737
I DON'T GET IT.

294
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:45,739
WHAT DOES HE HAVE
THAT I DON'T HAVE?

295
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:46,439
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

296
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:49,009
- YEAH.
- EVERYTHING.

297
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,411
HE HAS LITERALLY EVERYTHING
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE:

298
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:56,349
A JOB, A CAR,
A STEADY INCOME, AN ADDRESS,

299
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,786
A SECOND PAIR OF SHOES,
TABLE MANNERS,

300
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:02,489
THE ABILITY TO SAY
"TAMPON" WITHOUT GIGGLING.

301
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:06,794
MARK HAS HIS LIFE TOGETHER.

302
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,263
I'LL GET YOU
A DIFFERENT NURSE.

303
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,936
- IT'S AWFUL
WHAT HAPPENED TO ANDY.

304
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,470
BUT SOMETIMES
WHEN YOU MAKE AN OMELET,

305
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,072
YOU GOTTA BREAK A FEW EGGS.

306
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,508
WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE,
NO OMELETS AT ALL?

307
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,543
WHO WANTS TO LIVE IN
THAT KIND OF WORLD?

308
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,012
MAYBE BIRDS.

309
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,980
THEN ALL THEIR BABIES
WOULD LIVE.

310
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,349
- MS. KNOPE?
LISTEN.

311
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:32,986
HI, SCOTT BRADDOCK,
CITY ATTORNEY.

312
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,354
- HEY, SCOTT.

313
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,156
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
YOU WERE FRIENDS WITH ANDY.

314
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,390
- I NEVER MET HIM.

315
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,860
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT HE COULD
SUE US AT THE DROP OF A HAT.

316
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:43,063
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW HE IS THE MOST
DANGEROUS MAN IN PAWNEE.

317
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,497
- IS THAT ALL
YOU LAWYERS THINK ABOUT?

318
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:48,035
LAWSUITS, AND LAWS,
AND LEGALESE?

319
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,303
- YES.
- WELL, YOU CAN RELAX.

320
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:53,073
ALL I'M GONNA DO
IS GO IN AND JUST SAY,

321
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,475
"WE'RE SO SORRY,
IT'S ENTIRELY OUR FAULT"--

322
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,410
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
YOU CAN'T SAY ANY OF THAT.

323
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,411
IT ADMITS LIABILITY.

324
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,048
YOU CAN'T SAY "I'M SORRY",
OR "I APOLOGIZE."

325
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,182
IT IMPLIES GUILT.

326
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,584
- THAT'S INSANE.
I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

327
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,820
ANDY WAS THE VICTIM--
- CAN'T SAY "VICTIM".

328
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,189
- OF AN EXTREMELY UNFORTUNATE--
- CAN'T SAY "UNFORTUNATE",

329
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,423
AND YOU CAN'T SAY "SITUATION".

330
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,825
- I CAN'T SAY
THE WORD "SITUATION"?

331
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,861
- NO, IT IMPLIES
THERE WAS A SITUATION.

332
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,129
- CAN I GIVE HIM THE PIG?

333
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,565
- YEAH, PIG'S FINE.

334
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,167
- HI, ANDY.

335
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,201
- HI, LESLIE.

336
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,502
- GOT THIS FOR YOU.
- AW.

337
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,937
- HOPE YOU SQUEAL BETTER.
- AH.

338
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:26,406
[pig snorts]
[laughing]

339
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:31,344
[laughing]
- [clears throat]

340
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,580
- THIS IS MY FRIEND, SCOTT.

341
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:34,848
- HI, SCOTT.

342
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,383
- MM-HMM.

343
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,052
- ANDY, I JUST WANTED TO SAY,
I AM SO, SO, SO--

344
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,587
- MM-MM-MM-MM-MM.

345
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,623
- FILLED WITH EMOTIONS.

346
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,092
AS ANY PERSON WOULD.

347
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,527
[mouthing] I'M SORRY.
I'M SO, SO SORRY.

348
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,162
- WHAT?

349
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,164
- NO MIMING.
- UH...

350
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,001
UH, YOU WERE IN THE PIT.

351
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,402
- WE'RE NOT
CONCEDING THAT POINT.

352
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,570
- YOU WERE IN A PLACE...

353
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,307
WE'RE BOTH HERE NOW.

354
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,975
THE GOVERNMENT--
- NO, NO!

355
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,210
NO.

356
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,611
UH, WE GOTTA GO.
- WHAT?

357
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:05,612
- LET'S GO.
- WHY?

358
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:06,914
- COME ON.
- WENDELL ADAMS.

359
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,115
I'M ANDREW'S ATTORNEY.

360
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,183
- ANDY, NO!

361
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,252
- IT'S MY ONLY OPTION--
- ANDY, STOP.

362
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:15,255
I'VE ADVISED MY CLIENT
NOT TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

363
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,257
HE'S SUING
THE CITY OF PAWNEE.

364
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,359
- ANDY, YOU'RE
SUING YOUR HOME TOWN?

365
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,061
- ANDY, NO.

366
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:25,232
- CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT THIS?
- LESLIE, NO.

367
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,333
- THIS IS TERRIBLE.

368
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,434
- DON'T SAY "TERRIBLE".

369
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,069
DON'T LOOK BACK.

370
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,570
[pig snorting]

371
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,977
[phone ringing]
- HELLO!

372
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,012
- ANDY, IT'S LESLIE.

373
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,047
- HELLO?

374
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,915
- HELLO.
ANDY, IT'S LESLIE.

375
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,017
- PSYCH!
LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE BEEP.

376
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,986
[beeps]
- ANDY, IT'S LESLIE.

377
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,556
LOOK, WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN
YOU SAID IT'S YOUR ONLY OPTION?

378
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,158
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK.

379
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,960
WITHOUT LAWYERS PRESENT.

380
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:56,964
IF YOU WANNA MEET, JUST PUT
A WHITE CHALK 'X' ON THE MAILBOX

381
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,631
ACROSS THE STREET
FROM CITY HALL.

382
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,934
OR CALL ME BACK--
JUST CALL ME BACK.

383
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,269
[beeps]

384
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,104
ANDY, WHY AREN'T YOU
RETURNING MY CALLS?

385
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,606
IS IT BECAUSE OF YOUR LAWYER?
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR LAWYER.

386
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,576
[beeps]
HEY, ANDY, IT'S YOUR AUNT.

387
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:13,113
YOUR MOM OR DAD'S SISTER.

388
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:18,151
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU
THIS, BUT YOUR UNCLE HAS PASSED.

389
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,687
HE'S WITH JESUS NOW.

390
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,726
SO WE'RE HAVING A MEMORIAL
IN 30 MINUTES AT CITY HALL.

391
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,727
[beeps]

392
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,696
HEY, FREE GUITARS AT CITY HALL!
EVERYBODY RUN!

393
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,098
[beeps]

394
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,966
[robot voice]
BECAUSE OF A LOCAL DISASTER,

395
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,006
YOU, ANDY DWYER, MUST
GO TO THE EVACUATION CENTER

396
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,144
AT PAWNEE CITY HALL...
[sighs]

397
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,646
- HM, THAT WAS WEIRD.

398
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,082
- [gasps]
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?

399
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,686
- [sighs] I PROMISE THAT ANDY
ISN'T SUING JUST FOR THE MONEY.

400
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,555
- LESLIE,
THE MAN LIVED IN A PIT.

401
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,125
OKAY, HE COULDN'T FIND A PLACE
TO LIVE ON THE EARTH'S SURFACE,

402
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,726
SO HE WENT UNDER THE GROUND.

403
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,395
YOU'RE DEALING WITH A GROWN MAN
WHO THINKS LIKE A GOFER.

404
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,065
- I FEEL LIKE IF
I COULD GET PAST THE LAWYERS,

405
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,533
AND FIND OUT
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON,

406
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,601
I THINK I COULD GET HIM
TO DROP THE LAWSUIT.

407
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,310
- [Andy on phone]
ANN, IS THAT YOU?

408
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,979
- HEY. WE NEED TO TALK
SOMEWHERE PRIVATE.

409
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:22,682
[knocking]
- OH!

410
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,684
- BABY, I'M BACK.

411
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,453
- THANK YOU SO--
WHAH! AH!

412
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,655
- WHY ARE YOU NAKED?
- OH!

413
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,023
- WELL,
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID,

414
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:31,224
WE'RE GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

415
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,792
- NO, WE'RE NOT.
- YES, WE ARE.

416
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,195
YOU SHOULD'VE HEARD THE SUPER
SEXY STUFF SHE WAS SAYING TO ME.

417
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,764
- I SAID "HEY, ANDY, IT'S ANN,
CAN WE TALK AT MY HOUSE?"

418
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,466
- THAT'S NOT HOW YOU SAID IT,

419
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,770
YOU WERE LIKE, "HEY, ANDY, IT'S
ANN, CAN YOU TALK AT MY HOUSE?"

420
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,038
- MY GOD, YOU'RE SUCH A BABY.

421
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,306
UGH, LITERALLY.

422
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,776
BIG NAKED BABY,
PUT CLOTHES ON.

423
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,479
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SHOULD'VE SEEN THIS COMING.

424
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,746
- HAS HE
SHOWED UP NAKED BEFORE?

425
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,550
- OH, YEAH--ANNIVERSARIES,
BIRTHDAYS, HOLIDAYS.

426
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,786
GOOD LUCK.
- WHERE ARE YOU--

427
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,455
HEY, ANN--JUST--
- NONE OF YOUR CLOTHES FIT ME,

428
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,392
SO I'M PUTTING AN APRON
OVER THE FRONT STUFF.

429
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,493
IS SHE GONE?

430
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,131
- WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN YOU
SAID THIS WAS YOUR ONLY OPTION?

431
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,799
- WELL,
I'M COMPLETELY BROKE.

432
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:16,569
AND MY LAWYER SAID IT COULD BE
WORTH UPWARDS OF $100,000.

433
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,838
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE SUING JUST FOR THE MONEY.

434
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,840
- I WANT ANN BACK,
AND SHE SAID SHE REALLY NEEDS

435
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,075
A GUY WITH A LOT OF MONEY.

436
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,710
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ANN.

437
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:24,811
- WELL, I CAN'T
REALLY DO HER VOICE.

438
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,080
BUT SHE SAID SHE LIKES MARK
BECAUSE HE'S A GROWN-UP

439
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:28,215
WITH A BANK ACCOUNT.

440
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,182
I PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER,

441
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,818
$100,000, I CAN
PROBABLY GET A BANK ACCOUNT.

442
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,820
- SOMETIMES I THINK
THE RIGHT THING TO DO

443
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,388
IS TO NOT TAKE SHORTCUTS.

444
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,390
I MEAN, LOOK, I TRIED
TO FILL IN THE PIT.

445
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,758
THAT DIDN'T WORK EITHER.

446
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,228
- FINE.

447
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:43,696
I'LL GET A JOB.

448
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,498
ANN WILL RESPECT THAT.

449
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:49,169
I CAN MAKE SIX BUCKS A DAY
PLAYING GUITAR IN THE STREET.

450
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,637
I CAN'T MAKE SIX BUCKS A DAY.

451
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,174
- WAIT A SECOND, I KNOW I JUST
SAID THAT SHORTCUTS ARE BAD,

452
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:58,178
BUT I KIND OF JUST THOUGHT
OF AN AWESOME SHORTCUT.

453
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,414
- MR. DWYER, WE'RE VERY HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE DROPPING THE SUIT.

454
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:02,782
- YEAH,
IT'S REALLY TERRIFIC.

455
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,717
- I HAVE MY CONDITIONS.
- NO.

456
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,220
NEVER, I WILL NOT NEGOTIATE
WITH GREEDY STREET PEOPLE.

457
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,356
- WAIT, LESLIE,
LET'S HEAR HIM OUT.

458
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:14,294
- WE PLANNED THIS.
- CHUK-CHUK...KABOOM!

459
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,729
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE?

460
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:21,868
- ONE, I WANT
THAT PIT FILLED IN, SIR.

461
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,641
- IS THERE A TWO?

462
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,744
- A GUARANTEED STARTING SPOT

463
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:37,284
ON THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS--
INSIDE LINEBACKER.

464
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,752
- WE CAN'T ACCOMPLISH THAT.

465
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,756
- I THINK THAT ANDY
SEEMS LIKE HE DOESN'T

466
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,892
CARE SO MUCH
ABOUT THE SECOND ONE.

467
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:50,730
AND HE WOULD BE FINE
WITH US JUST FILLING IN THE PIT.

468
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,399
WHAT DO YOU SAY, SCOTT?

469
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,567
- YEAH.

470
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,469
EVENTUALLY, WE'RE
GONNA FILL IN THE PIT.

471
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:59,239
- EVENTUALLY?

472
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,508
I'VE ALREADY BEEN
INJURED IN THAT THING TWICE.

473
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,744
AND I CAN FALL IN TEN
MORE TIMES BY "EVENTUALLY".

474
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,479
EVERY TIME
I WALK PAST THAT PIT,

475
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,248
I'M FORCED TO RELIVE
THE MOST TRAUMATIC

476
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:11,618
TWO SEPARATE DAYS OF MY LIFE
AND WANNA SUE YOU AGAIN.

477
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:18,291
- WELL, I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT IT REALLY SEEMS LIKE

478
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,761
ANDY HAS US
OVER A BARREL HERE, SCOTT.

479
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,263
- YEAH.

480
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,832
- THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING.

481
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,734
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

482
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:28,868
- [laughing]
- OW!

483
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,470
- OH, SORRY.

484
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,772
USUALLY IN THESE SITUATIONS
A PERSON SAYS "PINCH ME."

485
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,744
- IS THAT ANDY?

486
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,347
- HUH, YEAH.

487
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,882
JUST ONE OF HIS CONDITIONS
FOR THE SETTLEMENT, I GUESS.

488
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,418
- HE SETTLED?

489
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:49,522
- YEP, GAVE UP
$100,000 PROBABLY.

490
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:50,957
JUST FOR ONE THING.

491
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,227
THE CITY FILL IN THE PIT
BEHIND YOUR HOUSE.

492
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,895
- WHY?

493
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,497
- WHO KNOWS?

494
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,400
WHO KNOWS WHY THAT GOPHER
DOES WHAT HE DOES?

495
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,569
- YOU ALWAYS
HATED THIS PIT!

496
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,743
- GOOD-BYE, PIT...
HELLO, LOT.

497
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:13,746
HOW DOES TAKING RISKS
MAKE ME FEEL?

498
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,549
AMAZING.

499
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,719
TINGLING SENSATION
THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE BODY.

500
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,821
I FEEL FLUSHED.

501
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,924
MY MUSCLES FEEL RELAXED,
YET I FEEL AWAKE.

502
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,494
JUST WAVES OF PLEASURE.

503
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,030
I WISH THERE
WAS SOMETHING PHYSICAL

504
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,765
THAT CAN MAKE ME
FEEL THIS WAY.

505
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,969
- WOW, YOU DID IT.

506
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:39,306
- YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

507
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,907
- THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO DO.
- MY GOD, WE'RE SO CLOSE!

508
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,576
- YEAH.
- I'M GONNA CALL KABOOM!

509
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,745
AND CHECK ON THEIR
AVAILABILITY FOR NEXT YEAR.

510
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,947
- GREAT.
- [clears throat]

511
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,449
- [on phone]
INFORMATION.

512
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,451
- HI, YES, I'D LIKE
THE NUMBER FOR KABOOM!

513
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,586
THE NATIONAL PLAYGROUND
BUILDING CHARITY.

514
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,588
I HOPE THEY CAN WORK US IN.

515
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,624
- [woman on phone] I'M SORRY,
THERE'S NO LISTING.

516
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,926
- WHAT?
ARE YOU SURE?

517
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,595
- KABOOM! IS A WORD
I MADE UP.

518
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:03,863
IT'S NOT IN ANY DICTIONARY.

519
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,598
I TRICK PEOPLE
INTO BUILDING PLAYGROUNDS

520
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,534
IN EMPTY LOTS
IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.

521
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,469
IT'S AN ELABORATE PRANK.

522
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:11,704
FOR MY NEXT PRANK,
I'M GOING TO BUILD A HOSPITAL

523
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,740
IN A POOR PART OF CHINA.

524
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,642
THEY'LL NEVER SEE IT COMING!

525
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:18,678
