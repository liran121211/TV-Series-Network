STEADILY MOVING UP MY THIGH *

* SHE HAD OPENED UP THE BUTTONS
ON HER SHIRT SO FAR *

NOTICE THAT POLICE CAR *

NO MATTER TIME NOR PLACE *

REASON WHY I'M DOWN HERE...

SO THE POINT IS, DO YOU
THINK THAT MARRYING PENGUINS

132
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,724
MADE SOME KIND OF STATEMENT?

133
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,561
- YES, THE STATEMENT WAS
THAT YOU'RE VERY LONELY,

134
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,728
AND YOU NEED A PET.

135
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:55,896

BUT HE'S STRAIGHT FOR ME,
BUT HE'S GAY FOR BEN,

151

AND I HATE BEN.

153
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,960
- IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED.
- NO.

154
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,896

FOR YOU GUYS?

157

BECAUSE YOU'RE KINDA LIKE
THEIR HERO NOW.

160
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,076
OH, PLEASE,
IT WAS JUST PENGUINS.

161
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,845
- NO.
- I'M A PUBLIC SERVANT,

162
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,747
AND I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO TAKE A POLITICAL STANCE.

163
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,716
- BUT YOU DID,
AND IT WAS AWESOME.

164
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,018
- YEAH, NONE OF THE OTHER
POLITICIANS EVER TAKE A STAND,

165
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,086
AND IT MEANS A LOT
TO THE WHOLE GAY COMMUNITY.

166
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,788
- OH, WELL...

167

00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,566
- YEAH, YOU HAVE TO COME.

173
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,134
- WHO--WHO MADE THIS?

174
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,869
all: WE DID.
- HOW?

175
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:09,903
- PHOTOSHOP.
- WHAT?

176
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,639
- COMPUTERS.
- OH.

177
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,443
- HEY.

178
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,677
WHY ARE YOU ALL DOLLED UP?

179
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,978
- OH, IT'S A LONG STORY.

180
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,481
I'M THE GUEST OF HONOR
AT THIS GAY BAR TONIGHT.

181
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:23,116
I GUESS GAY MEN
ARE STARTING TO LIKE ME.

182
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,620
I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS THEY THINK
I'M FABULOUS OR SOMETHING.

183
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:27,855
- WELL, YOU LOOK GOOD, GIRL.

184
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,723
YOU GONNA
TURN SOMEBODY TONIGHT.

185
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:34,628
- [laughing]

186
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,664
THAT WAS, HANDS DOWN,
THE BEST INTERACTION

187
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,031
I'VE EVER HAD WITH DONNA.

188
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:42,002
- LESLIE,
THIS IS MARCIA LANGMAN

189
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:45,639
FROM THE SOCIETY FOR
FAMILY STABILITY FOUNDATION.

190
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,708
- OH, HELLO.
I LOVE YOUR TOP.

191
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,709
- OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

192
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,078
I WAS JUST HOPING YOU
HAD A MOMENT TO DISCUSS

193
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,813
THE EVENTS
AT THE ZOO YESTERDAY.

194
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,915
- WELL, I HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS, SO...

195
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,750
- WELL,
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU

196
00:06:56,784 --> 00:07:01,088
AND THOSE FINE PEOPLE
AT THE SFSF?

197
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,856
- WELL, UM...

198
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,191
YOU COULD RESIGN.
[laughing]

199
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,493
IF YOU'RE UP FOR IT.

200
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:07,828
- OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS?

201
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,499
- WHEN YOU PERFORMED
A MARRIAGE FOR GAY PENGUINS

202
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:14,802
USING TAXPAYER MONEY
ON GOVERNMENT PROPERTY,

203
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,837
YOU WERE SYMBOLICALLY
TAKING A STAND

204
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,172
IN FAVOR OF
THE GAY MARRIAGE AGENDA.

205
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,975
- OH, I'M SORRY,
BUT HOLD ON A SECOND THERE.

206
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,978
MARCIA, THAT WAS
NOT MY INTENTION AT ALL.

207
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,515
- WELL, WHY ELSE
WOULD YOU MARRY PENGUINS?

208
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,818
- BECAUSE I FIRMLY BELIEVED
THAT IT WOULD BE CUTE.

209
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:31,719
AND IT WAS.

210
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,120
- LESLIE, ARE YOU MARRIED?

211
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,221
- NO.

212
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,757
UM, NOT YET, MARCIA.

213
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,925
SOON.
PROBABLY.

214
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,728
I HAVE A PLAN, BUT NOT--
NO, NOT NOW.

215
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,696
NOT DATING ANYONE YET.

216
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,831
FOCUSING ON MY CAREER,
BUT...

217
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,499
- I THOUGHT SO.

218
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,768
SO YOU COULDN'T
POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND.

219
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:52,640
BUT WHEN GAYS MARRY, IT RUINS
MARRIAGE FOR THE REST OF US.

220
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,175
SO EITHER
YOU ANNUL THE WEDDING

221
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,811
OR I'LL PUBLICLY
ASK FOR YOUR RESIGNATION.

222
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,815
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SO TERRIBLE WITH DIRECTIONS.

223
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,150
IF I'M HEADING
TO THE PARKING LOT,

224
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,552
DO I MAKE
A LEFT OUT OF HERE,

225
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:05,719
OR DO I GO RIGHT?
- IT'S A LEFT, YEAH.

226
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,154
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

227
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,221
- ANNUL THE WEDDING!

228
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:13,727
- [exhales slowly]

229
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,529
- HEY.
- HI.

230
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,230
- I'M SUPPOSED
TO MEET LESLIE FOR LUNCH,

231
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:21,101
BUT SHE ACTUALLY WORKS, SO...
- OUCH.

232
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,703
- MARK WAS BROUGHT
TO MY HOSPITAL

233
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,171
THE NIGHT OF THE ACCIDENT.

234
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,739
HE WAS HERE FOR A WEEK.

235
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:27,941
I THINK WHEN
HIS HEAD HIT THE GROUND

236
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,643
IT MUST'VE
KNOCKED SOMETHING LOOSE,

237
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,713
BECAUSE HE'S ACTUALLY
A PRETTY NICE GUY NOW.

238
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,783
AND ANDY,
AFTER WE BROKE UP,

239
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,051
HE TOLD ME
HE WAS GOING TO KANSAS

240
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,953
TO CLIMB MOUNTAINS.

241
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,725
SO, I DON'T--I DON'T
REALLY KNOW WHERE HE IS.

242
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,294
- HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN
THAT DOCUMENTARY ABOUT FOOD YET?

243
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,196
- NO, I HAVEN'T.
BUT I HEARD IT'S REALLY GOOD.

244
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,631
I WANT TO SEE IT.

245
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,033
- WE SHOULD GO TOGETHER.

246
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,068
- WHAT?
OH, YEAH--NO.

247
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,804
I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK SO.

248
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,972
THAT--THAT WOULD BE
LIKE A--A DATE.

249
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,140
- OH, OKAY.

250
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,642
SAY NO MORE.

251
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,976
- MMM.

252
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,812
I HATE SALAD.

253
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:08,616
- LESLIE, I DON'T WANT
TO EVER KEEP SECRETS FROM YOU.

254
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:09,817
- OH, ME NEITHER.

255
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,719
LOOK, LET'S INVENT
OUR OWN SECRET LANGUAGE

256
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:12,552
THAT ONLY WE UNDERSTAND,

257
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:13,587
AND THEN WE CAN
USE IT AROUND PEOPLE

258
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:15,188
AND NO ONE WILL KNOW
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

259
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,290
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

260
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:20,661
- BUT IN THE MEANTIME, I'M
JUST GONNA TELL YOU IN ENGLISH,

261
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:24,131
UH, MARK KIND OF
ASKED ME OUT.

262
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,334
HE WEIRDLY ASKED ME
TO GO SEE A MOVIE WITH HIM.

263
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,902
AND I SAID NO, OF COURSE.

264
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:32,072
BUT I JUST--I JUST
WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW.

265
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,010
- I'M FEELING A LOT OF
CONFUSING THINGS RIGHT NOW.

266
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,346
- YEAH--
NO, OF COURSE YOU ARE.

267
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,150
AND YOUR FRIENDSHIP IS
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME.

268
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,786
AND HE'S OFF-LIMITS.

269
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,323
- THANK YOU, MAN.

270
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,192
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW I WAS REALLY SERIOUS

271
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,827
ABOUT THAT SECRET LANGUAGE.
- I KNOW.

272
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:56,830
[loud club music]

273
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,999
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS A GAY BAR.

274
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,001
- YEAH, ESPECIALLY
WITH THAT HETEROSEXUAL COWBOY

275
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,336
GREETING US ON THE WAY IN.
- WHERE SHOULD I DRINK NOW?

276
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,739
- THERE'S A BAR ON EIGHTH STREET
CALLED PITCHERS AND CATCHERS.

277
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,207
YOU CAN GO THERE.
- YEAH. HEY!

278
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,742
HEY, LISTEN,
HERE'S THE PLAN.

279
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,077
OUR POSITION IS
WE HAVE NO POSITION.

280

SO LET'S JUST SAY
THANK YOU FOR THE PARTY,

281
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,683

ABOUT LIVING IN THIS PIT?

511
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,131
IT'S PROBABLY KEEPING
MY SUIT PRESSED.

512
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,870
AND THE RATS.

513
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,907
IT'S LIKE A FREAKIN'
RAT PARADE EVERY NIGHT.

514
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,809
I JUST WANT TO BE
CLOSE TO HER HOUSE

515
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,911
BECAUSE I NEED
TO PROTECT HER.

516
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:08,248
'CAUSE THERE ARE SOME WEIRD
PEOPLE THAT LIVE AROUND HERE.

517
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,517
- [on phone] YEAH, IF
YOU LET PENGUINS GET MARRIED,

518
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,784
WHERE DOES IT END?

519
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,853
I MEAN, WOULD YOU LET
ME MARRY MY GUINEA PIG?

520
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,389
BECAUSE I REALLY DO
WANT TO MARRY MY GUINEA PIG.

521
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:17,890
I'LL TAKE MY ANSWER
OFF THE AIR.

522
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,091
- I THINK
THAT'S A VALUABLE POINT.

523
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,561
- YOU KNOW, ATTENDANCE IS
UP 30% AT THE ZOO, BY THE WAY.

524
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,263
YOU'RE WELCOME!

525
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,897
AND THAT PENGUIN WEDDING
WAS CUTE, DAMN IT.

526
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,266
AND I'M NOT
GOING TO ANNUL IT.

527
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,800
- I'D ASK YOU TO RECONSIDER.

528
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,570
- WELL, I'D ASK
YOU TO STOP ASKING ME.

529
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,240
BECAUSE IT'S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN, MARCIA.

530
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,874
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- LAST TIME I CHECKED,

531
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,310
I DON'T THINK
I--I--I MURDERED ANYONE,

532
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,213
OR HAD AN AFFAIR,
OR DID DRUGS!

533
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:41,881
BUT I APOLOGIZE.

534
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,816
I APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING FUN

535
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,252
AND FOR MAKING SOMETHING CUTE.

536
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,622
- WHERE ARE YOU FROM
ORIGINALLY?

537
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,658
- OH, NO!
WHAT DID I DO?

538
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,761
- SO YOU WILL
NOT BE ANNULLING--

539
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,729
- NO,
I WILL NOT BE ANNULLING.

540
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,331
NO.

541
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,670
LOOK AT THEM.

542
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,307
THEY'RE JUST IN THEIR OWN
LITTLE...PENGUIN LOVE BUBBLE.

543
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,278
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT IT'S
LIKE WHEN YOU MEET YOUR MATE

544
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,879
AND KNOW YOU'RE
GONNA BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

545
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:16,816
[doorbell ringing]

546
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,685
- HI.
- HI.

547
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,952
YOU KNOW WHAT I REALIZED?
- WHAT?

548
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,388
- WE'RE JUST ANIMALS.

549
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,989
WE DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT LOVE.

550
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,624
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

551
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,259
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO
ON THAT DATE WITH MARK.

552
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,827
- OH, LESLIE--

553
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,262
- REALLY, SERIOUSLY,
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

554
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,398
AND...LOOK, HE MIGHT NOT
BE MY GAY PENGUIN,

555
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,865
BUT HE COULD BE YOURS.

556
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,001
- LOOK, I TOLD YOU, I'M NOT
GOING ON A DATE WITH HIM.

557
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,803
- OKAY, FINE.

558
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,004
IF YOU DON'T WANNA GO OUT WITH
HIM, DON'T GO OUT WITH HIM.

559
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,772
BUT DON'T NOT
DO IT BECAUSE OF ME.

560
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,441
'CAUSE I'M REALLY FINE
WITH IT.

561
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:44,043
ALL THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME
IS THAT WE'RE STILL FRIENDS.

562
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,679
- ME TOO.
- GOOD, GREAT.

563
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,149
PLUS, I ALREADY
CALLED AND TOLD HIM

564
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,385
THAT YOU WERE DYING TO GO OUT
WITH HIM, SO HAVE FUN.

565
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,421
- HUH?

566
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,791
- SO I TRANSFERRED
THE PENGUINS TO A ZOO IN IOWA.

567
00:20:58,825 --> 00:20:59,992
GAY MARRIAGE IS LEGAL THERE,

568
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,961
SO HOPEFULLY
THEY'LL BE HAPPY.

569
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,262
AT LEAST
THEY'LL BE TOGETHER.

570
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,769
OH, LOOK!
SIX FLAGS!

571
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,404
I SHOULD TAKE THEM
ON A WATER SLIDE.

572
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,906
THEY MIGHT DIE.
BUT IT WOULD BE SO CUTE!

573
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,943
