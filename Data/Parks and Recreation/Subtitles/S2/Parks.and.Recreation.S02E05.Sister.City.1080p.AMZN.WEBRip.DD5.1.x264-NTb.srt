1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,771
- TODAY WE ARE WELCOMING
A DELEGATION

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,074
FROM THE PARKS DEPARTMENT
OF OUR SISTER CITY,

3
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:08,509
BORAQUA, VENEZUELA.

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,445
OUR PHOTO-OP WITH THE MAYOR
IS TOMORROW AT 3:00 P.M.,

5
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:13,447
SO I'M GOING TO NEED
YOUR SUGGESTIONS

6
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,783
ABOUT MY WARDROBE ASAP.

7
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,318
- I TOLD YOU--
GOLD-SEQUINED SWEATPANTS.

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,787
- ALSO, REMEMBER, EVERYONE,

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,423
VENEZUELA IS A POOR COUNTRY.

10
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,225
THESE MEN ARE NOT USED

11
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:27,795
TO THE WEALTH AND FLASH THAT WE
HAVE HERE IN CENTRAL INDIANA.

12
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,798
OUR ONLY JOB
OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS

13
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:33,067
IS TO MAKE THESE MEN
FEEL AT HOME.

14
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,768
YES, I AM A LITTLE NERVOUS.

15
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:37,738
PAWNEE HAS KIND OF
A TRICKY HISTORY

16
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,742
WITH WELCOMING
FOREIGN VISITORS.

17
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,277
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

18
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:48,182
OUR GUESTS ARE GOING TO STAY
IN A MOTEL FOR SURE.

19
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:51,185
[triumphant music]

20
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:59,227
*

21
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,172
- OH, GOD, WHAT IF THEY
DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH?

22
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:12,340
APRIL,
YOU KNOW SPANISH, RIGHT?

23
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,480
- OH, GOOD.
EXCELLENT.

24
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:20,848
- MY MOM'S PUERTO RICAN.

25
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,452
THAT'S WHY I'M
SO LIVELY AND COLORFUL.

26
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,320
- OH, MY GOD.
HERE THEY ARE.

27
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:27,288
OKAY, EVERYBODY, CLEAN UP.

28
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:30,791
PULL YOUR THING UP.
EVERYONE JUST BE GOOD.

29
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,794
JERRY, HIT IT.

30
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,129
THIS IS MY BABY.

31
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:36,797
I PUT THIS WHOLE TRIP TOGETHER.

32
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,567
AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING--
IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY.

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,903
YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU FIT ALL
OF PAWNEE IN A 48-HOUR VISIT?

34
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,805
I HAD TO DROP

35
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:49,743
THE ROCK-AND-ROLL BOWLING ALLEY
FROM OUR ITINERARY.

36
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,712
THAT WAS ONE OF THE
MOST DIFFICULT PHONE CALLS

37
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:52,846
I'VE EVER HAD TO MAKE.

38
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,216
- HELLO, MOST EXCELLENT
REPRESENTATIVES

39
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,751
OF THE GREAT PARKS DEPARTMENT
OF BORAQUA, VENEZUELA.

40
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,554
I AM DEPUTY DIRECTOR
OF PARKS AND RECREATION

41
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,623
AND CHAIRWOMAN
OF THE DEPARTMENTAL AD HOC

42
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,726
SUBCOMMITTEE FOR PIT
BEAUTIFICATION, LESLIE KNOPE.

43
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,195
- IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

44
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,729
I AM VICE DIRECTOR
EJECUTIVO DEL DIPUTADO

45
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,431
DEL DEPARTAMENTO DE PARQUES,

46
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,534
RAUL ALEJANDRO BASTILLA PEDRO
DE VELOSO DE MALDONADO.

47
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,702
- I'M TOM.

48
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,270
- THESE ARE MY COLLEAGUES,

49
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:20,241
ANTONIO RIVERA-FONSECA,
MINISTER OF SMALL FOUNTAINS,

50
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:23,544
AND ELVIS CORREJA,
ADMINISTRATOR OF HEDGES.

51
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,313
- AND HE IS?

52
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,547
- PAY NO ATTENTION TO HIM.

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,849
HE'S OUR INTERN, JHONNY.
HE IS WORTHLESS.

54
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,285
WE ARE QUITE TIRED
FROM OUR TRIP.

55
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,753
COULD YOU HAVE YOUR SERVANT
COLLECT OUR BAGS, PLEASE?

56
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,955
- WHAT DID HE CALL ME?
- TOM, PLEASE.

57
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,324
IT'S A DIFFERENT CULTURE, OKAY?

58
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,658
JUST BE A GOOD HOST
AND DO THIS FOR ME.

59
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,592
- FINE.

60
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:41,462
- YES, WE WILL GET
OUR PATHETIC SERVANT BOY

61
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,664
TO FETCH YOUR LUGGAGE.
GO, BOY.

62
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,666
NOW, I KNOW YOU GENTLEMEN
HAD A LONG FLIGHT,

63
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:49,770
BUT I HAVE PREPARED
A WELCOME PARTY IN YOUR HONOR.

64
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,739
- EXCELLENT, I LIKE TO PARTY.

65
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,442
- WELL, MY JOB IS TO SEE
TO YOUR EVERY NEED.

66
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:57,745
- DO WE JUST, UM,
SELECT THE WOMAN WE DESIRE?

67
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,515
I WILL TAKE
THE LARGE BLACK ONE.

68
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,484
- INTERESTING CHOICE.
- WHAT?

69
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,618
- DO YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF A BOOK

70
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,654
WITH PHOTOS OF THE WOMEN
AVAILABLE TO US?

71
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:10,491
IF NOT, I WILL ALSO TAKE
THE SEXY BLACK ONE.

72
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,892
- I AM NOT SURPRISED AT ALL.

73
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,996
I'VE BEEN TO SOUTH AMERICA.
I DID VERY WELL THERE.

74
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,299
- I THINK THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A TRANSLATION PROBLEM.

75
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,700
WHEN I SAID PARTY,
I MEANT ONE

76
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,935
THAT DID NOT INCLUDE
SEX FOR PAY,

77
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,505
BUT ONE THAT HAD
FOOD AND DRINK AND DANCING.

78
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,506
THAT SORT OF THING.

79
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,608
- SO NO WOMEN?

80
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,310
- NO.

81
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:32,446
OFF TO KIND OF A WEIRD START.

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,682
OH, WE HAVE SO MUCH
TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER.

83
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,817
WHAT KIND OF BIRDS
DO YOU GUYS EAT?

84
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,818
- CHICKENS.

85
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,688
- US TOO.
AMAZING.

86
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,291
- WHAT IS THIS?

87
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,692
- WATER.

88
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,294
I'MSORRY--
AGUA.

89
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,695
IN OUR COUNTRY
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS

90
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,530
DRINK ONLY BOTTLED WATER.

91
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,631
- WELL, I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT THAT WATER'S

92
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,632
VERY SAFE TO DRINK.

93
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,834
- [snickers]
NO. BOTTLED.

94
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,803
PLEASE.
SEND THE BOY.

95
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,571
- TOM, GO GET WATER.

96
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,572
- LESLIE, COME ON.

97
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:02,343
- FOR YOUR TROUBLES.

98
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,845
- YOU GOT IT, CHIEF.

99
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,659
- HEY, APRIL,
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT A SECOND?

100
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,561
- GO AWAY, JERRY.

101
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,297
- OKAY.

102
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,069
[oohs and ahhs]

103
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,706
- THIS IS A GOLD-PLATED REPLICA
OF A GUN HUGO CHAVEZ USED

104
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,576
IN THE 1992
SOCIALIST REVOLUTION.

105
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:36,644
IT IS A GIFT.

106
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:41,615
- THIS GUN TRULY SYMBOLIZES
THE BLOSSOMING PEACE

107
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,818
BETWEEN OUR TWO NATIONS.

108
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,854
A KEY ASPECT TO DIPLOMACY
IS GIFT-GIVING.

109
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:50,324
THE GIFT HAS TO BE NICE ENOUGH
TO HONOR AND RESPECT THE GUEST,

110
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:52,693
BUT NOT SO NICE
THAT IT SHAMES HIM.

111
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,463
PLUS, IT NEEDS TO REPRESENT
THE LOCAL CULTURE.

112
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:56,997
AND I FOUND THE PERFECT THING.

113
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,735
A BOTTLE OF HIGH-FRUCTOSE
CORN SYRUP MADE RIGHT HERE

114
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,837
IN PAWNEE'S OWN
SWEETUMS FACTORY.

115
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,706
SWEETUMS: "IF YOU CAN'T
BEAT 'EM, SWEETUMS."

116
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,941
SINCE 1891.

117
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,878
AND THREE DOZEN
RUBBER BABY-BOTTLE NIPPLES.

118
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,713
ALSO MADE HERE IN PAWNEE.

119
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,882
KERNSTON'S RUBBER NIPPLES.

120
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,050
"TASTES LIKE THE REAL THING."

121
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,653
[applause]

122
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,492
- YES, AND WE TOO
ARE PLEASED TO BE HERE

123
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,494
IN YOUR DIRTY ALLEYWAY.

124
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,830
WE THANK YOU
FOR THE CONTAINER OF SAP

125
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,031
AND THE BAG OF GARBAGE.

126
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,967
- HIS ENGLISH ISN'T PERFECT,
SO I DON'T THINK HE REALIZES

127
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,703
HOW INSULTING HE'S BEING.

128
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,839
- WE ARE ALSO SISTER CITIES
WITH KAESONG, NORTH KOREA.

129
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,675
THEIR TOWN IS FAR NICER.

130
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:44,144
- THAT'S FINE. IT'S MY JOB.
I'M A DIPLOMAT.

131
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,079
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

132
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,781
- WE HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
FOR A VERY LONG TIME,

133
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,518
BUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS REALLY,
FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS,

134
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,553
TRULY DEPRESSING.

135
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,121
REALLY, REALLY SAD STUFF.

136
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,089
- I MEAN, THAT'S WHY PEOPLE
RESPECT HILLARY CLINTON SO MUCH,

137
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,592
'CAUSE NOBODY TAKES
A PUNCH LIKE HER.

138
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:02,596
SHE'S THE STRONGEST, SMARTEST
PUNCHING BAG IN THE WORLD.

139
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,964
- IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE
ANTONIO SAID TO ME,

140
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,866
"CAN WE TURN
THIS CAR AROUND

141
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,801
"AND SAY WE'RE SICK
OR SOMETHING,

142
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:08,669
OR THAT WE LOST OUR WAY?"

143
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,738
OF COURSE THAT
WOULD BE RUDE TO YOU.

144
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:11,739
[laughing]

145
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,143
- WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION?

146
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,411
- I'M A CITY PLANNER.

147
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:20,581
- THIS CITY WAS PLANNED?
- [laughs]

148
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,950
- ON THE DRIVE IN,
I SAW A TATTOO PARLOR

149
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,918
NEXT TO A SCHOOL
NEXT TO A TACO BELL.

150
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,988
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS DESIGNED
BY A VERY STUPID RODENT.

151
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,958
- HE'S ACTUALLY
A PRETTY SMART RODENT.

152
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,727
- AH.
YOU HAVE A QUICK WIT.

153
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,929
- [chuckles]
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

154
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:38,065
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.
I WILL HAVE YOU FOR THE EVENING.

155
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,034
- [gasps]
OH, BOY.

156
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,770
- SHE'LL GET BACK TO YOU
ON THAT.

157
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,939
- POLITICALLY, NO.
I DON'T SUPPORT CHAVEZ.

158
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:50,611
I DESPISE HIM
AND EVERYTHING THAT HE DOES.

159
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:54,047
ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS IS
A PRETTY SWEET-ASS GUN.

160
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,718
- THE BANANA
YOU WANTED, SEÃ‘OR.

161
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,719
- FINALLY.

162
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,521
YOU PEEL.

163
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:01,955
- WHAT?

164
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,123
- WITH YOUR HANDS,

165
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:07,495
YOU PEEL THE BANANA.

166
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,196
- OKAY, LET'S GET STARTED,
SHALL WE?

167
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,031
I HAVE A FULL DAY
OF ACTIVITIES PLANNED.

168
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,500
- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
WHERE THE CHILDREN

169
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,734
ARE FED THE SWEETENERS.

170
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,569
- OUR RESTAURANT?

171
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:17,004
- AMERICAN CHILDREN
ARE FATTENED MORE EFFICIENTLY

172
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,873
THAN ANY OTHER CHILDREN
IN THE WORLD.

173
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:22,976
THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE BASKETBALLS.
I MEAN, THEY'RE HUGE.

174
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,945
LITTLE PORKERS.

175
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,247
- OKAY, THIS IS
OUR THERMOMETER.

176
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,982
I'M TRYING TO TURN
A GIANT DIRT PIT

177
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,651
INTO A COMMUNITY PARK,

178
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:34,555
BUT I NEED $35,000,
AND THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE

179
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,056
ENOUGH MONEY IN ITS BUDGET.

180
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,224
- I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

181
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,959
- YOU'VE NEVER HAD
A BUDGET SHORTAGE?

182
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,729
[all laughing]

183
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,165
- [sighs]
NO.

184
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,235
- VENEZUELA IS BLESSED
WITH MASSIVE OIL RESERVES.

185
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,238
MASSIVE, I MEAN, TREMENDOUS,
LIKE YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE.

186
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,507
THE STATE SELLS THE OIL,

187
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:57,144
KEEPS ALL THE MONEY,
AND WE BUILD WHATEVER WE WANT.

188
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:02,115
- WOW, WELL, NOW
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

189
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,517
[laughs]

190
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,921
- I FEEL THAT MY ENGLISH
WAS VERY CLEAR.

191
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,089
SHALL I REPEAT?

192
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:12,660
VENEZUELA--
VENEZUELA, MY COUNTRY--

193
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,663
HAS A LOT OF OIL.
OIL IS FOOD FOR CARS.

194
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:19,900
- THE VENEZUELANS
ARE VERY CONFIDENT PEOPLE.

195
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,102
OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW THESE GUYS
DIDN'T TURN OUT

196
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,871
TO BE EXACTLY
HOW WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE.

197
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,906
- YOU SAID THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW
WHAT TOILET PAPER IS.

198
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,741
- I'M CALLING AN AUDIBLE.

199
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,276
WE CAN'T BE HUMBLE ANYMORE.

200
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,111
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS--
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THEM

201
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:34,147
TO OUR BEST PARK, AND WE'RE
GOING TO BLOW THEIR SOCKS OFF.

202
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,049
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK THAT'S
GOING TO BLOW THEIR SOCKS OFF.

203
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,818
- FINE, WE'LL GO FURTHER.

204
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,852
WE'LL TAKE THEM TO CHICAGO
AND PRETEND IT'S PART OF PAWNEE.

205
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:39,853
OR NEW YORK.

206
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,021
OR LONDON!

207
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,656
NO, WAIT,
THE MONEY'S DIFFERENT THERE.

208
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,957
THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
OKAY, NEVER MIND.

209
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,092
WE'LL GO TO THE PARK.

210
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,994
EVERYBODY DOING
OKAY BACK THERE?

211
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,630
COMFORTABLE?

212
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:54,101
WELL, THE MOTEL WE'RE PUTTING
YOU UP IN IS REALLY NICE.

213
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,570
YOU CAN WATCH TBS.

214
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,005
DO YOU HAVE TBS
IN VENEZUELA?

215
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,174
- I HAVE EVERYTHING
IN VENEZUELA.

216
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,011
I HAVE FOUR SATELLITE DISHES
ON MY ESTATE.

217
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,648
WE GET 14,000 CHANNELS.

218
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,182
14,000.

219
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,585
I ALREADY KNOW
WHO WINS PROJECT RUNWAY.

220
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,588
- WOW, I'M COMING
OVER TO YOUR HOUSE, THEN.

221
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:16,056
- I SEE WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT,
BUT, NO, THANK YOU.

222
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,126
I AM STILL PRIMARILY INTERESTED
IN THE LARGE BLACK WOMAN.

223
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,062
- MM.

224
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,299
HERE WE ARE.
TAKE IT IN, BOYS.

225
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,968
- THIS IS AN EMBARRASSMENT
TO AMERICA.

226
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:28,836
- I'M SORRY?

227
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,904
- YOU ARE RIGHT
TO WANT TO CORRECT THIS.

228
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,105
- CORRECT WHAT?

229
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:32,973
- THIS IS THE GIANT
PIT OF DIRT

230
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,307
YOU WERE TELLING US ABOUT,
IS IT NOT?

231
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:37,678
THE ONE YOU WANT TO TURN
INTO A PARK?

232
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,814
- NO, NO.
THIS IS ALREADY A PARK.

233
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:43,150
AND IT'S ONE
OF OUR BEST-LOVED PARKS.

234
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,152
- WHY ARE THE TREES SO SMALL?

235
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,153
- THEY'RE NOT THAT SMALL.

236
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,155
BESIDES, SIZE DOESN'T MATTER.

237
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,257
- YES, IT DOES.

238
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,059
OUR TREES ARE HUGE.

239
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,061
WE BUILD TUNNELS THROUGH THEM.

240
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,712
- THE PARKS IN BORAQUA
ARE FAR SUPERIOR.

241
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,181
THE PARK IN MY HOMETOWN,
THE PARQUE DEL ESTE,

242
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,751
WE HAVE A MONORAIL,
AND WE HAVE AN AQUARIUM.

243
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,921
AND THE JARIPA AMPHITHEATRE
IS HUGE.

244
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,389
- LADY GAGA PLAYED
THERE LAST WEEK.

245
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,057
- GREAT, WELL, WE DON'T HAVE
LADY GAGA.

246
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,326
AND I DON'T THINK SHE'S GOING
TO COME HERE

247
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,129
UNLESS HER CAREER
TAKES A VERY BAD TURN.

248
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,999
BUT WE HAVE SOMETHING
MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN LADY GAGA.

249
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:32,966
DEMOCRACY.

250
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,735
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
AN EXAMPLE OF THAT.

251
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,170
LET'S GO TO
A TOWN-HALL MEETING.

252
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:40,373
- ELVIS.
OH, HENRY!

253
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,677
RAUL, BUTTERFINGER.

254
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:47,314
ANTONIO, NESTLE CRUNCH
WITH THE CRISPY RICE REMOVED.

255
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:52,452
WEIRD CHOICE, BUT FOR YOU
I GOT IT DONE.

256
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,888
- GRACIAS, SEÃ‘OR.

257
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:55,989
- GRACIAS.

258
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,424
I FIND IT
INCREDIBLY DEMEANING,

259
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,759
BUT, GUESS WHAT?

260
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,227
* CASH MONEY

261
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,997
* I'M GOING TO MAKE IT RAIN

262
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,033
I'M JUST GOING TO PICK THAT UP
REAL QUICK.

263
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,869
- SO ARE YOU GUYS READY?
WE'RE ABOUT TO START.

264
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,470
- THIS IS WHERE
YOU HAVE YOUR MEETINGS?

265
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,840
- WELL, THE LOCATION ROTATES.

266
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,208
SOMETIMES WE HAVE THEM
ON THE VOLLEYBALL COURTS.

267
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,177
- [chuckles]

268
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,912
- WHERE DO YOU HOLD
YOUR MEETINGS?

269
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:21,782
- WELL, NOW THAT YOU ASKED,
WE USUALLY ROTATE AS WELL

270
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:24,852
BETWEEN DIFFERENT FORTRESSES
AND CITADELS AND PALACES.

271
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,487
- MM, WE DON'T NEED PALACES.

272
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,124
THE IDEAS ARE WHAT SHINE
IN OUR MEETINGS.

273
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,360
- WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF MORON?

274
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,963
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE HAND DRYERS
IN THE PARK BATHROOMS?

275
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:39,232
THEY'RE SO MUCH MORE SANITARY
THAN PAPER TOWELS!

276
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,367
ANYONE KNOWS THAT!

277
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,803
- MY DOG WENT
TO ONE OF YOUR PARKS

278
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,204
AND ATE ANOTHER DOG'S FECES,

279
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,439
AND I AM GOING TO SUE YOU
FOR THAT.

280
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,175
- HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?
- [screams]

281
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,977
- HUH?
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

282
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,178
- [screams]

283
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,913
- NOW IMAGINE
YOU'RE HOLDING COFFEE!

284
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,381
- THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

285
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,183
WHERE ARE THE ARMED MEN
WHO COME IN

286
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,218
TO TAKE THE PROTESTORS AWAY?
WHERE ARE THEY?

287
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:01,521
THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR
IS NEVER TOLERATED IN BORAQUA.

288
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,057
YOU SHOUT LIKE THAT,
THEY PUT YOU IN JAIL.

289
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,959
RIGHT AWAY.

290
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,060
NO TRIAL, NO NOTHING.

291
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:10,163
JOURNALISTS--WE HAVE
A SPECIAL JAIL FOR JOURNALISTS.

292
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,032
YOU ARE STEALING--
RIGHT TO JAIL.

293
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,767
YOU'RE PLAYING MUSIC
TOO LOUD--RIGHT TO JAIL.

294
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:14,768
RIGHT AWAY.

295
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,003
YOU'RE DRIVING TOO FAST?
JAIL.

296
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,004
SLOW? JAIL.

297
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,173
YOU'RE CHARGING
TOO HIGH PRICES FOR SWEATERS,

298
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,342
GLASSES,
YOU RIGHT TO JAIL.

299
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,045
YOU UNDERCOOK FISH--
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, JAIL.

300
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,048
YOU OVERCOOK CHICKEN--
ALSO JAIL.

301
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,149
UNDERCOOK, OVERCOOK.

302
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,517
YOU MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH A DENTIST

303
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,052
AND YOU DON'T SHOW UP,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, JAIL.

304
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:32,986
RIGHT AWAY.

305
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,055
WE HAVE THE BEST PATIENTS
IN THE WORLD...

306
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,857
BECAUSE OF JAIL.

307
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,228
- WELL, IT WAS TOUGH GOING,
BUT IT WAS LIVELY.

308
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,030
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THE OPEN FORUM?

309
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,865
- THIS MEETING
OF UGLY PEOPLE YELLING--

310
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,166
IT IS LIKE TORTURE.

311
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,835
- THAT'S ONE PERSPECTIVE.

312
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:48,836
- IN BORAQUA,
THE GOVERNMENT MOVES

313
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,071
LIKE A HOT KNIFE
THROUGH BUTTER.

314
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,206
I'M SUPPOSED TO SIT HERE
AND LISTEN TO PEOPLE YELLING,

315
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,843
THESE FAT FACES
TURNING ALL RED.

316
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,210
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WE'RE LIKE KINGS.

317
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,246
WE WALK DOWN THE STREET,
AND THEY TREAT US

318
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,547
LIKE ROCK STARS.

319
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,950
WE ANSWER TO NOBODY.

320
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,052
- WELL, IN A TRUE DEMOCRACY,
WE BELIEVE

321
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,922
THAT THE INPUT OF OUR CITIZENS
IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE.

322
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:12,425
- HEY, THESE PRETZELS SUCK.

323
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,861
- THANK YOU.

324
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:14,928
SEE?

325
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,264
- NO WONDER NOTHING EVER
GETS DONE IN THIS COUNTRY.

326
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,531
- REALLY?
NOTHING GETS DONE?

327
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,400
TELL THAT TO
THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE

328
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,601
OR AMERICAN IDOL

329
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,070
OR THE MOON.
OH, WAIT.

330
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,071
YOU CAN'T 'CAUSE
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.

331
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:27,274
- LOOK, THIS IS NOT PERSONAL.

332
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,076
WE JUST THINK
THAT YOU ARE WEAK,

333
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,311
AND YOUR CITY IS DISGUSTING.

334
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,846
- I THINK YOU'RE RUDE.

335
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,447
AND I THINK YOU'VE BEEN RUDE
SINCE YOU CAME HERE.

336
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,917
AND I THINK THAT
YOUR MEDALS ARE STUPID.

337
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,120
AND YOUR UNIFORM IS LAME.

338
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,222
AND YOU GUYS WANT TO MARRY
HUGO CHAVEZ.

339
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,124
- HEY...

340
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,926
DO NOT DISRESPECT CHAVEZ.

341
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,595
- STUPID CHAVEZ.

342
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,197
- I JUST TOLD YOU
NOT TO DISRESPECT HIM.

343
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,298
- GOOD, I JUST DID.
- THAT'S TWICE.

344
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,232
- I DON'T LIKE CHAVEZ.

345
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,167
- YES, YOU DO,
AND DO NOT DISRESPECT HIM.

346
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,602
- NO, I DON'T.
- YES, YOU DO.

347
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,137
- NO, I DON'T, RAUL.

348
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,973
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T
LIKE IT HERE, THEN GO.

349
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,074
OKAY, RAUL?

350
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,609
- GREAT.
- GOOD, SHUT UP.

351
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,244
- WE'RE SHUTTING UP, YEAH.

352
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,980
HERE WE GO.

353
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,216
- NOS VAMOS.
- THOSE ARE OUR PENS.

354
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,217
- GREAT.
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THEM.

355
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,952
- GREAT.
THEN DON'T TAKE THEM.

356
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:15,889
- WE DIDN'T.

357
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:18,191
- THEY STARTED IT.

358
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,363
- LOOK, THOSE GUYS
WERE RUDE, ARROGANT,

359
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,098
NARROW-MINDED, CLASS-A JERKS.

360
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,100
NOW, I MAY HAVE LOST MY COOL,
BUT THEY DESERVED IT.

361
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:30,603
- OKAY, I'LL CALL THE MAYOR
AND CANCEL THE PHOTO-OP.

362
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:31,671
- NO, DON'T DO THAT.

363
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,474
- OKAY, THEN CALL
THE VENEZUELANS AND APOLOGIZE.

364
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,978
- NO, THEY WERE RUDE, ARROGANT,
NARROW-MINDED, CLASS-A JERKS.

365
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:41,014
- OKAY, THEN I'LL CALL THE MAYOR
AND CANCEL THE PHOTO-OP.

366
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,216
- NO.

367
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,617
- DO YOU SEE
THE PROBLEM HERE?

368
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:47,387
- YES, BUT I DON'T WANT TO.

369
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,122
YESTERDAY I WAS
TOUGH AND DIRECT.

370
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:51,291
AND TODAY
I HAVE TO BE CHARMING.

371
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,994
BASICALLY, YESTERDAY
I WAS HILLARY CLINTON,

372
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,963
AND TODAY I'M BILL.
- GRACIAS.

373
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,630
CAN I GET ANYONE
ANYTHING TO DRINK

374
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,499
BEFORE WE START--
COFFEE, BRANDY?

375
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,934
- I'D LOVE SOME COFFEE.

376
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,103
- ANYTHING, GUYS?
SOME NUTS?

377
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,671
- I'LL HAVE SOME NUTS.
- GUMMI BEARS.

378
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,239
- SURE.
- APPLE CRISPS.

379
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,307
- YEAH.
- GRANOLA BARS.

380
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,308
- I'LL TAKE THOSE.

381
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,177
- NOTHING?
SURE?

382
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,479
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT OUT THERE
IF YOU NEED ME.

383
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:16,449
- WELL, RAUL, GENTLEMEN,
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

384
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,451
I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO FIRST SAY

385
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,553
I AM SO SORRY
FOR BLOWING UP YESTERDAY.

386
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,455
IT WAS COMPLETELY UNCALLED FOR.

387
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:25,225
- WELL, WE ARE SORRY AS WELL.

388
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,227
WE WERE VERY TIRED
FROM OUR LONG JOURNEY.

389
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,661
- ALSO, WE WERE
A BIT JEALOUS.

390
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:31,198
OUR COLLEAGUES FROM CARACAS
ARE VISITING

391
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,433
THEIR SISTER CITY OF MIAMI.
- YEAH.

392
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,702
- THEY'VE BEEN PARTYING
WITH DWYANE WADE.

393
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,371
THEY SENT US ALL THESE PHOTOS
AND QUICKTIME FILES,

394
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:41,174
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO SEE
THIS PLACE MIAMI, JUST GORGEOUS.

395
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,376
EVERYTHING--THERE'S SO MUCH
SOUL AND LIFE.

396
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,145
EVERYWHERE--
EVERY LITTLE, TINY STREET.

397
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,347
SO MUCH CULTURE AND HISTORY,
AND THE CARS--

398
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,016
PEOPLE REALLY TAKE CARE
OF THEIR CARS THERE.

399
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,550
- I NOTICED THAT
IN THE PICTURES.

400
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,286
- THEY'RE A LITTLE OLDER
BUT STILL JUST BEAUTIFUL.

401
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,587
IT'S REALLY, REALLY NICE,
AND THE FOOD--

402
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,523
SO SPICY AND WONDERFUL.

403
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,292
WE COULD NOT EVEN BELIEVE.

404
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:02,762
BUT PAWNEE IS
REALLY GOOD AS WELL.

405
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,632
IN ANY CASE,
I MADE A FEW PHONE CALLS,

406
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,568
AND, UH,
THE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA

407
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:13,573
HAS AUTHORIZED
A SPECIAL GIFT FOR YOU.

408
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:19,512
[laughs]

409
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,248
- $35,000?

410
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,016
- YES, IT IS TO FILL YOUR PIT,

411
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,319
TO START TO BUILD A PARK.

412
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,088
- OH, NO, NO.
WE CAN'T TAKE THIS.

413
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,522
- YES, YES, YES,
PLEASE.

414
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,724
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER TODAY
AT THE PHOTO OPPORTUNITY.

415
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,561
AND I THINK WE ARE GOOD HERE.

416
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:35,795
NO?
Â¿TODO BIEN?

417
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,796
- BUENO, RAUL.
- OKAY.

418
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,665
- UN POCO BRUTA,
PERO SE LO HIZO CLARO.

419
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,367
- OKAY, GRACIAS.

420
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,634
- GRACIAS.
- GOOD MEETING.

421
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,405
- AH, I DON'T KNOW.

422
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,673
MAYBE I SHOULD
RETURN THE MONEY.

423
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,375
IT'S FROM
A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.

424
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,642
I DON'T REALLY
TRUST THESE GUYS.

425
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,643
I'M GOING TO RETURN THE MONEY.
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

426
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,580
YOU COULD BUY A LOW-END LEXUS
WITH THAT MONEY.

427
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,748
- OR YOU COULD BUILD A PARK
WITH THAT MONEY.

428
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:56,816
- LET'S LOOK
AT THE PROS AND CONS.

429
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,619
- PRO, WE COULD FILL IN THE PIT
AND BUILD A PARK.

430
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,621
- CON, WE MIGHT BE FILLING IT IN
WITH DIRTY MONEY.

431
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,523
- PRO, $35,000
WORTH OF DIRTY MONEY.

432
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,592
- CON, NOT QUITE SURE
WHY THAT'S A PRO.

433
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,759
- PRO, WE CAN FILL IN
THE PIT.

434
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,528
- CON, ANN ALREADY SAID THAT.

435
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,298
UGH, PRO AND CON NEVER WORKS.

436
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,499
- PRO, YES, IT DOES.

437
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,769
- UGH--
I DON'T--UGH.

438
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,540
FINE, FINE.
WE'LL KEEP THE MONEY, OKAY?

439
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,242
EVERYBODY HAPPY?
JERRY, ARE YOU HAPPY?

440
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,344
- WHAT DID I DO?
- MEETING ADJOURNED, JERRY.

441
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,714
- CAN I JUST SAY, I STILL FEEL
KIND OF WEIRD ABOUT THIS MONEY.

442
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,451
- OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW
THEY'VE GIVEN YOU A HARD TIME.

443
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,253
WHEN THE MAYOR GETS HERE,
WE'LL DO THE PHOTO-OP,

444
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,554
THEY'LL BE OUT OF OUR HAIR.

445
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,790
YOU'LL GET TO BUILD YOUR PARK.

446
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,492
- AH, LESLIE, HELLO.
- RAUL.

447
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:15,495
THE MAYOR WILL BE WITH US
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES.

448
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:16,496
- IF YOU DON'T MIND,
WE WOULD LIKE

449
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,898
TO TAKE A VIDEO OF YOU
TO SHOW OUR SUPERIORS.

450
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,600
- OH, OKAY, SURE.

451
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,868
- DO YOU HAVE THE CHECK
THAT WE GAVE TO YOU?

452
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,204
- UH, YES, I DO.
[clears throat]

453
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,805
- OKAY, YOU CAN SHOW IT
TO THE CAMERA,

454
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:30,410
AND SAY HOW MUCH IT IS
AND WHAT IT IS FOR.

455
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,346
- OKAY, THIS IS A CHECK
FOR $35,000,

456
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,582
AND IT IS TO BUILD A PARK.

457
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,783
- HOW GENEROUS.

458
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,319
- YES, IT'S REALLY GENEROUS.

459
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,254
- NOW SAY, "VIVA VENEZUELA."

460
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,722
- VIVA VENEZUELA.

461
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:45,592
- VIVA CHAVEZ.

462
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,560
- THANK YOU, VENEZUELA.

463
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:48,828
- VIVA CHAVEZ--SAY IT.

464
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,564
- AH, COME ON.

465
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,567
I--I DON'T WANT TO VIVA
THAT GUY.

466
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:58,171
- WE JUST GAVE YOU $35,000.
THAT'S WORTH ONE VIVA.

467
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,279
- VIVA CHAVEZ.

468
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,914
- YES, VIVA CHAVEZ.

469
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,582
GRACIAS.

470
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,451
- YEAH.

471
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,654
- ENTONCES...

472
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,890
- WHAT IS HE SAYING?

473
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:21,394
- UM, THEY ARE VERY HAPPY.

474
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:24,497
THEY SAY HUGO CHAVEZ
WILL LOVE THIS VIDEO,

475
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:27,834
BECAUSE IT IS ANOTHER SUCCESS
FOR THEIR COMMITTEE.

476
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,469
- COMMITTEE?

477
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,570
- YEAH.

478
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:34,774
THEY'RE A COMMITTEE
TO HUMILIATE AND SHAME AMERICA.

479
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,609
- GONNA BE A GOOD VIDEO.

480
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:40,347
- THE COMMITTEE TO HUMILIATE
AND SHAME AMERICA?

481
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,550
- YES, IT IS HUGO CHAVEZ'S
PASSION PROJECT.

482
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,552
OH, WE JUST HAD AN IDEA.

483
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,487
WHY DON'T YOU CALL YOUR PARK
AFTER CHAVEZ?

484
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,589
DO YOU KNOW, YOU CALL IT,
"HUGO CHAVEZ PARK."

485
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,559
AND YOU CAN HAVE
A NICE BIG FOUNTAIN OF HIS HEAD

486
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,527
SO THAT WHEN THE WATER
IS COMING OUT,

487
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:57,364
HE'S SPITTING AT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

488
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,798
YOU SHOULD WRITE THIS DOWN.

489
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,671
- VIVA AMERICA.

490
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,573
VIVA PAWNEE.

491
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,941
VIVA MAYOR WALTER GUNDERSON.

492
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,477
- YOU HAVE OFFENDED US.

493
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,513
YOU HAVE OFFENDED
THE GOVERNMENT OF BORAQUA.

494
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,283
YOU ARE NO LONGER OUR SISTER.

495
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,618
VAMONOS. RAPIDO.

496
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,388
- NO, AMERICA IS NOT PERFECT.

497
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:25,658
BUT DIPLOMACY ISN'T JUST
SUCKING UP AND BEING A PUSHOVER.

498
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,795
SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO GET TOUGH.

499
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:32,265
I AM GOING TO BUILD
THAT PARK MYSELF,

500
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,800
AND IT IS GOING TO BE AWESOME.

501
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,303
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE
A FOUNTAIN

502
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,037
SHAPED LIKE
HUGO CHAVEZ'S HEAD

503
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,373
SPITTING WATER
ALL OVER EVERYONE,

504
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,576
UNLESS THAT'S WHAT
THE PEOPLE WANT.

505
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,280
AND THAT, SIR,
IS DEMOCRACY.

506
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,585
- LESLIE, COME SEE THIS.

507
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,354
CHECK OUT THIS VIDEO
THAT APRIL SENT ME.

508
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:57,757
- HEY, GUYS, I'M AT
JHONNY'S PLACE IN VENEZUELA.

509
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,292
IT'S OKAY, I GUESS.

510
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:01,594
HE HAS, LIKE, 5 MILLION ROOMS.

00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,029
AND THIS IS ONLY
HIS GUEST HOUSE.

00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:03,896
