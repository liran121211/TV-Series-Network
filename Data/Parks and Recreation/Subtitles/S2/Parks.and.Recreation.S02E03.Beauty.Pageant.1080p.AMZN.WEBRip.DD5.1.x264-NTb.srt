1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:02,803
- GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.
COUPLE ANNOUNCEMENTS.

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,372
AS WE ALL KNOW,
RON IS RECOVERING

3
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:05,539
FROM HIS HERNIA SURGERY,

4
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,508
SO I GOT HIM FLOWERS
FROM ALL OF US.

5
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,343
SO EVERYBODY NEEDS TO PITCH IN,
LIKE, $90.

6
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:10,378
- $90?

7
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,479
- YES.

8
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:15,449
BECAUSE I ORDERED A BEAUTIFUL
BOUQUET OF DAFFODILS

9
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,085
FROM A WEBSITE

10
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,619
AFTER A FEW GLASSES
OF WINE.

11
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:22,423
SO, TOM, I THINK YOU MIGHT BE
GETTING SOME DAFFODILS TOO.

12
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,058
DONNA,
YOU'RE DEFINITELY GETTING SOME.

13
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:25,093
JERRY, I DON'T KNOW.

14
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,094
I'M NOT SURE.

15
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:27,495
TIME WILL TELL.

16
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,598
ALSO, I'M LEAVING EARLY TONIGHT
BECAUSE I AM A JUDGE

17
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,733
IN THE MISS PAWNEE
BEAUTY PAGEANT.

18
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,535
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, YOU GET
TO BE A JUDGE IN THAT THING?

19
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:35,503
- YES,
AND IT'S A RESPONSIBILITY

20
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,205
I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY.

21
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:38,606
- BUT I WANT TO BE A JUDGE.

22
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,109
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LIKE BEAUTY PAGEANTS.

23
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:42,643
- APRIL, WHOEVER MISS PAWNEE IS,

24
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:43,811
IS GONNA BE THE REPRESENTATIVE
OF WOMANHOOD

25
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:44,612
IN OUR TOWN.

26
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,547
AND AS A JUDGE,
LET ME ASSURE YOU

27
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,516
THAT THIS YEAR'S MISS PAWNEE
WILL BE CHOSEN

28
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,418
FOR HER TALENT AND POISE.

29
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,153
- WHOA, THE GIRLS FROM TALENT
AND POISE ARE GONNA BE THERE?

30
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:53,221
- WHAT?

31
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,555
- TALENT AND POISE.

32
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,424
IT'S A STRIP CLUB
BY THE V.A. HOSPITAL.

33
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:57,625
I HAVE SOME MEETINGS THERE.

34
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:58,626
- UH, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

35
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,529
- NO, WHAT'S DISGUSTING
IS THE GLITTER FACTORY.

36
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,631
DO NOT GO
TO THE GLITTER FACTORY.

37
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,434
[triumphant music]

38
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:14,475
*

39
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:37,398
- HEY!

40
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,367
- HEY.

41
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,435
- SO I WAS JUST
AT THE GRIND,

42
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,271
AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
AN ICED MOCHA

43
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,639
WITH EXTRA, EXTRA
WHIPPED CREAM.

44
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:48,409
- OH, MY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, APRIL.

45
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,910
WOW.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

46
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,512
OH, BY THE WAY,

47
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,514
COMPLETELY UNRELATED,

48
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:56,684
I JUST SIGNED UP FOR
THE MISS PAWNEE BEAUTY PAGEANT.

49
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,186
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.

50
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,820
YOU KNOW, THAT IS WHY
I DECIDED

51
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,622
TO BECOME A JUDGE.

52
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,591
SO THAT AWESOME GIRLS
LIKE YOU,

53
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,526
WHO ARE NOT, YOU KNOW,
CLASSICALLY HOT,

54
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,462
CAN BE REWARDED FOR THEIR
INTELLIGENCE AND SAVVY.

55
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,631
- BEAUTY PAGEANTS
ARE IDIOTIC,

56
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,501
BUT I FOUND THAT THE WINNER
OF THE MISS PAWNEE PAGEANT

57
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,735
GETS $600.

58
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,338
I CAN BE IDIOTIC
FOR $600.

59
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,341
SO ARE YOU GONNA VOTE
FOR ME, SISTER?

60
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,444
- APRIL, IT'S UNETHICAL FOR ME
TO SHOW YOU FAVORITISM.

61
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,745
YOU AND I
ARE LIKE FAMILY.

62
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,648
- THE COFFEE'S $7.

63
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,749
- YES, RIGHT, OF COURSE.

64
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,551
- JUST BUMP THAT CLOWN.

65
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,587
TELL HIM THEY ALREADY HAVE
ANOTHER ASIAN JUDGE.

66
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:34,588
AWESOME.

67
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:35,889
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I OWE YOU.

68
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,758
A'IGHT, PEACE.

69
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,195
GUESS WHO'S ALSO GONNA BE
A JUDGE IN THE BEAUTY PAGEANT.

70
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:42,530
- WHAT?
HOW?

71
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:43,631
- I KNOW A GUY.

72
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,433
I HAD TO CALL IN
A FEW FAVORS.

73
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,701
BUT IF YOU DON'T CALL IN FAVORS
TO LOOK AT WOMEN IN BIKINIS

74
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:48,936
AND ASSIGN THEM
NUMERICAL GRADES,

75
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,171
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
CALL IN FAVORS FOR?

76
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:53,574
- HEY.

77
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,209
- HEY.
- HEY.

78
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:57,611
- HEY.
- WHAT YOU DOING IN THESE PARTS?

79
00:02:57,645 --> 00:03:00,848
- OH, I JUST--I CAME BY
TO SEE THE MURALS.

80
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,417
- OH.
- THIS ONE'S PRETTY AMAZING.

81
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:04,685
- YEAH, THIS ONE'S A BEAUTY.

82
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,355
YOU KNOW, IN THE 1880s,
THERE WERE A FEW YEARS

83
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,423
THAT WERE PRETTY ROUGH
AND TUMBLE IN PAWNEE.

84
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:12,260
THIS DEPICTS KIND OF
A FAMOUS FIGHT

85
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:15,763
BETWEEN REVEREND BRADLEY
AND ANNA BETH STEVENSON,

86
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,665
A WIDOWED MOTHER
OF SEVEN.

87
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,801
THE ORIGINAL TITLE OF THIS
WAS "A LIVELY FISTING."

88
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,903
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THEY HAD TO CHANGE IT.

89
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,638
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

90
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,440
- SHE'S GOT HIM BY THE HAIR
PRETTY GOOD THERE.

91
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:27,508
- YEAH.

92
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,710
- LESLIE'S REALLY COOL.

93
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,512
AND SHE'S SMART.

94
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,646
IT'S A LITTLE INTIMIDATING.

95
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,582
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

96
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,684
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO LOOK AT THE MURALS.

97
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,587
I CAME TO ASK HER
ON A DATE.

98
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,756
HEY, LESLIE...

99
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,893
I REALLY--
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

100
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,529
AND I WAS WONDERING

101
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,432
IF YOU MAYBE WANT TO GET A CUP
OF COFFEE SOME TIME.

102
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,801
- OKAY. YEAH, SURE.

103
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,569
- YEAH?
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

104
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,037
LET ME CHECK
MY SCHEDULE.

105
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,539
- OKAY.

106
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,507
LET'S SEE...

107
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,776
- AH, IS THAT YOUR--
IS THAT YOUR GRANDMA?

108
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,745
- [laughs]

109
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,948
YEAH.

110
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,984
IT'S MADELEINE ALBRIGHT.

111
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,520
- THAT'S HER NAME?

112
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,755
I USUALLY JUST CALL MINE NANA.

113
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,558
- NO, THAT'S MADELEINE ALBRIGHT.

114
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,727
FIRST FEMALE SECRETARY
OF STATE.

115
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,831
- OKAY, SO NOT--
THAT'S NOT YOUR GRANDMA THEN.

116
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,600
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT IT.

117
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,068
HOW'S THAT SCHEDULE LOOKING?

118
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,537
- GOOD.
A COUPLE DAYS ARE FREE.

119
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,638
MAYBE WE COULD JUST,
YOU KNOW...

120
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,672
- LOCK IT IN LATER?

121
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:32,840
- YEAH.
- TALK LATER ABOUT IT?

122
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,508
- YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
- OKAY.

123
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,847
LADIES.

124
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,651
- WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING AWFUL?

125
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:46,554
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHO MADELEINE ALBRIGHT WAS.

126
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:47,788
- WHO?

127
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,357
- NOT YOU TOO.

128
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,724
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT,
FIRST FEMALE SECRETARY OF STATE.

129
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,059
- N-NO, WHO DIDN'T KNOW?

130
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:55,596
- OH, DAVE.
THAT COP THAT I MET.

131
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,530
I DON'T KNOW.

132
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:57,331
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DATE SOMEONE

133
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:58,932
WHO DOESN'T SHARE
MY INTERESTS.

134
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,634
I MEAN, COULD YOU DATE

135
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:03,103
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T

136
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,304
LOVE GIVING VACCINATIONS?

137
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:07,741
- I'VE NEVER DATED ANYONE
WHO LOVES GIVING VACCINATIONS.

138
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:10,878
[knock at door]

139
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,613
- HEY.
- HEY.

140
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,781
WEIRD QUESTION FOR YOU.

141
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,684
ARE YOU HANDY?
LIKE, CAN YOU FIX THINGS?

142
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:17,718
- WHAT'S BROKEN?

143
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,786
- MY SHOWER.

144
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,754
IT'S LEAKY, LOW PRESSURE,

145
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,022
JUST ALL AROUND TERRIBLE.

146
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,357
- UH, EASY.

147
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:24,658
YOU WANT ME TO COME OVER
AFTER WORK?

148
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,759
- YES!

149
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:26,960
YES, AMAZING.

150
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,597
I WILL COOK YOU
A CHEAP, QUICK DINNER

151
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,565
THAT WILL BE NO TROUBLE
AT ALL FOR ME.

152
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:32,566
- GREAT.

153
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,634
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT

154
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,068
FOR THE WEIRDEST SECOND DATE
EVER.

155
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,704
- OKAY.

156
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,038
- HELLO, FELLOW JUDGES.

157
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,708
I'M JUDGE LESLIE KNOPE,

158
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,476
AND THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE,
TOM HAVERFORD,

159
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,711
WHO'S ALSO GONNA BE A JUDGE.

160
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,580
- HI, JESSICA WICKS,
MISS PAWNEE 1994.

161
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:48,749
- I RECOGNIZED YOU
RIGHT AWAY.

162
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,984
AND MAY I SAY THAT YOU LOOK
EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL NOW

163
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,019
THAN YOU DID
WHEN YOU WON THE CROWN.

164
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,954
- OOH, I LIKE YOU.

165
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,624
- RAY HOLSTEAD,
RAY'S SANDWICH PLACE.

166
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,592
- YES, OF COURSE, RAY.
HOW DO YOU DO?

167
00:05:58,626 --> 00:05:59,760
- I'M CHARLES WOLINER.

168
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,629
I'VE JUDGED
EVERY MISS PAWNEE PAGEANT

169
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,631
FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS.
- WOW.

170
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,466
- I MADE JESSICA.

171
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,135
- HMM, WELL, TOM AND I
ARE VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE.

172
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,504
AND I'M SURE,
BETWEEN THE FIVE OF US,

173
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,105
WE WILL CHOOSE
THE MOST WELL-ROUNDED,

174
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,907
INTELLIGENT,
MODERN,

175
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,877
AND FORWARD-THINKING WOMAN
TO REPRESENT OUR FINE TOWN.

176

I'M A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED

I HAVE A REAL QUESTION.

CALLED AMERICA

00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,098

335
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:48,869
WHAT CAN WE DO AS CITIZENS
TO IMPROVE ON THAT EXPERIMENT?

336
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:51,805
- UM, WELL...

337
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,843
I THINK THAT AMERICA
IS THE LAND

338
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:59,012
OF THE FREE,
WHICH IS A WONDERFUL THING,

339
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,914
AND ALSO THE BRAVE,

340
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,050
WHERE PEOPLE CAN LIVE.

341
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,219
AND NO ONE CAN EVER TAKE THAT
AWAY FROM YOU.

342
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,521
AND IT NEVER GIVES UP.

343
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:12,225
BUT THE HIGH BIRTHING RATE
OF IMMIGRANTS FRIGHTENS ME.

344
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,327
NO OFFENSE TO ANYONE OUT THERE,

345
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,063
BUT IF IT WERE UP TO ME

346
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:16,897
AND MY FAMILY,

347
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,532
I WOULD ACTUALLY CALL IT
OUR AMERICA

348
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:20,868
AND NOT THEIR AMERICA.

00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,103

MY QUESTION.

353
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,911
- I'M SORRY,
YOU DON'T THINK IT'S WEIRD

354
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,946
THAT MY EX-BOYFRIEND LIVES
IN A TENT

355
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,848
IN THE PIT
OUTSIDE MY HOUSE?

356
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:38,952
- IT'S NOT IDEAL.

357
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,287
UH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
TO RELAX.

358
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,289
MAYBE TAKE ONE OF THOSE ATAVINS

359
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,523
I SAW IN THE MEDICINE CABINET.

360
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,092
- DUDE.

361
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:45,893
- YEAH, I PEEKED.

362
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,060
I ALSO DIDN'T SEE
ANY TOOTHPASTE.

363
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,929
DO YOU NOT USE TOOTHPASTE?

364
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,297
- I MEAN, I ALWAYS KNEW
HE WAS LAZY,

365
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,500
BUT THIS IS LIKE A NEW LOW
FOR HIM.

366
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,068
[thunder crashes]

367
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:56,970
- I FEEL LIKE
WE SHOULD INVITE HIM INSIDE.

368
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,072
- HAVE YOU NOT BEEN LISTENING
TO ANYTHING I JUST SAID?

369
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,942
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S RAINING OUTSIDE.

370
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:06,013
AND HE'S LIVING IN A PIT,
YOU KNOW?

371
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,547
- [groans]

372
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,949
- OKAY, FOLKS,
JUST A COUPLE MORE CONTESTANTS,

373
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,984
AND THEN THE JUDGES WILL DECIDE

374
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,253
OUR NEXT MISS PAWNEE,

375
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,923
A WINNER OF $600
IN GIFT CERTIFICATES

376
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:19,226
TO BIG ARCHIE'S SPORTING GOODS
AND EMERSON FENCING COMPANY.

377
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,928
- WHAT?
WE DON'T GET CASH?

378
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,195
THIS IS FOR A FENCE?

379
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,463
- WELL, IT WON'T COVER
A WHOLE FENCE,

380
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,565
BUT IT WILL DEFRAY
THE COST CONSIDERABLY.

381
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:29,169
- OH, MY GOD.

382
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,537
I QUIT.

383
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,641
I QUIT.

384
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,977
- OKAY.
I GUESS SHE REALLY IS QUITTING.

385
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,411
- NO, I DIDN'T WIN.

386
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:42,249
BUT AT LEAST I DIDN'T MAKE
ANY NEW FRIENDSHIPS.

387
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,518
- SO HOW LONG DO WE HAVE
TO PRETEND TO DELIBERATE

388
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,553
TILL WE GET BACK OUT THERE?

389
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,922
[laughter]

390
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,257
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

391
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,658
- WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT.

392
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,493
THE HOT ONE,
BY A LANDSLIDE.

393
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,062
- WELL, HER NAME IS TRISH,

394
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,397
AND I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD RUSH THIS, YOU KNOW.

395
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,631
- WHAT IS THERE
TO TALK ABOUT?

396
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:01,368
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
TRISH WAS JUST ADORABLE.

397
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,136
- WELL, TAKE SUSAN,
FOR EXAMPLE.

398
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,338
I THINK--
- SUSAN "BORING STORIES"? NAH.

399
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,674
IT'S TRISH.
LET'S GO BACK OUT THERE.

400
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,010
- OKAY, HOLD ON, EVERYONE.

401
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,579
HOLD ON.
EVERYONE, W-WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

402
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,648
LOOK, WHOEVER WE CHOOSE
IS GONNA REPRESENT

403
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,018
THE IDEAL WOMAN
FOR A YEAR.

404
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,519
SHE'LL BE SOMEONE
THAT LITTLE GIRLS

405
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,321
IN SOUTH-CENTRAL INDIANA
LOOK UP TO.

406
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,689
NOW NOBODY LEAVES THIS ROOM

407
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,992
UNTIL WE DISCUSS ALL OF IT,
OKAY?

408
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,360
CONSIDER YOURSELVES SEQUESTERED.

409
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,428
I'M A JUDGE,

410
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,163
SO I DON'T WANT
TO SOUND PARTIAL,

411
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:33,700
BUT TRISH WILL WIN THIS PAGEANT
OVER MY DEAD BODY.

412
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,071
- LOOK, I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE

413
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,440
WHO HAS ENTERED
AND WON THIS CONTEST

414
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,708
IN THE PAST.

415
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,676
AND I THINK TRISH
IS A NO-BRAINER.

416
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,046
- JESSICA, MAY I ASK,
WHAT WAS YOUR TALENT?

417
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,214
- OH, I PACKED A SUITCASE.

418
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,581
- I HAVE TO SAY,

419
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,683
LESLIE DOES MAKE
A GOOD POINT.

420
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,320
TRISH IS NOT THE BRIGHTEST BULB
IN THE BUNCH.

421
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,754
- YES, RAY, GOOD.

422
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,523
I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
LET'S KEEP TALKING.

423
00:15:56,556 --> 00:16:00,093
- JUST STAND OVER THERE,
AND DON'T DRIP ON ANYTHING.

424
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,202
- IS MARK THE GUY
WHO'S FIXING YOUR SHOWER?

425
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,438
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
MARK,

426
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,605
BUT I'VE SEEN
A TON OF PORN,

427
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,275
AND I KNOW WHAT FIXING
YOUR SHOWER MEANS.

428
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,076
- ANDY.

429
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,244
- SORRY, YOU GUYS
ARE ON A DATE.

430
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,378
THAT'S COOL.
- ANDY.

431
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:19,446
- NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

432
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,515
DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT
YOUR DATE.

433
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:23,516
- DIG IN.

434
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,684
- I ALREADY ATE.
I'M SUPER FULL.

435
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,587
I DON'T--
I DIDN'T WANT ANY.

436
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,690
- OKAY, SO IT'S STILL 3-2
FOR TRISH.

437
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,326
GUYS, ALL I ASK

438
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,562
IS THAT YOU LOOK
INTO YOUR HEARTS

439
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,563
AND THINK,
REALLY THINK,

440
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,299
ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE SEEN

441
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,767
AND ASK YOURSELVES,

442
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,336
WHO IS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE WOMAN
HERE TONIGHT?

443
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:49,776
- IT'S THE HOT ONE,
TRISH IANETTA.

444
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,046
[pageant music]

445
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,651
*

446
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,320
- THESE ARE AMAZING.

447
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,355
DO YOU--DO YOU PUT A LOT
OF HOT SAUCE

448
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,623
ON THESE OR SOMETHING?

449
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,758
- A GOOD CHEF NEVER REVEALS
HER SECRETS.

450
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:09,529
- IT'S HOT SAUCE.

451
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:13,166
ANN IS AN EXTRAORDINARY COOK.

452
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,335
MM.

453
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,336
MEMORIES.

454
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,639
- DO YOU WANT SOME MORE?
ARE YOU HUNGRY STILL?

455
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:20,607
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

456
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,175
I WAS JUST SITTING OVER HERE
ON THE COUCH,

457
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,710
AND I WAS THINKING

458
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,512
THAT THERE WAS ONCE A TIME
WHEN MARK USED TO BE

459
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,746
THE STRANGER IN THE HOUSE.

460
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,548
AND NOW IT'S ME.

461
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,123
- EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE.

462
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,625
UM, WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE
A MOMENT TO GIVE A ROUND

463
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,760
OF APPLAUSE TO ALL
THE CONTESTANTS THIS EVENING?

464
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,330
YES.
[applause]

465
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,599
ESPECIALLY SUSAN.

466
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:50,170
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT
SUSANS HAVE LOST TO TRISHES.

467
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:53,106
AND IT WON'T BE THE LAST.

468
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,508
SUSAN AND I WILL CONTINUE ON

469
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,677
UNTIL THE WOMEN OF PAWNEE
ARE JUDGED

470
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,680
NOT BY THE FLATNESS
OF THEIR TUMMIES,

471
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,649
BUT BY THE CONTENTS
OF THEIR BRAINS.

472
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:06,586
AND, TRISH,

473
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,288
I MAY NOT HAVE VOTED
FOR YOU,

474
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,423
BUT NOW IS A TIME

475
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,625
FOR US TO COME TOGETHER.

476
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,295
I HOPE YOU HONOR
THIS CROWN WITH DIGNITY

477
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,729
AND A DEVOTION TO--

478
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,365
- WHOO!

479
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,368
all: ONE, TWO, THREE.

480
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,804
[laughter]

481
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,375
- AS USUAL, ANN,
DELICIOUS MEAL.

482
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,811
ARE WE DOING ANYTHING IN THE WAY
OF DESSERT OR COFFEE?

483
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,846
- WE ARE LEAVING.

484
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,550
- OKAY, I GET IT.

485
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:41,554
DON'T WORRY. I'M VERY GOOD
AT PICKING UP SIGNALS.

486
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:42,755
LET'S GO, MARK.

487
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,357
- NO, DUMMY,
JUST YOU.

488
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:45,458
- OKAY.

489
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,360
ALL RIGHT.

490
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:52,399
- TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

491
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,666
- JUST DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME, ANN.

492
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,436
OKAY?

493
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:00,773
I'LL BE FINE.

494
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,611
THAT WENT REALLY WELL!

495
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,379
WE HAD DINNER,

496
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:07,747
I GOT TO SEE HER.

497
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,383
OH, GOD, I WAS SO TEMPTED
TO LOOK BACK AT HER.

498
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:11,684
WAS SHE LOOKING?

499
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,653
I HAD TO WALK SO SLOW.

500
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:14,654
AGH.

501
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:19,592
A GOOD DAY.

502
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,195
- WELL, WELL, WELL,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

503
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:23,596
IT'S OFFICER JOHN MCCLANE.

504
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,897
WELCOME TO THE PARTY,
PAL.

505
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,467
- WHO'S THAT?
- DIE HARD.

506
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,801
- BATTERY?

507
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,737
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

508
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,971
- WELL, YOU KNOW, THE OTHER DAY
I ASKED YOU

509
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:32,972
IF YOU WANTED
TO HAVE COFFEE?

510
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,541
- YEAH.
- YOU SAID YES.

511
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:35,675
- YES.
- OKAY.

512
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,810
AND THEN AFTERWARDS,
I SAW YOU AGAIN,

513
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:38,978
YOU KIND OF ACTED
LIKE YOU DIDN'T WANT

514
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,447
TO HAVE COFFEE ANYMORE.

515
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,515
WE LEFT IT KIND OF OPEN-ENDED.
- WE DID.

516
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,516
- AND THAT'S MADE ME
UNCOMFORTABLE.

517
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,717
- OKAY.

518
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:45,718
- SO I THOUGHT I'D COME IN
AND ASK YOU.

519
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,754
JUST GET SOME CLEARANCE
ON THIS.

520
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,756
- DAVE, I LIKE YOU.
- I LIKE YOU TOO.

521
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,658
OKAY, SO,
WE'LL GET COFFEE THEN.

522
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,760
- BUT I'M JUST BUSY.

523
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,796
RIGHT NOW,
MY SCHEDULE'S JUST SO...

524
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,666
- OKAY.
OKAY, I GET IT.

525
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,568
LOOK, I'M NOT A GUY
