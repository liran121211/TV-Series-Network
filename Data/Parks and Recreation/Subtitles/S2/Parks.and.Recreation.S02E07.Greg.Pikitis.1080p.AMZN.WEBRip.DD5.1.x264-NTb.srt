00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,752
- YOU'RE THE PARKS
LADY, RIGHT?

4
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:20,821

I'M THE PARKS LADY.

UGH, THIS KID

WE GOT A HISTORY,
GREG AND I.

00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,201
HE ABSOLUTELY TERRORIZES
THE PARK SYSTEM.

EVERY HALLOWEEN SOMEONE
DEFACES THE STATUE

OF MAYOR PERCY
AND RAMSETT PARK.

12
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,707
AND I KNOW
IT'S GREG PIKITIS,

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,609
BUT I'VE NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO PROVE IT.

14
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,512
HE'S LIKE AN INVISIBLE,
ADOLESCENT JAMES BOND

15

SUPER-VILLAIN
CRIMINAL MASTERMIND.

16
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,084
OR MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE
IS DOING IT.

17
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:51,719
BUT I REALLY FEEL LIKE
IT'S THIS KID.

18
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,454
GOT THE ENTIRE
PARKS DEPARTMENT WATCHING YOU,

19

MY BOYFRIEND'S A COP.

00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:58,092
SO DON'T EVEN TRY IT.

21
00:00:58,126 --> 00:00:59,193
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

22
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:00,561
- OH, I THINK YOU DO.

23
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,230
IT ENDS TODAY, PIKITIS.

24
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,165
IT ENDS...

25
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,567

00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:15,543

TONIGHT, 7:00, MY HOUSE,

00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,143
- MM.

00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:50,544
- COOL. OKAY.

38
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,181
HALLOWEEN IS
MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY.

39
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:54,248
IT'S JUST THE BEST.

40
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,916
AND I DON'T HAVE TO WORK.

41
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,153

OH, ONE MORE THING.

PLUS LESLIE AND DONNA,
SO DON'T TELL ANYBODY.

46
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,897

- HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON,
CUPCAKE?

48

EXCITED ABOUT
THE PARTY TONIGHT.

00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:18,606
- OH. OH, YOU'RE COMING.
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TELL YOU.

50
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,574
- JERRY ALREADY TOLD ME.

51
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:24,612
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
HOW TINY YOUR COSTUME IS.

52
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,280
WHAT TIME DOES IT START?

53
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,416
- 7:00.
- PERFECT.

54
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,718
- YEAH, IT'S PERFECT.

55
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,587
- CHECK THIS OUT.

56
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:34,788
THESE ARE ALL
THE POSSIBLE ROUTES

57
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:38,292
FROM GREG PIKITIS' HOUSE
TO THE STATUE.

58
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,627
- THAT LOOKS LIKE
SOMETHING YOU WOULD FIND

59
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,894
ON THE WALL
OF A SERIAL KILLER.

60
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,231
- IN A WAY THAT'S
A COMPLIMENT.

61
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,732
SHOWS DEDICATION.
- MM.

62
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,434
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
ANYWAY?

63
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,636
I MEAN, A KID
TPs SOME STATUE.

64
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,871
- AND ALL THE TREES
AND ALL THE BENCHES.

65
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,374
IT TAKES US, LIKE, TEN DAYS
TO CLEAN HIS MESS UP.

66
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,476
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
GREG PIKITIS SUCKS,

67
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,544
AND I WANT
TO DESTROY HIM.

68
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,712
- OKAY.

69
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:01,515
WELL, IF YOU DESTROY HIM EARLY,
PLEASE COME BY.

70
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,384
- I WILL.

71
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,553
HEY, HOW IS SOMEONE GONNA BE
ABLE TO GET THROUGH THAT DOOR?

72
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,255
- OH.

73
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,622
- OH! WHAT THE--

74
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,524
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

75
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,793
- JERRY, RELAX. HERE.

76
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,962
AH, WILLIAM PERCY.

77
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:18,499
ONE OF PAWNEE'S GREATEST MAYORS,
AND A TRUE HERO.

78
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,901
DURING THE PAWNEE BREAD FACTORY
FIRE OF 1922,

79
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,237
HE RAN BACK
INTO A BURNING BUILDING

80
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:25,839
AND SAVED THE BELOVED SECRET
RECIPE FOR PAWNEE PUMPERNICKEL.

81
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,509
- DIDN'T, LIKE,
30 PEOPLE DIE IN THAT FIRE?

82
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,545
- HE WASN'T SUPERMAN.

83
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,414
- HE LOOKS LIKE
RON SWANSON.

84
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,482
IS THAT WHO
THIS IS BASED ON?

85
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,517
- NO, IT'S BASED ON
WILLIAM PERCY.

86
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,851
WERE YOU LISTENING
TO WHAT I JUST SAID?

87
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,520
- YES.

88
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,622
- OKAY, ANDY. GOOD NEWS.

89
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,324

YOU SEE HIM, YOU STOP HIM.

93
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,665
KNOCK HIS HEAD OFF
IF YOU HAVE TO.

94
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:52,733
- DON'T DO THAT.
- DON'T DO THAT.

95
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,369
BUT I GIVE YOU PERMISSION
TO USE EXCESSIVE FORCE.

96
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,571
- DON'T USE EXCESSIVE FORCE.
- DON'T GO OVERBOARD.

97
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,306
JUST STOP HIM.

98
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,040
BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.
- NO.

99

- NO.

100
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,579
JUST STOP HIM.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

101
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:10,284
- A WEEK AGO, I HAD NOTHING.
NOW I HAVE A PART-TIME JOB,

102

NORMALLY I HATE
WORKING ON HALLOWEEN, BUT, UH,

132

IT'S NICE HANGING OUT
WITH LESLIE.

SHE'S COMMITTED,

AND, UH, SHE MADE OUT
WITH ME IN MY COP CAR.

- YEAH, HI.

143
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,689
IT'S TOTALLY OKAY
THAT YOU DIDN'T WEAR A COSTUME.

144
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:58,826
- I DID.
I'M A STRAIGHT PERSON.

145

LAME RIGHT NOW,

148
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,067
BUT WE'LL GET IT GOING.

- I PASSED UP A GAY
HALLOWEEN PARTY TO BE HERE.

150

DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH FUN
GAY HALLOWEEN PARTIES ARE?

151
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:13,974
LAST YEAR I SAW
THREE JONAS BROTHERS

152
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,009
MAKE OUT WITH
THREE ROBERT PATTINSONS.

153
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,412
IT WAS AMAZING.

154
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:20,113
- SO YOU'RE THE MARK
THAT ANN IS DATING.

155
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,516
- I SUPPOSE THAT I AM.

156
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,185
- WE'RE VERY PROTECTIVE OF ANN.
WE LOOK OUT FOR HER.

157
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,654
- SO YOU KIND OF
DROPPED THE BALL

00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:27,921
WITH ANDY, THEN,
DIDN'T YOU?

159
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:29,723
- OH, ANDY.

160
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,725

IS ANDY COMING TONIGHT?

162
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,695
- YOU SHOULD
GET BACK WITH ANDY.

163
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,630
- WHO NEEDS A DRINK?

164
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:37,665
I DO.

165
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,600
- SUSPECT LAUGHING
WITH FRIENDS

166
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:43,070
AND PLAYING WITH
HIS STUPID SKATEBOARD

167
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:46,607
IN A SNIDE,
TURD-ISH MANNER.

168
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,476
- "TURD-ISH"?

169
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,512
- YES. LIKE A TURD.
LIKE A LITTLE TURD.

170
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,312
- HEY, LISTEN.

171
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,515
YOUR SCARE TACTICS
CLEARLY WORKED,

00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,485
YOU GOT ANDY
GUARDING THE STATUE,

173
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:58,652
WHY DON'T WE GO
TO ANN'S PARTY?

174
00:06:58,686 --> 00:06:59,953
HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

175
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:03,724
OH, UH, WE WANTED
TO COVER THAT BLOCK ANYWAY.

176
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,759
WANTED A POLICE PRESENCE
ON IT, SO THAT'S--

177
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:08,696
THIS IS WITHIN THE BOU--
UH, CONFINES OF--

178
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:09,697
- SURE, LET'S GO.

179
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,698
- YEAH? OKAY.
- YEAH.

180
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,500
WE'LL GO BY MY OFFICE
AND PICK UP MY COSTUME.

181
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,567
- GOT IT.

182
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,568
- CAN'T WE JUST
FIRE A WARNING SHOT

183
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:15,603
OVER HIS HEAD
AS WE DRIVE BY?

184
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:16,604
- NO, BABE,
DON'T TOUCH THAT.

185
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:17,538
- UGH...

186
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:21,642
LEAVING LOCATION.
LOOK AT STUPID SUSPECT.

187
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,643
I HATE SUSPECT.

188
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,812
WHERE ARE MY KEYS?

189
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,514
- LOOKS LIKE IT'S OPEN.

190
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,549
- REALLY?

191
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:37,491
[gasps]

192
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,559
PIKITIS!

193
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,132
- WE'VE BEEN TAILING
THAT KID FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

194
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,200
I MEAN, IT MUST'VE
BEEN SOMEBODY ELSE.

195
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:50,871
- IT WAS PIKITIS.

196
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,640
BELIEVE ME NOW.

197
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,108
- THAT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING TO ME.

198
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,578
- THIS IS A PEACH PIT.
- OKAY.

199
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,548
- HE WAS EATING A PEACH
WHEN I WENT TO GO TALK TO HIM.

200
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,049
THIS IS HIS
ACE OF SPADES.

201
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:02,916
THIS IS HIS CALLING CARD,

202
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,217
THIS IS WHAT HE LEAVES
ALL HIS VICTIMS.

203
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,285
AND IT'S STILL WARM.

204
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,788
OKAY, GO AND ARREST HIM
AND SEND THIS TO THE LAB.

205
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,256
- WE DON'T HAVE A L-LAB.

206
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,758
- HI, APRIL.

207
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,261
OKAY, YOU'RE UNDERAGE.

208
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,262
- YOU'RE NOT.

209
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,732
- HEY.
YEAH, I'M GONNA LEAVE.

210
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:20,133
- OH, OKAY.

211
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,268
- THIS ISN'T THAT FUN.

212
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,103
- DIDN'T NEED
TO TELL ME THAT.

213
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,538
- I'M GONNA
TAKE THIS HOME.

214
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,173
NOBODY WAS DRINKING IT,
SO I'M GONNA TAKE IT.

215
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,174
- OKAY.

216
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:32,212
- GONNA TAKE THIS TOO.
BEEN MEANING TO READ IT.

217
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,981
- [sighs]

218
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,083
- OKAY, THIS ISN'T
STRICTLY LEGAL.

219
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,084
WE CONSULT HIM
FOR MAYBE AN HOUR,

220
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,085
AND THEN I GOT
TO LET HIM GO.

221
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,086
- YOU TALK TO HIM FIRST.

222
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,254
YOU HAVE A SCARY FACE.
- HEY.

223
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,290
- NO, IN A GOOD WAY.
SCARY CUTE.

224
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,092
- YEAH?
- GO TALK TO HIM.

225
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,093
- OKAY.

226
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,228
- I DIDN'T DO THIS, MAN.

227
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,097
I PROMISE.

228
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,633
- SON, I'M A POLICE OFFICER,
OKAY, YOU SHOULDN'T LIE TO ME.

229
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,302
- I'M NOT.
I'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE.

230
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:56,970
AND WHY WOULD I DO THIS?

231
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,172
- BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD RUN-INS
WITH MISS KNOPE IN THE PAST.

232
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,174
[cell phone rings]

233
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,143
JUST A SECOND.

234
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:07,214
YEAH?
- ASK HIM ABOUT THE PEACH PIT.

235
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,750
- THIS ISN'T
ONE-WAY GLASS, YOU KNOW.

236
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,152
I CAN SEE YOU.

237
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,821
YOU KNOW, I LIKE KNOPE.

238
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,989
I SCREW WITH HER
'CAUSE SHE GETS ALL RILED UP.

239
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,291
AND HER FACE GETS
ALL SCRUNCHED UP LIKE THIS.

240
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,761
BUT I LIKE HER.
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

241
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,296
[laughs]
YOU SEE?

242
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,297
- WHAT?

243
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:27,334
- I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY
DECORATING THIS PLACE,

244
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,369
AND EVERYBODY'S
IN THE KITCHEN.

245
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,371
WHY IS EVERYONE
ALWAYS IN THE KITCHEN?

246
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,673
- I THINK
IT'S GOING FINE.

247
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,341
- IT'S SO QUIET.

248
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,177
OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD.

249
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,280
THIS IS A TOTAL FAILURE.
THIS PARTY IS A FAILURE.

250
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,749
OH, MY GOD.

251
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,284
- NO, NO, IT'S NOT
A FAILURE, ANN, COME ON.

252
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,186
- ANN, DO YOU HAVE
ANY MOUNDS?

253
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,355
BECAUSE ALL I CAN FIND
ARE ALMOND JOYS.

254
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,758
AND ALMONDS
GIVE ME THE SQUIRTS.

255
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,759
- UGH.

256
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,160
- HEY, I'M HERE.

257
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,262
STATUE'S FINE.

258
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,898
"CRAPPY HALLOWIENERS."
THAT'S HILARIOUS.

259
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:58,999
WHERE'S THE KID?

260
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,067
- IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM,

261
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,902
TRYING TO HIDE
HIS OBVIOUS GUILT.

262
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,704
- LESLIE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

263
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:04,872
I DON'T THINK HE DID IT.

264
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,974
- YEAH, HE DID,
AND WE NEED A CONFESSION.

265
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:11,211
OKAY, ANDY AND I
ARE GOING TO TAKE A WALK.

266
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,848
AND IT'S GONNA BE JUST YOU,
PIKITIS, AND THESE PLIERS.

267
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,784
- LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA
TORTURE THIS KID.

268
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,019
- NOBODY SAID TORTURE.

269
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,654
- WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
TAKE A RUN AT HIM, BOSS?

270
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:24,224
IN ORDER TO THINK
LIKE ONE OF THESE GUYS,

271
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,093
YOU HAVE TO
THINK LIKE THEM.

272
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,161
- YEAH, HE'S NEVER
SEEN YOU BEFORE.

273
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:31,031
SO IMPLY THAT YOU'RE
SOMEONE VERY IMPORTANT,

274
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:34,902
AND THAT YOU CAN
MAKE HIS LIFE HELL.

275
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,037
- [clears throat]

276
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,106
GREG PIKITIS.

277
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,141
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME BOILING HOT COFFEE?

278
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:47,180
IN THE FACE?

279
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,348
- MY NAME
IS BERT MACKLIN.

280
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,952
I'M WITH THE [bleep] FBI.

281
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,087
- OOH. ARE THESE
THE SAME KIND OF CHIPS?

282
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:57,257
- HEY!
WHAT'S UP, GORGEOUS?

283
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,358
- PERFECT.

284
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,127
- GET YOUR RAGGEDY ASS
OVER HERE, GIRL.

285
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,095
- HEY, TOM. MAD HATTER?

286
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,797
- T-PAIN, BABY.

287
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:07,034
* SHE POPPIN', SHE ROLLIN',
SHE ROLLIN' *

288
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:11,839
* SHE CLIMBIN' THE POLE AND
I'M IN LOVE WITH THE STRIPPER *

289
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,874
THIS IS NOT A STRIPPER,
IT'S MY WIFE WENDY.

290
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,075
YOU REMEMBER HER.

291
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,076
- HI. THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR INVITING US.

292
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,210
- SURE.

293
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,946
- SHE'S A SURGEON
AT COUNTY GENERAL.

294
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,147
AND SHE'S SUPER HOT.

295
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,282
- WELL, THANK YOU
FOR BEING A DOCTOR

296
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:23,784
AND NOT COMING
DRESSED AS A DOCTOR.

297
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:28,221
- OH, MY GOD, WHO'D BE
BORING ENOUGH TO DO THAT?

298
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,222
- ANN,
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

299
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:30,758
DID YOU TELL EVERYONE
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO

300
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,826
GET A BONE MARROW
TRANSPLANT TOMORROW?

301
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,827
THEY LOOK MISERABLE.

302
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,262
THIS PARTY'S A DISASTER.

303
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,864
- NO, IT'S NOT.
- YES, IT IS.

304
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:37,865
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
WE CAN FIX THIS.

305
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:38,866
- TOTALLY.

306
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:39,933
- GIVE US A SECOND.

307
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,202
- YOU ARE THE STUPIDEST
HUMAN BEING I HAVE EVER--

308
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,370
- [sighs]
- SHUT UP!

309
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,838
- LOOKS LIKE ANDY'S
WEARING HIM DOWN.

310
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,040
I'M GONNA
GO FINISH HIM OFF.

311
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,409
- THAT IS THE DUMBEST THING
I HAVE EVER HEARD.

312
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,178
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SHUT UP FOR A SECOND?

313
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,312
- WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HERE?

314
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:56,216
- HE'S A JERK!
HE IS BEING SUCH A JERK!

315
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,317
THAT'S AN AWFUL THING
TO SAY TO A HUMAN BEING!

316
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,451
- ARE YOU CRYING?

317
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,020
- NO, I'M--
I AM NOT CRYING, OKAY?

318
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,856
I'M--I'M ALLERGIC TO JERKS!
- OKAY, ANDY, OUT.

319
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,160
- FINE! I DON'T EVEN CARE!
IT'S STUPID!

320
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:11,364
- OKAY.
THE GLOVES ARE COMING OFF.

321
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,334
- WH--WHAT'S THAT?
- I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

322
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,269
WHEN I CAME TO VISIT YOU
AT THE SCHOOL

323
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,438
YOU WERE EATING A PEACH.

324
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,540
THEN MY OFFICE
GETS VANDALIZED

325
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,075
AND SOMEBODY LEAVES
A PEACH PIT ON MY DESK.

326
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:25,478
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A COINCIDENCE, GREG.

327
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:26,746
- WOW. YOU NAILED ME.

328
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,250
I MEAN, THERE IS NO WAY THAT TWO
DIFFERENT PEOPLE COULD'VE EATEN

329
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:34,454
THE SAME FRUIT IN THE SAME DAY
IN THE SAME AREA OF INDIANA.

330
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,325
NEVER MIND THAT I WAS
ACTUALLY EATING A PLUM

331
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:44,264
WHEN YOU SAW ME EARLIER.

332
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,366
- I KNOW YOU DID THIS.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.

333
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,301
I DON'T CARE THAT YOU WERE
IN THE PARKING LOT ALL NIGHT,

334
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,203
SOMEHOW YOU FOUND
A WAY TO GET IN HERE.

335
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:51,905
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

336
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,173
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT I WAS
IN THE PARKING LOT ALL NIGHT?

337
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:57,044
- BECAUSE
I FOLLOWED YOU, GENIUS!

338
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,947
- IF YOU FOLLOWED ME ALL NIGHT,
THEN YOU KNOW THAT IT WASN'T ME!

339
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,149
NO! WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

340
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,218
- LOOK, I'VE BEEN VERY CIVIL,
BUT I WILL WATERBOARD YOU.

341
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,354
- NO, NOPE.

342
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,089
I DON'T THINK
SHE WOULD MAKE A GOOD COP.

343
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,558

KEEP IT A SECRET MUCH LONGER

00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,947
- WHENEVER HE GETS IN TROUBLE
HE GOES ON CRAIGSLIST

516
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,849
AND HIRES A WOMAN TO PLAY
HIS MOTHER AND BAIL HIM OUT.

517
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:46,253
OH, THAT LITTLE S-O-B.

518
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,921
GREG! GREGORY!

519
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:49,922
- I KNEW IT!

520
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,658
- OH, MY GOD.
- DUDE.

521
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:56,396
THAT KID IS AMAZING.

522
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,932
- HE'S NOT IN HIS ROOM.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

523
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,368
- I DO.

524
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,603
- MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT.

525
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,639
- HEY!

526
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,508
- LET THEM GO!
STAY ON THE LEADER!

527
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,578
[panting]

528
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:12,579
- OOH...

529
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,714
I AM GONNA
WRING YOUR NECK!

530
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,549
- HOW DID YOU GET
INTO THE PARKS DEPARTMENT?

531
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,350
I HAVE TO KNOW.

532
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,851
- MAYBE THE FBI
CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

533
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:22,689
- [laughs]
I'M NOT EVEN IN THE FBI, STUPID.

534
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,724
- WOW. YOU'RE AMAZING.

535
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,293
- HEY! YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

536
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,394
- YOU CAN'T--

537
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,094
- HE'S NOT GONNA GO TO JAIL,
YOU KNOW, HE'S A MINOR.

538
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,563
- WE'LL LET
THE JURY DECIDE.

539
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,565
- IT'S NOT GONNA BE A JURY,
IT'S HIS--

540
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,566
- THEN THE JUDGE WILL
DECIDE WHERE HE GOES.

541
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,502
- LOOK, HE'S GONNA DO PROBATION,
HE'S A MINOR--

542
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,504
- DAVE,
JUST LET ME HAVE THIS.

543
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,508
- WOW, NICE WORK, KNOPE.
- YEAH, THAT IS AMAZING.

544
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,709
- THANKS.

545
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,645
BUT THE THING THAT'S DRIVING ME
NUTS IS HOW DID HE DO IT?

546
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,582
- IF YOU DESTROY HIM EARLY,
PLEASE COME BY.

547
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,284
- I WILL.

548
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:52,619
- HOW IS SOMEONE GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET THROUGH THAT DOOR?

549
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,721
- OH! WHAT THE--

550
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,623
- I MEAN, WE WERE HERE
ALL AFTERNOON.

551
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:59,626
HOW DID HE GET IN?

552
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:02,962
FIRST OF ALL, WE ALWAYS
LOCK THE DOORS WHEN WE LEAVE.

553
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,864
AND DAVE AND I
TAILED PIKITIS

554
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,767
FROM THE MOMENT
HE LEFT HIS HOUSE AT 7:00 P.M.

555
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,670
TO THE MOMENT
WE CAME BACK HERE.

556
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,339
DOES HE HAVE
A LOOK-ALIKE OR SOMETHING?

557
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:18,311
DID HE HAVE AN ACCOMPLICE?
I MEAN, DID HE HAVE HELP?

558
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:21,981
HOW DID THAT
LITTLE TURD DO IT?

559
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:22,081
