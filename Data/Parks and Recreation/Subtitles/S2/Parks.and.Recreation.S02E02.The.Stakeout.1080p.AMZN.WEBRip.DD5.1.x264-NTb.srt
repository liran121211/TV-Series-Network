1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,171
- I JUST WANT TO CHECK

2
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:05,406
ONE LAST TIME
THAT YOU'RE OKAY

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:06,774
ABOUT THIS DATE
WITH MARK.

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,542
- OH, MY GOD, I AM SO FINE
WITH IT, ANN, SERIOUSLY.

5
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:09,710
IT'S SO FINE.

6
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,512
AS LONG AS YOU AND I
ARE COOL.

7
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,247
YOU KNOW MY CODE.

8
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:14,548
HOS BEFORE BROS.

9
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:16,784
UTERUSES BEFORE DUDERUSES.
- GOT IT.

10
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,619
- OVARIES BEFORE BROVARIES.

11
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,421
MM.

12
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,091
YOU MAKE SUCH GOOD COFFEE.

13
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,725
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'RE OKAY WITH IT,

14
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,127
BUT I'VE BEEN
IN THIS POSITION BEFORE.

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,695
AND I HAD A FRIEND
WHO DATED AN EX,

16
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,698
AND I SAID I WAS OKAY,
BUT I WASN'T ACTUALLY.

17
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,799
IT WAS KIND OF WEIRD.

18
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,701
- THE THING IS,
MARK ISN'T MY EX.

19
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,603
YOU KNOW, WE SLEPT TOGETHER
SIX YEARS AGO.

20
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,105
ANYWAY, I'M OVER IT.

21
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:38,672
OR AM I?
I'M JUST KIDDING.

22
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:39,673
- OH.

23
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,644
- OH. OH.

24
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,779
THIS IS ONE
OF MY GREATEST BRAINSTORMS EVER.

25
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:46,580
A COMMUNITY GARDEN.

26
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,716
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE PIT.

27
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,718
WE'RE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE
TO JUST COME OUT

28
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,253
AND PLANT WHATEVER THEY WANT.

29
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,788
AND TOM AND I SOMETIMES
GET HERE EARLY AND HELP OUT.

30
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,257
- IT'S SO HOT.

31
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,791
I HAD TO GET
SOME MORE ICED TEA.

32
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:00,428
- PEOPLE HAVE
JUST REALLY EMBRACED THIS

33
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:01,729
AND PLANTED THE COOLEST STUFF.

34
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,697
AND TOM IS
OUR MASTER HORTICULTURIST.

35
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,466
HE KNOWS ALL THE SCIENTIFIC
NAMES FOR EVERYTHING.

36
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,700
RIGHT, TOM?
- YUP.

37
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,469
- LIKE THIS.
WHAT'S THIS, TOM?

38
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,204
- THOSE ARE, OF COURSE,
TOMATOES.

39
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:12,140
OR SOULJABOY TELLEMS.

40
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,375
WHENEVER LESLIE ASKS ME
FOR THE LATIN NAMES

41
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,609
OF ANY OF OUR PLANTS,

42
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,745
I JUST GIVE HER THE NAMES
OF RAPPERS.

43
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:18,646
- AND THOSE OVER THERE?

44
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,648
- THOSE ARE SOME DIDDIES.

45
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,684
THERE'S SOME BONETHUGS
AND HARMONIUMS RIGHT HERE.

46
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:24,885
- GROWING BEAUTIFULLY.

47
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,554
- THOSE LUDACRISES
ARE COMING IN GREAT.

48
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,821
- LOOK. SOMEONE PLANTED
SOMETHING NEW.

49
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,490
WHAT'S THIS?

50
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:30,591
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
CARROTS?

51
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:35,663
IF THAT'S TRUE, WE HAVE
A GARDEN PEST ON OUR HANDS.

52
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,598
MAYBE SOME KIND OF SPICE?

53
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,300
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, LESLIE,
THE BEST WAY TO FIGURE OUT

54
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,234
WHAT KIND OF SPICE THAT IS,

55
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,770
IS ROLL IT UP INTO A JOINT
AND SMOKE IT.

56
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,708
[triumphant music]

57
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:55,749

[footsteps]

59
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,229
- RON, DID YOU GET MY TEXT?

60
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,164
- NO.
- DID YOU GET MY EMAILS?

61
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:11,232
- MM-MM.

62
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,800
- DID YOU SEE
THAT I PAGED YOU?

63
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,168
- I DID NOT.

64
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:16,637
- DID YOU CHECK
YOUR VOICEMAIL?

65
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,905
- I DIDN'T.

66
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,039
- WE HAVE A CRIMINAL EMERGENCY
ON OUR HANDS.

67
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,809
SOMEONE PLANTED A GATEWAY DRUG
IN THE COMMUNITY GARDEN.

68
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,677
- OKAY.
CALL THE COPS.

69
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:24,745
- THAT'LL LEAK TO THE PRESS.

70
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,814
THEN THERE'LL BE
AN INVESTIGATION.

71
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,582
AND THEY'LL FIND
MY FINGERPRINTS ON THE MANURE.

72
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,683
AND THEN WE'LL LOSE
OUR FUNDING.

73
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:30,918
- YOU DON'T HAVE FUNDING.

74
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,654
- AND WE NEVER WILL
IF THIS GETS OUT.

75
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:34,888
LOOK, I WILL CALL THE COPS,

76
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,325
BUT JUST GIVE ME ONE DAY TO DEAL
WITH THIS INTERNALLY, OKAY?

77
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,260
- SURE.
- THANK YOU.

78
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,463
AND LISTEN,
IF THIS THING BLOWS UP,

79
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,866
I WAS NEVER HERE.

80
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,235
- OKAY.

81
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,337
[footsteps]

82
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,272
I HAVE A HERNIA.

83
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,774
I'VE HAD IT FOR A WHILE.

84
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,810
AND I'VE BEEN IGNORING IT...

85
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,513
SUCCESSFULLY,
BUT THIS MORNING,

86
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:02,850
I MADE THE MISTAKE
OF SNEEZING.

87
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,586
[sneezes]

[howls]

89
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,489
BUT AS LONG AS I SIT STILL

90
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,392
AND DON'T MOVE MY HEAD

91
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,562
OR TORSO,

92
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,764
I'M GOOD, I GOT THIS.

93
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,366
- WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO WE'RE DEALING WITH.

94
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,634
WHO IS THIS PERSON?
WHO IS THIS KINGPIN?

95
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:23,671
- IT'S A 13-YEAR-OLD KID
NAMED STEVIE

96
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,307
WHO LIKES TO GET HIGH AND MAKE
HIS TRANSFORMERS LOOK

97
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,241
LIKE THEY'RE HAVING SEX
TOGETHER.

98
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,410
- I WOULD LIKE TO BE PRESIDENT
SOME DAY,

99
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,579
SO, NO,
I HAVE NOT SMOKED MARIJUANA.

100
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:34,782
I ATE A BROWNIE ONCE.

101
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:35,883
AT A PARTY IN COLLEGE.

102
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,718
IT WAS INTENSE.

103
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,987
IT WAS KIND OF INDESCRIBABLE,
ACTUALLY.

104
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,755
I FELT LIKE I WAS FLOATING.

105
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,325
TURNS OUT THERE WASN'T ANY POT
IN THE BROWNIE.

106
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,660
IT WAS JUST
AN INSANELY GOOD BROWNIE.

107
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:49,897
YOU KNOW, IF WE CATCH HIM,
THEN WE AVOID A SCANDAL.

108
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,565
'CAUSE WE FLIP THE HEADLINE.

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,967
AND IT'S NOT "COMMUNITY GARDEN
INFESTED WITH POT,"

110
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,869
IT'S "BRAVE PUBLIC SERVANTS

EARN PRAISE FROM MAYOR,
COMMA, EVERYONE."

00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,709
WE GOTTA CATCH THIS GUY.

114
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:05,646
GET THE VAN,
MEET ME AT 7:00.

115
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,481
IT'S STAKEOUT TIME.

116
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,383
- APRIL.

117
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,385
- YEAH?

118
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,321

00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:14,888
- OKAY, LIKE ORDER YOU
SOMETHING?

120
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:19,059
- NO, GET IT FROM THERE.

121
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,395
- IS THIS SOME KIND
OF WEIRD POWER TRIP?

122
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,297
- PLEASE.

123
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,639
THANK YOU.
THAT'LL BE ALL.

124
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,674
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

125
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,687
- I HAVE STAKEOUT SUPPLIES.

126
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,756
THIS IS STUFF
THAT WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA NEED.

127
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,793
WE HAVE NOTEPADS,
PENCILS, AND PENCIL CASE.

128
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,863
SHAKABLE WHIPPED CREAM.
CAMERAS.

UM, GORP.

UH, AND...

131
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,702
CANDY NECKLACES.

132
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,671
IT'S LIKE WE'RE REAL POLICE.

133
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:07,508
AND I MADE US
A MIX CD.

134
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,711
IT'S ALL FILLED WITH SONGS
ABOUT PEOPLE WATCHING PEOPLE.

135
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,446
IT'S MOSTLY STING.

136
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,714
AND LOOK, I PUT OUR FACES
ON THERE.

137
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,048
- IT'S REALLY COOL.

138
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,717
- ARE YOU GONNA WEAR
THAT SHIRT?

139
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,786
- YEAH. YOU LIKE IT?

140
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,987
- TOMMY HILFIGER?

141
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,422
- NO, TOM HAVERFORD.

142
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:22,523
I SPENT 120 BUCKS
TO GET IT MONOGRAMMED.

143
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:23,724
- OKAY, HERE YOU GO.

144
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,925
- EVERYONE THINKS
IT'S TOMMY HILFIGER.

145
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,494
- WELL, HERE, YOU SHOULD BE
WEARING SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

146
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,761
TAKE THIS.

147
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:28,629
WEAR BLACK.
- DO I HAVE TO?

148
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,997
- BLACK IS WHAT YOU WEAR
IN A STAKEOUT.

149
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,799
OKAY, I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW THIS WORKS.

150
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,534
- JUST LET ME FOCUS UP
ON THIS.

151
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,835
- PRETTY BUMMED
THIS FITS.

152
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,104
- OKAY, NOW WE JUST NEED
TO TAKE A TEST SHOT

153
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,472
AND SEE HOW THIS GOES.

154
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,640
- YEAH, TAKE A TEST SHOT.
YOU READY?

155
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,908
JUST FOCUS UP ON THE PIT.

156
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:41,742
ALL RIGHT.
- STOP.

157
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,844
- FOCUS UP RIGHT WHERE THE--

158
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,413
- FOCUS UP RIGHT
WHERE THE WEED--

159
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:46,780
- STOP.
STOP.

160
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,850
- LESLIE SWEARS IT'S OKAY.

161
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,785
SO I'M GOING OUT
WITH MARK.

162
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,020
I GOT TO GET BACK OUT THERE.

163
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,589
WHEN ANDY AND I USED
TO GO TO THE MOVIES,

164
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:58,492
HE WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO GUESS
THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE.

165
00:05:58,526 --> 00:05:59,893
AND HE WOULD ALWAYS GUESS

166
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:03,997
THAT THE MAIN CHARACTER
HAD BEEN DEAD THE WHOLE TIME.

167
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,500
EVEN WHEN WE SAW RATATOUILLE.

168
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,704
[door slams]

169
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,906
- OH, LOOK, IT'S MARK.

170

[shutter snapping]

171
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:16,777
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

172
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,680
- WHAT? I'M JUST CHECKING
TO MAKE SURE THIS LENS WORKS.

173
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,714
GOOD. YEAH.

174
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,720
- HEY. ANN.

175
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:27,721
- SO ARE YOU READY TO GO?

176
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:31,492
- OH, NO, I NEED ANOTHER HOUR
TO GET READY.

177
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,727
- SERIOUSLY? 'CAUSE I THINK
THE MOVIE STARTS IN LIKE...

00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:36,697
OH, YOU'RE--YOU'RE JOKING AROUND

179
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,633
- WOW, THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

180
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,502
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
WITH A BODY LIKE THIS,

181
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,837
YOU DON'T GET THE BRAINS TOO.

182
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,839
- EW.
- THAT WAS SILLY.

183
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,741
[shutter snapping]

184
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:48,776
- WHOA, ARE THEY DATING NOW?

185
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,811
BRENDANAWICZ IS THE MAN.

186
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,546
THIS IS BRENDANAWICZ'S LIFE:

187
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,881
HOT CHICK FROM THE NEWSPAPER,

188
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,716
HOT CHICK FROM THE POST OFFICE,

189
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,950
HOT CHICK FROM THE HOSPITAL.

00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,185
- HER NAME'S ANN.
YOU KNOW HER NAME.

191
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,587
HER NAME'S ANN.

192
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,455
- I'M JUST SAYING,
NOBODY TURNS HIM DOWN.

193
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:02,856
- I DID.

194
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,725

YEAH.

195
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,593
- YEAH, I DID.

196
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,795
- WE WERE DRUNK,
AND HE TRIED TO KISS ME,

197
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:11,799
AND I SAID, "NUH-UH,
NO, SIR, MARK BRENDANAWICZ.

198
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,867
I DON'T NEED
YOUR BUSINESS HERE."

199
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:17,805
GET DOWN!
[shutter snapping]

200
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,876
[vacuum whirs]

201
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,183
- WORKING LATE?

202
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,820
- YUP.

203
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,966
- [vocalizes]

204
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,167
* SHOVEL GUITAR

205
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,068
* SHOVEL GUITAR

206
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,704
* SOMEBODY WANTS
TO PLAY SHOVEL GUITAR *

207
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:55,142
- LESLIE'S BEEN PLAYING SHOVEL
GUITAR FOR ABOUT AN HOUR NOW.

208
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,977
- * BUCKET DRUM

209
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,579
* BUCKET DRUM

210
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,847
YOU'RE NOT FROM HERE, RIGHT?

211
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,848
- NO, I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA.

212
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,750
- BUT YOU MOVED
TO SOUTH CAROLINA FROM WHERE?

213
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,785
- MY MOTHER'S UTERUS.

214
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,954
- BUT YOU WERE CONCEIVED
IN LIBYA, RIGHT?

215
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,622
- WOW. NO.

216
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:09,723
- I WAS CONCEIVED
IN AMERICA.

217
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:10,658
MY PARENTS ARE INDIAN.

218
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,860
- WHERE DID THE NAME HAVERFORD
COME FROM?

219
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:17,531
- MY BIRTH NAME IS
DARWISH ZUBAIR ISMAIL GANI.

220
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:18,899
THEN I CHANGED IT
TO TOM HAVERFORD

221
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,535
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
BROWN GUYS

222
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:22,603
WITH FUNNY-SOUNDING MUSLIM NAMES

223
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,706
DON'T MAKE IT REALLY FAR
IN POLITICS.

224
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:26,774
- WHAT ABOUT BARACK OBAMA?

225
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,208
- OKAY, YEAH, FINE,
BARACK OBAMA.

226
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,811
IF I KNEW A DUDE
NAMED BARACK OBAMA

227
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,012
WAS GONNA BE ELECTED PRESIDENT,

228
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,614
YEAH, MAYBE
I WOULDN'T HAVE CHANGED IT.

229
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:34,615
- DID YOU HEAR THAT NOISE?

230
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,584
OH, MY GOD, IT'S THE KINGPIN.

231
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,652
WRITE THIS DOWN.

232
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,624
OKAY, WHITE MALE,
LIGHT BROWN HAIR.

233
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,192
- JUST TAKE PICTURES.

234
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,894
- OH, MY GOD.
IT LOOKS LIKE ANDY.

235
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,096
- THAT IS ANDY.

236
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,698
- THAT IS ANDY.

237
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,733
ANDY IS THE KINGPIN.

238
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,838
- ANDY, COME HERE.
- OH, HEY, YOU GUYS.

239
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,106
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

240
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,007
- SHH.
- IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

241
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,709
- QUIETLY.
- [whispers] WHAT HAPPENED?

242
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,611
- YOU'RE LIVING IN THE PIT NOW?

243
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:04,878
- FOR NOW, YEAH.
IT'S AWESOME.

244
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,914
SOMEBODY JUST PLANTED A GARDEN
DOWN THERE

245
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,716
WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, SO
I'M GETTING A LOT OF VITAMINS.

246
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,884
- YEAH, THAT'S
OUR COMMUNITY GARDEN.

247
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:14,688
- YEAH, AND SOMEONE PLANTED
A WHOLE MESS OF WEED

248
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,689
NEXT TO THE TOMATOES.

249
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:16,657
- OH, DON'T LOOK AT ME.

250
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,258
THERE'S WEED DOWN THERE?

251
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,760
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE TOPS
OF CARROTS.

252
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,663
- RIGHT, I KNOW. LISTEN,
WE'RE ON A STAKEOUT, OKAY?

253
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,997
SO WHY DON'T YOU COME TO THE VAN
AND HELP US?

254
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,198
WE'RE TRYING TO CATCH THE GUY.

255
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,299
MAYBE YOU CAN TELL US
WHAT YOU'VE SEEN.

256
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,801
- I'M SUPPOSED
TO HAVE A ROCK FIGHT

257
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,069
WITH THIS CRAZY GUY.

258
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,706
HE'S LIKE 20 MINUTES LATE.
ALL RIGHT.

259
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,707
LET'S DO IT.
- OKAY.

260
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:38,345
- DO YOU LIVE HERE?

261
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,013
- APRIL?

262
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,749
- YEAH, DO YOU LIVE HERE?

263
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:42,883
- NO.

264
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,720
- CATCH.

265
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,088
YEAH, I THOUGHT SO.

266
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:51,324
I WENT HOME,
BUT I HAD THIS STRANGE FEELING

267
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:52,626
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOU,

268
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,727
SO I CAME BACK.

269
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,229
- IT'S JUST
A MINOR MEDICAL ISSUE.

270
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,831
- AIDS?

271
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,032
- NO, I'M SAFE.

272
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,033
- BLINDNESS?

273
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,735
- NO.

274
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,170
- IS IT LIKE A PARASITE
OR A VIRUS OR SOMETHING

275
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,171
YOU GET FROM A BEE?

276
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,674
- I HAVE A HERNIA.

277
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:07,741
- DO YOU HAVE SYPHILIS?

278
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,409
- I SAID IT'S A HERNIA.

279
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,245
- I KNOW. IT'S POSSIBLE
TO HAVE TWO THINGS.

280
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,982
DO YOU NEED A RIDE
TO THE HOSPITAL?

281
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:15,983
- YES, PLEASE.

282
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,418
- OKAY,
BUT I RODE MY BIKE HERE,

283
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,187
SO I HAVE TO GO HOME
AND GET MY DAD'S STATION WAGON.

284
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,255
- THANK YOU.

285
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,092
- BYE.

286
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,996
[footsteps]

287
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,063
- YOU STILL HERE?

288
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,766
- YEAH. I JUST WANTED
TO SEE IF YOU COULD TELL.

289
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,709
- ARE YOU STILL HERE?

290
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,177
- IT IS REALLY GREAT
TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO TALK TO.

291
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,345
MAN, OH, MAN.

OH, I MISS HER SO MUCH,
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

294
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:50,884

298
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,260
OH, I'M GONNA NEED MORE OF THESE

299
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,729
- IS THAT CANDY?

300
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:02,462
- YEAH, IT'S A NECKLACE
MADE OUT OF CANDY.

301
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,265
WANT ONE?
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

302
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,935

303
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,169

307
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:19,813
- NOT IN THIS ONE.

308
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:24,284
INSTANT SUGAR HIGH.
SUGAR HIGH. SUGAR HIT HIGH.

309
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,419
SUGAR HIGH. HIGH.

310
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,822
OH, WOW. MM.

00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:32,092
- WHOO-HOO-HOO.
SUGAR SLAM.

312
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,093
- MAYBE WE SHOULD GET YOU
SOMETHING

313
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,427
MORE SUBSTANTIAL TO EAT.

314
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:35,963
- MM-HMM.
I'M IN.

315
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:40,267
- HEY, BRING ME BACK TWO
CHEESEBURGERS AND A GREEN TEA.

316
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:48,275
OH, COME ON.
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

317
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,412

00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,748
- YEAH, IT REALLY WAS.

319
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:55,482

320
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,984
- UH, YOU KNOW WHAT,

321
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,853
I HAVE BEEN A PERFECT GENTLEMAN

322
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,755
IN FACT, WATCH THIS.

323
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:04,391
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO NOW PLEASE
INVITE ME IN FOR A NIGHTCAP.

324
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:05,458

00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,833
- YES, I WILL.

330
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,101
NO, NO, DAMN.

331
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,503
DRATS, I WAS GONNA PLAN
TO NOT.

332
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,172
- W-W-WAIT. LOOK.

333
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:22,309
THAT GUY'S TRYING TO BREAK
INTO THAT VAN.

334
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,476
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT DOES LOOK

335
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,477
LIKE HE'S BREAKING
INTO THAT VAN.

336
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,180
[dialing]
- WHOO!

337
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,249

338
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:32,385

339
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,787
FROM THE PIT?

340
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,456
- NO. NO.

341
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,858
I JUST LIKE BEING NEARBY.

342
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,293
THAT WAY IF SHE WANTS ME BACK,

343
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,162
I COULD BE AT HER HOUSE, LIKE,
IN TWO SECONDS

344
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,798
BEFORE SHE CHANGES HER MIND.

345
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:46,834
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW
HOW HEALTHY THAT IS.

346
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,069
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
AREN'T EVEN DATING ANYMORE.

347
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,470
SHE MIGHT BE DATING
SOMEBODY ELSE.

348
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:54,007
- IS SHE?
- WHAT?

349
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,809
- IS SHE DATING SOMEBODY ELSE?
- HUH? WHAT?

350
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:57,377
- YOU JUST SAID ANN MIGHT BE
DATING SOMEBODY ELSE. IS SHE?

351
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,946
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- WHO IS SHE DATING?

352
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,380
- NOBODY. MARK.

353
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,016
- THAT'S COOL.

354
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,517
OH, MY GOD!

355
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:08,822
- 641 TO BASE.
I'M AT THE VEHICLE NOW.

356
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,428
HOW ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT,
SIR?

357
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,597
- I'M ALL RIGHT, OFFICER.
HOW ARE YOU?

358
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,066
- I'M RESPONDING TO A 911 CALL

359
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,902
ABOUT A SUSPICIOUS PERSON
BREAKING INTO A VAN.

360
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,171
I NEED YOU TO STEP OUT
AND SHOW ME SOME I.D.

361
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,306
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
MY NAME'S TOM HAVERFORD.

362
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,574
I WORK FOR THE PARKS DEPARTMENT.

363
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,009
I JUST GOT LOCKED
OUT OF THE VAN.

364
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,343
I HAD TO JIMMY MY WAY BACK IN.

365
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,912
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JIMMY
YOUR WAY OUT

366
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:32,745
AND SHOW ME SOME I.D.?

367
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,615
- UM, WELL,
I JUST TOLD YOU MY I.D.,

368
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,850
SO WHAT'S THE CRIME HERE?

369
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,551
PARKING WHILE INDIAN?

370
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,187
- NO, THERE'S NO STEREOTYPES

371
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,255
ABOUT INDIANS
SITTING IN VEHICLES.

372
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:47,427
- ALL RIGHT, FINE,
HERE'S MY I.D.

373
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,295
NICE JOB, PAUL BLART.

374
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,163
WHY DON'T YOU HEAD
BACK TO THE MALL,

375
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,465
MAKE SURE NOBODY'S BREAKING
INTO LADY FOOT LOCKER?

376
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,602
- HEY, I'M VERY CLOSE RIGHT NOW
TO PLACING YOU UNDER ARREST

377
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:56,469
FOR DISORDERLY CONDUCT.

378
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,105
STEP OUT OF THE VAN.

379
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,639
- I'LL STEP OUT
OF YOUR MAMA'S VAN.

380
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,208
[screams]

381
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,475
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

382
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,111
I'M A CITY EMPLOYEE, MAN.
COME ON!

383
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,412
- CALM DOWN.
- LESLIE!

384
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,086
- MOTION SENSORS.

385
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,523
- OH, MY GOD.

386
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,558
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

387
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,193
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GUY
THAT WAS IN THAT VAN?

388
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,995
- COPS TOOK HIM.

389
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,230
- WHAT?

390
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:24,464
OH, MY GOD.
- ANN AND MARK!

391
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,233
- ANDY.

392
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,500
- IT'S ANN AND MARK.

393
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,369
- ANDY.
- LESLIE?

394
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,637
- OH.
- LESLIE KNOPE.

395
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,005
- HEY.
- HEY.

396
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,007
- WOW.
- WE CAUGHT A CRIMINAL.

397
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:34,874
DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

398
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,643
- YEAH, HE WAS BREAKING
INTO THIS VAN,

399
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:39,146
AND THEY DRAGGED HIM AWAY.

400
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,982
IT WAS CRAZY.
- RIGHT HERE.

401
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,450
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

402
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,223
- IF YOU COULD JUST STOP WRITING
FOR A SECOND

403
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,124
AND JUST FOCUS HERE,
'CAUSE--

404
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,559
- MA'AM, MA'AM,

405
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,327
AS I'VE TOLD YOU
SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY,

406
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:55,662
THIS IS A POLICE MATTER.

407
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:59,132
- WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO MATTER TO THE POLICE.

408
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,668
- OKAY, NICE JOB
WITH THAT, BUT LISTEN--

409
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,203
- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

410
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,138
IS IT THE POLICY
OF THE PAWNEE POLICE DEPARTMENT

411
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,240
TO ARREST PEOPLE WHEN THEY TRY
TO GET INTO THEIR OWN VAN?

412
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,508
- NO.

413
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,243
AND, THANKFULLY,
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

414
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,644
SO NOW COULD YOU PLEASE
GO HOME

415
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,246
AND GET SOME SLEEP
AND LET THIS MATTER BE RESOLVED?

416
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,682
- THANK YOU, OFFICER.
LET'S JUST GO HOME, LESLIE.

417
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,217
- YEAH, LET'S GO HOME.
- LET'S JUST GO HOME.

418
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,285
- NO!
- LET'S JUST GO HOME.

419
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:21,221
- NO!

420
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,255
- EASY.

421
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,523
- NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!
- LESLIE.

422
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,657
- OKAY, COME WITH ME, PLEASE.

423
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:25,492
- FINE, I'D LIKE
TO COME WITH YOU.

424
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,360
- YOUR FRIEND, HE ACTED
LIKE AN ASS,

425
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,096
AND YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME,
HE DIDN'T GIVE ME A CHOICE.

426
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,330
- YOUR NAME'S DAVE, RIGHT?

427
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,364
CAN I CALL YOU DAVE?

428
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,967
- MY MOTHER LIKES DAVID,

429
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,202
BUT I'M PRETTY SPLIT ON--

430
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,037
- I HATE TO BREAK IT
TO YOU, DAVE.

431
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,271
YOU REALLY STEPPED IN IT.

432
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:39,106
- WHAT?

433
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,274
- I'M A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE,
DAVID.

434
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:42,142
AND SO IS YOUR PRISONER.

435
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,544
IF I WANTED TO,
I COULD GET ON THE HORN,

436
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,147
AND I COULD HAVE RON SWANSON
DOWN HERE,

437
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,381
KICKING DOWN YOUR DOORS.

438
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,183
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HEARD ME.

439
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:51,451
RON SWANSON.

440
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:57,057
- WHAT BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT
ARE YOU IN?

441
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:00,627
- PARKS AND RECREATION.

442
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,429
- PARKS AND RECREATION?
- YES.

443
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,564
DO I STUTTER?

444
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:07,100
- LOOK, MISS KNOPE,

445
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,169
IT WASN'T JUST HIS BEHAVIOR,
OKAY?

446
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,271
I THINK YOUR FRIEND MIGHT BE
SOME KIND OF A PERVERT.

447
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,740
- NO, LOOK, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
THINK WHEN THEY FIRST MEET HIM

448
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,442
BUT HE'S ALL TALK.

449
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,476
- NO, NO, NO,
I'M BEING SERIOUS.

450
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,410
WE SEARCHED THE VAN,

451
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,179
AND WE FOUND A LOT
OF DISTURBING THINGS.

452
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,581
SOME PROFESSIONAL
PHOTOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT

453
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:24,151
AND THESE PICTURES
OF SOME PEOPLE ON A DATE.

454
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:27,254
WE ALSO FOUND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT
OF MANURE

455
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,057
AND A VERY INAPPROPRIATE AMOUNT
OF CANDY.

456
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,793
- OKAY, LOOK, TOM AND I WERE
IN THAT VAN TOGETHER.

457
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,462
WE WERE STAKING OUT
THE COMMUNITY GARDEN

458
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,364
BECAUSE SOMEBODY
PLANTED MARIJUANA IN IT.

459
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,266
I BROUGHT THE CANDY,
AND I BROUGHT A LOT OF IT

460
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,733
BECAUSE I LOVE CANDY.

461
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,236
I TOOK THE PICTURES.

462
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,073
MY BEST FRIEND WAS GOING
ON A DATE WITH MY EX-LOVER.

463
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,775
IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG NIGHT.

464
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,143
BUT TOM IS NOT A PERVERT,

465
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,544
AND HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL.

466
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,215
WELL,
THEY'RE GONNA RELEASE HIM.

467
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,283
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

468
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,451
- OH, THANK GOD.

469
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,487
- SHOULD I GET YOU GUYS HOME
RIGHT NOW?

470
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,821
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU TWO GO AHEAD.

471
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,256
I'M GONNA STAY HERE
AND WAIT FOR TOM.

472
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,357
- ARE YOU SURE?

473
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,825
- YEAH.

474
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,627
PRISON CHANGES A MAN.

475
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,362
I THINK HE'LL PROBABLY WANT
TO SEE A FAMILIAR FACE

476
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:10,530
WHEN HE GETS BACK
ON THE OUTSIDE.

477
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,798
- WELL, OKAY, THEN.

478
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:16,669
SEE YOU, LESLIE.

479
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,338
- [groans]

480
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,143
- YO. I HAD TO WAIT
TILL MY DAD FELL ASLEEP

481
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,378
SO I COULD STEAL HIS KEYS.

482
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,379
YOU READY?

483
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:31,251
- I WAS BORN READY.

484
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,220
I'M RON [bleep] SWANSON.

485
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,457
EASY. CARE--
[moans]

486
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,359
CAREFUL.

487
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,661
[pants]

488
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,297
[shouts]

489
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,200
- ANN, I REALLY DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD INVITE ME IN.

490
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,436
TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPENED
LAST TIME.

491
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,571
- [laughs]

492
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,207
- SO I GUESS I'LL JUST...

493
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,542
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
- OKAY.

494
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,245
- OKAY.

495
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:02,382
- BYE.

496
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,317
- HEY, YOU KIND OF KISSED ME.

497
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:07,287
- YES, I DID,
AND NOW WE BOTH HAVE HERPES.

498
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,289
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- [laughs]

499
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,324
[rustling]

500
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,795
[car door shuts]

501
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,305
- LESLIE.
THANKS FOR WAITING.

502
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,906
APPRECIATE IT.
- MOTHER TERESA.

503
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,643
IT'S NOT YOUR CHOCOLATE.
DON'T--GET YOUR HANDS OFF THAT.

504
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:33,213
- WAKE UP.
- WHAT?

505
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,581
IS THIS YOUR HOUSE?
WHERE ARE WE?

506
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,882
- HEY, YOU'RE AWAKE.

507
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,917
- OH, YEAH.

508
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,287
THANKS FOR THE COAT.

509
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,621
- IT'S NO PROBLEM.
YOU CAN KEEP IT.

510
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:42,655
- REALLY?

511
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,524
- ACTUALLY, NO.

512
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,693
I-I NEED THAT
FOR MY UNIFORM.

513
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,162
BUT I CAN GIVE YOU A RIDE
BACK TO YOUR CAR.

514
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:50,197
- OKAY.

515
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,831
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE COAT.

516
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,566
- I CAN'T GIVE IT TO YOU.

517
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,667
YOU UNDERSTAND?
- OKAY.

518
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:59,306
- SO WHERE'S THAT MARIJUANA AT?

519
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,740
- UM, IT'S DOWN
IN THE GARDEN.

520
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,209
- GOOD MEETING YOU, MAN.

521
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:05,845
SHOULD GRAB A DRINK OR SOMETHING
SOME TIME.

522
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,480
- I JUST HOPE THAT ANN AND MARK
GOT HOME OKAY.

523
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:08,881
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS,
YOU KNOW.

524
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,284
THAT ANN IS HOME,
AND SHE'S OKAY.

525
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,953
AND THAT MARK IS ALSO OKAY,
AND HE IS IN HIS HOME.

526
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,955
JUST IMPORTANT THAT
THEY'RE BOTH

527
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,190
IN THEIR HOMES.
- LESLIE!

528
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,558
MARK'S AN IDIOT.

529
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,959
YOU COULD DO A LOT BETTER
THAN HIM.

530
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,961
FORGET ABOUT HIM.

531
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,964
THANKS, TOM.

532
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,733
- I DIDN'T MEAN ME.

533
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,568
KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS,
KNOPE.

534
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,272
I SWEAR TO GOD,
IT ACTUALLY--IT WAS THERE.

535
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,475
- THESE ARE CARROTS.
- DUH.

536
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,210
YOU DON'T THINK
I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

537
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,812
BETWEEN CARROTS AND MARIJUANA?

538
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,783
- IS THAT THE HOUSE THERE
WHERE YOUR BEST FRIEND LIVES?

539
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:47,487
WHERE SHE SAW THE VAN FROM?
- YEAH.

540
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,555
- OKAY, I GET IT.

541
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:49,856
- WHAT?

542
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,524
- WELL, YOU WANTED TO CHECK UP
ON YOUR FRIEND

543
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,326
AND THAT GUY,
YOUR EX,

544
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,928
SO YOU MADE UP A STORY
ABOUT WEED

545
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,330
SO YOU COULD STAKE OUT
THEIR DATE.

546
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,631
- NO, I DID NOT.

547
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,633
THERE ACTUALLY WAS WEED HERE.
- IT'S OKAY.

548
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,504
I THINK
IT'S KIND OF CUTE.

549
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,008
I LIKE MISS KNOPE.
I LIKED HER.

550
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,978
I GOTTA SAY,
WHEN I FIRST MET HER,

551
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,413
I DIDN'T CARE MUCH
FOR HER,

552
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:16,983
BECAUSE, LIKE 99% OF THE PEOPLE
IN ANY GIVEN DAY

553
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,252
OF MY LIFE,
SHE WAS VERY BELLIGERENT

554
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,687
AND DISAGREEABLE.

555
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,691
MISS KNOPE WAS ATTRACTIVE
TO ME AS A MAN.

556
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:28,261
I WAS ATTRACTED TO HER
IN HER DEMEANOR.

557
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,797
I WAS ATTRACTED TO HER
IN A SEXUAL MANNER

558
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,033
THAT WAS APPROPRIATE.

559
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,868
CAN WE--I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

560
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:39,306
- [sighs]
WHAT A CRAZY NIGHT.

561
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,307
HUH, PARTNER?

562
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,342
WANT TO GO GET
SOME BREAKFAST?

563
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,277
- WHAT? NO.
TAKE ME HOME.

564
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,445
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

565
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:46,779
- * I'LL BE WATCHING YOU

566
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:47,980
- OH, MY GOD.

567
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,782
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS ON!

568
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,618
- * EVERY SINGLE DAY

569
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:52,985
- I WONDER IF MINI GOLF IS OPEN.

570
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,821
- HOME!

571
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,925
[muffled chatter]

572
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,059
- ANN-DANAWICZ,

573
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,528
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

574
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,862
EATING? LOVE IT.

575
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,464
OH, HEY, JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU

576
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,932
FOR HAVING ME ARRESTED
AS A PERVERT THE OTHER NIGHT.

577
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:06,933
THAT WAS COOL.

578
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,436
PEACE.

579
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:10,670
- UH, WE DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE A PERVERT.

580
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:11,804
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE
A CRIMINAL.

581
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,375
- FOR THE RECORD,
I STILL ACTUALLY KIND OF THINK

582
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,410
HE'S A PERVERT.
