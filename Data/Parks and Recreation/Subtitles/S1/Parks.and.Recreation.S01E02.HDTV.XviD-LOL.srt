Leslie,i just have to say

58
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,120
I think You might be taking this

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,180
To the public A little bit too soon.

60
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,570
It literally doesn't matter
What you propose to the public,

61
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,850
They might call for a vote.

62
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,440
And if they vote you
down,Then you're done.

63
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,140
I don't care If there's gonna be a vote.

64
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,860
I have a secret weapon.

65
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,380
Canvassing.

66
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,570
Nothing better Than good
old-fashioned Door-to-door campaigning.

67
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,760
I'm not above using My expertise

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,060
To change hearts and
minds If the cause is just.

69
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,570
When i was in sixth grade,

70
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,650
I was voted best dressed By 87 votes.

71
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,870
And there were only
63 people In my class.

72
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,470
Andy fell into that pit.

73
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,390
I fell into that pit.

74
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,630
How many more pawnee citizens
Are going to have to fall

75
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,110
Into that pit Before we turn it to park?

76
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,190

82
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,000

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,890
"if a person is a man,Turn to page two."

85
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,200
"if the person looks
Like a celebrity--

86
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,080
Jack nicholson-- Use
this to help your pitch.

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,580

turn it Into a park."

89
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,890

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,320
Okay,okay,look,i didn't Want
it to have to come to this,

177
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,010
But,ann,please open the sealed
Envelope that's in your binder.

178
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,220
This is a little something
I learned from karl rove.

179
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,920
If you want to guarantee
The results of a survey,

180
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,660
You design the question

181
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,650
To give you the answer That you want.

182
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,050
"wouldn't you rather have A park

183
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,280
Than a storage facility
For nuclear waste?"

184
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,520
That seems iffy.

185
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,170
Yeah,don't worry about
it. I made it all up.

186
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,650
Yeah,that's--
That's what i mean.

187
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,940
Wouldn't you agree,

188
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,870
Like most decent aricans,

189
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,730
That it would be a good idea To turn

190
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,510
The abandoned lot On sullivan street

191
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,780
Into a beautiful community park?

192
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,200
Oh,actually,no.

193
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,810
I'm not really a fan Of parks.

194
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,200
Very noisy. Barbecue smell all the time.

195
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,220
Would you change your mind If i told you

196
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,910
That nine out of ten meth
users Said the same exacthing?

197
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,140
What?

198
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,640
How would you even know that?

199
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,460
Survey.

200
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,400
We surveyed crystal meth users.

201
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,010
We're actually having

202
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,220

203
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,850

But i just don't like Living near parks.

205
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,010
So do you have a flier Or something?

206
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,830

- Thank you.
- Okay.

208
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,330
You don't care About your kids
If you don't support this park.

209
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,290
Excuse me?

210
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,120

So if i don't support
Your little project,

213

Then i don't love my daughter?

214
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,870

228
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520

229
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,820
Where you can hook me up.

230

Oh,my god. Ann,game changer.

All of a sudden,there's all
This federal money coming in,

257
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,140
And paul,the city manager,Is telling us

258
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,550
To build parks,Start
new community programs.

259
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,240
It's horrifying.

260
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,090

261
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,510

- It can
bericky--  - Don't.

271
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,120
Why do i want to build This park so bad?

272
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,070
Maybe because a pit filled
With garbage isn't the best

273
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,630
That we can do In america.

274
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,000
You know,in russia,

275
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,300
They could pretend That pit was a park.

276
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,440
Bring their kids down there.

277
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,440
"hey,vlad,Look at these rocks.

278
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,170
"let's pretend They're potatoes.

279
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,420
"nikolai,

280
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,960
Do you want to swim In the dirt?"

281
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,770
But not here,okay?

282
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,660
'Cause we're a nation Of dreamers.

283
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,780
And it is my dream

284
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,900

How was canvassing?

293
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,920
Canvassing was okay.

294
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,150
But i think we're going to have To

295
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,160

296
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,890

There's a mutual respect There.

303
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,280
And,together,we have decided
To fast-track your project.

304

City manager? Wow,really?

305
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,380

Oh,no,i can't do that.

364
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,070
That's illegal.

365
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,920
Thank you so much For
coming out tonight.

366
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,040
This is our first ti

367
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,800
About the proposal To turn lot 48

368
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,130
On sullivan street In a community park.

369
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,240
Yeah!

370
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,760
This is gonna be A train wreck.

371
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
I want my daughter To be successful.

372
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,660
Which is why i always tell her,

373
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,970
"there's nothing wrong With
being a wife and mother."

374
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,060
Now,there are many
people That i spoke to

375
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,240
Who are passionately
in support Of this idea.

376
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,060
None of them were able
To make it tonight,

377
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,220
Unfortunately.

378
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,580
But they totally exist.

379
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,370
I did not make them up.

380
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,700
Oh,i see a question. Okay.

381
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,150
No,no.

382
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,090
No. No questions right now.

383
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,190
- My name is kate speevack...
- I remember you.

384
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,880
And i live In the neighborhood.

385
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,910
And i am 100% Against this park.

386
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,050
I cannot believe the
department Is moving forward

387
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,300
With a project without a single
Environmental impact study.

388
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,090
And if you guys agree With me,

389
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,150
Let's ke a stand.

390
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,550
Okay.

391
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,820
Um,we are a little ahead Of schedule

392
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,250
Because we're holding This
town hall meeting so soon.

393
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,400
Which i was warned about
By mark brendanawicz,

394
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,870
Our city planner
Assigned to this project.

395
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,300
Uh,so what would he say?

396
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,320
Here we are.

397
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,840
Leslie,should i give them

398
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,140
Some background info On the site?

399
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,140
Absolutely,okay.

400
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,730
Mark brendanawicz knows The
answer to every question.

401
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,970
He's amazing,And congratulations
for hearing Him speak.

402
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,200
Hi,there. Leslie might have
Oversold me a little bit.

403
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,250
Certainly did not. He's the man.

404
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,250
He's capable of anything. Okay.

405
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,860
Lot 48 is,uh,It's a rectangular lot.

406
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,970
It's got excellent drainage,

407
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,660
And it's on the corner
Of sullivan and collins.

408
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,360
Any questions?

409
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,110
I have more of a
comment Than a question.

410
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,370
- Go for it. 
- It's for the guy in the cast.

411
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,930
Here we go. Lawrence.

412
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,700
Yes,yes,yes.

413
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,120
That is andy dwyer.

414
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,950
He is a local resident,and
He tragicay ll in the pit.

415
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,480
Uh,yeah,i don't care About any of that.

416
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,770
He's the guy that plays
music All night in his garage.

417
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,490
It's driving me nuts.

418
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,560
Lawrence lives With his grandma.

419
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,580
Which is pretty awesome.

420
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,660
He takes care ofer,i guess.

421
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,830
But whatever. He's a douche bag.

422
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,810
It's loud. It's abusive.

423
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,300
And it's waking up My birds.

424
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,010
You have birds now?

425
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,070
Yeah,i have birds.

426
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,550
I have nice,pretty,Expensive birds.

427
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,540
And you play that
music,And it wakes them up.

428
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,460
Look,i don't work For
the government,okay.

429
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,410
Uh,i do py rock & roll.

430
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,520
Guilty as charged.

431
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,900
I'm in a band.

432
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,760
It's called just the tip.

433
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,980
And,actually,If anyone here
plays bass,We need a bassist.

434
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,580
Yes,okay,let's take A
five-minute break,shall we?

435
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,930
Uh,it is not going well At all.

436
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,710
It's going very poorly.

437
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,570
Okay,like you're crashing And burning.

438
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,660
Democracy's happening.
People are talking.

439
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,110
I mean,at least They
aren't apathetic,right?

440
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,150
You're right about that.

441
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,650
They're deeply negative.

442
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,340
You need to put a happy face On this,

443
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,310
Give me A few positive talking points.

444
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,240
And whatever you do,Avd a vote.

445
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,820
I'm oddly attracted To kate speevack.

446
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,660
Before we continue,I'd
love to just give you

447
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,490
A little history of wnee.

448
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,080
The city of pawnee Was
incorporated in 1817

449
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,880
When a young man by the name
Of reverend luther howell

450
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,450
Came from terre haute On an ox.

451
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,550
He planted his flag In
the ground and was met

452
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,850
Soon aft by an angry
tribe Of wamapoke indians,

453
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,690
Who,when seeing the
whiteness Of his skin,

454
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,720
Twisted him to death.

455
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,710
Flash forward to 1969.

456
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,590
Man walks on the moon.

457
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,230
Pawnee is lousy With hippies...

458
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,490
My god,she's filibustering
Her own meeting.

459
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,430
Mod squad--
Filibuster. Boom.

460
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,170
They can't touch you
If you talk forever.

461
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,080
I can't speak of the future.

462
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,540
But i will.

463
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,110
The future of pawnee will
Involve us flying around

464
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,790
In space taxis Where we will communicate

465
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:12,400
On watches and blink Our
feelings to each other

466
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,380
Rather than use words.

467
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,090
And now i'd like to take

468
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,610
A magical journey
Through a little something

469
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,670
I like to call The phantom tollbooth

470
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,290
By norton juster.

471
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,380
Excuse me,can't you read

472
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,930
That children's book On your own time?

473
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,560
I have the floor.

474
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,060
"there once was a boy Named milo

475
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,430
"who didn't know what
to do With himself.

476
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,800
Not just
sometimes,But always"--

477
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,910
Okay,all right,You know
what, This is a public forum,

478
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,890
Which means that we all get
To tell you what we think.

479
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,470
Well,you did already talk,Ma'am.

480
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,470
And i would love To
listen to someone else,

481
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,820
Someone i don't know.

482
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,190
Uh,that girl over there

483
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,000
With the long brown
hair And the yellow top.

484
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,830
Could you tell us how
you feel About this park?

485
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,140
- Go ahead. 
- Hi.

486
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,550
Uh,i'm a youth In the community,

487
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,040
And i think a new park Is a great ia.

488
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,870
And i fully support it,

489
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,140
As would the rest of the
youth In the community.

490
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,920
Hey,i recognize her.

491
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,690
That kid came to my door Yesterday.

492
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,510
Oh,my god,okay,they have
Planted people in this audience.

493
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,880
Unbelievable.

494
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,230
U know what,we all agree
That this park is a baidea.

495
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,960
We should just take a vote.

496
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,960
- Right? 
- Okay,we will take a vote Before we do that,

497
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,990
I want everyone up,Lined
up behind that microphone.

498
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,080
I want to hear from
all of you,One-by-one.

499
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,250
That was brutal.

500
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,730
A couple weeks ago,I was yelling

501
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,110
At leslie At a public forum.

502
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,660
God,i hope i wasn't As
obnoxious as those people.

503
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,970
I wasn't,right?

504
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,460
At 5:00 in the
morning,Every morning--

505
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,330
Beep,beep,beep-- I
don't want to hear that.

506
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,130
Now,how long Is this project gonna take?

507
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,470
That's what i wanna know.
That's what's important to me.

508
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,630
Because i need my sleep.

509
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,810

Public forums in the future,

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,080
But,you know,that's
pawnee. That's democracy.

517
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,500
There are a lot of people
here That want this park.

518
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,960
You just gotta get past
The negative people.

519
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,130
But guess what?

520
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,170
