1
00:00:01,769 --> 00:00:04,272
>> SO WE'VE BEEN CALLED OUT
TO HIS HIKING TRAIL

2
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:06,074
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME REPORTS
THAT SOME TEENAGERS

3
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:08,542
ARE DIGGING BAGS OF DOG POOP
OUT OF THE TRASH

4
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,478
AND HAVING DOG POOP FIGHTS.

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,513
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,461
OH, MY GOD, IT'S REAL.

7
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:30,098
>> UH, YEAH, I'M NOT GONNA--
I'M NOT GONNA GO DEAL WITH THIS.

8
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:32,566
I'M LEAVING.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,801
>> HEY.

10
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,403
HEY.

11
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,171
HELLO?
BOYS.

12
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:38,606
I AM LESLIE KNOPE.

13
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,542
I WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT
OF PARKS AND RECREATION.

14
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,577
OKAY.

15
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:44,645
ALL RIGHT.

16
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,180
COOL IT.
OKAY.

17
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:47,515
NO!
AHH!

18
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,583
THAT'S DISGUSTING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:52,086
NO! OH!
HELP! HELP!

20
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,654

21
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,189

00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:56,524
NO!
AHH!

23
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,758
OH, IT SMELLS SO BAD.

24
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,527
OH! OH!

25
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,562
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
THIS WAS FUN? OW!

26
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,131
OH, REALLY?
OH, REALLY?

27
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:04,465
OH, REALLY?
OH, HEY, HEY.

28
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:05,799
YOU LIKE IT?
BOOM.

29
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,636
[groaning]

30
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:10,571
OKAY.
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

31
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,273
WHO WANTS IT?

32
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,843
HA, HA.
WHOO, MISSED IT.

33
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,745
YEAH, OH!

34
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,713
[panting]
ACTUALLY, THIS IS A LITTLE FUN.

35
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,416
THIS IS FUN.

36
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,619
OH.

37
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:28,622
[triumphant music]

38
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:36,664
*

39
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,875
OH, HEY, TOM,
CHECK IT OUT.

40
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,178
NORTON CONSTRUCTION
JUST SENT THIS OVER.

41
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,812
>> WHOA, MAMA.

42
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,481
>> I LOVE GREAT LAKES WINE.

43
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:54,615
>> YOU CAN HAVE THE WINE.

44
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,485
I WANNA TAKE THAT CHEESE
AND DO TERRIBLE THINGS TO IT.

45
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,353
>> OH, DAH, DAH, DAH.

46
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:00,354
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

47
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,690
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
THAT WE ARE NOT ALLOWED

48
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:06,560
TO ACCEPT GIFTS OVER $25
FOR CORRUPTION REASONS.

49
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:09,430
WE LIVE IN A FISH BOWL, AND
THE PUBLIC IS ALWAYS WATCHING.

50
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,898
THAT'S WHY I GO
TWO TOWNS OVER

51
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,666
IF I WANT TO RENT A MOVIE
WITH NUDITY IN IT.

52
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,202
>> MMM.

53
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,903
>> YEAH, I PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.

54
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,338
BUT YOU CANNOT
ENJOY THIS BASKET.

55
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,606
I'M SO SORRY.

56
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,641
SO TO AVOID TEMPTATION
I'M GONNA LOCK IT UP.

57
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,543
>> WHEN YOU'RE
IN THE GOVERNMENT,

58
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:25,279
THERE'S A MILLION WAYS
TO EXPLOIT YOUR POWER.

59
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,181
HAVE I EVER GIVEN IN
TO THAT TEMPTATION?

60
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:28,249
NO, NEVER.

61
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,650
I'M NOT THAT KIND
OF POLITICIAN.

62
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:30,484
OFFICIAL PARKS AND REC
BUSINESS.

63
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,553
I JUST NEED TO GRAB
A QUICK HOT DOG.

64
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:33,754
SORRY ABOUT THAT,
LITTLE GIRL.

65
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,189
YOU CAN HAVE THE NEXT ONE.

66
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,591
I HAVE A MORAL CODE,
AND I NEVER VIOLATE IT.

67
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,826
PEOPLE LOOK AT ME
AND THEY SAY,

68
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,461
"WOW, TOM,
YOU ARE SO PURE.

69
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,496
"YOU'RE LIKE A BROWN SUPERMAN
WITH A BEARD

70
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,266
"THAT JUST STANDS
FOR JUSTICE AND TRUTH

71
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,900
AND THE AMERICAN WAY."

72
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,637
>> SO, ANN,
I ASKED APRIL TO CREATE

73
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,672
ONE OF THOSE SOCIAL NETWORK
INTERNET PROFILES

74
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,541
FOR THE SULLIVAN STREET PIT.

75
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,975
SO ARE YOU GUYS READY
FOR THE DEBUT?

76
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,544
>> YES, CAN WE CUT
THAT RED RIBBON

77
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:57,845
AROUND YOUR MONITOR NOW?

78
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,980
>> ABSOLUTELY.
I LOVE A GOOD RIBBON CUTTING.

79
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,450
WOW.

80
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,585
OH, APRIL, THAT'S GOOD.
KIDS.

81
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:08,422
>> HEY, LOOK, THE PIT
ALREADY HAS SIX FRIENDS.

82
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:09,790
>> OH, YEAH, MARK.
MARK'S A FRIEND.

83
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,492
>> WHOA, WHOA, YOU GUYS
GOTTA SEE MARK'S PROFILE.

84
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,562
LOOK AT THE PHOTOS

85
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,264
>> WOW.
>> SICK.

86
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,865
>> MAYBE THOSE
ARE HIS RELATIVES.

87
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,568
>> YEAH, MAYBE FAKE BOOBS
RUN IN HIS FAMILY.

88
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,970
>> LOOK AT THIS LADY.
SHE'S GOT A THONG ON HER FACE.

89
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,506
>> OH, MY GOD, HIS FAVORITE
MOVIE IS DANCES WITH WOLVES.

90
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,907
>> OKAY, WE'RE GOOD.

91
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,542
WE'LL KEEP
CHECKING IN ON THIS.

92
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,577
>> WHERE IS MARK ANYWAY?

93
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,011
>> ATTENDING
YET ANOTHER MEETING

94
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,380
OF THE OLD BOYS' CLUB.

95
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,416
POLITICS IS FULL
OF BOYS' CLUBS,

96
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,385
FORMAL AND INFORMAL.

97
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,320
BEHIND ME ARE ALL THE MEMBERS
OF THE CITY COUNCIL

98
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,854
OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS.

99
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,423
AND EVERY DAY,
AS A WOMAN,

100
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,757
I HAVE TO WALK PAST
THIS WALL OF MEN.

101
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,526
IT CAN BE VERY UPSETTING,

102
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,661
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE
OF THAT GUY.

103
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,297
NO MATTER
WHAT DIRECTION I MOVE,

104
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,465
HE'S ALWAYS STARING
AT MY CHEST.

105
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,401
HMM?

106
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,802
SEE?

107
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,937
>> WHAT ARE THEY DOING
OUT THERE?

108
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,672
>> WHEELING AND DEALING.

109
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,409
DIVVYING UP THE EMPIRE.

110
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:02,976
>> EH, MY WIFE
GOT ME THIS SHIRT.

111
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,778
SHE SWEARS IT MAKES ME
LOOK THINNER.

112
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:06,514
>> IT KINDA DOES.

113
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,316
>> YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?
LET'S GO OUT THERE.

114
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,817
LET'S BUST UP
THAT OLD BOYS' CLUB.

115
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,652
WE'RE DOING GREAT WORK
IN THE GOVERNMENT.

116
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:12,853
WE DESERVE TO BE INCLUDED.

117
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,622
>> SURE, YEAH,
I COULD USE A BEER.

118
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,023
>> YES, ANN, THAT'S GOOD.
THINK LIKE A MAN.

119
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,691
APRIL, WE'RE LEAVING.

120
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,727
YOU'RE IN CHARGE,
AND IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A WOMAN.

121
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,662
>> WHAT, DO YOU REALLY LIKE
RED TAPE AND UPHILL BATTLES?

122
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,897
>> HEY, LESLIE.
>> HEY.

123
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,065
>> WHAT IS UP?

124
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,334
>> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S UP.

125
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,603
COUPLE OF LADIES ARE COMING TO
BUST UP YOUR LITTLE BOYS' CLUB.

126
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,539
>> AWESOME.
GLAD TO HAVE YOU.

127
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:32,906
GET YOU A BEER.

128
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,708
>> [whispered]
WE'RE IN.

129
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,076
>> HEY, I'M BRIAN.
>> HI, BRIAN.

130
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,645
LESLIE KNOPE,
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF--

131
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,012
>> DRINK THAT.
>> OKAY.

132
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,649
>> I'M ANN, EVERYONE.
I DON'T WORK HERE.

133
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,484
>> ANN.

134
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,552
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

135
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:45,653
WHAT'S TOPIC DU JOUR?

136
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,421
OH, OH, OH.

137
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,056
[bottles shattering]

138
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,724
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

139
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,393
THAT WAS THE SOUND

140
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,695
OF A GLASS CEILING
BEING SHATTERED.

141
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,965
THE BOYS' CLUB IS MORE ABOUT
SOCIALIZING THAN WORK, YOU KNOW?

142
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,567
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA LOOSEN UP.

143
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,969
I KINDA FEEL LIKE
I'M ALREADY IN THE BOYS' CLUB.

144
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:06,006
I MEAN, LOOK AT THOSE BITCHES
CLEAN UP AFTER ME.

145
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,542
>> SO IS THIS, LIKE, YOUR
REGULAR TUESDAY NIGHT SCENE?

146
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:11,011
>> WELL, IT'S JUST
A WAY TO UNWIND, YOU KNOW?

147
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,946
>> REALLY DIFFERENT FROM
YOUR FRIDAY NIGHT CROWD, RIGHT?

148
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,482
>> WHAT CROWD?

149
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,617
>> YOU KNOW, THE GIRLS WITH
THE TRIBAL BACK TATTOOS

150
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,918
WHO DRINK RED BULL
FOR A LIVING.

151
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,353
>> OH.
>> THAT CROWD.

152
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:20,654
>> OH, I LIKE THIS.
THIS IS BANTER.

153
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:21,789
BANTER'S FUN.
>> WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?

154
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,525
>> WE WERE JUST ON THE COMPUTER
LOOKING AT YOUR PROFILE.

155
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,394
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A FRIEND
WHO HAS A TATTOO

156
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,797
THAT SAYS "DADDY'S GIRL"
AND BOTH WORDS ARE MISSPELLED.

157
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,132
>> OH, MIXING IT UP
WITH THE BOYS.

158
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,667
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?
WHAT'S YOUR COMEBACK?

159
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,403
>> THOSE AREN'T REALLY
MY FRIENDS ANYMORE.

160
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,037
I DON'T HANG OUT WITH THEM.

161
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,472
>> OH, BOO.

162
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,907
BRENDANAWICZ,
THAT'S SOME WEAK SAUCE.

163
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,041
YOU NEED TO HIT HARDER.

164
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,912
>> NATALIE,
IT'S YOUR SISTER.

165
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,516
PICK ME UP OR I'M GONNA DRAW
ALL OVER YOUR JEANS.

166
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,454
>> WELL, IT'S OFFICIAL,
PEOPLE.

167
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,655
WE'RE OUTTA BEER.

168
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,989
>> AHH, THAT'S THE CUE.

169
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,791
SEE YOU LATER, LESLIE.

170
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,560
IT WAS NICE HANGING OUT,
YOU KNOW, AFTER WORK HOURS.

171
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:00,661
>> WAIT.

172
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,795
>> I THINK I'M GONNA
TAKE OFF TOO.

173
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,163
>> YEAH, I SHOULD GO, LESLIE.

174
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,898
>> WAIT, YOU GUYS, LET'S KEEP
THIS GOOD FEELING GOING.

175
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,567
IT'S JUST GETTING STARTED.

176
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,935
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE PARTIES
USUALLY GET STARTED

177
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,570
WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF BOOZE.

178
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,740
>> OKAY, WAIT.
JUST HOLD ON A SECOND.

179
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:28,656
I GOT WINE.

180
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:29,990
>> all: HEY!

181
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,158
>> AND CHEESE.

182
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,627
>> all: HEY!

183
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,128
>> WHOO.

184
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,031
>> GOOD MORNING.

185
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,068
LAST NIGHT IN A FOOLISH ATTEMPT
TO INFILTRATE A BOYS' CLUB

186
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,837
I VIOLATED THE GOVERNMENT
EMPLOYEE ETHICS CODE

187
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,606
OF THE STATE OF INDIANA.

188
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,008
I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO LIVE
MY LIFE IN AN ETHICAL WAY,

189
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,910
AND LAST NIGHT I FAILED.

190
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,211
I REALIZE I HAVE LET DOWN

191
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,714
EVERY FEMALE
PUBLIC OFFICIAL IN AMERICA,

192
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,216
AND I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE
TO THEM RIGHT NOW,

193
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,986
INDIVIDUALLY
AND IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER.

194
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,188
MICHELE BACHMANN,

195
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,525
REPUBLICAN, MINNESOTA,

196
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,927
I AM SORRY.

197
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,130
TAMMY BALDWIN,
DEMOCRAT, WISCONSIN,

198
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,832
I'M SO SORRY, TAMMY.

199
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,201
MELISSA BEAN.

200
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,436
[dog growling]

201
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,144
[video game sounds]

202
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,747
>> OKAY.

203
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,915
DOUBLE SHIFT, REMEMBER?

204
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,216
SO I WON'T SEE
YOU TILL TOMORROW.

205
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,551
ARE YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

206
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,919
>> OH, YEAH.

207
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,021
I GOT, UH...DINNER.

208
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:34,988
>> OH, GOD.

209
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:38,926
HONEY, CAN YOU JUST
CLEAN UP A LITTLE BIT?

210
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,761
>> I'LL TRY.

211
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,162
DON'T EXPECT MUCH.

212
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,231
>> OKAY, WELL,
I'LL DO IT WHEN I GET HOME.

213
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,099
>> YOU WILL?
>> YES.

214
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,068
>> ANN IS AMAZING.

215
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,637
SHE TAKES CARE OF ME.

216
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,872
SHE TAKES CARE OF SICK PEOPLE,
SICK BABIES.

217
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,707
SHE IS AN ANGEL.

218
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:56,544
AND I SERIOUSLY LOVE HER.

219
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:57,878
HARD.

220
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,781
SHE'S GOING TO BE GONE
FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

221
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,650
SO I MADE THIS LIST,

222
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,117
AND BASICALLY
THIS PLACE IS GONNA BE

223
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,755
LIKE A SPARKLING PALACE
WHEN SHE RETURNS.

224
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,122
I TOOK A BUNCH
OF PAIN KILLERS.

225
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,759
THEY'RE ABOUT TO KICK IN,
SO I'M READY TO GO.

226
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,096
>> HERE IT IS.
LET'S CLEAR THE AIR.

227
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,766
LAST NIGHT I OPENED UP
THIS GIFT BASKET

228
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,100
FOR MY OWN PLEASURE.

229
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,101
>> REALLY?

230
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,571
LESLIE KNOPE, USUALLY SUCH
A PRUDISH STICKLER

231
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,238
FOR THE RULES.

232
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,907
>> I'M NOT HAPPY
ABOUT IT EITHER, TOM.

233
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,141
>> IT'S LIKE I DON'T EVEN
KNOW YOU ANYMORE.

234
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,010
>> LAST YEAR YOU WROTE ME UP
FOR MAKING PERSONAL PHONE CALLS

235
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:30,878
TO MY MOM.

236
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,713
>> YES, I DID,
AND I WOULD DO IT AGAIN.

237
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,582
TWO WRONGS
DO NOT MAKE A RIGHT.

238
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,050
>> YES, BUT SHE
WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

239
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,587
>> I DID NOT KNOW THAT
AT THE TIME.

240
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,121
>> SO CAN I HAVE THE BASKET?

241
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,189
>> NO, I'M SORRY.
IT'S EVIDENCE.

242
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,757
>> IT'S A NICE BASKET.

243
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,258
>> WHAT WOULD YOU
PUT IN THERE?

244
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,060
>> I DON'T KNOW,
POTPOURRI.

245
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,261
>> THAT'S A LOT OF POTPOURRI.

246
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,897
>> HEY, I AM NOT THE ONE
ON TRIAL HERE.

247
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,832
>> I APPRECIATE
AND THANK YOU IN ADVANCE

248
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,233
FOR YOUR UNWAVERING SUPPORT.

249
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,201
>> I THINK YOU SHOULD
GO TO JAIL,

250
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,569
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

251
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:58,872
>> GO TO JAIL?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

252
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,340
>> RON,
I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT

253
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,076
AND VERY LONG STORY
TO TELL YOU.

254
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,312
>> PUT IT IN AN EMAIL?

255
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,280
>> NOPE.

256
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,116
IT HAPPENED RIGHT OUT THERE,

257
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,351
RIGHT OUTSIDE THIS WINDOW.

258
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,186
WHY CAN'T I LOOK AWAY?

259
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,155
>> LET'S NOT BLOW THIS
OUT OF PROPORTION.

260
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:18,091
>> I WILL BLOW THIS
IN PROPORTION.

261
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,228
THE MINIMUM PUNISHMENT FOR THIS
IS AN OFFICIAL REPRIMAND

262
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,663
FROM THE CITY MANAGER.

263
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,197
>> IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

264
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,899
>> MAYBE IN YOUR WORLD
IT ISN'T A BIG DEAL.

265
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,701
YOU'RE A WHITE PROTESTANT MAN

266
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,302
WITH A FULL, RICH MOUSTACHE.

267
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,171
BUT I AM A WOMAN,

268
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,273
AND I NEED TO HOLD MYSELF UP
TO A HIGHER STANDARD.

269
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,808
>> THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

270
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,109
YOU'RE PUNISHING YOURSELF

271
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,278
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
IS GONNA PUNISH YOU.

272
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,180
>> NO.
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST WE DO?

273
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,649
YOU THINK WE SHOULD
COVER THIS UP?

274
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,183
>> NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

275
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,284
NO ONE SAID "COVER-UP".

276
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,220
>> GOOD BECAUSE THE COVER-UP
IS WORSE THAN THE CRIME.

277
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,123
WHEN YOU SPILL SOMETHING
AND YOU TRY TO WIPE IT UP

278
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:53,794
WITH SOMETHING THAT'S DIRTY,
THEN YOU GET DOUBLE DIRTY.

279
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,128
>> PLEASE DON'T
MAKE THIS WORSE.

280
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,196
>> OH, MY GOD.

281
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,265
GOOD AFTERNOON.

282
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:01,401
SINCE WE LAST SPOKE,
I HAVE TAKEN EXTRAORDINARY STEPS

283
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,805
TO MAKE FURTHER AMENDS
FOR THE MISTAKES THAT I'VE MADE.

284
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,074
I HAVE WRITTEN
A FULL CONFESSION,

285
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,341
WHICH I WILL BE EMAILING

286
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,812
TO EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE
PAWNEE GOVERNMENT.

287
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:15,683
I'VE ALSO ATTACHED A LINK
TO THE PIT'S WEB PAGE

288
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,285
JUST TO REMIND PEOPLE
OF ALL THE GOOD WORK THAT I DO.

289
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,220
I ASKED RON TO BLOW
THE WHISTLE ON ME,

290
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,221
AND HE REFUSED.

291
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,792
AND THAT IS WHY
I HAD TO WHISTLE-BLOW MYSELF.

292
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,797
>> I WISH I COULD SAY
SOME OF THIS MESS WAS ANN'S,

293
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,065
BUT IT'S ALL MINE.

294
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:36,036
I'M KIND OF A NESTER.

295
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,405
EH, NOT BAD FOR A GUY
WITH TWO BROKEN LEGS.

296
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,081
HEY.

297
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,285
>> DOING A LITTLE
EXPERIMENT TONIGHT

298
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,155
TO SEE WHAT WILL
GET ME DRUNKER--

299
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,356
DRINKING WINE--

300
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,958
>> LESLIE, COME HERE.

301
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,693
SEE WHAT APRIL
PUT ON THE PIT'S WEB PAGE.

302
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:02,029
>> RIGHT NOW DRINKING WINE
IS WINNING.

303
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,697
>> OH, MY GOD,
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

304
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,766
>> A VIDEO OF ME DRINKING
SOME OF THAT WINE YOU STOLE.

305
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,900
>> WHAT?

306
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,969
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

307
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,138
>> BECAUSE I WAS WAITING
FOR MY SISTER AND I WAS BORED,

308
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,106
AND MY HAIR
LOOKED REALLY GOOD.

309
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,842
>> AND YOU PUT IT
IN THE PIT'S WEB PAGE?

310
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,009
>> YEAH.

311
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,210
>> OKAY, TAKE THIS OFF.

312
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,012
OKAY, I JUST SENT AN EMAIL
TO EVERYONE IN THE GOVERNMENT

313
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,147
AND I PUT A LINK
TO THIS PAGE.

314
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,414
>> [humming]

315
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,850
>> A YOUNG LAWBREAKER.

316
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,052
A FUTURE LESLIE KNOPE.

317
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,486
PLAY IT AGAIN FOR US, JERRY.

318
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,321
>> YOU GOT IT.

319
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,326
>> LESLIE.

320
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,963
SHE'S 19 YEARS OLD.

321
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,265
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
NOT TO MAKE THIS WORSE.

322
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,733
>> AND I HEARD YOU
LOUD AND CLEAR.

323
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,168
>> BUT THEN YOU MADE IT WORSE.

324
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:45,205
THE DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE'S
HAVING A HEARING TOMORROW

325
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,174
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TESTIFY.

326
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,275
>> OH, NO.

327
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,477
>> APRIL MIGHT GET DISMISSED.
YOU COULD GET FIRED.

328
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,512
>> OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

329
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,182
OH, NO.
OH, GOD.

330
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,084
OH, THIS BENCH
IS SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

331
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,820
OW, HELP.
PLEASE, RON.

332
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:03,156
RON, RON,
TELL ME IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

333
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,257
TELL ME IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

334
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,459
>> IT'S GONNA--
>> RON, WHERE ARE YOU?

335
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:09,196
>> IT'LL--HANG IN.

336
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,032
>> RON.
>> OKAY, YOU'RE OKAY.

337
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,200
>> [sobbing]
GOOD EVENING.

338
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,135
I'VE SPOKEN TO YOU
A COUPLE TIMES

339
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,170
ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED,

340
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,139
BUT I DON'T WANNA--

341
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:22,142
I DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

342
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,914
>> SO THE DISCIPLINARY
COMMITTEE AWAITS.

343
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,849
FEELING GOOD?
FEELING STRONG?

344
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:29,983
>> NOT REALLY, NO.

345
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,451
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO RUN
SOME TEST QUESTIONS WITH YOU,

346
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,886
MAYBE GIVE YOU AN IDEA

347
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,187
OF WHAT THE DISCIPLINARY
COMMITTEE WILL BE LIKE?

348
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:36,556
>> YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.
YEAH, THANKS, TOM.

349
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,258
>> OKAY.

350
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,294
SO, MS. KNOPE,

351
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,496
YOU'RE ACCUSED
OF STEALING WINE.

352
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,432
HOW MANY DRINKS DO YOU HAVE
PER WEEK ON AVERAGE?

353
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,835
>> ZERO.

354
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,202
ZERO TO SIX.

355
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,238
>> I'M GONNA WRITE DOWN "TEN".

356
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,372
>> YEAH.

357
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,540
>> DO YOU EVER CHEAT
ON YOUR TAXES?

358
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,375
>> NO, NO, NO, NEVER.

359
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,944
>> GOOD.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

360
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,312
HOW MANY SEXUAL PARTNERS
HAVE YOU HAD IN THE LAST YEAR?

361
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,148
>> ARE THEY GONNA ASK THAT?

362
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,482
>> THIS IS A DEPOSITION-STYLE
HEARING, MS. KNOPE.

363
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,284
NOTHING IS OFF-LIMITS.
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER.

364
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,486
NOW HOW MANY SEXUAL PARTNERS
HAVE YOU HAD IN THE LAST YEAR?

365
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,156
>> ZERO TO SIX.

366
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,123
>> ZERO.

367
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,591
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT RON SEXUALLY?

368
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,560
>> WHAT?!
>> INCLUDING DREAMS.

369
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,228
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
A SEXUAL DREAM

370
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,563
ABOUT OUR BOSS,
RON SWANSON?

371
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,398
>> NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT, NO.

372
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,233
>> YES.
>> NO.

373
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,235
>> NOW IN THIS RECURRING DREAM
THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT RON,

374
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,205
IS HE, LIKE, A REGULAR RON
OR IS HE HALF-RON, HALF-ANIMAL,

375
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,373
LIKE A CENTAUR?

376
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,507
>> WHAT?

377
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,242
>> IS HE WEARING
A FOOTBALL UNIFORM?

378
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,443
ARE YOU MAKING LOVE TO HIM

379
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,245
ON A COUCH
SHAPED LIKE HIS MOUSTACHE?

380
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,314
IS HE COVERED IN POWERADE?

381
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,448
>> NO, OKAY,
TIME-OUT, TIME-OUT.

382
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,184
>> THIS COMMITTEE DOESN'T
TAKE TIME-OUTS, MS. KNOPE.

383
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,485
NOW ANSWER THE QUESTION.

384
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,519
>> I NEED SOMETHING TO DRINK.

385
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,620
>> HOW 'BOUT SOME STOLEN WINE?

386
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,055
>> NO, I MEANT WATER.

387
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,523
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
MS. KNOPE.

388
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,059
YOU'RE FIRED.

389
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:48,128
SO THAT'S KINDA YOUR
WORST-CASE SCENARIO, YOU KNOW?

390
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,530
IF YOU CAN HANDLE THAT,
I THINK YOU'LL BE FINE.

391
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,466
>> GREAT.

392
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,503
RON, THANK YOU FOR BEING
HERE WITH ME TODAY.

393
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,372

>> YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE YOU ALLEGEDLY

397

00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,982
AND CONTRIBUTED
TO THE DELINQUENCY OF A MINOR.

399
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,884

WHAT HAPPENED?

400
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:13,086
>> I'M GONNA TAKE A GLASS
OF WATER FIRST IF I MAY.

401
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,055
>> CERTAINLY.
[glass rattling]

402
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,456

THEY CLEAN THEIR DOG.

THE FIRST THING YOU DID

464
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,049
WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT WORK
THE NEXT DAY?

465
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,318
CAN YOU GO OVER THE TIMELINE
FOR US ONCE MORE?

466
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,419
>> YES, OF COURSE.

WHAT MORE COULD YOU GUYS
POSSIBLY WANT HER TO DO?

470
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,229
>> WELL, WE DON'T KNOW YET.

471
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,331
FRANKLY, WE'VE GOT
A LOT MORE QUESTIONS.

472
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,565
>> [groans]
>> RON, IT'S OKAY.

473
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,167
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

474
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,635
THIS IS NOT COMMUNIST CHINA.

475
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,570
YOU CANNOT
MAKE HER WHIP HERSELF.

476
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,506
YOU CANNOT MAKE HER
WEAR A HAIR SHIRT.

477
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,741
>> WE WEREN'T PLANNING
ON DOING EITHER OF THOSE THINGS.

478
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,143
>> THIS IS AMERICA.

479
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,611
YOU WANNA LIVE
IN NORTH KOREA,

480
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,313
YOU CAN LIVE IN NORTH KOREA.

481
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,547
I DON'T WANT TO.

482
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,516
I WANT TO LIVE IN AMERICA.

483
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,252
LESLIE HAS NEVER BROKEN
A RULE IN HER LIFE,

484
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,622
TO THE POINT
THAT IT'S ANNOYING.

485
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,424
IF YOU WANT TO SLAP HER
ON THE WRIST, GO AHEAD.

486
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,591
YOU WANNA
DO ANYTHING MORE SERIOUS,

487
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,127
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GO THROUGH ME.

488
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,261
LET'S GO.
>> ARE WE DONE?

489
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,496
>> WE'RE DONE.
LET'S GO.

490
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,238
SO AFTER ALL THAT,
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD.

491
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,240
YOU'RE GONNA GET A LETTER
IN YOUR FILE.

492
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,708
>> RON, I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANK YOU--

493
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,076
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

494
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,117
NO, I DIDN'T DO IT
FOR LESLIE.

495
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:07,254
I DID IT BECAUSE
I HATE BUREAUCRACY.

496
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,556
MY IDEA
OF A PERFECT GOVERNMENT

497
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,226
IS ONE GUY WHO SITS
IN A SMALL ROOM AT A DESK,

498
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,195
AND THE ONLY THING
HE'S ALLOWED TO DECIDE

499
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,763
IS WHO TO NUKE.

500
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:20,133
THE MAN IS CHOSEN
BASED ON SOME KIND OF IQ TEST

501
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,602
AND MAYBE ALSO
A PHYSICAL TOURNAMENT,

502
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,771
LIKE A DECATHLON.

503
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:29,476
AND WOMEN ARE
BROUGHT TO HIM MAYBE

504
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,544
WHEN HE DESIRES THEM.

505
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,446
>> OH, HEY, ANN,
YOU'RE HERE.

506
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,681
>> YEAH, I CAME
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

507
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:35,815
HOW'D IT GO?

508
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,484
>> I DON'T WANNA
BE OVERDRAMATIC,

509
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,552
BUT TODAY FELT LIKE
100 YEARS IN HELL

510
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,154
AND THE ABSOLUTE WORST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

511
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,455
>> OH, GOD.

512
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,657
>> I NEVER SHOULDA OPENED
THAT STUPID BASKET.

513
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,593
>> YEAH, WHY DID YOU
OPEN THAT BASKET?

514
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,395
IT DOESN'T REALLY
SEEM LIKE YOU.

515
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,330
>> I THINK IT'S 'CAUSE I WANTED
TO SHATTER THE GLASS CEILING,

516
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,631
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

517
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,234
AND JUST KIND OF INFILTRATE
THE BOYS' CLUB.

518
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,469
>> HMM.

519
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,371
>> I DID IT FOR A GUY.

520
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,640
>> OH.
>> YEAH.

521
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,543
MARK.

522
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,578
>> OH.

523
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,480
OH, WOW.

524
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:08,815
>> WELL, I--

525
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,584
WE HAD A BRIEF AFFAIR
IN FEBRUARY

526
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,952
OF 2004.

527
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,588
AND, UM, THERE'S STILL

528
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,724
SOMETHING VERY COMPLICATED
BETWEEN US, SO.

529
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,627
>> YEAH, SURE.

530
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,628
>> YEAH.

531
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,595
>> SMART WOMAN.

532
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:25,665
IFFY CHOICE IN MEN.

533
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,601
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I'M NOT ONE TO TALK.

534
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,308
[gasps]

535
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,776
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

536
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,879
>> ANDY, THIS IS SO SWEET.

537
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,481
>> NOTHING.
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

538
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,483
>> OH, I WAS CHASING
OUR NEIGHBOR

539
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,985
WHO IS A TOTAL JAG-WEED.

540
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,655
AND I FELL
IN SOME PRICKLY BUSHES.

541
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,457
DOESN'T MATTER.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE HOUSE?

542
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,859
HMM?
WERE YOU TOTALLY SURPRISED?

543
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,361
>> YEAH.
>> DO YOU LOVE IT?

544
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:55,562
>> YEAH.

545
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:56,529
HERE, BABY, SIT DOWN.

546
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,599
I'M GONNA PUT SOMETHING
ON THOSE SCRATCHES.

547
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:03,503
>> SOMEBODY IS GETTING
GENTLY LAID TONIGHT.

548
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,473
>> ANDY, GOD.

549
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,316
>> YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU NEED ONE OF THESE.

550
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,484
>> [sighs]

551
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:18,718
>> COME ON.

552
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,553
YOU'RE OVER 21.

553
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,755
>> NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DRINKING
ON GOVERNMENT PROPERTY.

554
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,291
LOOSEN UP.

555
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,625
YOU'RE GONNA
DRIVE YOURSELF CRAZY

556
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,460
TRYING TO FOLLOW EVERY SINGLE
RULE IN GOVERNMENT.

557
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:31,431
>> MARK, I HAVE A LETTER
IN MY FILE.

558
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,466
>> I GOT SEVEN LETTERS
IN MY FILE.

559
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,502
PRETTY MUCH EVERY GUY
IN CITY PLANNING

560
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:38,004
HAS A BUNCH OF LETTERS.

561
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,572
SO WELCOME TO THE TEAM.

562
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,545
[bottles clink]

563
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,980
>> LOOK OUT, BOYS.
