1
00:00:01,796 --> 00:00:04,025
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

2
00:00:04,145 --> 00:00:07,580
No, babe. Are you ready?

3
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:08,290
Yes?

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,330
I got fired from running
the Sweetums Foundation.

5
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:11,956
Thanks to me.
Sorry, again.

6
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:14,099
Hey, blessing in disguise.

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,684
I took a job
at this accounting firm,

8
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:18,119
they've tried to hire me
three times, I finally gave in.

9
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:20,722
But I've had a week off
in between jobs,

10
00:00:20,756 --> 00:00:23,375
and I've been cooking up
something pretty big.

11
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:25,610
The last time
he was in between jobs,

12
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:27,595
he got deep into claymation,

13
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:31,383
so this should be different,
hopefully.

14
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:34,119
Presenting
"The Cones of Dunshire,"

15
00:00:34,153 --> 00:00:38,223
a brand-new gaming experience.
8 to 12 players.

16
00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:41,276
Two wizards, a Maverick,
the arbiter, two warriors,

17
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,978
a corporal, and a ledgerman.

18
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:44,696
Now, the ledgerman
just keeps score,

19
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,998
and he wears this hat.

20
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,082
Oh, boy.

21
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,818
Now, the object
is to accumulate cones.

22
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:52,254
Four cones wins,
but in order to get a cone,

23
00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:54,356
you have to build
a civilization.

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,325
The other amazing thing
is the challenge play.

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,261
Actually, let me tell you
more about the trivia cards,

26
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:01,129
'cause you're gonna need to know
about roadblocks first.

27
00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:03,031
Nah, never mind. The thing
about the challenge play

28
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:06,434
is that it's basically
the game...in reverse.

29
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:09,020
Then you roll three dice to see
how many dice you roll with.

30
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:10,956
Oh, 16.
Perfect, lots of choices.

31
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:13,859
Okay, each turn goes:
Roll, buy, action.

32
00:01:13,893 --> 00:01:15,944
I mean, obviously, this would be
much taller in the real game.

33
00:01:15,978 --> 00:01:17,829
But the corporal can veto.

34
00:01:17,864 --> 00:01:19,297
This should be green too.
How did this happen?

35
00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:21,416
Are the cones a metaphor?
Well, yes and no.

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,169
- What is this called again?
- "The Cones of Dunshire."

37
00:01:24,203 --> 00:01:26,221
Oh, my God, the Maverick should

38
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:28,190
be able to trade lumber
for agriculture credits.

39
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:32,127
How have I not
thought of this before?

40
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:33,211
This is nothing, right?

41
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:34,846
When do you go
back to work again?

42
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:35,881
Tomorrow. It's fine.

43
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:36,882
I'll just throw this
in the garbage.

44
00:01:39,852 --> 00:01:50,795
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

45
00:01:56,935 --> 00:01:58,336
As soon as Knope is gone,

46
00:01:58,387 --> 00:02:00,572
these are going up
all over Chambers.

47
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:02,123
Jamm for three!

48
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:03,324
Ha ha! What,
are you trying to build a house

49
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:04,960
with those bricks?

50
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,861
Ooh!
The girl is attacking me.

51
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:08,930
Any new business
before we adjourn?

52
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:10,432
Yes, I have one--

53
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:11,399
the Pawnee Commons.

54
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:12,617
Oh, boy.

55
00:02:12,652 --> 00:02:13,932
The money
for the Pawnee Commons,

56
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:16,021
aka the greatest future park
in the world,

57
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:17,355
aka my personal dream project...

58
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,241
Aka...

59
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:21,760
Is currently
in a discretionary fund.

60
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:23,211
I'd like to move it
to a lockbox,

61
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:25,163
to ensure that it is used
for that project.

62
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:27,716
The thing is, Leslie,
this kind of decision is--

63
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,434
it's not really up
to you anymore.

64
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:32,820
Because the voters, to use
a technical political term,

65
00:02:32,838 --> 00:02:34,556
gave you the stanky boot.

66
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,658
But we'll keep your money safe,
baby girl.

67
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:37,826
What, you think
I'm gonna use it

68
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,544
to put a new limestone shower
in my office?

69
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:41,179
Yeah, now I do.

70
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,714
I propose that
we table this discussion

71
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:45,300
until, let's say,
the second Knope is gone.

72
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,001
Later, bunheads.

73
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:48,186
Glass!

74
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:51,890
Video Ron demand.

75
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:53,207
What you carrying, my dude?

76
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:55,660
The time has come
to sell my cabin.

77
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:57,662
But I haven't had much luck
finding a buyer.

78
00:02:57,713 --> 00:02:59,264
"For sale. Small house.

79
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:00,899
Location: Forest."

80
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,483
It's a little wordy,
don't you think?

81
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,668
"Current owner will not
clean up

82
00:03:03,703 --> 00:03:07,388
shotgun shells
or animal carcasses."

83
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:08,907
The hell is wrong with you,
Swanson?

84
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:10,375
Fine, I'll clean up
the shotgun shells,

85
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:12,994
but the carcasses remain
to fertilize my berry patch.

86
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:15,030
If you really want to unload
that little horror cabin,

87
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:17,515
you gonna need a professional
to stage it properly.

88
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,153
Lucky for you, I recently
got my real estate license.

89
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:23,771
Spladow!

90
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:24,772
Check it.

91
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,591
"Regal Meagle Realty."

92
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:29,394
"Find your castle."

93
00:03:29,445 --> 00:03:32,013
Fine, I suppose
I could use some help.

94
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:33,348
Yo, Donna,
let me get a little skin

95
00:03:33,382 --> 00:03:34,766
in the game,
maybe split that commission?

96
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,121
All right.
Show me what you got.

97
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:37,485
I'll split that commish.

98
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:39,704
♪ Split that commish

99
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:41,639
The question I always
ask myself is,

100
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:43,325
what kind of mogul should I be?

101
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:45,627
Fashion mogul,
energy drink mogul.

102
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:47,462
I even thought
about downhill skiing.

103
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:48,496
A mogul mogul.

104
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,682
But a real estate mogul?

105
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:51,733
Hmm.

106
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,052
That's a hot mogul right now.

107
00:03:54,086 --> 00:03:56,137
Ben Wyatt, reporting for duty.

108
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:57,639
How you doing, Barney?
Good to see you again.

109
00:03:57,673 --> 00:04:00,942
I just can't believe
it's finally happening.

110
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:03,762
Dad! He's here!

111
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:05,580
He really came!

112
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:07,232
Hello, Ben. I'm Frank.

113
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,701
I took the job
when you passed it up last time.

114
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:10,719
Heard a lot about you.

115
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:12,587
Well, all good things, I hope.

116
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:13,721
A little too good.

117
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,223
Let's see if you live up
to the hype.

118
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:18,176
I'm not joking.

119
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,561
Oh.

120
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:22,097
Frank seems cool.

121
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:24,115
Well, tell everybody
in Michigan I said hi,

122
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,384
and tell your mom that
I love the banana cake

123
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:27,402
she posted on Pinterest.

124
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:29,204
Oh, the father of your child
is here.

125
00:04:29,238 --> 00:04:30,488
I have to go.
I'll talk to you soon.

126
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:31,806
- I love you.
- Was that Ann?

127
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:33,641
I hope you were speaking
to her in a calming voice

128
00:04:33,676 --> 00:04:35,193
'cause babies can hear
everything.

129
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:37,779
Baby, if you can still hear me,
I love you.

130
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:39,447
- The phone is hung up.
- Oh.

131
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:42,383
You got my message
about Jamm being a dinkhead?

132
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:44,969
Yes, but as city manager,
I can't play sides.

133
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:46,004
And I think
all of our heads can be

134
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:47,555
a little dinky at times.

135
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,107
Fine, but his is the dinkiest.

136
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:51,025
And I would know
because I'm keeping score.

137
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:53,044
Ever since
I started city council,

138
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:56,064
I have gone head-to-head
with Jamm 112 times.

139
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:59,084
He has won 56 times,
I have won 56 times.

140
00:04:59,135 --> 00:05:02,270
I will not lose
our last battle.

141
00:05:02,304 --> 00:05:06,207
Will you help me?

142
00:05:06,242 --> 00:05:07,559
No.

143
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:08,593
Oh.

144
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:09,761
The way you stood up like that,

145
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:11,112
I thought it was gonna go
a different way.

146
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:13,331
No, I can't help directly,
but I am on your side.

147
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:16,317
And I will assist you
in any way that I can.

148
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:18,186
Maybe I can mediate,
like Dr. Phil,

149
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,656
only qualified.

150
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:22,755
So what's the story, Ron?

151
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:23,925
Diane making you sell
this place?

152
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:24,926
Not at all.

153
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,945
Recently, I purchased
a new cabin

154
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,580
big enough
for the whole family.

155
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:32,934
I just can't justify
owning four cabins.

156
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:35,019
Two cabins.

157
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,772
The new cabin I bought
has a great tire swing

158
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:39,641
for the girls, access to a lake

159
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:43,478
for all the kids to play in.

160
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:45,513
Plus, it doesn't have
these razor-sharp

161
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:48,633
perimeter defense planks
sticking out of the ground.

162
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,536
I usually get a 5% commission,
but I'll do it for 3%.

163
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,504
Friends and family discount.

164
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:53,988
Make it 5%.

165
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:56,641
I don't want you getting any
ideas about us being friends.

166
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:58,309
- Respect.
- Donna, baby.

167
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,528
For the fireplace,
I'm thinking fake antlers.

168
00:06:00,563 --> 00:06:02,130
But what kind of scarves
do we want to hang

169
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:03,498
off the fake antlers?

170
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:05,650
- Oh, duh. Crocheted.
- Most def.

171
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:08,135
That'll look legit next to those
antique "Visit France" posters.

172
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:10,488
Mm.

173
00:06:10,523 --> 00:06:11,873
Ron, you want to stay outside

174
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:12,907
and do nothing while they make

175
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:13,958
your cabin look like garbage?

176
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,443
I'd like that very much.

177
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:17,612
We can watch the shadows
get longer.

178
00:06:17,646 --> 00:06:19,247
Okay.

179
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:21,049
Wow, you guys sure take

180
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,268
the start-up paperwork
seriously around here.

181
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,436
Sorry to start you out
like this,

182
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:26,988
and on a Friday no less.

183
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:28,957
But it's our toughest case.

184
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:32,994
Three competing family trusts,
a contested will--

185
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:36,347
it's a real puzzler!

186
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:41,703
So let's see
what you got, genius.

187
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:42,987
If I'm murdered tonight,

188
00:06:43,022 --> 00:06:46,140
start the investigation
with those two guys.

189
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,117
The hell you nerds doing here?

190
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:57,835
We're not done talking
about the lockbox.

191
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,986
This isn't over.

192
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,289
And I am here to mediate.

193
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:03,208
You can't just show up
at my door like this.

194
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:04,676
Look, I know we have had
our differences,

195
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,094
but this is very important
to me.

196
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:08,880
And I'm not leaving
until we hash this out.

197
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,098
I respect the moxie, Knope.

198
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:11,549
You can come in for a minute.

199
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,851
Shoes off.
This is a house of respect.

200
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:15,353
Well, I don't need to do that.
My feet are very clean.

201
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:17,388
No shoes, you lose.

202
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,856
"No shoes, you lose"?

203
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:20,942
That means we should have shoes
then, right?

204
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:23,878
No shoes...

205
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:26,264
Hmm.

206
00:07:26,298 --> 00:07:28,950
Yeah, so this is
my weekend dojo.

207
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:31,018
Sorry, the place
is a bit of a mess.

208
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:32,987
My wife's in Oklahoma
for eight months.

209
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:36,140
Maybe forever.
We'll see if she forgives me.

210
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:38,826
- Who's that, Michelle Wie?
- It's not sexual.

211
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,994
I'm just a really big fan
of her game.

212
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:41,579
- Really?
- Yeah.

213
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,631
Because in that picture,
she's wearing a bikini.

214
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,050
Yeah, thanks.
Photoshopped it myself.

215
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:47,051
Fantastic.

216
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:48,052
Well, this is about the time

217
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:49,470
I hit the hay, so...

218
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:51,055
Why don't we all hit the hay?

219
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,640
We'll stay here,
get a good night's sleep,

220
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:54,676
and we can start negotiations
tomorrow.

221
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,145
We stopped at the outlet mall
on the way here.

222
00:07:57,179 --> 00:08:01,015
Got ourselves a sleeping bag,
a giant tin of caramel corn,

223
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:04,319
and an irregular skirt
from DKNY.

224
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:06,053
The hem is crooked,
but it was 8 bucks.

225
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:08,940
The point is, I am not leaving
until I get that lockbox.

226
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:10,358
Oh, playing hardball, huh?

227
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:11,993
Hey, no sweat off my sack.

228
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:13,394
You can take the couch,

229
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,246
if you can get
my exercise equipment

230
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:18,232
out of the way.

231
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,201
I think I can handle it.

232
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,547
How sweet is this table,
by the way, huh?

233
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:31,595
I got it
from an actual benihana.

234
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:34,439
Cost me 4 grand.
Worth every penny.

235
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,440
Hai!

236
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:36,524
Can I interest anyone

237
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:39,377
in an authentic
a-Japanese a-break-a-fast?

238
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:41,813
Scrambled eggs eaten
with chopsticks? Okay.

239
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:43,148
Hai!

240
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:44,732
You know,
maybe we should negotiate

241
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,251
- while we're eating.
- No, what's the rush?

242
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:47,586
Plenty of time for that later.

243
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:50,772
You know what might put you
in the mood to talk is

244
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:52,490
a couple of brewskis

245
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:55,243
and a calendar featuring

246
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,845
some of your favorite
female wrestlers.

247
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,748
Oh, yeah.

248
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:01,449
Knope, you know the way
to a man's heart.

249
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:02,851
Yeah, okay.
Let's talk.

250
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,102
You got it.

251
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:05,787
These people won't leave.

252
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,855
One guy even looked
in the bathroom.

253
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:09,457
Yeah, that means
they like the place.

254
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:11,009
If you just leave them alone,

255
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:12,927
I think we might get
some offers.

256
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:14,195
This evergreen scented candle
should help put people

257
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:15,614
in the mood to buy.

258
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:17,048
You could just open the door

259
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,067
and let the actual smell
of the pines in.

260
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:22,120
Trees are sticky,
and they got bugs in them.

261
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:27,609
This place is so random.

262
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:30,111
I don't know. It's kind of,
like, in the middle of nowhere.

263
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:32,297
I know. That's,
like, the hilarious part.

264
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:34,747
It's like a joke
how long it takes to get here.

265
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,121
It's like a meta-cabin.

266
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,425
- Oh yeah.
- That's what I thought, yeah.

267
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,802
I heard that Dave Eggers
wrote a short story

268
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:42,524
about this tape cassette
that he found

269
00:09:42,558 --> 00:09:43,591
under that tree over there.

270
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,527
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?

271
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:46,894
I'm trying to get
these annoying dumdums

272
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:48,280
to pay more money
for your cabin.

273
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:50,015
Carry on.

274
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,716
Oh, my God, I heard that

275
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,801
Neko Case and Ben Gibbard
made out here once.

276
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:56,288
What?

277
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,757
Saturday at the firm with Ben.

278
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,892
Okay, we dissolve
the loan-out

279
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,243
and file bankruptcy.

280
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:04,613
That way only our clients
have claim to the assets.

281
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:07,048
Great idea...

282
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,034
that we had a month ago.

283
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:11,336
The problem is,
the trust still has claim

284
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,388
to the property.

285
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:16,358
Then we dissolve the trust.

286
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:19,961
Clients "A," "B," and "F,"
they would have to agree,

287
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,047
but if they went for it,
we could arbitrate.

288
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:23,481
He's right.

289
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:26,368
We never thought of that.

290
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:28,503
Oh, oh!
Ben, Ben.

291
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:31,839
Say it again but this time
I'm gonna turn the light on,

292
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,274
like you just had an idea.

293
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:34,642
Sure, sure.
Yeah, I'm with you.

294
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,262
Um, okay.

295
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:40,448
What if we dissolve the trust?

296
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:42,901
Yes!
You just cracked the case.

297
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:44,169
I'm just doing my job.

298
00:10:45,838 --> 00:10:47,138
Okay, here's an idea.

299
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:48,956
Maybe we name part of the park

300
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:50,909
- the "Jamm Zone"?
- Hmm.

301
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,410
Yeah, Jamm could dig on that.

302
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:54,162
How about if in the Jamm zone,

303
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,547
there's no married chicks
allowed?

304
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:56,964
Caution, Jeremy.

305
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:58,183
I think there are people
that will find

306
00:10:58,234 --> 00:10:59,834
the "No Married Chicks" zone

307
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,569
both morally repugnant
and hard to enforce.

308
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:02,587
All right.

309
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,056
Listen, let us celebrate
this progress

310
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:09,627
by sharing
these authentic edamame,

311
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:11,779
or Tokyo beans.

312
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,114
Now I want you
to be very careful

313
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:14,349
about eating these.

314
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,735
You eat the shells,
and you throw the seeds out.

315
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:18,987
Wow. You have really immersed
yourself in Asian culture.

316
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:20,805
Now I think maybe
we should revisit

317
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,090
the holding bond idea.

318
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:23,669
Ugh, Lezzie.
Come on, I'm getting bored.

319
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:25,243
I mean, we've been
at this for hours.

320
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:26,711
Can we please take a break?

321
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:27,746
Perhaps he has a point.

322
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:29,347
And we've made some progress.

323
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:31,332
Maybe we go home and take
the rest of it up on Monday.

324
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,317
No, I cannot wait until Monday.

325
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:33,401
I need to close this deal now.

326
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:34,486
So I have an idea.

327
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:36,270
Let's have a change of venue

328
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:38,406
and keep negotiating
while we have fun.

329
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:40,191
If I remember correctly,
you enjoy

330
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:44,028
the ancient art of karaoke,
yes?

331
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:46,781
I do.
And kudos on that pronunciation.

332
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,050
I remembered
your favorite duet.

333
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,686
Maybe it's time to take
this party to Rydell High.

334
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:53,071
Whoa!

335
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:54,856
I cannot wait to hear
your Travolta.

336
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,875
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm Sandra Dee.

337
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:58,626
That's more of my register.

338
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:01,146

Good news.

353
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:36,181
We have multiple bidders.

354
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:37,916
That guy's getting
his financials together.

355
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,067
Plans on tearing
the whole place down,

356
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:40,652
just wants it for the land.

357
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:43,104
Why would he want to tear down
a perfectly good cabin?

358
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:44,122
I think he's a developer,

359
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:46,707
wants to put in
a luxury glamp-ground.

360
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,443
Glamping is "glamour camping."

361
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,695
Heated tents,
catered meals, wi-fi--

362
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:51,963
You're describing a hotel.

363
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:53,915
And I think we still have
traction with those two.

364
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:55,583
Oh, hey, man.
I love the mustache.

365
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:56,885
So funny.

366
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,386
You ever think about twisting
it up at the ends, huh?

367
00:12:58,404 --> 00:12:59,404
Use a little beeswax?

368
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:01,656
The open house is now closed.

369
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,725
We are not accepting bids
at this time.

370
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,927
The sun sets in 95 minutes.

371
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:08,980
Good day.

372
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:12,450
That's part of the charm
of this whole place--

373
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,369
the cantankerous old coot
who owns it.

374
00:13:14,403 --> 00:13:15,870
It's authentic!

375
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:18,223
I gotta say,
that was pretty fun up there.

376
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:20,825
We have fun
when we collaborate, right?

377
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,745
Working together?
Lockbox, right?

378
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,747
You know, in some weird,
perverted, sexual way,

379
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:27,782
I'm gonna miss you
when you're gone.

380
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:29,818
- Oh.
- You are my Nemesis.

381
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,369
You're the Superman
to my Lex Luthor.

382
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,338
You want to be Lex Luthor?

383
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:36,007
Uh, yeah.
Lex Luthor is rich.

384
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:38,309
Well, okay.
I can't argue with that.

385
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:40,812
So I did Zuko for you.

386
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,463
Now you give me the lockbox.

387
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:44,899
Leslie put a beautiful cross
into the box, Jeremy.

388
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,217
Time for you to head it in.

389
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:47,669
All right, Knope.
What can I say?

390
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:49,137
You wore me down.

391
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:52,190
I will give you my word,
and I will put it in writing,

392
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:53,942
so I can't back out.

393
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:56,644
We won't touch the money
for one year.

394
00:13:56,662 --> 00:13:59,697
And if the economy holds up,
you can start construction then.

395
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:03,868
Leslie, you have your lockbox.

396
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,653
And you scored
a triple dragon on your song.

397
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:07,872
No, I cannot wait a year.

398
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:09,123
I want to get started now.

399
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:10,375
I want construction started
on Monday.

400
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:11,543
You have his word.

401
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:13,628
And this is riddled
with spelling errors,

402
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:15,630
- but it is binding.
- It's not good enough!

403
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:18,433
Jamm, I sang your stupid song,

404
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:20,852
I ate your stupid
fake Asian food,

405
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:22,169
and by the way,
you should know,

406
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:23,504
you don't make sushi rolls
out of tuna salad--

407
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:24,806
Maybe you don't.

408
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,558
I did practically
everything you wanted,

409
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,210
and you won't just give this
to me today?

410
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:29,777
Screw you!

411
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,299
- You're giving a card to me?
- You left me no choice.

412
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:35,650
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Please, could you excuse us?

413
00:14:36,953 --> 00:14:38,823
Leslie, you should be happy!

414
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:41,030
You beat Jamm
in the final battle.

415
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:44,817
Unless there's something more
going on here.

416
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:46,118
Ann.
This is about Ann.

417
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,754
Ann Perkins?
I love Ann Perkins.

418
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:51,157
Pawnee Commons is why
I met Ann five years ago.

419
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,709
And I know you guys are
talking about moving.

420
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:55,428
But I guess I thought
if maybe Ann came back

421
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,030
from Michigan tomorrow,
and I was able to look

422
00:14:57,064 --> 00:15:00,066
into her smoky,
ethnically ambiguous eyes

423
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:01,835
and tell her that we were
breaking ground

424
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:04,470
on a new park,
she might--

425
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,273
- she might want to stay.
- Leslie, I'm sorry.

426
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,059
Ann didn't just go
to Ann arbor to visit family.

427
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,945
She went to sign the lease
on our new home.

428
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,230
Ann arbor sounds disgusting.

429
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:16,115
She already has family there.

430
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,510
And I have a new job lined up
at the University of Michigan.

431
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,904
Go blue!

432
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:22,121
It's a good town.

433
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,623
And it's a great place
to raise a family.

434
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,958
What is great about it?
There's no JJ's Diner there.

435
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:28,060
There's no
"Welcome to Pawnee" sign.

436
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,629
I mean, the stupid state

437
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,047
is split up into two pieces!

438
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:32,048
It's ridiculous.

439
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:33,666
Unexpected play here, Superman.

440
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,385
Not exactly sure
what you're going for,

441
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:36,435
but I dig your Gambit.

442
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:38,504
There is no Gambit here, Jamm.

443
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:41,841
And who sides
with Lex Luthor, by the way?

444
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,776
You probably watch
<i>Million Dollar Baby</i>

445
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:44,777
and root for the stool.

446
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:45,762
I haven't seen it.

447
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:47,680
Not a big Morgan Freeman guy.

448
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:50,099
I find his voice very grating.

449
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,001
I am leaving now.
I am not moving.

450
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:53,202
I'm just going home.

451
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:54,470
Are you guys coming back
to my place?

452
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:56,573
What's--what's--
or are you guys going back to--

453
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:59,125
we wrapping up the weekend?

454
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:01,895
No?

455
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:05,064
♪ Need a cup to perk me up

456
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,200
♪ coffee in the morning

457
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,335
- Surprise!
- Oh, my God!

458
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,405
I hope you don't mind.

459
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,140
We decided to throw you
a pizza party

460
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:16,509
to say congrats
for cracking the case.

461
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,878
Oh, my God, you guys.

462
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,063
See what we got here.

463
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:22,065
Wait a second.
That's not pizza.

464
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:23,249
Those are calzones!

465
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:26,853
- I love calzones!
- We know!

466
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:30,707
I think it's safe to say
I made the right choice.

467
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:31,857
What's up, guys?

468
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:35,428
Hey!

469
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:47,757
BFF slideshow?

470
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,425
You know that
even after we leave Pawnee,

471
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,927
Ann will always be
your best friend.

472
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,579
And it's not that long a trip.

473
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:54,774
Well, it would be even faster

474
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:56,332
if the governor would return
my calls

475
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,251
about my Pawnee-to-Ann arbor
bullet train idea.

476
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,029
You know, I went
to Jamm's with you because

477
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:04,457
I also want to leave
the right kind of legacy,

478
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,592
and that includes
Pawnee commons.

479
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,094
Well, I think
I burned that bridge with Jamm.

480
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:09,529
We're not gonna get
that lockbox.

481
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:12,081
And I am not singing
<i>Beauty School Dropout.</i>

482
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:14,734
It's sexist,
and I don't do slow jams.

483
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:16,185
I have an idea.

484
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:19,271
And I'd like you to consider it

485
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,424
a good-bye gift
from me to you.

486
00:17:23,227 --> 00:17:26,496
No, thank you.
I will let him know.

487
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,164
That was that couple you liked
at the open house.

488
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,465
I despised them.

489
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,684
Well, they just came back
with a new offer

490
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,237
and jacked that shizz up.

491
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,955
Way over asking price.

492
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,408
Ron, who cares who they are?
That's a massive bid.

493
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:39,809
I'ma be a mogul.

494
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:42,628
I bought that cabin
18 years ago for $2,200.

495
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,113
I do not care about the money.

496
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,082
I can't even understand
what you're saying right now.

497
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:48,468
That cabin served
an important purpose for me,

498
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:51,654
as a quiet refuge from
the nonsense of modern life.

499
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:53,305
I'd like the next owners
to understand

500
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,940
and share that purpose.

501
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:58,127
Find me someone like that,
and I'll happily sell.

502
00:17:58,162 --> 00:17:59,429
I'll buy it.

503
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,680
You can't afford that house.

504
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:02,899
Can you afford that house?

505
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,534
What would you use it for?

506
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:08,121
I'd go up there
and take Andy and Champion

507
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:09,872
and just get away
from everyone else

508
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:10,940
and look at spiders.

509
00:18:10,974 --> 00:18:12,658
And it's where I'd bury
the bodies

510
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,444
of that annoying couple
after I murder them.

511
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:15,861
Here's my offer.

512
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:19,599
I will give you everything
in my purse.

513
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:23,436
$8, a bunch
of loose cough drops,

514
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:25,922
and Larry's asthma inhaler.

515
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:27,590
Thank God.
I've been looking for that.

516
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:29,675
Larry, this is part of
a real estate transaction now.

517
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,144
You have no legal claim to it.

518
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,813
Sorry, I had no idea.

519
00:18:33,831 --> 00:18:36,265
This is the best offer
I've heard yet.

520
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,267
Uh, you tripping right now.

521
00:18:38,302 --> 00:18:39,385
Sold.

522
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:40,703
Don't even trip.

523
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:42,021
Your commission.

524
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,925
Thanks a lot.

525
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,960
Your share, mogul.

526
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,512
I'm about to play golf
with a guy

527
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,314
who was almost
on <i>The Apprentice,</i>

528
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:52,548
so this better be good.

529
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,901
You give Leslie her lockbox,

530
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:57,536
and you get me
in your hip pocket.

531
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,088
Starting in my next term
as city manager,

532
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:03,559
I will give you
one huge I.O.U.,

533
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,545
no questions asked.

534
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:06,546
Hmm.

535
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,966
Jamm likes the sound of that.

536
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,102
Let's make it five I.O.U.s,
and you got a deal.

537
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:17,190
You drive a hard bargain,
but you leave me no choice.

538
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:20,076
Fine.
Five huge IOUs.

539
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,227
Deal, guys.

540
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,912
You must really want that park.

541
00:19:22,946 --> 00:19:24,030
I do. Yes.

542
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,249
And to tell you the truth,

543
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:28,284
I'm doing it all
for my best friend.

544
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,436
That's all I wanted to hear.

545
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:33,235
Leslie,
you're my best friend too.

546
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:39,181
Well, vote passed. 3-2.

547
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:41,705
Jamm is gonna be so pissed
when he finds out

548
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:42,531
that you're leaving

549
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:43,891
and your I.O.U.s are worthless.

550
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:45,039
Are you sure you're okay
with what you did?

551
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:47,041
Well, it's not
the most ethical thing

552
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:48,343
that I've ever done,

553
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:50,244
but on the flip side,
Jamm is a big, mean dope.

554
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:51,579
- Mm-hmm.
- And I hope that this eases

555
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:53,398
some of the pain of us
moving away a little bit.

556
00:19:53,432 --> 00:19:54,532
Oh, I'm currently
in deep denial

557
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,850
that that's happening.

558
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:58,136
Speaking of which,
how's the new gig coming?

559
00:19:58,187 --> 00:19:59,187
Well, I got a raise,

560
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:00,855
and my fridge is full
of calzones,

561
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,256
so not complaining.

562
00:20:02,274 --> 00:20:03,641
The reason I ask is
this town is gonna need

563
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:05,092
a new city manager.

564
00:20:05,111 --> 00:20:06,478
And I've talked to some people,

565
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:09,697
and you have the votes
if you want the job.

566
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:11,816
Wh--

567
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:12,901
Seriously?

568
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:13,935
Is this for realskis?

569
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:16,905
This is 100% certified
for realskis.

570
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:19,457
- What do you say?
- I mean, I--wow.

571
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:21,409
I would be insane to say no.

572
00:20:21,443 --> 00:20:22,944
Oh, no.

573
00:20:24,914 --> 00:20:26,548
Wyatt, you're late.

574
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,919
I'm just kidding,
you can do whatever you want.

575
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:33,087
Actually, Barney,

576
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:36,124
I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

577
00:20:36,158 --> 00:20:38,042
Today's my last day.

578
00:20:38,077 --> 00:20:40,295
I got an opportunity
I couldn't say no to,

579
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:42,464
and I have to quit.
Again.

580
00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:45,550
No need to explain.

581
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:48,169
I knew it was too good
to be true.

582
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:51,556
Oh, I do have
a little going-away gift.

583
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,925
Left it in the break room.

584
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:56,427
If anyone could appreciate it,
it's you guys.

585
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:58,980
"You can play with one warrior,

586
00:20:59,014 --> 00:21:00,715
"but it's just
not nearly as good.

587
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:03,268
Enjoy.
Ben Wyatt."

588
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,269
Let's play.

589
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,053
- I call ledgerman!
- No.

590
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:12,619
