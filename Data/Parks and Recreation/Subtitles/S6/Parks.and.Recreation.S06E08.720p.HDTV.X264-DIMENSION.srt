1
00:00:00,863 --> 00:00:03,938
We're gonna have some fun tonight, Pawnee!
[All cheering]

2
00:00:04,122 --> 00:00:06,606
Who is ready to play 60?

3
00:00:06,657 --> 00:00:07,924
Everybody on the field!

4
00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:10,127
Yeah!

5
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:13,174
The NFL has a campaign
to try to get kids active

6
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:14,511
for 60 minutes per day.

7
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:15,946
And so we bused in

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,931
a hundred lucky,
little buggers from Pawnee.

9
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:20,517
And they are gonna get a chance
to play with the Colts.

10
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:22,302
Oh! Come on, Reggie!

11
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:23,616
I told you to run a button hook.

12
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:24,821
- I did, Leslie.
- Okay.

13
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:25,956
I guess you would know.

14
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,874
A pleasure to see you again,
Mr. Luck.

15
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:29,125
We met briefly last year

16
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:31,678
- at our friend's bachelor party.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

17
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:32,863
How are you?

18
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:34,080
I normally don't answer
that question,

19
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:35,699
but since I respect
your talent,

20
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,117
I will tell you--
I am fine.

21
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:39,102
Hi, I'm April.

22
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:43,356
I stole your wallet.

23
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,724
You guys are weird.

24
00:00:44,742 --> 00:00:46,960
Thank you.

25
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:47,961
What's up, girl?

26
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:50,296
Keep walking, 98.

27
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:52,115
You don't even want to talk
to that guy?

28
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:54,601
- He plays for the NFL.
- He's a linebacker.

29
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:58,221
Skill positions only
for Donna Meagle.

30
00:00:58,256 --> 00:00:59,505
I got my Colts beanie,

31
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:00,473
my Colts scarf,

32
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:01,892
I got the Colts grill going,

33
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:04,411
and the crowning glory--
Colts slippies.

34
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:06,162
How are you going
to run in those?

35
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:08,915
[Laughing]
"Run"? Tommy doesn't run.

36
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:10,217
That's your guys' job.

37
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:13,320
Now, uh, let's go fetch
this football throw, fellas.

38
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:16,957
I love sports.

39
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:19,926
[Triumphant music]

40
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:30,839

41
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,763
Check it out, Tom--
the Eagleton reservoir.

42
00:01:39,797 --> 00:01:40,830
Isn't it stunning?

43
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:42,082
It's just a big dumb pond.

44
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:43,700
This morning I saw
a YouTube clip

45
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:45,335
of a little puppy riding
a motorcycle.

46
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:47,103
So my bar for "stunning"
is pretty high.

47
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:49,889
What if I told you that
this water has fluoride in it?

48
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:51,908
Then I would tell you
the puppy had a little side car

49
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:53,693
with a piggy in it
named Hampton.

50
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:55,912
First of all,
send me a link to that video.

51
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:58,131
But more importantly,
now that we have access

52
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:00,767
to the Eagleton reservoir
and the water-treatment supply,

53
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:02,769
Pawnee is going to have fluoride
in its water

54
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:04,554
for the first time
in our history,

55
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:06,139
our oral history.

56
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,440
Nailed it.

57
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:09,515
Of course I'm upset
that I lost the recall election.

58
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:12,078
But I'm just gonna spend
the remainder of my term

59
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:14,848
cramming in as many
good projects as I can.

60
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:17,183
Lame duck?
Try flame duck...

61
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:20,086
'cause this duck is on fire.

62
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:21,538
It's hard doing
stupid government stuff

63
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,006
now that Rent-a-Swag's closed.

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,874
I'm a businessman.
That's what I was born to do.

65
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:27,093
Well, look, you just got
to make the most of the job

66
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:28,561
that you have.

67
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:30,263
Like, take that trash collector.

68
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:31,998
It's not the most glamorous job
in the world,

69
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,917
but he's doing it
with a smile on his face.

70
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:35,669
Oh, my God.

71
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:37,971
He's not wearing any pants.
What's wrong with him?

72
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:39,806
- Let's get out of here.
- He's smiling at us!

73
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:41,908
- Let's go! Run!
- [Whimpering]

74
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:43,910
What's so exciting, everyone?

75
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:45,762
Look what Ron made.
It's amazing.

76
00:02:45,813 --> 00:02:47,847
Several months ago,
I was on a walk

77
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:49,666
and found my crib tree.

78
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,152
I approached the tree,
murdered it,

79
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:54,087
left it to cure in my woodshop,

80
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:55,722
and have begun working it
into a crib

81
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,407
for my upcoming child.

82
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:00,243
Ron Swanson,
you cannot use this crib.

83
00:03:00,294 --> 00:03:02,545
You're ignoring every known
crib-safety standard.

84
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:04,264
It's all covered in
the parenting book I'm reading.

85
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:06,333
Are you going to crawl my way?
By Lenny Kravitz.

86
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,668
My crib will be safe
because I'm building it

87
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:10,120
with my own two hands.

88
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:11,588
I bought my crib
in Bloomington,

89
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,190
and I am confident
that it is literally

90
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:16,443
the safest crib
in the explored universe.

91
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:17,444
Let me take you there,

92
00:03:17,478 --> 00:03:18,928
and you can talk
to the salesperson.

93
00:03:18,963 --> 00:03:20,096
Counteroffer--

94
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:22,265
you take me nowhere,
and I talk to no one.

95
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:23,350
Counter-counteroffer--

96
00:03:23,384 --> 00:03:24,984
you come with me,
or I make you attend

97
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,986
a four-hour fax cover-sheet
protocol meeting.

98
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:29,806
Either way, it's a win for me.

99
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,776
Next on the docket is
a vote to approve

100
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,861
the Pawnee-Eagleton
reservoir merger.

101
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:36,246
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

102
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,332
We're just goosing our
water supply with fluoride?

103
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:40,666
I mean, come on.

104
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:42,652
Are we really gonna force
every Pawnee resident

105
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:45,438
to ingest a chemical
we know nothing about?

106
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:47,573
Fluoride is used
by the communists

107
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,075
to control our minds.

108
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:50,543
No, it's not.

109
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,861
Fluoride can control minds?

110
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:54,831
Like, you can use it
to make ladies do stuff?

111
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:56,545
How am I the one
that is getting booted off

112
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,467
of this city council?

113
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:59,419
Okay, fluoride is safe,

114
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:00,720
it is good for you,

115
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:03,940
and almost every town
in America uses it.

116
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:05,141
Ah, all right.

117
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:06,376
You got me.

118
00:04:06,427 --> 00:04:07,877
I don't want fluoride
in the water

119
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:10,480
because I'm a dentist,
and I like cavities.

120
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:11,948
Yeah, that is not
a valid reason.

121
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:13,232
Pawnee's cavity problem

122
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,051
is why a small-town dentist,

123
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:19,139
like me, can afford
such a boss ride.

124
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:21,491
Got an Asian girl
to sit in it once.

125
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:23,760
Why did we come out here?

126
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:25,244
Come on, Jamm.

127
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:27,313
Fluoride in the water--
it's a no-brainer.

128
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:28,681
Can't you just let me
have this one?

129
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:30,016
No can do, Knopey.

130
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:32,118
As a matter of fact,
I would like to propose

131
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:34,838
my own bill--
the Pawnee Clean Water Bill,

132
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:37,307
which prohibits adding anything

133
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:40,092
to our water supply forever.

134
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:41,895
Jamm's not going to be able

135
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:44,297
to kill this reservoir merger,
is he?

136
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:46,866
On my side, I have facts,
science, and reason.

137
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:48,334
All he has
is fear-mongering.

138
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:50,236
Oh, my God, he's gonna win.

139
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:52,638
Yeah, people get jittery
about stuff like this.

140
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:54,791
Remember last year
when no one would get flu shots

141
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:57,210
'cause there was a rumor
they turned you European?

142
00:04:57,244 --> 00:04:58,711
Well,
I'll figure something out.

143
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:00,146
Oh, Jessica's here.
I better go.

144
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:02,015
- Okay, bye.
- Hey, sugar butt.

145
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:05,652
Some lardos in Muncie ate
tainted Sweetums toffee sticks

146
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:08,471
and diarrhea'd so much,
they ended up in the hospital.

147
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:09,472
Ugh.

148
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:10,640
Can we give their school,

149
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:12,592
like, a new seesaw
or something?

150
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,593
Yeah.

151
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,728
Thanks.

152
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:18,164
The new site looks good.
Nice work.

153
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,233
Oh, my God.
These dogs are so cute.

154
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,168
I want to throw up
and kill myself.

155
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:25,438
Animal control had to take in
all the pets from Eagleton.

156
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,657
And Crazy Craig used to run
all their shelters,

157
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,542
so he helped me make
an adoption website

158
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:30,576
for all the dogs.

159
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:31,878
If you can look at that site

160
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,217
and not want to take home
50 dogs,

161
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,932
you're basically
a war criminal.

162
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:37,033
[Groans]

163
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,034
See the way that dog

164
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:39,318
is rolling around in a puddle?

165
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:41,588
That's something Andy does
when he gets hot.

166
00:05:41,622 --> 00:05:42,955
Oh, my God, you're right.

167
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:44,023
That is so Andy.

168
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:45,424
Oh, my God.
That dog is totally...

169
00:05:45,442 --> 00:05:46,776
Both: Tom!

170
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,027
I don't know why.
It doesn't look like him.

171
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:49,462
But it just is.

172
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:50,863
It's like the dog is
the essence of Tom.

173
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:52,382
[Gasps]
Okay, important meeting

174
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:53,800
in the conference room
right now.

175
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:56,335
We are going to all pick
our spirit dogs.

176
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:57,987
Oh, I've got to pick up Gayle

00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:00,425
Look, we all love T-dazzle.

355
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,428
But we can do more to improve
our drinking supply.

356
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:06,514
Sweetums is excited
to propose an alternative

357
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:08,900
to boring municipal water.

358
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:11,369
We call it "Drink-ems"!

359
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,454
Whoo!

360
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:14,422
Sweetums is prepared
to take over

361
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:16,057
the management
of Pawnee's water.

362
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:18,977
This is gonna save this town
beaucoup bucks.

363
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:21,646
Take a sip
of this delicious water

364
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:24,249
and imagine it coming
out of your faucets at home.

365
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:26,251
This water is filled
with sugar.

366
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:31,005
There's absolutely no way
we are doing this.

367
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:32,941
Checkmate.

368
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:34,860
Did you bring those with you
just to do that?

369
00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:36,361
- Maybe.
- Damn.

370
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:37,645
It is a baller move.

371
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:40,782
What are we gonna do now,
Leslie?

372
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,167
Hey.

373
00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:44,352
Okay, are you still mad at me
about the poodle thing?

374
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:45,437
It was just a dumb game.

375
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:46,805
I can pick another dog.

376
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:48,556
I'm not mad about the choice.

377
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:50,358
I'm mad about your reasons.

378
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:53,194
"Pretty," "makeup"--
is that all you know about me?

379
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:55,163
We don't hang out that much.

380
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:57,165
It's not like you know
a ton about me.

381
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:59,634
You're beautiful,
yet cold and aloof.

382
00:12:59,668 --> 00:13:01,853
You pride yourself
on being a loner.

383
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:04,138
You do not obey,
you choose to cooperate.

384
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:05,857
And when you stop baring
your fangs to pick a mate,

385
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:07,075
it's for life.

386
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:08,844
And you're fiercely loyal
to your pack,

387
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:12,797
which makes you
a rare black Siberian husky.

388
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:15,617
That was so spot-on,
it was scary.

389
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:17,969
I need to go lie down
for 45 minutes.

390
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,189
No, an hour...

391
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:22,858
a full hour.

392
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:24,309
Good morning.

393
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,861
This won't take long.

394
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:28,563
Simply put, it would be madness

395
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,448
to let Sweetums take over
our water supply

396
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:31,599
and pump it full of sugar.

397
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:33,151
What's next--

398
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:34,936
cookie dough toothpaste?

399
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:37,489
Bad example.
That would be amazing.

400
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,909
My point is, Sweetums is an
evil, profit-hungry corporation

401
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:42,160
that is ruining our health.

402
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:43,995
Ever since Sweetums
opened its doors,

403
00:13:44,046 --> 00:13:46,114
obesity is up 100%.

404
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:47,799
It's unacceptable.

405
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,286
Down with that poison-peddling
corporate monster.

406
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:53,388
Down with Sweetums!

407
00:13:53,422 --> 00:13:54,956
[Reporters chattering]

408
00:13:56,392 --> 00:13:57,475
- Hey.
- Hey.

409
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,030
Heard about your speech.
Sounded great.

410
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:01,680
I wish you could've seen it.
It felt so good.

411
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:03,515
I love loose cannon-ing.

412
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:05,967
You know, I love the power
of no consequences.

413
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:08,636
Well, unfortunately,
there has been one consequence.

414
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:12,274
I just got fired from Sweetums.

415
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:15,110
Because you were embezzling...

416
00:14:15,144 --> 00:14:16,328
I hope.

417
00:14:18,714 --> 00:14:20,708
Hey, Jessica!

418
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:22,251
Did you do something
to your hair?

419
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:25,237
Because, sister,
you look good enough to eat.

420
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:26,272
Num num num num num.

421
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,023
What do you want, Leslie?

422
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,425
You can't punish Ben
for something I did.

423
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,459
It's not fair.

424
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,511
I love him,
and I will do anything

425
00:14:32,562 --> 00:14:34,146
to help him get his job back.

426
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:35,314
What do you want?

427
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:38,084
I want you
to formally apologize

428
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,719
for what
you said about Sweetums.

429
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,071
I want you to say
that we're a moral,

430
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:46,258
upstanding corporation that
you're proud to have in Pawnee.

431
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:48,177
And when you make your apology,

432
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:51,480
I want you to wear
a lime-green pantsuit

433
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:53,215
because it will look horrible
on you.

434
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,801
You are such an autumn.

435
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,419
Did you need me for something?

436
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,605
Yes, I want to figure out
your spirit dog,

437
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:00,873
and I'm going to do that

438
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:02,792
by learning everything there is
to know about you.

439
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:05,094
All right. Game on.

440
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:06,896
Okay, what's
your favorite color?

441
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,898
For cars, it's gold.
For shoes, it's red--

442
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:11,100
unless it's the weekend,
then reverse them.

443
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,170
- Favorite music?
- 1970s funk and 1770s opera

444
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,555
and Sugar Ray,
post Mark McGrath

445
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,890
after he left
for <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

446
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:19,525
- Favorite book?
- <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

447
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:22,328
- That's not a--
- <i>Downton...Abbey.</i>

448
00:15:22,362 --> 00:15:23,295
Okay.

449
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,631
Um, describe
your perfect Sunday.

450
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:26,882
Church,

451
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:27,933
do the <i>Harper's Magazine</i>
<i>Acrostic,</i>

452
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,435
play my oboe in the jacuzzi

453
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:31,153
while the sun sets
over puget sound.

454
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:32,254
Favorite movies?

455
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:33,529
In order--
<i>Natural Born Killers,</i>

456
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,707
<i>Remains of the Day,</i>

457
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:37,126
and <i>Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.</i>

458
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,095
Excellent.

459
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:40,730
Thank you very much
for your time.

460
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:43,833
I will have
your answer shortly.

461
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:46,519
No idea.

462
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:48,888
If a joint is
properly fashioned,

463
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:51,673
all you need to do
is guide it into place.

464
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:55,361
"All you need to do
is guide it into place."

465
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,413
What I get from that is,
when parenting,

466
00:15:57,447 --> 00:15:59,749
sometimes a subtle hand
is more effective

467
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:01,384
than a strong one.

468
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,885
This is already
so much more helpful

469
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,770
than the last book
on parenting I read--

470
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:08,457
<i>Rad Dads</i> by Apolo Anton Ohno
and Shaun White.

471
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:11,177
Nah.

472
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,295
Ron, why did you throw
that wood away?

473
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:14,763
It's unstable.
It's no good.

474
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:16,231
I just don't understand

475
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:18,233
"the throwing away the wood"
metaphor.

476
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:19,701
What's the lesson?

477
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:22,088
Oh, I know!
It's potty-training.

478
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,706
That trash can is the toilet,
and the wood was the feces.

479
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:26,692
Chris, I'm not teaching you
anything.

480
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:28,027
We're just building a crib.

481
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:29,278
No, I know you're not

482
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:30,863
consciously teaching me
anything.

483
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:32,348
I'm trying to siphon off

484
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:34,350
some of your calm,
centered wisdom

485
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:35,384
through metaphors.

486
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:36,385
Metaphors?

487
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:37,820
I hate metaphors.

488
00:16:37,854 --> 00:16:39,822
That's why my favorite book is
<i>Moby Dick--</i>

489
00:16:39,856 --> 00:16:41,907
no froufrou symbolism,

490
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:44,993
just a good, simple tale
about a man who hates an animal.

491
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:49,315
That's enough for today,
I think.

492
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:53,752
- An organized child is a--
- No.

493
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:56,422
[Sighs] Okay, I've been
working on this for three hours,

494
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,858
and I know your spirit dog.

495
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,861
You are a Nova Scotia toller,

496
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,998
because you're
outgoing and adventurous.

497
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,851
And you love Canada?

498
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:11,253
- No, that's not right.
- No, it isn't.

499
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:12,605
But I appreciate the effort.

500
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:13,606
We're good.

501
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,990
And don't beat yourself up.

502
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:17,159
You'll probably never guess
what kind of dog I am.

503
00:17:17,194 --> 00:17:19,475
You're right. I'll never guess
what kind of dog you are,

504
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,696
because you're not a dog.

505
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:21,764
You're a cat.

506
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:23,516
You're temperamental.

507
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,852
You're unpredictable, complex,
and hard to read.

508
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:29,655
You make people work
before you let them in.

509
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:32,458
But if they put the time in
and prove that they care,

510
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:34,143
then you open yourself up
to them.

511
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:36,128
Right?

512
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:41,383
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

513
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:44,170
Hmm.
[Purrs]

514
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:46,205
"So let's all raise a glass,

515
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,541
"full of delicious,
sugary drinking water,

516
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:51,193
to Sweetums--
a Pawnee Institution."

517
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:52,928
Leslie, don't do this.

518
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:55,848
I have to, Ben.
We can't both be out of a job.

519
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:58,050
What will we do--
sleep all day,

520
00:17:58,101 --> 00:17:59,718
take cooking classes together,

521
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:02,188
sit on a couch
and watch movies?

522
00:18:02,222 --> 00:18:04,840
- God, that sounds horrible.
- There's more at stake here.

523
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:07,142
I mean, you apologize,
it'll be an endorsement

524
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:08,694
- for the Drink-ems plan.
- I know that, but--

525
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:11,363
And everything you said
about Sweetums was right on.

526
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:14,033
I mean, 90%
of the charity work I did

527
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:16,402
was to compensate
for messes they caused.

528
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:18,904
And I don't want to work
for them anymore.

529
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:20,139
Are you sure?

530
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:22,958
Yeah, just go up there,
stick to your guns.

531
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:24,293
It's not gonna make
a difference.

532
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:25,377
I can't beat them.

533
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:27,713
All I have on my side is
facts and science,

534
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:29,832
and people hate
facts and science.

535
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:32,001
Wait.
I have an idea.

536
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:34,253
Go get Tom.
Run! Get Tom!

537
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:38,537
Yesterday I said some pretty harsh things

538
00:18:38,657 --> 00:18:41,826
about Sweetums
and their great new product.

539
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:43,397
But when I looked
at the research,

540
00:18:43,431 --> 00:18:46,199
I found some pretty compelling
facts about Drink-ems

541
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:48,035
that made me change my tune.

542
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:50,988
Each Drink-ems is packed
with 35%

543
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:54,041
of your daily monopotassium
phosphate requirement.

544
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:58,328
MPP is an emulsifier as well
as a plus-7 PH buffer.

545
00:18:58,379 --> 00:18:59,880
Now, I know
what you're thinking--

546
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:01,048
what about its molar mass?

547
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:04,251
How does 136.086 grab you?

548
00:19:04,285 --> 00:19:06,837
[Hip-hop beat]
What the--

549
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:08,805
I don't know about y'all,

550
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,674
but Drink-ems seems
pretty boring to me,

551
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:13,226
not like H-2-flow.

552
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:14,511
Excuse me.

553
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:16,296
I have several binders
with very important data

554
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:17,597
that I need to get through.

555
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,271
Well, miss, I think
we'd all appreciate it

556
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,184
if you just swallowed
a teaspoon of hush.

557
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:24,071
Think of H-2-flow
as an app for your teeth.

558
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:27,190
The more flow you take in,
the more sparkle points you get.

559
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:28,525
Get enough sparkle points,

560
00:19:28,576 --> 00:19:30,193
and you're on your way
to your first aqua badge!

561
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:31,611
Collect enough aqua badges,

562
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:36,533
and we'll welcome you
to the H-2-flow Platinum Club.

563
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:39,086
I'm great at business,
and I'm great at parks stuff.

564
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,921
I'm like Picasso meets
Michael Jordan.

565
00:19:40,955 --> 00:19:42,122
I can paint,

566
00:19:42,156 --> 00:19:45,092
but, uh, I can also be
a world-class gambler.

567
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:47,044
Ron, what's this?

568
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:48,879
The crib I built.

569
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,597
I'm giving it to you and Ann.

570
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:51,815
It's perfectly safe.

571
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:54,317
I tested it by hitting it
with my truck.

572
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:55,635
Well, Ron, I can't accept.

573
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:57,337
This is for your baby.

574
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:59,156
There's more than
one crib tree in a forest.

575
00:19:59,173 --> 00:20:00,673
That's not a lesson,
by the way,

576
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:03,310
just a comment
on lumber availability.

577
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:05,845
It's beautiful.
Thank you.

578
00:20:05,863 --> 00:20:07,864
Nobody has
all the right answers

579
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:09,516
in parenting, including me.

580
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:11,318
And that toxic crib you bought

581
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:12,953
won't be the last mistake
you make.

582
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:14,521
But a man who's this worried

583
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:16,323
about making
all the right choices

584
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:17,958
cares very much.

585
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:19,859
That's all that matters.

586
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:21,962
You'll be a great father.

587
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:23,296
Thank you, Ron...

588
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:25,132
for the crib and the advice.

589
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:28,201
It's much better
than any metaphor.

590
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:30,921
Does the white whale
actually symbolize

591
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:33,340
the unknowability
and meaninglessness

592
00:20:33,374 --> 00:20:35,258
of human existence?

593
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:37,094
[Chuckles] No.

594
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:39,479
It's just a [bleep] fish.

595
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:41,398
Hey, good news.

596
00:20:41,432 --> 00:20:42,549
Drink-ems is dead.

597
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,784
As of tomorrow,
every Pawnee resident

598
00:20:44,802 --> 00:20:47,220
will have H-2-flow
in their drinking water.

599
00:20:47,255 --> 00:20:48,288
That's great news.

600
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:50,424
H-2-flow is fluoride, right?

601
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,476
I think so.

602
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,562
I'll double-check with Tom,
but I'm, like, 95% sure.

603
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:56,763
Wow.
Look at us.

604
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,316
Two people, who are about
to have zero jobs.

605
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,400
Weird, huh?

606
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:01,435
And you and I--

607
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,403
we always land
on our feet, right?

608
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:04,905
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh!

609
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:07,691
Guess who won
that plain blue T-shirt?

610
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:08,859
No way!

611
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,976
Look how blue it is.

612
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:11,596
Wow. Things are
already looking up.

613
00:21:11,716 --> 00:21:13,119
Yeah!

614
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,159
