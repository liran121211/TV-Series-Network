1
00:00:00,832 --> 00:00:04,362
This is a historic day.
At 12:01 this morning,

2
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:06,200
the city of Eagleton
ceased to exist

3
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:08,252
and was re-absorbed
back into Pawnee.

4
00:00:08,286 --> 00:00:10,087
Things are exactly
the way they were

5
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:12,105
back in 1817, except, you know,

6
00:00:12,157 --> 00:00:13,740
women and minorities can vote,

7
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:15,259
we have indoor toilets,

8
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:18,228
and we no longer burn widows
for learning arithmetic.

9
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:20,814
Councilwoman Knope
is your merger czar,

10
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:22,466
and in the binders
that she's provided,

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,302
you will find directions
to your department in Pawnee

12
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:27,905
that most closely matches
your department in Eagleton.

13
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:29,239
There are two
Eagleton departments

14
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:30,257
Pawnee does not have:

15
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,110
the Department
of Infinity Pool Design

16
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:34,778
and the Department of Dressage,

17
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:37,247
which I am told is
a fancy horse-riding thing.

18
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:39,833
It is horse-dancing, madam.

19
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:41,484
Okay, take it easy, Alonzo.

20
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:44,287
All you horse dancing people,
sit in your saddles if you will.

21
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:46,723
The rest of you,
welcome to your new departments.

22
00:00:46,757 --> 00:00:50,010
Attention: Eagleton is
now under martial law.

23
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:51,011
No.

24
00:00:53,982 --> 00:01:04,919
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

25
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:12,332
Okay, Pawnee Parks Department.

26
00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:14,417
Soon, you will be paired up
with a person

27
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:16,720
who was roughly
your equivalent in Eagleton.

28
00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:18,705
Donna, you'll be with Craig.

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,174
April, you'll be with someone
named Tynnyfer.

30
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:23,510
And Ron, your guy is
also named Ron.

31
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:25,762
Guess there's
no Tom Haverford equivalent.

32
00:01:25,797 --> 00:01:27,714
Not surprised,
I'm one of a kind,

33
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:29,132
just like the custom Nikes
I designed

34
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,852
that say "Tommy's Tootsies"
across the toes.

35
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:33,203
You do have
a counterpart, actually.

36
00:01:33,237 --> 00:01:35,505
His name is Eric,
and I've heard he's amazing.

37
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,591
Anyway, I also have
a little surprise.

38
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:39,860
I would like to introduce
our new filing temp.

39
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:41,995
- Hey, everybody.
- No!

40
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:43,981
No, why?
This can't be happening.

41
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:45,365
Why, Leslie?

42
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,284
We brought Jerry
out of retirement

43
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:49,253
because we have a mountain
of filing to get through.

44
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:51,605
- Welcome back, Jerry Gergic.
- Thank you, Leslie.

45
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:53,323
And as long
as we're starting out fresh,

46
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:54,675
Leslie, I was wondering
if people

47
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:56,159
would call me by my real name.

48
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:58,145
- Larry?
- No, it's not Larry.

49
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:00,163
It's Jerry.
No, it's Gary.

50
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:02,249
Your name is Larry,
Larry Gengurch.

51
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:03,650
His name is Larry Gengurch.

52
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:05,102
Come on, April,
it's already hard enough

53
00:02:05,136 --> 00:02:07,738
for my family
when you call me "Gary."

54
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:09,539
- Jerry.
- Ha, ha, classic Larry.

55
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:11,808
Larry.

56
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:13,760
- Larry, Larry, Larry.
- Aw, jeez.

57
00:02:13,795 --> 00:02:16,413
Look, I'm trying to save
as many jobs as possible,

58
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:18,348
but we're gonna have to
lose some people.

59
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:19,933
I'm not sure
who we should keep.

60
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:21,902
April, Tom and Donna are three
of the best human beings

61
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,287
that have ever lived.

62
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:26,773
Ron is basically a better
version of George Washington.

63
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:31,495
But...the Eagletonians
are probably good too.

64
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:34,264
Today, we are not just
merging two towns.

65
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:36,650
We're throwing
a birthday party for a new city.

66
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:41,888
Happy birthday, New Pawnee.

67
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:43,357
Party's over.

68
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:46,376
You guys lost millions
of taxpayer dollars,

69
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,229
and we have to clean up
the obscene mess you've made.

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,281
You're not as nice
as the other guy.

71
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:53,250
I don't care.

72
00:02:53,284 --> 00:02:56,269
When we were state auditors,
we had an amazing system.

73
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:58,105
Yeah, Chris pumped everyone up

74
00:02:58,156 --> 00:02:59,840
and made them feel positive
and happy.

75
00:02:59,874 --> 00:03:03,160
And I swooped in and slashed
their budgets to ribbons.

76
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:04,911
Like a majestic alley-oop.

77
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:07,247
You're all amazing!

78
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:09,182
You're all fired.

79
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:10,817
Teamwork.

80
00:03:10,852 --> 00:03:12,903
Hi, you've reached
the voicemail

81
00:03:12,937 --> 00:03:16,139
of Larry Gengurch.

82
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:18,775
Please leave your message
after the tone.

83
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,443
Well, when Leslie called
to see if I could help,

84
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:23,380
Gayle and I were just getting
on a cruise ship

85
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:24,948
to the Bahamas.

86
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:26,783
I said, "Gayle, put that
bikini away,

87
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:28,852
because Pawnee needs me."

88
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:33,106
Oh ho! Somebody forgot
a banana in here--ooh!

89
00:03:33,157 --> 00:03:34,791
Hi, I'm Donna.

90
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:36,209
Oh, that is the perfect
name for you.

91
00:03:36,244 --> 00:03:37,928
I love it.
Never change it!

92
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:41,097
Wasn't gonna.
You're Craig, right?

93
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:43,417
Ugh, yes, but I hate that name.

94
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:45,502
It's so boring.
Sounds like someone's cousin.

95
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,887
Craig! Craig!

96
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:48,605
I want to be a Spanish man
named Terrence,

97
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,457
but that didn't happen.

98
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:54,695
Okay. So here's
my list of duties.

99
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:56,913
I'm basically
the office manager.

100
00:03:56,948 --> 00:03:59,299
- How about you?
- Oh, I did everything.

101
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,567
Everything!

102
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:01,818
I carried the Eagleton
department on my shoulders

103
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:03,403
for years, and I loved
every second of it.

104
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:06,289
You don't even know!

105
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:07,707
I'm sorry,
was your name Jennifer?

106
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:10,444
No, it's Tynnyffer with two y's.

107
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:12,379
I used to be Jennifer,
but then I decided

108
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,981
to rebrand myself.

109
00:04:15,032 --> 00:04:17,250
Oh, wait, hang on.
It's Xanax o'clock.

110
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:24,541
Um, well, nice to meet you.

111
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:25,909
My name's April,

112
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:29,446
and I just wanted to say
that your dress is so cute

113
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,564
it's bonks.

114
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:32,282
I saw my spinning
instructor wearing it,

115
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:34,501
and I was like, "Shut up.
Where do I get that?"

116
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,295
Oh, my God.
Who's your spinning instructor?

117
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:37,771
Gregory or Wynona?

118
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:40,190
I go to Yonis.
Who are Gregory and Wynona?

119
00:04:40,224 --> 00:04:41,157
I've never
heard of them before.

120
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:44,127
- Are they better?
- Wynona rocks my world.

121
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:45,779
Seriously, you need
to get me in there.

122
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:48,281
Like, that's a must,
must, must.

123
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:50,667
She's the worst person
I've ever met.

124
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:52,853
I want to travel
the world with her.

125
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:55,255
Ron.

126
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:58,024
Ron.

127
00:04:58,059 --> 00:04:59,375
Last name?

128
00:04:59,393 --> 00:05:00,977
Dunne.

129
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:02,746
Is that your name,

130
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,914
or are you telling me
you're finished talking?

131
00:05:04,932 --> 00:05:07,768
Both.

132
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,319
Dunne and done.

133
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,092
I like Ron.

134
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,161
- Hi.
- Well, well, well.

135
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:19,296
You must be Eric.

136
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,632
I'm Ragiv from I.T.
This is E.R.I.C.

137
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,568
E.R.I.C. is
a computer program?

138
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:27,270
Stands for Eagleton
Reservation Information Center.

139
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:29,039
It does all the scheduling
in Eagleton.

140
00:05:29,073 --> 00:05:30,457
I'm here to install it.

141
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:32,709
But scheduling's
the main part of my job.

142
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:33,827
You still have a human being

143
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:35,311
in charge of booking
tennis courts?

144
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:37,580
What is this, 1990?

145
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:39,182
I guess that explains
the shoulder pads.

146
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:46,556
How did he notice these?

147
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:49,342
Hey, this is a surprise.

148
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:51,695
Yeah, I just wanted to
chat for a sec.

149
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:54,164
You know, just so you could
hear some things from me.

150
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:56,032
Verbal things from my mouth.

151
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:57,384
Did that sound weird?

152
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,686
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

153
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,987
First of all, this is Evelyn.

154
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:02,606
Oh, hello.

155
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,125
She is my Health Department
counterpart from Eagleton.

156
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:06,993
There really wasn't a ton
of work for me there.

157
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:08,812
Eagletonians are very healthy.

158
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:10,146
Oh, well, this might be

159
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,814
a very interesting challenge
for you,

160
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,166
because Pawnee has the very
first documented case

161
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:14,918
of mega-diabetes.

162
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:17,086
And the only know occurrence

163
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:19,105
of Lou Gehrig's other disease.

164
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,924
We've been written about
in textbooks.

165
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:22,659
Thanks, Evelyn, I'll
see you back in my office.

166
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:25,996
I just need to talk some more
words into Leslie's face.

167
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,465
Nice to meet you.
Ahem.

168
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:29,933
Wow. I feel sorry for her.

169
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:31,935
I mean, nobody can fill
your shoes, Ann.

170
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:33,603
With your tiny
little doll feet.

171
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:35,655
Actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

172
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:38,708
I, uh, I'm gonna step down,

173
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:41,077
and I'm gonna turn my job
over to Evelyn.

174
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:42,162
What? No.

175
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:43,663
Did somebody
put you up to this?

176
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:46,115
Was it Evelyn?
I knew she was a monster.

177
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:47,217
No.
No, no, no.

178
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:48,919
Chris and I have been talking,

179
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:51,304
and we are thinking
very seriously

180
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:52,973
about leaving Pawnee

181
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:56,092
and moving somewhere else
to start our family--

182
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:58,728
Oh, my God, look at that.
It's waffles!

183
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:01,147
- Delicious waffles.
- Wait.

184
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:03,066
Should we try?
Yeah, let's try.

185
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,351
- Huh?
- Mmm.

186
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:05,902
- Wait, what were you saying?
- Try.

187
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:09,856
Just enjoy. Yeah.
There we go.

188
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:13,263
So, if I'm hearing you correctly,

189
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,414
you're telling me you're not
thinking about leaving Pawnee.

190
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,177
I am thinking about leaving.

191
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:19,715
Is this one of those classic
Ann "not" jokes?

192
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:21,483
Like, "I'm leaving
Pawnee...not!"

193
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:22,337
I don't do that.

194
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:23,724
I was hoping
that you had started.

195
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:24,858
It's not definite.

196
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:26,359
It's just neither of us
are from Pawnee.

197
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:29,475
And I have a whole family
in Michigan.

198
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:32,114
And Chris is missing life
in a bigger city.

199
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:33,965
And I just wanted...

200
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,080
to talk to you about it
so you could hear it from me.

201
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:39,806
- Do you hear that galloping?
- Hmm?

202
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,963
Wha--oh, my--
look at that!

203
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,078
Joe Biden on a horse shirtless.

204
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:48,363
That's amazing!

205
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:50,315
Uh, I've got
a ton of work to do.

206
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,234
I'm super busy, so you...

207
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:55,286
can let yourself...

208
00:07:55,304 --> 00:07:58,190
Look, if Ann wants to leave
Pawnee, I get it.

209
00:07:58,224 --> 00:07:59,574
I mean, who wants to stay

210
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,460
in the greatest town
in the world

211
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,178
with her best friend
and be happy forever

212
00:08:03,212 --> 00:08:06,164
when she can abandon
her soul sister like an old shoe

213
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,583
and move to a garbage city
full of jerks.

214
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:11,853
I get it.
No hard feelings.

215
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:14,039
- You have to text me.
- I will.

216
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:15,323
Sorry for the delay, ladies,

217
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,209
I was busy being
ambushed by treachery.

218
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:19,144
So did you have a chance
to compare notes

219
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:20,562
on your respective duties?

220
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:21,697
Totally.

221
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:23,565
Tynny and I have been, like,
totally bonding.

222
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,717
We've just been like blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah!

223
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:27,119
Like, talking, like,
so much forever.

224
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:29,571
- It was all so delicious.
- I know, right?

225
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:30,789
This is, like,
the best day ever.

226
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:32,641
I know, I'm eating it all up.

227
00:08:32,675 --> 00:08:34,192
Wow. It's nice to see
a friendship blossoming

228
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:38,230
instead of wiling away
like a dying turd flower.

229
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:40,298
Totes.
Um, we also came up

230
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:41,983
with these nicknames
for each other.

231
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:45,187
Slut and Skank.

232
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:46,855
How craze-mazing
is that, Lez?

233
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:49,408
Well, you know what I think
is craze-mazing? Commitment.

234
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:52,144
I'm looking for someone who's
in it for the long haul.

235
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:54,563
We are basically creating
a new version of Pawnee,

236
00:08:54,597 --> 00:08:56,581
and if Pawnee is gonna commit
to one of you,

237
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:57,982
you need to commit to Pawnee.

238
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,967
Tynnyfer, do you have kids?

239
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:00,102
Ew, no.

240
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:01,486
I've had so much rejuvenation

241
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:02,988
that I don't think a baby
could get out of there

242
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:04,289
if it tried.

243
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:05,924
You know it.

244
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,260
I guess we can make
a switch to Bermuda grass.

245
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:10,195
It's only 80 cents more
per square foot?

246
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:12,664
What? Gimme gimme gimme.

247
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:15,567
You want me to put Bermuda
grass in a continental climate

248
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,402
that's a six on beaufort scale?

249
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:19,004
In a park with zero drainage?

250
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:21,473
I want Kentucky bluegrass,
I want a 10 percent discount,

251
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:23,759
and I want you to apologize
to my best friend Donna!

252
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,146
Yeah, hi.

253
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:29,914
Is there--
and I'm just guessing here--

254
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:32,250
some kind of medication
that you maybe

255
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:34,152
need a lot of
and have taken none of

256
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:35,403
or maybe too much of today?

257
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:37,422
Oh, I have a medical
condition all right.

258
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:39,357
It's called caring too much!

259
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:41,726
And it's incurable!

260
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:45,413
Also I have eczema.

261
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:49,317
Okay, Eagleton Ron, tell me
a little about yourself.

262
00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:51,920
Well, I love the outdoors,
love nature.

263
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:53,455
Amen.

264
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:55,423
I'm a big believer
in environmental conservation.

265
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:57,926
Recycling and composting
and the like.

266
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,480
I'm a yoga nut.
And I'm a nut nut.

267
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:04,232
They make delicious milks, man.

268
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:05,901
And I'm a vegan, of course.

269
00:10:05,935 --> 00:10:08,336
Slowly working toward
full freegan-vegan.

270
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:10,772
What in God's name is
freegan-vegan?

271
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:12,274
You only eat vegetables

272
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,775
that have been thrown out
in people's dumpsters.

273
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:16,528
What is on your foot, sir?

274
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:18,430
My trusty sandals.

275
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:21,399
I believe a man's feet
should remain uncaged.

276
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:23,335
Same goes for all chickens.

277
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:25,303
Well, Eagleton Ron,

278
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:29,090
we here in Pawnee value
loyalty above all else.

279
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,293
So would you be opposed
to signing

280
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:33,895
an official loyalty pledge
to our new town?

281
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,681
As long as that new town
were open to the ideals

282
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:39,284
of communal living,
everyone pitches in

283
00:10:39,318 --> 00:10:40,919
towards a common good.

284
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:42,771
In the immortal words
of Cat Stevens,

285
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:46,291
"If you want to be free,
be free."

286
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:49,261
I no longer like Ron.

287
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,812
E.R.I.C. is
an amazing program.

288
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:52,998
Fast, fun and easy to use.

289
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:55,634
But there's one thing
no man or machine

290
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,502
can beat Tom Haverford at--

291
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,188
talking mad trash
till I get what I want.

292
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:02,624
This guy Eric is a disaster.

293
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:04,626
- What do you mean?
- Just a bad attitude.

294
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,177
"Oh, I hate this place.
Get me out here."

295
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,647
That kind of thing.
And unreliable.

296
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:10,332
And racist.

297
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:11,583
I think he may have even
been to jail.

298
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:13,051
Although, you know,

299
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:14,636
maybe those are just
regular face tattoos.

300
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:17,239
Wow. That's not good.

301
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:18,340
I should probably talk to him.

302
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:20,091
Well, let me see if can
turn him around.

303
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:21,259
I don't want to put this
on your plate.

304
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:22,460
You have a lot to deal with.

305
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:25,196
Thanks, Tom.
You're the best.

306
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:28,783
Okay, let's take a look
at this list of assets

307
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,352
owned by
the Eagleton government.

308
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:32,954
400 Segway scooters.

309
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:34,238
Sell 'em.
They're gone.

310
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:36,458
You had six full-time baristas
on the payroll.

311
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:38,143
The baristas are gone.

312
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:40,445
As are the masseurs.

313
00:11:40,479 --> 00:11:42,297
And the full-time barista

314
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:44,666
who provided coffee
for the masseurs.

315
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:45,984
It is excellent

316
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:47,652
having the old band
back together again.

317
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:49,120
You know what?

318
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:52,257
This calls for some
celebratory lunges.

319
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,009
One...

320
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,293
two...

321
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:56,528
All right, Donna.

322
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:57,913
There's gonna have to be
some cutbacks.

323
00:11:57,947 --> 00:11:59,364
I mean, your job
is secure, of course.

324
00:11:59,382 --> 00:12:01,199
You're basically the glue
of this department.

325
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:03,518
But I think Craig's
gonna have to go.

326
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:05,236
No, you should keep him.

327
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:07,455
He's crazy intense,
but I've never met anyone

328
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,107
who cares more about this job.

329
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,209
Uh, Donna, I'm right here.

330
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:13,128
No joke.
He might care more than you.

331
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:14,746
Honestly, if I had to choose
between him and me,

332
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,715
- I'd choose him.
- Wait, what are you saying?

333
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:17,949
Are you thinking about leaving?

334
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,283
I wasn't planning on it,
but I could.

335
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:20,852
You know, I got the condo
in Seattle,

336
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:22,153
the fiance in Denver.

337
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:24,406
- Huh?
- It won't last.

338
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:26,257
Leslie, I would be happy
to go back into retirement

339
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,509
if you have to cut the staff.

340
00:12:27,543 --> 00:12:29,511
What?
Even Larry wants out?

341
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:30,802
What the hell
is happening here?

342
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:32,130
Does everybody think
that running a town

343
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:33,431
is just some game

344
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:35,734
where people can come
and go as they please?

345
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,919
Okey-dokey, Leslie.
You're mad at me.

346
00:12:37,954 --> 00:12:39,370
Don't take it out
on everybody else.

347
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:41,222
- It's not fair.
- I'll tell you what's not fair.

348
00:12:41,257 --> 00:12:43,174
I'm gonna have to watch
the Oscars with Ben

349
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,476
alone this year.

350
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,361
Last year, don't you remember

351
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:48,363
Angelina Jolie
and the leg dress moment?

352
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:51,967
He had, and I quote,
"no comment."

353
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:53,018
How can you not have
an extreme reaction

354
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:54,185
about a dress like that?

355
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:55,353
It just doesn't make any sense!

356
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:57,322
- Okay, we need to talk.
- I'm sorry, Ann.

357
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:58,406
I can't understand you.

358
00:12:58,457 --> 00:12:59,538
You've developed some accent

359
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:01,543
from that new town
you might move to!

360
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:03,762
It seems like
no one around here

361
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:05,597
understands the meaning
of loyalty.

362
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:07,799
I am the merger czar.
I make the rules.

363
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:09,317
And I'm gonna teach people
the meaning of loyalty

364
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:10,819
in a language
they will understand--

365
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,121
complicated legalese.

366
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:15,373
Knope,
what are these contracts?

367
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:17,375
It's just a little something
that I drew up

368
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:18,927
for all the employees
of the new town.

369
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:20,628
Basic boilerplate language,

370
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,120
50-year commitment,
blah, blah, blah.

371
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:24,082
I'm so sorry, honey,
but Tynny and I

372
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,801
won't sign anything until we
speak with our life coach.

373
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:27,886
When Eric saw this,

374
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,688
he smashed a bunch
of computers.

375
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:32,057
- Why are you doing this?
- What's the big deal?

376
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:33,608
I'm just trying to stop time

377
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:35,527
with legally-binding
friendship contracts.

378
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,228
What part of that
do you not understand?

379
00:13:37,262 --> 00:13:40,031
You have lost your mind.

380
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:42,143
I think you need
a spa day, Les.

381
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:44,069
Fine! You only have to work
here until I'm dead!

382
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:45,476
Is that better?

383
00:13:48,635 --> 00:13:51,939
What in the name of all
that is holy is that smell?

384
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,329
Yerba matte tea.

385
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:56,116
Sweetened with stevia.

386
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,318
It's an all-natural
plant extract.

387
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:00,237
Shut your damn mouth.

388
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:01,208
No need to curse.

389
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:02,670
There most certainly is.

390
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:05,824
Okay, all Eagleton people
meet me in the conference room.

391
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,960
All Pawnee people,
sit at your desks.

392
00:14:08,994 --> 00:14:10,311
And take it personally.

393
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:13,531
I kind of feel like we
got off on the wrong foot,

394
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:16,417
so I made unity cookies

395
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:17,852
with the Pawnee town's
original colors

396
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:19,070
of blue and yellow.

397
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:20,605
However, I did not have
yellow frosting,

398
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,006
so I had to use mustard.

399
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:22,974
But do not worry.

400
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:24,275
I put tons of sugar on them,

401
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:25,360
so it will even it out.

402
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:29,180
Mmm!
Sugar mustard.

403
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:31,432
That's awful kind
of you, Leslie,

404
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:33,117
but I'm afraid those are
a little too sweet for me.

405
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:35,086
I unhooked from
that big sugar train

406
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:36,888
over 30 years ago.

407
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:39,624
You are a man of principle
and I respect that, cool Ron.

408
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:41,576
So, what's your story, new Ann?

409
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,644
You're kind of pretty.

410
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:43,595
I mean, you're not
"Ann" pretty,

411
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:44,596
but you have potential.

412
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:45,730
Thank you,

413
00:14:45,781 --> 00:14:46,965
but I-I don't work
in this department.

414
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,115
Shut your kind of pretty mouth

415
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,584
and, uh, eat a mustard cookie.

416
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:52,120
Okay, so let's
chit-chat, huh?

417
00:14:52,154 --> 00:14:53,654
Let's get to know each other

418
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:54,806
and then become
familiar best friends.

419
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,090
I don't have time for this.

420
00:14:56,124 --> 00:14:57,659
I'm halfway through
designing a bamboo gazebo

421
00:14:57,693 --> 00:14:59,611
as a tribute to
the founders of motown.

422
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:00,995
That's so Craig.

423
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:03,181
Oh, Craig!
We have fun, don't we?

424
00:15:03,232 --> 00:15:05,016
Do you guys remember
when this all started

425
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:06,317
and I came in here
with the cookies,

426
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:08,102
and then Craig said
something so Craig

427
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:10,588
and we all laughed,
and we were like, "Craig!"

428
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,691
Do you think it would
be weird if we held hands?

429
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:14,959
- Probably.
- This way, please.

430
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:17,428
Excuse me, Ron, I am
talking to my best friends.

431
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:20,949
Let me go!
Best friends, attack Ron!

432
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:23,284
Ben, it has been an honor
watching you work today.

433
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,603
It's been like watching
Leonardo work.

434
00:15:25,638 --> 00:15:27,972
Da Vinci or DiCaprio.
You're that good.

435
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:31,692
Thanks, man.
I was in the zone today.

436
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,628
This really has been
a lot of fun.

437
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:35,363
The old juice is back!

438
00:15:35,397 --> 00:15:36,864
Hey, should we keep this going?

439
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,899
Celebratory dinner,
just like the old days?

440
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:41,002
Ben, that's a great idea.
Hey, you know what?

441
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,804
I know who I'm gonna use to
calculate tax and tip.

442
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:46,424
Me?

443
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,792
Can I just say something?

444
00:15:47,843 --> 00:15:49,944
I'm having
so much fun right now.

445
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:52,697
Oh, my God, me too.
Like, so much fun.

446
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:53,814
Can I just say
something, though?

447
00:15:53,832 --> 00:15:54,815
- Yeah.
- Okay.

448
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,517
You don't want this job.

449
00:15:56,552 --> 00:15:59,103
Seriously, this place
is the pits.

450
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:00,071
It's like, if you worked here,

451
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:01,322
you'd be like, "Ugh!"

452
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:03,074
And Leslie would be like,
"Blah, blah, blah."

453
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:04,842
And you'd be like,
"Uh..."

454
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:06,094
Okay, can I say something?

455
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:08,129
Right now, I totally
think that you're right,

456
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:10,448
and I had been thinking about
going someplace warm

457
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:12,500
while my husband is in jail.

458
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:14,085
Oh, my God!
Can I just say something?

459
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:15,219
- Yes!
- Okay.

460
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:17,572
You should totally stay
at my house in Miami.

461
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:19,123
- What?
- I'm serious.

462
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:22,209
Come by anytime.
Just let yourself in.

463
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:24,062
The gate kind of jams
sometimes,

464
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:25,396
but you can just jump it.

465
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:27,365
You are so amazing right now.

466
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:31,135
You're like skinny
Mother Theresa.

467
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:32,320
It's Dwayne Wade's house.

468
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:34,889
I got his address
off the Internet.

469
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:36,658
I really hope he's there
when she walks in

470
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:39,510
and he throws a basketball
at her head.

471
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:41,312
Okay, enough is enough.

472
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:42,523
What is wrong with you, woman?

473
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:43,881
I don't need to explain
myself to you!

474
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,250
I am the czar.
I can do as I please.

475
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:50,355
Those who cross the czar
feel the wrath of the czar!

476
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,459
Ann is thinking about
leaving Pawnee.

477
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:56,761
Moving, with Chris.

478
00:16:56,812 --> 00:16:58,329
Well, that's nice.

479
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:00,281
Nice, Ron? Edible
arrangements are nice.

480
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:02,800
This is
volcanically hot betrayal!

481
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:04,018
She is my best friend!

482
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:05,813
She's thinking about leaving,
just like that!

483
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:07,622
And she wants to
"talk to me" about it?

484
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:09,707
It's like, I don't even
know what to say.

485
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:12,877
That you love her and you
understand that it's her life,

486
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:15,446
and geography will never
change your feelings.

487
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:16,748
Whatever.
I don't even need her.

488
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,566
I've got Tynnyfer now,
and Craig,

489
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:21,269
and Eric, the racist drug dealer
who I've yet to meet.

490
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:22,720
Those are my real friends.

491
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:24,856
You can't force friendship,
Leslie.

492
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:26,457
It takes time.

493
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,926
I once thought I had a friend.

494
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,212
Then it turned out he was
the single worst person

495
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,713
I have ever met.

496
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:35,867
I agree with Ron, Leslie.

497
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,169
It's like Moz once said.

498
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:41,522
"Hold on to your friends."

499
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:44,158
Morrissey.
The Smiths.

500
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:45,610
You don't know <i>Meat Is Murder?</i>

501
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:46,794
It's one of the best songs
ever written

502
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:49,029
about industrialized
beef consumption.

503
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:50,765
Okay, Eagleton Ron.

504
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,233
I think it might be time
for you to go.

505
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:55,103
This Ron has the position
pretty much locked up,

506
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:58,156
and, uh, I don't think
we have any room for you

507
00:17:58,207 --> 00:17:59,157
in our department.

508
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,324
Fair enough.

509
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:02,410
I should have seen it.

510
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:06,748
Taurus and Capricorns
never mix, do they?

511
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:08,466
Just remember, Ron.

512
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,503
Giving in to hate is like
drinking saltwater.

513
00:18:12,554 --> 00:18:15,640
The thirst only grows worse.

514
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:17,175
Leslie, remove this man

515
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,761
before I commit an act of
violence against him.

516
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:23,564
Whatever you do,
I won't fight back.

517
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:28,793
After I defeated him
in an epic struggle,

518
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:29,896
E.R.I.C. is gone.

519
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:32,744
He's been replaced
by T.O.M.--

520
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:34,886
Town-wide
Organizational Matrix.

521
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:38,106
Big plans tonight, Craig?

522
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,707
No, I have a ton of work to do.

523
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,995
Plus, my DVR
is 13 months pregnant

524
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:43,382
with episodes of <i>Scandal.</i>

525
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,015
Scandal's my favorite show.

526
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,685
I love every character,
except for...

527
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,002
Mellie.

528
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,888
Oh!
Of course you like <i>Scandal!</i>

529
00:18:50,939 --> 00:18:53,594
Because you're amazing!
I love you.

530
00:18:53,714 --> 00:18:55,609
And no matter what happens
with this job,

531
00:18:55,643 --> 00:18:57,861
I will always love you.

532
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:58,862
Excuse me!

533
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:01,582
Who even are you?

534
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:03,183
How's your salad?

535
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:04,535
Well, it's called
the "Good Earth Salad,"

536
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:06,686
but really, it's just cheese,

537
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:10,157
toffee, and gummy bear worms.

538
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,742
This town is really unhealthy.

539
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:13,961
You know, I forgot
that this part

540
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:15,412
of being accounting bros

541
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:16,830
was actually pretty depressing.

542
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:20,117
I mean, after the intense,
almost meth-like high

543
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:21,585
of solving accounting puzzles,

544
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:24,922
we were always just beat
at the end of the day.

545
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:26,173
I actually think
it's something else.

546
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,642
Back in the day,
this was all we had.

547
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:30,978
We'd go into a town,
we'd fix problems.

548
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:33,680
We'd go back
to some rundown motel.

549
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,815
Yeah, you'd exercise.

550
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,266
I'd re-watch <i>Twin Peaks,</i>

551
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:37,884
then hit the <i>Twin Peaks</i>
<i>message boards</i>

552
00:19:37,902 --> 00:19:39,937
and read <i>The Secret Diary</i>
<i>of Laura Palmer</i>

553
00:19:39,988 --> 00:19:41,721
to find Easter Eggs I'd missed.

554
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,057
But now, Ann and Leslie
are our real partners.

555
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:46,193
Yeah.
It's a good thing.

556
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:49,896
But you were a fine surrogate
before we found them.

557
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:53,733
Just so you know,
we're thinking of moving.

558
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:55,068
Don't know where yet.

559
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:57,070
Maybe Michigan,
to be with Ann's family.

560
00:19:57,088 --> 00:20:00,591
Wow.
That makes me kind of sad.

561
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:05,579
But also incredibly happy
for you and Ann.

562
00:20:05,597 --> 00:20:08,599
We have come a long way.

563
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:10,134
Something healthy!

564
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:11,585
A cherry tomato.

565
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:13,187
Nope.

566
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:14,772
A gumball.

567
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:16,490
Ooh!

568
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:20,144
What I really want to
say is, I'm sorry.

569
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,862
You're my best friend.

570
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:24,431
This whole thing is just
scary and confusing.

571
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:25,699
I love you.

572
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:26,934
I want to talk about this,

573
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:30,571
all of this, whatever it means.

574
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:31,939
Was that okay?

575
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:33,457
I guess it's good.

576
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:35,959
Again, I barely know
you or Ann,

577
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,961
so I don't have much
to go off of.

578
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:40,264
- Well...
- Hey, Leslie.

579
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:42,966
Hey.
Uh, you are excused, Fake Ann.

580
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:44,251
That was six hours well spent.

581
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:45,769
I thank you.

582
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:47,271
Looks like you've made
all your decisions.

583
00:20:47,305 --> 00:20:49,189
Well, almost.

584
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:50,691
What were you talking
to Evelyn about?

585
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:53,093
Nothing.
It's not important.

586
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:55,028
The only thing
that's important is you.

587
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:56,530
I'm ready to talk about this.

588
00:20:56,564 --> 00:20:58,782
I want to talk about this.

589
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:01,201
Is now a good time?

590
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:05,605
Yes.
Now is a great time.

591
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:12,939
