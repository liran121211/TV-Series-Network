1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:01,672
Wait, I forgot!

2
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:03,814
- Who the hell is pregnant?
- What?

3
00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:06,762
I found a pregnancy test at your cabin
and I checked with all the girls over there

4
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:09,226
and wasn't any of them.

5
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:11,591
Hello, darling, what a surprise.

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:15,219
Hey. Can we talk?
Maybe in private.

7
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:21,212
You and me?

8
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:23,475
I believe
she's referring to me, son.

9
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,290
- Please excuse us.
- [Clears throat]

10
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:30,477
So I...am pregnant.

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,263
- [Chuckles]
- I see.

12
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:35,649
I don't understand how.
We were so careful.

13
00:00:35,683 --> 00:00:37,034
I warned you about this.

14
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:38,819
Standard birth control methods

15
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:41,288
aren't usually effective
against a Swanson.

16
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:43,573
I got about a million thoughts
running around in my head,

17
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:47,461
but I really just want to know
what you're thinking.

18
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:51,131
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

19
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:52,950
I was gonna wait
until our anniversary,

20
00:00:52,984 --> 00:00:55,752
take you somewhere romantic,
perhaps in a canoe--

21
00:00:55,803 --> 00:00:57,804
most likely in a canoe.

22
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:00,207
I actually built a canoe
for that purpose,

23
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:03,126
but given the news, and given

24
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:07,914
my significant feelings
for you,

25
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:09,800
now seems as good a time
as any.

26
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:12,152
Ron Swanson.

27
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:16,323
Diane Lewis...

28
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:19,159
will you marry me?

29
00:01:19,193 --> 00:01:21,261
Yes.

30
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:23,330
- On one condition.
- Anything, my love.

31
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:24,731
Ask me for anything
in the world,

32
00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:25,999
and I'll give it to you,

33
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:27,901
except a destination wedding.

34
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:30,904
Just the opposite.
We've both been married before.

35
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:33,106
I don't want anything big
or elaborate.

36
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:34,891
In fact,
the smaller the better.

37
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:36,376
I assume
you can deal with that.

38
00:01:36,394 --> 00:01:37,728
Are you kidding?

39
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:38,895
As far as I'm concerned,

40
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:42,716
we could go up
to the fourth floor right now.

41
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:45,652
Well, hello there.

42
00:01:45,687 --> 00:01:47,437
Hey, Leslie.
What's with the getup?

43
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:49,528
We're coming back from
cleaning up the Pawnee River.

44
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,591
There's nothing I love more
than squeegeeing slime

45
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:52,592
off a highway underpass.

46
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:54,094
Where are you guys going?

47
00:01:54,112 --> 00:01:55,829
The fourth floor,
getting married.

48
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:57,748
Okey-dokey.
Well, catch you later.

49
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,467
What? Wha--
[Gibberish]

50
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:03,904
What--who's--
what the--

51
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:06,706
Are you dead?
You look like you're in rictus.

52
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:08,859
I just--I'm having
so many thoughts and feelings

53
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:10,810
that I'm paralyzed right now.

54
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:12,112
Would you ladies like to come?

55
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,381
- Can I be the best man?
- Why not? Let's go.

56
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:16,483
Ron is getting married,
and I love him,

57
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:18,618
and I care about him, and this
is the greatest day ever,

58
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:20,320
and I do not have time
to talk about this!

59
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:21,321
Wait!

60
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:22,756
[Elevator bell dings]

61
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,624
If you would just
slow down a little,

62
00:02:24,642 --> 00:02:26,943
then I could arrange balloons
or a flower cake

63
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:28,578
- or a bouncy castle--
- Ah!

64
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:29,913
Ethel Beavers, we would like

65
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:31,998
a marriage license,
please and thank you.

66
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:33,466
What's the date of the wedding?

67
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:35,402
- Today.
- It's a bit unusual,

68
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:37,371
- but we both--
- Don't care.

69
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:40,507
Leslie Knope, would you please
be my matron of honor?

70
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:44,611
Diane, you have no idea
what that means to me.

71
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:45,846
She gets it.
Let's go.

72
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,882
Well, this is like
a waking nightmare...

73
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,501
of happiness.
I need to get some flowers.

74
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:54,788
Why don't you hold this colorful
bouquet of highlighters?

75
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:56,890
Rice, I need to find some rice,
I need to throw some rice.

76
00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:59,592
Why is there no rice in this
municipal government building?

77
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,611
I found a justice guy.
These are the marrying people.

78
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:02,963
- This is Carl.
- Hello, Carl.

79
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:04,637
My fiancee and I
would like to get married

80
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:05,882
right now, right here.

81
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,813
Haven't I done a quickie
wedding for you before?

82
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:10,887
It's certainly possible,
but this one's going to stick.

83
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:13,123
I need your full names
for the license.

84
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:16,893
- Ronald Ulysses Swanson.
- Diane Tammy Lewis.

85
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:18,245
Tammy?

86
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:20,747
- Your middle name is--
- Just kidding, it's Elizabeth.

87
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:22,099
- Let's go, Carl.
- Hey, hey.

88
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,800
Let's pump the brakes,
Carl, okay?

89
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:26,736
Belay that order, Carl.
Shortest possible ceremony.

90
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:28,655
I'm tired of not being married
to this woman.

91
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:30,290
Do you, Ron Swanson,
take Diane to be your wife?

92
00:03:30,324 --> 00:03:32,125
Ooh, it's going to start!
Ooh, it's happening!

93
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:33,176
- I certainly do.
- Oh, my God!

94
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:34,294
- And do you, Diane, take--
- Yes!

95
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:35,579
- Yes, I do.
- She said yes!

96
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:36,896
- Okay.
- Wait!

97
00:03:36,914 --> 00:03:39,032
- By the power vested in me--
- Before you--

98
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,333
Carl, just one second.

99
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:41,918
I would just like to give
a short speech, if I may.

100
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:43,320
You have ten seconds.

101
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:45,238
[Sighs]
At first glance, it may seem

102
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:48,208
as though Ron Swanson and I
have nothing in common,

103
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:50,076
but Webster's dictionary
defines "friend--"

104
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:51,211
- Time.
- It's--ugh!

105
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:52,596
Thank you, Leslie.

106
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:53,897
I could tell
where you were going with that,

107
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:55,131
and it was gonna be beautiful.

108
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:56,666
- I now pronounce you...
- Oh!

Hooray!

[Clapping]
Yay!

112
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:01,721
Great job, everyone.

113
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:02,973
The reception will be held

114
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:04,975
in each
of our individual houses, alone.

115
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:07,461
Pretend this is rice!

116
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:10,497

That was beautiful.

to boot me from office

for weeks.

but you know what?

We're fighting back.

127
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:48,635
I've broken my defense
initiative into 40 phases.

128
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:52,956
We are currently in phase 26:
"No problem too small."

Anyone can come to me any time
with any problem,

no matter how petty or small,

131
00:04:57,261 --> 00:05:00,564
and I will fix it personally,
and let me tell you,

132
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:03,133
some of these complaints
are pretty damn petty and small.

133
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,486
Okay, Gretel,
how can I help you today?

but not killed--I love animals.

But get rid of them.
They're gross.

138
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:17,830
But make sure they're happy
but not too happy.

Well, we're on it,
because "No problem too small."

00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:25,622

back again, I see.

00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,547
seems like
a pretty intense guy.

176
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:43,133
I am impressed by how quickly
he was able to move

177
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:45,135
such a large amount
of merchandise.

178
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:46,586
- Mm.
- He must be

179
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,139
one heck of a transporter.

180
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:51,141
My client is not Jason Statham,

181
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:52,225
if that's what you're thinking.

182
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,561
Some mysterious
big shot investor

183
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:56,980
has opened up a store
directly across the street

184
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:58,974
from rent-a-swag to try
to put me out of business.

185
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:00,233
I'm not worried, though.

186
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,402
I've poured my heart and soul
into my store.

187
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:04,321
I'm sure this guy's just looking
for a place to store

188
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,523
all his NBA championship
trophies.

189
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:09,175
- It's not Lebron James.
- Damn.

190
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,411
Well, I hate to say this, gang,

191
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:14,280
but I don't think "No problem
too small" is working.

192
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:15,598
I mean, there's been
no press coverage,

193
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:17,033
no change in my poll numbers.

194
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:19,919
I agree, we need something
massive and attention-getting,

195
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:21,838
something that will
grab people by the ears,

196
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:23,456
yell at them
through a bullhorn,

197
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,258
and hit them
like a bolt of lightning.

198
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:26,760
- I got it!
- What is it?

199
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:28,828
Oh, no, I just--
I got a fly.

200
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:30,463
I have something.

201
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:34,517
Remember phase 13,
"Think outside of the box"?

202
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:35,802
Of course.
It was an amazing phase.

203
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:37,270
Easily a top five phase.

204
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:39,055
Well, I thought
outside of the box,

205
00:07:39,106 --> 00:07:41,224
and I nominated you
for this big award.

206
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:42,508
It's called

207
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:44,177
"The International Coalition
of Women in Government,"

208
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:47,280
and you won.

209
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:48,965
There's, like, five winners,

210
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,479
and you get a big trophy
or something.

211
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:52,986
Oh, my God, this is real.
I just assumed you were lying.

212
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,455
Thank you, but yeah, it's real.

213
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:58,524
Ann Richards won it once,
and Janet Napolitano, I think.

214
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:01,661
Janet Napoli-fraking-tano?
Oh, my God.

215
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:03,380
This is amazing and perfect.

216
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:05,882
This is exactly
the kind of big, splashy thing

217
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,250
that's gonna get
the voters' attention.

218
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:08,334
When is the ceremony?

219
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:11,704
- Next month...in London.
- London?

220
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:14,808
- London?
- We're going to London?

221
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:17,093
We're going to London,
you guys!

222
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,769
I can't believe we're at Hogwarts!

223
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,671
No, that's Buckingham Palace.

224
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,757
Hogwarts is fictional.
Do you know that?

225
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,160
It's important to me
that you know that.

226
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:33,713
Okay, guys, we are going to be
sightseeing today.

227
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,147
Andy and Ben are gonna go
to their meeting,

228
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,916
and then we're gonna go
back to the hotel for lunch,

229
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,336
and I will spend the day getting
to know London's history.

230
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,739
History began on July 4, 1776.

231
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,975
Everything before that
was a mistake.

232
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:50,780
Diane suggested we "tag along
to London" for a honeymoon.

233
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:53,082
I agreed,
because my love for her

234
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,351
trumps my hatred for Europe.

235
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:57,603
Then she hit
a phase of morning sickness

236
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:00,589
that knocked her for a loop
and decided to stay home,

237
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:05,144
but she insisted I go
and take pictures for her.

238
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:06,556
All of this
could have been avoided

239
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,464
if we'd followed my plan
for a honeymoon:

240
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:09,798
a steak dinner,

241
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,567
a glass of Lagavulin whiskey,

242
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:13,986
then vigorous lovemaking
for two hours,

243
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,122
and we're both asleep
by 8:30.

244
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,556
Hey, Leslie, we're gonna
head to the meeting.

245
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:18,557
Are you okay?

246
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:19,942
Yeah, I know it's weird,

247
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,294
but I kind of feel bad
about leaving Pawnee.

248
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:25,014
It's like leaving my kid at home
without a babysitter.

249
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:26,449
Leslie, you're in London.

250
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,968
You're 4,000 miles
away from home.

251
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:32,171
- Try to enjoy this, okay?
- Yeah, you're right, as usual.

252
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:33,139
Good luck.

253
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,140
[Hip-hop music]

254
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,093
Ooh, hey...

255
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:39,679
boss man,
I want to go home early.

256
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,663
Ooh, hold on, actually.

257
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:41,947
Hang on.
Yeah, no.

258
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,533
I want to quit
and never come here again.

259
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,118
[Laughs]
Okay, bye.

260
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,970
I can't believe
I used to date you!

261
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,105
Tommy Pickles!

262
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,539
You see
there's a better version

263
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:52,058
of your store
across the street?

264
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,111
And those guys are giving out
free pizza with "papperonas."

265
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:56,662
I know, man.
That's my competition.

266
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,614
They're trying to put me out
of business, and it's working.

267
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:01,083
Three weeks ago,
this place was hopping.

268
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:02,735
My clothes were flying
off the rack.

269
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,538
I was spreading swag around town
like a killer swag virus.

270
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:08,424
Now, look at this place.
It's dead!

271
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,442
What am I gonna do?

272
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:11,060
It's like I always say, okay?

273
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,495
When life gives you lemons,

274
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,096
you sell
some of your grandma's jewelry,

275
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,164
and you go clubbing.

276
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,866
That's not
a good piece of advice.

277
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,368
So I'ma throw up.
I ate too much cheese.

278
00:10:19,403 --> 00:10:20,602
I'll talk to you!

279
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,355
[Sighs]
I need some better friends.

280
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,442
So the only thing you did
was stop drinking beer?

281
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,711
Yeah, I lost 50 pounds
in one month.

282
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:30,296
How much beer
were you drinking?

283
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,880
[Laughs]
I know, right?

284
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,566
Probably too much.

285
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,267
Andy and I are meeting with
an English charity foundation

286
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,254
to expand
our after-school music program,

287
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:40,106
and British people love me.

288
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,124
There was this British kid
in my high school

289
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:43,709
who always called me "Big Ben"

290
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,695
and would punch me really hard
on the arm,

291
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,599
and go, "Bong! Bong! Bo--"

292
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,518
Oh, he might have hated me.

293
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,203
Real quick,
should I do a British accent?

294
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,939
- Um, I'm gonna say no.
- You sure?

295
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,257
- Yeah.
- I can do one.

296
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,276
It's not very good,
but I think I could pull it off.

297
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,977
I just feel like
he's gonna get upset

298
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,879
when he finds out
that we're American.

299
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,481
He knows we're American.

300
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:07,366
Ugh, great.
All right, well,

301
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,218
I guess we'll take
the meeting anyway.

302
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,586
[Bad British accent]
After all,

303
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,121
we did come all the way
down under.

304
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,922
No.

305
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,826
Lord Covington, I'm Ben Wyatt.

306
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,514
This is Andy Dwyer, and it is
an honor to meet you, sir.

307
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:22,715
Well,
it's nice to meet you too.

308
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,334
However, the proper mode
of address would be

309
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:28,104
"Your Royal Excellency,
Lord Edgar Darby Covington,

310
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:30,372
"14th Earl
of Cornwall-upon-Tthames,

311
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:33,809
29th Baron
of Hertfordshire."

312
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:35,394
No, no, no, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

313
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,645
- Oh!
- Please, call me Eddie.

314
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,581
Oh, thank God.
[Laughter]

315
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,449
I knew that other name
must have been a stupid joke.

316
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,783
- [Laughs]
- Andy--

317
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,102
No, no, no, no,
he's absolutely right,

318
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,704
it's an absurd name.

319
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:49,592
Well, I'm excited to hear
about your musical charity idea.

320
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,894
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

321
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,446
The <i>Notting Hill</i> bus tour
starts at 2:00,

322
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:56,832
the <i>Love Actually</i> bus tour
starts at 2:30,

323
00:11:56,867 --> 00:12:00,269
and--oh, the <i>Bridget Jones</i>
bus tour starts at 2:30 also.

324
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:03,289
What do we do?
Ron, your pick.

325
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:08,310
Look, a clock.
We don't have that in America.

326
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:11,163
You call that a tower?

327
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,265
Try the Sears Tower, friend.

328
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,301
"London at night."

329
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:17,386
[Laughs]
That is very funny.

330
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,387
Can I help you, sir?

331
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,307
Yes.
I will take this.

332
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,292
We don't accept
American currency, sir.

333
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,643
Of course you do.

334
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:26,228
That's the most wonderful piece
of paper in the world.

335
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:27,229
Accept it.

336
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,531
Very sorry, sir.

337
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:30,049
Fine.

338
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,318
Enjoy the fact
that your royal overlords

339
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,487
are a frail, old woman
and a tiny baby.

[Sighs]

341
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,356
You really think
this will work, Donna?

342
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,343
Why wouldn't it?

343
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,578
We just pull
the business license--

344
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:43,746
it's public information--

345
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,497
and then at least
you'll have an address.

346
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:47,633
Ooh, here.

347
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,186
Hmm, some kind of shady,
fake shell corporation

348
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,322
- called "Open 4 Business, LLC."
- Thanks, Donna.

349
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,641
Hey, if it's Akon
and y'all become best friends,

350
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,393
I want a ride on his plane.

351
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:00,262
- Done and done.
- Nice.

00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:08,287
Ann and Chris?
What are they doing here?

354
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,958
Sir, you can't go in there!

355
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,277
Aha!
I caught you!

356
00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:18,314
- Hey, it's Tom!
- What the hell are you doing?

357
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:20,216
What am I doing?
What are you doing here?

358
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,418
Dr. Saperstein
is giving me a sonogram,

359
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:26,488
in his doctor's office,
for women, because I'm pregnant!

360
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:28,874
Oh, my God.

361
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:30,976
- You're Jean-Ralphio's dad!
- Mm-hmm.

362
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,878
You're the one that's trying
to put me out of business!

363
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,196
Well, look at that,
Mr. Haverford.

364
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,331
You tracked me down.

365
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:37,466
Looks like your detective skills
are a lot better

366
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,802
than your tween,
high-end fashion rental skills.

367
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,421
Ann, Chris,
can we have the room, please?

368
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,006
No, you certainly cannot.

369
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,974
Dr. Saperstein,
why are you doing this?

370
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:46,141
What did I ever do to you?

371
00:13:46,176 --> 00:13:48,060
You know exactly
why I'm doing this.

372
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:49,828
You destroyed my family.

373
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,880
First, you screwed my son
out of your business,

374
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,300
and then you stole
my daughter's virginity.

375
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:58,820
[Laughter]

376
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:08,080
Wait, you're serious?

377
00:14:08,131 --> 00:14:09,298
Deadly serious.

378
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:11,466
According to my daughter,
you broke her heart.

379
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,385
Then you smashed up her BMW.

380
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,603
I had to buy her a new one,

381
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,305
so she could drive
to Divinity School.

382
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:17,673
Let me tell you something,
mister.

383
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:20,726
You attack a Saperstein,
you face my wrath.

384
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,112
Be so sure about this,
Tiny Tom,

385
00:14:23,146 --> 00:14:26,298
that I will crush you
like the bug you are...

386
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,599
[Heart beating]
[Gasps]

387
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:30,569
And there it is, the heartbeat.

388
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,504
- Ohh.
- Everything sounds perfect.

389
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:33,622
Ohh.

390
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,891
This is the moment
we were dreaming of:

391
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:39,078
you and me and our baby.

392
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,581
And Tom and his weird feud
with our doctor.

393
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,316
So this after-school
music program

394
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,301
has been really successful
in Pawnee,

395
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,154
and we've expanded it
to eight other towns in Indiana,

396
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:51,340
but we feel with your help,
we can--

397
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:53,676
Whoa! Are those--
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

398
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,927
Are those
remote control helicopters?

399
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,445
- Yeah.
- What?

400
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,197
I got them as a gift.

401
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:00,316
I bought them
for one of my nephews,

402
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,616
- and then I decided to keep them.
- Yeah.

403
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,617
Would you like to play
with them?

404
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,419
Oh, would I?
I call blue one!

405
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,938
I call the--
oh.

406
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,356
Okay, you get the blue one.

Andy, we are guests
of Lord Covington.

408
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,427
Maybe you should let him...

409
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:12,845
play with the blue helicopter.

410
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:14,263
What are you talking about,
dude?

411
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:16,198
- I called it.
- He called it.

412
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,700
- That's the rule.
- That's the rule.

413
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,201
Anyway,
the orange one's better.

414
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,169
- What?
- Come on.

Hey, get off!

00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:27,676
Okay, watch out!
Watch out!

419
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:28,677
- Agh!
- Ohh!

420
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:30,813
Dude, awesome.
I think I broke mine!

421
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,015
- Oh, bummer.
- So, like, you...

422
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:34,900
your family
owns all this stuff?

423
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:36,452
Well, no, not everything.

424
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:39,221
We own that building,

425
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:42,307
that one, that house,
that round thing,

426
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,942
that one.

427
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:45,527
We don't own that.

428
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,662
Oh, no, actually,
we do own that.

429
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,415
What else does your family own?

430
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,134
Well, um, have you heard
of Scotland?

431
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,402
As I was saying,

432
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:55,537
we've really made
this music program work

433
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:57,339
in Indiana, and we think,

434
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,175
with your help,
we could turn this

435
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,843
into a wide-reaching
international program.

436
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,112
Oh, you know what I want?

437
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:04,780
Ice cream. Do you guys
have that here, ice cream?

438

Oh, it's so good.
You have to get it.

It's, like, scoops,
and it comes on a cone.

440
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:09,585
- Yeah.
- Do you have that here?

441
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:10,786
- We have it. Of course we--
- You have it?

- That'd be awesome if we were.
- Yeah.

Can we get some?
Could we...

446
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,362
do--could we have some?

447
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,363
Could we?

00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,399
Sure.

Yeah.

- Let's go.
- Just what do I do with this?

451
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,571
Just throw it there.
Roger will pick it up.

452
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:31,273

and all of the other lines,

just walk up to the mic

Welcome
to <i>The Final Word With Perd.</i>

469

Ms. Pinewood,
there is a thing you are doing,

470
00:17:07,377 --> 00:17:09,778
and that thing is
you are leading a recall vote

471
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:12,581
against Councilwoman Knope,
and you say you have

472
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,666
new, shocking allegations
about her.

473
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,452
What? What now?

00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:18,170
Perd, I take no pleasure
in reporting this,

475
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,755
but it must come to light.

We are here,
trying to make Pawnee better,

477
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,460
and where is Leslie Knope?

478
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:28,497
She's gallivanting around Europe
like some kind of European.

479

that picture so...

- But isn't it a--
- Facebook.

00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,189
Apparently, she can't be
bothered to stay here in Pawnee,

484
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,142
not when there's Europe
to gallivant around in.

485
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:41,143
Well, we conducted

486
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:43,512
a Perd poll
and asked this question:

487
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:51,820
48% said she should
not be in Europe,

488
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:53,639
17% say it's okay,

489
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,973
and 35% said

490
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,859
they were confused by the way
the question was posed.

491

Well, not to Indiana,

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,124
but there's a 9:00 red-eye
to Lisbon,

496

and then I can catch
the 4:30 A.M.

back to Edinburgh,
connect through Houston,

and then rent a car,

drive around 90,

500
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:15,326
and I'll be home
two hours earlier

501
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:18,438
than if I flew home as planned.
Easy breezy!

Leslie, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

but I do not think you should
leave Europe right now.

that I had screwed you

- out of my business...
- What?

So he was gonna screw me back.

00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,267
Any idea why he'd believe
such a thing?

517
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:49,068
That is so weird.

Honestly, now that I'm thinking
about it, this may be it.

520
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:56,609
I actually told him
that Rent-A-Swag was my idea

521

and that you had
stole it from me.

522

Why would you say that?

523
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,848
Because my dad
is always riding me

00:19:01,882 --> 00:19:03,266
for never having a job,

525
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,851

that I blew it again.

if this is relevant...

00:19:09,156 --> 00:19:10,507
that you made me sign up

529
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:12,692

and then max them out

not relevant, though.

00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,730
That's my boss!

693
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:12,232
That speech was a little rough,
don't you think?

694
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:14,313
Whatever, it's how I feel.

695
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:16,221
Stupid, ungrateful town.

696
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:17,872
Plus, you said it yourself:

697
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:19,290
We're 4,000 miles away.

698
00:25:19,324 --> 00:25:22,427
[Cell phone chiming]

699
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:24,779
- Hello.
- Leslie, it's Jerry.

700
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,030
Jerry who?

701
00:25:26,064 --> 00:25:27,198
Gergich.

702
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:28,383
Jer--oh, Jerry.

703
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:29,918
Jerry, why are you calling me?

704
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:31,803
I don't want to waste
my international minutes.

705
00:25:31,837 --> 00:25:35,356
Leslie, your speech
was webcast, here in Pawnee.

706
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:36,741
Everyone saw it.

707
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,509
What do you mean, "everyone"?

708
00:25:38,544 --> 00:25:40,678
I had organized
a big viewing party,

709
00:25:40,712 --> 00:25:41,746
you know, to support you,

710
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,314
and, well,
now that Kathryn Pinewood lady,

711
00:25:43,332 --> 00:25:44,549
she's already pounced.

712
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:47,602
She's calling it the...
"Pee-pee-head" speech.

713
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:49,487
- Bloody hell, Jerry!
- So how's Lond--

714
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:50,939
[Phone beeps]

715
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,191
I just never thought
that I would get

716
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:54,726
to make this announcement.

717
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,927
It's a very special day.

718
00:25:56,946 --> 00:25:57,996
Okay.

719
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,048
Hi, Donna.

720
00:26:00,082 --> 00:26:01,099
So...

721
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:02,100
You're pregnant.

722
00:26:02,134 --> 00:26:04,068
Oh, man, Tom told you.

723
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:05,036
Nope.

724
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,454
You're drinking decaf coffee,

725
00:26:06,505 --> 00:26:08,185
which you usually only do
in the afternoon,

726
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:09,674
you're wearing
an empire-waist dress

727
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:12,377
and loose shoes 'cause your feet
are already swelling.

728
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:14,412
I'd put you at nine,
maybe ten weeks.

729
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:15,847
My goodness, you're observant.

730
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:17,682
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.

731
00:26:17,716 --> 00:26:21,502
Hmm. When did you make
the switch to boxer briefs?

732
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:23,921
Yesterday.

733
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:26,691
Okay, please stop
looking at him.

734
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:29,060
Why are we here?

735
00:26:29,094 --> 00:26:31,212
Just thought you needed
some fresh air,

736
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:33,214
even if that air is filled
with the foul stench

737
00:26:33,265 --> 00:26:35,500
of European socialism.

738
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:37,869
You know, I know
I am supposed to feel bad

739
00:26:37,903 --> 00:26:40,805
about what I said,
but I do not.

740
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,940
Pawnee has really been
pissing me off lately.

741
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:45,410
Leslie, for God's sake,
you're the adult here.

742
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:47,378
When your kid screams
"I hate you,"

743
00:26:47,412 --> 00:26:50,181
you don't sink to his level
and yell "I hate you" back.

744
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:51,816
You have to be the grown-up.

745
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,284
[Sighs] You're right.
I know.

746
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:54,869
I have to be the grown-up.

747
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:57,855
[Whining]
But it's so hard! Ron!

748
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,324
God!

749
00:26:59,358 --> 00:27:01,275
And nobody ever thanks you.

750
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:02,827
You choose a thankless job,

751
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:04,846
you can't be upset
when nobody thanks you.

752
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:07,231
And by the way,
April thanked you.

753
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:09,233
She nominated you
for this award.

754
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:10,535
Well, April does that
all the time.

755
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:13,388
She nominated Ann for Motocross
Driver of the Year award

756
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:15,139
just so she could
get a rejection letter.

757
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:16,858
April respects you,

758
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:19,711
and so do many others.

759
00:27:19,745 --> 00:27:21,829
Don't start chasing applause
and acclaim.

760
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,315
That way lies madness.

761
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,017
[Sighs]

762
00:27:26,051 --> 00:27:27,985
Oh, I almost forgot.

763
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:30,988
I finally got you
a proper wedding gift,

764
00:27:31,006 --> 00:27:32,807
part one of many.

765
00:27:32,841 --> 00:27:34,525
A train ticket?

766
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,911
You think I want
to extend my stay

767
00:27:36,945 --> 00:27:38,579
on this godforsaken continent?

768
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:40,048
Yes, you do.

769
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:42,266
If you follow that itinerary
to the letter,

770
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:45,453
I promise you,
you will not be disappointed.

771
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:47,705
Well, I would offer
to buy you a drink,

772
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,140
but where the hell
would that even happen?

773
00:27:49,174 --> 00:27:50,992
This is London, Ron.

774
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:53,728
There's a pub over there,
there's a pub over there,

775
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:54,979
there's a pub
between those two butcher shops.

776
00:27:54,997 --> 00:27:56,381
Let's go to that one,

777
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:59,967
but we'll be stopping in
those two butcher shops first.

778
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:01,436
Hey, Jerry.

779
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,354
I didn't know
you were working today.

780
00:28:03,388 --> 00:28:05,268
Yeah, Ron asked me
to come in while he's away.

781
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,608
Of course, I had to cancel
my cardiologist appoint--

782
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:09,093
That's great.

783
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:10,762
Now, here's a piece of
information that <i>is</i> interesting.

784
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:13,448
Ann is pregnant,
and it's my baby.

785
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:15,450
Oh, my God,
that's wonderful news!

786
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:17,218
Oh, there's so much
in front of you.

787
00:28:17,252 --> 00:28:18,669
I mean,
soon you're gonna start showing,

788
00:28:18,687 --> 00:28:20,471
and then your clothes
will feel tight, and then,

789
00:28:20,505 --> 00:28:24,492
oh, people are gonna start
rubbing your tummy all the time!

790
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:26,244
[Laughs]
That sounds terrible.

791
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:28,229
Well, Gayle,
she got really queasy,

792
00:28:28,263 --> 00:28:30,098
and I gained a lot
of sympathy weight.

793
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:32,817
Yeah. You know, actually,
before my kids,

794
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:34,102
I looked a lot like you, Chris.

795
00:28:34,136 --> 00:28:36,454
I'm very sad.
Please stop talking.

796
00:28:36,488 --> 00:28:38,423
And, of course,
pretty soon, Ann,

797
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:40,308
your milk is gonna come in.

798
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:42,743
- Ohh.
- That is exciting.

799
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:43,861
Mmm.

800
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:47,381
[Gulping]

801
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:49,383
Yep, and it happens sooner
than you'd think.

802
00:28:49,435 --> 00:28:50,634
The babies can sense it.

803
00:28:50,652 --> 00:28:51,936
You would be shocked,

804
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,372
'cause they are rooting around
for that nipple.

805
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:56,090
[Smacking lips] Mm, mm.
Gimme, gimme. Mm, mm, mm.

806
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,476
I want milk!
Mm, mm, mm, mm. Ohh.

807
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,194
Life is a miracle.

808
00:29:00,229 --> 00:29:02,163
Mm, mm, mm.

809
00:29:02,197 --> 00:29:04,749
So it's kind of awesome
that the Lord Fancyface Guy

810
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:06,100
wants you to stay.

811
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:07,185
Yeah, I guess.

812
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:09,053
I mean, I can't do it,
obviously.

813
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:10,605
Why?

814
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:12,623
I don't even know
what I would be doing.

815
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:13,841
I mean, besides,
this is England.

816
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:16,627
Everything is so weird.
It's all different.

817
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:19,130
Yeah, like how they drive
on the other side of the road.

818
00:29:19,164 --> 00:29:20,181
Do they?

819
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:22,200
I'll be damned.

820
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:23,985
Yeah, like that.

821
00:29:24,036 --> 00:29:26,037
That's what I'm--
exactly what I'm talking about.

822
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:27,238
Or like the Piccadilly Circus
we went to?

823
00:29:27,256 --> 00:29:28,539
Not even a circus.

824
00:29:28,573 --> 00:29:31,142
There's no elephants,
there was no cotton candy,

825
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:33,261
there's no clowns.

826
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,512
One bearded lady.

827
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:36,230
She got all rude
when I marveled at her.

828
00:29:36,265 --> 00:29:38,783
Do you like
the Lord Fancyface Guy?

829
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:39,951
Oh, he's awesome.

830
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:41,202
He's everything
you would want in a boss.

831
00:29:41,253 --> 00:29:44,255
I mean, remote control
helicopters, talks funny.

832
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:45,540
Total package.

833
00:29:45,591 --> 00:29:47,124
I think you should do it.

834
00:29:47,142 --> 00:29:49,293
When are you gonna have
another opportunity like this?

835
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:50,294
- I mean--
- And, plus,

836
00:29:50,312 --> 00:29:51,795
we can deal
with the distance, okay?

837
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:54,682
Remember, I was
in Washington last year.

838
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:56,483
He said he wanted me
to head up the company.

839
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:58,802
I have no idea
how to run a nonprofit.

840
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,304
Hey.

841
00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:01,472
You shined shoes

842
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,859
for over two years
and never made a profit.

843
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:08,279
Come on, you can hack this.

844
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:11,148
I believe in you.

845
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:13,084
But to replace you,
I am going to have to build

846
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:15,953
a scarecrow replica of you
and take it to the movies.

847
00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:18,956
Seems like
the only logical solution.

848
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:27,489
My point is, Ethel, that

849
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,136
Ann's pregnant.

850
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:31,170
And I'm the baby daddy!

851
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,874
How wonderful for you.

852
00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:34,712
You don't seem
very excited for us.

853
00:30:34,746 --> 00:30:36,430
I barely know you,

854
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:38,102
and I don't have

855
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:41,952
to talk to you
unless it's about work.

856
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:43,828
Man, I thought
this would be more satisfying.

857
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:45,389
I agree.

858
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:47,441
Wait a minute, what time is it?

859
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:49,793
Has she landed yet?

860
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:51,948
Oh, I'm so happy for you guys!

861
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:55,170
Ohh, this is the greatest day
in the history of days.

862
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:56,372
This day,
a thousand years from now,

863
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:57,906
will be celebrated
as the beginning

864
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,908
of a new and better human race.

865
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,210
I am so happy for you,
I'm never letting you go.

866
00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:02,454
I am not gonna let you go.

00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:03,553
You're right.
I mean, I'm basically Babyface.

1041
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:05,238
You're basically Babyface!

1042
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,458
Okay, I'm gonna keep going,
and I'm gonna beat your dad.

1043
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,176
That's what I'm talking about!

1044
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:12,128
And for me, it's a win-win
either way.

1045
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,197
Either my best friend
emerges triumphant,

1046
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:17,550
or my dad beats you, and I get
all that money when he dies.

1047
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:18,518
I'm actually getting dinner
with my dad right now.

1048
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,436
- You want to come?
- No!

1049
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:22,672
[Sighs]
I mean, this is all

1050
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:24,891
pretty overwhelming, you know?

1051
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:26,776
You know what I just read?

1052
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:30,547
Right now, our baby is the size
of a green olive.

1053
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,732
- [Chuckles]
- Isn't that wild?

1054
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:33,983
It is.

1055
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,236
A green olive.

1056
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,921
A little high in sodium.

1057
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,672
I would have preferred
a chickpea or a cherry tomato.

1058
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:42,091
- Our baby's not a salad.
- Yes, right.

1059
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:44,427
It's just weird, you know?

1060
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:48,198
I mean, for so long,
this little green olive

1061
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,949
was just our thing,

1062
00:37:49,984 --> 00:37:51,885
and now it's everyone's thing.

1063
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:53,836
Every time Jerry looks at me,

1064
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,573
he's thinking about...
the milk in my boobs.

1065
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,993
It's still just our thing.

1066
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:03,012
It'll always be just our thing.

1067
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:06,282
That's why it's so wonderful
and why we'll love it so much.

1068
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,189
You know, Olive's kind of
a cute name, if it's a girl.

1069
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,657
I prefer "Chickpea."

1070
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:15,775
Because it's lower in sodium?

1071
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,094
- Yes, exactly.
- Okay.

1072
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,098
- Hey.
- Hey.

1073
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:23,533
Are you leaving?

1074
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,568
Well, I just have to get
a jump start on my next phase.

1075
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,906
Let's see, it is
"48-Hour Roadkill Scrape-athon."

1076
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:31,257
Oh, brother.

1077
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:33,676
Okay, well, before you go,
I have something for you.

1078
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,528
I feel like you're getting sad

1079
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,997
about how stupid
and lame people are,

1080
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:40,800
and that is my job, not yours.

1081
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:44,354
So I'm gonna read
this letter to you, out loud,

1082
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,738
but if you hug me afterwards,

1083
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:47,090
I swear to God, I'll scream

1084
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,342
and pull my hair out
and maybe punch you in the face.

1085
00:38:49,376 --> 00:38:51,261
- Okay?
- Okay.

1086
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,530
Please sit.

1087
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,864
[Clears throat]

1088
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:56,633
"Dear award committee
members..."

1089
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,717
[Sobbing]

1090
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,103
Leslie, I didn't even start.

1091
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,487
Okay, I'm sorry.

1092
00:39:01,522 --> 00:39:02,856
Go ahead.

1093
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,157
"Dear award committee members,

1094
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:07,243
"where I live, there are
a lot of apathetic people,

1095
00:39:07,277 --> 00:39:09,378
"people who don't care at all
about what they do

1096
00:39:09,396 --> 00:39:10,513
"or how they do it.

1097
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:12,182
"They let the world
wash over them

1098
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:14,184
"and barely notice
anyone else is even there.

1099
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:17,153
"Leslie Knope is not
one of these people.

1100
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:21,057
"She cares about everything
and everyone in our town.

1101
00:39:21,091 --> 00:39:22,392
"I don't know how she does it.

1102
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,444
"People come to her
with the pettiest,

1103
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:25,812
"stupidest problems,

1104
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,531
"and she cares--
like, really, actually cares--

1105
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,816
"what happens to them.

1106
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,468
"And if you're lucky enough
to be her friend,

1107
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:35,555
"your life
gets better every day.

1108
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,523
"She spends every waking moment
thinking

1109
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,909
"of new ways
to make her friends happy.

1110
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:42,128
"There is something wonderful
about seeing someone

1111
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,913
"who has found
her true purpose on earth.

1112
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:46,582
"For some people, I guess
that's being an astronaut

1113
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,968
"or a hot dog-eating champion.

1114
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,889
"For Leslie, her true purpose
on earth, her true meaning,

1115
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:56,425
"is making
people's lives better.

1116
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:58,528
"That's what I love about her,

1117
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,732
"and that's why she deserves
this award.

1118
00:40:02,766 --> 00:40:03,900
"Sincerely...

1119
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,735
Satan."

1120
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:07,487
You're getting hugged
right now.

1121
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:08,771
No, I told you not to.

1122
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:11,241
- I'm giving you a hug.
- No! Stay away! No!

1123
00:40:13,221 --> 00:40:15,761
All my life I've avoided Europe

1124
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:18,423
and its multitudes of terribleness.

1125
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:21,061
But it turns out,
much to my surprise,

1126
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:23,230
there is actually
one place in Europe

1127
00:40:23,264 --> 00:40:25,816
that is worth seeing:

1128
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,936
these tiny islands
off the coast of Scotland,

1129
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,605
where God's chosen elixirs
are distilled,

1130
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:33,790
barreled, and prepared
for consumption.

1131
00:40:33,825 --> 00:40:37,778
<i>This</i> is worth the trip.

1132
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:40,030
"Dear Ron,

1133
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:41,999
"you have now
reached the cliffsides

1134
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:43,750
"overlooking the islands.

1135
00:40:43,785 --> 00:40:46,920
"As you sit here
and gaze upon the waters,

1136
00:40:46,955 --> 00:40:49,122
"please read out loud the poem

1137
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:51,306
"by the great Scotsman
Robert Burns.

1138
00:40:51,426 --> 00:40:52,916
Love, Leslie."

1139
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:57,717
"Oh, were my love
yon lilac fair,

1140
00:40:57,844 --> 00:41:00,596
"with purple blossoms
to the spring,

1141
00:41:00,631 --> 00:41:03,799
"and I,
a bird to shelter there,

1142
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,686
"when wearied
on my little wing,

1143
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,689
"how I would mourn
when it was torn

"by autumn wild
and winter rude,

00:41:12,943 --> 00:41:16,062
"but I would sing
on wanton wing,

00:41:16,096 --> 00:41:19,765
when youthful may
its bloom renewed."

1148
00:41:25,872 --> 00:41:28,958
I don't know what she thought
I'd get out of that.

1149
00:41:31,295 --> 00:41:33,746
- Nice to be home.
- It is.

1150
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,415
But I mean, I love Pawnee,
I will always love Pawnee,

1151
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:37,833
but London is amazing.

1152
00:41:37,884 --> 00:41:40,670
And Silkeborg sounds amazing,

1153
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:42,421
and Mongolia sounds amazing.

1154
00:41:42,455 --> 00:41:44,840
Their mayor is a professional
Wolverine Wrangler.

1155
00:41:44,891 --> 00:41:46,625
Fine, Mongolia
sounds terrifying,

1156
00:41:46,643 --> 00:41:48,344
but the world
is a very big place,

1157
00:41:48,395 --> 00:41:50,179
and I've seen
very little of it.

1158
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:53,649
Maybe we should travel more,
expand our horizons.

1159
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:55,851
You know, I've had
the same kinds of thoughts.

1160
00:41:55,902 --> 00:41:58,804
We should keep that in mind,
see where it leads us.

1161
00:41:58,822 --> 00:42:00,139
Yeah.

1162
00:42:00,157 --> 00:42:01,440
Oh, there's one more thing
I want to try.

1163
00:42:01,474 --> 00:42:02,441
Mm.

1164
00:42:02,475 --> 00:42:03,976
I got you something in London:

1165
00:42:03,994 --> 00:42:05,695
a traditional barrister's wig.

1166
00:42:05,746 --> 00:42:08,197
- Oh.
- Wear it for me.

1167
00:42:08,248 --> 00:42:09,999
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1168
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:11,984
All right.

1169
00:42:15,172 --> 00:42:16,272
[Seductively] What's up?

1170
00:42:16,306 --> 00:42:17,957
No, not sexy.

1171
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:18,987
Failed experiment.
Take it off.

1172
00:42:19,107 --> 00:42:20,787
- Okay, just--okay.
- Just take it off. No.
