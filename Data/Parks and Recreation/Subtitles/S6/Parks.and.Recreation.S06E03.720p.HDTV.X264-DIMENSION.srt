1
00:00:01,095 --> 00:00:03,776
Okay, here's the text
I added a few more jokes,

2
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:05,612
slamming Eagleton at the end.

3
00:00:05,614 --> 00:00:06,914
Mmm.
That's the sexiest thing

4
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:08,248
you've ever said to me.

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,782
I'm so glad you're on my team.

6
00:00:09,902 --> 00:00:11,035
Are you sure you wanna
attack 'em

7
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:12,186
at this press conference?

8
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:13,236
It's a friendly wager

9
00:00:13,238 --> 00:00:15,089
on a high school
basketball game.

10
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:16,740
I'm losing
the recall election, Ben.

11
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:18,008
Slamming Eagleton
is the easiest way

12
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,276
to score some points.

13
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:21,195
Look. Am I proud of it?
Yes.

14
00:00:21,197 --> 00:00:22,496
Because Eagleton sucks.

15
00:00:22,498 --> 00:00:23,881
But is it the classiest move?

16
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:25,432
Yes, because Eagleton sucks.

17
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:26,550
Would I do it again?

18
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:28,202
Yes, because Eagleton sucks.

19
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:29,403
This year, we get to host

20
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:31,755
the Pawnee-Eagleton
tip-off classic.

21
00:00:31,757 --> 00:00:35,075
That awful human being
is Ingrid de Forest.

22
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,027
She's a city councilor
from Eagleton.

23
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:38,796
She thinks she's so great
because she won

24
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:40,731
the Miss Indiana
Beauty Pageant.

25
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,333
Last year.
While she was in office.

26
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,002
And pregnant.

27
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,453
As always,
we would like to make

28
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:48,188
a friendly wager with Eagleton.

29
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,757
If you beat us this year,

30
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,925
we will give you
a basket of apples

31
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,543
from our Pawnee orchard.

32
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:55,079
Ew, pesticide.
Yuck.

33
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:56,830
Oh, no, these
are pesticide-free.

34
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,499
I ate one of these
for breakfast this morning,

35
00:00:58,501 --> 00:00:59,883
and I found a worm in it.

36
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:03,353
So, I bet somebody feels
pretty stupid right now.

37
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:06,407
Well, Leslie, I think
we had similar ideas.

38
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,093
If you win,
Eagleton will give you

39
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:10,811
this basket of oranges.

40
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:13,230
Of course,
it's silly to compare

41
00:01:13,232 --> 00:01:15,866
apples and oranges,
but what the heck.

42
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,551
These are made
of Swarovski crystal,

43
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:19,470
and they're worth $700,000.

44
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:21,872
Leslie, you're down 15 points

45
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,791
in the latest poll
for the recall election.

46
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,676
What can you do
to make up the deficit?

47
00:01:25,678 --> 00:01:27,428
I'll tell you what I'd do
if I was an Eagletonian.

48
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,912
I'd pop a Xanax

49
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:30,664
and ask my butler
to help me out.

50
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:34,718
I mean, I'm not saying
that Eagletonians

51
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,819
are out of touch.

52
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:37,404
But when you tell 'em it's time

53
00:01:37,406 --> 00:01:38,839
to change their oil, they ask,

54
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:40,891
"Extra virgin
or white truffle?"

55
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:43,610
Thanks, guys.
I'll see ya at the game.

56
00:01:43,612 --> 00:01:45,079
Unless, of course,
you're an Eagletonian,

57
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:46,747
and then you'll be too busy
polishing your monocle

58
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:48,365
at the caviar store.

59
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,050
Knope out.

60
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:52,186
Yeah.

61
00:01:55,174 --> 00:02:03,080
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

62
00:02:12,474 --> 00:02:15,158
Who or what is <i>Penny Saver?</i>

63
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,611
It's a free circular
with a bunch of coupons in it.

64
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:19,746
This was sent to Ron Swanson

65
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:21,131
at Diane's address,

66
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,600
where I've lived
for less than a month.

67
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,269
How is that possible?

68
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,771
This is an extreme invasion
of privacy.

69
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,641
The right to privacy
is very important to me.

70
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:33,110
My family has had
a single P.O. box

71
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:34,795
for several generations.

72
00:02:34,797 --> 00:02:37,264
We only ever subscribe
to two magazines,

73
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,900
<i>Reader's Digest</i> and <i>Ebony.</i>

74
00:02:39,902 --> 00:02:41,818
<i>Ebony</i> was due
to a clerical error,

75
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,105
but it ended up being
an interesting year of reading.

76
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:46,556
I don't know how this
was delivered to me,

77
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,408
but it cannot happen again.

78
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,710
How can I stop it?

79
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:52,146
Mm. Donna is great
with this sort of thing.

80
00:02:52,148 --> 00:02:54,248
She got me off the
Williams-Sonoma mailing list,

81
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,899
but then I just
signed back up again.

82
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:57,084
Hooked on their oven mitts.

83
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:58,535
I need my mitts on those mitts.

84
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:00,187
Let me know the second
Donna returns.

85
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:01,471
According to her Twitter feed,

86
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,240
she got coffee
five minutes ago.

87
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:05,092
Wait, now she's Ustreaming
her walk back.

88
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:09,730
She should be here
in three, two, one.

89
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:11,331
Hey, hey.

90
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,434
Hashtag quest for coffee,
blowin' up my timeline.

91
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:15,903
You get my snapchat about it?

92
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,905
- No.
- What?

93
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:20,174
There it is.

94
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,926
- Hey, you wanted to see me?
- I did.

95
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:24,778
- Think fast.
- Oh, my God.

96
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,063
Hey, Dr. Buttons--

97
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:28,849
I mean, my old calculator.

98
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:30,000
It doesn't have a name.

99
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,185
Why did you throw this at me?

100
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:32,319
I just got off the phone
with our old boss

101
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:33,470
from Indianapolis,

102
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:34,721
and apparently there may be
some sort of

103
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:36,590
a budget problem in Eagleton.

104
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,092
He asked if maybe you and I

105
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,329
wouldn't have a look.
You in?

106
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:44,715
Butch Count-sidy
and the Sum-dance Kid,

107
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:46,683
together again.

108
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,672
- Hmm.
- Auditing bros!

109
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:55,425
Yeah, and auditing sistah.
Let's do this.

110
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:56,577
Oh, you're coming?

111
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,778
If there's a problem
with Eagleton,

112
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,829
I wanna be there.

113
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:00,130
That's like a dream come true.

114
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:02,466
Besides, I have a new routine
I'm working on.

115
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:04,067
Kind of like
a Jeff Foxworthy-type thing,

116
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,285
but about Eagleton.

117
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,536
If you make your omelet

118
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,922
out of Faberge eggs,

119
00:04:08,924 --> 00:04:11,725
- you just might...
- Be an Eagletonian.

120
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:13,977
Yippee! Road trip!

121
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:15,545
Who's excited to go
to Bloomington?

122
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,930
Is that where you're gonna sit?

123
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:18,982
I'm driving.
Where else would I sit?

124
00:04:18,984 --> 00:04:20,383
Trunk.

125
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,019
I helped April get
into vet school in Bloomington

126
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:23,320
and today's her orientation,

127
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:25,205
so we're taking
a little road trip.

128
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:26,640
While I'm there,
I'm also gonna pick up

129
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,124
an organic baby blanket.

130
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:30,110
I would get one in Pawnee,
but fun fact--

131
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:33,630
our only baby store is attached
to a chemical refinery.

132
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:36,717
I made a special road trip
mix CD for us.

133
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:39,720
- I hope you like Tori Amos.
- Oh, cool.

134
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,242
It really is a pleasure
to see you

135
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,510
in this context, Ingrid.

136
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:47,561
Say cheese.

137
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:49,746
Damn it.
You look beautiful.

138
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,581
Can you give us
a little more information

139
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,300
surrounding the deficits
that you're running this year?

140
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:54,635
Ooh, gosh.

141
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:57,254
We don't really like
to talk about

142
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,405
money.

143
00:04:58,407 --> 00:05:00,073
We find a little gauche.

144
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:01,742
This is a budget meeting.

145
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:03,427
Well, most of our files
are in these boxes

146
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,478
if you really wanna take a look

147
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,396
at how much that we've spent.

148
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:07,397
Why don't we just dig in

149
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,482
and see what we're up against?

150
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:09,950
Yes. And thank you.

151
00:05:09,952 --> 00:05:12,602
We really appreciate your help.

152
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,554
Are you tipping me?

153
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:17,541
Is that 100...Euros?

154
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:20,443
People ought to have
the right to be left alone.

155
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,813
I wanna get completely
off the grid.

156
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,064
That's crazy talk.

157
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,382
I live for the grid.

158
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:27,651
It's where I meet
40% of my jump-offs.

159
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:28,835
And if you're off the grid,

160
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:29,986
how are you gonna post photos

161
00:05:29,988 --> 00:05:31,421
of the dope food
at restaurants you're at

162
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:33,056
and all the cool places
you're stuntin' in?

163
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:34,141
Food is for eating.

164
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:36,693
Places are for being.
End of discussion.

165
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,245
Don't leave the grid, Ron.
The grid is the best.

166
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:40,714
If anything, you need
to get more on the grid.

167
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,550
Grid, grid, grid,
grid, grid, grid, grid--

168
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,768
If you help me
get off the grid,

169
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,720
I will let both of you
go home early.

170
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:50,957
No grid, no grid,
no grid, no grid.

171
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,125
All right, so you have

172
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:53,493
everything you need
for orientation?

173
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:55,645
Yeah, an empty Sprite can,

174
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,015
an old man's fingernail
in my pocket,

175
00:05:58,017 --> 00:06:00,434
and a picture of Patrick Ewing

176
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:01,451
on a roller coaster.

177
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:02,919
- I'm all set.
- Great.

178
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:05,155
Hi. My friend here
is enrolling

179
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,423
in the vet school next month,

180
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:08,175
and she would like
to be shown around.

181
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:10,126
Totally, happy to.
I'm Laura.

182
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:12,279
I'm April Ludgate Kevorkian.

183
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:14,031
So you go with Laura,
who seems really nice

184
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,949
and does not deserve
to be tortured.

185
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,334
And I will come
meet up with you

186
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,102
after I finish
at the baby store.

187
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:20,687
Sure you wanna
leave me here with her?

188
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:22,105
What if I'm a murderer?

189
00:06:22,107 --> 00:06:24,507
Oh, that's funny.

190
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,910
This is worse
than I could've imagined.

191
00:06:26,912 --> 00:06:29,112
Their debt-to-equity ratio
is ridonkulous.

192
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:31,131
What a hilarious word.

193
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,916
It reminds me
of a ridiculous donkey.

194
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,000
He's the best.

195
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:35,268
What does this mean for them?

196
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,686
They were in financial trouble

197
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,805
a few years ago,
like Pawnee was,

198
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:42,225
but their government
just kept borrowing money.

199
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:43,560
Eagleton is on the brink

200
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:45,695
of an epic financial disaster.

201
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,947
Ahh.

202
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,650
Now that is the sexiest thing
you've ever said to me.

203
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:51,785
Really, that?

204
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,987
This is gonna hand me
the recall election.

205
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:55,705
I saved Pawnee from bankruptcy.

206
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,908
Now I get to remind people
of that fact

207
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,493
as we watch our worst enemy

208
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:01,461
collapse into bankruptcy.

209
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,663
Plus, guess what I get
to do after the game now.

210
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:04,798
You pretend you're Ingrid.

211
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,949
Let's pretend this box

212
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:07,634
is the basket of apples
I bet them on the game.

213
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,002
I see where
you're going with this.

214
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:10,286
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, you're gonna ask me

215
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:11,755
- if I like apples--
- Do you like apples?

216
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:13,473
We just watched this movie
two nights ago, so--

217
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,641
- Do you like apples?
- I don't wanna do this.

218
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,760
How about them apples?

219
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,229
Paul, if you ever see
another one of these

220
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:21,865
with my name on it,

221
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,907
I want you to drive
into the woods and bury it.

222
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,660
I don't decide
who gets mail, sir.

223
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:26,778
I just deliver it.

224
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,213
Passing the buck--

225
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,932
the last refuge of the cowardly
and black-hearted.

226
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:33,452
- That seems harsh.
- Get out.

227
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:35,187
We got rid of your cell phone.

228
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,689
This is your last credit card.

229
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,825
Are you sure you want me
to cut up this card?

230
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,510
It gets you into
the parking garage.

231
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:42,811
I'll be taking the bus now,

232
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,646
and I'll be paying in cash.

233
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:47,299
What other traces of me
exist in the world?

234
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,633
Think, people.

235
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,385
Isn't there a photo of you
up at JJ's diner,

236
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,903
from that time when you--
aah!

237
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,238
Come on, Tom!

238
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,290
This place is unbelievable.

239
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:57,225
It has everything I need:

240
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,945
Video monitors,
lead-free pacifiers.

241
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,630
These are the first bibs
I've ever seen

242
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:04,015
without Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s
face on them.

243
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,034
Really?

244
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:07,586
April?

245
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,920
Excuse me, sorry.

246
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,189
April, why aren't you
at orientation?

247
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,407
Um, I was at orientation,

248
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,825
but it was lame, so I left.

249
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,377
And then I kept walking,
and now here I am.

250
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,079
We are going back there
right now, young lady.

251
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,081
- Mm-mm.
- Come on.

252
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,867
God, get off me, stranger.

253
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,602
I'm so sorry we're late.

254
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,070
We came from
our bankruptcy brunch.

255
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,789
And Michael Buble played,
but he ran a little long.

256
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,990
I love Michael Buble.

257
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:31,226
Was a bankruptcy brunch
the best idea?

258
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:32,277
Sure, let's not have brunch...

259
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,812
like animals.

260
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,997
Well, um, some of
these expenditures

261
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,782
are questionable.

262
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,835
Uh, you filled the public pools
with bottled water?

263
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:42,287
Total body hydration.

264
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,421
What is this here?

265
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,891
This massive expenditure
from public works?

266
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,943
Ah, yes. Well, yes.

267
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,712
We purchased HBO
for the whole town.

268
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:52,514
I'm sorry.
You spent government money

269
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:54,266
on a TV subscription?

270
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,368
It's not TV.

271
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,336
Al right.
Uh, Leslie's put together

272
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,555
a presentation
for a financial recovery.

273
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:01,589
Great.

274
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:02,741
You may find it
very informative.

275
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,743
Let's get started
with our first slide.

276
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,629
"Well, well, well..."

277
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,130
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

278
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:13,401
JJ, a few months ago,
I came in here

279
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:14,953
and began eating eggs.

280
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,855
They were delicious,
so I ordered more.

281
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,807
Before long,
I believe I had eaten--

282
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,775
51 eggs in 20 minutes.

283
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,076
Couldn't cook 'em fast enough.

284
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:23,962
The last ten were still
in the shell.

285
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,848
It was a JJ's diner record,
and you took his picture.

286
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,834
Now, we need that picture,
for privacy reasons.

287
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,119
Okay, but I don't know

288
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:33,221
how anybody
would know it's you.

289
00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:36,658
We followed your instructions.

290
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,678
That's too much information.

291
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,879
Let's go.

292
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,163
Where are we going now?

293
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,500
I've eaten a lot of food
in a lot of restaurants.

294
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:49,220
Why is everyone else
so bad at eating?

295
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,722
I only agreed to come back here

296
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:51,806
because of our deal.

297
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,041
Do you promise to play along?

298
00:09:53,043 --> 00:09:53,992
- Yes.
- Do you?

299
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,077
- Yes.
- Hi, you're back.

300
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,578
Hello again.

301
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,846
As you remember, I'm April,

302
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,683
and this is Ann,
my 65-year-old grandmother.

303
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,085
Yes, that's who I am.
Anyway,

304
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:05,353
we'd love to
hear about Bloomington.

305
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,922
It seems like a real hip
kind of college town.

306
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:11,126
Mee-maw, God, no one uses
the word hip anymore.

307
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:12,978
Sometimes I wish you
went down on the <i>Titanic</i>

308
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,679
with all your sorority sisters.

309
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,780
I would be happy
to show you guys

310
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,065
around the campus.

311
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,000
Is there anything in particular
that you wanna see?

312
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:20,868
How are your local graveyards?

313
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,905
I have some planning to do.

314
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:25,306
"You blew it.

315
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:26,574
"Super hard.

316
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:28,343
"Complete buffoonery.

317
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:29,928
It's hilarious."

318
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,045
And "You deserve it."

319
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,263
Hey, you think you might wanna

320
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,398
take it easy on them
a little bit?

321
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,283
Oh, like they
took it easy on us

322
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:36,551
when they stole all our money

323
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,886
and seceded from our town?

324
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,138
That was 200 years ago.
Cool it.

325
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,823
Fine. I'll skip ahead.

326
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:43,991
Do you have a plan
that will help us or not?

327
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:45,627
We have borrowed absolutely

328
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:46,761
everything we can
from the state.

329
00:10:46,763 --> 00:10:49,664
And really,
Pawnee is our only hope.

330
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,949
We do have a plan.

331
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:55,253
We are willing to provide
a bridge loan for $50,000.

332
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,772
25% interest
compounded monthly.

333
00:10:57,774 --> 00:10:59,491
And you need to release
a statement that says

334
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,292
that Pawnee rules
and Eagleton drools.

335
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,061
Well, now you're just
being nasty.

336
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,730
I understand that our towns
have a complicated history,

337
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,583
but we have
a saying in Eagleton...

338
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,719
"You don't kick
a dressage horse

339
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:12,504
after a failed
<i>pas de deux."</i>

340
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,738
Whatever, blondie.

341
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,874
Your butler made your bed,
now you gotta lie in it.

342
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,092
And if you walk out that door,

343
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,678
none of us here,
and I repeat, none of us

344
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,196
will ever help you again.

345
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:22,497
Oh, my God.

346
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:25,050
They have Michael Buble
on retainer.

347
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,502
Okay, all public photos
of me recovered.

348
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:30,205
Nameplate removed
from my office door.

349
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:34,726
Pediatrician files confiscated
and destroyed.

350
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,528
- Anything I'm missing?
- Great news, Ron.

351
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,096
Jean-Ralphio
loves your shirt.

352
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,881
What the hell
are you talking about?

353
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:41,182
Oh, I've been taking pictures
of you all day

354
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:42,350
for my new Facebook album:

355
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:45,737
"Ronswan: Gettin' off the grid."

356
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,322
Tom, do you maybe see a problem

357
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:52,460
with what you've done?

358
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,747
I do now.
Yes, sorry.

359
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,083
Erase.

360
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,351
Erase. Erase.

361
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,904
Erase all pictures of Ron!

362
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:05,824
Erase all pictures of Ron!

363
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:08,426
Erase all pictures of Ron!

364
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,178
What the hell is happening?

365
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,147
I think you accidentally
opened up vine.

366
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,115
You just vined
your first selfie, Ron.

367
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:16,067
And I'm vining you
vine your selfie.

368
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,337
The world is a nightmare.

369
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:22,607
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

370
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,943
Erase all pictures of Ron!

371
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,028
Erase all pictures
of Ron!

372
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,898
The B-line
is a cool outdoor trail

373
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,900
that cuts
right through downtown.

374
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:34,435
She said the B-line
is cool, Mee-maw.

375
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:35,987
Cool means good.

376
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,206
Thank you, Laura,
for showing us around.

377
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,207
Sure.

378
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:41,776
See you
in a couple weeks, April.

379
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:43,862
See?
This place is great.

380
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,580
Aren't you glad we came back
and talked to her?

381
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:47,048
No. It was pointless.

382
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,550
I'm not going to school here.

383
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:50,251
April, don't flake out on this.

384
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:52,187
You're gonna love it here.
Bloomington is great.

385
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:55,790
It's got culture and music
and tons of youngsters.

386
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:59,144
Youngsters?
Am I 65 years old?

387
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,362
Yeah, I'm not going here.
I don't want to.

388
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,781
Let's leave.

389
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:07,519
- Think fast.
- Oh!

390
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:11,105
Why do people keep assuming
I'm ready to catch things?

391
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:13,575
"Eagleton:
No money, mo' problems."

392
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:14,759
Fantastic, right?

393
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,010
I made enough of them
for everybody

394
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:17,044
to wear at the game.

395
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,596
I do like
a good internal rhyme.

396
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:19,781
Ben, you ready for dinner?

397
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:21,032
We can go over
the poll numbers.

398
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,117
Oh...you know,

399
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,786
I've got a few phone calls
to make.

400
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:26,421
Can you give me an hour?

401
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:27,972
I can meet you there.

402
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,191
Oh, my God.

403
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:32,443
- What is she doing here?
- I'm sorry, Leslie,

404
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,329
but you didn't really
help them very much,

405
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:35,580
so we volunteered to give them

406
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,248
a little financial advice.

407
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,833
You didn't actually
help us at all.

408
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:41,669
- Just one second.
- Yeah.

409
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:43,838
I'm just gonna
help them out, okay?

410
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,773
- Mm.
- Just for an hour.

411
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:47,308
He's just being
a good neighbor.

412
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,993
We're in a lot of trouble,
Leslie.

413
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,328
I don't need
any lip from you, okay?

414
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,946
You're in trouble because
of your own stupidity.

415
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:54,716
I have a PhD
from the Sorbonne.

416
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:56,835
For what?
Wearing Chanel suits?

417
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,220
There was
a fashion component, yes.

418
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:00,755
I'm not mad
that you're doing this.

419
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,456
Yes, I am mad
that you're doing this.

420
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,675
But even worse,
I'm mad that you just

421
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,009
- lied to me about it.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

422
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,294
We all swore
that we weren't gonna

423
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:07,929
ever help her again, ever.

424
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,480
I never said that.
You did.

425
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,349
I speak for all of us
in all matters.

426
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,101
That is what you
tacitly agreed to

427
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,263
- when you married me.
- What?

428
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,195
Yeah, let's go.
You've changed your mind.

429
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:17,481
You're not gonna
help her anymore.

430
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:18,482
Leslie, I just wanna

431
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:19,915
borrow your husband
for the evening.

432
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:26,185
Can we please talk about what happened
back there?

433
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:28,453
What, Ann? I just stole your phone

434
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:30,968
and texted every guy
in it that the baby was theirs.

435
00:14:31,088 --> 00:14:32,209
It's not that big of a deal.

436
00:14:32,276 --> 00:14:33,742
Listen, I know
you don't believe this,

437
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:35,878
but I care about your future.

438
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,947
And I'm just
a little disappointed

439
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:39,882
that you're just not
following through with this.

440
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:42,466
Yeah, it's not about
following through, okay?

441
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,462
I was on the fence about
whether I wanted to do it.

442
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:48,066
And as soon as I got there,
I just had a gut feeling

443
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:50,035
that it wasn't right for me,
that's all.

444
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:52,838
So, just like that,
boom--huge life decision made?

445
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,623
That's how I make
all my life decisions.

446
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,825
My gut is always right, okay?

447
00:14:56,827 --> 00:14:58,660
It was right about
marrying Andy,

448
00:14:58,662 --> 00:14:59,845
and it was right
when it told me

449
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:00,979
that you would be
the worst person

450
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:02,480
I would ever meet in my life.

451
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:04,332
And I've met Guy Fieri, Ann.

452
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,302
<i>So</i> gross!

453
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:09,104
How do you get your gut
to talk to you?

454
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:10,739
You don't get your gut
to talk to you.

455
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:13,008
You just listen
when it says something.

456
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,810
Well, right now
my gut is saying

457
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:17,696
that we are going to listen
to Mariah Carey

458
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:19,247
the whole way home.

459
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:23,602
Good.

460
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:35,213
Whoa.
Wow, I'm really surprised

461
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:37,015
you're sitting on this side
of the bleachers

462
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:39,234
and not on the Eagleton side
with your new girlfriend Ingrid.

463
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:41,570
Leslie, I'm just
trying to help them.

464
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,421
Why?
They wouldn't help us

465
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:44,422
if the tables were turned.

466
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:46,141
I mean,
they're 50 points ahead,

467
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:47,659
and they're still dunking.

468
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:49,227
I mean, look at this guy.

469
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:52,297
There's no way
he is in high school.

470
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,966
And I'm better
at French horn too, Eric.

471
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:00,405
People are gonna
lose their jobs, Leslie.

472
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,507
And the recovery
will take years.

473
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:06,027
Deep down, I think
you feel bad for them.

474
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,530
Okay, I do a little, yes.

475
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:11,516
And I'm sorry that I blew up
at you yesterday.

476
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:13,151
With all the recall stuff
happening,

477
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:15,987
I just really need to feel
like you're on my team,

478
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:18,323
and seeing you with them

479
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:20,258
made me feel like you weren't.

480
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,010
I'm always gonna be
on your team.

481
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:24,362
You never have to worry
about that.

482
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:26,631
Defense!

483
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,883
Oh!

484
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:32,370
Eagleton player number seven,
injured on the play.

485
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:33,822
Official time-out.

486
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:35,674
Oh, God.

487
00:16:35,676 --> 00:16:37,058
I'm gonna say something.

488
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,310
And if I throw up on you
after I say it,

489
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:40,912
just know that
you've been warned.

490
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:44,783
I know how we can
help Eagleton.

491
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:46,401
I don't see
what the problem is.

492
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:48,370
I will give you
a certain amount of gold

493
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:50,822
in exchange for
a recreational vehicle.

494
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:53,091
I still need an address
for insurance purposes.

495
00:16:53,093 --> 00:16:54,926
This will be my new home.

496
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:59,397
The address is wherever
it is parked.

497
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,849
Where have you been?

498
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:02,467
I had a flat tire,
and I've been trying

499
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:04,102
to get in touch with you
for hours.

500
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:05,487
Sorry, darling.

501
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:08,106
I've been busy destroying
most of my personal effects

502
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:10,458
and threatening
a postal worker.

503
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,560
Ron, I know you value
your privacy,

504
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:14,546
but you are a husband
and a father now.

505
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:16,247
You can't just
roam the streets in an RV

506
00:17:16,249 --> 00:17:18,649
and be impossible to find.

507
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:20,451
I'm on a mission
to get off the grid.

508
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,103
Well, you don't have to be
entirely on the grid,

509
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:23,921
but have to be on our grid.

510
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:27,959
I suppose you wouldn't
consider moving.

511
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:30,011
I've heard the school system
in the tunnels

512
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:32,864
beneath Yucca Mountain
is adequate.

513
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:34,616
I love you, but your solution
to every problem

514
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:36,100
is to live inside a mountain.

515
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:39,120
I love you too.

516
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:41,039
Okay, one more time.

517
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,223
Are you absolutely sure

518
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:43,558
you wanna go through with this?

519
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,210
A lot of people
are gonna get angry,

520
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:47,962
and you might lose
the recall election.

521
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:50,882
Or, if I pull it off,
I just might win.

522
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:53,084
Plus, a very smart member
of my team

523
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:55,253
pointed out
it's the right thing to do.

524
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:56,721
Good morning.

525
00:17:56,723 --> 00:17:58,189
After an all-night
strategy session,

526
00:17:58,191 --> 00:18:00,492
the towns of Pawnee
and Eagleton

527
00:18:00,494 --> 00:18:02,377
have come up
with a potential solution

528
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,796
to Eagleton's budget crisis.

529
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:06,715
The town of Eagleton
will be dissolved

530
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:09,284
and re-absorbed
into Pawnee.

531
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:12,921
Pawnee will provide
some government services,

532
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:16,524
as well as taking on
some of Eagleton's debts.

533
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:18,860
I understand.

534
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:20,829
Look, I hate Eagletonians
as much as you do.

535
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:22,480
I hate their stupid
beautiful faces

536
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:24,549
and their stupid shiny hair.

537
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:25,850
We looked at every alternative.

538
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:27,218
This is the only scenario

539
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,054
that prevents
Eagleton's financial crisis

540
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:30,955
from spiraling throughout
the entire region.

541
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:32,690
Eagleton is terrible!

542
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:34,876
Why should I bail them out
with the hard-earned money

543
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:36,194
from my unemployment check?

544
00:18:36,196 --> 00:18:38,646
- Yeah!
- Because they are our neighbor

545
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:39,981
and they've
sprained their ankle.

546
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:41,900
And when your neighbor
sprains his ankle,

547
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:43,267
you help him off the court.

548
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,703
I understand you have concerns
and questions,

549
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:47,722
and we are here
to listen to them.

550
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:49,808
I got something to say.

551
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,059
One at a time, please.

552
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:52,944
I hate
the one-at-a-time system!

553
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:54,279
Why should we bail them out?

554
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:56,081
No one bailed me out
when I got arrested for arson.

555
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,083
You can't just merge two towns.

556
00:18:58,085 --> 00:18:59,717
It's against the rules
of nature.

557
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:02,137
What's next--
merging a man with his dog?

558
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:03,388
I live in Eagleton.

559
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,256
And frankly,
I don't like the idea

560
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,591
of living in Pawnee.

561
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:09,010
They're a little--
oh, what's the word?

562
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:10,345
Have-no-money.

563
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:15,183
Bertram, that's enough.

564
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:18,019
First of all,
Eagleton has no money.

565
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:20,471
Second of all,
they are gracious enough

566
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:21,823
to throw us a lifeline,

567
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,158
and we should be
eternally grateful

568
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,976
for their generosity.

569
00:19:24,978 --> 00:19:26,644
They're a town of angels--

570
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:29,447
greasy, denim-clad angels,

571
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:31,166
but angels nonetheless.

572
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:32,984
Yeah, we'll take it.

573
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:36,838
I mean, did you steal this
from a museum?

574
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:38,578
Maybe find it frozen in ice?

575
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:40,080
It looks like
the original phone

576
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:41,548
from the movie <i>Wall Street.</i>

577
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:44,084
I think it's just
the original phone, period.

578
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:47,203
Ew, gross,
it has "buttons."

579
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:49,756
Okay, girls,
this is a magic phone, okay?

580
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:51,725
Only you and I
have got the numbers.

581
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,894
So if you ever need Ron
for any reason,

582
00:19:53,928 --> 00:19:55,728
you just call and
he'll be there in a flash.

583
00:19:55,848 --> 00:19:58,265
Yes, I will.
I'll keep it right here.

584
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:00,183
It snaps right in,
snug and secure.

585
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:01,685
A cell phone belt clip?

586
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:03,770
No, Ron.
Oh, my God!

587
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:06,389
Yeah, I can't be seen with you.

588
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:07,941
Travelin' Ann Perkins!

589
00:20:07,992 --> 00:20:09,392
How was Bloomington?

590
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,028
It was amazing.

591
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:12,612
They had all the baby
supplies we need,

592
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:14,531
and they had all this
other cool stuff.

593
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:16,566
They had
a bike-sharing program

594
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:20,037
and a vegan
Afghan restaurant and--

595
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:21,254
Oh, my God.
I'm having one.

596
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,573
- I'm having one right now.
- A contraction?

597
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:25,759
No. Dude, I'm, like,
three months pregnant.

598
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,961
I-I know.
I'm just so excited.

599
00:20:28,012 --> 00:20:31,765
The thing I'm having
is a gut feeling.

600
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,383
What would you think about
raising our child

601
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:36,236
somewhere other than Pawnee?

602
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,322
Thank you, Leslie,

603
00:20:39,357 --> 00:20:41,658
from all of us in Eagleton.

604
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:44,394
Our citizens owe you
a debt of gratitude.

605
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:45,829
Well, I think
at the end of the day,

606
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:48,025
everybody realizes
it's something we have to do.

607
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:49,399
On the bright side,

608
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:51,835
we did win the basketball game.

609
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:53,170
I think you owe us some apples.

610
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:55,205
- You better pay up.
- Oh, you don't want them.

611
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,207
All of Pawnee's apples
have been recalled--

612
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:59,342
- g. Coli.
- You mean e. Coli?

613
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:00,510
I wish.

614
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:02,451
Way easy to treat.

615
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:04,742
Welcome to Pawnee!
