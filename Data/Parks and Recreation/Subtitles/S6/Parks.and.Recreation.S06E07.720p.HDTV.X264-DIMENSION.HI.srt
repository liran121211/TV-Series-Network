3
00:00:06,247 --> 00:00:09,385
"Look, I want to quit the music/acting
business and work here with you."

4
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:11,183

"Jaden, be serious.

The world needs you.
You have a gift."

a moment of weakness,

10
00:00:21,828 --> 00:00:24,620

referred to as "sympathy"?

11
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:26,464

Come here.

331
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:36,645
My store is called <i>Rent-a-Swag.</i>
It's a clothing rental service for teens.

332
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,609
It's an interesting idea.
Are you guys doing well?

333
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,406
- We're doing amazing.
- Mm.

334
00:14:40,407 --> 00:14:42,327
And it'd be perfect
for <i>Bloosh.</i>

335

Why don't you take out whatever
you wrote about my chairs

336
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,750
and put something in
about Rent-a-Swag instead?

337
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:51,397
This month's trends are final.
I can't just throw a trend out.

338
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:56,158
But my <i>Bloosh</i> scouts have started
trend-tracking for the February zine blast.

339
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,078
- Good God, these words.
- I'll have them stop by your store.

340
00:14:59,112 --> 00:15:01,098
That'll be too late.
We'll be out of business by then.

you were doing well.

00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:06,343
Ronnie, one last time, have you
reconsidered mass production?

343
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:09,214
I can sell your chairs
on my site.

344
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:10,349
No, thank you, ma'am.

345
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:13,669
I'm not interested in letting
someone else sell my work.

346
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,017
Well, that's too bad.

347
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:20,977
This party is over.
It no longer is.

348
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:22,144
It was.

349
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:26,160
- It was...? That was my last shot.
- Sorry, Tommy.

350
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:29,218
Let's just grab some of that
lychee body oil and bounce.

351
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,470
Can you grab me some of those

353
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:35,007
Can I ask you a question?

354
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,642
Are we the cutest couple
you've ever seen?

355
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:37,943
Nope.

356
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:40,092
Okay, you want the long needle
or the short needle?

357
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:42,515
Doesn't matter. Can't find
a short needle. Long needle it is.

358
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:43,882
I have a big idea.

359
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,086
I want a portrait
of Eleanor Roosevelt,

360
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,504
tastefully done,

361
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:52,808
and then she has a very classy
tattoo of Pat Benatar on her arm.

362
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:54,560
And that's very subtle.

363
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,346
No, scratch that. Scratch all that.
Just write "Ben".

364
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:58,964
Do you have anything
to numb the pain?

365
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:01,900
Sure, take a scoop
out of the pill bucket.

366
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:04,536
Okay, you said you wanted
"mouth queen"?

367
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:07,023
No, stop. Stop it. Stop
everything that you're doing.

368
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:09,858
- Stop it.
- Ann's here! Ann wants a tattoo!

369
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,926

- No, no!

No one wants a tattoo.

372
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,116
Ann, relax.

373
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:19,301
Be "respitable"
for a second, okay?

374
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,037
What we are doing
is not nuts.

375
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:22,321
We are merely getting tattoos

376
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:25,057
so that everybody knows we love each
other and that we haven't peaked.

377
00:16:25,092 --> 00:16:28,444
- It makes a lot of sense.
- Okay, we're leaving, all right?
