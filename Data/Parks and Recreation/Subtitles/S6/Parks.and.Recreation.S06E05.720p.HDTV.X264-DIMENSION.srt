want to come to Pawnee?

177
00:06:01,065 --> 00:06:03,553
Pawnee is like
a petri dish of weird diseases.

178
00:06:03,587 --> 00:06:05,772
Did you know you have a higher
rate of the West Nile virus

179
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:07,206
than the actual Western Nile?

180
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,376
Sorry, West Nile,
looks like Pawnee wins again.

181
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:13,997
What else have you beaten
the Western Nile in?

182
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:16,199
Cricket.
Uh...

183
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:19,652
just fill out these forms,
and we will be all set

184
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:22,472
like two biscuits inside a tin.

185
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:28,294
So, you've gone insane.
That's fun.

186
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:29,262
I just panicked.

187
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:30,336
She's so out of my league,

188
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:31,281
my brain just made me
talk that way

189
00:06:31,315 --> 00:06:32,248
so I'd seem cooler.

190
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:33,249
What should I do?

191
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:34,634
Nothing!
This is amazing.

192
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:37,070
- April.
- Fine.

193
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,137
If you want to have
a chance with her,

194
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:39,973
obviously, you have to stop.

195
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:41,224
It's either that,
or you talk like that

196
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,442
for the rest of your life.

197
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:45,461
You think she'd marry me?

198
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:47,563
All right, just let me
do the talking here, okay?

199
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:49,332
I mean, he's a lawyer,
I'm an accountant.

200
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:50,783
We speak the same language.

201
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:53,987
I mean, obviously, accountants
are a little more bad boy,

202
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:56,422
but, uh,
there's a respect there.

203
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,458
- When will this be over?
- Hey, Trevor.

204
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:00,643
I've been talking to Ron
about estate planning,

205
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:05,365
and he is here to do
some "Good Will Hunting."

206
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,867
Because he has to
draw up a new will, so--

207
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:09,462
Yes, I understood,
Mr. Wyatt. Thank you.

208
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:11,471
As I've said before,
I just don't like puns.

209
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:14,140
Oh, well, my accountant
friends seem to enjoy 'em.

210
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:17,410
Mr. Swanson, let's begin
by filling out this form,

211
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:18,411
listing your assets
and liabilities.

212
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:20,013
Nice try.

213
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:22,165
I'm not telling you
how much money I have,

214
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,467
where it's hidden,
or which precious metals

215
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:27,954
and/or gemstones it may
or may not take the form of.

216
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:29,122
If you don't give me
the information I need,

217
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,156
there's nothing I can do.

218
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,391
Oh, come on, Trevor.

219
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:34,610
Where there's a "Will,"
there's a way.

220
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,879
I'm gonna say this
one last time, Wyatt.

221
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,514
Check the accountant crap
at the door.

222
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:40,316
Yes, sir, I will.

223
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:41,868
Unintentional.

224
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:43,886
All right, let's begin.

225
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:45,972
These hearings have two goals.

226
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:49,125
One, to find out exactly
how this offensive tweet

227
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:50,343
came to be sent.

228
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:52,145
And two,
to turn this whole thing

229
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,379
into a media circus.

230
00:07:53,397 --> 00:07:54,947
Ms. Knope, do you have
a statement?

231
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:56,342
Well, it's actually
quite simple.

232
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:59,886
Uh, a Parks and Rec
employee forgot to log out

233
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,360
of the Parks and Rec
Twitter account,

234
00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:05,591
they posted a personal, of the Parks 
and Rec private message by accident,

235
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:07,310
and, uh, that person
is very sorry,

236
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:08,444
and it won't happen again.

237
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:10,029
Stop stonewalling

238
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:11,414
and tell us what happened here!

239
00:08:11,465 --> 00:08:13,049
I just told you what happened.

240
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,151
It was an unfortunate mistake.

241
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:17,553
Okay, sadly,
due to your "intracksidence"--

242
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:18,588
Not a word.

243
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,139
We may never find out
what happened.

244
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:23,275
When this sick, depraved tweet
first came to light,

245
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:26,512
you said, "The account
was probably hacked

246
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,564
by some bored teenager."

247
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:31,784
Now you're saying
it's an unfortunate mistake.

248
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:33,252
Why do you keep
flip-flopping?

249
00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:35,722
Well, because I learned
new information.

250
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:37,924
When I was four,
I thought that chocolate milk

251
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,542
came from brown cows,

252
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:42,445
and then I flip-flopped
when I found out

253
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,914
that there was something
called chocolate syrup.

254
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:46,549
I don't think I'm
out of line when I say

255
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:50,403
that this scandal makes Benghazi
look like whitewater!

256
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:51,738
It's utterly meaningless.

257
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:54,340
I think we need to hear
from the unnamed employee

258
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:55,425
behind the tweet.

259
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:57,744
- Perhaps he or she--
- Or them.

260
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:00,079
It could be a bunch
of hot ladies.

261
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:01,431
Yes, perhaps "them"

262
00:09:01,465 --> 00:09:04,834
can finally give us
the answers we need.

263
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:07,720
What, what, what?
There she is.

264
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:09,305
Nadia, I didn't know
what you wanted,

265
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,190
so I got you a cappuccino,
a latte,

266
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,594
four bags of coffee beans,
and a mini espresso machine.

267
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:16,729
What happened to your accent?

268
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:20,700
Oh, yeah.
It's gone. Huh.

269
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:23,069
You know, I had a cold
recently.

270
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:25,137
I think that may have
affected my voice,

271
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:27,757
like, in certain British ways.

272
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,609
Well, that's all there is
to that story,

273
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:31,010
so no need for
any more questions.

274
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,111
You have a cold?

275
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:34,080
Can I feel your glands?

276
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:35,998
Sure.

277
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:38,676
Wow, you are wearing a lot of
moisturizer on your throat.

278
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:40,736
Best way to prevent crow's neck.

279
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,588
Is this glitter?

280
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,089
So, those are the forms.

281
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:45,441
You filled 'em out.
Great.

282
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:47,376
April's gonna file these.

283
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:50,179
Hey, when is the thing
you're doing in the park?

284
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,732
I'd love to come by and maybe
help administer vaccines?

285
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,968
Oh. Are you a doctor,
somehow?

286
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:58,571
No.

287
00:09:58,605 --> 00:10:00,907
No follow-up to that?
Okay, great.

288
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:03,426
Um, well, I'm not actually gonna
be attending the event,

289
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,977
so if you could
just give me the permit,

290
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:06,262
so that I can go home
to Indianapolis

291
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:09,882
and never come back here?

292
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:14,070
I am in love with Nadia
Whatever-her-last-name-is,

293
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:15,454
and I'm gonna keep her here,

weapon I have--

295
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:19,642
bureaucratic incompetence.

296
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:24,547
Oh, no. You filled out
Form 3208.

297
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:27,216
You were supposed to
fill out Form 3248.

298
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,901
Oh, God.

299
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:30,736
This is to lease a hangar
at the airport.

300
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:33,055
I know. It's so crazy,
it almost sounds made up.

301
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,440
Bureaucracy, right?

302
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:37,460
What are you gonna do?
Huh. Weird.

303
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:40,596
Someone left out a blender,
fresh fruits, and rum?

304
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:42,648
I guess we gotta, like,
make Daiquiris now.

Ms. Meagle,
let me first say

310
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:56,812
that I am a big fan
of your writing.

311
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:58,698
Thank you.

312
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:00,132
It's good stuff.

313
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:02,635
Really good stuff.

314
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,937
Okay, does anyone else here
see a double standard?

315
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:07,106
Councilman Dexhart
is currently being sued

316
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,158
by two different women
for sexual harassment,

317
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,111
one of whom was the judge
in the first woman's trial.

318
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:13,763
She was talking dirty to me.

319
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:14,897
She was reading the emails

320
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:16,365
that you sent
to the first woman.

321
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,950
Look, I obviously

322
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:20,636

Yeah, I don't even know
what she writes on there!

00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:27,376
Well, you may not know
what she's writing, but we do.

Why'd you do this?

331
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:42,808
Maybe if you had bothered

when I was eight.

Do you think I'm annoying?

- Are you lying?

- Are you trying to protect my feelings?

of the people
that you work with,

408
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:34,825

what you ask

because they love you.

410
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,379

people as hard as you do

411
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,448

00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:19,216
Yeah,
it's "psycho boss."

526
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,673
Eh, I don't hate that.

527
00:18:23,354 --> 00:18:25,702
Benjamin, after thinking
about what you said,

528
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:26,733
I've decided to leave

529
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:29,485
each of my children
5% of my fortune.

530
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:31,823
Wow, 5 whole percent.

531
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:34,109
So, I guess you are gonna
teach them a lesson.

532
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:37,379
Oh, my God, that's 5%?

533
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:39,031
That is a lot of money.

534
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:40,665
Wait, is this a joke?

535
00:18:40,717 --> 00:18:42,084
It is not a joke.

536
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:44,052
Not that an accountant
would know the difference.

537
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:47,222
Also, if something should
happen to Diane and me,

538
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,091
we decided
that the kids should go

539
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,176
to the most important
people in our lives.

540
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:54,980
Ron, I'm--I'm incredibly
flattered.

541
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:57,298
Ralph Piatkowski
and his wife Helen.

542
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,735
He's the Maitre D'
at Mulligan's Steakhouse,

543
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:01,820
and he knows me
better than anyone.

544
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,638
However, if they are not
able to do it,

545
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:05,991
which seems likely,
as they're in their 90s,

546
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,643
you and Leslie
are choice number two.

547
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:10,245
I'm honored.

548
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,813
Everyone, take your seats,

549
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:14,332
so this witch hunt
may proceed as scheduled.

550
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:16,418
Speaking of, uh,
where are the witches?

551
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:17,869
They're right here!

552
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,455
Well, we're not witches.
That's sexist and offensive.

553
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:21,656
But we're right here,

554
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:23,341
and we are not gonna
sit in this room

555
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:25,177
and let you drag our names
through the mud

556
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:27,179
just to score some
cheap political points.

557
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:29,097
How dare you demean the value

558
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:31,049
of the political points
I'm scoring?

559
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,467
We have had enough.

560
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:34,770
I am going back to work so I can
do some good for this town,

561
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:36,772
and my friend Donna
is coming with me.

562
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:38,557
Hmm.
I prefer "El Diablo."

563
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:40,675
Uh, this is not over,
Ms. Knope!

564
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:43,228
Donna, quit punishing me!

565
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,147
- I miss you.
- Uh-uh!

566
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:47,182
Bridge burned, Typhoon.

567
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,202
Or should I say, "Norman"?
Uh-huh.

568
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:52,353
Okay, I'm just gonna man up,

569
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:53,855
tell her how I feel,

570
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:55,073
and hope she feels
the same way about me,

571
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:56,208
and that's that.

572
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:57,325
If she doesn't,
no big deal. It's done.

573
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,460
I'm an adult.
Let's do it.

574
00:19:58,494 --> 00:20:00,212
Great.

575
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:02,247
Nope, I can't do it.
New plan.

576
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:03,381
Tell her all the screw-ups
were your fault.

577
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,800
I'll tell her I had to
cover for you,

578
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:05,801
because you are so dumb.

579
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:08,136
Nadia!

580
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:10,755
We're very sorry for everything
you went through today.

581
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:13,975
I have reserved the park
for your event.

582
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,813
Now, April has something
she'd like to admit.

583
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:19,931
Tom wants me to tell you that
all the screw-ups were my fault,

584
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:22,050
but really, he kept messing up
so that you would

585
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:23,268
stay in Pawnee
as long as possible

586
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,103
because he is super into you.

587
00:20:25,154 --> 00:20:28,056
Okay.

588
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:29,441
Several questions.

589
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:31,660
- Is any part of him British?
- No.

590
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:33,411
So, that was just weird,
panicky dude behavior?

591
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:34,496
- Yeah.
- Okay.

592
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,690
I'm just trying to figure out

593
00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:38,266
if acting that insane
is, like, romantic,

594
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:39,818
or totally scary.

595
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:42,454
I'll go with romantic.

596
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:43,889
He is kind of cute.

597
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:45,457
What's his deal?

598
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:47,375
He's sweet, he's cool,

599
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,793
and you're, like,
way out of his league,

600
00:20:48,828 --> 00:20:51,946
so there's literally
no risk for you at all here.

601
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:52,947
Okay.

602
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:54,366
Well, I am going
to Rwanda in, like,

603
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,284
two weeks for my job,
so, what the hell?

604
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:57,419
Cool.

605
00:20:57,453 --> 00:20:58,470
So, you want to go out with me?

606
00:20:58,504 --> 00:20:59,971
Yes, please.

607
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:02,974
Okay. Bye.

608
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:05,627
Okay, you owe me,
like, 1,000 favors.

609
00:21:05,645 --> 00:21:07,312
See ya.

610
