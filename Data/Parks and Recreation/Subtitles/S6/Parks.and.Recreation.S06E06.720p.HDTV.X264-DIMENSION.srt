1
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:04,830
Are you getting ready
with Andy in London?

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,087
You look lovely.

3
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:07,555
I'm going to murder you
a thousand times.

4
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:08,906
Okay.

5
00:00:08,957 --> 00:00:11,692
What the hell?

6
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:16,514
♪ Someone's back from London,
no, it's not the queen ♪

7
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:20,134
♪ someone's back from London,
it's not Mr. Bean ♪

8
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:21,652
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:24,238
♪ It's not the royal baby,
I think his name is Jeff ♪

10
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:26,057
Stop singing!
Kiss me!

11
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:28,676
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:30,111
Just missed you so bad, honey,

13
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:32,046
I bought myself a ticket home.

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,050
You're never gonna need
that computer again

15
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:38,385
'cause I'm home for,
like, 19 hours.

16
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:40,654
This is so sweet.
Just like the old days.

17
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:42,340
Take a hike, Jerry.

18
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:44,275
It's Larry now.

19
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:45,693
Okay, take a hike, Larry.

20
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:05,310
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,981
Next order of business,

22
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:10,735
Councilman Jamm
proposes Bill 949-c.

23
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:12,253
That's right, stretch,

24
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:14,622
and looking mighty fly
in that suit, brother.

25
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:15,957
Okay, this excellent bill
only allows

26
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:18,125
someone to vote
in a Pawnee election,

27
00:01:18,143 --> 00:01:21,045
for example,
the upcoming recall election,

28
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,848
if their I.D. lists
an official Pawnee address.

29
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:26,267
Really, councilman?
Again?

30
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:27,585
The recall election
is coming up,

31
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,154
and Jamm keeps trying to figure
out ways to screw me over.

32
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:32,673
Last week, he tried to have me
listed on the ballot

33
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:35,343
as "Leslie Buttface Hitler
the Fourth."

34
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:36,844
All you're trying to do
is disenfranchise

35
00:01:36,878 --> 00:01:38,562
the people
from former Eagleton,

36
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,347
people who will most likely
vote for me

37
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:41,666
because I saved
a lot of their jobs.

38
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,284
I move that we table
the discussion

39
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:44,302
until after the election.

40
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:45,286
- Second.
- Thank you!

41
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,354
- Ah!
- I'm so sorry.

42
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:49,040
I just get excited
when you like me.

43
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:52,093
I put my career on the line
by saving Eagleton,

44
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:53,828
and he's trying
to rob me of their votes?

45
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:54,912
Those are my votes.

46
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:56,580
I've earned them!
I want them!

47
00:01:56,632 --> 00:01:57,648
Give me those votes!

48
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:59,400
I don't have them on me.

49
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:01,302
I can't believe Jamm
tried to pull that crap.

50
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,620
I can.
He's a horrible monster.

51
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:04,071
But let's focus on
the more important issue.

52
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:06,307
You want to squeeze in
one more practice session?

53
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:09,143
Oh, do I?

54
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,395
Tonight, I am throwing Ben
his dream birthday party,

55
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,615
a roller skating bash
with an early '90s theme.

56
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,734
Ben lives for the early '90s.

57
00:02:16,785 --> 00:02:18,786
The music, the fashion.
It's his favorite era.

58
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,455
As for the roller skating--

59
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:23,524
I have a thing
for women in skates. Okay?

60
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:25,293
Everyone has a thing,
and that's mine.

61
00:02:25,327 --> 00:02:27,712
As far as things go,
it's pretty innocuous.

62
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:31,432
Could be one of those dudes that
kisses mannequins or whatever,

63
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:34,485
but I like a woman in skates.

64
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,554
A lot.

65
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:39,974
Hey, Ann, Ann called.

66
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:42,443
She wants her ugly outfit back.

67
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,911
Why are you dressed
as a pilgrim?

68
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:46,480
Leslie said it was a "Come
As You Were in the '90s" party.

69
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:48,182
I assumed it was the 1690s.

70
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:50,951
Babe, if it was the 1690s,
we'd all be mummies.

71
00:02:50,985 --> 00:02:53,220
What do you think mummies are?

72
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,221
Skeletons?

73
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:55,573
- Oh, boy.
- Hey.

74
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:57,691
I just came straight from work,
so I couldn't dress up.

75
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,149
No problem.
You look wiggidy-wiggidy-

76
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:00,561
wiggidy-wiggidy-wonderful.

77
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:01,795
Wait a minute.
Pants on backwards.

78
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:04,999
Kris Kross, right?
Nice!

79
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,450
What happens when
you have to pee?

80
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:07,752
I actually just went.

81
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:09,420
I had to pull my pants
all the way to the ground

82
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:10,654
like a toddler.

83
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:13,607
Nadia, the super hot doctor,

84
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,109
has been hanging out with me
for the last week.

85
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:17,228
She's definitely
out of my league.

86
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:19,430
Actually, we're not even
playing the same sport.

87
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,365
It's kind of like she's in NBA

88
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,667
and I work at a muffler store
next to the stadium.

89
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:24,668
I can't believe we met
just before

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,920
you have to go
on your stupid vacation.

91
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:28,155
I'm doing doctors
without borders, man.

92
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,457
I'm going to Rwanda.

93
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:32,159
Exactly.
That's a stupid vacation.

94
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:34,812
Okay, well, why don't you
win me that huge-ass bear

95
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:36,313
as a going-away present?

96
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:37,365
No problem.
I'm a skee ball master.

97
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:39,250
No way!
Why don't you go pro?

98
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:41,052
I don't know.
I didn't want to be a cliche.

99
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:43,320
Yet another professional
Indian skee ball player?

100
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:44,304
Right.

101
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:50,043
Now that's what
I call shooting.

102
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,479
Is this a hunting game?

103
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:52,530
Yeah, it's fun.
You want to play?

104
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:53,914
Indeed, I do.

105
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:57,251
If you'd like,
I could offer you some pointers.

106
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,320
Hunting, Donna,

107
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:02,923
is about silence,
balance, and patience.

108
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:05,643
Get ready.

109
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:12,850
You know you're supposed
to hit the deer, right?

110
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:15,469
Ugh!

111
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:16,771
Get it together, Swanson.

112
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:18,406
Well, the game is absurd.

113
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,307
This gun is lightweight,
there's no sight,

114
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:22,143
and we are far too close
to these deer.

115
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:23,844
Would they not smell us?

116
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:25,913
I want my money back.
How do I get my quarters?

117
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:27,981
Oh, my God!
You are such a sore loser.

118
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:28,959
I am not a sore loser.

119
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,167
It's just that I prefer to win,

120
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:32,269
and when I don't,
I get furious.

121
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:34,054
Employee!

122
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,475
Whoa! Watch this.

123
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,826
Oh, that was brilliant.

124
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,794
Sorry. You probably
don't know what that means.

125
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:42,630
You know how you Americans say
"cool" when something's cool?

126
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:45,065
Over in London, we say,
"That's brilliant."

127
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,367
Speaking of London,

128
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,868
you haven't told me
anything about work.

129
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:49,526
- You still love it?
- Yeah, it's awesome.

130
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:50,971
I'm kicking ass.

131
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:53,273
I'm like Chuck Norris,
only instead of crushing

132
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:57,878
bad guys' skulls,
I'm crushing documents.

133
00:04:57,912 --> 00:04:59,213
- That's great.
- Yeah.

134
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:01,048
Now be the Chuck Norris
of making out with me.

135
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:04,184
I'll karate punch your face
with my tongue.

136
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:07,505
- Prove it.
- Hi-yah.

137
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:09,073
Get this.

138
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:11,325
I just asked the DJ
what REM albums he has.

139
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:15,296
He's got <i>Monster,</i> but not
<i>Automatic For the People.</i>

140
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,314
- Wow!
- I know.

141
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:18,899
It's like, what is this?
A mid-'90s party?

142
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:20,634
No.
It's an early '90s party.

143
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,486
Okay, Larry.
Tell us how this looks.

144
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:24,305
Ben wants to do
a synchronized couple skate

145
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:25,506
to <i>Losing My Religion.</i>

146
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,474
Hit it!

147
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:32,913
Leslie!
Leslie! Leslie!

148
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:34,715
I'm sorry,
but we have a problem.

149
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,467
His name is Jeremy Jamm.

150
00:05:36,518 --> 00:05:37,768
Well, as noted in Article
nine, Paragraph two--

151
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:39,236
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

152
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:41,121
Jamm, I thought
this bill was tabled?

153
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:44,041
Yes, and I called a special
session and un-tabled it.

154
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:46,310
What's up with the roller skates?

155
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:48,696
I was about to attend
a roller skating birthday party

156
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,597
for my husband,
but this is more important.

157
00:05:50,615 --> 00:05:52,583
Yeah, I don't care.
I'm a blades guy.

158
00:05:52,617 --> 00:05:53,751
Point of order!

159
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:55,419
The councilwoman
wishes to speak on this issue.

160
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,504
Will the councilwoman
yield her time

161
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:58,772
so we can vote on this sucker?

162
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:00,774
No, I will not yield.

163
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:03,627
Nor will I yield
for the rest of the evening.

164
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:04,728
A filibuster?

165
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:06,714
Are you dookin'
on my chest right now?

166
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:08,749
No! Gross!

167
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:10,384
And yes, it's a filibuster.

168
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:11,552
Okay?

169
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:12,920
I am not willing
to let you deprive me--

170
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:14,989
She's filibustering
on roller skates?

171
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:17,474
She's gonna be strapped
into those things for hours.

172
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,009
I know this
is a dire situation,

173
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,261
but I swear to God,
this is like

174
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:22,346
a crazy sex fantasy for me.

175
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,118
How goes it?

176
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,060
Pretty good,
except I suck at skee ball.

177
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,812
Well, that's too bad, 'cause
if you don't win me that bear,

178
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:37,979
you're dead to me.

179
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:39,415
Understood.

180
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:41,415
Hey, man, how many tickets
for that bear, again?

181
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:44,778
- 40,000.
- 40,000? Oh, brother.

182
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:48,715
All right, you're gonna be
my lookout for a second.

183
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,183
Hey, is he allowed to do that?

184
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:51,852
No!
Get off the ramp, dude!

185
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,121
Hey! You're supposed
to be my lookout.

186
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:55,922
I thought it'd be funnier
to watch you get busted.

187
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,191
Hey, you're a doctor.
You know snitches get stitches.

188
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:00,994
I remember
the first time I voted.

189
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:03,563
I was in my bedroom,
and I was five.

190
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:05,916
I voted for Mildred,
my stuffed pig,

191
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,085
but my cat, pancakes, won.

192
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,452
She had more funding.

193
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,339
Politics, right?
What are you gonna do?

194
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:13,740
How long have I been talking?
Three hours?

195
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:14,858
No, eight minutes.
Okay.

196
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,826
Maybe you should
yield the floor.

197
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:17,894
Milton doesn't
have a lot of time--

198
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:19,262
left on earth.

199
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,864
Hey, just kidding, bud.

200
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,716
Will someone open my crackers?

201
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,700
The session ends
at 11:00 P.M.

202
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:25,986
She has to talk the whole time.

203
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,871
She can't lean on anything
for support,

204
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:29,573
and no one else can help her.

205
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:31,391
Three strikes and she is done.

206
00:07:31,426 --> 00:07:32,943
This is literally

207
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,611
the most exciting thing
that I've ever seen.

208
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:35,579
I mean, think about it.

209
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:36,763
Where else on earth
would you rather

210
00:07:36,798 --> 00:07:38,114
spend your birthday
with Leslie?

211
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:39,966
Well, maybe the birthday party

212
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,185
she's throwing for me
right now.

213
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:45,055
Everyone in Pawnee
should have the right to vote.

214
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,056
Whoa!

215
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,058
As I dissect this important

216
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,543
and profound statement,

217
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:50,710
I'm just gonna
take these off for a second.

218
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:53,513
Bam, strike one.
No sitting.

219
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,117
Is the gong really necessary?

220
00:07:57,151 --> 00:07:59,569
Yes, it is.
I love Chinese crap.

221
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:02,105
Lucy Liu, Nintendo,
Gangnam Style,

222
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,507
sushi, et cetera, et cetera.

223
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,376
Also, more importantly,
it's in the rules. No sitting.

224
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:07,627
Okay, fine.

225
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:08,795
Well, the strike is worth it
if I can take these off.

226
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,580
Oh, man!

227
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:12,599
Oh, my God!

228
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,036
I had this exact bear
when I was a kid!

229
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,487
- Excuse me.
- Uh-huh.

230
00:08:17,505 --> 00:08:18,889
How much does this bear cost?

231
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:20,807
40,000 tickets.

232
00:08:20,842 --> 00:08:22,526
Okay, well, let's
just assume that I'm an adult

233
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,045
who doesn't have two weeks
to play arcade games.

234
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,581
What about 50 bucks?

235
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,182
Yeah.
Just don't tell my boss.

236
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,378
- What are you doing, Morris?
- Nothing, Mr. Bonderman.

237
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:34,121
- Tuck in your shirt. God!
- Sorry.

238
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:36,690
Oh! You feeling it?

239
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:42,579
Wow.
You suck at this.

240
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:45,015
Donna, please back up two paces

241
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:47,250
so I can physically
destroy this machine.

242
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:50,770
Can you chill a little, man?
It's not real hunting.

243
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:52,055
It's just a game.

244
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:53,170
That you happen to suck at.

245
00:08:53,191 --> 00:08:55,325
You know what?
That's a good point.

246
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,960
What?
That you suck at this?

247
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:00,263
That it's not real hunting.
Come with me.

248
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,868
I don't want you
to go back to London.

249
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:06,942
Just remember, every time
you look up at the moon,

250
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:09,973
I, too, will be
looking at a moon.

251
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:12,108
Not the same moon, obviously.
That's impossible.

252
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:14,794
See you on stupid Skype.

253
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:19,282
I'm proud of Andy.

254
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:22,302
This is the first time
he's really gone out on a limb.

255
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,138
I knew if he found something
that he actually liked doing,

256
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:28,158
he'd be happy, so I'm--

257
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:32,162
What the hell?
Wha--

258
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:36,065
Hey! Perkins!
What are you doing with my bear?

259
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,083
I've been playing skee ball
for, like, two hours

260
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,168
trying to win that for Nadia.

261
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,753
I just bought it for 50 bucks.

262
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:40,904
When I was a kid,

263
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:43,139
I taught myself
how to make out on this bear,

264
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:44,674
pretended it was Cockroach
from The Cosby Show.

265
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,094
Hey, what's going on here?
Why does blossom have my bear?

266
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:50,864
I bought it for myself,
but apparently,

267
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:52,465
he was trying to win it
for you, so I'm sorry.

268
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,616
I still got
some tickets, though.

269
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,719
I could get you, uh,
a ninja turtle balloon

270
00:09:55,753 --> 00:09:57,938
or <i>Cliffhanger</i> on VHS.

271
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,739
Oh, that's so sweet,

272
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,625
but you're basically
offering me garbage.

273
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:04,561
Let's just skate.

274
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:06,515
That bear was the only thing
she was gonna have

275
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:07,781
to remember me by in Rwanda.

276
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:10,333
And if I know anything
about Rwanda, and I don't,

277
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:11,685
I bet it's full of rich guys

278
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,186
who'll buy her
whatever she wants.

279
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:21,995
Hunting.
No quarters required.

280
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,280
Hang on.

281
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:25,966
Do you have a license
to hunt at night?

282
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,852
'Cause you need a license.

283
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,078
I thought you were serious.

284
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:41,264
Come on now.
You know I don't give a [bleep].

285
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,549
As Ronald Reagan would say,

286
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:47,420
"Well, mommy, I believe
voting rights are important."

287
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:49,339
Does anyone else
think it's hot in here?

288
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:50,873
These overalls
are really starchy.

289
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:53,143
Yeah, maybe that's 'cause
I turned up the heat to 90,

290
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:55,829
and, uh, oh, the knob
broke off in my hand.

291
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,998
Oops.

292
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:00,267
Well, speaking of heat,

293
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:02,769
we should discuss
America's white-hot passion

294
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,554
for voting rights
and the men and women

295
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:05,538
who help protect them,

296
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,340
like the local
city councilwoman

297
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,726
who is starving and thinking
about her husband's

298
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,261
<i>Reservoir Dog-</i> themed
birthday cake

299
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,228
and wanting to eat it
really badly.

300
00:11:12,262 --> 00:11:14,080
Oh, this is not a good sign.

301
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:16,533
Once she starts
thinking about birthday cake,

302
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,836
she's basically useless
until she eats birthday cake.

303
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:21,804
Democracy is not unlike a cake.

304
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:24,624
It's layered, delicious,
chocolate, and I want some.

305
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:25,642
Okay, she's fading.

306
00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:27,477
Ben, we need to find
a way to smuggle

307
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:30,363
some mineral oil drops
onto her tongue.

308
00:11:30,414 --> 00:11:32,332
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Excuse me.

309
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:33,816
What the hell
are you people doing here?

310
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:36,119
We represent the citizens
of former Eagleton.

311
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:37,654
We're here to support
Leslie Knope

312
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:39,412
for preserving
our voting rights.

313
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,723
Thank you!

314
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,493
You are all warriors
of democracy.

315
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:47,180
You know, it was the first mayor
of Pawnee, in 1817,

316
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:50,233
who said, "All we have
is the right to vote

317
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:52,085
and the right to kill Indians
without consequence."

318
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,554
And I believe that half
of that statement

319
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:55,772
is still true today.

320
00:11:58,409 --> 00:11:59,359
All right!

321
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,245
Second wind!

322
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,964
Andy, I know you're in there.

323
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,984
Andy, come on.

324
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,339
Oh, hey.

325
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:14,474
I was just--

326
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:17,277
just here in this dumpster
'cause I jumped in.

327
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:19,663
Get out!
We need to talk.

328
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,581
About what?

329
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:26,336
Fresh air, real weapons,
an honest kill.

330
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,540
There is no substitute
for the real thing.

331
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,611
You want to go back and play
that video game, don't you?

332
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:38,014
Yes! Damn it!

333
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,401
It is so inspiring
to see Eagletonians

334
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:43,370
putting aside their prejudices.

335
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:45,488
With support like this,
Leslie Knope

336
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:47,790
may stand a fighting chance
on recall day.

337
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,760
- Permission to hug you.
- Granted.

338
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:52,779
I should mention, though,

339
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,314
that we're not voting
to keep Leslie.

340
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:56,066
What?

341
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,400
We want someone from Eagleton

342
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:59,902
to represent our interests
on the new city council.

343
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,238
Sir, I formally revoke our hug.

344
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:04,007
Well, you can't.
It happened.

345
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,544
We stand on the side
of Rosa Parks,

346
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,747
and Gandhi, and Team Aniston.

347
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:13,016
One small vote for Pawnee

348
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,803
is one giant leap
of voting for mankind.

349
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:18,271
Hey!

350
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:20,473
Hey, you're not allowed
to receive help from the crowd.

351
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:23,226
That's strike two.

352
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,228
Hey, man, leave my gong alone.

353
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,563
The reverb is the best part.

354
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,281
If I save your right to vote,

355
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:30,617
you're gonna vote
for someone from Eagleton?

356
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,930
Eagleton! Eagleton!

357
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:36,923
Hey, Knope! Wrap it up!

358
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:37,951
I'm not gonna yield.

359
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:39,975
I just--I need some time to think.

360
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:42,878
And because I must keep talking,
I'm gonna think out loud.

361
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:46,365
Okay, if Eagletonians
vote for someone else,

362
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,130
then it would be in my
best interest to stop, right?

363
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:51,439
So they can't vote.

364
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,861
Uh, da-doy.
Yield.

365
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:55,966
Or I keep going,

366
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,216
because the right to vote
is fundamental in any democracy,

367
00:13:59,327 --> 00:14:01,127
and this is bigger than me
or anyone.

368
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,963
I don't care if I lose.

369
00:14:02,997 --> 00:14:05,148
No one prevents people
in my town from voting.

370
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:06,416
Not on my watch.

371
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,418
The filibuster is on!

372
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:10,470
Yeah!

373
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:11,771
Okay.

374
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:12,956
I can't go back to London.

375
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,076
I'm totally in over my head
on this project.

376
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,560
Every day, someone
comes up to me and says,

377
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:19,729
"I need your approval
on this, Mr. Dwyer."

378
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,331
"I need your signature,
Mr. Dwyer."

379
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,615
"That's not a toilet,
Mr. Dwyer."

380
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,985
But you said everything
was going awesome.

381
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,619
You said you
were like Chuck Norris.

382
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:28,154
I am, but I'm
like Chuck Norris now--

383
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:31,024
some old guy with a beard
who used to be good at karate

384
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:32,976
but became a dumb has-been

385
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,096
and is scared and confused
about his big London job.

386
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,313
Okay.

387
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:39,499
The parallels between
he and I are very eerie.

388
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,968
I'm gonna tell you a secret
about everyone else's job.

389
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:43,386
Okay.

390
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:45,155
No one knows
what they're doing.

391
00:14:45,206 --> 00:14:48,174
I don't know how to run
an animal control department.

392
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:50,193
Half the documents I get
I put right into the shredder

393
00:14:50,227 --> 00:14:51,528
because they're so boring.

394
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:53,613
But you seem like you
do know what you're doing.

395
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:54,881
Yeah, I seem like it.

396
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:57,350
Deep down,
everyone is just faking it

397
00:14:57,368 --> 00:15:00,470
until they figure it out.

398
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:02,405
And you will too,
because you are awesome

399
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,391
and everyone else sucks.

400
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:09,679
- 30 minutes to go.
- Oh, God, it's so hot.

401
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:11,781
Almost as hot as the flames

402
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:14,084
that Eagleton
would have gone down in

403
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:15,535
if I had not saved them.

404
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:21,591
Mm, mm, mm.

405
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,344
- That's--
- How I know you would love

406
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:27,914
an ice-cold frozen marg.

407
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:30,050
All I want
is the promise of democracy.

408
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:31,184
Sure about that?

409
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:33,236
- I want that marg.
- I know you do.

410
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:35,538
- I want that Margarita.
- Oh, it's gonna be so good.

411
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:37,323
So cold.
It's so cold.

412
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:39,943
- I want to drink it.
- Make that heat go away!

413
00:15:39,977 --> 00:15:42,579
Come on, get!

414
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:44,130
Come on, girl.
Get!

415
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:46,049
Give me that Margarita!

416
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,369
No!
I want votes.

417
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:54,707
Excuse me, worker,

418
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:56,809
bring me a bucket of beers
and four hot dogs.

419
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:57,810
Please, and thank you.

420
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,829
Why are you covered in blood?

421
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,798
Don't worry.
It's not human.

422
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:04,100
I hope you've made peace
with your God,

423
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:06,152
small electronic deer.

424
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:08,121
Kill it.

425
00:16:08,155 --> 00:16:09,939
Ann, I need that bear.

426
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:11,724
I got to give Nadia
something awesome

427
00:16:11,758 --> 00:16:13,276
so she'll remember me
when she's in Africa.

428
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,213
Tom, bear or no bear,
she clearly likes you.

429
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:19,599
Actually, how do you even
get girls like her--

430
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:21,184
or me--
to go out with you?

431
00:16:21,218 --> 00:16:22,852
Scientists say
the emotions of love and hate

432
00:16:22,903 --> 00:16:23,970
are very close to each other.

433
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:25,171
That's what I tell women.

434
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:27,423
The point is,
she's leaving in two days.

435
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,476
You want her to remember you?

436
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,477
Go spend time with her

437
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,328
and do something
memorable, dummy!

438
00:16:32,363 --> 00:16:33,797
Thanks, Ann.

439
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:35,448
I know conversations
like this are hard for you

440
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:36,966
'cause you still
have feelings for me,

441
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:38,601
but you'll land
on your feet, kid.

442
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:41,171
- Run or I punch you.
- No punchies!

443
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:45,091
Okay, bye for real this time.

444
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:49,329
Wait, wait, wait.

445
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:51,047
I made you five bologna
sandwiches

446
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:52,482
in case you get hungry
on the way to the airport.

447
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:53,599
Did you--

448
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:55,118
Yes, I used cookies
instead of bread.

449
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:57,253
You think of everything.
I love you.

450
00:16:57,288 --> 00:16:59,589
Love you too.

451
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:06,779
Are you kidding me?

452
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:09,799
- Andy!
- Ha! Ha! Found it!

453
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,351
I got--I left my wallet
in here earlier, I guess.

454
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,537
Whoo! All good now.

455
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:16,455
Ooh, look!
Noodles!

456
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:18,808
No, no, no, babe.
Babe, don't touch those.

457
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,443
I've read the entire charter.

458
00:17:20,477 --> 00:17:23,563
There's no other way
to get her a bathroom break...

459
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:27,366
unless we bring
the bathroom to her--

460
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:28,384
that's nothing.

461
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:29,936
I mean,
she's not gonna make it.

462
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,472
Look at her, she's dancing
around like she's a character

463
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:34,140
in one of those
<i>Peanuts</i> cartoons.

464
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:37,493
Okay,
in these last few minutes,

465
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:41,714
I would like to talk about
the voting rights act of 1968

466
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:44,851
while clenching every muscle
in my body.

467
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:46,019
Sound good?

468
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:48,221
Hey, Knope,
how you feeling over there?

469
00:17:48,255 --> 00:17:50,240
You go pee-pee?
Pee-pee times?

470
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,574
Make wee-wee?

471
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,575
Ten more seconds.

472
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:56,963
Four, three, two, one!

473
00:17:56,997 --> 00:17:59,865
This session is adjourned.

474
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:01,968
All pending matters are tabled.

475
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:05,638
Yes!

476
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:07,390
- You were amazing.
- I love you, but move!

477
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:08,541
I have to go
to the whiz palace.

478
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,542
Oh, wait!

479
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,177
Eagleton! Eagleton!

480
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:15,431
Oh!
My beautiful curls!

481
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:16,882
She didn't have time to hug me,

482
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:18,268
but she could do that?

483
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:23,258
Hey, Ann, can I talk to you
for a second? About Tom?

484
00:18:23,378 --> 00:18:24,212
Sure.

485
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,760
You guys look like
you're having fun.

486
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:27,056
Yeah, no, I really like him.

487
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,609
I just wanted to say that
I think you're really cool,

488
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,990
and the fact that Tom dated you

489
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,527
makes me think
he's a really good guy.

490
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:35,863
That's so sweet.

491
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:38,566
Oh, okay.

492
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,567
Wha--what are you--

493
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,018
- What the hell?
- Now!

494
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,286
Sorry, Ann, this is on you.

495
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,068
You told us to make a memory.

496
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,022
- There's your money back.
- Let go!

497
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,025
Suck it!

498
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,027
This is $8!

499
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,379
- Man, that was so much fun.
- Yeah.

500
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:54,531
Together,
we truly did steal a toy

501
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:56,133
from your pregnant friend.

502
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,586
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

503
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,972
I know we just met, like,
two weeks ago and whatever,

504
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,308
but is there any chance maybe,

505
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:05,643
when you get back,
we can maybe--

506
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,212
Ugh. Clingy.

507
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,547
Oh, no. Sorry.
No, no, no, no.

508
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:12,549
I'm kidding.

509
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,068
Of course I'll call you
when I come back.

510
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:16,437
- Really?
- Yeah.

511
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,273
So long, suckers!

512
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,908
Hey! Quick!

513
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:25,746
Ooh!

514
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

515
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,282
Now that's what I call shooting.

516
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,834
- Come on!
- That's a new record!

517
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:30,868
Hey!
Look at that!

518
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:33,170
You finally made it
in the top 10.

519
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,455
Now you can
enter your initials.

520
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,790
My initials are private.

521
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,094
Then just put in
any three letters.

522
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:46,100
Ass.

523
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,089
Oh, my God!
That was epic!

524
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,307
I was peeing so freakin' hard,

525
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,775
it was like
a jacuzzi jet or--

526
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:56,944
- Hi, Leslie.
- Hey! Ingrid!

527
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:59,363
I wasn't talking
about the velocity of my pee

528
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:01,157
because you are a very smart
and classy lady.

529
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,600
Ben, you remember
Ingrid de Forest

530
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:05,035
from the former Eagleton.

531
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,288
Yes, she was just telling me
she's been nominated

532
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:09,990
to run against you
in the recall.

533
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,276
Wow.
Buzz kill.

534
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,128
I know you must hate me
right now, Leslie,

535
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:15,880
and that's justified,

536
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:19,383
but I need to thank you
for what you just did in there.

537
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,001
Not the forceful urination.
The filibuster.

538
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:22,303
Right, yeah.

539
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:25,956
It was incredibly courageous,
and it was selfless.

540
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,291
And if I do win,

541
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,459
I'm gonna have very big
roller skates to fill.

542
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:33,013
Could I take you out
for a celebratory plate of--

543
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,315
I think you call them waffles?

544
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:36,400
Wow, that is the best offer
you could ever make,

545
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:39,753
but I had to miss my husband's
birthday party for this,

546
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:42,006
so I think I'll be spending
the evening with him.

547
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,076
- A rain check, maybe.
- Please.

548
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:49,013
I'm sorry your birthday party
got all screwed up.

549
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,714
Maybe I should put
those roller skates back on.

550
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:51,966
Well, you must be exhausted.

551
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,100
We don't have
to go to the party.

552
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:55,102
Oh, we're not
going to the party.

553
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:56,687
We're going home.

554
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:59,423
Then why would you need
to put on roller...skates?

555
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,925
Oh, yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

556
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:05,233
We're just--
we're just--skates...
