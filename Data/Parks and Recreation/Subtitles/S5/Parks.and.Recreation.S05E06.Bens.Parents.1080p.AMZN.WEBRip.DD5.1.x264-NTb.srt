1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:04,038
- IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL AND SPARKLY.
- I KNOW.

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:06,240
AND IT'S A NON-CONFLICT DIAMOND.
- AW.

3
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:08,276
- WHEN ANDY PROPOSED TO ME,
HE GAVE ME A RING POP,

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,578
BUT THEN HE ATE IT FIRST.
HOW DID BEN DO IT?

5
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,246
- LET ME START
FROM THE BEGINNING.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,082
- UH-OH.
- IN 1832,

7
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:17,718
BEN'S GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-
GRANDFATHER, TEODORE WYATT,

8
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,421
A BASTARD, MET A BEAUTIFUL
SEAMSTRESS FROM ANTWERP.

9
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:21,755
BEN AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED,
AND I'VE BEEN TELLING

10
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,324
EVERYBODY ABOUT IT.

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,725
I'M SO HAPPY, I WANT
TO SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS.

12
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,127
- AND SHE HAS.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,162
WE'VE GOTTEN
SEVERAL NOISE COMPLAINTS.

14
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:30,631
- WE'RE GETTING MARRIED!
- ALL RIGHT.

15
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:34,235
- MM, THE JOY
THAT I AM FEELING

16
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:38,206
RIGHT NOW IS PROFOUND
AND UNMATCHED IN THE MODERN ERA.

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,341
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT IT MEANS TO ME

18
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,643
THAT I'M THE VERY FIRST PERSON
THAT YOU CHOSE TO TELL.

19
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:43,777
- OH--

20
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:46,847
- LET ME WALK AROUND
WITH YOU

21
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,948
AS YOU TELL EVERYONE ELSE

22
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:53,387
SO THAT I CAN SHARE TRUE JOY
BEING SPREAD, PLEASE?

23
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,388
- HEY, EVERYONE!

24
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,624
WE HAVE SOMETHING
VERY EXCITING TO TELL YOU

25
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,359
THAT YOU HAVE
NEVER HEARD BEFORE.

26
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,627
- BEN AND I ARE ENGAGED...
- WHAT?

27
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,794
- AND YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT IT

28
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,496
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
RIGHT NOW.

29
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,631
[all cheering]

30
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:06,334
- COME ON, EVERYBODY!
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE EXCITEMENT?

31
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:07,201
LESLIE AND BEN
ARE ENGAGED!

32
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:08,035
NOTHING WILL EVER COME
BETWEEN THEM!

33
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,338
[all cheering]
LESLIE AND BEN ARE--

34
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,273
- [laughs]
WHAT'S GOING ON?

35
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:13,274
- LESLIE AND BEN ARE ENGAGED!

36
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:16,377
- [gasps]
AGAIN?

37
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,311
YOU GUYS!
- OH.

38
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:18,412
- OH.
- OH, YEAH!

39
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:20,214
- [grunts]
AAH!

40
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:23,217
[triumphant music]

41
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:31,259
*

42
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,171
- OKAY, T-MINUS SIX HOURS
UNTIL THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

43
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:45,406
HAS YOU-KNOW-WHO
RESPONDED YET?

44
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,276
- SURPRISINGLY, NO,
LARRY BIRD HAS NOT RSVP'D YET.

45
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,643
- WELL, HE KIND OF WAITS
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.

46
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:51,212
THAT'S HIS STYLE.
PUT HIM DOWN AS A "MAYBE."

47
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:52,646
ARE YOU EXCITED?
- YEAH, TOTALLY.

48
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,515
I-I JUST HAVE
TWO SMALL REQUESTS.

49
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,884
ONE, PUT TWIZZLERS
ON THE CANDY TABLE,

50
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00,188
AND TWO,
CANCEL THE PARTY

51
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,189
BECAUSE YOU INVITED
MY PARENTS,

52
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,657
AND THEY CAN'T BE
IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER.

53
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,326
OKAY?
GREAT, THANK YOU.

54
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,761
- NO TO CANCELING THE PARTY,
AND NO TO TWIZZLERS.

55
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,563
WE ARE A RED VINES FAMILY.

56
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:10,664
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET USED TO THAT.

57
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,833
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,
BUT I LOVE YOU,

58
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,835
AND THIS PARTY
IS GONNA GO GREAT.

59
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,304
- WELL, IF THERE'S ANYONE

60
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:19,173
WHO CAN BRING MY PARENTS
TOGETHER,

61
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:20,441
IT'S NO ONE.

62
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,344
NO ONE CAN EVER
BRING THEM TOGETHER.

63
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,845
MY FAMILY SITUATION
IS COMPLICATED.

64
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,615
MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED
30 YEARS AGO

65
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,484
AND THEY HATE EACH OTHER.

66
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,820
OKAY, I GUESS IT'S NOT
THAT COMPLICATED.

67
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:36,424
- OKAY! YOU GUYS PRETEND
YOU'RE RON SWANSON,

68
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:38,226
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DECIDE

69
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,660
WHETHER YOU WANT
TO INVEST IN THIS COMPANY.

70
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,362
BE SUPER CRITICAL.

71
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,496
- YOU'RE SHORT.

72
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,832
- AND HERE...WE...GO!

73
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,334
[dance music]

74
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:50,371
TOM HAVERFORD
AND JEAN-RALPHIO SAPERSTEIN...

75
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,274
- CREATORS
OF ENTERTAINMENT 720...

76
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,243
- PROUDLY PRESENT...

77
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:58,646
both: RENT A SWAG!
- WAH!

78
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,514
- PARENTS, ARE YOU TIRED
OF WATCHING

79
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:02,250
YOUR MIDDLE-SCHOOL-AGED
CHILDREN GROW OUT

80
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,285
OF THE NICE CLOTHES
YOU BUY FOR THEM?

81
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,287
THEN RENT THEM!
FROM RENT A SWAG.

82
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,488
I OWN IT.

83
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,324
YOU RENT IT.
YOU WEAR IT.

84
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,726
YOU CLEAN IT.
YOU RETURN IT.

85
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,562
I GET RICH.
WINK!

86
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:15,696
- RENT A SWAG!

87
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:16,830
* WHERE YOUR SWAG
IS MY BUSINESS! *

88
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,499
- OKAY, STOP.
YOU GUYS, STOP!

89
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,633
STOP!

90
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,701
- * AND YOUR BUSINESS
IS MY SWAG *

91
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,336
- STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP,
STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP!

92
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,238
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- PLEASE.

93
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:26,307
- THERE'S ACTUALLY
A LOT MORE,

94
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,941
BUT TELL US
YOUR THOUGHTS SO FAR.

95
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,777
- IT'S THE GREATEST THING I'VE
EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

96
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,512
- YES!
- NO! IT'S TERRIBLE.

97
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,281
- IT'S TERRIBLE,
YOU GUYS.

98
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:34,715
I LOVE YOU, BABY.
YOU'RE SO SMART.

99
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,584
- YOU'RE PRESENTING THIS
TO RON SWANSON.

100
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:39,420
DON'T TALK ABOUT ANY
OF YOUR OLD, FAILED BUSINESSES,

101
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,754
GET RID
OF THAT STUPID LIGHT SHOW,

102
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:42,890
AND DEFINITELY DON'T USE
ANY WEIRD, MADE-UP WORDS

103
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,525
THAT RON DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

104
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,327
- BUT THE PRESENTATION'S
TOMORROW AT 8:00 A.M.

105
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,828
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO START FROM SCRATCH.

106
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,732
- WELL, IF YOU DO ANY OF THAT,
HE'S NOT GONNA INVEST, SO...

107
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,268
YOUR FUNERAL.

108
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,269
- HEY!
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

109
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:56,704
LET'S GO OVER THE PLAN.

110
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,541
- OKAY, YOU AND I GO STARGAZING
IN HARVEY JAMES PARK,

111
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,411
WHILE MY PARENTS
SLOWLY STRANGLE EACH OTHER

112
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:04,512
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

113
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:07,448
- NO.
YOUR MOM ARRIVES AT 7:00.

114
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,817
WE HAND HER A GLASS
OF CHILLED WHITE WINE,

115
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,019
AND, OH, LOOK,
MY MOM IS WALKING OVER,

116
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,887
AND THEY'RE BOTH
EDUCATORS AND MOTHERS.

117
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,656
WHAT A FABULOUS COINCIDENCE.

118
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,925
THEN LATER, STEPHEN WYATT
SHOWS UP--THAT'S YOUR DAD.

119
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,527
- YES.
HE'S TERRIFYING.

120
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,994
- WE MAKE SOME SMALL TALK,

121
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,463
AND 30 MINUTES LATER,

122
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:26,033
I SHOW EVERYBODY
THE BIG SURPRISE.

123
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,635
THE KNOPE-WYATT UNITY QUILT.

124
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:28,969
BEN AND I ARE WEAVING
OUR LIVES TOGETHER,

125
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,838
SO I HAVE WOVEN THIS QUILT.

126
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:35,343
IT REPRESENTS EVERY MEMBER
OF OUR NEW UNITED FAMILY.

127
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,077
OF ALL MY METAPHORICAL
ART PROJECTS,

128
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,313
THIS IS BY FAR
THE COZIEST.

129
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:41,349
- THIS IS AMAZING.
- I KNOW.

130
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:42,616
I WORKED REALLY HARD ON IT.

131
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,051
AND, OUT OF RESPECT,

132
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,086
I DID NOT INCLUDE ANY IMAGES
OF THE ONLY OTHER MAN

133
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,456
IN THE WORLD
WHO'S AS SEXY AS YOU, JOE BIDEN.

134
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,923
- YES, YOU DID, RIGHT THERE.
- HMM?

135
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,360
OH, WELL,
THAT'S JUST A LITTLE ONE.

136
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,928
THE POINT IS, THIS QUILT IS
GOING TO UNITE THE WYATT CLAN.

137
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,799
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
AND IT WON'T.

138
00:04:58,832 --> 00:04:59,767
[chattering]
[tapping glass]

139
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,735
- EVERYONE,
BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE GETS HERE,

140
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,004
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
A LITTLE TOAST.

141
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,775
MY ROMANTIC LIFE HAS BEEN
A BIT OF A MIXED BAG LATELY.

142
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,545
AND WHEN THAT'S THE CASE,
IT'S HARD NOT TO BE CYNICAL

143
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,847
ABOUT LOVE AND RELATIONSHIPS,
BUT IT'S COUPLES LIKE YOU

144
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,349
THAT GIVE HOPE
TO THE REST OF US.

145
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:18,886
LESLIE, YOU DESERVE THE BEST,
AND YOU FOUND IT.

146
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,022
BEN, DON'T YOU DARE HURT HER.
[laughter]

147
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,357
- I WON'T.

148
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:25,526
- DON'T LAUGH.
SHE MEANS IT.

149
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,927
- OKAY, I-I WON'T.

150
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,563
- SERIOUSLY, SON,
DON'T HURT HER.

151
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:31,665
- OKAY, I'M NOT PLANNING
ON HURTING HER.

152
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,734
- YOU BETTER NOT BE.
- I'M NOT!

153
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,437
- HEY, BEN,
YOU BEST WATCH YOURSELF.

154
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,971
- WHY WOULD ANY OF YOU THINK
I WOULD HURT LESLIE?

155
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,873
YOU'RE ALL MY FRIENDS TOO.

156
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,074
- NAH.

157
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,943
- THIS WAS LITERALLY

158
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,813
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
AND MOVING THING

159
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,383
THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD.
[cries]

160
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:50,718
- THERE, THERE,
BABY BOY.

161
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:54,688
TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED.
- [cries]

162
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,425
- WELL, SURE, IN A WRESTLING
MATCH, KIRK WOULD WIN.

163
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,393
BUT OVERALL, WHO WOULD YOU
RATHER HAVE AT THE HELM

164
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:01,462
OF YOUR
SOVEREIGN-CLASS STARSHIP?

165
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,397
JEAN-LUC PICARD.
NO CONTEST.

166
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:04,432
- HEY, YOUR MOM'S HERE.
I NEED YOU.

167
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,799
- THANK GOD.

168
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,001
- THERE'S MY BOY!
- HEY, MOM.

169
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,437
NICE TO SEE YOU.

170
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,472
THIS IS LESLIE KNOPE,
MY FIANCEE.

171
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,774
- HI. IT'S--IT'S REALLY NICE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU, MS. WYATT.

172
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,443
- OH! PLEASE CALL ME JULIA.

173
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,077
IS YOUR FATHER HERE YET?

174
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,013
- NO FIGHTING TONIGHT, MOM.
- DON'T WORRY!

175
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,148
I'M GOING TO BE CIVIL,
AS LONG AS HE IS.

176
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,017
FRANKLY, AFTER WHAT HE DID
AT GEOFFREY'S GRADUATION--

177
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,086
- OH, I HAVE SOME WHITE WINE
FOR YOU, SOME CHARDONNAY.

178
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,188
- OH, THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

179
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,758
RIGHT THIS WAY.
[laughter]

180
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,160
- [laughs nervously]

181
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:36,430
- HEY, YOU GUYS, COME ON IN.
- THANK YOU.

182
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,732
- [cries]

183
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:41,602
ANN.

184
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:42,736
- HEY.

185
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,638
YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?

186
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,874
- THE TOAST THAT YOU GAVE
TO BEN AND LESLIE

187
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,008
WAS SO BEAUTIFUL,

188
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,579
AND I'M FEELING VERY RAW
FROM MY THERAPY.

189
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:56,450
I AM SO HAPPY...
AND SO SAD.

190
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:59,587
IT'S LIKE A PERFECT STORM
OF EMOTIONS.

191
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,158
AND SO I'M HIDING OUT HERE,
SO I DON'T RUIN THIS PARTY

192
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,695
FOR MY TWO AMAZING
BEST FRIENDS

193
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,130
WHO I LOVE SO MUCH.

194
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,465
OH!

195
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,701
THERE'S NO MORE TISSUE.

196
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,168
EVERYTHING ENDS! [cries]
- NO, NO, NO.

197
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,904
NO, THERE'S MORE TISSUE.

198
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,708
THERE'S--
- EVERYTHING GOES AWAY.

199
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,643
- AND I SAID,
RULES OR NO RULES,

200
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,944
I JUST HAVE TO KISS
THAT BEAUTIFUL FACE.

201
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,112
- [chuckles]

202
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,113
- WELL, THAT'S
A KNOPE WOMAN FOR YOU.

203
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,115
WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING ADORABLE,
WE ATTACK IT.

204
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:31,018
- HE IS ADORABLE,
ISN'T HE?

205
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,220
YOU CHOSE WELL, BENNY.

206
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,255
- AW, THANK YOU.

207
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,156
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

208
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,491
- I'LL ADMIT IT.

209
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,759
THINGS ARE GOING
SURPRISINGLY WELL.

210
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,127
- YEAH.

211
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,261
- AND PACK IT UP.
IT'S OVER, WE'RE SCREWED.

212
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,796
- HE BROUGHT HIS GIRLFRIEND?

213
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,264
HE WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BRING HIS GIRLFRIEND, BEN.

214
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,799
- OH, BEN!

215
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,735
YOUR FATHER BROUGHT
HIS LITTLE PLAYTHING.

216
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,169
- HIYA, BENNY.
- HEY, DAD, HI.

217
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,939
- [laughs]
- HI.

218
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,040
[smack]
UNH.

219
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,708
HI, ULANI.

220
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:56,276
THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T COMING.

221
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,713
- ULANI IS MY GIRLFRIEND,
AND SHE'S IMPORTANT TO ME,

222
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,048
AND I NEED HER HERE.

223
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,250
- ULANI, HI, I'M LESLIE.
WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

224
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,118
WE'RE SO HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

225
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,254
- WHAT THE HELL, STEVE?
THEY DIDN'T KNOW I WAS COMING?

226
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,223
- WE DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS SPRING BREAK. [chuckles]

227
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:11,659
- OKAY, THANKS, EVERYBODY,
FOR COMING.

228
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,160
I'M SO SORRY
YOU ALL HAVE TO GO HOME.

229
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,963
- HEY, RED VINES ANYONE?

230
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,999
- WE'RE A TWIZZLERS FAMILY.

231
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,202
- OKAY, WE ARE OFF
TO A ROCKY START,

232
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,638
BUT WE ARE GONNA FIX THIS.
- YES, WE WILL.

233
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,874
I CALLED A CAB.
IT'S OUTSIDE.

234
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,810
I GAVE THE DRIVER 100 BUCKS
TO SIT AND WAIT,

235
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,112
SO WHENEVER
WE'RE READY TO GO--

236
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,313
LIKE, MAYBE RIGHT NOW--

237
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,082
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS WALK OUTSIDE.

238
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,951
- NO, I WANT TO BE HERE NOW,
WITH YOU AND YOUR PARENTS.

239
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,152
HELP ME MAKE THIS WORK.

240
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,254
- OKAY, FINE.
BEST THING TO DO IS

241
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,290
DISTRACT THEM
WITH INNOCUOUS TALK

242
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,793
ABOUT THE STUFF THEY CARE ABOUT.
- GREAT, LIKE WHAT?

243
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,795
- WELL, THEY'RE WHITE PEOPLE
FROM MINNESOTA,

244
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,130
SO HOCKEY, FISHING, SKIING,
SAILING, AND AFTER A FEW DRINKS,

245
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,699
PUT ON A PRINCE ALBUM.

246
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,266
DON'T MENTION
THE GREEN BAY PACKERS

247
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,603
OR THE STATE OF IOWA.
AND ALSO,

248
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:56,870
I HAVE ENOUGH
FREQUENT FLYER MILES

249
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,639
TO GET US TO AUSTRALIA
TONIGHT.

250
00:08:58,672 --> 00:08:59,640
- EVERYTHING OKAY?
- UH, SLIGHT SPEED BUMP.

251
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,843
EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE,
BUT I AM GOING TO FIX IT

252
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,044
WITH MY SECRET WEAPON.

253
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,779
- [cries]
- OKAY, WELL I WILL MAKE SURE

254
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:06,614
THAT EVERYTHING ELSE
RUNS SMOOTHLY.

255
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:07,848
- ANN, YOU ARE SUCH
A GOOD FRIEND.

256
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,919
YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL, TALENTED,
BRILLIANT, POWERFUL MUSK OX.

257
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:14,855
THANK YOU, OX,
FOR KEEPING THIS SHIP AFLOAT.

258
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,690
- YOU GOT IT.

259
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,859
GUYS, I NEED YOUR HELP,
OKAY?

260
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,094
CHRIS IS IN THE BACK ROOM,
AND HE'S CRYING.

261
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,730
GO IN THERE, CALM HIM DOWN,
MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER.

262
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,098
LESLIE AND BEN HAVE ENOUGH
TO DEAL WITH, OKAY?

263
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,967
THANK YOU.
- WAIT, WHY IS CHRIS CRYING?

264
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,671
- UH, HE'S EMOTIONAL.
- WAIT, WHY IS CHRIS EMOTIONAL?

265
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,640
- BECAUSE HE'S
IN THERAPY RIGHT NOW,

266
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:33,841
AND IT'S DREDGING UP
A LOT OF STUFF FOR HIM.

267
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,009
- WAIT, WAIT,
LIKE WHAT KIND OF STUFF?

268
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,878
- LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,
HIS FRIENDS ARE GETTING MARRIED,

269
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,246
AND HE'S NOT
DATING ANYONE.

270
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,214
- WHY ISN'T
HE DATING ANYONE?

271
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,250
- YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU
DATE HIM?

272
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,352
- BECAUSE I'M DATING MYSELF
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

273
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,121
I'M--I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO MAKE ME HAPPY.

274
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,790
- UGH, WHY IS IT ALWAYS
ABOUT YOU, ANN?

275
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,824
SELF-CENTERED MUCH?

276
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:55,896
- JUST GO, OKAY?
THANK YOU.

277
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,330
- RON IN 60 SECONDS.
- TOM.

278
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:58,799
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU TONIGHT.

279
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,168
- I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON MY PRESENTATION.

280
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,703
I JUST CAME BY
TO CONGRATULATE LESLIE,

281
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:03,871
AND THEN I'M HEADING BACK.

282
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,272
- I ADMIRE
THE WORK ETHIC.

283
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,708
I'M ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR NEW INVESTMENTS.

284
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,077
EVER SINCE I GOT MY FIRST JOB
AT THE AGE OF NINE,

285
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,279
I HAVE PUT
ALL MY MONEY INTO GOLD,

286
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,414
WHICH IS CURRENTLY
AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH.

287
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:20,020
SO I HAVE
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY.

288
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,189
I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.

289
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,357
LOOKING FORWARD
TO TOMORROW.

290
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,126
- YES...
ABOUT THAT.

291
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,162
I WAS WONDERING, IS THERE
ANY CHANCE WE COULD RESCHEDULE?

292
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,864
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING IS UP

293
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:31,965
TO MY WORLD-CLASS "STANDEES."

294
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,735
- I LIKE TO KEEP
MY APPOINTMENTS, SON,

295
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,203
AND I LIKE OTHERS
TO DO THE SAME.

296
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,673
- OF COURSE, YES.
NO PROBLEM, 8:00 A.M. TOMORROW.

297
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,875
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE
VERY IMPRESSED

298
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,343
WITH OUR PRESENTATION.

299
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,680
- "OUR PRESENTATION"?
WHO ELSE IS JOINING YOU?

300
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:47,815
- RICKA RICKA RICKA RICKA!

301
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:50,450
[imitating DJ scratching]

302
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,852
[whispering]
SWANSON.

303
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,687
- JEAN-RALPHIO.
- THAT'S ME.

304
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,756
- I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE A PART OF THIS.

305
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,357
- OF COURSE HE IS.
HE'S MY BUSINESS PARTNER.

306
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,761
both: [inhale sharply]
SHH! CLEAN!

307
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,730
- BUSINESS PARTNER,
NOW AND FOREVER.

308
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,866
HOLD UP!
FOREVER 21.

309
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,901
21-GUN SALUTE.
SALUTE YOUR SHORTS.

310
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,002
KABOOSH!

311
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,871
I JUST FREE-ASSOCIATED
ALL OVER THE "MOUSSE-TACHE."

312
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,873
- THAT'S JUST ONE
OF MANY SKILLS HE BRINGS

313
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:13,640
TO THIS BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP.

314
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,776
- WHAT ARE THOSE, SHRIMP?
AH!

315
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,046
OKAY.
- RETHINK THAT MOVE, SON.

316
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,849
- LET'S JUST DRIVE BACK.
I FEEL WEIRD.

317
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:24,251
- STEVE, YOU LIKE SAILING,
RIGHT?

318
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,119
- NOT ANYMORE, SINCE JULIA
GOT THE BOAT IN THE DIVORCE

319
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,988
AND THEN SOLD IT
TO A SCRAPYARD

320
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,823
BECAUSE SHE'S TERRIBLE.

321
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:30,791
- WELL, AT LEAST
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL

322
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,926
WITH ALL THAT BOAT UPKEEP NOW,
RIGHT, HUH?

323
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,261
YECH, NO THANKEE.

324
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,396
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
OTHER THAN SAILING.

325
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,798
WHY DON'T YOU HEAD
IN THE OTHER ROOM?

326
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,200
I HAVE A SURPRISE THAT--
THERE SHE GOES.

327
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,903
THERE'S A SURPRISE FOR YOU,
SO, UM, HEAD ON IN.

328
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,805
- I DON'T LIKE SURPRISES.

329
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:45,773
- OKAY, LOOK,
YOU GAVE IT A TRY,

330
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,776
BUT THIS QUILT THING
IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

331
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,277
- BEN,
ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS,

332
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,746
I HAVE USED A QUILT
TO MEND FENCES.

333
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,481
IN NINTH GRADE,
A QUILT ENDED AN ARGUMENT

334
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,749
BETWEEN MY TWO BEST FRIENDS,

335
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:57,818
AND A QUILT SETTLED

336
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,120
THE DONNA-JERRY
PARKING LOT FEUD OF 2006.

337
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,789
- WHAT WAS THE THIRD TIME?

338
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,757
- RIGHT [bleep] NOW.

339
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,158
- OKAY, I STILL DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK,

340
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,094
BUT I AM REALLY ATTRACTED
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

341
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,430
- I KNOW.
LET'S DO THIS.

342
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,531
[knock at door]

343
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,766
- POLICE, OPEN UP!
WE HAVE A WARRANT!

344
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,867
JUST KIDDING, IT'S US.

345
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,803
HA, WE GOT YOU!
- ANDY AND APRIL.

346
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,070
- WE HAVE SOMEONE
WHO WANTS TO SEE YOU!

347
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,806
- CHAMPION!

348
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,473
COME HERE.
HEY, BIG BOY.

349
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,542
YOU ARE SUCH
A BRAVE, GOOD DOG,

350
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,177
WITH SO MUCH SPIRIT.

351
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,278
YOU'VE OVERCOME SO MUCH.

352
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:30,183
YOU ARE THE MOST WONDERFUL DOG
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

353
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,785
AND I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

354
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:33,420
[sobbing]

355
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,989
- OKAY, EVERYONE, I HAVE
A SURPRISE FOR ALL OF YOU.

356
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,991
VOILA!

357
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:41,795
[both gasping]
THE KNOPE-WYATT UNITY QUILT!

358
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,898
IT REPRESENTS OUR TWO FAMILIES
COMING TOGETHER,

359
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,566
AND THERE IS A PERSONALIZED
SQUARE FOR EACH MEMBER

360
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,802
OF OUR JOINT FAMILY, SEE?

361
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:51,404
- SWEETHEART, THIS IS LOVELY.
- THANKS, MOM.

362
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,540
- WHERE'S MY SQUARE?

363
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,308
- WELL,
YOU'RE NOT TECHNICALLY--

364
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,911
- NOT TECHNICALLY WHAT?
- NOT TECHNICALLY AN ADULT.

365
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,881
- THIS IS A VERY THOUGHTLESS
OMISSION, LESLIE,

366
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,851
AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
IF THERE'S NO ULANI SQUARE,

367
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,053
THIS IS NOT
A LEGITIMATE UNITY QUILT.

368
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,088
- OH, THAT OLD CHESTNUT.
- OKAY.

369
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,324
I WILL MAKE
AN ULANI SQUARE.

370
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,994
VERY, VERY EASY.
OKAY.

371
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,395
LOOK, THIS IS YOUR SQUARE NOW.

372
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:16,864
WHAT DOES "ULANI" MEAN?

373
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,365
- "CHEERFUL."

374
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,900
- SURE.

375
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,936
ALL RIGHT.
LOOK AT THAT.

376
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,839
UNITY! IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS--

377
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,307
- I DON'T WANT HER NAME
ON MY QUILT.

378
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,476
- IT'S NOT YOUR--
IT'S EVERYONE'S QUILT.

379
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,610
IT'S A UNITY QUILT.

380
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,246
- I THINK IT'S MEAN THAT
YOU DIDN'T DO A SQUARE FOR ME.

381
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,547
- IT'S A DISASTER
IS WHAT IT IS.

382
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,349
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN,
STEVE.

383
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,318
- SEE, BEN,
THEY'RE AGREEING.

384
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,920
IT'S WORKING.

385
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:40,854
- OKAY, I'M THINKING

386
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:43,623
WE JUNK EVERYTHING
EXCEPT THE MANNEQUINS.

387
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,158
RON'S GOTTA SEE HOW DOPE
THE OUTFITS ARE.

388
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,326
THAT'S THE BUSINESS.

389
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,062
- WHY ARE WE GOING TO RON?
RON SHOULD BE COMING TO US!

390
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,898
WE CREATED
ENTERTAINMENT 720.

391
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:51,965
- WHICH WAS
A HUGE FAILURE.

392
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,166
- I DON'T KNOW--

393
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,935
- LOOK, A BANK'S
NOT GONNA GIVE US A LOAN,

394
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:58,205
AND RON LOVES
MY ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT.

395
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,307
TRUST ME, HE'S OUR BEST CHANCE
AT GETTING START-UP MONEY.

396
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,975
- I HEAR THAT.
LET'S GO CLUBBING.

397
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,443
- NO, WE GOTTA WORK.

398
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,444
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME SAY
WE GOTTA JUNK

399
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,378
MOST OF THE PRESENTATION?

400
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,015
- TOMMY, I WILL ALWAYS
BE THERE FOR YOU,

401
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,549
NO MATTER WHAT,
BUT RIGHT NOW,

402
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,252
I CANNOT BE THERE FOR YOU
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO.

403
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,988
- I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT...

404
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:18,591
SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOTTA WORK
A LITTLE,

405
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,928
SO YOU CAN BALL A LOT.

406
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,396
- THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

407
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,901
THAT CHANGED ME.
I'LL GIVE YOU TEN MINUTES.

408
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,337
- YOU HAVE TO TRY
TO EAT SOMETHING, OKAY?

409
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,977
- MMM!
WOW, THAT'S AMAZING.

410
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,147
- SEE? THERE YOU GO.

411
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,614
- THIS ONE'S NOT AS GOOD.

412
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,183
- ALL RIGHT, CHRIS,
HERE'S THE PLAN.

413
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,152
I'M JUST GONNA LIST OFF
HAPPY THINGS

414
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,054
UNTIL YOU'RE CHEERED UP.

415
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:50,323
PIZZA, THE BEACH,
ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC--

416
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,492
- AND I'LL LIST TERRIBLE THINGS
TO BRING YOU BACK DOWN.

417
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,995
SMALLPOX,
BOTCHED SURGERY,

418
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,164
SNAILS CRAWLING
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

419
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,666
- THIS IS WEIRDLY WORKING.
IT'S EVENING ME OUT.

420
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,935
- OKAY, KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING.
- LAUGHTER.

421
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:02,769
- SNAILS CRAWLING
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

422
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,004
- THE BEACH.
- SNAILS CRAWLING OUT

423
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,572
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.
- CUTE CATS.

424
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,040
- SNAILS CRAWLING
OUT OF YOUR BUTT.

425
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,708
- DAVE MATTHEWS BAND.

426
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,343
- DAVE MATTHEWS BAND.

427
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:13,246
- LOOK, DAD, LESLIE WORKED
REALLY HARD ON THIS,

428
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,715
SO CAN YOU JUST COOL IT
FOR, LIKE, 30 SECONDS?

429
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,085
- SURE, I CAN.

430
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,987
BUT YOUR MOTHER CAN'T.
SEE?

431
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,489
SHE'S RUINING YOUR QUILT,

432
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,224
JUST LIKE SHE RUINED
OUR MARRIAGE!

433
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,458
- MOM!

434
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:26,626
- OH, I DIDN'T KNOW
WE COULD CUT THAT.

435
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,727
- IT HAD TO BE DONE, BEN.

436
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,363
- IT ABSOLUTELY
DID NOT HAVE TO BE DONE.

437
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,399
- LOOK, CHAMPAGNE!

438
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,134
- YEAH, WHY DON'T WE
JUST FORGET ABOUT THE QUILT

439
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,569
AND JUST RAISE A GLASS?
- YES! TOASTS ARE FUN.

440
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,705
THEY USUALLY SIGNIFY
THE END OF A PARTY.

441
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:39,606
HERE YOU ARE, ULANI.

442
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,673
- I'M GOOD, THANKS.

443
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,575
- OH, BY ALL MEANS,
GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT, ULANI.

444
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,477
OR, WAIT, ARE YOU EVEN
OLD ENOUGH TO DRINK?

445
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:46,279
- YES, JULIA, I AM,

446
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:49,582
BUT I CAN'T
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

447
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,717
- YOU'RE WHAT?

448
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,119
- OH, BOY.
- [whines]

449
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,486
- I DIDN'T MEAN
TO STEAL YOUR SPOTLIGHT,

450
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,554
BUT THE CAT'S
OUT OF THE BAG.

451
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:59,359
YOUNG BEN IS GOING TO HAVE
A NEW BABY SISTER, HUH?

452
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,229
STILL FIRING BULLETS, SON.
[laughs]

453
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,763
- I CANNOT BE
IN THE SAME ROOM AS HIM.

454
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,265
- WHAT ABOUT THE WEDDING?

455
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,401
- I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE WEDDING.

456
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:12,039
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE WYATT FAMILY.

457
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,209
- GOD, IT'S LIKE THE WAR
OF THE WYATTS OUT THERE, HUH?

458
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:19,212
- I MEAN, IT'S SO BRUTAL!
- OH, MY GOD.

459
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,513
- WERE YOU AND DAD
EVER LIKE THAT?

460
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,515
- WELL,
LIKE ANY MARRIED COUPLE,

461
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,517
HONEY, YOUR FATHER AND I
FOUGHT OCCASIONALLY,

462
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,187
AND SOMETIMES
HE WON THE ARGUMENT,

463
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,621
AND SOMETIMES I WON.

464
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,391
BUT USUALLY, WE FORGOT
WHAT WE WERE ARGUING ABOUT

465
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,459
AND JUST HAD SEX.

466
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,594
- LA LA LA LA LA.
- ANYWAY, THE IMPORTANT THING

467
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:38,465
IS THAT WE ALWAYS ENDED UP
ON THE SAME TEAM.

468
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,799
AND IN THE SAME BED.

469
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,134
- [groans]

470
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,370
- GOD, I MISS THAT MAN.

471
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,138
- HOW CAN YOU BE SO WISE
AND SO INAPPROPRIATE

472
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,639
AT THE SAME TIME?

473
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,176
- I'M A PARENT.

474
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,310
- [sighs]

475
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,711
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO PHRASE
THIS MISSION STATEMENT.

476
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,180
- LET ME GET A SHOT AT IT.

477
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,314
I'M ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
AT THIS STUFF.

478
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,516
[whistles]
[keyboard clicking]

479
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,550
SEE?

480
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,552
- YOU JUST GOOGLED,
"AMANDA BYNES SIDE BOOB."

481
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,121
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

482
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,822
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WHY IS YOUR SAFESEARCH ON?

483
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,692
THAT IS AMATEUR HOUR, TOM.

484
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,595
LISTEN, WE'VE BEEN AT THIS
FOR AN ENTIRE EVENING.

485
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,397
I SAY, WHY DON'T
WE CUT OUR LOSSES?

486
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,732
IF IT WAS SUCH A GOOD IDEA,
WE WOULD BE MILLIONAIRES BY NOW.

487
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,833
HELLO.

488
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,602
- LOOK, MAN,
I BELIEVE IN THIS IDEA.

489
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,371
DO YOU?

490
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,507
YOU KNOW
I LOVE YOU, BUT...

491
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,409
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE AS SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS BUSINESS AS I AM.

492
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:25,812
- OH, YEAH, NO,
I'M DEFINITELY NOT.

493
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,615
[soft music,
indistinct chatter]

494
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,517
- [clears throat]

495
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,623
[sniffs]

496
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,393
- HEY, I GOT YOUR TEXT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

497
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,429
- I GRABBED ALL OF THE BROWNIES
FROM THE DESSERT TABLE

498
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:43,363
AND FOUR BOTTLES OF WINE.

499
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,731
GET IN THE CAR.
WE'RE GOING TO AUSTRALIA.

500
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,599
- LESLIE--
- I AM SO SORRY FOR EVERYTHING.

501
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,169
I LOVE YOU,
AND I WANT TO BE ON YOUR TEAM.

502
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,603
I AM ON YOUR TEAM,
BUT I THINK THAT

503
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,439
OUR TEAM SHOULD BE
FAR AWAY FROM HERE.

504
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,607
- NORMALLY, I WOULD GET
IN THE CAB WITH YOU,

505
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:57,544
BUT I AM SO SICK OF THEM
RUINING EVERYTHING,

506
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,646
AND I REALLY LIKED
THAT UNITY QUILT.

507
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,382
- IT WAS A GOOD QUILT.
- IT WAS AN AWESOME QUILT.

508
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,484
LOOK, MY PARENTS ARE INSANE,

509
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,819
BUT THEY NEED TO BE
AT OUR WEDDING.

510
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,355
YOU KNOW WHAT?

511
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,822
IT'S TIME FOR THIS TEAM

512
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,524
TO COME UP WITH A NEW PLAN.
- I AGREE.

513
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,660
PHASE ONE OF OUR NEW PLAN,
YOU GET IN THE BACKSEAT

514
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,129
OF THIS CAB, AND WE HARDCORE
MAKE OUT FOR 15 MINUTES.

515
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:17,497
- I WOULD LOVE
TO DO THAT.

516
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,332
I'M JUST NOT SURE IF THE DRIVER
WOULD BE OKAY WITH IT.

517
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,668
- FOR ANOTHER 100 BUCKS,
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

518
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,670
- LET'S DO THIS.

519
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,139
- [sniffing]

520
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,640
SWAN SONG!

521
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:28,841
WHAT UP, MY MAN?

522
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,611
OW, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- JEAN-RALPHIO.

523
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,680
I THOUGHT YOU AND TOM WERE
WORKING ON YOUR PRESENTATION.

524
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,649
- NO, I DECIDED IT WAS BEST
IF I TOOK MY TALENTS ELSEWHERE.

525
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,851
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- YOU ABANDONED YOUR FRIEND?

526
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,920
- GOD, NO.
HE FIRED ME, STRAIGHT UP.

527
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,722
TALKED ABOUT HOW I
WASN'T SERIOUS ENOUGH

528
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,790
ABOUT THE PROJECT,

529
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,592
HOW HE NEEDED TO GROW UP.

530
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,860
ANYWAY, I HAVE AN AMAZING
INVESTMENT IDEA FOR YOU.

531
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,829
CONDOMS WITH PICTURES
ON THEM.

532
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,264
- PASS.
- GOOD. SMART.

533
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,599
I THINK YOU MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

534
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,168
TAKE CARE.

535
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,537
- OH. CHRIS?

536
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,573
SEEMS LIKE THE STORM HAS PASSED.
- INDEED IT HAS.

537
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:02,742
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I SPENT
THE ENTIRE PARTY IN A ROOM

538
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,478
BEING HAPPY-SAD
ON A NIGHT THAT MEANS SO MUCH

539
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:06,746
TO MY TWO BEST FRIENDS.

540
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,315
- I MEAN,
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A LOT.

541
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,550
YOU NEED TO PURGE ALL THIS STUFF
THAT'S BEEN BUILDING UP.

542
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,885
- THIS LESBIAN NURSE
IS RIGHT, CHRIS.

543
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,787
YOU CAN'T KEEP IT
ALL BOTTLED UP.

544
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,190
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE ALL OF MY EMOTIONS

545
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:19,626
TUMBLING OUT LIKE THIS MEANS
THAT I CAN GET A CLEAN START.

546
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,960
- WELL, FOR THAT,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO VISIT

547
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,961
THE BATHROOM FIRST.

548
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,463
- RIGHT?
- NO.

549
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,631
- [laughs] ANN PERKINS!
- NOPE.

550
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,634
- YOU ARE, WITHOUT A DOUBT,
THE QUEEN OF TOILET HUMOR.

551
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:32,239
- THAT'S ALL
I EVER WANTED TO BE.

552
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,674
- THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A HAPPY OCCASION.

553
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,409
YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO COME HERE,

554
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:39,579
CELEBRATE YOUR SON'S ENGAGEMENT,
MAYBE BURY THE AX?

555
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,680
AND NOT
IN EACH OTHER'S BACK.

556
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:44,317
- BUT IT DID NOT
WORK OUT THAT WAY.

557
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,552
SO HERE IS THE NEW PLAN.

558
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,520
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO LIKE EACH OTHER,

559
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,656
BUT YOU HAVE TO COME
TO THE WEDDING, OKAY?

560
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,957
WE'LL SEAT YOU FAR AWAY
FROM EACH OTHER.

561
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,359
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO SOCIALIZE.

562
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,227
- YEAH, IN FACT,
WE INSIST THAT YOU DON'T.

563
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,795
BUT YOU DO HAVE
TO SHOW UP

564
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,497
AND TELL US
THAT YOU HAD A GREAT TIME.

565
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,465
THAT'S THE DEAL.

566
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,967
YOU CAN EITHER TAKE IT,
OR YOU CAN TAKE IT.

567
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,636
- I CAN TAKE IT.
I'M SORRY.

568
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,573
- I'M SORRY TOO, BENNY.
- SORRY. WHATEVER.

569
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,541
- AW,
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL APOLOGY.

570
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,676
- JULIA...
- GUYS.

571
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,677
both: SORRY.

572
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,445
- BEN'S PARENTS ARE INSANE,

573
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,613
BUT HE IS NOT.
HE'S AMAZING.

574
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,715
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

575
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:18,017
I GUESS HE MIGHT
BECOME INSANE AS HE AGES.

576
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,254
I SHOULD KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR THAT.

577
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,822
ALSO, FOR THE RECORD,
MY UNITY QUILT WORKED.

578
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,825
SO TECHNICALLY, I AM THREE
FOR THREE WITH UNITY QUILTS.

579
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:26,993
- WE ONLY HAVE
30 BUCKS LEFT.

580
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,361
LET'S GO.
- OH, OKAY.

581
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,462
GET READY, DRIVER.
[engine turns over]

582
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,998
WE'RE GONNA MAKE OUT SO HARD
IN THE BACK OF YOUR CAB.

583
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,739
- ARE YOU OKAY, SON?
DID YOU GET ANY SLEEP?

584
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,442
- UH, NOT REALLY.
I STAYED UP MOST OF THE NIGHT.

585
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:45,412
BUT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
[exhales sharply]

586
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,380
LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT RENT A SWAG.

587
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,548
NOW--
- NO NEED, TOM.

588
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,949
I'M IN.

589
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,885
I LIKE DOING BUSINESS
WITH SERIOUS PEOPLE,

590
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,323
AND WHEN YOU REMOVED YOURSELF
FROM THE COMPANY OF THAT MORON,

591
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,825
YOU SHOWED ME
YOU'RE A SERIOUS PERSON.

592
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,827
YOU HAVE YOUR START-UP MONEY.
- WOW.

593
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,929
I APPRECIATE IT.
[door opens]

594
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,331
- TOMMY "T"!

595
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,899
YOU JUST MISSED THE CRAZIEST
OF CRAZIES.

596
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,835
CLUBS. GIRLS. DANCING.

597
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:11,338
NAKED. MOM? ARGUMENT.

598
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,940
POLICE. FLEEING THE SCENE.
HIDING IN A DUMPSTER.

599
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:14,874
COMING HERE.

600
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,843
CRASHING ON YOUR COUCH
FOR A WEEK 'CAUSE

601
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,078
* TECHNICALLY,
I'M HOMELESS *

602
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,747
HEY, "MOUSSE-TACHE."
I'MA HIT THE COUCH.

603
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,850
YOU KNOW WHERE I BE.
