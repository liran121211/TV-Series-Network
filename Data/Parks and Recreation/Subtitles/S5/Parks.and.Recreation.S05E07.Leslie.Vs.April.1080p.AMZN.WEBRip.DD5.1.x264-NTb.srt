1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:03,571
- 2020.
- THAT'S A STRETCH.

2
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:06,040
- FINE.
2024.

3
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:08,676
I WIN,
WE MOVE IN THERE.

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,179
I'LL TAKE THE WEST WING.
YOU TAKE THE EAST WING.

5
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:13,314
YOU CAN BE THE FIRST GENTLEMAN.

6
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,383
- ACTUALLY, THAT SOUNDS
KIND OF GREAT.

7
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,518
THANKS FOR COMING WITH ME
TO GET MY STUFF.

8
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,153
- HOW COULD I PASS UP
AN OPPORTUNITY

9
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:20,288
TO LOOK AT OUR FUTURE HOUSE?

10
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,190
- OH, JUST REMEMBERED.

11
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:24,492
I KIND OF GOT YOU
AN ENGAGEMENT PRESENT.

12
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,227
- IS IT A WAFFLE TOWER?

13
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,429
- I MEAN, IT'S A LITTLE BETTER
THAN THAT.

14
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,265
[background chatter]

15
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:35,236
- CLAUDIA WELDERS.

16
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,638
- UH, THAT--
HOW DID--

17
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,540
HOW DID YOU DO THIS?
- CALLED IN A FEW FAVORS.

18
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,142
- EXCUSE ME.

19
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,743
- A FEW HUNDRED FAVORS.

20
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,312
MR. VICE PRESIDENT.

21
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:46,214
BEN WYATT FROM
CONGRESSMAN MURRAY'S OFFICE.

22
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,182
- HEY, BEN. DAVE TOLD ME
YOU WERE GONNA BE COMING BY.

23
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:49,217
AND YOU MUST BE LESLIE KNOPE.

24
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,386
WELCOME. WELCOME.
- [laughs]

25
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,257
YOU'RE--MY NAME JUST CAME OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH.

26
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,558
- WELL, YEAH, IT DID.

27
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:00,461
- THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

28
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,163
THIS ISN'T REAL.

29
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:03,331
- NO, IT'S HAPPENING,

30
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,166
AND I'M DELIGHTED
TO HAVE YOU HERE.

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,767
ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT
AND MYSELF,

32
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,169
I WANTED TO--
- OH, MR. VICE PRESIDENT,

33
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,103
I AM DEEPLY FLATTERED,

34
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:10,704
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
THAT I COULD TAKE OVER

35
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,274
MADAM SECRETARY CLINTON'S
POSITION.

36
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,209
I MEAN--
- I'M CONFIDENT

37
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,410
YOU COULD DO THAT JOB
OR ANY OTHER, BUT--

38
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:17,845
- OKAY, I WILL.

39
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,348
- WELL, THE REASON
YOU'RE HERE IS I'M TOLD

40
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,549
YOU'VE DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB

41
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,884
IN YOUR TOWN
AND IN THE STATE OF INDIANA,

42
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,253
AND I JUST WANT
TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS

43
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,720
FOR YOUR PUBLIC SERVICE.

44
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,722
- AND I JUST WANT
TO SAY THANK YOU.

45
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,224
- WELL, YOU--
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

46
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:31,259
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

47
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:34,162
HEY--
Y-YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

48
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:36,397
- YOU'RE VERY HANDSOME.
- I THINK WE'RE ALL DONE.

49
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,898
- WELL, YOU'RE VERY NICE.
- OKAY. THANK YOU.

50
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,367
- THANK--
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

51
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,434
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

52
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:43,404
- WELL--
OH, WELL, YOU WILL?

53
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,373
- THANK YOU,
MR. VICE PRESIDENT.

54
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:46,907
- Y-YOU'RE WELCOME.

55
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,243
- YOU DON'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN
TO HIM, YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

56
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:51,612
HE IS PRECIOUS CARGO.

57
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,615
[triumphant music]

58
00:01:54,648 --> 00:02:02,656
*

59
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,202
- YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY THE SAME
ACCOUNTING FIRM I ALMOST JOINED

60
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,337
LAST YEAR, AND THEY GAVE ME
A GREAT PACKAGE--

61
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,240
THREE WEEKS OF VACATION,
MATCHING 401(k),

62
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,176
AND A PRETTY SWEET WINDBREAKER.

63
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,477
- WOW.
- I'M GETTING MARRIED,

64
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:26,180
AND I WANTED
A GOOD STABLE JOB,

65
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:29,217
SO I'M GOING BACK
TO ACCOUNTING.

66
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,253
SO JUST CALL ME BOND,

67
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,856
MUNICIPAL BOND.

68
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,759
YEAH, THAT JOKE KILLED
AT THE ACCOUNTING FIRM.

69
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,261
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

70
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,330
IF IT ISN'T MR. LOOKS
AND PROFESSOR BOOKS.

71
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,432
HE'S LOOKS.
- I GOT IT.

72
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,500
- OF COURSE YOU DO, BOOKS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

73
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:49,437
- WELL, FUN FACT: BEN JUST GOT
AN AMAZING ACCOUNTING JOB.

74
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,272
REGULAR FACT:
I HAVE TO GO TO A MEETING.

75
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,842
UN-FUN FACT:
MY UNCLE JUST HAD A STROKE.

76
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,778
WELL, I'M OFF.

77
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,713
- THIS IS ACTUALLY
A CRAZY COINCIDENCE.

78
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,515
I HAVE A NEW COMPANY

79
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,951
AND COULD USE YOUR HELP
ON THE MATH SIDE OF THINGS.

80
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,354
- OH, WHAT'S THE NEW COMPANY?
- WE SPECIALIZE IN MAKING STACKS

81
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:07,655
ON STACKS
ON STACKS ON STACKS.

82
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,223
- RIGHT.
PASS.

83
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,258
- I'M KIDDING.

84
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,459
IT'S A REAL IDEA.

85
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,261
SO GET THIS--

86
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,895
KIDS ARE ALWAYS GROWING
OUT OF THEIR CLOTHES,

87
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,230
SO THEIR PARENTS DON'T WANT
TO BUY 'EM NICE THINGS.

88
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:18,299
I'M GONNA RENT
MY UPSCALE CLOTHING

89
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,234
TO MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS,
BECAUSE I DISCOVERED

90
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:23,304
I'M ROUGHLY THE SAME SIZE AS
THE AVERAGE PAWNEE 12-YEAR-OLD.

91
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,705
- THAT'S ACTUALLY
A REALLY GREAT IDEA.

92
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,540
- I KNOW. CAN YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT THE BUSINESS PLAN,

93
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:27,675
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK?

94
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,842
- SURE. WHY NOT?
- AWESOME.

95
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,444
- WASHINGTON, D.C. HAS

96
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:33,314
MORE DOG PARKS PER CAPITA
THAN MOST CITIES.

97
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,516
PAWNEE ONLY HAS TWO DOG PARKS--

98
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,685
THIS ONE
AND THAT ONE,

99
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,920
WHICH IS ALSO
AN ACTIVE PARKING LOT.

100
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,356
- CAN YOU SAY
"PER CAPITA" AGAIN?

101
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,292
I WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE
OF YOU SAYING "PER CAPITA."

102
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,893
- STOP.
- I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

103
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,861
NOW STAND NEXT TO THE SCREEN
AND THINK ABOUT

104
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,597
ALL THE STRONG FEMALE
ROLE MODELS IN YOUR LIFE.

105
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,732
- GROSS.
- APRIL CAME TO ME

106
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,535
WITH AN IDEA TO BUILD
A DOG PARK IN PAWNEE.

107
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,837
I RECOGNIZED HER POTENTIAL
A LONG TIME AGO,

108
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,806
AND SHE'S FINALLY
LIVING UP TO IT.

109
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,608
I MEAN,
I AM SO PROUD OF HER,

110
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,043
I COULD CRY.

111
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,846
AND...HERE WE GO.

112
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,047
ONE TINY CRITIQUE.

113
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,682
IF YOU DO WANT
TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY,

114
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:09,850
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO THINK A LITTLE BIT

115
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:10,984
ABOUT HOW YOU PRESENT YOURSELF.

116
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,620
- NO, THIS IS PUBLICITY

117
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,622
FOR ORIN'S
NEW PERFORMANCE ART SHOW.

118
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,757
HE'S AN ANIMAL
LIVING ON A HUMAN FARM.

119
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,859
AND YOU CAN GO AND FEED HIM
FROM YOUR OWN HAND.

120
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,394
- UGH,
THAT'S HORRIFYING,

121
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,261
AND SO IS ORIN.

122
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,129
YOU SHOULD NOT BE FRIENDS
WITH HIM.

123
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,064
- SO, AFTER REVIEWING
ALL THE OPTIONS,

124
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,400
I FOUND THAT THE BEST LOCATION
FOR THE DOG PARK

125
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,769
IS LOT 48,

126
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,338
THE ONE BEHIND ANN'S HOUSE.

127
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,606
- [laughs]

128
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,343
NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

129
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,911
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PUT
A PARK THERE FOR FOUR YEARS.

130
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,381
SEE, THE THING IS, APRIL,
THAT LOT IS MINE.

131
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:42,350
I'VE BEEN DOING
SLOW, PAINSTAKING WORK

132
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,718
SO I DON'T WANT TO WHIP OUT
THE LEGALESE ON YOU NOW,

133
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:45,786
BUT I GOT DIBS.

134
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,321
WHAT WE ARE GONNA DO

135
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:48,356
IS WE'RE GONNA TAKE
YOUR ENTHUSIASM,

136
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,723
WE'RE GONNA BUNDLE IT UP,

137
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:50,924
AND WE'RE GONNA FIND A NEW PLACE
FOR A DOG PARK.

138
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,025
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN?

139
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,628
ONE, TWO, THREE, CHEESE.
GOOD GIRL.

140
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:56,063
- GOOD MORNING, ANDY.

141
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:59,032
[clears throat]

142
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:04,438
- OKAY, SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT
ABOUT MY COMPUTER.

143
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,607
AHA.
IT'S GONE.

144
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,879
[gasps]
A GAME IS THE FOOT.

145
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,114
SEE, PART OF THE POLICE ACADEMY
ENTRANCE EXAM

146
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,584
IS INVESTIGATING A CRIME.

147
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,586
SO ABOUT A MONTH AGO
I TOLD EVERYONE IN THE OFFICE

148
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,488
THAT, AT SOME POINT,
THEY SHOULD STEAL SOMETHING

149
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,356
FROM MY DESK
SO I COULD PRACTICE.

150
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,124
LET'S DO THIS.

151
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,496
WAIT, HEY, DID YOU GUYS
TAKE MY GLASSES TOO?

152
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,498
THEY GOT MY SUNGLASSES TOO.

153
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,133
- I WAS IN MIAMI
LAST WEEKEND.

154
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,602
I TOOK MY TALENTS
TO SOUTH BEACH.

155
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,570
- HOW DO YOU SPEND
YOUR TIME IN MIAMI?

156
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,138
MAYBE FENCING
STOLEN COMPUTERS?

157
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,574
- YES, I TOOK
YOUR GOVERNMENT COMPUTER

158
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:44,044
FROM INDIANA TO MIAMI

159
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,913
TO SELL IT
ON THE BLACK MARKET

160
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,147
FOR 150 BUCKS.

161
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,751
- HA-HA, YOU DON'T KNOW IT,
BUT YOU JUST GAVE YOURSELF AWAY.

162
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,086
- GOTTA SAY,
I'M IMPRESSED.

163
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,689
YOUR MISSION STATEMENT
MADE SENSE,

164
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:58,025
AND YOU DIDN'T USE
ONE R. KELLY LYRIC.

165
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,693
- YES.

166
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,529
SO YOU WANT TO BE MY CFO?

167
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:02,796
- WELL, I ALREADY HAVE A JOB,

168
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,064
BUT I'LL HELP
AS A FRIEND.

169
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,867
AS LONG AS YOU TAKE
WHAT I SAY SERIOUSLY.

170
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,903
I DON'T WANT ANOTHER
ENTERTAINMENT 720 DISASTER

171
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,071
ON OUR HANDS.

172
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,172
- YEAH, IT WAS A DISASTER.

173
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,741
TOO BAD
WE DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.

174
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,709
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S MY FIRST MOVE?

175
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,978
- YOU KNOW, I THINK ANY
OF THE FOUR PREVIOUS LOCATIONS

176
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,147
WOULD WORK, BUT THERE'S
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PLACE.

177
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,750
IT JUST HAS
A REALLY GOOD ENERGY HERE,

178
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,118
YOU KNOW?
LOTS OF NATURAL LIGHT.

179
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,987
- IT'S TINY AND AWFUL
AND LOUD.

180
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,824
AND IT'S ZONE 14B,
INDUSTRIAL WASTE CLEAN-UP SITE.

181
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,726
WE SHOULD TECHNICALLY BE WEARING
HAZMAT SUITS RIGHT NOW.

182
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,162
- IT SEEMS LIKE THE KIND
OF PLACE A SKA BAND WOULD GO

183
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,730
TO SHOOT HEROIN.

184
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,199
- COME ON, GUYS, THIS IS
A GREAT PLACE FOR A DOG PARK.

185
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,869
I MEAN, LOOK,
THERE'S ALREADY A DOG HERE.

186
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,971
- OH, MY GOD.
I HAD THAT EXACT DOLL

187
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,138
WHEN I WAS A KID.

188
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,074
THIS IS--
THIS IS TRAUMATIC FOR ME.

189
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,777
- WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT LOT 48
IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WORKS.

190
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,844
AND I'M DEFINITELY
BRINGING IT UP

191
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,212
AT THE NEXT
CITY COUNCIL MEETING.

192
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,781
- APRIL, PLEASE,
I BEG OF YOU,

193
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,616
I WILL DO ANYTHING
TO KEEP YOU FROM DOING THAT.

194
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,950
- OKAY.
SAW OFF YOUR PINKY TOE.

195
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,185
- NO.
- SHAVE YOUR HEAD.

196
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,953
- NO.
- HAVE SEX WITH JERRY.

197
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,088
- NO.

198
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,856
- WELL, I TRIED
TO BE REASONABLE.

199
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,558
- I HAVE CREATED A MONSTER.

200
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,994
AND NOW I NEED
TO DESTROY HER.

201
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,496
WHAT DO I DO, JOE?

202
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,163
[impersonating Biden]
WELL, LESLIE,

203
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,165
LOOK INTO MY EYES,
TAKE A DEEP BREATH,

204
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,234
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

205
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,136
[self]
THANKS, JOE.

206
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,138
GOD, HE'S GOOD.

207
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,042
- RON, THANK YOU
FOR AGREEING TO SEE ME.

208
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,877
- I DIDN'T. YOU JUST WALKED
IN HERE AND STARTED TALKING.

209
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,112
- I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR A HISTORY LESSON.

210
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:29,049
LOOK, I AM TRYING
TO REMOVE PARKING METERS,

211
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,085
AND THERE IS A GUY
IN PUBLIC WORKS

212
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,721
WHO'S BEING
A REAL THORN ABOUT IT.

213
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:36,256
- WHICH GUY?
- RICKY JORDACHE.

214
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,891
- NEVER HEARD OF HIM.
WHAT'S HIS DEAL?

215
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,827
- HE'S NEW.
HE USED TO BE A SLACKER,

216
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,795
BUT NOW HE'S REALIZING
HIS FULL POTENTIAL,

217
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:42,963
BUT AT WHAT COST?

218
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,798
HE'S SMART,
AND HE'S BEAUTIFUL,

219
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,500
AND I THINK OF HIM
IN MANY WAYS AS A DAUGHTER,

220
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:47,901
BUT THAT WOULD BE CRAZY
'CAUSE HE'S A MAN

221
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,537
AND HIS NAME'S RICKY.

222
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,671
HERE'S MY QUESTION.

223
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,906
HOW DID YOU USED
TO SLOW ME DOWN

224
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,075
WHEN I WAS BECOMING
TOO ME-ISH?

225
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,844
- SOMETIMES I'D JUST GIVE YOU
BUSY WORK.

226
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,179
I ONCE HAD YOU PUT TOGETHER
A BROCHURE

227
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,915
ABOUT DIFFERENT KINDS
OF INDIANA TOPSOIL.

228
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,017
- THAT SOIL BROCHURE
WAS NOT BUSY WORK.

229
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:07,020
I MEAN, PEOPLE STILL REFER
TO MULCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.

230
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,857
- AND IF YOU WERE PARTICULARLY
AMPED UP ABOUT A PROJECT,

231
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,627
I'D TAKE YOU TO JJ'S
AND DISTRACT YOU WITH WAFFLES.

232
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,862
- THOSE WERE
DISTRACTION WAFFLES?

233
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,730
I THOUGHT
THEY WERE FRIENDSHIP WAFFLES.

234
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:19,800
- BREAKFAST FOOD CAN SERVE
MANY PURPOSES.

235
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,935
- BUT WHAT IF THIS PERSON,
THIS RICKY, WHO IS REAL,

236
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,637
DOESN'T LIKE WAFFLES

237
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:24,772
OR ANYTHING.

238
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,741
- EVERYBODY HAS SOMETHING
THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT.

239
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:30,778
JUST FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS,
EXPRESS AN INTEREST IN IT,

240
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,245
AND DIVERT HIS ATTENTION.

241
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,917
[The Farmer in the Dell plays]

242
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,919
*

243
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,153
- HOWDY, NEIGHBORS.

244
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,855
WELCOME TO HUMAN FARM.

245
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:46,059
HERE'S YOUR ANIMAL FEED.
PLEASE DON'T FEED THE ANIMALS.

246
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:51,331
- WOW, THIS IS REALLY,
REALLY COOL.

247
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,067
I LIKE THE STATEMENT IT'S MAKING

248
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:57,705
THAT, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE ALL IN CAGES IN A WAY.

249
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,240
- YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY
ABOUT DEATH AND THE CITY.

250
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,643
- YEAH.
I SEE THAT NOW.

251
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,278
HI, ORIN.

252
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,848
- MS. WICKS,
IF YOU'VE READ OUR PROPOSAL,

253
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,883
YOU'LL SEE THAT AN ALLIANCE
BETWEEN RENT-A-SWAG

254
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,786
AND SWEETUMS COULD BE
MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL.

255
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,789
- WELL, I MUST SAY
IT'S A MUCH BETTER IDEA

256
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,791
THAN THE LAST ONE YOU HAD,

257
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,760
THAT GOURMET FRENCH FOOD THING.

258
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,896
- OH, MY ESCARGOT
DELIVERY SERVICE, SNAIL MAIL.

259
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,998
SO YOU WANT TO PARTNER UP
AND MAKE HISTORY?

260
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,034
I MEAN,
YOU'VE ALREADY MADE HISTORY

AS THE WORLD'S
MOST BEAUTIFUL CEO.

262
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,938
- I'M REALLY SORRY, CUTIE.

263
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,640
THE COMPANY'S LAYING LOW
RIGHT NOW

264
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,042
DUE TO A SMALL MISHAP.

265
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,710
- AH, YES.

- WELL, ALL PRESS
IS GOOD PRESS.

269
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,286
- NO, THIS WAS BAD PRESS.

270
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,657

00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,730
WE'RE STARTING UP

TO RESTORE OUR NAME.

275
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,967
ANY INTEREST IN RUNNING IT?

276
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,837
- OH, I'M--I'M SORRY, YOU WANT
ME TO RUN YOUR NON-PROFIT WING?

277
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:06,139
- I KNOW THAT BOBBY NEWPORT
IS MY STEPSON,

JERRY--
IF THAT EVEN IS YOUR REAL NAME.

286
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,997
- IT'S NOT.
MY REAL NAME IS GARY.

- WELL, GARY--IF THAT EVEN
IS YOUR REAL NAME--

288
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,804
SOMEBODY STOLE MY COMPUTER.
NOW, IF YOU'RE A CRIMINAL,

289
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,205
LOOK AT ME,

290
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,674
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME LEGALLY,

291
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,110
OR ELSE IT'S CONSIDERED
ENTRAPMENT.

292
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,979
- I'M SORRY, ANDY.
IT WASN'T ME.

293
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,347
- OH, MAN, REALLY?

294
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,882
- NO.
- OKAY.

OKAY, SO WE KNOW
IT'S NOT JERRY,

UNLESS HE WAS LYING TO ME.

297
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,957
I CAN NEVER TELL
WHEN PEOPLE ARE LYING TO ME.

298
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,693
HOPEFULLY THAT DOESN'T COME UP
IN MY POLICE WORK.

299
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,962
- I THINK WE SHOULD DO
MORE STUFF LIKE THIS.

00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,431
YOU KNOW, I THINK PAWNEE
NEEDS AN AMAZING ARTS PROGRAM.

301
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,834
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST DROP
EVERYTHING AND COORDINATE IT.

302

- I'M NOT STUPID.

303
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,803
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

304
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,471
- IT MEANS THAT THE ONLY REASON
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE

305
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,273
IS TO DISTRACT ME
FROM THE DOG PARK.

306
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,375
YOU HATE THIS SHOW.
- I LOVE THIS SHOW.

307
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,477
- WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE PART?
- THE HEAVY-HANDEDNESS.

308
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,879
- [groans]

309
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,013
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I HAVE TO GO TALK

310
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:20,981
TO COUNCILMAN JAMM RIGHT NOW.

311
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,983
- WHY ARE YOU TALKING
TO COUNCILMAN JAMM?

312
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,284
- BECAUSE I TOLD HIM
ABOUT THE DOG PARK IDEA,

313
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,219
AND HE LOVES IT.
HE THINKS IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

314
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,988
HE'S GONNA SUPPORT MY MOTION

315
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,356
AT THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING
TOMORROW,

316
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,725
AND HE GAVE ME
A REALLY COOL DENTAL MIRROR

317
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,826
TO CHECK OUT MY MOLARS.

318
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,095
- OUR DISPUTE ASIDE,
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL WITH JAMM.

319
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,930
HE'S A SNAKE,
I'M TELLING YOU.

320
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:40,400
- YEAH, LIKE I SHOULD TRUST YOU
OUT OF ALL PEOPLE RIGHT NOW.

321
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,469
- MOO.

322
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,938
MOO.
- QUIET, WEIRDO.

323
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,439
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE A SHEEP?

324
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:49,076
- NO.
YOU ARE.

325
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,044
- [whispers] OH, SHUT UP.

326
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:54,014
- TOM WOULD MAKE
A GREAT PROFILE FOR YOUR SHOW.

WHO'S LEARNED

THROUGH AN UNBELIEVABLE SERIES
OF BONEHEAD BUSINESS MOVES.

329
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,922
- NOT TO MENTION
IN THE LAST MONTH ALONE

330
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,290
THREE PEOPLE HAVE CONFUSED ME

331
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,826
FOR A SHORTER,
INDIAN RYAN GOSLING.

332
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,895
- IT'S INTERESTING,
BUT I THINK I NEED TO WAIT

333
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,129
UNTIL THE BUSINESS
HAS BEEN AROUND

334
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,499
FOR A FEW MONTHS,
MAKE SURE IT'S VIABLE.

335
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,935
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO RAN
THE CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN

00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,403
IN WASHINGTON, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

337
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,805
- WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA
OFFER HIM A JOB?

338
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:20,007
- YES.
WE'RE LAUNCHING

339
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,509
A NEW POLITICAL CHAT SHOW,
AND WE NEED CORRESPONDENTS.

340
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,877
- OH, WELL, THANK YOU,

341
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,479
BUT I'M A LITTLE SHAKY
ON LIVE TV.

342
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,049
- THAT'S OKAY.
PEOPLE WANT AUTHENTICITY.

343
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,884
THINK ABOUT IT?
- DIDN'T YOU HEAR HIM?

344
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,052
HE STINKS ON TV.

345
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,453
HE SWEATS.
HE STUTTERS.

346
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,955
IT'S LIKE THE KING'S SPEECH,

347
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,389
BUT THE FIRST PART,
BEFORE HE'S FIXED.

348
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,558
- THAT WAS MY FAVORITE PART
OF THE MOVIE.

349
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,427
- WHAT IS HAPPENING?

350
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,962
- CHRIS TRAEGER.

351
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,530
- YUP.
HI, ANDY.

352
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,065
- I KNOW YOU DID IT.

353
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,201
- DID WHAT?
- [laughs]

354
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,938
DON'T PLAY STUPID
AND HANDSOME WITH ME.

355
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,874
YOU STOLE MY COMPUTER
SO THAT I COULD PRACTICE

356
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,043
FOR MY POLICE EXAM.

357
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,911
YOU'RE AS GUILTY
AS YOU ARE SEXY.

358
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,080
- ANDY, ANOTHER COMPUTER
WAS REPORTED STOLEN

359
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,882
FROM THE OFFICES
ON THE OTHER SIDE

360
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,016
OF THE COURTYARD.

361
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,151
I DON'T THINK

362
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,886
THIS IS PART
OF YOUR POLICE TRAINING.

363
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,888
I THINK CITY HALL WAS ROBBED.

364
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,456
- I CAN'T TELL
IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

365
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,958
REALLY?
- I THINK.

366
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,093
- LIKE A REAL CRIME?
THAT'S EVEN BETTER.

367
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,895
- NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS:

368
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,897
IT'S AGENDA ITEM 280B,

369
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,000
A MOTION TO CONSTRUCT
A DOG PARK

370
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,568
ON MUNICIPAL LOT 48.

371
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,171
- MS. LUDGATE,
YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.

372
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,605
- THANK YOU,
COUNCILMAN JAMM.

373
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,108
YOUR HELP
AND GENERAL NON-AWFULNESS

374
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,576
IS MUCH APPRECIATED.

375
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,079
LESLIE,
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL,

376
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:35,615
I BELIEVE THAT MUNICIPAL LOT 48
SHOULD BE A DOG PARK.

377
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,850
- BOO.
BOO.

378
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:39,853
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S
CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION TO THIS,

379
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,121
SO I'M SORRY,
MS. LUDGATE,

380
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,555
YOU SHOULD GO NOW.

381
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,224
- REALLY?
I JUST HEARD ONE HAG BOOING.

382
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,460
- LADIES, PLEASE,
LET'S KEEP THIS CIVIL.

383
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,030
- COUNCILMAN,
PAWNEEANS,

384
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,632
SATISFIED CUSTOMERS
OF JAMM ORTHODONTICS,

385
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,336
AS WE DISCUSS WHAT TYPE OF PARK
TO PUT ON LOT 48,

386
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,071
I HAD A THOUGHT.

387
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,873
HOW ABOUT NO PARK?

388
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:02,509
WHO HERE THINKS
PARKS ARE STUPID?

389
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,045
LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT
EVERYONE IS RAISING THEIR HANDS.

390
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,415
I HAPPEN TO KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT PAWNEE'S FAVORITE

391
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,351
FAST FOOD RESTAURANT, PAUNCH
BURGER, NEEDS A NEW LOCATION.

392
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,021
NOW, SEEING AS HOW THE FUTURE
OF LOT 48 IS OPEN

393
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,623
FOR DEBATE, I MOVE
WE SELL IT TO PAUNCH BURGER

394
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,558
FOR A NICE PROFIT.

395
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:22,963
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE ASIAN
TO DO MATH THAT SIMPLE.

396
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,631
- YOU TOLD ME
YOU WANTED A DOG PARK.

397
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,466
- UH, PSYCH.

398
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,501
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.
YOU LIED TO ME.

399
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,370
- YOU JUST GOT JAMMED.

400
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,205
- I HATE
WHEN HE SAYS THAT.

401
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,575
- I TOLD YOU
THAT JAMM WAS A SNAKE.

402
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,110
- WELL, IT TAKES A SNAKE
TO KNOW A SNAKE.

403
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:38,578
- SO NOW I'M A SNAKE?
- YES.

404
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,914
YOU DECEIVED ME
FOR TWO STRAIGHT DAYS,

405
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,315
AND YOU EAT MICE.

406
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,650
- I DON'T EAT MICE.
- YES, YOU DO.

407
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:44,651
YOU'RE A MOUSE EATER.
MOUSE EATER.

408
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,186
MOUSE EATER.
- ENOUGH!

409
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,155
YOU ARE FRIENDS
AND COWORKERS.

410
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:51,491
IN THIS OFFICE, WE TREAT
EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT.

411
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,626
- HEY, APRIL,
HOW IS THAT DOG PARK COMING?

412
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,129
- GET OUT, JERRY.
- THIS IS PRIVATE!

413
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,431
- SORRY, GUYS.

414
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,367
- WE ARE NOT LEAVING HERE
UNTIL YOU TWO FIGURE THIS OUT.

415
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,035
RON, GUARD THE DOOR.

416
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,170
- YES, SIR.

417
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:07,507
- NO ONE LEAVES THE OCTAGON.

418
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,708
I DATED AN ULTIMATE FIGHTER.

419
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,577
IT WAS LIKE A THING HE SAID.

420
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,679
- WHAT'S THE PLAY HERE,
OFFICER?

421
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,047
YOU GONNA SET UP A PERIMETER,

422
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,582
MAYBE BUG A FEW PHONES?

423
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,683
OOH, I KNOW.
WE COULD PUT OUT

424
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:17,951
A DUMMY COMPUTER
FOR THEM TO STEAL,

425
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:19,519
FILL IT WITH EXPLOSIVES FIRST,

426
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,155
[clicks tongue]
BOOM, TAKE 'EM ALL OUT.

427
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,457
- YEAH, WE'RE NOT DOING
ANY OF THAT.

428
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,559
- ANDY, I LOVE YOUR ENTHUSIASM,
BUT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE

429
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,595
THE KIND OF MONEY TO LAUNCH
A MASSIVE INVESTIGATION.

430
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:32,132
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA FILL OUT
THIS STUPID REPORT

431
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:33,000
AND THAT'S IT?

432
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,301
AS A FUTURE COP,
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

433
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,635
I CANNOT LET THIS GUY GO.

434
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,006
- LOOK, MAN, THIS IS
WHAT MOST POLICE WORK IS.

435
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,108
JUST WRITING STUFF DOWN.

436
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,576
IT'S NOT SUPERHERO TIME.

437
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,345
IF IT SOUNDS BORING,

438
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,114
MAYBE YOU OUGHT
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

439
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,018
- MAYBE WE SHOULD FIND
THE PERSON

440
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:54,187
WHO STOLE
HIS POSITIVE ATTITUDE.

441
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,722
- HEY, MAN.

442
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,058
- HEY, MAN.
GET ANY MORE JOB OFFERS

443
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,526
SINCE I LAST SAW YOU?

444
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,561
- YEAH, BUT IT WAS
JUST A MANAGEMENT POSITION

445
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:02,562
AT URBAN OUTFITTERS.

446
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,064
I TURNED IT DOWN.

447
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,698
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
MAYBE I CAN'T HACK THIS.

448
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,400
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE
A CUE FROM YOU

449
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,469
AND STICK
WITH MY BORING DAY JOB.

450
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,372
- WELL, MY ACCOUNTING JOB
ISN'T BORING.

451
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,606
- IF IT WAS
REMOTELY INTERESTING,

452
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,574
THERE WOULD BE A SHOW
ON A&E ABOUT IT.

453
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,676
THEY HAVE A SHOW
ABOUT STORAGE UNIT AUCTIONS.

454
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,578
- FAIR POINT.

455
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,680
LOOK, IF YOU'RE PASSIONATE
ABOUT THIS,

456
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,449
KEEP AT IT.
THINGS WILL TURN AROUND.

457
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,684
ALSO CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT TIME

458
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,154
THAT SHOW
ABOUT STORAGE UNITS IS ON?

459
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,156
- 9:30.

460
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,159
- [sighs] ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO FORCE THIS.

461
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,227
LESLIE,
MAYBE YOU WANT TO ADMIT

462
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:35,662
THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
THE GREATEST ROLE MODEL.

463
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,330
- I DON'T CARE.
ORIN'S MY ROLE MODEL.

464
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,299
- APRIL, MAYBE YOU WANT
TO ADMIT

465
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,600
THAT YOU'VE BEEN
A LITTLE SELFISH

466
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,769
AND INCONSIDERATE.

467
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,705
- LOOK, ALL I EVER WANTED WAS
FOR YOU TO SHOW THE ENTHUSIASM

468
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,774
YOU SHOWED FOR YOUR DOG PARK,
AND, WHEN YOU DID,

469
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,676
I BLEW IT.

470
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,411
AND I'M SORRY.
- FINE.

471
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,281
I'M SORRY THAT I OUTSMARTED
YOU AT EVERY TURN.

472
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:57,317
- APRIL.
- AND I KNOW I HAVE A LOT

473
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,519
TO LEARN FROM YOU,
AND I'M SORRY

474
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,654
THAT I DISRESPECTED
YOUR STUPID DREAM.

475
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,557
- A LOT OF LOVE
IN THIS ROOM.

476
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,627
- I'M VERY, VERY SORRY.
- ME TOO.

477
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,662
- I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

478
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,131
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS
IN FRONT OF HER.

479
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,765
- OKAY.
- OKAY, ANN,

480
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,135
SINCE YOU'RE SUCH A GENIUS,
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

481
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,636
- NEITHER OF YOU WANT JAMM
TO WIN, NOR DO I,

482
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,505
BECAUSE I HATE PAUNCH BURGER,

483
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,340
BUT, IF THERE IS ONE IN
MY BACKYARD, I WILL EAT THERE,

484
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,675
LIKE, EVERY NIGHT,
AND THAT IS NO GOOD.

485
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,078
SO I SAY WE STOP PLAYING DIRTY
WITH EACH OTHER,

486
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,846
AND WE START PLAYING DIRTY
WITH JAMM.

487
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,781
- YES.
WE'LL HAVE TRIPLE-SEX WITH HIM.

488
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,850
- NO. I HAVE AN IDEA.
IT'S VERY UNCOOL,

489
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,552
BUT IT'S NOT ILLEGAL,
TECHNICALLY,

490
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,787
BUT IT IS A DICK MOVE.

491
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:35,788
- I LOVE IT.

492
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,490
- HEY, CAPTAIN.

493
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:38,558
STATUS UPDATE:

494
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,661
MY NEW SUSPECT--THE DUDE
WHO RUNS CARPET EMPORIUM.

495
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,163
THE WAY I FIGURE IT IS,

496
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,798
CRIMINALS LOVE TO WRAP THINGS
UP IN RUGS.

497
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:49,169
PLUS, HE YELLED AT ME WHEN I
TRIED TO UNROLL 'EM ALL, SO...

498
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,637
- ANDY, WHILE I APPRECIATE
YOUR DEDICATION

499
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,604
TO FINDING THIS CRIMINAL,

500
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,573
I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

501
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,574
WHAT THE POLICEMAN SAID.

502
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,875
- I MEAN, GOSH,

503
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,646
IF I CAN'T EVEN INVESTIGATE
BAD GUYS,

504
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,249
WHY BECOME A COP AT ALL?

505
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,683
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

506
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,651
- WHEN I GET BUMMED OUT,
I TAKE MY SHIRT OFF

507
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,819
BECAUSE THE BAD FEELINGS
MAKE ME FEEL SWEATY.

508
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,521
[groans]

509
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,623
YOU KNOW WHAT,
MAYBE I SHOULD BAIL

510
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:11,691
ON BEING A COP.

511
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:15,662
- CITY HALL NEEDS
A NEW PART-TIME SECURITY GUARD

512
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:16,796
FOR THE WEEKENDS.

513
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,897
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

514
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,699
LOOK AT IT AS A WAY
TO FEEL OUT

515
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:20,633
WHETHER YOU WANT
TO BE A POLICE OFFICER.

516
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,902
BUT, KEEP IN MIND,
IF YOU TAKE THIS JOB,

517
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,372
YOU MUST KEEP YOUR CLOTHES ON
AT ALL TIMES,

518
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,439
EVEN IF YOU GET SAD.

519
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:29,176
- NO DEAL.

520
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,277
OKAY, I'LL DO IT.

521
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,745
- THAT A BOY.
- I'LL DO IT. I PROMISE.

522
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,214
AND I GET A GUN,

523
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,715
AND I CAN POINT IT
IN PEOPLE'S FACES.

524
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:36,883
- INCORRECT.

525
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,452
[dog barking]

526
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,255
- HEY.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

527
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,357
- OH, HELLO, COUNCILMAN.

528
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,159
THE DOGS ARE HERE
BECAUSE THERE'S NO DOG PARK

529
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,695
IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD,
AND THE KIDS ARE HERE

530
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,330
BECAUSE THERE'S NO HUMAN PARK
IN YOUR AREA.

531
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,165
THEY ALL NEEDED
A PLACE TO PLAY.

532
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,366
- MY FRONT LAWN?

533
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,367
- THAT'S RIGHT,

534
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:55,468
AND THEY'RE GONNA KEEP USING IT

535
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,604
UNTIL THERE'S
AN ACTUAL PARK NEARBY.

536
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,472
- HEY, HEY, LADY,
GET THAT THING OFF MY GNOME.

537
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,574
HE IS DRY-HUMPING
MY GARDEN GNOME.

539
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,646
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME

AND, IF YOU PLOW THROUGH
AND IGNORE US,

541
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,350
THIS IS GONNA BE YOUR LIFE.

542
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,285
- I'LL CALL THE POLICE.

543
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,754
- YEAH, SIC THE POLICE
ON A BUNCH OF KIDS AND PUPPIES.

544
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,890

545
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,592
GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT.

546

00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,735
I WANT THAT HULA HOOP
OFF MY 'VETTE.

560
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,756
- I JUST SAID,
"LET'S GET TO WORK."

561
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,424
HOW ELSE DO PEOPLE ENJOY THINGS?

562
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,662

00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,773

570
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,876

BUT I JUST DON'T WANT

00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:38,037
I NEED TO MOVE MY LIFE
IN ANOTHER DIRECTION.

583
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,574
- THIS IS DISAPPOINTING.
AGAIN.

584
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,644
MAYBE SOMEDAY WE'LL FIGURE OUT
THE MAGIC FORMULA

585
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,646
THAT GETS YOU TO WORK HERE.

586

594
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:09,736
I DON'T KNOW.
LIFE IS SHORT.

595
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,804
WHY BE AN ACCOUNTANT,
YOU KNOW?

596
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:14,874
I MEAN, OTHER THAN THE STABILITY
