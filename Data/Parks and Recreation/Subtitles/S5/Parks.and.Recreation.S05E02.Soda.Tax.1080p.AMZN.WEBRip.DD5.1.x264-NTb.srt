1
00:00:01,035 --> 00:00:02,136
- ANDY AND LESLIE
SENT US CARE PACKAGES.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,405
- "HEY, BEN, JUST A FEW THINGS
TO REMIND YOU OF HOME.

3
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:05,439
LOVE, LESLIE."

4
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:07,241
AH, WAFFLE MIX.

5
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:08,742
JJ's DINER MUG.

6
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,711
NEW PAJAMAS.

7
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,081
WOW, THERE'S A LOT
OF STUFF IN HERE.

8
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:15,649
"BOX 1 OF 12"?

9
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,452
- "APRIL, HERE'S SOMETHING
TO HELP YOU REMEMBER

10
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,488
OUR THREE-LEGGED DOG
CHAMPION."

11
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,422
- AH, THAT'S CUTE.

12
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,091
- "ALSO, YOU ARE WAY BETTER
AT LAUNDRY.

13
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,593
"CAN YOU PLEASE DO MINE
AND SEND IT BACK TO ME?

14
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:28,362
THANKS. LOVE YOU.
MOUSE RAT RULES. LOVE, ANDY."

15
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:29,463
- LESS CUTE.

16
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:30,698
- "P.S. PLEASE HURRY.

17
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,400
"I'VE BEEN WEARING
A BANDANA AS UNDERWEAR

18
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,401
FOR THREE DAYS NOW."

19
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:35,069
LOOK, THERE'S A PICTURE.

20
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:37,705
- AH!
THAT'S HORRIFYING.

21
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,608
- [sighs]

22
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,776
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

23
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,779
[triumphant music]

24
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:53,821
*

25
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,433
- OKAY, SO DO YOU HAVE
THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY?

26
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,667
- YES, AND THEY'RE GREAT.

27
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,369
YOUR TAX ON SODA

28
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,471
WOULD DEFINITELY
LOWER DIABETES IN THIS TOWN.

29
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,640
OH, AND I HAVE A GREAT PROP
FOR THE MEETING.

30
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,275
THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR

31
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,277
THAT THE AVERAGE PAWNEE
10-YEAR-OLD CONSUMES,

32
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,479
FROM SODA, EVERY MONTH.

33
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,680
- THAT IS GROSS.
- IT'S GROSS.

34
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,682
- ALL THAT SUGAR?
- IT'S REALLY GROSS.

35
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,484
- WHAT A POWERFUL IMAGE.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:24,718
- WHAT DID YOU PUT IN THE SUGAR?
IT'S SO GOOD.

37
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,720
MY FIRST ACT
AS A CITY COUNCILWOMAN--

38
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:29,623
I'VE PROPOSED A TAX ON
ALL THOSE GIANT SUGARY SODAS

39
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,692
SO WE CAN DISCOURAGE PEOPLE
FROM DRINKING THEM.

40
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,294
I BELIEVE, WITH MY HELP,

41
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,196
ALL LOCAL RESTAURANTS
CAN GET HEALTHIER--

42
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,698
PAUNCH BURGER, BIG AND WIDE,
THE FAT SACK,

43
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,633
CORONEL PLUM'S SLOP TROUGH--

44
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,635
WHICH WAS FORMERLY
SUE'S SALADS

45
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,372
UNTIL WE RAN THAT
OUT OF TOWN.

46
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,674
- AH, COUNCILWOMAN.

47
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,442
IN HONOR OF
YOUR NEVER-ENDING QUEST

48
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:50,178
TO PERSONALLY BABYSIT

49
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,745
EACH AND EVERY
AMERICAN CITIZEN,

50
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,448
I WENT TO PAUNCH BURGER
AND GOT MYSELF A NUMBER TWO--

51
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:57,518
DOUBLE BACON GRENADE DELUXE,
HASH BROWNS,

52
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,720
CHILI CHEESE FRIES,
AND ONE POACHED EGG.

53
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,722
- UGH!
NUMBER TWO IS RIGHT.

54
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,758
- I ALSO PICKED UP A 64-OUNCE
SWEETUMS SUGAR SPLASH.

55
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,594
DAMN IT, I LOVE THIS COUNTRY
SO MUCH.

56
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,297
- RON, I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

57
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,265
OUR POLITICAL DIFFERENCES
ASIDE,

58
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,434
I AM ABOUT TO GO TO
MY FIRST COMMITTEE MEETING

59
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,704
AS A CITY COUNCILWOMAN.

60
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,406
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO SAY TO YOU.

61
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,640
- PLEASE DON'T.

62
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,375
- I KNOW YOU HATE
FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS,

63
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,477
BUT I WOULD NOT BE WHERE I AM
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

64
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:26,280
YOU HIRED ME.
YOU'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED ME.

65
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,715
HOW CAN I EVER REPAY YOU?

66
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,183
- [slurps]

67
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:30,384
GET ME A REFILL.

68
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,555
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

69
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,290
SO, I'VE BEEN GOING
OVER YOUR REPORTS.

70
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:40,361
LET'S TRY TO BE CONSISTENT
WITH OUR FONTS, GUYS, OKAY?

71
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,595
THERE'S A CRAZY AMOUNT

72
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,432
OF RANDOM FONT DIFFERENCES
IN THESE MEMOS.

73
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:47,601
- YEAH, PEOPLE.
CONSISTENT FONT USAGE. COME ON.

74
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,304
- TIMES NEW ROMAN,
ACROSS THE BOARD.

75
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:53,674
NO GENEVA, NO GARAMOND,
DEFINITELY NO PAPYRUS.

76
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,376
- PAPYRUS?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

77
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,745
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THAT IN
A PROFESSIONAL OFFICE SETTING.

78
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,447
- YES!
THANK YOU, APRIL.

79
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,717
THESE COLLEGE INTERNS REALLY
NEED TO BE WHIPPED INTO SHAPE,

80
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:06,487
BUT DON'T WORRY, BECAUSE
THEY CALL ME DEVO,

81
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,789
'CAUSE I CAN
"WHIP 'EM GOOD."

82
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,794
AND OBVIOUSLY MAKE SURE
THE CONTENT'S PERFECT TOO.

83
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,664
OH, AND, UH, 12 POINT.

84
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,767
13'S JUST OBNOXIOUS.
GREAT MEETING.

85
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,669
- OUT OF THE WAY, PEOPLE.

86
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,537
MOTIVATIONAL BRIGADE
COMING THROUGH.

87
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,339
- HO HO!

88
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:27,975
- SO, YOU BOYS ARE GONNA GO
WORK OUT TOGETHER, HUH?

89
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,312
NICE. WHEREABOUTS?
- COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

90
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,480
- EH, THAT'S TOO FAR.

91
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,482
- CHRIS AND TOM OFFERED
TO HELP ME TRAIN

92
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,949
TO BECOME A POLICE OFFICER.

93
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:39,353
THE PHYSICAL EXAM IS
ABOUT THREE MONTHS AWAY

94
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:46,460
AND I AM IN TERRIBLE SHAPE,
BUT I CAN ALREADY DO THIS...

95
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:48,929
SO, I'M GETTING THERE.

96
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,030
SO, I'VE GOT
A LIST OF EVERYTHING

97
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,098
THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO
BE ABLE TO DO

98
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,367
TO GET INTO THE POLICE ACADEMY,
AND NUMBER ONE IS,

99
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:56,504
"BE ABLE TO RUN 2 MILES
IN UNDER 25 MINUTES."

100
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,705
THAT'S A TYPO, RIGHT?

101
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,806
I MEAN,
THAT'S HUMANLY IMPOSSIBLE.

102
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,642
- WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO FOCUS
YOUR MIND AND YOUR BODY,

103
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,511
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

104
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,980
- ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!

105
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,849
- MS. PINEWOOD,

106
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,718
RECENTLY, MANY OF
THE LOCAL RESTAURANTS

107
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,654
HAVE CHANGED THEIR
"SMALL-SIZE" OPTION

108
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,524
TO A WHOPPING 64-OUNCES.

109
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,792
- THAT'S CORRECT, AND IT'S
GREAT FOR THE CONSUMER.

110
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,428
MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK.

111
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,530
ARE WE PUTTING BARGAINS
ON TRIAL HERE?

112
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,732
- HOW COULD ANY SANE PERSON
CALL THAT "SMALL"?

113
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,834
- WELL, IF THE CUSTOMER
TRULY WANTS A SMALLER SIZE,

114
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,001
THERE IS AN OPTION.

115
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,871
- OH, DO YOU MEAN
THE "LI'L SWALLOW"?

116
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,773
DOES ANYBODY BUY THAT?

117
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:33,974
- SOME GIRLS BUY THEM
FOR THEIR DOLLHOUSES,

118
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,776
BUT THEY'RE NOT
VERY POPULAR.

119
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,478
I MEAN, FOR ONLY
A NICKEL MORE,

120
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,979
YOU GET 64 OUNCES.

121
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,883
- WELL, UH, PAUNCH BURGER
JUST RECENTLY CAME OUT

122
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:47,388
WITH A NEW 128-OUNCE OPTION.

123
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,790
MOST PEOPLE CALL IT
A GALLON,

124
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:50,824
BUT THEY CALL IT
THE "REGULAR."

125
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:54,962
THEN, THERE IS A HORRIFYING
512-OUNCE VERSION

126
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,698
THAT THE CALL "CHILD SIZE."

127
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,768
HOW IS THIS
A "CHILD-SIZE SODA"?

128
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,537
- WELL, IT'S ROUGHLY THE SIZE
OF A TWO-YEAR-OLD CHILD,

129
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:04,838
IF THE CHILD WERE LIQUEFIED.

130
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,441
IT'S A REAL BARGAIN
AT $1.59.

131
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:08,709
- I'M SORRY, MS. PINEWOOD,

132
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,444
BUT WHY WOULD ANYBODY
NEED THIS MUCH SODA?

133
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:12,613
- IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO SPEAK
FOR THE CONSUMER,

134
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,649
BUT EVERYONE SHOULD BUY IT.

135
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,718
- COME ON, ANDY, COME ON.
YOU CAN DO IT.

136
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,052
GO, GO, GO, GO,
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

137
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,121
DIG, DIG, DIG, DIG, DIG,
DIG, DIG, DIG, DIG.

138
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,656
- AAH!
- YES!

139
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,824
- OH, MY GOD.

140
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,727
IT'S SO HOT.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

141
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,930
OH, I'M GOING TO DIE.
I'M SO TIRED.

142
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,666
[groans]
EVERYTHING HURTS.

143
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,968
RUNNING IS IMPOSSIBLE.
[groans]

144
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,737
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

145
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,039
- TOM, NOW IS NOT THE TIME
FOR CRITICISM.

146
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,307
HOW DID HE DO?

147
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,777
- ANDY FINISHED HIS TWO-MILE RUN
IN 29 MINUTES AND 43 SECONDS.

148
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:47,415
- NO! I'M NEVER
GONNA BE A COP.

149
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:48,849
I'M GONNA HAVE TO BE
A ROBBER.

150
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,518
- OH, COME ON.
HANG IN THERE, PAL.

151
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,919
I'M GONNA DRIVE AROUND.

152
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:55,789
- [groans]
- ANDY, I'M PROUD OF YOU.

153
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,125
NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID,
WHICH WAS TERRIBLE,

154
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,094
BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT I'M GOING TO
BE ABLE TO GET YOU TO DO.

155
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,763
I GUESS I'M PROUD OF ME.

156
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:03,731
- THANKS, MAN.
ME TOO.

157
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,400
- WE HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO.

158
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,801
- OH, HEY, ELLIS,

159
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,570
HAVE YOU PUT THE CAMPAIGN
PICTURES UP ON THE WEBSITE?

160
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:13,507
- OH. YEAH.
I STARTED DOING THEM.

161
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,710
- AND ARE YOU GOING TO
FINISH DOING THEM?

162
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,847
- OH.
LATER, MAN.

163
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,083
- [sighs]

164
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,489
- I ACTUALLY THINK
YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD,

165
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,091
EXCEPT FOR THE STICK
UP YOUR BUTT.

166
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,693
- WHO DO YOU THINK DREW IT?

167
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,695
WAS IT NATHANIEL?
ELLIS?

168
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,664
MAN, I FEEL LIKE
THESE INTERNS

169
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,166
DO NOT RESPECT
OR LIKE ME AT ALL.

170
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,168
- HONESTLY, YOU COULD
LOOSEN UP A BIT

171
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,636
ON THE FONT STUFF.

172
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,573
- [sighs]
- AND EVERYTHING IN GENERAL.

173
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,174
- GOD, THIS IS INSANE.
THEY'RE INTERNS.

174
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:50,077
THEY'RE TOTALLY REPLACEABLE,
AND I'M THEIR BOSS.

175
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,680
JUST FIRE THEM.

176
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,181
- UH, HEY, JEN.

177
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,750
LISTEN, I'M HAVING A PROBLEM
WITH SOME OF THE INTERNS.

178
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,719
I'M THINKING OF
MAKING SOME CHANGES.

179
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,721
YEAH.

180
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,458
TURNS OUT ELLIS IS
CONGRESSMAN MURRAY'S NEPHEW.

181
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:07,695
NATHANIEL IS RELATED
TO DONALD RUMSFELD.

182
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,830
BRITTANY'S DAD IS
BEN BERNANKE'S DENTIST.

183
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,765
EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THESE LITTLE TWERPS

184
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,133
IS SERIOUSLY CONNECTED.

185
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,668
SO, NEW PLAN.

186
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:17,505
INSTEAD OF FIRING THEM,

187
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:20,774
I AM GOING TO KISS
THEIR ASSES LIKE CRAZY.

188
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:24,144
- MS. KNOPE, THIS IS ABOUT
CONSUMER RIGHTS,

189
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,747
AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO
DRINK OUR DELICIOUS SODAS,

190
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,783
WE DO PROVIDE HEALTHIER
OPTIONS, LIKE WATER ZERO.

191
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:32,152
- OH, YES. LET'S TALK
ABOUT WATER ZERO.

192
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,788
THE NAME IMPLIES THAT
THERE ARE ZERO CALORIES,

193
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:37,491
LIKE MOST WATER,
BUT IN FACT,

194
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,693
IT HAS 300 CALORIES
PER SERVING.

195
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,695
ISN'T THAT MISLEADING?

196
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:42,830
- THE ZERO ON THE LABEL

197
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:43,964
REFERS TO THE AMOUNT
OF WATER IN IT,

198
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,098
WHICH IS ZERO.

199
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,935
IF YOU WANT
ZERO-CALORIE WATER,

200
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,737
TRY DIET WATER ZERO LITE.

201
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,505
IT HAS ONLY 60 CALORIES.

202
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,673
- OKAY, I THINK
WE'RE DONE HERE.

203
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:53,807
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

204
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,510
- OH, COUNCILWOMAN,
ONE MORE THING.

205
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,712
IF YOUR TAX BILL PASSES,

206
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,781
LOCAL RESTAURANTS
WILL HURT BADLY.

207
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,816
WE'LL HAVE TO LAY OFF
ABOUT 100 PEOPLE.

208
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,586
- YOU'RE BLUFFING.
SHE'S BLUFFING.

209
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,054
ARE YOU BLUFFING?

210
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,956
- THE SECOND
YOUR TAX BILL PASSES,

211
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,860
THIS PRESS RELEASE
GOES WIDE.

212
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,662
SEE YOU AT THE MEETING.

213
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:18,832
- "LESLIE KNOPE SODA TAX
FORCES MASSIVE LAYOFFS."

214
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,534
OH, MY GOD, ANN.
I NEED SOME SUGAR.

215
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:21,869
- NO, NO. NO, NO, NO!
STOP IT!

216
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,737
LESLIE, YOU STOP IT
RIGHT NOW!

217
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,074
- OKAY, LET'S GET STARTED.

218
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,008
I PROPOSED THIS BILL,

219
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,910
BUT THE ISSUE HAS BECOME
VERY COMPLICATED,

220
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,145
SO BEFORE I DECIDE HOW
I AM GOING TO VOTE,

221
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,847
I'D LOVE TO HEAR
FROM BOTH SIDES.

222
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:34,948
WHO'D LIKE TO START?
YES.

223
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,617
- YEAH, I WORK
AT COLONEL PLUMP'S,

224
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,951
AND WORD AROUND
THE SLOP TROUGH IS,

225
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,319
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
LAYING PEOPLE OFF.

226
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,321
SO, MAYBE YOU COULD GET OFF
YOUR HIGH HORSE

227
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,590
AND HELP ME KEEP MY JOB.

228
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,456
- YEAH!
- YEAH!

229
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,759
- WELL, SIR, I MAY VOTE
AGAINST THE TAX,

230
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:47,961
BECAUSE, FRANKLY, I DON'T
TAKE JOB LOSSES LIGHTLY.

231
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,229
- NO. I WANT THE TAX.

232
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,331
MY HUSBAND STARTED DRINKING
THOSE GIANT SODAS,

233
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,834
AND HE'S GAINED 100 POUNDS
IN THREE MONTHS.

234
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,869
CONSEQUENTLY, WE HAVEN'T
HAD SEX IN TEN YEARS.

235
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,270
- I-I THOUGHT YOU SAID

236
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,772
HE GAINED WEIGHT
IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS.

237
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,007
- WELL, WE HAVE LOTS
OF OTHER PROBLEMS.

238
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,109
- WELL, MA'AM,
MY ORIGINAL STANCE

239
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,877
WAS THAT IMPLEMENTING
THIS TAX

240
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,112
WOULD BE GOOD
FOR PUBLIC HEALTH.

241
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,881
- ALL TAXATION IS THEFT!

242
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,116
IF THE GOVERNMENT
CAN TAX ME,

243
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,984
I-I CAN--I CAN DO THIS.

244
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,020
- GROVER, GIVE THAT WOMAN
HER PURSE BACK.

245
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,322
- THERE'S A LOT OF
PILL BOTTLES IN HERE.

246
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,323
- OKAY.

247
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,993
- BEEN MAKING SOME MODIFICATIONS
TO THE PACE CAR.

248
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:24,097
SPEAKER SYSTEM, MAD MEN BAR,
iPAD DOCK, AND BAM!

249
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,633
ORANGE RACING STRIPE.

250
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,768
IT'S A PERFECT RECREATION
OF HAN LUE'S NISSAN

251
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,037
IN THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS:
TOKYO DRIFT.

252
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,240
WEIRDLY, SO FAR,
NO ONE HAS NOTICED.

253
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,810
- I WANT TO FIND SOMETHING
THAT REALLY MOTIVATES YOU.

254
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:38,912
WHY DO YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE
THIS GOAL?

255
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:41,014
- I JUST WANT TO GET
A GOOD JOB FOR ME AND APRIL.

256
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:43,383
- YES! KEEP GOING. DIG.
- OKAY, YEAH.

257
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,920
UH, I LOVE APRIL.
I THINK SHE'S AWESOME.

258
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,889
SHE'S ALL I CARE ABOUT
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

259
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,058
- YES. LOVE AND FAMILY.
- [laughs]

260
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,660
- WHAT ELSE IS THERE,
REALLY?

261
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,194
- NOTHING AT ALL.

262
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,163
- I EXERCISE BECAUSE,
WHEN I WAS A BABY,

263
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,665
I HAD
A RARE BLOOD DISORDER,

264
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,032
AND I SUPPOSE
I NEED TO FEEL

265
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,033
LIKE MY BODY'S
IN TIP-TOP SHAPE...

266
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,002
- AH.

267
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:05,673
- SO IT DOESN'T DESTROY ME,
LEAVING ME TO DIE ALONE.

268
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,875
- GREAT. YOU GOT YOURS,
I GOT MINE.

269
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:11,178
I'M GONNA GO RUN
TILL I PUKE. LET'S GO.

270
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,313
- GUESS WHAT'S IN THESE BOXES,
EVERYBODY?

271
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:17,751
WHAT? PIZZA.
THAT'S RIGHT.

272
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,087
EVERYBODY CHILL OUT.
TAKE A PIZZA BREAK ON ME.

273
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,692
ELLIS, WHAT'S UP, MY MALE?
YOU GRAB A SLICE OF 'ZA, BRAH.

274
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,026
- ALL RIGHT.

275
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,095
- HEY, DUDE,
DO YOU PLAY ULTIMATE?

276
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,429
- YEAH, I PLAY INTRAMURAL
AT GEORGETOWN.

277
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,299
- DUDE, SO DID I,
IN COLLEGE.

278
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,967
- WHOA, YOU GUYS
SHOULD GET MARRIED.

279
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,336
- WE SHOULD PLAY TOMORROW
MORNING IN THE PARK.

280
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:40,007
- WHAT ABOUT THE WEBSITE?
- WHATEVER.

281
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,842
YOU CAN PUT THOSE PICS UP
ANYTIME.

282
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,744
WE SHOULD LOCK DOWN
SOME TIGHT DISC GRABS,

283
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:44,745
AM I RIGHT, ELL-BONES?

284
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,346
- YEAH, IT SOUNDS GOOD.
- YEAH?

285
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,981
- IT'S BETTER THAN WORKING.
- [laughs]

286
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,316
NO DOUBT, NO DOUBT.

287
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,984
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP,
PIZZA LOVERS.

288
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:56,089
TOMORROW MORNING, PRE-WORK
ULTIMATE IN THE PARK.

289
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:58,025
EVERYBODY'S INVITED.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

290
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,393
LET'S DO IT TO IT,
MY DUDES.

291
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,897
- OKAY, ANYONE ELSE?

292
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,799
- YEAH, IF WE PUT
A TAX ON SODA,

293
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,267
I MEAN, WHAT'S NEXT,
INCOME?

294
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,102
- SIR, YOU DON'T PAY
YOUR INCOME TAX?

295
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,904
- WHETHER OR NOT
I PAY INCOME TAX

296
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,272
IS NONE OF
THE GOVERNMENT'S BUSINESS.

297
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,942
- OH, WELL, NO,
ACTUALLY, IT IS.

298
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,810
- WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW MY NAME
OR WHAT I LOOK LIKE,

299
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,045
SO GOOD LUCK FINDING ME.

300
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,081
- I THINK WE SHOULD TAX
ALL BAD THINGS,

301
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:25,352
LIKE RACISM
AND WOMEN'S VAGINAS.

302
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,120
- WE'RE NOT TAXING
ANYONE'S GENITALS.

303
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,089
- THEN WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING HERE?

304
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,124
COME ON, BOYS.

305
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,495
- OKAY, UM, LET'S TAKE
A QUICK STRAW POLL.

306
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,966
HOLD UP GREEN IF YOU AGREE
AND RED IF YOU DISAGREE. ANN?

307
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,435
- "THE SODA TAX IS GOOD AND WILL
HELP PEOPLE GET HEALTHIER."

308
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,171
- SO, ABOUT HALF?
- HALF.

309
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:49,409
OKAY, "THE SODA TAX IS BAD
AND UNFAIR TO CONSUMERS."

310
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,078
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THIS IS VERY CONFUSING.

311
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:51,912
- I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

312
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,947
MAYBE INSTEAD OF ME
LOSING MY JOB,

313
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:55,282
YOU OUGHT TO LOSE YOUR JOB.

314
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,150
LET'S RECALL LESLIE KNOPE.

315
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,186
[applause]

316
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,158
- LET'S DO THIS!

317
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,159
NICE CATCH!

318
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:09,029
SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME
WE KODAKED THAT MOMENT.

319
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,031
YEAH,
ROCKED THAT SCOOBER!

320
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:15,268
WHOA! YOU GOT IT, HOWIE!
[applause]

321
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,937
ALL RIGHT, APRIL,
WHAT'S THE SCORE?

322
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,972
- 1,000 TO 7.

323
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:21,074
- GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP, BRO.

324
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,442
SORRY.

325
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,044
- ANDY, REPEAT AFTER ME.
- OKAY.

326
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,946
- "I RUN FOR APRIL."
- I RUN FOR APRIL.

327
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,015
- RUN FOR YOUR WIFE, SON!

328
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,850
- "I RUN FOR LOVE."
- I RUN FOR LOVE.

329
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,084
- PLAYAZ, AT YOUR MARKS.

330
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,352
- WHAT DO YOU RUN FOR AGAIN,
CHRIS?

331
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:35,488
- NOBODY. NOTHING.
DOES IT REALLY EVEN MATTER?

332
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:39,059
- GET SET.
GET AT ME!

333
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,093
[thud]

334
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,161
- WHOA!

335
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,529
- OH, HEY, YOU OKAY?

336
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:45,032
- NO. THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH MY BODY.

337
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,434
- WHAT?
- MY LEGS AREN'T WORKING.

338
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,069
I'M BROKEN.

339
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,571
I NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL
AND SEE A DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY.

340
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,906
- HEY.

341
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,908
- YIKES. YOU LOOK WEIRD.
- SO DO YOU.

342
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,210
THAT'S A LIE.
YOU ALWAYS LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

343
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,946
OKAY, WELL, I COULDN'T SLEEP
A WINK LAST NIGHT,

344
00:12:58,979 --> 00:12:59,880
SO AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING,

345
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,882
I WENT TO PAUNCH BURGER
FOR A PICK-ME-UP.

346
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,416
I COULDN'T DECIDE
WHAT KIND OF SODA I WANTED,

347
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,085
SO I HAD THEM PUT ALL SIX
IN ONE CUP.

348
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,086
YOU KNOW WHAT IT TASTES LIKE?

349
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,387
- DISGUSTING?
- MM-HMM.

350
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,156
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA VOTE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

351
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,291
IF I VOTE FOR THE TAX,
THEN I MIGHT LOSE MY JOB,

352
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,325
AND IF I VOTE AGAINST IT,

353
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,094
I MIGHT BE BETRAYING
MY OWN BILL.

354
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,964
IT'S LIKE I'M FLOATING IN
THIS GIANT RIVER OF AMBIGUITY.

355
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,499
I'M UNDER A WARM WATERFALL
OF UNCERTAINTY.

356
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,934
- DO YOU JUST HAVE TO PEE
REAL BAD?

357
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,502
- YES.
- YEAH.

358
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,437
- I'VE LOST
ALL OF MY INSTINCTS.

359
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,506
I'M LOST. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

360
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,441
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO WAIT,
AND WHEN THEY CALL MY NAME,

361
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,944
I'LL DO WHAT MY GUT
TELLS ME TO DO.

362
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,245
[gavel bangs]

363
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,547
- COUNCILMAN HOWSER?
- AYE.

364
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,249
- COUNCILMAN HOWSER
VOTES AYE.

365
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:39,352
COUNCILWOMAN KNOPE,
HOW DO YOU VOTE?

366
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,990
- OH, NO.

367
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:43,991
[vomits]

368
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,558
[onlookers react
with disgust]

369
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,027
[vomiting continues]

370
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,561
[coughs]

371
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:49,997
UHH!

372
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,102
GENTLEMEN, IT APPEARS
THAT I HAVE FALLEN ILL.

373
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,972
MAYHAPS, MIGHT I SUGGEST
THAT WE HAVE A RE--AAH!

374
00:13:59,006 --> 00:13:59,973
[vomits]

375
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,909
CAN WE TAKE A RECESS?

376
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,312
- WELL, YOUR PULSE
IS SUPER FAST,

377
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,246
BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE OUT OF
LINE FOR SOMEONE WHO DRANK

378
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,882
AND THEN BARFED UP
A GALLON OF SUGAR WATER.

379
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,350
- WOW, I'M A MESS.

380
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,152
EVERYTHING'S UPSIDE-DOWN,
YOU KNOW?

381
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,921
I MEAN, WHEN I USED TO
JUST WORK HERE,

382
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,288
I WAS ALWAYS
SO SURE OF MYSELF.

383
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,090
NOW EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT.

384
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:20,193
- JEEZ. DO YOU GUYS KNOW
HOW TO DISSOLVE SUPER GLUE?

385
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,329
- WELL, NOT EVERYTHING'S
DIFFERENT, RIGHT?

386
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,566
- RIGHT.

387
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,668
- (imitates Rob Schneider)
HEY, ELLIS.

388
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:35,642
ELL-BOW. ELL-CHUPACABRA.
DRINKIN' COFFEE.

389
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:39,312
- WHAT?
- OH, IT'S--IT'S A--

390
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,581
IT'S FROM 40 YEARS AGO.
NEVER MIND.

391
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,085
HEY, THAT WAS REALLY FUN
THIS MORNING, HUH?

392
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,086
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

393
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,387
- YEAH, TOTALLY.
- [laughs]

394
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,258
- UH...
- OH, WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

395
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,227
[laughs]
DID YOU DRAW THAT?

396
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,363
- UH, NO, I DIDN'T.
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

397
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,597
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

398
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,301
I MEAN, YOU'RE A--
YOU'RE A GREAT ARTIST.

399
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,235
OH, I CAN'T DO THIS.

400
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,073
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
WHO YOU'RE RELATED TO.

401
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,441
I'M YOUR BOSS, AND YOU CAN'T
KEEP DISRESPECTING ME LIKE THIS.

402
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:13,146
- HEY, MAN, I DIDN'T DRAW IT.
YOUR DAUGHTER DID.

403
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,116
- WHAT?
- HER.

404
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,285
- APRIL'S NOT MY DAUGHTER.
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

405
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:21,388
DOES EVERYONE THINK
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER? WHATEVER.

406
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,092
THE POINT IS, SHE WOULD
NEVER DO THAT TO ME.

407
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,094
- SORRY, DAD.

408
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,136
- RON, MY ROCK,
MY STEADY, GUIDING LIGHT.

409
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,005
O CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN.

410
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,373
- DID YOU GET THAT SODA REFILL
I ASKED FOR?

411
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,474
- I NEED YOU, RON, OKAY?
I'M IN BIG TROUBLE.

412
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,343
I NEED TO GO BACK TO
THOSE CHAMBERS IN 20 MINUTES,

413
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,577
AND I HAVE TO CAST A VOTE,

414
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,979
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA DO.

415
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:47,180
- I'M SURE
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

416
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:48,748
- RON, THE PEOPLE
AT THE PUBLIC FORUM

417
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,250
SAID THEY MIGHT
WANT TO FIRE ME.

418
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,651
- SO WHAT?
I'VE TRIED TO FIRE YOU.

419
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,620
- [laughs]

420
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,288
OKAY, RON, COME ON.
BE SERIOUS.

421
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,191
- I WAS NOT JOKING.

422
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:01,094
HERE IS YOUR PERSONNEL FILE.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

423
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:05,232
- "BRILLIANT WORK."
"COMMENDATION."

424
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:06,566
"ABOVE AND BEYOND."

425
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,567
- KEEP READING.

426
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,238
- "REQUEST
FOR TERMINATION"?

427
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,373
YOU TRIED TO FIRE ME ONCE?

428
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,243
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
I TRIED TO FIRE YOU FOUR TIMES.

429
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:22,015
- WHAT--YOU--ME--FOU--
FOUR--FIRED--TIMES?

430
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:24,484
- IF YOU NEED TO BOOT AGAIN,
THE TRASH CAN'S ON YOUR RIGHT.

431
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:29,089
- HEY, MAN, WHAT'D THE DOC SAY?
EVERYTHING OKAY?

432
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,158
- THE TESTS AND BLOOD WORK
CAME BACK,

433
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,226
AND THE NEWS IS TERRIBLE.

434
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,463
- [gasps]
- THEY FOUND NOTHING.

435
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,165
- NOTHING?

436
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:41,268
- NOTHING. THE SILENT KILLER.
- OH, MY GOD.

437
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,535
- CHRIS, THAT MEANS
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

438
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,437
WHY WEREN'T YOU
AT PRACTICE THIS MORNING?

439
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:45,638
- YEAH, YOU SHOULD HAVE
BEEN THERE.

440
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,140
I FINALLY HIT
MY MINIMUM REQUIREMENT.

441
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:49,442
MINIMUM CHAMPION!

442
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,178
- I'M GOING TO DIE ONE DAY,
PROBABLY,

443
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,246
WITHOUT EVER HAVING
LEFT MY MARK

444
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,315
ON THIS SILLY,
LITTLE PLANET.

445
00:16:55,348 --> 00:17:01,054
I'M GONNA DIE AN ANONYMOUS,
MEANINGLESS SPECK OF DUST.

446
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,289
- WOW.

447
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,290
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
REALLY GOING THROUGH

448
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,291
SOME TOUGH STUFF
RIGHT NOW.

449
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:08,261
IT'S TOO BAD THERE'S NOT
DOCTORS FOR YOUR MIND.

450
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:09,462
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HEY,

451
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:10,630
I'M GONNA GO RUN
SOME MORE LAPS.

452
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,499
WILL YOU TIME ME?
GO.

453
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,800
- HE'S KIND OF RIGHT,
CHRIS.

454
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,102
YOU WERE FREAKING OUT

455
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,703
BECAUSE YOU WERE
THINKING ABOUT ANDY

456
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,605
AND HIS FAMILY
AND HOW YOU DON'T HAVE ONE.

457
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,507
EVERY TIME SOMETHING TINY
GOES WRONG,

458
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,809
YOU SPIRAL LIKE CRAZY.

459
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:26,146
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SEE
A THERAPIST.

460
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,714
I HOPE I'M NOT OUT OF LINE.

461
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:31,751
- AU CONTRAIRE, MON FRERE.

462
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,622
YOU ARE AS "IN LINE"
AS A PERSON CAN BE.

463
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,559
YOU ARE A GENIUS
AND AN AMAZING MOTIVATOR.

464
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,695
- [groans]
WHAT WAS MY TIME?

465
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,465
- I DON'T KNOW. 43.
- YES! NEW RECORD.

466
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:51,104
- ALL MY LIFE, I HAVE TRIED
TO ACHIEVE EXTERNAL GOALS.

467
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:54,541
RUN A FOUR-MINUTE MILE,
CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST.

468
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,676
BUT BEFORE I CAN DO THAT,

469
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:00,780
I NEED TO CLIMB
THE MOUNT EVEREST

470
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,216
OF MY MIND.

471
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,452
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY DID
YOU TRY TO GET ME FIRED?

472
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:08,655
- THE FIRST YEAR YOU WORKED
HERE, YOU DROVE ME NUTS.

473
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,857
I WOULD SAY NO TO SOMETHING
YOU WANTED TO DO,

474
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,325
AND YOU'D IGNORE ME

475
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,726
OR GO OVER MY HEAD
AND DO IT ANYWAY.

476
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,795
YOU WERE INSUBORDINATE,
STUBBORN,

477
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,265
A PAIN IN MY ASS,
AND, WORST OF ALL, BUBBLY.

478
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,267
- I WAS A DEDICATED
PUBLIC SERVANT.

479
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,402
- RIGHT. THAT WAS
THE WORST THING YOU WERE.

480
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,171
THE POINT IS, I ENDED UP

481
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,573
WITHDRAWING ALL FOUR REQUESTS
TO HAVE YOU FIRED,

482
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,807
BECAUSE, ULTIMATELY,

483
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,410
I'D RATHER WORK WITH
A PERSON OF CONVICTION

484
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,545
THAN A WISHY-WASHY KISS-ASS.

485
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,315
- WELL, I HAD CONVICTION BECAUSE
I KNEW WHAT I BELIEVED IN,

486
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,649
BUT I KNOW
WITH THIS NEW JOB.

487
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,386
I-I JUST FEEL LIKE
I'VE LOST MY BEARINGS.

488
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,853
- NO, YOU HAVEN'T.

489
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,223
YOU MAY HAVE WANDERED
INTO UNKNOWN TERRAIN,

490
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,458
BUT YOU'RE STILL YOU.

491
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,260
YOU KNOW WHAT?

492
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,595
- ARE YOU GONNA PULL OUT

493
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,897
SOME EMBARRASSING PHOTO OF ME
FROM HIGH SCHOOL?

494
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,367
- A COMPASS. ALL GREAT
ADVENTURERS NEED ONE.

495
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:57,337
- THANK YOU, RON.

496
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,407
AND, LOOK, AS FAR AS
THIS FIRING STUFF GOES,

497
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,276
I WON'T FORGET AND I WILL
NEVER FORGIVE YOU.

498
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,578
- THERE SHE IS.

499
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,248
- HERE'S THAT REPORT
YOU WANTED, BOSS.

500
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:11,284
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT HAS
30 DIFFERENT FONTS ON IT,

501
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,652
AND YOU ONLY LIKE ONE.

502
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,922
DO YOU LIKE IT?
- YEAH, IT'S HILARIOUS.

503
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,391
- OKAY, I'M SORRY I DREW
THOSE PICTURES OF YOU.

504
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,726
I WAS JUST MESSING AROUND.

505
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,694
- LOOK, YOU MAY NOT
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY,

506
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:24,464
BUT THIS JOB
IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

507
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,533
AND BY THE WAY,
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT SERIOUSLY,

508
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,435
BECAUSE I ASKED YOU
TO COME WORK HERE

509
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,536
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU'D ENJOY IT

510
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,737
AND I THINK YOU'RE SMART,

511
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,241
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME
SEMBLANCE OF PROFESSIONALISM,

512
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:37,710
AND I NEED YOU TO GIVE, LIKE,
EVEN A 15% EFFORT.

513
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,912
- 12%.
- 15.

514
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,914
FOR GOD'S SAKE, I'M ASKING
FOR 15% EFFORT.

515
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:43,983
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
A NEGOTIATION.

516
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:48,288
- FINE. I'M SORRY. 15.

517
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,793
- CITY COUNCILWOMAN KNOPE,
HOW DO YOU VOTE?

518
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:59,232
- AYE.
STRONGLY IN FAVOR.

519
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,901
- THE SODA TAX MEASURE PASSES,
3-2.

520
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,336
[gavel bangs]

521
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,471
- YES, I'M VERY PLEASED
WITH MY VOTE

522
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,373
BECAUSE I VOTED
MY CONSCIENCE.

523
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,541
AND BY THE WAY,
SHE'S TOTALLY BLUFFING

524
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,343
ABOUT LAYING PEOPLE OFF,
YOU WATCH.

525
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,346
ANYWAY, I MAY HAVE MADE
SOME ENEMIES TODAY,

526
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,414
BUT THAT IS
PART OF THE JOB.

527
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,515
AND WHO KNOWS,
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE,

528
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,850
MY ENEMIES WILL BECOME
MY FRIENDS.

529
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,619
STRANGER THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED.

530
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,889
- LET'S KEEP IT DOWN
OUT THERE.

531
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,291
[door slams]

532
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,492
- [sighs]

533
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,562
- YEAH, I LOVE CUPCAKES.

534
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,631
- ELLIS HATES YOU,
AND HE HAS HERPES.

535
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,934
- HEY, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
- MY PROBLEM IS YOU, SMELLIS.

536
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,603
BEN TOLD YOU
TO FINISH THE WEBSITE,

537
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,037
AND IF YOU DON'T DO IT,
I SWEAR TO GOD,

538
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,906
I'M GONNA MURDER YOU
IN YOUR SLEEP.

539
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,541
I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.
14TH STREET, RIGHT?

540
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,842
I'M GONNA GET A MELON BALLER

541
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,944
AND SCOOP YOUR EYES OUT
AND EAT THEM,

542
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,747
AND YOUR CONGRESSMAN UNCLE
IS GONNA HAVE TO BUY YOU A DOG

543
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,849
TO DRAG YOUR EYELESS FACE
AROUND.

544
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,484
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

545
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:54,854
- YES.

546
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:55,855
[slap]

547
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:56,889
DO IT.
