THE DRAMATIC TALE

00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:19,353
I'M YOUR HOST DERRY MURBLES,

9
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,789
SITTING IN FOR NINA JOPLIN,

10
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,758
WHO IS TOURING THE COUNTRY
PERFORMING A SPOKEN-WORD OPERA

11
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,161
ABOUT PEAR-SHAPED WOMEN.

12
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:30,831
MY GUEST TODAY
IS CITY COUNCILWOMAN

13
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,433
LESLIE KNOPE.

14
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,602
- IT IS A PLEASURE
TO BE BACK, DERRY.

15
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:37,705
YOUR SHOW LAST WEEK
ON DOLPHIN LACTATION

16
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,274
WAS JUST RIVETING RADIO.

17
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:44,312
DERRY, MY TEAM AND I
ARE TRYING TO BUILD A PARK,

18
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:47,181
AND WE NEED INPUT ON THE DESIGN

19
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:50,184
FROM YOU,
THE CITIZENS OF PAWNEE.

20
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:53,187
SO I GUESS I'M HERE
TO SEND OUT THE BAT SIGNAL.

21
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,224
- A BAT SIGNAL, FOR
LISTENERS WHO MIGHT NOT KNOW,

22
00:00:56,224 --> 00:01:00,794
REFERS TO THE CHILDREN'S
CHARACTER "THE BAT MAN"

23
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:04,198
A STRONG GENTLEMAN
WHO FIGHTS CRIME NOCTURNALLY.

24
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:06,200
- THAT'S CORRECT.
WELL PUT.

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,770
THIS PARK IS GOING TO BE
A CELEBRATION OF PAWNEE

26
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,540
BY PAWNEE AND FOR PAWNEE.

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,343
SO, YOU KNOW,
SEND IN YOUR PLAN

28
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:17,478
OR YOUR RESUME...

PLEASE. HURRY.

30
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:22,250
THIS IS ALL GONNA FALL APART
IF YOU DON'T HURRY.

31
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,817
- COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK,

32
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,853
MOVIE REVIEWS
WITH KEN TUCKER

33
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:28,489
WHO IS FILLING IN
FOR DAVID BIANCULLI

34
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,259
WHO'S IN NEW YORK
FILLING IN FOR KEN TUCKER.

35
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,228
LESLIE, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO INTRODUCE THE NEXT SEGMENT?

36
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:35,696
- OKAY.

37
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,700
"NOW IT'S TIME FOR
'JAZZ PLUS JAZZ EQUALS JAZZ,'

38
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,436
"TODAY WE HAVE A RECORDING
OF BENNY GOODMAN

39
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:46,240
PLAYED OVER A SEPARATE
RECORDING OF MILES DAVIS."

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,144
[both recordings playing
simultaneously]

41
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:54,515
- RESEARCH SHOWS THAT OUR
LISTENERS LOVE JAZZ.

42
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,917
[simultaneous music continues]
*

43
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,920
[triumphant music]

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:08,262
*

45
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,873
- ALL RIGHT,
SO THIS IS A LETTER

46
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,875
FROM WHAT LOOKS LIKE
A FEDERAL PENITENTIARY.

47
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,277
"HERE'S A MODEL

48
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,645
"OF WHAT I THOUGHT THE PARK
COULD LOOK LIKE.

49
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,681
ALSO, I'M INNOCENT.
PLEASE FIND ME A LAWYER."

50
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,283
I'M GETTING KIND OF WORRIED.

51
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,786
I MEAN, WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED
ONE USABLE IDEA SO FAR.

52
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,188
- HANG ON.
LOOK AT THIS GUY.

53
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,424
"30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE

54
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:39,960
"WITH A DEGREE IN ARCHITECTURE
FROM THE ROYAL DANISH ACADEMY

55
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,662
OF FINE ARTS IN COPENHAGEN."

56
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,465
- WOW! BEAUTIFUL FOUNTAIN.

57
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:47,301
PERFECTLY MANICURED SHRUBBERY.

58
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,303
THIS IS LIKE
PARKS DEPARTMENT PORN.

59
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,804
THIS GUY IS GREAT.

60
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,873
I DON'T CARE IF HE'S SOME
JUNKIE WAR CRIMINAL PIMP.

61
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,542
I AM NOT GONNA
CHANGE MY MIND.

62
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,278
- HIS NAME'S WRESTON ST. JAMES.
HE'S FROM EAGLETON.

63
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,646
- OH, I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

64
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,614
I'M NOT BEING MELODRAMATIC
WHEN I SAY

65
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:01,815
THAT PEOPLE FROM EAGLETON
ARE SNOBBY AND EVIL,

66
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:04,218
AND THEY LOOK DOWN ON PAWNEE,
AND THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY

67
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,619
EXTERMINATE EVERYONE
WHO ISN'T FROM EAGLETON

68
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,222
IF THEY WEREN'T SO BUSY
BEING OBSESSED WITH THEMSELVES.

69
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,258
[exhales]
GOD, THAT WAS CLOSE.

70
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,792
SOMETIMES WHEN I RANT
ABOUT EAGLETON,

71
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,694
I FORGET TO BREATHE,
AND I PASS OUT.

72
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,663
NO. WE CANNOT HAVE
SOMEONE FROM EAGLETON

73
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:16,864
DESIGN A PARK FOR PAWNEE.

74
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,501
WE HAVE HAD A BLOOD FEUD
THAT HAS LASTED FOR 200 YEARS.

75
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,403
- WELL, WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME,

76
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,305
AND HE IS THE FIRST
DECENT CANDIDATE.

77
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,507
SO LET'S AT LEAST
GO MEET THE GUY.

78
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:27,741
- YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

79
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,343
THEN WE CAN REJECT HIM
FACE-TO-FACE.

80
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,412
I LIKE YOUR PLAN.

81
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:34,448
- FRIENDS, FORMER LOVERS,

82
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,617
ACQUAINTANCES, JERRY,

83
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:39,387
I INTRODUCE YOU
TO THE FUTURE HOME OF...

84
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:40,888
RENT-A-SWAG!

85
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,556
- YIKES.

86
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,526
- MUCH LIKE WOMEN IN
'90s STAND-UP COMEDY ROUTINES,

87
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,027
TOMMY BE SHOPPING.

88
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,929
I STARTED A BUSINESS WHERE I
RENT MY FANCY CLOTHES TO TEENS

89
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,531
SO THEIR PARENTS DON'T HAVE TO
BUY THEM NICE THINGS

90
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,032
THEY'LL JUST GROW OUT OF.

91
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,034
SO IF YOU SEE
A 14-YEAR-OLD KID

92
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,837
WEARING A LOUIS VUITTON CRAVAT,
YOU KNOW WHO TO THANK.

93
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:57,938
ME.

94
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,841
AND LOUIS VUITTON FOR MAKING
SOME DOPE-ASS CRAVATS.

95
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,277
- SON, I LOVE WILDLIFE,

96
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,513
BUT IS A STORE
THE BEST PLACE FOR IT?

97
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:08,282
- HELP.
- THE PLACE NEEDS SOME WORK,

98
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,384
BUT THIS IS A GREAT LOCATION.

99
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,820
LOTS OF FOOT TRAFFIC,
NO METERED PARKING.

100
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,822
AND IT'S WELL WITHIN
MY FISCAL RANGE.

101
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,924
- GOOD USE OF THE WORD FISCAL,
TOMMY--VERY UP-SCALE.

102
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,593
- VERY IMPRESSIVE.
WATCHING YOU GIVES ME FAITH

103
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,629
THAT ANYONE CAN REINVENT
THEMSELVES.

104
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,030
- TOMMY TIMBERLAKE IS DEAD.

105
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,867
LONG LIVE THOMAS M. HAVERFORD,
RESPONSIBLE TYCOON.

106
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,003
- HELP.
I CAN'T MOVE.

107
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,342
- HE DESIGNED THIS PLACE?
WHAT A DUMP.

108
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:35,976
- BEN!
LESLIE. HI!

109
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,611
- HI.
- WRESTON ST. JAMES.

110
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,348
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
- NO, THANK YOU.

111
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:41,549
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF OUR NEWEST PARK?

112
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:45,018
- EH. IN A WORD, UNDERWHELMING.
AND A LITTLE INCONVENIENT.

113
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,754
THERE'S NO TRASH CANS ANYWHERE.

114
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,021
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH MY GARBAGE,

115
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,523
JUST THROW IT ON THE GROUND?

116
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,692
- THANK YOU FOR THE TRASH!

117
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,527
- MR. ST. JAMES,
I HAVE TO SAY,

118
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,463
THIS PARK IS INCREDIBLE.
- THANK YOU.

119
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:58,566
ITS OFFICIAL NAME
IS "FIVE MILE GROUNDS",

120
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,602
BUT WE LIKE TO CALL IT
"WIDE SMILES ABOUND."

121
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,771
- BECAUSE OF ALL THE SMILES
THAT OCCUR?

122
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,906
- [chuckles]
IT'S SO BORING.

123
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,040
- COME ON, I'LL TAKE YOU GUYS
ON A LITTLE TOUR.

124
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,610
- GREAT.
HE SEEMS SUPER-COOL.

125
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,413
- HE SEEMS COOL.
JUST YOU WAIT.

126
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,348
WELL, THEY ALWAYS
WINE AND DINE YOU FIRST,

127
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,016
BUT THE FACT
OF THE MATTER IS

128
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,919
EAGLETONIANS ARE,
WITHOUT EXCEPTION,

129
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,488
SNOBBY,
CONDESCENDING JERKS.

130
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:23,991
THIS IS THE PAWNEE SIDE
OF OUR BORDER WITH EAGLETON...

131
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,460
AND THIS IS
THE EAGLETON SIDE.

132
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,599
- AH.
UHH.

133
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:32,700
HEY, BABE, IT'S ME.

134
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,602
WILL YOU COME DOWN HERE, PLEASE,
AND KEEP ME COMPANY?

135
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,404
I'M SO BORED.
I NEED YOU.

136
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,972
- IF I COME DOWN THERE,
CAN I AT LEAST BREAK SOMETHING?

137
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,674
- OF COURSE, BABY.
ANYTHING. YOU KNOW THAT.

138
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,410
CHRIS GAVE ME
THIS GREAT JOB

139
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,677
AS A WEEKEND SECURITY GUARD
AT CITY HALL.

140
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,447
ONLY ONE PROBLEM--
IT'S A TERRIBLE JOB.

141
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,148
I DID EVERYTHING
I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO,

142
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,883
AND I WALKED AROUND
THE BUILDING FOUR TIMES.

143
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,118
ONLY 20 MINUTES
HAS GONE BY.

144
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:53,053
UGH! THOUGHT MAYBE
TEN MINUTES HAD GONE BY

145
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,022
SINCE I STARTED TALKING.

146
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,590
IT'S ONLY BEEN 15 SECONDS.

147
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,927
[deep sigh]
OHH...

148
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,729
OH, BABE,
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

149
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:04,164
I GOT SO BORED, I STARTED
THINKING ABOUT EXISTENCE--

150
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,600
"DO I MATTER?
DO ANY OF US?

151
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,670
IS THERE A MASTER PLAN
IN THE WORKS, A GRAND DESIGN?"

152
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,139
JUST DUMB STUFF LIKE THAT.
- UGH! WHO CARES?

153
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,074
- [sighs] I THOUGHT BEING
A SECURITY GUARD

154
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,476
WOULD BE EXCITING.

155
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,077
NOPE.

156
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,146
- WAIT A MINUTE.

157
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:22,983
ISN'T THIS HOW ALL GREAT
BERT MACKLIN CASES START?

158
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,154
IT'S QUIET.

159
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,124
A LITTLE TOO QUIET.

160
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,994
- AS YOU CAN SEE, WE LIKE TO
KEEP THINGS QUITE IMMACULATE.

161
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,064
I REMEMBER WHEN PAWNEE
HAD THAT MASSIVE SEWAGE OVERFLOW

162
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,932
IN CIRCLE PARK--
WHATEVER HAPPENED WITH THAT?

163
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,002
- WE TOTALLY FIXED IT.
- WELL, EXCEPT FOR THE SMELL.

164
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,072
THE SCIENTISTS THINK IT'S GOING
TO LINGER FOR ANOTHER 40 YEARS.

165
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,508
- CAN WE JUST CUT
TO THE CHASE HERE?

166
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:50,110
WHY WOULD A FANCY
EAGLETON ARCHITECT LIKE YOU

167
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,113
WANT TO DESIGN
A TINY PAWNEE PARK?

168
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,748
- WELL, I HEARD YOUR PLEA
ON THE RADIO,

169
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,049
AND YOU WERE SO PASSIONATE
ABOUT THE PROJECT.

170
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,118
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
IT'S A GIANT PARK LIKE THIS

171
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,920
OR A LITTLE TINY
POCKET PARK.

172
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,154
IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE.

173
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,056
WE'RE HERE TO SERVE THEM.

174
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,858
- HEY, MR. ST. JAMES!

175
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,660
- OH, OUR BALLOON ARTISAN
IS OUT OF BALLOONS.

176
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,529
EXCUSE ME.

177
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,498
- I HAVE CHILLS.
LOOK AT MY ARM.

178
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,132
- WHY ARE YOU SO CHARMED
BY HIM?

179
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,535
YOU'RE LIKE A SOUTHERN BELLE
WHEN RHETT BUTLER COMES AROUND.

180
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,604
- YES. RHETT BUTLER.
THAT'S WHO HE REMINDS ME OF.

181
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:17,871
OR BONO!

182
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,139
- WHAT?

183
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,908
NO ONE FROM EAGLETON
HAS EVER WANTED TO HELP

184
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,511
ANYONE FROM PAWNEE
FOR ANY REASON.

185
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,713
IN 1988,
WE WERE HIT BY A TORNADO.

186
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,080
WE ASKED EAGLETON FOR HELP,

187
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,650
AND THEY CLAIMED
THEY WEREN'T HOME.

188
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,554
AN ENTIRE TOWN
CLAIMED THEY WEREN'T HOME.

189
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,022
I DON'T TRUST THAT GUY
FOR A SECOND.

190
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,657
- LESLIE, LOOK WHAT WRESTON
COMMISSIONED

191
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,225
FROM THE BALLOON ARTISAN.

192
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,760
IT'S US.

193
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,799
- GREAT WORK, TEAM.

194
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,201
DONNA, YOU AND YOUR WORK
ARE RAVISHING, AS USUAL.

195
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,838
ANN, GREAT ORGANIZATIONAL
SKILLS.

196
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,840
- WOW. GENUINE PRAISE.

197
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,576
- IT'S A TIP I PICKED UP FROM
LEE IACOCCA'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

198
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,244
A SMALL CONNECTION BETWEEN
YOU AND YOUR WORKERS

199
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,278
HELPS BUILD LOYALTY.

200
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,014
JERRY!
HOW'S THE OLD TICKER?

201
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,083
- OH. WELL, UH,
THE REHAB IS GRUELING--

202
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,852
- GREAT!
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

203
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,887
YO, ROOMBA, DROP A BEAT!

204
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,656
- * HI HO, HI HO

205
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,824
- RENT-A-SWAG
IS GONNA BE THE OPPOSITE

206
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,159
OF ENTERTAINMENT720.

207
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,094
THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE.

208
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,029
IF THIS GOES DOWN IN FLAMES,
I WILL HAVE NOTHING

209
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,130
EXCEPT MY LOOKS.

210
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,167
I COULD ALWAYS PIMP MYSELF OUT
TO HOT OLDER LADIES.

211
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,135
I NEED TO REMEMBER THAT.

212
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,004
- MAY, 1817.

213
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,173
A SCRAPPY GROUP
OF FRONTIERSMEN AND WOMEN

214
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,141
ARRIVE AT A HARDSCRABBLE
CHUNK OF LAND

215
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,878
AND CALL IT PAWNEE,
INDIANA.

216
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,179
- WE OWE THEM
A DEBT OF GRATITUDE.

217
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,215
- MM. JUNE, 1817,
THE RICHEST AMONG THEM

218
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,017
TAKE ALL OF THEIR MONEY
FROM THE BANK

219
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,886
AND THEN FLEE UP THE HILL
LIKE COWARDS

220
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,220
TO FORM EAGLETON.

221
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,858
RECOGNIZE ANY OF YOUR ANCESTORS
AMONG THE MEANIES?

222
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,060
- ACTUALLY, LIKE MOST PEOPLE
FROM THE AREA,

223
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,762
I HAVE ANCESTORS
ON BOTH SIDES.

224
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,765
THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS RIVALRY
IS JUST A LITTLE SILLY

225
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,134
AND SELF-DEFEATING.
- YEAH, YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS,

226
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,236
BUT LESLIE WAS ACTUALLY
BORN IN EAGLETON.

227
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,206
- DO NOT BLAME ME
FOR THE SINS OF MY MOTHER.

228
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,175
- LOOK, MS. KNOPE,
I'M REALLY TRYING HERE,

229
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,344
BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF OUR WORKING TOGETHER

230
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,213
IS SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

231
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,181
- OH...RUNNING AWAY SO SOON.
TYPICAL.

232
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,150
YOU KNOW, SAY WHAT YOU WANT
ABOUT PAWNEEANS,

233
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,752
BUT WE NEVER GIVE UP.

234
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,788
- WE HAVE A MURAL CALLED
"THE MANY SURRENDERS OF PAWNEE."

235
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,323
- OH, LOOK WHO'S PAYING
ATTENTION TO ME NOW!

236
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,926
- OKAY. CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
PRIVATELY FOR A MINUTE?

237
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,262
- THE NAME IS SPECIAL AGENT
BERT MACKLIN.

238
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,097
TELL ME WHO YOU ARE,
WHO YOU WORK FOR,

239
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,799
AND DON'T BOTHER TRYING
TO LIE TO ME,

240
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,000
BECAUSE I'M AMAZING.

241
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,669
- [accent]
MY NAME IS JUDY HITLER,

242
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,038
AND I AM THE SPOILED
ONLY DAUGHTER OF ADOLF.

243
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,973
AND I'M GOING TO TELL MY DADDY

244
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,208
YOU WERE MEAN TO ME,
BERT MACKLIN.

245
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,910
HE'S NOT GOING TO
LIKE IT VERY MUCH.

246
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,312
SO UNTIE ME!
- NICE TRY, MISS HITLER,

247
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,281
BUT YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT I WANT.

248
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,784
WHERE'S THE NECKLACE WITH
ALL OF GERMANY'S WAR SECRETS?

249
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,686
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

250
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,621
- I THINK YOU DO!
- I DON'T!

251
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,757
[thud]

252
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,992
- NOW, YOU GIVE ME
THAT WAR-ENDING NECKLACE,

253
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,694
OR I WILL RESORT TO TORTURE.

254
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:56,964
- FINE. I WILL SHOW YOU
WHERE IT IS, DAMN IT.

255
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,999
YOU'RE TOO GOOD, MACKLIN.

256
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,400
- DON'T YOU DO IT, HITLER.

257
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,803
DON'T YOU DARE
FALL IN LOVE WITH ME.

258
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,140
OH, HITLER, YOU SEXY BASTARD.
NO!

259
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,243
- YES!
- MM...MM!

260
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,914
AAH!

261
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:16,850
- I AM JUST FILLED
TO THE BRIM WITH QUESTIONS.

262
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,218
WHY ARE YOU USING
THIS WOOD?

263
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,688
IS IT MORE PLIABLE?
WHAT ARE THESE METAL LATCHES?

264
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,990
ARE THEY COPPER OR BRASS?
IS ONE BETTER?

265
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,858
AND IF SO, WHY?

266
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,661
- IF I TELL YOU, THEN YOU WON'T
HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING.

267
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,029
- [laughs]

268
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,098
ANOTHER IN A LONG LINE
OF LESSONS

269
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,166
FROM THE GREAT RON SWANSON.

270
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,068
MY THERAPIST,
DR. RICHARD NYGARD,

271
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:39,072
SUGGESTED THAT I TRY SOME
NON-EXERCISE-BASED HOBBIES.

272
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,208
SO I'VE BEEN STUDYING
WOODWORKING WITH RON.

273
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,410
I MADE THIS.

274
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,247
BEFORE I STARTED,
IT WAS BIGGER.

275
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:50,684
- HERE. I HAVE DESIGNED
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

276
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,419
WHY DON'T YOU START WORK
ON THAT RIGHT AWAY?

277
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,954
- YES, SIR!

278
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:58,158
- IT'S A FLIGHT OF STAIRS
THAT LEADS TO NOWHERE.

279
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,159
- WERE YOU LISTENING TO HIM

280
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,161
WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
SERVING THE PUBLIC

281
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,130
AND MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES
BETTER?

282
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,232
YOU KNOW WHO
HE SOUNDS LIKE, RIGHT?

283
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,199
- YES. IDI AMIN.

284
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,235
OR LORD VOLDEMORT.
- NO. YOU.

285
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,170
NOW, YOU'VE BEEN
VERY RUDE TO HIM,

286
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,305
AND YOU NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

287
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,241
- HA HA HA.
YOU ARE A LAUGH RIOT, BEN.

288
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,443
I AM NEVER GOING TO APOLOGIZE
TO SOMEONE FROM EAGLETON.

289
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,145
- ALL RIGHT.
SO YOU CAN KISS YOUR PARK

290
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,780
AND FOUR YEARS OF WORK
GOOD-BYE.

291
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,814
UP TO YOU.

292
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,116
COME ON. YOU CAN DO IT.

293
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,417
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- YOU CAN--

294
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,387
YOU CAN DO IT.

295
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,122
MR. ST. JAMES,

296
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,191
THIS HAS BEEN A STRANGE DAY.

297
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,292
BUT WE WOULDN'T
WANT TO LEAVE YOU

298
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,794
WITH THE WRONG IMPRESSION
OF PAWNEE.

299
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,296
- HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN HITLER?

300
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,468
- ANYWAY, WE WOULD LOVE

301
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,937
TO HAVE YOU DESIGN THE PARK,

302
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,338
AND IN THE SPIRIT
OF RECONCILIATION,

303
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,808
LESLIE WOULD LIKE TO
APOLOGIZE.

304
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,309
- I MAY HAVE ALLOWED
MY PREJUDICES,

305
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,747
MY TOTALLY LEGITIMATE
PREJUDICES AGAINST EAGLETON

306
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:56,149
AFFECT MY FEELINGS TOWARDS YOUR
INVOLVEMENT IN THIS PROJECT,

307
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,417
AND SO THEREFORE,

308
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:00,320
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I'M--

309
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,422
I'M...

310
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,992
I'M LESLIE KNOPE.

311
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,393
[laughs]
NO.

312
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,161
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WANT TO SAY. OKAY.

313
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,162
[slapping face]

314
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,231
I'M...

315
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,333
SSS....

316
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,502
MY MOUTH IS KINDA DRY.

317
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:18,071
MY MOUTH IS DRY.
THIS IS CANADA DRY.

318
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,307
DRINK CANADA DRY
IF YOUR MOUTH IS DRY.

319
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,176
THAT'S NOTHING.
WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS

320
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,978
I'M S...

321
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,346
I'M SOR...

322
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,915
I'M SOR--

323
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,917
HE'S A HUMAN BEING.
YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING.

324
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,384
YOU CAN JUST--
JUST SAY--

325
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,253
I'M SOR--

326
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,521
- OH, MY GOD.
- I'M SORRY.

327
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,023
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

328
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:38,058
I'M SORRY THAT I--
I'M SORRY, VERY SORRY,

329
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,827
THAT I WAS RUDE.

330
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,896
IT'S TOO SOON.
- YOU KNOW WHAT,

331
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,198
AS A GESTURE OF GOOD WILL,
I'D LIKE TO WAIVE MY FEE.

332
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,934
I'LL DESIGN THE PARK
PRO BONO.

333
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,435
- THANK YOU.

334
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,270
THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU.
- I'VE BEEN WORKING UP

335
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,372
A LITTLE MODEL OF THE DESIGN.
WHY DON'T I BRING IT OVER,

336
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,241
AND WE CAN ALL
GO THROUGH IT TOGETHER.

337
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,209
- GREAT. AND THEN YOU CAN
COME TO OUR WEDDING.

338
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,811
- HUH?
- WHAT?

339
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,446
- IT'S IN MAY, AND WE HAVEN'T
PLANNED IT YET,

340
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,448
BUT SAVE THE DATE.

341
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,318
- [accent]
I WAS NEVER HERE.

342
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,188
- AH!
- AAH!

343
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,124
- WELL DONE, TEAM.

344
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,993
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE PLACE?

345
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,295
- DO YOU REALLY LIKE
THIS YELLOW PAINT?

346
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,163
I MEAN,
I KNOW IT WAS ON SALE,

347
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,331
BUT IT LOOKS A LOT
LIKE DRIED PHLEGM.

348
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,100
- FOR REAL, TOM.
THIS PLACE IS SAD.

349
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,270
I THINK ONE OF THE MANNEQUINS
TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE.

350
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,504
- I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS WE ALL HAD A GOAL,

351
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,106
AND WE ACHIEVED IT.

352
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:29,042
- SO YOU LIKE THE PLACE?
- OH, NO, IT'S QUITE TERRIBLE.

353
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,377
- THIS IS THE BEST
I CAN DO FOR NOW.

354
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,913
AND I'M $46 UNDER BUDGET.

355
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,347
NOW I HAVE A SMALL TREAT
FOR YOU GUYS

356
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,883
FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK.

357
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,285
PIZZA PARTY!

358
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,153
- ONE SMALL PIZZA
FOR ALL OF US.

359
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,554
WITH NO TOPPINGS.

360
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,223
- CHEESE IS A TOPPING, JERRY.

361
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,458
AND WHY ARE THESE LIGHTS
BLARING, BY THE WAY?

362
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,295
DOES SOMEONE HERE OWN STOCK
IN THE ELECTRIC COMPANY?

363
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:53,200
- IF THERE WERE MORE FOOD
AND FEWER PEOPLE,

364
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,335
THIS WOULD BE A PERFECT PARTY.

365
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,004
- [laughing]
- YOU CAN'T RUN, HITLER.

366
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,972
82ND AIRBORNE
IS EVERYWHERE!

367
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,507
HISTORY CHANNEL.

368
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,042
HO HO HO!

369
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,210
WHAT IS THIS?

370
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,313
A CHILD SPY,
SENT TO STEAL THE NECKLACE?

371
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,648
BERT MACKLIN, FBI!
FREEZE!

372
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,483
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

373
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,419
- YEAH, BAD CALL, BERT.
- OH.

374
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,154
OH, HEY, I'M JUST KIDDING,
BUDDY.

375
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,189
I'M JUST PLAYING AROUND.
MY NAME'S REALLY ANDY DWYER.

376
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,324
I'M A SECURITY GUARD.

377
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,259
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- JOEY.

378
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:22,229
I WAS WITH MY MOM,
AND I GOT LOST.

379
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,430
- OH. WELL, GOSH,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

380
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,665
I'VE GOTTEN LOST HERE
ABOUT 500 TIMES,

381
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,300
AND I WORK HERE.

382
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,302
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO
FIND YOUR MOM, HUH?

383
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,606
SHE'S NOT IN THERE,
I'LL BET.

384
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,442
LET'S TRY THIS WAY.

385
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,676
- HELLO?

386
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,912
MS. KNOPE, MR. WYATT?

387
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,347
WE'RE FROM
WRESTON ST. JAMES' FIRM.

388
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,982
- OH, HEY, COME ON IN.

389
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,350
WHERE'S WRESTON?

390
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,052
- HE'S ON HIS WAY.
HE WANTED US TO GET STARTED.

391
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,188
- AW! OH, WELL.
OKAY, I GUESS GO AHEAD.

392
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:51,258
- WE PRESENT
THE CROWN JEWEL OF PAWNEE

393
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:55,929
CONTAINING THE SIGHTS, SOUNDS,
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

394
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,065
SMELLS THAT DEFINE YOUR CITY.

395
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,166
- THERE ARE SEVERAL
DROOL BUCKETS

396
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,201
FOR YOUR MORE...
SLACK-JAWED CITIZENS.

397
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,536
WE ALSO HAVE FOOD TROUGHS
FULL OF CHEESEBURGERS

398
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,405
AND PUBLIC SHOWERS

399
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,575
WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THOSE
WHO'VE NEVER SHOWERED BEFORE.

400
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,610
- YOU HAVE FIVE SECONDS
TO GET OUT OF HERE...

401
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,280
OR I WILL RIP YOUR THROATS OUT.

402
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,182
- OUT.
NOW.

403
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:19,319
- OH, HEY, MY BACKYARD
IS BIGGER THAN YOUR PARKS.

404
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,321
[both laughing]
- LESLIE, STAY BACK, STAY BACK.

405
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:29,329
- I TOLD YOU THAT EAGLETONIANS
ARE AWFUL, TERRIBLE PEOPLE.

406
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,598
THEY CALL THEIR BOOGERS
PAWNEE CAVIAR.

407
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,333
- I'M ON YOUR SIDE,

408
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,235
AND I'M FURIOUS TOO.

409
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,404
BUT THIS JUST DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE TO ME.

410
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:38,972
I'M GONNA TALK TO WRESTON,

411
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:40,573
AND I'M GONNA GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

412
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,574
- ANY EXCUSE
TO TALK TO WRESTON.

413
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,710
WELL, I AM GONNA THINK
ABOUT A REVENGE PLAN.

414
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,078
I KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

415
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,213
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT
WHERE HE LIVES.

416
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:47,580
WE'RE GONNA DRIVE
TO HIS HOUSE.

417
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,149
WE'RE GONNA SET IT ON FIRE
AND WATCH IT BURN.

418
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,483
- LESLIE, WE CAN'T DO THAT.

419
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,686
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE CAN'T.

420
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,157
- ALL RIGHT, SO...

421
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,992
DOES THIS LOOK FAMILIAR?

422
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,494
- NO, NOT AT ALL.
- I WAS TALKING TO JOEY.

423
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,662
- JOEY!
- MOMMY!

424
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:03,763
- THERE YOU ARE.

425
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:06,399
OH, GOD, I WAS SO WORRIED.

426
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,734
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

427
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,569
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH
I APPRECIATE IT.

428
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,305
- WELL, JUST DOING
MY JOB, MA'AM.

429
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,673
- THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME,
ANDY.

430
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,009
THANK YOU, TOO, MISS HITLER.

431
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,744
- WHAT?
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

432
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:20,713
WOW. YOU MADE THOSE LOSERS
VERY HAPPY.

433
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,315
- OH, NO, I DIDN'T.

434
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,783
BERT MACKLIN DID.
- NO...

435
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,418
- FBI.
- ACTUALLY,

436
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,255
- BERT MACKLIN KINDA MADE
THAT LITTLE BOY CRY.

437
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:31,491
- WELL, HE'S A ROGUE AGENT WHO
REFUSES TO PLAY BY THE RULES.

438
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,726
- SERIOUSLY, I THINK ANDY DWYER
MAKES A BETTER REAL COP

439
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,129
THAN BERT MACKLIN.
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR BERT MACKLIN

440
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,499
TO HANG UP HIS SHADES.

441
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,635
- CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING
TO DRINK?

442
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,771
- ICED TEA, PLEASE.
AND CAN I ASK YOU,

443
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,040
HOW ARE THERE PALM TREES
HERE?

444
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,675
- WELL, EAGLETON LIES
ON TOP OF A HOT SPRING

445
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,777
WHICH CREATES
A MICRO-CLIMATE ZONE.

446
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,546
WE ARE...[chuckles]
TRULY BLESSED.

447
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,050
- GOD, I'M SO SORRY
I'M LATE.

448
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,685
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED,
MAN?

449
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,221
- I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT STUPID PRANK.

450
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,655
IN FACT,
THAT'S WHY I'M LATE.

451
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,257
I WAS FIRING THE TWO PEOPLE
WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE,

452
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,658
AND I WAS ESCORTING THEM
OUT OF THE BUILDING.

453
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,360
- WELL...GOOD!

454
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,129
- FULL DISCLOSURE:
CERTAIN PEOPLE IN THE FIRM

455
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:11,831
WANTED TO PROMOTE THEM,
BUT I INSISTED THEY BE FIRED.

456
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,067
- IF YOU SWEAR TO ME
THAT YOU'RE SERIOUS,

457
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,535
MAYBE WE CAN SALVAGE THIS.

458
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:19,072
- I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO.
BUT WHAT ABOUT LESLIE?

459
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,740
I JUST DOUBT
THAT SHE CAN EVER GET OVER

460
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,142
THE BAD BLOOD
BETWEEN OUR TOWNS.

461
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,376
- I THINK YOU'RE WRONG.

462
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,345
LESLIE
IS A VERY FORGIVING PERSON.

463
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,713
- REVENGE!
HA HA HA1

464
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,483
THIS IS FOR PAWNEE,
YOU BUTT-FACED POMPOUS JERK!

465
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,252
WHOO!

466
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,453
I LOVE YOU, BEN.

467
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:34,554
PAWNEE FOREVER!

468
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,690
YOU WANT A STUPID TIE?
I'LL GIVE YOU A STUPID TIE.

469
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,527
HA HA!
WRESTON, SUCK IT.

470
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,262
NOW WE'RE EVEN.
- LESLIE.

471
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,796
- HUH?
- HE DIDN'T DO IT,

472
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,865
AND HE FIRED THE PEOPLE
WHO DID.

473
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:50,737
[cans clatter on ground]

474
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,539
[running footsteps]

475
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,807
- ATTENTION, PLEASE.

476
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,376
I'VE BEEN GOING OVER
THE BOOKS,

477
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,711
AND I'M MISSING $9.

478
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,148
NOW, I'M NOT ANGRY
AT WHOEVER TOOK IT.

479
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,382
JUST COME FORWARD.

480
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,883
YOU'LL BE SERVED
WITH A LAWSUIT,

481
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,319
AND WE WILL MOVE ON
WITH OUR LIVES.

482
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,322
- HEY, BUDDY, LET'S GO GET
SOME BREAKFAST, OKAY?

483
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,258
- FINE. IT WAS YOUR IDEA,
SO YOU'RE PAYING.

484
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,160
YOU'RE DRIVING.
I'M NOT CHIPPING IN FOR GAS.

485
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,695
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

486
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,264
- I'LL HAVE
THE PANCAKE BREAKFAST.

487
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,798
OH, LET ME ALSO GET
12 EGGS, UNCOOKED,

488
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,700
AND SOME TOAST.

489
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,636
20 SLICES, UNTOASTED,
IN A ROW IN A BAG.

490
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,772
- YOU WANT A CARTON OF EGGS
AND A LOAF OF BREAD.

491
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,807
- YEAH, JUST THE PANCAKE
BREAKFAST IS FINE.

492
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,443
- DON'T OFFER TO PAY
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE CHEAP.

493
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,712
- LISTEN, MAN, I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES

494
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,381
OF ENTERTAINMENT 720,
AND THAT'S GREAT,

495
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,416
BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A LITTLE BIT OF THE OLD TOM

496
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,717
TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS WORK.

497
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,652
- NO. THAT TOM RUINED
EVERYTHING.

498
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,188
- YES, HE DID,

499
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:43,890
AND THAT TOM MADE YOU
A HORRIBLE BOYFRIEND

500
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,693
AND A TERRIBLE EMPLOYEE
AND DROVE YOU TO BANKRUPTCY.

501
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,661
- ARE WE NEARING THE POINT?

502
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,330
- BUT YOUR SWAGGER
AND YOUR SHOWMANSHIP

503
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,798
AND YOUR CONFIDENCE
IS PART OF YOU,

504
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,700
AND IN SMALL DOSES,
IT CAN HELP.

505
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,668
YOU CAN'T HAVE RENT-A-SWAG
WITHOUT THE SWAG.

506
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,938
- I BARELY HAVE ENOUGH CASH
TO GET EVERYTHING SET UP.

507
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,607
- I KNOW.
TAKE THIS.

508
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,676
WE ALL CHIPPED IN.
USE IT TO SPRUCE UP THE STORE.

509
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,278
AND IN RETURN YOU CAN GIVE US

510
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,779
LIKE ONE SHARE OF STOCK
IN THE COMPANY.

511
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,716
- LIKE A MINI PUBLIC OFFERING.

512
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,684
"SMORT", ANN.
SMORT.

513
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:12,952
THIS IS A CAUSE
FOR CELEBRATION.

514
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,922
WAITER! EIGHT STRIPS
OF BACON, UNCOOKED,

515
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,758
IN A SEALED PACKAGE.

516
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,628
- I CALL IT
THE PAWNEE COMMONS,

517
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,630
A CELEBRATION OF PAWNEE'S
HISTORY AND PEOPLE.

518
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,266
- A WAMAPOKE-THEMED
PLAYGROUND...

519
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,701
GOOD TRUCKS
FROM LOCAL RESTAURANTS,

520
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,370
LI'L SEBASTIAN FOUNTAIN.

521
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,439
I MEAN, IT'S PERFECT.
- THANK YOU.

522
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,706
- I CAN'T SEE MYSELF
FIGHTING YOU

523
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,209
ON MORE THAN
60% OF THESE IDEAS.

524
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,445
- I'D EXPECT NO LESS.
I'M JUST GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

525
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,312
I'VE NEVER MET TWO PEOPLE

526
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,648
MORE PASSIONATE
ABOUT THEIR HOMETOWN.

527
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,450
- OH, I'M ACTUALLY FROM
MINNESOTA.

528
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,917
- WHY DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT PAWNEE?

529
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,854
- WELL, I'M IN LOVE
WITH A WOMAN FROM HERE.

530
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:51,358
A STRANGE, PASSIONATE,
GOOFBALL OF A WOMAN.

531
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,860
- [giggles]
ME. HE'S IN LOVE WITH ME.

532
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,566
- I'M SORRY TO SEE YOU GO,
MACKLIN.

533
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,901
YOU DIDN'T ALWAYS
PLAY BY THE RULES,

534
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,337
BUT DAMN IT,
YOU WERE A HELL OF AN AGENT.

535
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,673
- TODAY I SAY GOOD-BYE TO
THE ONLY LIFE I'VE EVER KNOWN.

536
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:09,376
- WELL, SOME OF THE BOYS
CHIPPED IN

537
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,745
AND WE GOT YOU...THIS.

538
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:16,349
IT ISN'T MUCH, BUT IT'S
SOMETHING TO REMEMBER US BY.

539
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:21,988
- 40 YEARS UNDERCOVER.
I NEVER EVEN MET MY FAMILY.

540
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,923
- WHAT?
- AND THIS IS ALL I HAVE

541
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:26,359
TO SHOW FOR IT?

542
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,827
TOTALLY WORTH IT.

543
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,763
- IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE
SERVING WITH YOU, SON.

544
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,665
- IF YOU EVER NEED ME,
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME--

545
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,835
IN BED NEXT TO YOU,
PROBABLY HAVING SEX WITH YOU.

546
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,838

547
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:39,839

553
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,986
I USED THE MONEY
YOU GUYS GAVE ME

554
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,488
TO ADD A LITTLE FLAIR,

555
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:57,424
AND I TOOK EVERYTHING
I OWN IN MY HOUSE

556
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:58,658
AND BROUGHT IT HERE,
EXCEPT FOR MY BED.

557
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,293
I BASICALLY LIVE HERE NOW.

558
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,694
- I HATE ALL OF THIS,

559
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,963
WHICH PROBABLY MEANS
IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR BUSINESS.

560
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:08,034

IT'S FOR DISPLAYING SHOES!

561
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:10,670
-YES. THAT WAS ALWAYS
THE PLAN.

00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,339
- ALL RIGHT,
