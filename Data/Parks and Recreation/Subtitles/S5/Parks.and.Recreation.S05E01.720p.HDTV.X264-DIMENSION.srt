1
00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:02,439
Washington, D.C.

2
00:00:02,992 --> 00:00:04,939
Take a deep breath, Andy.

3
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:08,143
I mean, you can practically
smell the bills becoming laws.

4
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:09,178
Yeah.

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,413
You can taste the sweet sugar
of bureaucracy at work.

6
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:13,848
That building
looks like a boob.

7
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,450
- Yeah, well, it's not.
- Oh, yeah, I know.

8
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,485
- It's the White House.
- No. It's the Capitol.

9
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:19,788
My amazing lover, Ben Wyatt,
is here

10
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:21,523
working on
a congressional campaign.

11
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,325
And he took April with him
as his intern.

12
00:00:24,393 --> 00:00:26,528
I'm here to visit,
but I am also here to work,

13
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:28,163
because I have
a very important meeting

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,165
where I am going to try to get
federal funding

15
00:00:30,232 --> 00:00:32,233
so we can clean up
the Pawnee river.

16
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:33,702
It's a bit of a fixer-upper.

17
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:36,604
Romantic reunions,
government meetings,

18
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:38,339
self-guided museum tours--

19
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:41,242
I mean, am I living the dream?
I don't know.

20
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,178
Did I also just walk
past a food truck

21
00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:46,214
and buy myself a waffle sundae?
Yes.

22
00:00:46,282 --> 00:00:47,515
Now take out your guidebook.

23
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,616
Oh, I didn't bring
a guidebook.

24
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:49,851
- Oh, I brought you one.
- You did?

25
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:51,319
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

26
00:00:51,387 --> 00:00:53,588
Now throw it away, 'cause
Leslie Knope is your guidebook.

27
00:00:53,656 --> 00:00:55,390
I didn't--

28
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,559
I didn't mean literally.
There were some notes in it.

29
00:00:57,626 --> 00:01:00,028
Okay, grab the book,
and let's hit the National Mall.

30
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:01,262
There's a mall?
That's awesome.

31
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,564
I need to get some flip-flops.

32
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:10,234
<font color="#ff8c00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>
<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

33
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:24,986
Why are we having
a conference-room meeting?

34
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:26,421
Leslie's gone.

35
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,923
Ron has taken initiative,
and he is leading the meeting.

36
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,260
He's not joking.

37
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:34,796
I wanted to let you all know
that I will be throwing

38
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:38,199
the annual Parks Department
employee-appreciation barbecue.

39
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:40,335
You're going to throw
the Leslie Knope

40
00:01:40,402 --> 00:01:43,805
Employment Enjoyment Summerslam
Grill Jam Fun-splosion?

41
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:45,306
That's right.

42
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:47,175
You are gonna oversee
the Popsicle-eating contest,

43
00:01:47,243 --> 00:01:48,343
the slip'n slide-a-thon,

44
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,712
the watermelon carving,
the gazpacho-off,

45
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,181
and star in a one-woman show

46
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:54,883
about parks rules
and regulations?

47
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,451
"Parks and Dolls."

48
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,622
♪ I got your park right here,
its name is Ramsett Park. ♪

49
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,492
♪ and its gates are open
from dawn till dark. ♪

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,028
I am not doing any of that,
which is the point.

51
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:10,298
Every summer
Leslie throws a barbecue

52
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:12,000
to thank the Parks
and Maintenance staff.

53
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:14,169
It's horrifying.

54
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:15,970
Barbecues should be
about one thing--

55
00:02:16,038 --> 00:02:18,006
good, shared meat.

56
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:20,475
There will be
no froofy desserts.

57
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:22,977
There will be
no giant-soap-bubble guns.

58
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,413
There will be
no adult men in costumes.

59
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:27,148
And most of all,

60
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:30,151
there will be
no bleeping vegetables.

61
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,520
Well, Ron, can we at least
have corn on the cob?

62
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:36,691
No.

63
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:38,459
"In this temple,

64
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:41,830
"As in the hearts of the people
for whom he saved the Union,

65
00:02:41,897 --> 00:02:44,699
the memory of Abraham Lincoln
is enshrined forever."

66
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,701
Andy, what are you doing?

67
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,504
Have you ever seen any
of the <i>National Treasure</i> movies?

68
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:51,406
Everything in this city
is a clue.

69
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:52,907
Nothing in that movie
is accurate.

70
00:02:52,975 --> 00:02:54,609
Aha! A clue!

71
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,678
Check it out.

72
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:58,012
I think that's just gum.

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,647
How do I know this isn't
a treasure map

74
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:00,849
just waiting to be unfurled?

75
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,585
- Because it's gum.
- That's gum.

76
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:04,786
Yeah.

77
00:03:04,854 --> 00:03:06,120
So you can see
that the color changes

78
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:08,456
about 1/3 of the way up,
and it's when construction

79
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:09,557
was actually halted
on the monu--

80
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,125
Leslie, this is
a really cool penis,

81
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:12,694
but Ben and April
are meeting us

82
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:14,229
at the Smithsonian
in 10 minutes.

83
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:17,298
Let's talk on the way.
1776, a nation was born.

84
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:18,600
Which nation?

85
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,803
I offered Ron
a job last month,

86
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:22,971
and he turned me down.

87
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:25,740
And it literally
broke my heart.

88
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:29,844
But now I see that
this is truly where he belongs.

89
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:31,646
Way to be, Ron!

90
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:35,483
You're really
getting it done, man!

91
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:36,784
He can't hear me.

92
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:38,887
Okay, let's begin
the barbecue.

93
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:40,788
Oh, hey, little guy.

94
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:43,424
What are you doing?
Oh, no.

95
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:44,959
Everyone, meet your meat.

96
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:47,795
No!

97
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:49,097
Why are you doing this to us?

98
00:03:49,164 --> 00:03:50,465
Well, in my opinion,
not enough people

99
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:51,900
have looked their dinner
in the eyes

100
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:54,369
and considered
the circle of life.

101
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:56,838
This is your dinner.
His name is Tom.

102
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,107
Burn.

103
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:00,208
Seriously?

104
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:01,976
I understand
that it's hilarious,

105
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:03,945
but that is
his given, Christian name.

106
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:06,414
Tom is very smart
and incredibly loyal.

107
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:08,082
He's basically a dog.

108
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,451
A dog we're going to cook,
chew, and swallow.

109
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:12,353
Dude, there's kids
around here.

110
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:13,354
Good point.

111
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:14,722
Which one of you youngsters

112
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,491
wants to help me drain the blood
from this animal?

113
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:18,860
If you do a good job,
I'll give you the bladder.

114
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:21,129
You can blow it up
for a fun play ball.

115
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:22,497
Hey, Ron.

116
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:24,699
You're not going to slaughter
that pig here, are you?

117
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:27,802
Not to worry.
I have a permit.

118
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,638
This just says,
"I can do what I want."

119
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:33,141
I am the director
of the Parks Department,

120
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,276
and this is a park.

121
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:36,778
It's not a Parks thing.

122
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:39,447
It's against, like, three laws
and a dozen health codes.

123
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,151
Fine.

124
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:44,886
Barbecue is postponed

125
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:47,322
until I can go pick up some meat
from the Food 'n' Stuff.

126
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:49,724
Let's go, Tom.

127
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,025
No, pig Tom.

128
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:57,465
So I want to see
the history of the girl scouts

129
00:04:57,533 --> 00:05:00,368
and then Lincoln's pocket watch
and the First Ladies exhibit

130
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:03,338
and everything--
I want to see everything.

131
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:04,939
Andy, get down from there.

132
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:06,240
Hey, Leslie. Is this the train
from <i>Back to the Future III?</i>

133
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:08,476
- Get down from there.
- I think it is.

134
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:09,577
Hey, buddy.

135
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:12,080
Come on down from there
for me, please.

136
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:13,514
Sir, you protect
our nation's history,

137
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:14,549
and you're a hero.

138
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,317
Yeah,
a hero with something to hide,

139
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:17,986
like probably a treasure map.

140
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:20,555
Oh, hey.
It's so good to see you.

141
00:05:20,622 --> 00:05:22,657
It's so great to see you too.

142
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:24,058
Yeah.

143
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:26,427
Yikes.

144
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:28,997
Okay, uh, guys,
let's motor.

145
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:30,665
Guys. Guys.

146
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,667
Let's go get some astronaut
ice cream or something.

147
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:34,635
We were thinking
about maybe just--

148
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:36,771
uh, we--
maybe we were gonna go back to--

149
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,740
We're gonna have sex.

150
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:40,008
Okay.
You look great, April.

151
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:41,442
Sorry, hon.
I actually have to go too.

152
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,711
Oh, really? I thought maybe
we could sightsee together.

153
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:45,413
I know.
I have, like, 1,000 meetings.

154
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:47,315
But I just wanted to come
wish you luck

155
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:48,416
before your presentation.

156
00:05:48,484 --> 00:05:49,984
Oh, but you know
what you should see

157
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:51,386
while you're here
is George Washington's fare--

158
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:52,787
Farewell address candle stand.

159
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:54,555
That was the first thing
I was going to see.

160
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:56,791
God, I love you so much.

161
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:59,027
Come to my office
as soon as you're done, okay?

162
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:00,194
Okay.

163
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:02,263
And it was nice
to see you again.

164
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,631
Are you talking to my butt?

165
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,767
- Yes.
- Okay.

166
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:09,971
Where is Swanson?

167
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,572
Man, I'm hungry.
My legs are tired.

168
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,642
It feels like
I just exercised.

169
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,210
Just sit on the ground.

170
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:17,612
No, Jerry.

171
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:19,113
It's dirty, and I'm wearing
my summer linens.

172
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:20,248
God, you're such a baby.

173
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:21,716
Look, I brought a picnic blanket
from your house.

174
00:06:21,784 --> 00:06:23,918
That's not a picnic blanket.

175
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:26,454
That's a Merino wool throw
for my Eames chair!

176
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:28,122
Uh-oh.
Do I sense trouble

177
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,124
in the Haverford-Perkins
household?

178
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:31,426
No such luck, Donna.

179
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:34,829
Ann and Tom, aka Haverkins,
are stronger than ever.

180
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:36,798
Everyone said it wouldn't last.

181
00:06:36,865 --> 00:06:38,499
And it didn't.

182
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,968
Shocking that our drunken plan
to move in together

183
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:42,336
wasn't a success.

184
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:44,739
- Let's move in together.
- Totally.

185
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:46,841
No take-backs when we
sober up, though, partner.

186
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:49,610
No take-backs, partner.

187
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:52,380
After the first day, we realized
we had made a huge mistake.

188
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:53,648
Huge.

189
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:56,451
However, everyone was being
so smug about it,

190
00:06:56,518 --> 00:06:57,885
saying there's no way
it would last,

191
00:06:57,953 --> 00:07:00,054
so we're pretending
to still be together.

192
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:02,423
That way, no one gets
the satisfaction of being right,

193
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:04,092
even though they are,
but still.

194
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:06,461
More importantly,
I bet Donna $1,000

195
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:08,029
that we'd be together
for another month.

196
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:09,797
I can't stress this enough.

197
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:12,100
If she finds out
that we broke up,

198
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,135
I'll go bankrupt.

199
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:17,605
Oh, my God.
Food. Food.

200
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:18,706
Yes, I am returned.

201
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:20,708
No.
Not so fast, Shirley.

202
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:23,144
I just have to thaw the meat,
season it, and grill it up.

203
00:07:23,212 --> 00:07:24,378
So it's going to be a few hours.

204
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:26,180
No, Ron.

205
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:28,983
My tummy's rumbling.
It's scary.

206
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:30,384
Tommy's got the tum-rums.

207
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:32,386
Ron, Chris Traeger
feelings update--

208
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:36,457
I'm now feeling that your guests
are getting a little antsy.

209
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:39,060
Fine. I'll skip a few steps
and speed things up.

210
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:40,194
There you go.

211
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:41,529
Is there at least
something to drink?

212
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:43,131
There's beer in the cooler.

213
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:44,499
What about for the children?

214
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,400
You can get water
from that water fountain

215
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:47,835
and use it
to water down the beer.

216
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:49,804
Why don't you just
give the kids water?

217
00:07:49,872 --> 00:07:50,805
I suppose you could do that.

218
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:52,406
Now, would everyone
please back off

219
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:54,876
and just let me cook in peace?

220
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:56,377
These people are soft.

221
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:57,979
They're grill virgins.

222
00:07:58,046 --> 00:08:00,348
But by the time
this day is over,

223
00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:02,183
they'll have been
taken by the grill

224
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:04,852
and delicately and tenderly
shown the ways

225
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,421
of flavorful meat love.

226
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,090
Mmm...

227
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:11,526
The first time
is so beautiful.

228
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,162
Ben and I are a power couple,

229
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:16,097
like the Roosevelts
or the Clintons.

230
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:17,665
I've got a big meeting here.

231
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:20,201
Ben is off running
a congressional campaign.

232
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,503
I mean, the only way
we could be more awesome

233
00:08:22,571 --> 00:08:24,839
is if we had our own
signature dance move.

234
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:26,007
Oh, wait.
We do.

235
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:29,277
Three, four.

236
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:35,883
I'm Leslie Knope.
I have a 3:00 with Mr. Jepson.

237
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:37,118
What's this in reference to?

238
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:38,819
I'm here to present
my application

239
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:40,721
for the Federal Riverbed
Preservation Grant.

240
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,024
Oh. Most people just mail
their applications in.

241
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:44,959
I'm not most people.

242
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:47,061
Mr. Jepson actually had
to step out for the day.

243
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:51,732
You can just add your proposal
to that pile there.

244
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

245
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:55,369
I was told I would have
a face-to-face meeting with him

246
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:57,772
so I could make my case
for my town.

247
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,073
Does he have office hours?

248
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:00,408
He's unavailable
for the rest of the week.

249
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:02,043
But you can just add
the proposal.

250
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,079
- He'll get to it.
- Oh...

251
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,914
Okay.

252
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:11,819
It's kind of
a special application.

253
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:14,855
Uh, you know,
there's a-a CD inside

254
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:18,259
that, uh, plays the sound
of a babbling river,

255
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:21,495
and I was going to play that
while I gave my presentation.

256
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:23,564
I was also going to show a DVD

257
00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:26,334
that had some images
of frolicking river otters.

258
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,336
You know what?
I-I'll make sure he reads it.

259
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:29,937
What city is it for?

260
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:31,405
Pawnee.

261
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:34,108
Is that Pawnee, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa,

262
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:36,010
Kansas, Missouri,
Nebraska, Oklahoma,

263
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:37,745
or Texas?

264
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:39,714
- Indiana.
- Okay.

265
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,623
This is amazing.

266
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,623
Look at this.

267
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:46,692
This whole place is your office.

268
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,694
Nope.
This is my office.

269
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,396
Ben, you're fired.
It's my office now.

270
00:09:50,463 --> 00:09:51,864
Boom.
You heard the boss.

271
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:52,965
Scram, Wyatt.

272
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,067
- Hey.
- Hey. How'd it go?

273
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:56,735
Um, I think okay.

274
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:58,337
- Yeah?
- Okay, I think.

275
00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:00,339
Well, I have a surprise
for you.

276
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:04,376
Uh, there's a swanky D.C.
Cocktail party at the Hay-Adams,

277
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:06,712
and I got us all on the list.

278
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,082
Wow, look at you.
You're a big shot.

279
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,051
Hey, uh, Benjamin,
how fancy is this party tonight?

280
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:15,921
I mean, is this, like, a shorts
or a pants kind of gala?

281
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:18,190
- Pants.
- Great.

282
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:19,825
Could we just real quick stop
at the nearest place

283
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:21,026
that has free pants?

284
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:26,398
I know that Ron
doesn't want us to eat anything

285
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:28,200
before the meat,
but I smuggled in some candy.

286
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:29,568
Oh, thank God.
I'm starving.

287
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:31,503
Raisins?

288
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:33,038
It's nature's candy.

289
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:34,573
Now, they're basically grapes.

290
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,875
So remember to pace yourself.

291
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:40,379
I can't even follow
my own advice.

292
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:42,381
It's too delicious.

293
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:44,950
Oh, my God.

294
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:46,552
Did you put glitter
in the laundry detergent?

295
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:48,053
Oh, yeah.

296
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,788
I'm experimenting with some
new entrepreneurial ideas.

297
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,790
That one's called "Sparkle Suds."

298
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:52,958
Dress loud.

299
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:54,860
Will you stop putting
glitter in everything?

300
00:10:54,928 --> 00:10:56,261
This morning
you put glitter in the butter.

301
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:58,163
"Disco Dairy."
Spread the party.

302
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:00,632
No, that's not a good idea.
That's terrible.

303
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,402
Well, the target demographic
isn't angry, middle-aged nurses.

304
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,170
- Oh--shh, stop it--hey.
- Wait--

305
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:06,271
Hey.

306
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:07,673
I'm going to get in line
for some food.

307
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:08,841
Y'all want anything?

308
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:10,542
- We're good. We're really good.
- Nope.

309
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,977
Just spending a little time
with my baby girl.

310
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:13,579
Ew.

311
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:15,514
Get off me.

312
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,718
There's so much free food
at this party, honey.

313
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:23,422
I love politics.
Look, I made a shrimp claw.

314
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,690
I'm really proud
of you, babe.

315
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:26,291
Now put your used plate
in my purse.

316
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:27,826
I almost have a complete set.

317
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:29,962
Really? Oh, my God.
You're so smart.

318
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,331
They say it will pass,
but we'll only get $400 million

319
00:11:32,398 --> 00:11:33,732
instead of $900 million.

320
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,237
Kate works at the Pentagon
and Lacey works for Eric Cantor.

321
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:39,605
What do you do, Leslie?

322
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:41,874
I was just recently elected.
I'm a councilwoman.

323
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:43,976
Local government
is so important.

324
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:45,878
My grandma's on the city council
in her town.

325
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:47,513
Gives her a reason
to leave the house.

326
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,881
Oh.

327
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:50,616
Where did you say
you were from?

328
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:52,151
It's called Pawnee.

329
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:53,285
Pawnee, Missouri?

330
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:55,654
Oh, my--
that is so random.

331
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:57,990
I've been there--
totally cute.

332
00:11:58,057 --> 00:11:59,091
Pawnee, Indiana.

333
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,627
Pawnee, Missouri,
is a total craphole.

334
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:04,763
Ben and I both did
some amazing things today.

335
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:06,832
He scored a victory
for the congressional campaign

336
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,000
he's working on.

337
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:11,203
And I was mistaken
for Beverly D'Angelo

338
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:12,905
by a Japanese tourist.

339
00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:17,609
So, pretty big day
for both of us.

340
00:12:17,677 --> 00:12:20,813
Ron, can I have a burger?
I'm hungry.

341
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,548
For the last time,
no burgers yet.

342
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,550
I've got ribs,
and I've got beef cheek.

343
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:27,352
Ron, where are
my vegan soy patties?

344
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,121
Oh, I gave them to the kids.
They love them.

345
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:31,356
They're skipping them
across the pond.

346
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:32,691
Donna, I got to go
to the boys' room.

347
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,693
- Can I have a ride in your car?
- Absolutely not.

348
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:37,830
This barbecue stinks.
I'm saying it. It stinks.

349
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:39,097
Do you have any plates
or anything?

350
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:40,566
I mean, how are we supposed
to eat these rumps?

351
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,067
Ron, if no one takes me
to the bathroom,

352
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:44,236
I'm just going to have
to go in the trees.

353
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:46,371
All right.
Forget it.

354
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:49,074
You have ruined
a perfectly good barbecue

355
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:52,911
with your demands and chatter.

356
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:54,813
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

357
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:08,727
Does anybody feel
like they can't breathe?

358
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:11,063
- I think I need some fresh air.
- We're outside.

359
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,364
God, these women--

360
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:15,067
they're so smart
and accomplished and pretty.

361
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:16,835
And they're tall.

362
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:18,237
Why are they all so tall?

363
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:20,472
It's like C-Span
and Neiman Marcus had kids

364
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:21,440
or something.

365
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:23,508
Hey, so there's a couple more
people I want you to meet.

366
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:26,078
Great. I can't wait to meet,
like, five more tall women.

367
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:28,213
Excuse me, Senators?

368
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:30,015
Ben Wyatt, from
Congressman Murray's campaign.

369
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,884
Ben, I remember you
from the Kennedy Center.

370
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:33,018
- That's right.
- Yeah.

371
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:34,887
I wanted to introduce
my friend Leslie Knope--

372
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:37,589
Senators Barbara Boxer
and Olympia Snow.

373
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:39,524
- A pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do?

374
00:13:39,592 --> 00:13:40,792
So, Leslie, what do you do?

375
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,695
I am a city councilwoman
from Pawnee, Indiana.

376
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:45,264
But you've probably
never heard of us.

377
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:46,531
We're small and unimportant.

378
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:49,067
- I'm sure that's not true.
- But it is.

379
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:50,802
We've got tons of problems.

380
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,839
We're overrun with raccoons
and obese toddlers.

381
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:55,107
Anyway,
I'm probably boring you.

382
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:58,510
I just wanted to say
that you are my role models,

383
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:01,747
and, uh, you are
incredibly amazing women,

384
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:03,015
and it is an honor to meet you,

385
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:05,150
and I really respect
your grace under pressure,

386
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:07,920
and thank you for your time.

387
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:12,291
Excuse me, Senators.

388
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:17,496
Uh, Leslie?

389
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:18,497
Hello?

390
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:21,166
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

391
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:22,434
I'm just tired, okay?

392
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:24,736
I saw 24 historical sights
in a day,

393
00:14:24,804 --> 00:14:27,539
and it's 120 degrees out
with 200% humidity,

394
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:29,074
'cause this is
a stupid swamp town.

395
00:14:29,142 --> 00:14:30,943
Okay, that would make
anyone cranky.

396
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,611
- I'm not cranky.
- Okay.

397
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,614
I thought you'd enjoy meeting
numbers 4 and 26

398
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:37,416
on Leslie's list
of amazing women.

399
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:39,751
I do. I did.

400
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:41,687
You're the most amazing
boyfriend ever.

401
00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:43,355
And if you don't get
out of here soon,

402
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:45,123
I'm going to punch you
in the face.

403
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:48,827
Journal needs a quote
for the profile.

404
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:51,096
It's fine.
Just go.

405
00:14:51,164 --> 00:14:54,967
I'll see you
at your apartment later.

406
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:57,069
This is Ben Wyatt.

407
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:02,174
Excuse me.
I just need to get my coat here.

408
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:04,643
Could you give me
a minute here, please?

409
00:15:04,711 --> 00:15:06,044
Are you--
are you okay?

410
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:07,245
Can I get you anything?

411
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:08,613
I-I would like you
to just leave

412
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:10,282
and give me
a little privacy here, please.

413
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,483
All right.

414
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:14,586
I'm sorry.
I hope everything's okay.

415
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:18,924
Nosy people have no respect
for personal space.

416
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,039
Ann... what the hell?

417
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,039
I put glitter in all
your moisturizers and lotions.

418
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:31,475
I'm calling it
"Sparkle Skin", by Annie.

419
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:33,844
Twinkle, twinkle,
big star.

420
00:15:33,912 --> 00:15:35,546
Ann!
That is an amazing idea,

421
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:37,481
and I will buy it from you,
but never do that again.

422
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:39,249
That was really
expensive moisturizer.

423
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:41,351
Yeah, well,
you ruined all of my clothes.

424
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,821
Well, then, I did you
a huge favor, 'cause they stink.

425
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:45,823
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

426
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,858
Oh, hello, lovers.

427
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:49,493
- Oh.
- Tom!

428
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:51,995
You're amazing!
Kiss me more!

429
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,397
- Uh-huh.
- All right. Enough of this.

430
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:55,733
Y'all broke up a long time ago,
didn't you?

431
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,768
No. We're stronger
than ever, so...

432
00:15:57,836 --> 00:15:59,103
It's all right.

433
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,437
I'ma let y'all have this one.

434
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:02,005
As someone who has lied a lot

435
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:05,275
about various aspects
of a myriad of relationships,

436
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:07,277
I respect the effort
you've gone to.

437
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:08,712
Let's call off the bet.

438
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,214
Thanks, Donna.

439
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:11,515
No problem.

440
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,084
- I guess that's it.
- Yep.

441
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:15,853
The end of a relationship.

442
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,489
And the beginning
of a partnership.

443
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:19,623
Let's talk "Sparkle Skin."

444
00:16:19,691 --> 00:16:20,758
Do we know anyone

445
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:22,426
in product development
over at Sephora?

446
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:24,061
Good-bye, Tom.

447
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,496
Here's a picture
of me and April

448
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:26,864
making out in her apartment.

449
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:28,132
- Oh.
- Here's a picture of us

450
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,801
making out in Ben's office.

451
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:33,237
This is a picture--
oh, this is us making out--

452
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,471
I don't know where that is,

453
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:35,973
but you can tell
that she's sucking on my lip.

454
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:38,775
Traveling.

455
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:40,477
Making out--
are you okay, boss?

456
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:42,279
No.
Not really.

457
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:44,148
I know I should be focusing
on this river cleanup,

458
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:46,784
but all I keep thinking about
is Ben laughing in a helicopter

459
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:48,218
with Hot Rebecca.

460
00:16:48,286 --> 00:16:50,120
Who's Hot Rebecca?

461
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:52,923
She's just this
jealousy amalgam I created.

462
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:56,727
I combined all
of the giant, dark-haired,

463
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:59,296
smartphone power goddesses
into one woman

464
00:16:59,364 --> 00:17:00,798
called Hot Rebecca.

465
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:03,000
- Ah.
- I mean, Ben's life is filled

466
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,968
with senators and briefings
and Super PACs.

467
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:07,838
I can't even get a meeting
with some bureaucrat.

468
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:10,440
I don't even know
what a bureaucrat is.

469
00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:13,677
Everything's going to be fine
with you and Ben,

470
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:17,815
because if I know Ben,
he, too, is an amalgam.

471
00:17:17,882 --> 00:17:19,183
- No.
- Yeah.

472
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,519
Point is, you're better
than Hot Rebecca.

473
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:23,687
You're kickass Leslie.

474
00:17:23,755 --> 00:17:27,491
Long-distance relationships
are never easy,

475
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,426
but you never, ever
give up on stuff.

476
00:17:29,494 --> 00:17:31,361
Thanks.

477
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:33,530
- That's what makes you...
- Nope.

478
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:36,166
An amalgam.
Nailed it.

479
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:40,204
Ron, a word?

480
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:42,639
Are you aware of what's going on
out in your department?

481
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:43,640
I am.

482
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,875
My department is pouting

483
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:46,810
because I didn't put on
a puppet show

484
00:17:46,878 --> 00:17:49,646
based on the funniest
email chain of the year.

485
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:50,914
I would have liked
to have seen that show.

486
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:52,316
My nomination was

487
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,819
Jerry accidentally forwards
his bank statement to everyone.

488
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:57,988
Classic...

489
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,356
And depressing.

490
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:01,258
The point of a barbecue
is not to do

491
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:04,962
hokey, office joke theater.
The point is--

492
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:07,865
The point of the barbecue
was to thank the department.

493
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:10,467
It was an employee-appreciation
barbecue.

494
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:13,103
Ron, I gave you the chance

495
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:15,439
to become assistant
city manager.

496
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:18,308
And you chose to stay here,
which is fine.

497
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:20,611
But if you're going
to lead the department,

498
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:23,180
you occasionally
have to lead the department.

499
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:26,884
And I say that as one
of your closest colleagues

500
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:29,419
and dearest friends...

501
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:31,054
But also as your boss.

502
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,627
I went to our nation's capital
this weekend

503
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:38,495
in order to apply
for a federal grant

504
00:18:38,563 --> 00:18:40,664
to clean up our city's river.

505
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:43,567
But things move pretty slow
in Washington,

506
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:44,935
and I'm not going
to wait around.

507
00:18:45,003 --> 00:18:47,437
Now, I was recently reminded
by someone

508
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:51,909
that I'm not the type of person
to shy away from hard work.

509
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:53,911
What?
Did I--

510
00:18:54,478 --> 00:18:55,679
Do you need something
from me right now?

511
00:18:55,747 --> 00:18:57,080
No, no, no.
Never mind.

512
00:18:57,148 --> 00:19:00,951
Point is, I'm going to clean up
this river by myself.

513
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:03,186
Every Saturday
from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.,

514
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:04,187
I will be here.

515
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:06,123
Those are my office hours.

516
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,758
If you want to come
and talk to me

517
00:19:07,825 --> 00:19:09,860
or ask me questions
or raise an issue,

518
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:11,295
this is where I'll be.

519
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:12,629
Let's get to work, Pawnee.

520
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:15,265
Oh, my God.

521
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,067
The smell is so much worse
when you get up close.

522
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,569
Yeah.
Oh, look, a handgun.

523
00:19:19,637 --> 00:19:20,570
I call it.

524
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:22,472
- Holy--
- Whoa!

525
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,909
Everyone, get in here now!

526
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:30,781
Your work is appreciated.

527
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:31,815
Eat some corn.

528
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:33,817
- Wow. Thank you, Ron.
- Thanks, boss.

529
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:35,452
- Thanks, Ron.
- Thanks, Ron.

530
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,087
Also, here's Tom.

531
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,622
Aah!

532
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:42,326
It actually smells
really delicious.

533
00:19:42,393 --> 00:19:43,593
It really does.

534
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:45,329
Give me some of Tommy's ribs.

535
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:47,631
- Oh, heck, yeah.
- Sorry, Tom.

536
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:49,166
Oh, my God.
That's good.

537
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,301
I mean, if I'd known
it didn't go well

538
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:53,003
with the guy from Interior, I--

539
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:54,838
No, no, no.
You did nothing wrong.

540
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:56,306
I'm so happy for you

541
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:59,343
and how much everyone loves you
and how great you're doing.

542
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,944
I just freaked out.
I'm sorry.

543
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:02,846
Long distance sucks.

544
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:06,450
It does.
But we can do this, right?

545
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:08,251
Yeah, definitely.

546
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,753
Can you come visit next month?

547
00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:11,621
We can take a proper tour
of the sights.

548
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:14,524
There's only one sight
I want to see right now.

549
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:16,626
All right,
I mean, this is getting weird,

550
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:18,829
but, uh, there it is.

551
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:20,764
I meant
the Jefferson Memorial,

552
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:21,765
you perv.

553
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,866
Right. Sorry.

554
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,768
Sorry, I-I don't, uh--

555
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:27,137
I'm--I'm just--

556
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:28,138
Wait.
No, you didn't.

557
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:30,207
No, I didn't.

558
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:32,607
- Spin it around and back it on up.
- All right.

559
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:37,296
The White House--
America's most whitest house--

560
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:39,932
most notably is
where Sinbad lived

561
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,134
in the film <i>First Kid.</i>

562
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:42,602
Sinbad, wow.

563
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:45,238
The other tour guide
never said anything about that.

564
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:48,107
Do you know why
it's called the Oval Office?

565
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:49,675
No.

566
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:51,677
Because of a man--
Oval Redenbacher...

567
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:53,179
- What?
- Popcorn inventor.

568
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:55,181
He used to hang out
with John F. Kennedy.

569
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:57,049
Excuse me.
Attention, everyone.

570
00:20:57,117 --> 00:20:58,384
This tour guide

571
00:20:58,452 --> 00:21:00,486
is the most amazing tour guide
there ever was.

572
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:02,889
Please, step up.

573
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:05,157
$200 cash up front.

574
