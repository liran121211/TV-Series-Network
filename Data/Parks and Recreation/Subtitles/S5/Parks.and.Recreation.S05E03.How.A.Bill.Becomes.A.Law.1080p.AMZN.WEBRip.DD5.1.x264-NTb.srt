1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:02,570
- HEY, THERE YOU ARE.
I MISS YOU.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,571
- I MISS YOU, TOO.

3
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:05,206
WHERE ARE YOU?

4
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:07,241
- I'M IN MY NEW
CITY COUNCIL OFFICE.

5
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,542
- NO WAY.
- I KNOW, DO YOU LIKE IT?

6
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,343
- I LOVE IT.

7
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,778
- I LOVE IT, TOO.
CHECK THIS OUT.

8
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:14,548
HERE IS MY WALL
OF INSPIRATIONAL WOMEN.

9
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:15,783
- AH.

10
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:17,251
IS THAT A PICTURE OF YOU?

11
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,586
- YES.
I AM BIG ENOUGH TO ADMIT

12
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:21,055
THAT I AM OFTEN INSPIRED
BY MYSELF.

13
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:23,524
HERE ARE MY CLOCKS.
PAWNEE AND WASHINGTON D.C.

14
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,392
- SAME TIME ZONE.

15
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,294
- OH, THIS IS
THE COOLEST PART EVER.

16
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:28,229
I HAVE MY OWN
PRIVATE BATHROOM.

17
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,363
- UH, OCCUPIED.
- OH, MY GOD.

18
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,832
- BLAH!

19
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:32,966
[toilet flushing]

20
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,236
- COUNCILMAN JAMM, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN MY BATHROOM?

21
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,405
- I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD
CALL IT YOUR BATHROOM.

22
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:39,240
- ITS ONLY DOOR
IS IN MY OFFICE.

23
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,444
- I THINK IT IS CRAZY THAT
THE MOST JUNIOR CITY COUNCILOR

24
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:46,480
GETS A PRIVATE BATHROOM
JUST BECAUSE SHE IS A GIRL.

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,317
- EXCUSE ME?
- LET'S SOLVE THIS.

26
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:50,218
TELL YOU WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.

27
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:52,253
I'M GOING
TO DROP MY LIQUIDS IN HERE,

28
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:53,687
TAKE MY SOLIDS
DOWN THE HALL.

29
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,823
DEAL?
- NO. NO DEAL.

30
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:58,359
- FINE.
YOUR LOSS.

31
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:01,395
- HOW?

32
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,365
[triumphant music]

33
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:12,440
*

34
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:22,616
- FUN FACT ABOUT ME.

35
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:26,787
I RECENTLY BEGAN
INTENSIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY.

36
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,322
I MAY HAVE MENTIONED THAT
TO YOU ALREADY.

37
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,790
- SEVERAL TIMES.

38
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,192
- WELL,
LIKE MY THERAPIST SAYS,

39
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,227
"YOU CAN'T SHARE TOO MUCH
OR TOO OFTEN."

40
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,129
- YOU KNOW, GAYLE AND I,
WE SAW A COUPLES THERAPIST

41
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,664
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
- THAT'S TOO MUCH, JERRY.

42
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:37,698
- FOR REAL.
KEEP US OUT YOUR BEDROOM.

43
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:38,532
- IT USED TO BE,

44
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,733
WHEN I WAS DOWN,
I CALLED MY MOTHER.

45
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,903
WHEN I LACKED SELF-CONFIDENCE,
I CALLED MY RUNNING COACH.

46
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:45,739
AND NOW, NO MATTER
WHAT EMOTION I'M FEELING,

47
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,676
I CALL ONE NUMBER--
MY THERAPIST.

48
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,345
I WANT TO DO THE SAME THING
FOR THE CITY.

49
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,347
- A PSYCHOTHERAPIST
FOR THE CITY.

50
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,348
- NO, ANDY.

51
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,483
- NO.
- A 311 LINE.

52
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:59,920
CITIZENS WILL CALL 311
FOR WHATEVER PROBLEM THEY HAVE.

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,556
UNCOLLECTED GARBAGE,
BROKEN STREETLIGHT,

54
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,626
AND WE WILL DIRECT THEM
TO THE PROPER DEPARTMENT.

55
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,295
- CHRIS, GREAT IDEA.

56
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,329
- THANK YOU, ANDY.
I AGREE.

57
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:09,163
I LOVE THIS IDEA.

58
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,465
AND I LOVE ME
FOR THINKING OF IT.

59
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,267
MY THERAPIST SAID THAT
I NEED TO BE MORE VOCAL

60
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,268
ABOUT APPRECIATING MYSELF.

61
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,803
THANK YOU, CHRIS.

62
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,871
YOU'RE WELCOME, CHRIS.

63
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,607
I SOUND INSANE.

64
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:20,874
I'M GOING TO GO TALK
TO MY THERAPIST.

65
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,610
- WELCOME TO PAWNEE TODAY.

66
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,579
I AM FIRST-RATE NEWSWOMAN
JOAN CALLAMEZZO.

67
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:30,318
PAWNEE'S CITY COUNCIL
APPROVAL RATE IS AT A DISMAL 3%.

68
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,420
THAT'S AN ALL-TIME LOW.
YUCK.

69
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,289
LESLIE, THE CITY COUNCIL
HAS DONE VERY LITTLE

70
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,824
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS,

71
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,792
AND WHAT THEY
HAVE ACCOMPLISHED,

72
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,229
IN MY OPINION,
HAS BEEN EMBARRASSING.

73
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:42,230
AND THAT IS A FACT.

74
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,931
- NO, THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

75
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,366
THAT'S THE DEFINITION
OF AN OPINION.

76
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,801
- WELL,
THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

77
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,638
- THE CITY COUNCIL
HAS SOME POLITICAL GRIDLOCK

78
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:51,872
AND SOME PARTISAN BICKERING,

79
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,707
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY
ABOUT TO PASS A BILL--

80
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,542
MY BILL--

81
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,310
THE LESLIE KNOPE
FUN IN THE SUN ACT,

82
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,313
WHICH WILL EXTEND
PUBLIC POOL HOURS CITYWIDE.

83
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,650
- [sarcastic laugh]
CAN YOU SAY, "BIG WHOOP"?

84
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,353
- RECENTLY, THE CAPTAIN OF
THE PAWNEE PORPOISES SWIM TEAM

85
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:08,256
ASKED ME IF WE COULD KEEP
THE PUBLIC POOLS OPEN LONGER

86
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,857
SO THEY COULD LOG
MORE PRACTICE TIME,

87
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,825
AND I SAID, "ABSOLUTELY."

88
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,827
BECAUSE NOT ONLY AM I
A CITY COUNCILOR.

89
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,330
I'M A CITY COUNCILOR
WITH PORPOISE.

90
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,365
[laughs]

91
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:20,734
BY PASSING THE BILL,
AND EXTENDING POOL HOURS,

92
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,937
WE ARE SAYING TO OUR CITIZENS
THAT THIS CITY COUNCIL

93
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,407
IS DETERMINED
TO BETTER OUR TOWN.

94
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,642
OKAY, PAWNEE PORPOISES
YOUTH SWIM TEAM,

95
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:29,477
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

96
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,011
WHAT IS YOUR
GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT?

97
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,646
- WE CAME IN FOURTH

98
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,881
IN THE COUNTY SWIM MEET
LAST YEAR.

99
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,549
- WRONG,
YOUR GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT

100
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,486
IS HAPPENING IN TWO HOURS
WHEN THIS BILL BECOMES LAW.

101
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:40,020
[applause]
- YAY.

102
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,088
- I JUST WANT YOU TO BE
VERY PROUD OF YOURSELVES,

103
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,325
BECAUSE THIS BILL IS GOING
TO START A LONG ROMANCE

104
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,626
BETWEEN THE CITY
AND ITS GOVERNMENT.

105
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:49,263
PORPOISE CALL!
[imitating porpoise noise]

106
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:52,966
[porpoise noise continues]

107
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,468
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

108
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,836
- I'M DOING A PORPOISE CALL,
WHICH WE USED TO DO

109
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,004
WHEN I
WAS PART OF YOUR GROUP,

110
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,272
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU DON'T DO IT ANYMORE

111
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,407
AND THAT'S FINE.

112
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,574
I'M NOT WEIRD.
OKAY, EVERYBODY LEAVE.

113
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,311
I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING.

114
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,945
- HEY, ARE YOU BUSY?

115
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,348
AND WRITING STAR TREK
FAN FICTION DOES NOT COUNT.

116
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:08,282
- HA HA HA.

117
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:11,018
I...FINISHED IT LAST WEEK.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

118
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,387
- UM, I MISS ANDY.

119
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,423
AND YOU PROBABLY MISS
YOUR LOVER, CHRIS.

120
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:16,123
- LESLIE.

121
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,491
- I HAD AN IDEA.
IT'S FRIDAY.

122
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,460
PAWNEE'S ONLY A TEN-HOUR DRIVE.
ROAD TRIP?

123
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,429
- OH, I DON'T KNOW,
I WAS GOING TO TRY TO GET A JUMP

124
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,063
ON SOME WORK THIS WEEKEND.

125
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,332
- DUDE, 30 YEARS FROM NOW,

126
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:26,467
WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR DEATHBED,
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO REMEMBER?

127
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,702
ORGANIZING FILES OR TAKING
A SPONTANEOUS ROAD TRIP

128
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:29,937
TO SURPRISE LESLIE?

129
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,440
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.

130
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,409
YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO SNEAK OUT EARLY.

131
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,044
YOU GET SNACKS.
I'LL BRING MUSIC.

132
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,812
WE'LL JAM OUT
TO SOME SWEET TUNAGE.

133
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,013
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS AWESOME.

134
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,049
- ACTUALLY, NO.
I DON'T WANT TO GO ANYMORE.

135
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,051
- OH. OKAY.

136
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,486
- JUST KIDDING.
SEE YOU IN TEN MINUTES.

137
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:46,487
- OKAY.

138
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:49,423
- JUST KIDDING.
WE'RE NOT GOING.

139
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,424
ROAD TRIP!

140
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:51,425
- SO WE'RE GOING?

141
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,693
- [frustrated]
YES!

142
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,062
- OH, I'M EXCITED
TO BOND A LITTLE WITH APRIL.

143
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,730
SHE'S LIKE THE LITTLE SISTER
I NEVER HAD.

144
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,333
BECAUSE THE LITTLE SISTER
I DO HAVE

145
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,503
IS NORMAL
AND NOT TERRIFYING.

146
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,006
- [mouths words]

147
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:10,611
- 311.
- WELL, DIANE, FOR POTHOLES,

148
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:11,945
YOU WANT TO SPEAK
WITH PUBLIC WORKS.

149
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:12,946
[phone ringing]

150
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,516
- I UNDERSTAND
YOU'VE TRIED THEM FOUR TIMES.

151
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,018
GOVERNMENT IS INEFFICIENT
AND SHOULD BE DISSOLVED.

152
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,987
PLEASE HOLD
WHILE I TRANSFER YOU.

153
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:20,921
- DONNA, CAN YOU HELP ME?

154
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:24,091
I GOT A 311 CALL,
BUT IT WAS ALL STATIC.

155
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,626
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
AN I.T. PROBLEM.

156
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,894
- WELL, HOW DO I
GET I.T. HERE?

157
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:29,062
- CALL 311.
[laughs]

158
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,400
- 311, HOW CAN I--

159
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,502
OH, HELLO AGAIN, DIANE.

160
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,970
NOBODY ANSWERED?

161
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,971
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

162
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,408
SOMEONE WILL BE THERE SHORTLY.

163
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:42,376
ANDREW, GET YOUR LUNCH,
SOME WATER,

164
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,445
AND A 40-POUND BAG
OF ASPHALT.

165
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:45,479
- OKAY, BOSS.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

166
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,647
- WE'RE FIXING A POTHOLE.
- HEY!

167
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,550
[phone ringing]

168
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,686
- PAWNEE 311.
HOW CAN I HELP--

169
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,154
OH, NO.
NO, THIS IS NOT 911.

170
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,088
NO, NO.
THIS IS 311.

171
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,925
DONNA, THEY SWITCHED MY PHONE
WITH 911.

172
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,126
WHAT DO I DO?

173
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,428
- I DON'T KNOW.
TRY TO HELP.

174
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:01,429
NOW HUSH.

175
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:03,597
IT IS HEATING UP
IN THIS PIECE.

176
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,765
- OH, THAT SOUNDS AWFUL.

177
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,435
- GOOD LORD,
IT IS HOT.

178
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:08,836
- YES, MERCY ME.

179
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,404
LIVING IN THIS TOWN'S
LIKE LIVING

180
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:11,171
IN THE DEVIL'S BUTT CRACK.

181
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,441
- ALMOST OUT OF GAS.

182
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,543
I'LL WAIT
TILL WE'RE ON THE HIGHWAY.

183
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:20,448
NOW, THE GPS SAYS
WE SHOULD TAKE 495 TO 270,

184
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,682
BUT CHECK OUT THIS
COOL ALTERNATE ROUTE I FOU--

185
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,484
- OH, MY GOD,
THAT IS SO INTERESTING TO ME

186
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,118
BECAUSE I'M A MAP SALESMAN.

187
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,820
WHY AREN'T WE MOVING?

188
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,889
- BECAUSE.
OTHER CARS.

189
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,990
[car horn honking]

190
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,091
- WILL YOU NOT DO THAT?
PLEASE DON'T.

191
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,159
- THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU--

192
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,628
- PLEASE DON'T DO--
OH, GREAT, HERE COMES A GUY.

193
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,163
- EXCUSE ME.
- MM-HMM?

194
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,865
- WHY AREN'T WE MOVING?
- EXIT'S CLOSED FOR A BIT.

195
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,166
PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE.

196
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:44,004
- I'LL JUST SHUT OFF THE CAR
TILL IT OPENS UP.

197
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,577
HOLY [bleep], IT'S HOT.

198
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,614
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

199
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,182
BEAUTIFUL, TOM.
BEAUTIFUL.

200
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,651
DYNAMITE GUMS.
- AW, THANKS.

201
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,187
- TOM, DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY I MOVED TO PAWNEE?

202
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,655
- SURE.

203
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,156
- IT'S BECAUSE
THE TWO LEADING INDUSTRIES HERE

204
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,158
ARE CORN SYRUP
AND RUBBER NIPPLES.

205
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,896
IT IS A DENTISTRY JACKPOT.
IT'S GENIUS, RIGHT?

206
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,898
- WELL, D.D.S. DOESN'T STAND
FOR "DUMB, DUMB, STUPID."

207
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:14,101
- [chuckles]
I LIKE THAT.

208
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,736
I'M GOING TO STEAL IT.
THAT'S MINE NOW.

209
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,037
- ALL RIGHT. COOL.

210
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,072
COUNCILMAN JAMM AND I
HAVE GOTTEN PRETTY TIGHT.

211
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,208
AND I'M HOPING TO PARLAY THIS
INTO A MEMBERSHIP

212
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,743
AT THE PAWNEE SMOKEHOUSE,

213
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,913
PAWNEE'S MOST EXCLUSIVE
CIGAR CLUB.

214
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,582
OVERSTUFFED LEATHER CHAIRS,
TOP-SHELF BRANDIES.

215
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,852
AND THAT STALE TOBACCO STENCH
THAT SAYS,

216
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,754
"WELCOME TO THE TOP."

217
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:36,256
YOU'RE A MEMBER
OF THE PAWNEE SMOKEHOUSE, RIGHT?

218
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,726
- OH, YEAH.
- MAN, I LOVE A GOOD STOGIE.

219
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:42,262
I ACTUALLY JUST HAD THIS
PERSONALIZED CIGAR CUTTER MADE.

220
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,531
- WHOA.

221
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:44,765
REAL NICE.

222
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,635
NOT MY INITIALS,
BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH.

223
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,036
- OH, WELL, IT'S NOT--

224
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,604
OKAY.

225
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,139
HEY, SO, UH,
WE'RE STILL ALL GOOD

226
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:52,940
ON LESLIE'S BILL, RIGHT?

227
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,110
- ACTUALLY, TOMMY,
WE NEED TO TALK.

228
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,246
- I HAVE WANTED THIS PERM
SINCE MIDDLE SCHOOL.

229
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,681
I COULD NOT BE
MORE EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

230
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,916
ARE YOU EXCITED, AUTUMN?
- YEAH, DEFINITELY.

231
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,086
- DO YOU EVER GIVE A PERM
TO SOMEONE AND EVER REGRET IT?

232
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,155
- UH...

233
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,824
- ANN HAS TOLD ME REPEATEDLY
NOT TO GET A PERM.

234
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,025
BUT ANN'S NOT HERE.

235
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,996
SO WHEN THE ANN'S AWAY,
THE MICE GET PERMS.

236
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,600
- COUNCILMAN JAMM
CHANGED HIS VOTE.

237
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,901
HE'S VOTING NO
ON FUN IN THE SUN.

238
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,036
- WHAT? WHY?
HE PROMISED ME.

239
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,905
- HE JUST SAID
THAT HE CHANGED HIS MIND.

240
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,040
THEN HE TOLD ME SOME VENEERS
COULD REALLY MAKE MY SMILE POP.

241
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,141
THOUGHTS?

242
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,276
- OH, MY GOD.
THE VOTE IS IN AN HOUR.

243
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:32,112
OKAY, WE NEED TO HAVE AN
EMERGENCY STRATEGY SESSION NOW.

244
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:35,115
- WHAT ABOUT THE PERM?
- THE PERM MUST WAIT, AUTUMN!

245
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,185
THE PERM MUST WAIT.

246
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,121
- WAIT,
SO DOES THIS MEAN THE BILL

247
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,823
ISN'T GOING TO PASS?

248
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,625
- MY PARENTS SAID THAT YOU GUYS
CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE.

249
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,693
- NOW, WAIT, OKAY, HOLD ON.

250
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,260
THIS ISN'T OVER
BY A LONG SHOT.

251
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,096
- BUT IT'S THREE TO TWO
AGAINST US.

252
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,197
- YEAH, I KNOW
HOW TO DO MATH, MASON.

253
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,899
OKAY, DON'T BE AN ALARMIST.

254
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,601
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT WE STAY POSITIVE.

255
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,669
OUR POSITIVE ATTITUDE
IS OUR GREATEST ASSET.

256
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,704
TOM, A WORD, PLEASE.
- MM-HMM.

257
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,672
- THE BILL IS DEAD,
THE PORPOISES ARE DOOMED,

258
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,774
AND DEMOCRACY IS OVER.
OH, MY GOD.

259
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,043
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I DECIDED TO GET A PERM.

260
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,912
ANN SHOULD HAVE NEVER
LET ME DO THIS.

261
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,714
- LOOK, JAMM SAW YOU
ON PAWNEE TODAY.

262
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,015
HE KNOWS HOW MUCH
YOU WANT THIS.

263
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:09,583
HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET
SOMETHING IN RETURN.

264
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,684
THIS IS A BARGAINING TOOL.

265
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:11,885
- YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHY
PEOPLE HATE THE GOVERNMENT.

266
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,922
'CAUSE JUST WHEN WE'RE ABOUT
TO DO SOMETHING REALLY GOOD,

267
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,924
IT ALL FALLS APART
DUE TO SOME STUPID,

00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,930
I'M JUST GOING TO TRY
TO GET COUNCILMAN MILTON'S VOTE.

271
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,698
- MILTON?
HE'S, LIKE, 150 YEARS OLD.

272
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,700
- YEAH.
HE'S GOT GRANDKIDS, OKAY?

273
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,801
AND--AND KIDS LOVE TO SWIM.

274
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:28,802
AND HE'LL GIVE US HIS VOTE.

275
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:29,903
HE'S AN OLD PERSON,

276
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,038
AND I'LL TALK TO HIM
REALLY SLOWLY.

277
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:31,905
HE WON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE'S DOING.

278
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,175
I JUST NEED TO HURRY UP.
HOW DO I LOOK?

279
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,745

HOW TO ANSWER THAT.

YOU HAVE TO ASK PERMISSION.

285

ABOUT THE FUN

316
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,850
AND I DON'T MEAN TO RUSH YOU,
BUT THE VOTE IS IN AN HOUR.

317
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,020
- WHEN I'M DONE EATING,
WE'LL TALK.

318
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,122
I'VE EATEN THE SAME LUNCH
FOR 58 YEARS.

COUNCILMAN MILTON WAS FIRST
ELECTED AS A CITY COUNCILOR

IN 1948, AS A MEMBER
OF THE DIXIECRAT PARTY.

324

THEIR PLATFORM?
"DE-INTEGRATE BASEBALL."

325
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,876
- THE SECRET
IS IN THE DRESSING.

326
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:20,480
TRY IT.
IT'S AN APHRODISIAC.

327
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,183
YOU TOO,

YOU CAN REALLY TASTE
THE IGNORANCE.

00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,849
- THAT LARGE BOY
IS MY COLLEAGUE.

340
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,017
WE WORK
AT THE PARKS DEPARTMENT.

341
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:00,387
- OH, YOU'RE NOT EVEN FROM
THE PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT?

342
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,255
- LOOK, IT APPEARED THAT NO ONE
FROM THE PROPER CHANNELS

343
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,892
WAS GONNA FIX THIS,
SO I DECIDED TO DO IT MYSELF.

344
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,493
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

345
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,996
- [chuckles]
YES, MA'AM.

346
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:11,264

00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,078
- RIGHT, TIM.

353
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,346
HOW MANY IS THAT?

354
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:30,183
- [laughs] YOU KNOW,
IT'S VERY HARD TO TELL.

355
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,418
THIS MIGHT NOT WORK.

356
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,519
- LET ME FIND JAMM,
SEE IF HE'LL BARGAIN.

357
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,787

365
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,303
- I'M GONNA MURDER YOU.

366
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,339

- LEMONADE?

370
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,485
- PLEASE AND THANK YOU.

371
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,821
- HEY, I'M SORRY
IF I WAS CURT EARLIER.

372
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,289
I'M A SINGLE MOM,
AND SOMETIMES THINGS

373
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,590
GET CHAOTIC AROUND HERE.

374
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,192
WHEN YOU SHOWED UP
FROM THE PARKS DEPARTMENT--

375
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,162
- NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.
I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY.

376
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,363
THIS IS DELICIOUS.

377
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,298
- WELL, I GOT IT
FROM FOOD AND STUFF, SO--

378
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,599
- THAT'S WHERE
I GOT THESE GLOVES.

379
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,501
- RIGHT?

380
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,404
SO, HOW EXACTLY ARE YOU
GONNA FIX THIS HOLE?

381
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,607
JUST FOR MY OWN EDIFICATION.

382
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,543
- UH, I DUG THE LOOSE GRAVEL
OUT OF THE HOLE.

383
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,446
NOW I'M USING A JACKHAMMER
TO REMOVE THE LARGER PIECES,

384
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,549
THEN I'LL SPRAY DOWN
THE HOLE TO SETTLE THE DUST

385
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,586
AND FILL IT
WITH COLD PATCH ASPHALT.

386
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,088
- WELL, THANK YOU.

387
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:44,925
NOW I CAN FIX
THE NEXT ONE MYSELF.

00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,468
- JAMM!
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

393
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,071
SUPPORT OF ONE OF YOUR BILLS?
COMMITTEE CHAIRMANSHIP?

394
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,173
- I WANT YOUR TOILET.
- WHAT?

395
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,275
- YOUR OFFICE,
WITH THE PRIVATE BATHROOM?

396
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,443
HE WANTS YOUR OFFICE.

397
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,112

TO BRAG, BUT, UH,

398

I'VE GOT
IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME.

399
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:08,415
- THIS ISN'T EVEN
ABOUT POLICY?

400
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,250
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
- THIS IS A NO-BRAINER.

401
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,319
JUST MAKE THE TRADE,
EVERYONE'S HAPPY.

402
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,653
- I'M NOT HAPPY.

403
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,322

A VERY HELPFUL BILL

WHEREVER HE WANTS?

ANDY, COME HELP ME
TAMP THIS DOWN.

00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,008
- HOLY MOSES.

413
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,010
- CAN WE TURN YOU
INTO A PRINCESS?

414
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,678
- NO.

415
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,413
- I THINK IT WOULD
REALLY MAKE DIANE HAPPY.

416
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,582
- WHY WOULD THAT MATTER?

417
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:43,683
SHUT UP.

418
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,152

- WOULD YOU PLEASE
COME HELP ME TAMP THIS DOWN?

420
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,621
IT'S A JOB
THAT REQUIRES TWO MEN.

421
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:52,225
- OR DOES IT REQUIRE
TWO PRINCESSES?

422
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,660
all: PLEASE?
PLEASE? PLEASE?

423

YOU REMIND ME OF A YOUNG,
BEAUTIFUL STROM THURMOND.

- YES, I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT
FOR YEARS.

427
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,538
- COUNCILMAN MILTON,
DO I HAVE YOUR VOTE?

OH, THERE'S A LOT OF
SALAD DRESSING ON YOUR HAND.

430
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,278

PLEASE,
STILL BE ABLE TO VOTE.

436
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,152
WE CAN KISS IF YOU WANT TO.

437
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,587
- WITH TONGUE?

438
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,921
- HEY! NO.

439
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:24,958
- SHE TRIED TO KISS ME.

440
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,326
SHE WAS INSATIABLE.

441
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,594
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE WE SHOULD, YOU KNOW,

442
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:28,561
POSTPONE THE VOTE

443
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,131
UNTIL THE COUNCILMAN
GETS BETTER, YOU KNOW?

444
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,333
- UH, YEAH, WE'RE NOT
POSTPONING ANYTHING, OKAY?

445
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,168
I'M PUSHING THE VOTE THROUGH
AND IT WON'T PASS.

I HAVE EXCELLENT
TOOTHBRUSH TECHNIQUE.

451
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,378
- JUST GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS.
TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT.

452
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,380
I ALWAYS DO.
IT'S SO EASY.

458
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:57,757
I TAKE IT BACK.
WHY DID I SAY THAT, TOM?

459
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,159
GOD, YOU KNOW ME SO WELL.

00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,103
AND YOU LIKE HER.
I CAN TELL.

511
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,205
- "A," I DON'T RECALL
INVITING YOU IN HERE,

512
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,606
AND "B," I DID NOT LIKE HER.

513
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,774
SHE'S NOT MY TYPE.

514
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,377
HER LIFE IS MESSY.

515
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,412
- RON, MESSY IS FUN, OKAY?

516
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,281
MY WHOLE LIFE
IS A GIANT MESS

517
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,415
AND I LOVE IT.

518
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,783
I MEAN, LOOK AT MY HAIR.

519
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,185
I HAVE GUM IN MY HAIR.

520
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,587
- LISTEN,
I WILL NOT PURSUE DIANE.

521
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,123
END OF STORY.

522
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,892
- PLEASE, JUST STEER.
- BE STRONGER.

523
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,495
OW.
- [sighs]

524
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,164
[car door slams]
THAT WAS A GREAT ROAD TRIP.

525
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,432
WE MADE IT 40 FEET.

526
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,201
- YEAH, WELL, AT LEAST
IT TOOK A MILLION HOURS,

527
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,235
AND IT WAS 180 DEGREES,

528
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,337
AND WE STARVED TO DEATH.
- SO FUN.

529
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,807
[laughter]

530
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,543
HEY, HOW ABOUT NEXT WEEKEND
WE FLY TO PAWNEE?

531
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:33,546
TICKETS ARE ON ME.
- REALLY?

532
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,548
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
DEFINITELY.

533
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:39,186
- NAH, NEVER MIND.
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

534
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:40,420
- WHAT?
OH, MY GOD.

535
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,256
- SEE HOW IT FEELS?
[laughter]

536
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,159
- EXCELLENT WORK, EVERYONE!

537
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,494
PARTICULARLY YOU, RON.

538
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,529
YOU HAVE ONE
VERY SATISFIED CITIZEN.

539
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,630
WHAT DID YOU DO FOR HER?

540
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,898
- I FIXED HER POTHOLE.

541
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,500
- IS THAT A EUPHEMISM?

542
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,802
- NO.
- THEN GREAT WORK.

543
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,603
IN FACT,
SHE'S OUT IN THE HALLWAY

544
00:18:56,603 --> 00:19:00,540
AND WANTS
TO THANK YOU HERSELF.

545
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,809
- IF YOU'RE HERE
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE POTHOLE,

546
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,811
I GUARANTEE
I DID IT CORRECTLY.

547
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,946
- ACTUALLY, I'M HERE
TO ASK YOU OUT FOR DINNER.

548
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:07,880
- REALLY?

549
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,849
- WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
THE KIND OF MAN

550
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,418
WHO NEEDS TO ASK
THE LADY OUT.

551
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,752
I'M A MIDDLE SCHOOL
VICE-PRINCIPAL.

552
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:16,223
I DON'T SCREW AROUND.
DOES THAT FREAK YOU OUT?

553
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,857
- NO, ON THE CONTRARY.

554
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,193
- SO, DINNER?

555
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,794
- PLEASE AND THANK YOU.

556
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,230
- WELL, IT'LL BE CASUAL.

557
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,333
NO NEED TO WEAR MAKEUP.

558
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,335
- I BEGRUDGINGLY ADMIT

559
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:32,305
THAT THE 311 PROGRAM
IS A MODERATE SUCCESS.

560
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,406
I'M STILL NOT SURE WHY

561
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:37,510
THE CITIZEN DECIDED TO COME
SPEAK WITH ME IN PERSON,

562
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,312
BUT I'M JUST HAPPY TO SEE

563
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,382
A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
FINALLY WORK.

564
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,952
- OKAY, SO LET'S GET READY
FOR THE PHOTO, GUYS.

565
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,854
I WANT YOU
TO ARRANGE YOURSELVES

566
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,690
FROM MOST EXCITED ABOUT
DEMOCRACY TO LEAST EXCITED.

567
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,292
WAIT A MINUTE.
EVERYBODY'S EXCITED?

568
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,460
I BET YOU ARE!

569
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,797
BECAUSE YOUR BILL
JUST BECAME LAW.

570
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,399
- BOY, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TRADED YOUR OFFICE

571
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,833
TO KEEP
THIS CRAPHOLE POOL OPEN

572
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,068
FOR A COUPLE MORE WEEKS
A YEAR.

573
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,903
- HEY, CAN YOU NOT SAY THAT
IN FRONT OF THE KIDS, PLEASE?

574
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,672
I'M TRYING TO TEACH THEM
HOW GREAT GOVERNMENT IS.

575
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,274
- OH, THIS IS
A TEACHING MOMENT?

576
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,776
GREAT.
HEY, UH, KIDS?

577
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:13,313
WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN
HOW LESLIE GOT YOUR BILL PASSED?

578
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,815
COUNCILWOMAN KNOPE
TRADED MY VOTE FOR HER--

579
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:19,286
- [gasps]
- [laughs]

580
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,753
- WHAT THE HELL, MAN?
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

581
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,322
- UM...

582
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:26,759
- UM, BECAUSE
IT'S FUN IN THE SUN!

583
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,429
EVERYBODY IN THE POOL!
[applause]

584
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,332
- YAY, POOL!

585
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,434
- YAY, DEMOCRACY!

586
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,502
OH, NO, MY PERM.

587
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,038
- TA DA.
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

588
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,408
- YOUR NEW CITY COUNCIL OFFICE.
- YES.

589
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,909
AND IT IS
ACROSS THE COURTYARD

590
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,045
FROM YOUR OFFICE,
SO WE CAN WAVE AT EACH OTHER.

591
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,548
BUT IT IS ALSO PAWNEE'S
NEWEST AND MOST EXCLUSIVE

592
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:51,984
CIGAR CLUB,
TOM'S SMOKEHOUSE.

593
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,920
- WHOA! "SMOKE DOG."

594
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,325
- AND THE TOMMY HAVERFORD
MEMBER'S CHAIR.

595
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,826
- NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

596
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,861
MAN, JAMM'S
GOTTA BE PRETTY MAD AT US.

597
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:02,962
- I AIN'T SCARED OF HIM.

598
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,064
HE'S A PUNK.

599
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,466
TO MAKING THINGS HAPPEN.

600
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,536
- I'LL PUFF TO THAT.

601
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,609
I DO NOT LIKE THIS.
