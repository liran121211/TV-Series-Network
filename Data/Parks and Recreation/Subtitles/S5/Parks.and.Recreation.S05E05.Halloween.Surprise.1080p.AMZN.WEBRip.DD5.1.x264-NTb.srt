HELLO, GIRLS.

00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,517
DIANE AND I HAVE BEEN SEEING
A LOT OF EACH OTHER, RECENTLY.

9
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,453
SHE IS A SHARP,
CONFIDENT, STRONG WOMAN.

10
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:21,189
HER CHILDREN ARE LOUD.

I'VE GOT IT.

21
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,440
- WE JUST WANTED TO INVITE YOU

22
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,109
TO COME TRICK
OR TREATING TONIGHT.

23
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,310
- [gasps]
- I THINK I'M A LITTLE OLD.

24
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,544
- CAN WE GO, RON, PLEASE?

25
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,114
PLEASE?

THE GOOD CANDY WILL BE GONE.

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,356
- BUT NO TRAMPOLINE ROOM,
CORRECT?

39
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:29,390
- CORRECT.

40
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,159
LIKE ALL HOUSES IN THE WORLD,

41
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,827
THERE'S NO TRAMPOLINE ROOM.
- MM.

00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,497
BEN IS COMING BACK

AND HE WE ARE MOVING
INTO A HOUSE TOGETHER.

NIGHTMARE HOARDER NEST.

- GREAT.

52
00:01:58,286 --> 00:01:59,520
- THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE
MORE DRAMATIC THAN THAT.

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,621
- HOLD ON.

54
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,690
OKAY, SAY IT AGAIN.

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,951
IT'S JUST A PIECE OF PAPER

67
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:34,388
AND HE ONLY MADE IT FOR ME AFTER
I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR IT

68
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:37,391
WHILE CRYING LOUDLY, BUT...

69
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,627
IT SURE MEANT A LOT
TO RECEIVE IT.

THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE

00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:56,577
I HOPE NO ONE MINDS
IF I LIVE TWEET THIS BITCH.

00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:57,811
- I AM COMING DRESSED
AS MY GREATEST FEAR,

77
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:01,382
BECAUSE DR. RICHARD NYGARD FEELS
THAT I SHOULD FACE MY FEARS

78
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,350
INSTEAD OF RUNNING FROM THEM.

79

HE'S VERY WISE.
I SEE HIM FIVE TIMES A WEEK.

SOME IDIOT KIDS WERE CAUGHT
POOPING ON THE SOCCER FIELD?

123
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,388
- OH, TOO BAD.

124
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:48,188
GUESS TRICK OR TREATING'S OVER.

125
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,624

00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,327
I MEAN, WE JUST GOT STARTED.

128
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:56,430
- OH, THAT'S SO SWEET OF YOU.

129
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,098

00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,375
- OKAY, LET'S GO
TO THE NEXT HOUSE.

133
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,110
- I NEED TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

134
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,348
- I-I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT.

135
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,049
- UH-OH.
[chuckles]

136
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,785
IT'S THE DEATH CANOE.

137
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,720
GET YOUR FOOT
OUT THE WATER, DUMBASS!

138
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,422
IT'S BLOOD LAKE.

139
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,757
- NOW, I MISSED THE FIRST THREE
DEATH CANOE FILMS.

140
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,826
WHY EXACTLY IS IT A DEATH CANOE?

141
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,028
DOES IT TIP OVER EASILY?
- READ MY TWITTER FEED.

142
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,564
I LIVE TWEETED THE FIRST THREE
THIS MORNING IN PREPARATION.

143
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:34,402
IN THE FIFTH ONE,
THE CANOE'S ACTUALLY THE HERO.

144
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:35,803
IT'S A CRAZY TWIST.

145
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,371
- HEY.

SO HOLD ON,
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

149
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,446
- IT MEANS JEN WANTS ME
TO KEEP WORKING FOR HER.

150
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:50,083
THERE'S A BUSINESSMAN IN FLORIDA
WHO WANTS TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR.

151
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,552
- FLORIDA?
THEY HAVE SHARKS IN FLORIDA.

152
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,120
AND SWAMPS.
AND SWAMP SHARKS.

153
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,422
- DO YOU MEAN ALLIGATORS?

154
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:56,123
- MAYBE.
LOOK, SO ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?

155
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,958
I--I MEAN,
I JUST APPLIED FOR A LEASE.

156
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,693
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO--
- I KNOW,

157
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,496
AND I KNOW THIS MAKES
THE FUTURE A LITTLE MURKY,

158
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,499
BUT RIGHT NOW EVERYTHING'S
REALLY PRELIMINARY, OKAY?

159
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,768
WE'LL KNOW MORE
IN A WEEK OR SO.

160
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:11,405
both: TRICK OR TREAT!

161
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:14,007
- 7:34 PM.
MAN DRESSED AS A NERD.

162
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,142
FEMALE DRESSED AS CRAZY WITCH.

163
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,177

164
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,648
- CASE CLOSED.
CANDY, PLEASE.

165
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:23,684
- RON, ZOE BROKE MY TIARA!

166
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,085
WE BOTH HAVE THE SAME TIARA.

167
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,120
NOW SHE HAS ONE AND I DON'T.

168
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,156
- OKAY.
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO, IVY!

169
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:33,026
- OKAY, WELL,
LET'S JUST EVEN THINGS OUT.

170
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:36,163
THERE. NOW NEITHER OF YOU
HAS A TIARA. PROBLEM SOLVED.

171
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:39,132
[both cry]

172
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:43,704
- OH!
- RIGHT IN HIS FACE!

173
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:47,040
"SORRY ABOUT YOUR JAW, SON."

174
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,275
- I MEAN, I JUST FEEL
SO POWERLESS.

175
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:51,479
JUST WHEN THINGS START TO TURN
AROUND AND THEY FALL APART.

176
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,181
NOW I KNOW EXACTLY HOW FDR
FELT AFTER PEARL HARBOR.

177
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,149
- LOOK, YOU GUYS
HAVE SURVIVED THIS LONG.

178
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,151
PLEASE DON'T LET THIS
RUIN YOUR NIGHT.

179
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,219
LET'S HAVE FUN.

180
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,554
IT'S HALLOWEEN.
YOU LOVE HALLOWEEN.

181
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,724
HEY, I KNOW
WHAT WOULD CHEER YOU UP.

182
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,459
LET'S GO WAIT OUTSIDE
THE BATHROOM FOR TOM

183
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,994
AND SCARE HIM.

184
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,562
- THAT WOULD CHEER ME UP.

185
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,564
- [chuckles softly]

186
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,132
OKAY.

187
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,867
READY AND...

188
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,836
BOO!
- [screams]

189
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,205
- [laughs]

190
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,941
- [flatulence]
- JERRY, GOD. GROSS.

191
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,076
- OH...

192
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,512
- JERRY?
- [flatulence continues]

193
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,614
GUYS, I--
[stomach gurgling]

194
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,181
- OH, GOD, I THINK HE MIGHT BE
HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

195
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,851
- WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- [flatulence]

196
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:31,919
UGH. SO MUCH STUFF
IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

197
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,754
- OKAY, CALL 911.
- OKAY.

198
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,689
- JUST BREATHE, OKAY?
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

199
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,791
- OH, GEEZ!
DID A DINOSAUR JUST FART?

200
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,026
JERRY, GET A GRIP.

201
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,260
- SORRY, GUYS.
[flatulence continues]

202
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,762
- UGH! APOLOGY NOT ACCEPTED.

203
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:42,963
- STOP TALKING, MORON.

204
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,197
- I WISH I COULD
STOP SMELLING.

205
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,933
- DUDE.

206
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,636
- SERIOUSLY, JERRY,
DID YOU EAT FARTS FOR LUNCH?

207
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:49,937
- TOM!
JERRY'S HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

208
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:50,938
- OH, NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

209
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,006
JERRY, YOU OKAY?
- [flatulence]

210
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,044
- OKAY, I GOT YOU
SOME MAGAZINES,

211
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,246
AND THOSE BORING
WORD JUMBLES YOU LIKE TO DO.

212
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,514
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU NEED, J?

213
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:01,582
MAYBE SOME GAS-X?

214
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,517
- HA HA, TOM.

215
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:04,918
- HOW IS HE, ANN?
GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT.

216
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:05,786
- HE'S GREAT.

217
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,688
HE SHOULD BE OUT OF HERE
IN A DAY OR TWO.

218
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:08,689
- DOCTOR, MEDICALLY SPEAKING,

219
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:09,890
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
WHAT HAPPENED TO JERRY?

220
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,592
- HE HAD A MILD HEART ATTACK.

221
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:16,697
- YEAH, BUT HE ALSO EXHIBITED
EXCESSIVE FLATULENCE.

222
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,732
IS THERE A TERM
FOR HAVING A HEART ATTACK

223
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,768
WHILE RELEASING SO MUCH GAS?

224
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,269
- NOT REALLY.

225
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:25,205
GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS IS
COMMON DURING A CARDIAC EVENT.

226
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,640
- I JUST WANT
TO HEAR THE DOCTOR

227
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,041
SAY THAT JERRY
HAD A FART ATTACK.

228
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,710
IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

229
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,244
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

230
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,081
LOOK AT ALL THE BALLOONS AND
THE FLOWERS AND THE FOOD AND--

231
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,584
MY GOODNESS, YOU'RE SO SWEET
TO COME VISIT THIS OFTEN.

232
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,318
- WELL, THEY DID CAUSE IT.
- HEY.

233
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,553
- NO.
THAT'S OKAY.

234
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,088
- I'M GLAD THIS HAPPENED.

235
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,823
I MEAN, I COULD DO WITHOUT
THE MESS OF HOSPITAL BILLS,

236
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,625
BUT NO, THIS WAS A WAKEUP CALL.

237
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,727
I'M GONNA MAKE SOME CHANGES.

238
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,262
I WANT AT LEAST ANOTHER 30 YEARS
WITH GAYLE AND MY GIRLS.

239
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,497
- DON'T WORRY, JERRY, OKAY?

240
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,834
YOU ARE GONNA HAVE THE FUTURE
THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS PLANNED.

241
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,803
JUST LEAVE IT TO US.

242
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,906
OKAY, SO I HAVE ARRANGED
FOR THE PARKS DEPARTMENT

243
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,775
TO THROW A HUGE GARAGE SALE
FUNDRAISER FOR JERRY

244
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,644
TO HELP PAY
FOR HIS HOSPITAL BILLS.

245
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,178
THE PAWNEE MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEE
HEALTH CARE PLAN

246
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,346
IS KINDA CRAPPY.

247
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,380
ONE TIME I SPRAINED MY WRIST

248
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,950
AND OUR INSURANCE CLAIMED
THAT HAVING A WRIST

249
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,652
WAS A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.

250
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,854
- BABE, HOW MUCH
SHOULD I SELL THIS HAT FOR?

251
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,623
- I DON'T KNOW, EIGHT CENTS?

252
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:16,924
- HONEY, THIS IS THE HAT
I WAS WEARING

253
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:19,627
THE FIRST TIME I EVER HEARD
VITALOGY BY PEARL JAM.

254
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:21,061
- OH, $900.

255
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,096
- YEAH, THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

256
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,932
RON, YOU'RE NOT SELLING
ANYTHING?

257
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,267
- I AM SELLING THIS TABLE.

258
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,603
I MADE IT.

259
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,038
- SO WHEN AM I GONNA MEET
YOUR NEW LOVER?

260
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,607
- I'M AFRAID THINGS HAVE HIT
A ROUGH PATCH WITH DIANE.

261
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,143
SHE WAS NOT PLEASED WITH
MY BABYSITTING PERFORMANCE

262
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,679
AND LEFT ME A VERY LOUD MESSAGE
ON MY CELL PHONE.

263
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,347
- I'M SURE SHE'LL GET OVER IT

264
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,616
IF YOU JUST
SAY YOU'RE SORRY THOUGH.

265
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:44,918
- I LIKE DIANE,
BUT I'M NOT SURE

266
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,655
IF I'M READY
FOR A WHOLE FAMILY.

267
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:49,623
IF THE KIDS EVER WANTED
TO COME TO MY PLACE,

268
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,625
I'D HAVE TO TAKE
A WHOLE WEEK OFF WORK

269
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,161
JUST TO UNDO THE ALARMS
AND TRIPWIRES.

270
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,697
- HEY, THAT'S MY NAME.

271
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,198
- YEAH,
THAT'S MY CHRIS TRAEGER BOX.

272
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,167
ALL THESE BOXES REPRESENT STUFF

273
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,102
FROM DIFFERENT ERAS
OF EX-BOYFRIENDS.

274
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,038
- OH...HERE ARE THOSE ANKLE
WEIGHTS I BOUGHT YOU

275
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,273

276

RECENTLY LESLIE POINTED OUT

277
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,877
THAT SOMETIMES
WHEN I DATE SOMEONE,

278
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:13,847
I KIND OF ADOPT
THAT PERSON'S PERSONALITY.

279
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,382
THE EVIDENCE
IS FAIRLY DAMNING.

280
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:18,018

- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
GOOD AFTERNOON.

286
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,398
AS MANY OF YOUR KNOW,

00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,767

A DEVASTATING FART ATTACK,

288
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,368

00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,738

295
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,985
THANK YOU SIR, FOR 20.
DO I SEE 30?

296
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,422
- MR. KURTZWILDER, IT MIGHT
BE HELPFUL IF YOU TOLD US

297
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:59,059
WHY YOU WANT TO BE
GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA.

298
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,260
- WELL, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY

299
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,362
MINE IS THE CLASSIC
FLORIDA SUCCESS STORY.

300
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,164
I WENT TO SFU LAW SCHOOL,

301
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,900
I WAS WORKING AT A SMALL FIRM
IN ORLANDO,

302
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,737
AND ONE DAY, BAM, JUST LIKE
THAT, GATOR EATS PENIS.

303
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,204
- EXCUSE ME?

304
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,439
- WELL, THAT WAS MY FIRST
HIGH PROFILE CASE.

305
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,074
IT WAS A CLASSIC
FLORIDA DIVORCE.

306
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,877
GUY CHEATS ON HIS WIFE
WITH DAN MARINO'S MASSEUSE,

307
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,412
ONE DAY SHE CUTS HIS JUNK OFF,
THROWS IT IN THE EVERGLADES.

308
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,481
- WHY NOT?
- DAMN ALLIGATOR ATE IT.

309
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,251
AND THAT CASE,
THAT CASE MADE MY CAREER.

310
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,987
NOW, I JUST WANNA
GIVE SOMETHING BACK.

311
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,890
- FRANKLY, YOUR PATH
TO VICTORY IS NARROW.

312
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,925
GOVERNOR SCOTT
MIGHT BE VULNERABLE,

313
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,795
BUT YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE
NAME RECOGNITION.

314
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,798
- BUT THE BARKLEY GROUP
IS THE BEST AT WHAT WE DO.

315
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:41,068
WE'RE NOT IN THE BUSINESS
OF LOSING ELECTIONS.

316
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:44,371
WE CAN GET YOU
WHERE YOU WANNA GO.

317
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,374
- I'M JUST SAYING, YOU SHOULD
HAVE PUT "SPOILER ALERT"

318
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,342
ON ALL THOSE DEATH CANOE TWEETS.

319
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,510
ALSO, NOT SAFE FOR WORK.

320
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,346
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF WHAT YOU
WROTE WAS REALLY PROFANE.

321
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,248
- THAT MOVIE'S 25 YEARS OLD,
MORRIS.

322
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,751
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE HOW I
TWEET, DON'T FOLLOW ME.

323
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,319
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

324
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,155
- I'M LIVE TWEETING
THIS DUMBASS CONVERSATION.

325
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,824
- YOU LIKE THAT COAT?
- YEAH.

326
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:06,259
BUT $200?
IT'S USED.

327
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,462
- I PAID 150 FOR IT,
THEN ADDED THE SCORPION.

328
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,798
- YOU CAN'T SELL CLOTHES
AT A TAG SALE

329
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,132
FOR MORE THAN THEY'RE WORTH.

330
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,500
- UM, WATCH ME.

331
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,803
- [knocks]

332
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:16,970
GOT A MINUTE?

333
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,971
- SURE.

334
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,940
I-I DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU

335
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,843
AFTER THE...YELLING
THAT OCCURRED.

336
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,111
- YEAH, I WAS A BIT STRESSED,

337
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:26,413
BUT I'M NOT HERE
TO MAKE EXCUSES.

338
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,150
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I AM
SORRY FOR THE WAY I REACTED.

339
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,419
- APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

340
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,788
- DO YOU WANNA
SAY ANYTHING TO ME?

341
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:38,425
- OH. YES.

342
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,360
YOU LOOK NICE TODAY.

343
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,496
- YOU BROKE
MY DAUGHTER'S TIARA.

344
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,465
YOU RUINED THEIR HALLOWEEN.

345
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:50,370
DON'T YOU FEEL
A LITTLE BIT BAD ABOUT THAT?

346
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,505
- OKAY--
- UM.

347
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,241
TOO LATE.

348
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:58,545
GOOD-BYE.
- [clears throat]

349
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,080
DUDE, YOU'RE TOTALLY
BLOWING THIS.

350
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,549
- I'M NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE.

351
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,318
IT WASN'T EVEN A REAL TIARA,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

352
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,021
OH, WELL, RELATIONSHIP OVER.
TOO BAD.

353
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,857
- OH, MY GOD, YOU ARE SO SAD.

354
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:12,492
- I AM NOT.
- RON, SHE'S RIGHT.

355
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,527
I'VE TRAINED EXTENSIVELY
IN THE ART OF OBSERVATION.

356
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,164
YOU ARE SAD, AND WE KNOW WHY.

357
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,166
YOU DIDN'T SELL YOU TABLE.

358
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,002
AND IT'S PROBABLY
A LITTLE TOO EXPENSIVE.

359
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,337
- SHH. NO.

360
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,339
- OKAY, THIS IS OUR
FINAL AUCTION ITEM.

361
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,175
IT'S A ONE-OF-A-KIND AUTOGRAPH

362
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:31,144
FROM MAYOR GUNDERSON'S DOG,
RUFUS.

363
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,479
YEAH, WE NEED SOME BIG BIDS--
[phone rings]

364
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,347
OH, EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND.

365
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,850
UM, CAN YOU--T--JUST--OKAY.

366
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,152
HEY, HOW WAS THE MEETING?

367
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,523
- KURTZWILDER WANTS ME TO RUN
HIS CAMPAIGN FROM FLORIDA.

368
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:47,027
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHEN
THE JOB WOULD EVEN STARTS,

369
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,362
BUT OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD MEAN
PUTTING OUR PLANS ON HOLD.

370
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,563
- WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

371
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,565
OBVIOUSLY YOU GOTTA
TAKE IT, RIGHT?

372
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,267
- NO, I MEAN,
I'M NOT MAKING ANY DECISIONS

373
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,403
UNTIL WE TALK ABOUT THIS
AND EVERYTHING IT WOULD MEAN.

374
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,438
LOOK, I'M FLYING BACK
TO WASHINGTON.

375
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,472
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET THERE.
OKAY?

376
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,108
- YEAH, OKAY.

377
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,110
- LOVE YA.

378
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,246
- $55. GREAT.
OKAY, COME ON, $60?

379
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:07,414
$65 ANYBODY?

380
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,950
HEY, WE'RE UP TO $60,
NOT BAD, RIGHT?

381
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,251
- YES, ANN, BAD.

382
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,420
YOU MIGHT NOT CARE
ABOUT JERRY'S FUTURE, BUT I DO.

383
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,056
OKAY? WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING
VERY DRASTIC SO HE CAN BE HAPPY,

384
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,458
SO WE CAN ALL BE HAPPY.

385
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,993
UH, ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

386
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,028
- DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

387
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,229
BUT I'M DEFINITELY NOT THINKING

388
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,463
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
- GOOD IDEA, ANN.

389
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,099
OKAY, WE HAVE A NEW ITEM
UP FOR BID.

390
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,201

393
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,942
LOOK AT HER, FOLKS.

394
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,376
ONE EVENING WITH THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD.

395
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,978
JUST DINNER AND DANCING,
NOTHING SEXUAL.

396
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,180
UNLESS SHE'S INTO THAT,
BUT NO, SHE'S NOT.

397
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,414
NOTHING FRESH.
DON'T EVEN TRY IT.

398
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,615
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW, RIGHT?
- NO!

399
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,251
- NO, SHE'S NOT INTO IT.
DON'T TRY ANYTHING,

400
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,385
BUT, YOU KNOW, GIVE IT A SHOT.

401
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,586
EITHER WAY,
IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

402
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,622
LET'S RAISE SOME MONEY.

403
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,625
- PLEASE, WE NEED TO DO THIS

404
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,961
FOR JERRY AND HIS FUTURE.

405
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,262
THIS COULD BE GREAT, YOU KNOW?

406
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,696
THREE OUT OF FOUR
MARRIED COUPLES

407
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,231
HAVE MET EACH OTHER
AT SPONTANEOUS AUCTIONS.

408
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,632
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.

409
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,370
- I D--WELL, I DON'T KNOW, I--
- $100.

410
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,106

413
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,512

MOST ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN I KNOW.

414
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,646
AND CHECK OUT THAT BOD.

415
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,681
CAN I GET 3? $300.

416
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,516
- 500.

417
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,018

420
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:25,258
- WOW, 900 FROM THE MAN WITH
THE TANK TOP AND THE TATTOOS.

421
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,659
THAT'S SO GREAT.
LET'S BEAT THAT, SHALL WE?

422
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,962
WHO WANTS TO BEAT IT?
ANYBODY BEAT IT PLEASE?

423
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,130
- I'M SORRY, I'M OUT.

424
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,564
I WOULDN'T SELL HER
TO THAT GUY, THOUGH.

425
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,699
JUST ONE MAN'S OPINION.

426
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:33,666
- OKAY...

427
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,470
SIR, WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WITH YOUR $900 DATE?

428
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,709
HOW WOULD YOU, UH, UM...WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO TO HER?

429
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:43,743
- I DON'T KNOW.

430
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,013
MY COUSIN'S GOT A KICKASS
MUD PIT IN HIS YARD.

431
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:47,214
SHE COULD WATCH ME
DO BELLY FLOPS

432
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:48,748
THEN WE MAYBE WE COULD
GET SOME THAI FOOD

433
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,218
AND A TANK OF NITROUS
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

434
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:54,121
- OH, THAT'S NOT AS BAD
AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

435
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,755
- I AM GOING TO BID
A MILLION DOLLARS ON MYSELF.

436
00:15:55,755 --> 00:16:00,027
GOING ONCE, GOING NEVER, SOLD.

437
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,630
- WHAT UP, PLAYBOY?

438
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,298
YOU LIKE THAT JACKET?

439
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,034
IT'S A PRETTY DOPE CUT, RIGHT?

440
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,535
- YEAH.
CAN I HAVE IT, MOM?

441
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,736
- I COULD WEAR IT TO HOMECOMING.

442
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:10,870
- 300 BUCKS FOR SOMETHING

443
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,773
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GROW OUT OF
IN A MONTH? FORGET IT.

444
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:16,276
- WAIT, I CAN RENT IT TO YOU.

445
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,045
- REALLY?

446
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,613
- YEAH, IT'S PART
OF A BUSINESS I RUN.

447
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,715

448
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,217
AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEENS.

449
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,386
THAT JACKET IS 20 BUCKS A WEEK.

450
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,088
- DONE.

451
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,789
THIS IS A GREAT IDEA.

452
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,092
HE GROWS SO FAST I NEVER WANNA
BUY HIM ANYTHING NICE.

453
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,061
WHAT'S THE NAME
OF YOUR BUSINESS?

454
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,029
- RENT-A-SWAG.

455
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,066
- I'M SORRY, JERRY, BUT YOUR
FUTURE HAS BEEN CANCELED.

456
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,034
WE ONLY RAISED $1,200.

457
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,702
- LESLIE, THANK YOU.

458
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,204
THAT IS AMAZING.

459
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,372
- NO, IT STINKS.

460
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,074
IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE
TO WHAT YOU NEED.

461
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:49,042
WITH ALL YOUR BILLS,

462
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,777
AND THE INEVITABLE
FOLLOW-UP PROBLEMS,

463
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,213
AND THE LIFETIME OF CHRONIC
MISERY THAT AWAITS YOU.

464
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,781
I MEAN,
YOU HAD THIS WHOLE PLAN

465
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,749
FOR YOUR RETIREMENT
AND YOUR BEACH HOUSE

466
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,820
AND NOW YOU'RE FUTURE
IS JUST A HUGE PILE OF CRAP.

467
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,290
- LESLIE, YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY
PLAN YOUR FUTURE.

468
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,125
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO GUARANTEES
IN THIS WORLD.

469
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,328
AS LONG AS THE PEOPLE I LOVE
ARE A PART OF MY LIFE

470
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,797
I WILL BE JUST FINE.

471
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:13,400
YOU WANNA STICK AROUND?

472
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,701
WATCH SOME OF MY STORIES
WITH ME?

473
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,537
TONIGHT'S STRAWBERRY
JELL-O NIGHT!

474
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,073
- OH, MY GOD, YOUR LIFE
IS SO DEPRESSING.

475
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,774
NO THANK YOU.

476
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,077
[knock on glass]

477
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:27,314
- NEVER SEEN ANYONE
MORE TORTURED OVER GOOD NEWS.

478
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,249
- I'M SORRY, I DON'T MEAN
TO SEEM UNGRATEFUL.

479
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,651
I JUST, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A LOT TO CONSIDER.

480
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,519
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, I GET IT.

481
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,154
FEELINGS AND GIRLFRIEND
AND WHATEVER.

482
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:37,157
THE POINT IS JUST YESTERDAY
YOU SAID TO ME,

483
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:40,360
"I'M NEVER HAPPIER THAN
WHEN I'M MANAGING A CAMPAIGN."

484
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,694
- I DON'T THINK I SAID THAT.

485
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,096
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

486
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,431
I WATCHED YOU IN FLORIDA.

487
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:45,765
YOU WERE SAYING IT
WITH YOUR HEART.

488
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,867
- WOW, YOU ARE
REALLY GOOD AT THIS.

489
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,636
- YES, I AM.
I'M AMAZING.

490
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,838
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
SO ARE YOU.

491
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:55,408
THERE AREN'T A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT CAN MANAGE A CAMPAIGN.

492
00:17:55,408 --> 00:18:01,814
BUT YOU, BEN WYATT,
ARE ONE OF THEM.

493
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,418
SO, JUST TAKE TONIGHT AND
JUST THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

494
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,691
[doorbell rings]

495
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,760
- HELLO, DIANE.

496
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,796
I HAVE BROUGHT YOU FLOWERS.

497
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,832
ALSO CHOCOLATES.

498
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,534
AND SOME GROUT CLEANER.

499
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,903
I NOTICED YOU NEEDED GROUT
CLEANER, SO I BROUGHT THAT TOO.

500
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,873
- VERY ROMANTIC.

501
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,176
MY KIDS ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE, RON.

502
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,444
IT'S A PACKAGE DEAL.

503
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:36,149
- I KNOW.
I'M SORRY, DIANE. I REALLY AM.

504
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,618
I'VE BEEN ALONE
MOST OF MY LIFE BY CHOICE

505
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,221
AND KIDS--

506
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,391
THIS IS ALL NEW FOR ME.

507
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,393
BUT I'D LIKE TO BECOME
FAMILIAR WITH IT

508
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,729
IF YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO PROVE MYSELF.

509
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,533
I DID BRING THE GIRLS
SOMETHING.

510
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:57,704
I THOUGHT I COULD
TEACH 'EM TO SAW.

511
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:58,905
[slight laugh]

512
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,673
I NOW REALIZE
THAT SEEMS DANGEROUS.

513
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:01,874
- [laughs]

514
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,945
- WELL, MY BOYFRIEND MIGHT NOT
BE MOVING BACK FOR A WHILE

515
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,880
SO I HAVE TO BACK OUT.

516
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,850
JUST WANTED TO LOOK
AT IT ONE MORE TIME.

517
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,552
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T GIVE YOU
YOUR DEPOSIT BACK.

518
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:13,786
- I KNOW.

519
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,922
- AND THERE'S A $300--
- ALL RIGHT, MARTHA.

520
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:19,792
I GET IT.

521
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,962
ACTUALLY, IS THERE A WAY
I COULD PUT DOWN, LIKE A--

522
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,631
HEY.
- HEY.

523
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:25,932
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
COMING BACK HERE.

524
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:29,869
- OH.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

525
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,639
OH, MY GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

526
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:36,709
- I'M THINKING ABOUT MY FUTURE.

527
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:43,650
I AM DEEPLY,
RIDICULOUSLY IN LOVE WITH YOU

528
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,753
AND ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE,
I JUST--

529
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,555
I WANNA BE WITH YOU FOREVER.

530
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:53,560
SO, LESLIE KNOPE, WILL--
- WAIT. WAIT.

531
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,994
OKAY?
- OKAY.

532
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,897
- JUST--I NEED TO REMEMBER THIS.
- SURE.

533
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,933
- GIMME A SECOND.
- OKAY.

534
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,504
LESLIE K--
- NO, NO, NO, NO, HOLD ON.

535
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:05,938
JUST--I NEED ANOTHER SECOND,
PLEASE.

536
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:12,845
I NEED TO REMEMBER EVERY LITTLE
THING ABOUT HOW PERFECT

537
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:16,716
MY LIFE IS RIGHT NOW
AT THIS EXACT MOMENT.

538
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,785
- OKAY.

539
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,895
- [laughs]
- ARE YOU GOOD?

540
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,297
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

541
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:31,931
- I'M GOOD.

542
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:36,002
- LESLIE KNOPE, WILL YOU--
- YES!

543
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,344
- MARRY ME?
- OH, YEAH.

544
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,313
- OKAY. GREAT.
[both laugh]

545
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,916
all: TRICK OR TREAT!

546
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,484
- IT'S NOVEMBER 8th.

547
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,986
- YES, WELL, THESE GIRLS
DIDN'T GET A CHANCE

548
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,054
TO GO TRICK OR TREATING

549
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,689
SO SOMEWHERE IN THIS HOUSE

550
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,425
THERE IS SOME CANDY.

551
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,328
WHY DON'T YOU FIND IT AND WE'LL
GET RIGHT OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

552
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:05,432
- ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

553
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,401
- YOU HAVING FUN, LADIES?
both: YEAH!

554
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:13,440

UH, CALCIUM CHEWS

555
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,675
AND, UH, A ROLL OF COOKIE DOUGH.

556
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:16,976
- OKAY, WHAT DO YOU SAY, GIRLS?

557
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,878
both: THANK YOU!

558
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,647
- TREMENDOUS.

559

APPRECIATE IT.
