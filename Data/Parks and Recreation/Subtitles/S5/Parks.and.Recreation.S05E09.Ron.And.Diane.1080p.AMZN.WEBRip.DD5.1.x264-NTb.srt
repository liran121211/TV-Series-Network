1
00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:03,037
- MERRY CONGRATU-CHRISTMAS!

2
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:04,738
- WHAT?
- HALF "MERRY CHRISTMAS,"

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,207
HALF "CONGRATULATIONS,"

4
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:07,608
BECAUSE
I JUST RECEIVED SOME NEWS.

5
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:11,245
YOU, RON SWANSON,
HAVE BEEN NOMINATED FOR AN AWARD

6
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,181
FROM THE INDIANA
FINE WOODWORKING ASSOCIATION.

7
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:15,249
- HOW DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT THAT?

8
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,550
- I'VE HAD
A "RON SWANSON" GOOGLE ALERT

9
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,786
FOR SEVEN YEARS
AND IT FINALLY PAID OFF.

10
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:22,090
- RECENTLY,
I MADE A CHAIR.

11
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,793
WHEN I WAS FINISHED,
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD CHAIR.

12
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:29,230
I SUBMITTED IT TO THE INDIANA
FINE WOODWORKING ASSOCIATION,

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,301
WHO FELT IT MERITED
CONSIDERATION FOR AN AWARD.

14
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,436
[chuckles]
IT'S BEEN A REAL WHIRLWIND.

15
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:36,604
I HAVE TO CONFESS,

16
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,506
I'M VERY HONORED
BY THIS NOMINATION.

17
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:39,673
- RIGHT?

18
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,841
- THIS MIGHT BE
THE FIRST TIME

19
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,510
I'VE EVER WANTED
TO ATTEND AN EVENT.

20
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,645
- OH, MY GOD,
I LOVE EVENTS!

21
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:45,813
I CAN'T WAIT
TO GO TONIGHT.

22
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,315
- WHY ARE YOU GOING?

23
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:49,150
- AS YOUR SELF-APPOINTED
EMOTIONAL GUARDIAN,

24
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,452
IT IS MY DUTY
TO LOVE AND SUPPORT YOU.

25
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:52,453
PLUS, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

26
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:53,687
YOU SHOULDN'T
BE THERE ALONE.

27
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,389
- THAT'S CORRECT.
I'M BRINGING DIANE.

28
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,390
THINGS ARE GOING
VERY WELL WITH US.

29
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,626
- EVEN BETTER.
I AM VERY EXCITED TO MEET DIANE.

30
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,561
- YOU'RE NOT TAKING "NO"
FOR AN ANSWER, ARE YOU?

31
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,395
- OH, I FORGOT
TO SING YOU

32
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,197
MY MERRY CONGRATU-CHRISTMAS
CAROL.

33
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:06,300
* JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE YAY,
JINGLE GOOD FOR YOU *

34
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,235
- GET OUT.
- YUP.

35
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:10,238
[triumphant music]

36
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:18,312
*

37
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:30,124
- HOW ABOUT THE NEW SUSHI PLACE
IN EAGLETON?

38
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:31,091
- I'M ALLERGIC
TO SUSHI.

39
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,761
EVERY TIME I EAT
MORE THAN 80 SUSHIS, I BARF.

40
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,863
- HEY, ANN, YOU BEEN TO
ANY SWANKY RESTAURANTS LATELY?

41
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,298
- WHAT'S THE OCCASION?
- IT'S DECEMBER.

42
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,566
IT'S THE TIME
WE CELEBRATE

43
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,135
OUR MOST SACRED
AND SPECIAL EVENT:

44
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,204
* JERRY DINNER
- * JERRY DINNER

45
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:46,707
- * JERRY DINNER
- * JERRY DINNER

46
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:47,841
- WHAT THE HELL
IS JERRY DINNER?

47
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,611
- EVERY TIME WE LAUGH
AT SOMETHING STUPID JERRY DOES,

48
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,646
WE PUT A DOLLAR
IN THIS BOX.

49
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,782
AT THE END OF THE YEAR,
WE TAKE ALL THE CASH

50
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,185
AND TREAT OURSELVES
TO A FANCY DINNER.

51
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,619
THIS YEAR, WE HAVE...

52
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,622
$516.

53
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,425
[cup spilling]
- AW, JEEZ!

54
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:06,727
- AND THAT'S 517.

55
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,530
- [gasps]
OH!

56
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,199
- 518.

57
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,303
- YOU GUYS,
THAT'S SO MEAN.

58
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,605
- IT'S NOT MEAN
IF HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

59
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,707
IT'S LIKE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE
BEHIND THEIR BACKS.

60
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,775
EVERYBODY WINS.
- NO.

61
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,212
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
INVITE JERRY TO THE DINNER.

62
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:25,145
- HA!

63
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,248
THAT'S HILARIOUS.
YOU SHOULD DO STAND-UP.

64
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,917
- IF YOU'RE KIDDING, YOU SUCK,
BUT IF YOU'RE SERIOUS,

65
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,652
I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT.

66
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:35,923
HEY, APRIL, MATLOCK CALLED.
HE WANTS HIS CARDIGAN BACK.

67
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,326
BOOM! I'M OUT.

68
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:40,361
- WHO'S MATLOCK?

69
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,362
[knocking at the door]
- HEY, BUD.

70
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:42,630
- HEY!
- HOW ARE YOU?

71
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,466
- GREAT. I JUST FINISHED MAKING
AN ENTRY IN MY DREAM JOURNAL.

72
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:50,738
THIS TIME, THE GIANT SPIDER
GOT CAUGHT IN MY WEB.

73
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,373
[laughs]

74
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,874
PROGRESS.

75
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,410
- SO I FEEL LIKE WE HAVEN'T
GOTTEN A TON OF TIME TOGETHER

76
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,212
SINCE I GOT BACK
FROM D.C.

77
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,348
- WELL, WE BOTH
ARE IN SERIOUS RELATIONSHIPS.

78
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:03,251
YOU HAVE LESLIE
AND I HAVE MY THERAPIST,

79
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,453
DR. RICHARD NYGARD,
WHO I SEE 15 TIMES A WEEK.

80
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:08,656
- WELL, LESLIE HAS PLANS
TONIGHT, SO I'M SOLO.

81
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,724
YOU WANNA HANG OUT?
- I'D LOVE TO.

82
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,227
IT--IT'LL BE JUST LIKE
OLD TIMES IN INDIANAPOLIS.

83
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:15,496
WE'RE BACK.
- ALL RIGHT.

84
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,698
[groans]

85
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,368
LOTS OF HUGS.

86
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:23,304
- WELCOME TO THE INDIANA
FINE WOODWORKING AWARDS,

87
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,739
OR AS I LIKE TO CALL IT,
HEAVEN.

88
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,007
- RON.
- AH!

89
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,277
LESLIE, MAY I PRESENT
DIANE LEWIS?

90
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:30,711
- OH.
- DIANE, THIS IS LESLIE KNOPE.

91
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,281
- DIANE, WOW. RON HAS TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU,

92
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,416
IN THAT HE HAS TOLD ME YOUR NAME
IS DIANE, AND YOU EXIST.

93
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,417
[laughs]
- OH, YEAH.

94
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:37,585
HE'S NOT
A BIG SHARER.

95
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,287
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HIS MIDDLE NAME IS.

96
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:40,454
- OH, IT'S ULYSSES.

97
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,290
- I CAN SEE
WHY HE DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.

98
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,325
- [laughs]
- MARY, MOTHER OF GOD.

99
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:46,360
[giggles]

100
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,895
THAT'S
CHRISTIAN BECKSVOORT!

101
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,830
HE'S THE MODERN MASTER
OF THE SHAKER STYLE.

102
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,600
I NEVER DREAMED THAT I WOULD
SEE HIM IN THE FLESH. [laughs]

103
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,402
- GO OVER
AND SAY HELLO.

104
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,704
- NO, I'M SURE HE GETS SWAMPED
WITH ATTENTION ALL THE TIME.

105
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,507
OOH, IF YOU LADIES
WILL EXCUSE ME,

106
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:02,042
THERE IS A JACK PLANE
THAT NEEDS MY ATTENTION.

107
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,877
- GO ON THEN.

108
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,979
- SO TELL ME
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF:

109
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,915
YOUR KIDS,
YOUR HOBBIES.

110
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:08,982
WHAT ARE
YOUR FIVE BIGGEST HOPES,

111
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,251
DREAMS, FEARS,
AND REGRETS?

112
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,754
- IN HONOR
OF JERRY DINNER,

113
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:17,291
LET'S EACH SAY OUR FAVORITE
JERRY MOMENT FROM THE PAST YEAR.

114
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,926
- YES.
- MINE WAS...

115
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,561
THE TIME
HE SLIPPED ON A CINNABON

116
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,962
AND LANDED
IN A BUNCH OF GARBAGE.

117
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,163
[laughter]

118
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:26,534
- MY FAVORITE JERRY MOMENT
WAS WHEN HE ATE A BOWL OF GLUE.

119
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,402
[laughter]

120
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:29,670
- MY FAVORITE JERRY MOMENT
IS WHEN

121
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,073
YOU SWITCHED OUT HIS POTATO SOUP
WITH GLUE AND HE DIDN'T KNOW.

122
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,475
[laughter]
YOU'RE SO CUTE

123
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,509
WHEN YOU'RE BULLYING,
BABE.

124
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,478
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
ANN WAS RIGHT.

125
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,381
THIS IS MEAN.
WE ARE GOING TO PICK UP JERRY.

126
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,749
- WHAT?
both: NO!

127
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,751
- IT'S CHRISTMASTIME. DON'T YOU
WANT TO BE GOOD PEOPLE?

128
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,018
- NOT REALLY.
- NEVER.

129
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:45,853
- HEY,
IF WE'RE GOING THAT WAY,

130
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:46,687
CAN WE STOP AT OUR PLACE
REAL QUICK?

131
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,589
'CAUSE I FORGOT
TO PUT ON DEODORANT.

132
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,392
AND A JACKET
AND ONE OF MY SOCKS.

133
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:53,794
PLUS, I GOTTA POOP, BUT
I COULD STOP ANYWHERE FOR THAT.

134
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,030
- I KNOW YOU DIDN'T, BUT IF YOU
HAD GONE TO HOGWARTS ACADEMY,

135
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,432
WHICH HOUSE DO YOU THINK
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN?

136
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,468
- [scoffs]
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY,

137
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:01,602
I WANT TO SAY GRYFFINDOR...
- [chuckles]

138
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,404
- BUT I'VE GOT TO GO
WITH HUFFLEPUFF.

139
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,638
- I RESPECT
YOUR HONESTY.

140
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,408
GRYFFINDOR.
SEEKER ON THE QUIDDITCH TEAM.

141
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,910
- DIANE, THAT'S MY CHAIR,
RIGHT THERE.

142
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,746
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL, RON.
YOURS IS THE WINNER.

143
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,648
- I'M NOT SURE
I STAND A CHANCE.

144
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,718
- HEY,
YOU MOST CERTAINLY DO.

145
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,120
THEY'D BE CRAZY
NOT TO VOTE FOR YOU.

146
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,589
- WHICH ONE IS RON'S?

147
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,724
- I DON'T KNOW.
- [laughs]

148
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,893
SMART, FUNNY,
INDEPENDENT, AND SEXY?

149
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:29,397
DIANE LEWIS?
MORE LIKE DIANE SAWYER.

150
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:32,400
- WHOA! WHAT IS GOING ON
AT THE GERGICHES?

151
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,734
- WHOA.

152
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,903
- OH, MY GOD! JERRY'S HAVING
A CHRISTMAS PARTY!

153
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,137
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE DIDN'T INVITE US.

154
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,572
[thud]
- HOW DARE HE!

155
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,673
WHAT'D WE EVER
DO TO HIM?

156
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,008
- IT'S PROBABLY
JUST FAMILY.

157
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,043
- [gasps]
AND BEN AND CHRIS.

158
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:46,447
- AND ANN. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE KNEW JERRY.

159
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:49,883
- WOW. THE GERGICHES
REALLY GO ALL OUT.

160
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,985
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

161
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,787
- MMM!
THIS IS LITERALLY

162
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,023
THE BEST NON-FAT EGG NOG
I'VE EVER HAD.

163
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,959
- REMAIN CALM,
BUT I THINK YOU JUST DRANK

164
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,062
SOME OF THE REGULAR,
FULL-FAT EGGNOG.

165
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,565
CHRIS,
ONE CUP WON'T KILL YOU.

166
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:08,101
- NO, BUT IT WILL ADD
EXACTLY 440 CALORIES.

167
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,872
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M FINE.

168
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,075
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.

169
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,578
MMM! I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THIS,

170
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:18,779
BUT THINGS
WITH FAT IN THEM

171
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,914
TASTE WAY BETTER
THAN THINGS WITH NO FAT.

172
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,983
- HEY, CHR--
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

173
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:26,019
- RON, GUESS
WHY MY THUMBS ARE UP.

174
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,154
- NO.

175
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,957
- BECAUSE I'M GIVING YOU
MY 100% APPROVAL ABOUT DIANE.

176
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:32,159
SHE IS PERFECT FOR YOU.
SHE GETS YOU.

177
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,563
SHE IS AT THE BAR RIGHT
NOW ORDERING A LAGAVULIN, NEAT

178
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,465
FOR YOU. I MEAN,
SHE'S EVEN PUTTING UP

179
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:40,834
WITH ALL THIS STUPID,
BORING WOODWORKING STUFF.

180
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,804
I'M SORRY, BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT THE SUPER BOWL, GUYS.

181
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,205
LET'S TAKE IT DOWN
A NOTCH.

182
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,608
ANYWAY,
YOU HAVE MY APPROVAL.

183
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:48,642
- I DON'T NEED
YOUR APPROVAL.

184
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:49,743
- BUT YOU HAVE IT.
- DON'T NEED IT.

185
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,112
- BUT YOU GOT IT.

186
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,847
THIS COULD
END UP BEING

187
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,816
THE BEST NIGHT
IN RON SWANSON'S LIFE.

188
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,084
I AM SO, SO HAPPY
FOR HIM--

189
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,554
- HELLO,
YOU GORGEOUS CRAFTSMEN.

190
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,523
WOW,
LOOK AT THIS ROOM.

191
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,593
SO MUCH WOOD,
READY TO BE WORKED.

192
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,462
- [bleep] ME!

193
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,801
- HEY, HEY, ALERT.
ALERT. ALERT. ALERT.

194
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,168
- SHE'S HERE,
ISN'T SHE?

195
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,839
- OH, HEY, RON.
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

196
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,008
GOSH, I NEVER DREAMED
YOU'D BE HERE.

197
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,076
- TAMMY,
THIS IS DIANE.

198
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,580
DIANE, THIS IS A PIECE
OF HUMAN GARBAGE NAMED TAMMY,

199
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,715
WHO IS ALSO
MY EX-WIFE.

200
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:29,717
- TWICE EX-WIFE.
WE WERE MARRIED TWICE.

201
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:30,918
- AND DIVORCED TWICE.

202
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,986
EVERYTHING IS DONE.
THEY ARE TOTALLY DONE.

203
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,722
TAMMY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

204
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:38,526
- OH, I JUST HAVE A LITTLE
SOMETHING I NEED TO GET DRILLED.

205
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,227
- CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

206
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,229
EVERYTHING'S FINE,
WE'RE JUST GONNA CHAT.

207
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,866
SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT THE LIBRARY,
FORCING PEOPLE TO BORROW BOOKS?

208
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,000
- LESLIE,
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

209
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,569
THAT THE LIBRARY CLOSES
AT 3:00 P.M.

210
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,137
- OF COURSE IT DOES.

211
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,639
- BESIDES, I LIKE
TO KEEP TABS ON RON.

212
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,273
- SO YOU CAN RUIN
HIS LIFE?

213
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,508
- SO I CAN HAVE FUN
WITH HIM,

214
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,745
AND SOMETIMES RUINING HIS LIFE
CAN BE A PART OF THAT, SURE.

215
00:07:57,745 --> 00:07:59,613
- THIS MAY BE
THE HARDEST CHALLENGE YET

216
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,081
FOR LESLIE KNOPE,
EMOTIONAL GUARDIAN.

217
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,150
I NEED TO PROTECT
A SWEET COUPLE

218
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,118
FROM A SEX-CRAZED
DEMON LIBRARIAN

219
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,855
WHO MAKES ME QUESTION MY STANCE
ON USING THE "B" WORD.

220
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,289
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE JUST THIS ONCE.

221
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,259
NO, LESLIE, FIGHT IT.
FIGHT IT.

222
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,596
- [groans]
IT LOOKS WARM IN THERE!

223
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,797
WARM AND HAPPY.

224
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,232
- MM, LOOK AT
THAT GINGERBREAD MAN.

225
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,602
- WHAT? I DON'T SEE
ANY GINGERBREAD COOKIES.

226
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,270
- I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT
JACKED-UP, LIGHT-SKINNED DUDE.

227
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,638
LOOK LIKE
BLAKE GRIFFIN.

228
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,273
- [whispering]
YOU GUYS!

229
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,309
THERE'S A BUFFET--
IN THE HOUSE!

230
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,078
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU COULD DO THAT!

231
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,546
- WE NEED
TO CRASH THIS PARTY.

232
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:33,581
[knocking at window]

233
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:36,817
ANN, LET US IN.

234
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,886
- LET'S GO.

235
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,288
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

236
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,224
YOU WANT TO COME
INTO JERRY'S PARTY?

237
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,793
AND WHY IS THAT?

238
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:47,595
- I NEED A PLACE
TO DELIVER THIS BABY, ANN.

239
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:48,962
IT'S COMING OUT OF ME RIGHT NOW.
I'M PREGNANT.

240
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,264
[breathes rhythmically]
- THIS IS A LOVELY PARTY

241
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,234
THROWN BY A LOVELY MAN
AND HIS LOVELY FAMILY.

242
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,969
THERE'S NO PLACE
FOR MEANIES.

243
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,138
- AW, FORGET IT,
I'M COMING IN.

244
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,139
OW!

245
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,741
GET OFF ME.
- WAIT.

246
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,676
[laughs]
YOU'RE SO WEAK, REALLY?

247
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:03,744
- [groans]
- I MEAN,

248
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,145
I'M BARELY EVEN
DOING ANYTHING.

249
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,247
ARE YOU IRON-DEFICIENT?
LET ME LOOK AT YOUR PALM.

250
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,583
- OW. IT'S BECAUSE
OF YOUR MAN STRENGTH,

251
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,151
MAN PERKINS.

252
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,620
- LET US IN, ANN.

253
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,553
IT'S COLD OUTSIDE,
AND I CAN'T WEAR MITTENS

254
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,656
'CAUSE THEY'RE UNFLATTERING
TO MY HANDS.

255
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,625
- SORRY, GUYS.
THIS IS YOUR PENANCE.

256
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,827
YOU CAN COME IN IF YOU
DO SOMETHING NICE FOR JERRY.

257
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,962
- HEY, I ALREADY
DID SOMETHING NICE FOR JERRY.

258
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,297
I DROVE HERE
TO TAKE HIM TO JERRY DINNER.

259
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,667
- OH, DONNA.
YOU CAN COME IN.

260
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,500
- [gasps]
- OKAY.

261
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,435
- WHAT? WHAT ABOUT US?
- [snickers]

262
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,038
- WHAT? DONNA!
- MERRY CRITCHES, BITCHES!

263
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,706
- DONNA, DON'T LEAVE US!
DONNA?

264
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,007
- OH, WELL, WHATEVER.

265
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,243
IT'S JERRY'S PARTY.
HOW COOL COULD IT BE?

266
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,645
[gasps]
SANTA!

267
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,012
THEY HAVE A SANTA!
- OH, MY GOD.

268
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,280
- WHAT?
- AW!

269
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,685
- WELCOME TO THE INDIANA FINE
WOODWORKING ASSOCIATION AWARDS.

270
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,087
[cheers and applause]

271
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,056
I'M YOUR HOST,
MARTIN HOUSELY,

272
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,257
AND WOW,
IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT SHOW--

273
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,258
KNOCK ON WOOD.

274
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,293
[laughter]

275
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,696
- THAT'S GOOD.
- OH, MY GOSH.

276
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,698
WHAT A COINKY-DINKY. LOOK,
WE'RE SITTING AT THE SAME TABLE!

277
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,400
- TAMMY,
THIS TABLE IS RESERVED.

278
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,770
- A GUY TRADED ME HIS SEAT
FOR A PEEK AND A SQUEEZE.

279
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,772
THAT'S MY BOOB AND MY BUTT,
RESPECTIVELY.

280
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,807
REMEMBER THAT, RON?

281
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,041
- SUBTLE.

282
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,843
- WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY ASKED ME
IF I WOULD HOST THIS EVENT,

283
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:13,847
AND I SAID, "WOULD I?"
[laughter]

284
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,849
- BEN, COME MEET
JERRY'S WIFE.

285
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,317
GAYLE?

286
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:22,355
- HAPPY HOLIDAYS, CHRIS.

287
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,290
I HAVE SOMEONE
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET.

288
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,059
- I'M GAYLE GERGICH.

289
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,296
- GAYLE--
YOU'RE GAYLE?

290
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,931
JERRY'S
BEAUTIFUL WIFE...

291
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,366
- OH.
- WHO LOOKS LIKE THAT.

292
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,868
- [chuckles]
- GAYLE, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT

293
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,970
IN ANY WAY UNCOMFORTABLE
THAT I'M HERE,

294
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,007
SINCE I DATED YOUR DAUGHTER.
- OH, NOT AT ALL.

295
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,042
YOU'RE WELCOME HERE
ANY TIME.

296
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:45,145
OOPS, THERE'S A LITTLE HAIR
ON YOUR SHOULDER.

297
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,346
- OH.

298
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:50,217
- WELL, LOOK WHO'S A SILVER FOX.
- [laughs]

299
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,953
WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT?

300
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,888
- I'M SORRY,
YOU'RE OKAY?

301
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,090
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE
YOUR BODY IS IN DECAY

302
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,358
OR DEATH
IS INEVITABLE?

303
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:02,395
- MY, MY. SOMEBODY'S
BEING A GLOOMY GOOSE.

304
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:06,133
- YEAH.
RELAX, GLOOMY GOOSE.

305
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:10,470
- WELCOME, EVERYBODY,
TO ANOTHER GERGICH CHRISTMAS.

306
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,073
- SADLY, ONE OF OUR
THREE BEAUTIFUL ANGELS,

307
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,407
MILLICENT,
COULDN'T BE HERE TONIGHT,

308
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,344
BUT OUR OTHER TWO BEAUTIES--
MIRIAM AND GLADYS--

309
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,347
ARE GOING TO HELP GAYLE
AND ME PLAY A LITTLE TUNE.

310
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,716
[piano intro]

311
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:27,254
* HERE WE GO A-CAROLING,
AMONG THE LEAVES SO GREEN *

312
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,724

SO FAIR TO BE SEEN *

313
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,926

314
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,295
* AND TO YOU

317
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,741
[cheers and applause]

318
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,109
- I'M GOING TO
CALL A CAB.

319
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,111
- WHY DOES EVERYONE ACT
LIKE JERRY'S THE VICTIM HERE?

320
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,312
HE'S THE ONE
THAT DIDN'T INVITE US

321
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,447
TO HIS CHRISTMAS PARTY.
[gasps]

322
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,950
JERRY FILTER!
- JERRY FILTER!

323
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,418
- WHO'S JERRY FILTER?

324
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,221
- UNSURPRISINGLY, JERRY SENDS
A LOT OF ANNOYING EMAILS.

325
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,791
SO A WHILE AGO, I PUT
A FILTER ON ALL OUR ACCOUNTS.

326
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,259
EVERYTHING FROM JERRY
GOES DIRECTLY TO SPAM.

327
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,296
A-A-AND...

328
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,799
HERE'S OUR INVITATION.

329
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,001
- THERE'S THREE YEARS
OF NICE MESSAGES ON HERE.

330
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,368
"CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR WEDDING.

331
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,504
I'M ROOTING FOR YOU KIDS.
JERRY."

332
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,206
- "HOPE YOU HAVE
THE BEST BIRTHDAY, TOM."

333
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:22,275
- I JUST TIED MY HIGH SCORE
IN SNAKE.

334
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:28,048
- OUR NEXT AWARD
IS FOR "ACHIEVEMENT IN CHAIRS."

335
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:31,351
THE NOMINEES ARE:
ASA CHRISTIANA FOR CHAIR,

336
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,353
RON SWANSON FOR CHAIR,
H.W. DAVENPORT FOR CHAIR.

337
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:36,156
- SO EXCITING, RON.

338
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,425
- OKAY, RON,
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT.

339
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,293
TUNE HER OUT.
SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE.

340
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,162
- AND THE WINNER IS...

341
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,964
RON SWANSON FOR CHAIR.

342
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:47,000
- OH, WOW! WHOO!

343
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,138
[applause]

344
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:59,146
- THIS AWARD IS THE ONLY ONE
I'D EVER GIVE A DAMN ABOUT.

345
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,516
I MADE MY FIRST CHAIR
WHEN I WAS FIVE,

346
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,819
BUT THE QUALITY OF THE WOOD
WAS WANTING,

347
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,588
SO WHEN I TURNED NINE,
I USED MY FACTORY WAGES

348
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,791
TO PURCHASE
SOME BEAUTIFUL LOCAL WALNUT.

349
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,930
UH, THANK YOU...
FOR THIS...

350
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,067
UH, THIS ALL GOOD--
NIGHT GOOD.

351
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,469
UH...

352
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,537
THERE IT IS.

353
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:29,576
[hesitant applause]

354
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,280
- HEY, YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A PICTURE OF MILLIE.

355
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,415
YOU WANT TO TAKE OFF,
GRAB SOME VEGAN FRIES?

356
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,450
- SHE REALLY
WAS DELIGHTFUL.

357
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,386
I TRULY WISH HER
ALL THE BEST.

358
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:43,223
- MAN, MAYBE GOING TO THERAPY
1,000 TIMES A WEEK IS HELPING.

359
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,992
I MEAN, IF YOU'D SEEN
THAT PICTURE A MONTH AGO,

360
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,193
YOU WOULD HAVE
FALLEN APART.

361
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,261
- [chuckles]
IT'S JUST A PICTURE.

362
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,963
- MILLIE!
- HI, MOM!

363
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,431
both: [giggling]

364
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,466
- WE WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU
AND COME HOME EARLY.

365
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,567
- [giggles]

366
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,536
OH, HEY, CHRIS.

367
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,306
- HI.

368
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,474
- LET'S TAKE A MOMENT NOW
TO REMEMBER

369
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,877
THOSE WOODWORKERS
WHO ARE NO LONGER WITH US,

370
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:07,280
AND THE BEAUTIFUL COFFINS
THEY ALL DESIGNED THEMSELVES.

371
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,018
[sad piano music]

372
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,019
- HEY.

373
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,286
- HEY.
- HAVE YOU SEEN RON?

374
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,156
HE DISAPPEARED AFTER THE SPEECH
AND I CAN'T FIND HIM ANYWHERE.

375
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,458
- DIANE--UGH.
THE STUFF WITH TAMMY

376
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,028
IS SO COMPLEX AND WEIRD
AND GROSS.

377
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,296
IT JUST WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER
IF YOU LET ME HANDLE IT.

378
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,998
- I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT TAMMY.

379
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,167
I MEAN, I'M A MIDDLE SCHOOL
VICE-PRINCIPAL.

380
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,469
I DEAL WITH HORMONAL PSYCHOPATHS
ALL THE TIME.

381
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,938
- OH, GREAT. GOOD.

382
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:33,306
- WHAT CONCERNS ME IS YOU.
- YOU WHO?

383
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,142
- YOU YOU.
- YOU ME?

384
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:36,476
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S BEEN
AT HIS SIDE ALL NIGHT.

385
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,011
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S BEEN PROTECTING HIM,

386
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,980
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO KNOWS
ALL THE INTIMATE DETAILS

387
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,581
OF HIS ROMANTIC HISTORY
WITH THAT MONSTER.

388
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,683
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
DIANE, YOU MISUNDERSTAND.

389
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,452
I'M HAPPILY ENGAGED.

390
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,421
- YOU AND RON HAVE AN INTIMACY
THAT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND,

391
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,623
SO IF THERE IS A THREAT
TO MY RELATIONSHIP WITH RON,

392
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,261
IT'S NOT TAMMY.
IT'S YOU.

393
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,429
- OKAY, FOLKS,
FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS.

394
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,266
IT'S THE BIG ONE:
BEST DESK.

395
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,600
[applause]

396
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,571
- WHERE'S DIANE?
I NEED HER.

397
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,039
- SHE LEFT.
- OF COURSE.

398
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,274
TAMMY RUINS EVERYTHING.

399
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,641
- NO, SHE LEFT
BECAUSE OF ME.

400
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,411
SHE'S THREATENED
BY OUR RELATIONSHIP.

401
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,246
- [laughs]

402
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,681
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

403
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,217
I DON'T THINK OF YOU
ROMANTICALLY.

404
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,552
YOU'RE PRO-GOVERNMENT,
YOU NEVER STOP TALKING,

405
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,654
AND YOU HAVE BLONDE HAIR.
YOU'RE MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

406
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,623
- EXCUSE ME,
ONE MAN'S "WORST NIGHTMARE"

407
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,526
IS EVERY OTHER MAN'S
"TOTAL PACKAGE."

408
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,495
BUT THE POINT IS,
I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT DATING.

409
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,630
I KIND OF SEE
WHERE DIANE IS COMING FROM.

410
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,600
WE ARE CLOSE FRIENDS, AND
I'M VERY INVOLVED IN YOUR LIFE.

411
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,068
- I WOULDN'T SAY
WE'RE CLOSE.

412
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,037
- BY SWANSON STANDARDS,
WE'RE CLOSE.

413
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,205
I KNOW
WHEN YOUR BIRTHDAY IS.

414
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,672
- SO DOES
BASKIN-ROBBINS.

415
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,641
- I KNOW THAT YOU
SECRETLY LOVE ARTICHOKES

416
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,011
AND PLUMS.
- KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN, WOMAN!

417
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,747
FINE, WE'RE FRIENDS.
SO WHAT DO I DO?

418
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,649
TAMMY'S WAITING FOR ME
IN MY CAR.

419
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,719
- I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE MY CAR
AND GO GET DIANE,

420
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,355
AND I WILL
HANDLE TAMMY.

421
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:56,589
- THANK YOU.

422
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,724
PROTECT YOUR EYES,
SHE'S A GOUGER.

423
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,226
- GOOD TO KNOW.

424
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,561
- CHRIS, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET MY FIANCE, CARL.

425
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,430
- WELL.
- HI, THERE.

426
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,498
- HI.
HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?

427
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,333
- WHITEWATER RAFTING.

428
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,368
- HE WAS
THE YOUNG RAFTING INSTRUCTOR

429
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,636
ALL THE GIRLS
WERE INTO,

430
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,171
AND I WAS
THE YOUNG RAFTING INSTRUCTOR

431
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,305
ALL THE GUYS WERE INTO...
- [laughs]

432
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,041
AND THEN WE GOT TOGETHER.
[laughs]

433
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,708
- AH, SO RANDOM,
RIGHT?

434
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,778
- WHAT A STORY! I FELT LIKE
MY HEART WAS WHITEWATER RAFTING.

435
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,580
[laughter]
- WELL, I WON'T KEEP YOU GUYS.

436
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,082
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
MWAH.

437
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,484
OH, LITTLE TIP,
THERE IS FAT IN THE EGG NOG.

438
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,618
- OKAY.
[chuckles]

439
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,421
- SO HOW'D IT GO?
YOU OKAY?

440
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,722
- [sighs]

441
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,391
I'M FINE.

442
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,725
IF THERAPY
HAS TAUGHT ME ANYTHING,

443
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,727
IT'S THAT I NEED
TO FACE MY FEARS,

444
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,430
EVEN WHEN MY FEARS
ARE ENGAGED TO A MAN

445
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,167
WITH THE CHISELED JAWLINE
OF A YOUNG ME.

446
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,601
THANK YOU, BEN.

447
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,569
- THANK ME?
FOR WHAT?

448
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,771
- FOR LOOKING OUT FOR ME
TONIGHT.

449
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,506
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND.

450
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,042
- HEY...

451
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,610
SO GAYLE AND JERRY--

452
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,580
- I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT A LOT.
THERE'S NO LOGICAL EXPLANATION.

453
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,816
- [chuckles]

454
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,651
WELL, HELLO THERE,
BIG B--

455
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:02,322
GROSS! LESLIE?
WHERE'S RON?

456
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,790
- TOO LATE, TAMMY.
RON'S GONE.

457
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,292
- [scoffs]
- YOU'LL NEVER GET HIM BACK.

458
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:08,061
- WANNA BET?
THAT RELATIONSHIP IS WEAK.

459
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:11,498
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS FIND RON
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS,

460
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:12,765
AND HE'S TOAST.

461
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,635
- FEW HOURS, YOU SAY?

462
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:16,703
- LESLIE!

463
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,405
STOP THIS CAR!
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

464
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:19,706
- I DON'T KNOW.

465
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,808
- YOU'RE GONNA
REGRET THIS!

466
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,411
- WELL, HELLO AGAIN.

467
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,446
YOU READY
TO BE NICE TO JERRY?

468
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,681
BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD
OUT HERE,

469
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,583
IT REMINDS ME
OF MY WIFE'S LASAGNA.

470
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,652
- I ACTUALLY
LIKE THAT ONE.

471
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,088
- HEY, GUYS!
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T COMING.

472
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,224
I--YOU KNOW,
NEVER GOT YOUR RSVP.

473
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:40,560
- HI, JERRY. WE GOT YOU A GIFT.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

474
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,661
- YEAH, JUST--

475
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,663
WE TOOK UP A COLLECTION
TO PAY YOUR HOSPITAL BILLS,

476
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,733
SINCE YOU ALMOST
FARTED YOURSELF TO DEATH.

477
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,168
- EVERY TIME
WE DID SOMETHING MEAN,

478
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,836
WE PUT A DOLLAR
IN A BOX.

479
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,805
- WOW. I'M THE LUCKIEST MAN
ON EARTH.

480
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,642
OKAY, WELL, COME ON IN!
IT'S A PARTY.

481
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:03,683
UH--
OH, JEEZ.

482
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,286
- GIVE ME THE KEYS!
- NO!

483
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,521
- GIVE 'EM TO ME!
- NEVER!

484
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,590
HEY,
GAME OVER, TAMMY.

485
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,360
- WHAT? YOU--!
- AH!

486
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,827
- I'M GOING IN!

487
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,129
[screams]

488
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:19,866
[both struggling]

489
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,435
OH, MY GOD,
I AM SO TURNED ON RIGHT NOW.

490
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,803
- WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU?

491
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,638
- OH, YEAH, TELL ME
YOU'RE NOT FEELING THIS.

492
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,140
- YOU ARE SO CRAZY!

493
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,408
- I GOT 'EM!

494
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:29,476
I GOT 'EM.
- NO!

495
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:30,710
[both struggling]

496
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,145
- NO!
- AH!

497
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,313
- THEY'LL NEVER CATCH ME!

498
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,747
- COME BACK HERE--OW!

499
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:35,915
- [cackles]
- YOU ARE NOT

500
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,184
GONNA RUIN THIS NIGHT!

501
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:38,651
GET AWAY FROM THIS CAR!
- NO!

502
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,553
- [screams]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

503
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:41,721
YOU'RE CRAZY!

504
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,624
RON! RON!
- HA!

505
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,625
YOU'RE TOO LATE!

506
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,593
- [yells]
- [starts]

507
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,729
- [humming]
- NO! NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

508
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:54,501
- SHE JUST KNOWS YOU SO WELL,
AND I WAS STARTING TO WONDER

509
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,303
IF I WAS EVER
GONNA GET TO THAT POINT.

510
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,338
I'M WORRIED
THAT MAYBE

511
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,540
THERE ISN'T ROOM IN YOUR LIFE
FOR ANOTHER WOMAN.

512
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,510
- AT THIS VERY MOMENT,
LESLIE IS THROWING HERSELF

513
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,580
IN FRONT OF A FREIGHT TRAIN
NAMED TAMMY FOR ME AND YOU.

514
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,949
LESLIE IS A WONDERFUL,
LOYAL FRIEND,

515
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,884
WHO IS VERY IMPORTANT
IN MY LIFE,

516
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,387
BUT I WOULD SOONER
VISIT EUROPE

517
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,789
THAN HAVE SOMETHING ROMANTIC
HAPPEN BETWEEN US.

518
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:20,460
ALTHOUGH,
IF YOU'D LIKE TO VISIT EUROPE,

519
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,729
I LIKE YOU SO MUCH,
I'D BE WILLING TO RISK IT.

520
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:25,732
- BUT NOT FRANCE,
RIGHT?

521
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:26,766
- GOD, NO.

522
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,768
- [laughs]

523
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,438
- SEE? YOU KNOW ME
PRETTY WELL ALREADY,

524
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:34,574
BUT YOU'RE ABOUT TO
GET TO KNOW ME EVEN BETTER.

525
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,244
I BROUGHT YOU HERE BECAUSE
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING

526
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:38,878
THAT ALMOST NO ONE
KNOWS ABOUT--

527
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:42,649
CERTAINLY NOT TAMMY,
AND NOT EVEN LESLIE KNOPE.

528
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:46,219
- LADIES AND GENTLEMAN,
AND ESPECIALLY THE LADIES,

529
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:49,389
PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER
FOR THE ONE, THE ONLY,

530
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,459
MY MAN,
MR. DUKE SILVER.

531
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:56,363
[cheers and applause]

532
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,998
- A MIGHTY FINE HOLIDAY EVENING
TO YOU ALL.

533
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,435
- YEAH.
- IT MIGHT BE COLD OUTSIDE,

534
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,772
BUT IT'S ABOUT TO GET WARM
ALL UP IN MY JAZZ.

535
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:06,773
[laughter]

536
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,641
I, OF COURSE,
AM DUKE SILVER,

537
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,611
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO DEDICATE THIS FIRST SONG...

538
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:12,779
TO MY DUCHESS.

539
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,948
[jazzy version of
Hark! The Herald Angels Sing]

540
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,485
*

541
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:20,553
- YOU'RE SO LUCKY.

542
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,824
- I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

543
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:30,630
*

544
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,466
- I THINK IT'S TIME
TO OFFICIALLY RETIRE

545
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,469
AS RON'S EMOTIONAL GUARDIAN.
THAT'S DIANE'S JOB NOW,

546
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,671
AND SHE SEEMS
MORE THAN UP TO THE TASK.

547
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,574
I MEAN,
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR RON--

548
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,844
EVEN SPEND A WHOLE NIGHT
FIGHTING HIS CRAZY EX-WIFE.

549
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:48,848
BUT I THINK I'M SAFE.
SHE'S GOTTA BE TIRED BY NOW.

550
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:49,916
- HI.
- [screams]

551
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:53,953
- OFFICER SKORGGEL.
- I PULLED HER OVER

552
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,856
A TAMMY SWANSON
FOR DRIVING ERRATICALLY.

553
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,758
RAN THE PLATES,
SAW IT WAS YOUR CAR.

554
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,427
FIGURED
IT WAS STOLEN.

555
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,795
- HEY, RON, WHY DON'T YOU
GET ME OUT OF THESE HANDCUFFS,

556
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:05,298
SO I CAN PUT YOU
INTO THESE HANDCUFFS.

557
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,400
- YES, AND OFFICER, WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE OFF THOSE HANDCUFFS?

558
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,935
I WANT THIS
TO BE A FAIR FIGHT.

559
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,639
- OFFICER, DID YOU SEE
ANY SIGN OF A PASSENGER?

560
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,741
[thumping from trunk]
- RON!

561
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:15,908
- THERE WE GO.

562
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,977
- HEY!
[thumping]

563
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,648
HELP.
