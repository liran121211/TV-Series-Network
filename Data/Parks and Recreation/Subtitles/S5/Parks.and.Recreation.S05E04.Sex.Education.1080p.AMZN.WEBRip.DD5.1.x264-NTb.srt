00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:02,573
- MR. HAVERFORD,
ON THE MORNING OF YOUR CRASH,

2
00:00:02,573 --> 00:00:04,343
WERE YOU ALONE IN YOUR CAR?
- YES.

3
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:06,081
YOUR HONOR, THIS WAS
AN ACCIDENT, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

4
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:07,383
I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS
IN YOUR MOUTH,

5
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:09,219
BUT "CASE DISMISSED."

6
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:10,656
- YOU WERE TEXTING
AT THE TIME, CORRECT?

7
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:13,262
- HOW DARE YOU, SIR!
I WAS TWEETING.

8
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:14,430
- PLEASE READ
EXHIBIT "C,"

YOU HAVE A PROBLEM

23
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:49,200
KEEPING YOUR EYES
ON THE ROAD

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,304
AND OFF
YOUR ELECTRONIC DEVICES.

25
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:53,641
I'M GOING TO TAILOR
A PUNISHMENT TO FIT THE CRIME.

26
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:55,578
ONE WEEK WITHOUT SCREENS.

27
00:00:55,578 --> 00:00:59,387
NO PHONE, TABLETS,
COMPUTERS, TELEVISION--ANYTHING.

28
00:00:59,387 --> 00:01:00,121
- NO! PLEASE,
SEND ME TO JAIL!

29
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:03,261
- ANY SLIPUPS,
AND THAT WEEK BECOMES A MONTH.

30
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:04,463
TURN IN YOUR PHONE,
PLEASE.

36
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,751
- HOWDY.

37
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:33,621
- HEY!
WHAT'S WITH THE GET-UP?

38
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:35,426
- I JUST GOT BACK FROM
THAT DUDE RANCH WITH RICKY.

39
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:37,463
IT WAS REALLY FUN.
HE BOUGHT THIS FOR ME AS A GIFT.

40
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:39,867
- A COWBOY HAT
FROM YOUR COWBOYFRIEND.

41
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,404
OH, THAT MAKES IT SOUND
LIKE HE'S A COW.

42
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:43,842
FROM YOUR COWBOY BOYFRIEND.
YOUR BOYCOW-COWBOY.

43
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:45,645
- JUST CALL HIM "RICKY."
- OKAY, GREAT.

44
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:47,850
OKAY, EVERYONE.

45
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,588
GREAT NEWS: LOTS OF OLD PEOPLE
HAVE CHLAMYDIA.

46
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:51,724
- WHOO!

47
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:54,330
- SENIORS IN PAWNEE HAVE
A LOT OF TIME ON THEIR HANDS,

48
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,665
AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING
WITH THAT TIME

49
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:58,037
IS GOING AT IT HARD,
OLD PEOPLE-STYLE.

50
00:01:58,037 --> 00:02:00,241
A LOT OF THEM HAVEN'T
HAD PROPER SEX EDUCATION,

51
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:03,448
AND AS A RESULT,
STDs ARE HAVING A FIELD DAY.

52
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:05,952
IT'S AMAZING
WHAT A FEW OLD GUYS CAN DO

53
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,492
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CHARM
AND A LOT OF CRABS.

54
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:10,061
OKAY, SEX AVENGERS,

55
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:12,500
THESE OLD FOGIES
ARE VERY SET IN THEIR WAYS.

56
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,402
THEY'RE HOPPED UP
ON E.D. MEDICATION

57
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:15,873
AND THEY GOT
NOTHING TO LOSE,

58
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:16,975
'CAUSE
THEY'RE CLOSE TO DEATH.

59
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:19,514
- ALSO, SENIORS
CAN BE PRETTY ORNERY.

60
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,985
- UH, ACTUALLY, I THINK
IT'S PRONOUNCED "HORNY."

61
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:24,657
- I HAVE AN IDEA. LET'S PRETEND
THAT WE'RE OLD PEOPLE,

62
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:27,329
AND WE CAN ASK ANN
OUR GROSSEST,

63
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:28,965
MOST PERVERTED
SEX QUESTIONS.

64
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:30,635
I'LL START.
I'M AN OLD LADY,

65
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:32,640
WHY DO I NEED
BIRTH CONTROL?

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,778
I HAVEN'T HAD MY MONTHLY
SINCE LBJ WAS PRESIDENT.

67
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:36,648
- WELL, WITH THE ELDERLY,

68
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,818
WE ARE NOT SO CONCERNED
WITH PREGNANCY.

69
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:40,621
WE'RE MORE CONCERNED
WITH DISEASE.

70
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,027
- DO PUBIC HAIRS GET LONGER
THE OLDER YOU GET?

71
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:44,062
- I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

72
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:45,899
- BECAUSE
THAT'S HAPPENING TO ME.

73
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,503
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

74
00:02:47,503 --> 00:02:49,005
- WHERE CAN I GET LUBE
THAT IS HEALTHY TO EAT?

75
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:52,379
- I RAN OVER MY TESTICLES
WITH MY JAZZY SCOOTER.

76
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:53,315
- I THINK YOU'RE
GOOD TO GO, NURSEY.

77
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:55,485
I WANT TO JUMP ON THAT CABOOSE.
CHOO CHOO!

78
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:57,489
- YOU SHOULD NEVER EAT LUBE,

79
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:58,558
YOU NEED TO SEE
A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY,

80
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:00,361
AND I'M SORRY, SIR,
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE UNDER 40

81
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:02,499
TO RIDE THIS TRAIN.

82
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:04,437
- OH!
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT, KIDS.

83
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:05,439
- [laughs]
- NICE.

84
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,177
- "LE-RON JAMES."
WE STILL ON FOR BREAKFAST?

85
00:03:08,177 --> 00:03:10,481
- YOU ARE AN HOUR AND A HALF
LATE FOR WORK.

86
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,719
- YEAH. SORRY.
I CAN'T USE MY GPS,

87
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,989
BUT I FIGURED IT OUT.

88
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,793
I JUST DROVE AROUND IN CIRCLES
UNTIL I SAW SOMETHING FAMILIAR.

89
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:18,431
- YOU LIVE 3 MILES
FROM HERE.

90
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,836
- 3.4,
ACCORDING TO MY GPS,

91
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:22,038
WHICH I USED TO USE
EVERY DAY.

92
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:23,575
I CAN'T USE SCREENS
FOR A WEEK.

93
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:25,579
BIG DEAL!
I'M ADAPTING.

94
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,652
I BUILT A REAL-LIFE
PINTEREST BOARD.

95
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:34,095
I REALLY WISH
YOU COULD CLICK THOSE.

96
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:36,634
- WOW, THERE HE IS,
BARACK OBAMA.

97
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:37,770
- HIS NAME
IS CONGRESSMAN DAVID MURRAY,

98
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,741
HE IS OUR BOSS
AND HE IS WHITE.

99
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:41,944
DON'T EMBARRASS ME.

100
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:43,515
CONGRESSMAN MURRAY,
I'M BEN WYATT,

101
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,552
COORDINATING DIRECTOR
OF D.C. OPERATIONS.

102
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:47,221
- AND I AM APRIL BLART,
MALL COP.

103
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:49,794
- GREAT! IT'S A PLEASURE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU, BEN.

104
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:51,497
HEARD SUCH GREAT THINGS.

105
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,999
- OH, WELL, I REALLY FEEL
LIKE I KNOW YOU ALREADY.

106
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,137
I'VE WATCHED ALL
OF YOUR SPEECHES AND DEBATES.

107
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:56,274
IT'S VERY INSPIRING.

108
00:03:56,274 --> 00:03:57,743
- THANK YOU, BEN.

109
00:03:57,743 --> 00:04:00,047
AND THANK YOU ALL
FOR YOUR HARD WORK.

110
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:02,986
NOW, STAY COOL.
IT'S A HOT ONE OUT THERE TODAY.

111
00:04:02,986 --> 00:04:04,089
- [laughs]
- THAT'S RIGHT,

112
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:06,025
YOU COULD PRACTICALLY
COOK AN EGG ON THE SIDEWALK.

113
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:09,032
- [chuckles]
TERRIFIC.

114
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,770
- OKAY,
LET'S MAKE SURE WE'RE READY

115
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,040
FOR THE STRATEGY SESSION
TOMORROW.

116
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,577
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

117
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:16,814
- HEY, WE'RE STILL
GONNA ASSASSINATE HIM, RIGHT?

118
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:19,652
- DON'T SAY THAT.
- BEN!

119
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:27,668
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING?

120
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,275
- HELLO,
CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME OKAY?

121
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:31,277
all: NO.

122
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:33,281
- OKAY, GREAT.
I'M COUNCILWOMAN LESLIE KNOPE,

123
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:35,918
AND TODAY WE ARE HERE
TO TALK ABOUT SAFE SEX.

124
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:37,955
I KNOW THIS IS
A PERSONAL QUESTION,

125
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:40,729
BUT HOW MANY OF YOU OUT THERE
ARE SEXUALLY ACTIVE?

126
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:41,731
OH, MY.

127
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,637
- I HAVE TWO PARTNERS,
OFTEN AT THE SAME TIME.

128
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:46,105
- WOW. THANK YOU.

129
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:48,176
DOES ANYONE KNOW
WHAT WE RISK

130
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:50,247
WHEN WE HAVE
UNPROTECTED SEX?

131
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:51,851
- HEART ATTACK.
- FALLING IN LOVE.

132
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,688
- PARTNER DIES
ON TOP OF YOU!

133
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:55,325
- YES,
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

134
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:57,094
THE GREATEST RISK YOU FACE

135
00:04:57,094 --> 00:04:59,064
IS SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED
DISEASES.

136
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:00,601
- ARE THESE OLD PEOPLE REALLY
HAVING SEX WITH EACH OTHER?

137
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,940
- YEAH, WHAT'D YOU THINK
THEY WERE DOING?

138
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,343
- I DON'T KNOW,
I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST

139
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:05,879
TALKING ABOUT IT.

140
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,654
OH!
[disgusted laugh]

141
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:12,926
- AND THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT
THEM IS TO USE PROTECTION.

142
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:14,330
- WELL, THAT'S
ALL FINE AND GOOD,

143
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,100
BUT WHAT IF THE BANANA
IS SOFT AND MUSHY,

144
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,238
AND DOGLEGS
SHARPLY TO THE LEFT?

145
00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:21,309
- [shudders]

146
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,323
- OH, MY GOD, JERRY,
WHEN YOU CHECK YOUR EMAIL,

147
00:05:28,323 --> 00:05:31,262
YOU GO TO ALTAVISTA AND TYPE
"PLEASE GO TO YAHOO.COM?"

148
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:32,366
- WELL,
HOW ELSE WOULD I DO IT?

149
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,868
- YOU DON'T HAVE
YOUR EMAIL BOOKMARKED?

150
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:35,004
DO YOU HAVE ANY BOOKMARKS?

151
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:36,440
- WHAT'S BOOKMARKS?

152
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,178
- GOD, JERRY!
YOU DON'T DESERVE THE INTERNET!

153
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:40,247
I'M GOING CRAZY, RON!

154
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:41,450
LIFE WITHOUT SCREENS
IS POINTLESS.

155
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,190
I MADE AN iPHONE OUT OF PAPER.
IT'S NOT THE SAME, THOUGH.

156
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,200
- THIS IS THE WORK
OF A LUNATIC.

157
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,170
YOU NEED TO DETOX.

158
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,410
TOMORROW, WE'LL GO
TO MY CABIN IN THE WOODS.

159
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,447
IT'S SO FAR AWAY
FROM CIVILIZATION,

160
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:58,149
THE ELECTRIC COMPANY
IS NOT EVEN AWARE

161
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,285
THERE'S A STRUCTURE THERE.

162
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:00,721
- [sighs]
THANKS, RON.

163
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:03,461
AND HEY, CAN YOU GIVE ME
A RIDE AFTER WORK?

164
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:07,101
THERE'S NO CHANCE
I CAN FIND MY WAY HOME.

165
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,939
- IF YOU ENCOUNTER
THIS SCENARIO,

166
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,511
SIMPLY EXECUTE
THE FOLLOWING MANEUVER.

167
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:15,150
- AND STOP!

168
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,886
GREAT JOB,
AND VERY INFORMATIVE,

169
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:18,557
BUT WE NEED
TO STOP NOW FOREVER

170
00:06:18,557 --> 00:06:19,460
AND PRETEND LIKE THIS
NEVER HAPPENED.

171
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,527
- WHY?
WHAT HAPPENING?

172
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:23,200
- [mumbles incoherently]

173
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,535
- OH, BOY.

174
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:26,407
MARCIA AND MARSHALL LANGMAN

175
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:28,309
ARE THE TOWN'S
MORALITY WATCHDOGS.

176
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:31,517
MARCIA IS MOTIVATED,
CALCULATING, AND HYPER-VIGILANT,

177
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:34,590
AND HER HUSBAND,
MARSHALL, IS...

178
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,059
VIVACIOUS.

179
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:39,600
- THIS, THAT'S HAPPENING HERE,
IS NOT ALLOWED!

180
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,205
- WE AT THE SOCIETY
FOR FAMILY STABILITY FOUNDATION

181
00:06:43,205 --> 00:06:45,879
OBJECT TO THIS SMUT
BEING TAUGHT.

182
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,449
IT'S AGAINST PAWNEE'S

183
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,219
ABSTINENCE-ONLY
SEX EDUCATION LAW.

184
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:51,590
- THAT'S ONLY FOR SCHOOLS.

185
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,461
- ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT.
THE WAY THE BILL IS DRAFTED

186
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:55,363
PROHIBITS
ANY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE

187
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:58,571
FROM TEACHING ANYTHING
BUT ABSTINENCE, CITY-WIDE.

188
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:00,206
- THANK YOU, CHRIS.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

189
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:03,145
- IF WE ALLOW THIS FILTH
TO BE TAUGHT TO OUR SENIORS,

190
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:04,949
THE NEXT YOU THING YOU KNOW,
IT'LL BE IN OUR HIGH SCHOOLS,

191
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:06,654
THEN OUR KINDERGARTENS,
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

192
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:08,357
WE HAVE BABIES
IN THONG UNDERWEAR.

193
00:07:08,357 --> 00:07:09,358
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

194
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:10,495
- YES,
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

195
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:13,468
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS VULGAR SEX SHOW IS OVER.

196
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,904
PLEASE FORGET EVERYTHING THIS
HORRIBLE WOMAN HAS TOLD YOU.

197
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:20,346
- IT IS NOT OVER.
IT IS FAR FROM OVER.

198
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:23,419
ANDY,
PACK UP OUR BANANAS!

199
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,099
- THIS WAS A GREAT IDEA.

200
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,403
FRESH AIR, NO SCREENS.

201
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:34,441
I'M GETTING REALLY GOOD
AT CHOPPING WOOD TOO.

202
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:36,146
- YOU'RE
A REGULAR PAUL BUNYAN.

203
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:38,016
- OW!
I GOT STUNG BY THE WOOD!

204
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:39,317
OH, NO,
IT'S A SPLINTER.

205
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:40,521
I NEED
TO GET ON WEBMD NOW!

206
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:42,357
I NEED A iPHONE
OR A SAMSUNG GALAXY,

207
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:43,459
SOMETHING WITH 4G.

208
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,063
THERE'S NO TIME
FOR THE EDGE NETWORK.

209
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:46,667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHA--? W-W-WAA!

210
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,105
- GOT IT.

211
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:50,642
- I STILL THINK
WE SHOULD FIND A COMPUTER

212
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,612
AND GOOGLE
"STERILIZATION TECHNIQUES."

213
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:53,815
- YEAH,
I HAVE A NEW IDEA.

214
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:56,687
YOU NEED TO PURGE ALL OF THIS
GARBAGE FROM YOUR SYSTEM.

215
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:59,158
TALK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS
YOU DO ON THOSE SCREENS,

216
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:00,961
AND LET THE WORDS JUST
FLOAT AWAY INTO THE FRESH AIR,

217
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:04,367
AND THEN WE WILL BE DONE.
- OKAY, WORTH A SHOT.

218
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,374
EVERY DAY I START BY HITTING UP
FACEBOOK, TWITTER,

219
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:08,510
TUMBLR, AND INSTAGRAM.

220
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,515
SOMETIMES I LIKE
TO THROW IN LINKEDIN,

221
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:12,719
FOR THE PROFESSIONAL
SHORTIES.

222
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:14,421
- SEE?
THAT WAS EASY.

223
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,124
- THEN I LIKE
TO GO ON REDDIT.

224
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:17,361
REDDIT'S GREAT,
'CAUSE IT HAS

225
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:19,432
ALL THE IMPORTANT LINKS
YOU NEED.

226
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,403
- NEW SHIRT?
- YEAH.

227
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:24,775
I GOT IT AT THE DUDE RANCH
WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

228
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:27,381
YOU LIKE IT?
- IT'S NOT MY FAVORITE SHIRT,

229
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,722
BUT IT IS
MY LEAST FAVORITE SHIRT.

230
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:32,290
- PERD,
WE STRONGLY BELIEVE

231
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,832
IN TEACHING
AND PRACTICING ABSTINENCE.

232
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:39,138
- WE ALL HAVE SOME CRAZY URGES
FROM TIME TO TIME,

233
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:40,140
BUT YOU JUST CAN'T
ACT ON THEM.

234
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,280
YOU HAVE TO BURY THEM
WAY DOWN DEEP INSIDE.

235
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,252
YOU HAVE TO SAY, "GET OUT
OF HERE, YOU CRAZY URGES!

236
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:47,789
YOU ARE NOT WELCOME
IN THIS BRAIN OF MINE!"

237
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:49,457
- THERE ARE SOME STATISTICS

238
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,296
THAT I'D LIKE
TO SHARE WITH YOU NOW,

239
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:52,766
AND THEY ARE NUMBERS.

240
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,836
SOME 85%
OF PAWNEE RESIDENTS

241
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:57,575
SUPPORT
ABSTINENCE-ONLY EDUCATION.

242
00:08:57,575 --> 00:09:00,147
- AND THE OTHER 15%
ARE PERVERTS.

243
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:01,081
J.K., YOU GUYS.
- [laughs]

244
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:04,487
- AND 100% OF PAWNEEANS
ARE "PERD-VERTS."

245
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:05,757
- [laughs]
- THAT'S THE NAME I CALL

246
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:06,694
FANS OF THIS SHOW

247
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:09,700
BASED ON THE FACT
THAT MY NAME IS PERD.

248
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,469
WE'LL SEE YOU
AFTER THE BREAK, PERD-VERTS.

249
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:12,572
- [laughs]

250
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:14,342
- LOOK, WE NEED AN EMERGENCY
TASK FORCE MEETING.

251
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:15,410
WHAT DO WE DO?

252
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,847
- OBJECTIVE STUDIES
HAVE SHOWN

253
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,317
THAT ABSTINENCE-ONLY
EDUCATION DOESN'T WORK.

254
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:20,420
PEOPLE STILL HAVE SEX.

255
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,690
THEY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO USE PROTECTION,

256
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,525
SO THE DISEASE
KEEPS SPREADING.

257
00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:25,396
WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE
PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE.

258
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:27,668
- ANN PERKINS,
YOUR EXPERTISE IS THRILLING,

259
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,507
AND FRANKLY,
ALMOST AROUSING,

260
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:31,877
BUT THE LAW IS THE LAW.

261
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:33,445
- WELL, YOU'RE
ON CITY COUNCIL NOW.

262
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:35,751
CHANGE THE LAW.
- THE PEOPLE SUPPORT THIS.

263
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:38,323
I COULDN'T FIGHT THOSE NUMBERS
EVEN IF I WANTED TO.

264
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:39,692
IT'S POLITICAL SUICIDE.

265
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:41,561
- SO WE'RE JUST GONNA DO
THE THING WE KNOW DOESN'T WORK?

266
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:43,433
GREAT PLAN.
- THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION, ANN.

267
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,301
PUT AWAY YOUR SEX TOYS

268
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:45,237
AND PLAY WITH THEM
ON YOUR OWN TIME.

269
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:47,976
- [sighs]
- I DID EAT ALL THE BANANAS,

270
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:50,647
SO YOU CAN'T
PLAY WITH THOSE.

271
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,852
- OH, HEY, NICE WORK
ON THE JOBS RESEARCH.

272
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:56,191
- SHH! LOOK.

273
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:58,764
- WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?
HE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING.

274
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,699
- THAT'S THE POINT.

275
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,270
THIS MORNING HE GOT IN,
SAT DOWN IN THERE,

276
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,477
AND HAS BEEN STARING
STRAIGHT AHEAD, DOING NOTHING.

277
00:10:05,477 --> 00:10:07,247
HE'S A ROBOT.
- HE'S NOT A ROBOT.

278
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:09,518
HE'S JUST THINKING.
HE'S GOT A LOT ON HIS MIND.

279
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:11,824
- YEAH, LIKE,
"ONE, ONE, ZERO, ONE.

280
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,392
MUST EAT BABIES FOR FUEL."

281
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:14,863
- [scoffs]
WHY WOULD A ROBOT

282
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:16,767
NEED TO CONSUME
ORGANIC MATTER?

283
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,435
SORRY.

284
00:10:18,435 --> 00:10:20,675
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THEY PROBABLY PUT A TV IN THERE,

285
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:24,348
AND HE'S WATCHING OLD SPEECHES
TO BONE UP OR SOMETHING.

286
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:26,319
LET'S GO SEE.

287
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:27,554
CONGRESSMAN,

288
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:30,494
HERE IS THE BRIEFING PACKET
FOR OUR STRATEGY MEETING LATER.

289
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:33,565
- EXCELLENT,
THANK YOU.

290
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:36,005
ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

291
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:38,710
- NO, SIR.
ALL SYSTEMS ARE OPERATIONAL.

292
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,516
- GREAT. STAY COOL.
HOT ONE OUT THERE TODAY.

293
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,858
- THANK YOU,
CONGRESSMAN.

294
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:52,037
- WIKIPEDIA:
MANKIND'S GREATEST INVENTION/

295
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:53,540
YOU CAN LEARN
ABOUT ANYTHING.

296
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,544
TAKE RAY J, FOR EXAMPLE.

297
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:57,381
WE ALL KNOW HE'S A SINGER,
HE'S BRANDY'S BROTHER,

298
00:10:57,381 --> 00:10:58,750
AND HE WAS IN
THAT CLASSIC SEX TAPE

299
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,387
WITH KIM KARDASHIAN,

300
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:03,026
BUT DID YOU ALSO KNOW
HE'S SNOOP DOGG'S COUSIN

301
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:06,399
AND HE WAS IN THE '96
TIM BURTON MOVIE MARS ATTACKS?

302
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,469
SUDDENLY, YOU'RE ON
THE MARS ATTACKS PAGE.

303
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:11,042
I LOVE GCHAT.
YOU CAN TALK TO ANYBODY.

304
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,814
I HIT UP BRAD.PITT.
IT WASN'T THE ACTOR.

305
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:17,620
IT'S ACTUALLY A GUY NAMED BRAD
THAT'S A TEACHER IN PITTSBURGH.

306
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,658
[gunshots]

307
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:21,762
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT IN COMMON,
BUT WE CHAT QUITE A BIT.

308
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:24,435
"EMOJI" ARE LITTLE CARTOONS
YOU TEXT INSTEAD OF WORDS.

309
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:25,569
INSTEAD OF SAYING,
"WHAT UP, BOO?"

310
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:27,640
YOU CAN TYPE "WHAT UP,"
AND THEN A CUTE, LITTLE GHOST,

311
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,710
'CAUSE
THAT MEANS "BOO."

312
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,712
THERE'S EVEN
A LITTLE INDIAN GUY,

313
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:32,417
BUT HE HAS A TURBAN ON,
WHICH I THINK IS RACIST,

314
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,622
BUT THE ASIAN GUY
ALSO HAS A RACIST HAT ON,

315
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:35,824
AND IT'S LIKE,
"HOLD UP,

316
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:36,993
DIDN'T JAPANESE PEOPLE
INVENT THIS?"

317
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:38,964
PODCASTS.
THERE ARE A MILLION OF 'EM,

318
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,667
AND THEY'RE ALL AMAZING.

319
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,706
JEAN-RALPHIO AND I HAVE ONE
CALLED "NACHO AVERAGE PODCAST,"

320
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:45,176
WHERE WE RATE
DIFFERENT KINDS OF NACHOS.

321
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:47,114
IT SEEMS LIKE--
- OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH!

322
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:48,182
NO MORE TALKING.

323
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:49,885
- BUT YOU TOLD ME
TO GET IT ALL OUT OF MY SYSTEM.

324
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:52,557
- I HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH
YOU HAD IN YOUR SYSTEM.

325
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:53,793
THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM, TOM.

326
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:57,534
YOU ARE AN ADDICT
AND YOU NEED TO CHANGE.

327
00:11:57,534 --> 00:12:01,441
- I'VE DOWNLOADED
EVERY EPISODE OF INTERVENTION.

328
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:04,181
I KNOW WHAT TO DO HERE.

329
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,650
[sober]
YOU'RE RIGHT.

330
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,786
I AM AN ADDICT.

331
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:10,193
I'VE HURT ALL MY FRIENDS
AND FAMILY WITH MY ADDICTION.

332
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:12,596
I WILL ACCEPT THIS GIFT
OF REHABILITATION.

333
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:13,867
- I'M PROUD OF YOU,

334
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,504
BUT ALSO A BIT FEARFUL
THAT WE'RE VERGING ON

335
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:19,044
WHAT I CALL
"FEELINGS TERRITORY,"

336
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:21,247
SO LET'S STARE AT THE FIRE
IN SILENCE.

337
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:23,285
- I'VE HAD
A BREAKTHROUGH, RON.

338
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,123
WHAT DO YOU SAY
YOU CHOP UP SOME MORE WOOD,

339
00:12:25,123 --> 00:12:26,592
AND I'LL TAKE YOUR CAR

340
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:29,933
AND GO GRAB US
SOME VICTORY STEAKS?

341
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,269
PERFECT.

342
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,541
- I'M SO GLAD
YOU'VE COME TO YOUR SENSES.

343
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,645
- HERE'S
OUR EDUCATIONAL PAMPHLET.

344
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:38,583
I RECOMMEND YOU START READING
AT CHAPTER THREE.

345
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,952
- "CHAPTER THREE.

346
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:41,790
THERE'S A PARTY IN YOUR PANTS
AND NO ONE IS INVITED."

347
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,794
- THIS IS CRAZY.
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,

348
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:46,665
THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT DISEASE
IS TO MAGICALLY STOP ALL SEX,

349
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,901
BUT THAT'S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

350
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,875
- WELL, MAYBE NOT WHERE YOU
COME FROM IN "TRAMP-SYLVANIA."

351
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,312
- [laughs]
GOOD ONE, HONEY!

352
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:56,118
- I'M FROM MICHIGAN!

353
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:57,789
THAT WASN'T WORTH SAYING.

354
00:12:57,789 --> 00:12:59,625
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
YOU'RE GONNA GET UP THERE

355
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,860
AND SAY A BUNCH OF STUFF
YOU DON'T BELIEVE?

356
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,561
- WELL, IT'S THE LAW.

357
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:03,766
- I GET THAT.
I JUST--

358
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,370
YOU'RE NOT ACTING
LIKE YOURSELF.

359
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,209
- REALLY?
YOU WANT TO GO THERE?

360
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:09,243
- GO WHERE?

361
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:10,046
- YOU KNOW
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

362
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:11,649
- NO, I HAVE NO IDEA,
HONESTLY.

363
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:12,885
- OKAY, I GUESS
WE'RE GOING THERE.

364
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:13,718
- ARE WE LEAVING?

365
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:15,022
- YOU WANT ME
TO ACT LIKE MYSELF?

366
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:16,091
YOU'RE DRESSED LIKE A COWBOY!

367
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,897
- SO? IT'S FUN,
AND I LIKE IT.

368
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:21,302
- WHEN YOU DATED ANDY,
YOU DRESSED IN FLANNELS.

369
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:23,673
WHEN YOU DATED CHRIS,
YOU DRESSED IN SPANDEX.

370
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:26,211
ANN, PLEASE DO NOT LECTURE ME
ABOUT ACTING LIKE MYSELF.

371
00:13:26,211 --> 00:13:29,417
- YOU'RE DRESSED
LIKE AN ABSTINENCE GIRL

372
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,322
ON THE OUTSIDE!

373
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:32,891
GOD, I'M OFF
MY COMEBACK GAME RIGHT NOW.

374
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:34,394
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T CARE,
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

375
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:36,365
- OKAY.

376
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:37,869
- GIRL,
YOU LOOK LIKE ANNIE OAKLEY

377
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:41,342
AND PIPPI LONGSTOCKING
HAD A BABY AND I LOVE IT.

378
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:44,883
- A DEER JUMPED
IN FRONT OF THE CAR,

379
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:46,251
AND THEN A BEAR
JUMPED IN FRONT OF THE DEER!

380
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:47,687
[sighs]

381
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:50,025

INTO MY BURNER."

384
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,739
- YES, I WENT TO BEST BUY
AND BOUGHT A PHONE.

385
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:58,809
- OUT OF THE CAR, NOW.

386
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:00,813
- WHERE ARE WE GOING, RON?

387
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:02,784
ARE WE WALKING TO BEST BUY
TO GET A BETTER PHONE?

388
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:04,187
[synthesizer pop music]

389
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:06,492
- * I'M MARSHALL LANGMAN
AND I'M HERE TO SAY *

390
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,863
* THAT SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE
IS NEVER THE WAY *

391
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:11,335
* I WAITED TILL MARRIAGE
AND THEN SOME TO DO IT *

392
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:13,005
* IF YOU DECIDE TO SIN,
YOU'LL RUE IT! *

393
00:14:13,005 --> 00:14:14,508
WORD.

394
00:14:14,508 --> 00:14:16,512
- WHOO! WHOO!

395
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:18,216
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
MARSHALL.

396
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:20,019
HELLO,
MY AGED FRIENDS.

397
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:22,457
SOME OF YOU MIGHT REMEMBER
THAT I WAS HERE BEFORE.

398
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:24,963
- I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
- WELL, I WAS.

399
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:26,999
BUT I HAVE
A NEW MESSAGE FOR YOU.

400
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:31,875
THE BEST WAY TO BE SAFE
IS TO SIMPLY POSTPONE SEX

401
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,479
UNTIL MARRIAGE.

402
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:35,550
- I AM NOT GOING TO BE TOLD
NOT TO HAVE SEX

403
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,322
BY SOMEONE
WHO'S TEN YEARS MY JUNIOR.

404
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:40,359
- AMEN, GLADYS.
YOU'RE RIGHT!

405
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:42,430
NOT ABOUT THE AGE THING,
ABOUT THE OTHER THING.

406
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,101
- PERHAPS YOU MIGHT
UNDERSTAND IT BETTER

407
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:46,170
IF I READ TO YOU
FROM THIS PAMPHLET,

408
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,843
SO YOU THINK
YOU KNOW MORE THAN GOD.

409
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:49,777
"OUR BODIES
ARE GOD'S GIFT,

WHAT--?

415
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,539

THE CONDOM DEMONSTRATION AGAIN?

'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHERE LOU HAS BEEN.

418
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:16,565
OH, SCREW IT.
OKAY, HERE.

419
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:17,701
THIS IS A PENIS, RIGHT?

420
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:19,571
YOU PUT A CONDOM ON IT,
AND YOU PULL THE TIP LIKE THIS,

421
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:22,242
AND YOU ROLL IT
ALL THE WAY DOWN THE PENIS.

422
00:15:22,242 --> 00:15:23,645
TELL YOU WHAT,
CONDOMS FOR EVERYBODY!

423
00:15:23,645 --> 00:15:24,647

00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:26,617
SAFE SEX FOR EVERYBODY!
[cheering and commotion]

425
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:27,887
HEY!
- THIS IS--

426
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,232
- IT'S A CENSURE
FROM THE MAYOR'S OFFICE.

427
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,034
IT'S SO OFFICIAL.

428
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,503
I MEAN,
LOOK AT THE PAPER QUALITY.

429
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:37,339
- THIS IS NO JOKE.

430
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:39,310
- I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO HELP EDUCATE THE PUBLIC,

431
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,383
BUT I ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION
TO UPHOLD THE LAWS.

432
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:43,919
YOU'RE MY BOSS.
WHAT'S MY MOVE HERE?

433
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,523
- ACTUALLY, LESLIE,
YOU'RE MY BOSS NOW.

434
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:46,391
- THAT'S RIGHT.

435
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:48,328
WHY AM I STILL
WEIRDLY SCARED OF YOU?

436
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:50,566
- I'M VERY CONFIDENT
AND I MAKE A LOT OF EYE CONTACT.

437
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:51,702
- HMM.

438
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:52,637
- AS YOUR CITY MANAGER,

439
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:56,245
I RECOMMEND
THAT YOU FORMALLY APOLOGIZE

440
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:57,113
AND THAT, IN THE FUTURE,

441
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:59,251
YOU STICK
TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW,

442
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,421
BUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
AS YOUR BEST FRIEND...

443
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:03,225
- WHA--?
- I KIND OF ADMIRE

444
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:04,494
WHAT YOU DID UP THERE.

445
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:06,097
MADE ME HAPPY
THAT I VOTED FOR YOU

446
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:08,436
AS MY CITY COUNCIL MEMBER.

447
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:11,140
- OKAY, THIS IS GREAT,
JUST MAKE SURE

448
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,376
THAT YOU DON'T GO
TOO TIGHT ON HIM, ALL RIGHT?

449
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:14,380
- HEY, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
- MM.

450
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,351
- WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THE CONGRESSMAN?

451
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,356
SERIOUSLY, LIKE,
HE SEEMS A LITTLE ROBOTIC...

452
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:20,425
- [chuckles]
- OR SOMETHING?

453
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:22,296
- YEAH, YEAH,
HE'S GREAT, YEAH.

454
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:23,231
HE TURNS IT ON
WHEN HE HAS TO,

455
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:25,302
AND WHEN HE DOESN'T,
HE JUST SITS THERE.

456
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:27,407
THERE'S NO SURPRISES,
IT'S PERFECT.

457
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:30,046
OH, CONGRESSMAN,
CAN YOU JUST SIT IN THE CHAIR

458
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:32,016
TO TEST
THE SATELLITE FEED?

459
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:33,451
- OKEYDOKEY.

460
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,455
- JUST RUN THROUGH
SOME OF YOUR STUMP SPEECH.

461
00:16:35,455 --> 00:16:38,562
- WE'VE GONE THROUGH
SOME DIFFICULT TIMES,

462
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:41,434
BUT WE'RE FROM OHIO.
WE'RE TOUGH.

463
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:44,241
WE WON'T JUST SURVIVE
THESE DARK TIMES,

464
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:46,544
WE WILL THRIVE!

465
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:48,448
- THAT'S GREAT.
GOOD.

466
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:51,188
- COOL BEANS.

467
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:54,261
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

468
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:58,702
- GOD, I LOVE HIM.
HE'S THE BEST.

469
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:01,407
- I'M SORRY
I CRASHED YOUR CAR.

470
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:03,545
PLEASE FORGIVE ME, RON.
PLEASE, RON?

471
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:06,150
PLEASE?

472
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,687
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME?

473
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:11,528
- WHY DO YOU NEED TO BE
CONSTANTLY DISTRACTED, TOM?

474
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,634
- THE TRUTH IS

475
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,571
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME
LOOKING AT SCREENS

476
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:18,242
BECAUSE RECENTLY,

477
00:17:18,242 --> 00:17:19,511
A LOT OF THE STUFF
IN MY REAL LIFE

478
00:17:19,511 --> 00:17:21,181
ISN'T GOING THAT GREAT.

479
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:24,254
SO I'D RATHER PLAY DOODLE JUMP
THEN THINK ABOUT THAT.

480
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:27,292
OKAY?
I'M SORRY, I REALLY AM.

481
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:29,563
- GO SIT IN YOUR OFFICE

482
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:32,903
WHILE I CONSIDER WHETHER
TO TURN YOU IN TO THE JUDGE.

483
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:36,311
AND WHILE YOU'RE THERE,
NEITHER DOODLE NOR JUMP.

484
00:17:40,753 --> 00:17:44,526
- HEY. I JUST WANTED
TO COME LEND MY SUPPORT.

485
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:45,830
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY
OUT THERE?

486
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,369
- I DON'T KNOW.
I GOT CENSURED, IT'S A BIG DEAL.

487
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:51,308
- WELL, IF YOU ASK ME,
YOU WERE ELECTED TO LEAD

488
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:52,509
AND NOT TO FOLLOW.

489
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:54,814
WHICH IS PROBABLY
WHAT I SHOULD'VE SAID

490
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,385
INSTEAD OF WHAT I DID SAY.

491
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:57,854
- I FEEL TERRIBLE
ABOUT WHAT I SAID TOO.

492
00:17:57,854 --> 00:17:59,391
- NO, YOU WERE RIGHT.

493
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:01,560
- I KNOW,
BUT I STILL FEEL TERRIBLE.

494
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,162
I'M SORRY, CONTINUE.

495
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:05,403
- I KIND OF LOST MYSELF
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

496
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:07,407
I BOUGHT A LASSO ONLINE,
LESLIE.

497
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:08,341
- YIKES.

498
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:10,880
- I TURNED ALL MY JEANS
INTO DAISY DUKES.

499
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,217
MY PERSONALITY
KINDA GETS SWEPT UP

500
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,425
IN WHATEVER GUY I'M DATING,
AND I WANT TO CHANGE THAT.

501
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:17,727
I BROKE IT OFF WITH RICKY.

502
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,396
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD,
BUT I'LL TELL YOU,

503
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:21,702
HE'LL NEVER
LASSO ANOTHER HEIFER

504
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:25,509
AS FINE AS YOU,
ANNIE OAKLEY.

505
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:27,580
- THE STORY
OF THAT COMMERCIAL BREAK IS

506
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,515
IT'S OVER.

507
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:31,554
LESLIE, WHAT EXACTLY
DOES "CENSURE" MEAN?

508
00:18:31,554 --> 00:18:33,491
- IT MEANS THAT I HAVE BEEN
FORMALLY DISCIPLINED

509
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:34,727
FOR BREAKING THE LAW.

510
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:38,302
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
"YOU BREAK IT, YOU BUY IT."

511
00:18:38,302 --> 00:18:39,603
- THAT DOESN'T REALLY
APPLY HERE.

512
00:18:39,603 --> 00:18:41,707
- TELL THAT
TO THE FOLKS AT PIER 1,

513
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:45,014
AN ESTABLISHMENT
I'M NO LONGER ALLOWED INSIDE.

514
00:18:45,014 --> 00:18:46,518
- PERD,
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE.

515
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:47,820
- THANK YOU.

516
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,692
- APOLOGIZE FOR THE ANTIQUATED
LAWS IN THIS CITY.

517
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:53,631
STATES THAT TEACH
ABSTINENCE-ONLY

518
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:56,003
HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES
OF TEEN PREGNANCY AND STDs.

519
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:57,907
TO CONTINUE THIS POLICY
IS INSANE.

520
00:18:57,907 --> 00:19:01,548
LOOK, WE ALL WANT
THE SAME THING, RIGHT?

521
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:04,487
WE WANT FEWER UNWANTED
PREGNANCIES AND FEWER STDs.

522
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:06,858
WHY DON'T WE USE
EVERY WEAPON THAT WE HAVE?

523
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:09,396
I KNOW THAT MOST OF YOU
DON'T AGREE WITH ME ON THIS,

524
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:12,603
BUT I'M GOING TO FIGHT VERY HARD
TO CHANGE YOUR MINDS,

525
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:15,008
AND UNTIL THEN,
I WILL TAKE THIS CENSURE,

526
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:19,049
AND I WILL WEAR IT PROUDLY,
LIKE A BADGE OF HONOR.

527
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:20,585
- WOW, STRONG WORDS
FROM A WOMAN

528
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:23,492
WHO IS TRYING TO PIN
A PIECE OF PAPER TO HER BLAZER.

529
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:26,730
NEXT UP ON THE PROGRAM,
WE HEAR FROM YOU, OUR FANS,

530
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,838
IN OUR NEW SEGMENT,
"ARE YOU THERE, PERD-VERTS?

531
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:33,044
IT'S ME, PERD,
HOSTING A NEW SEGMENT."

532
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:36,585
- [groans]
I'M SO BORED.

533
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:37,819
- I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU, SON.

534
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:39,790
- MY iPHONE?
- NO.

535
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,727
I AM GIVING YOU
A NON-ELECTRONIC BOOK

536
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:42,963
MADE OF PAPER FROM A TREE.

537
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:47,607
IT IS CALLED
AUTO REPAIR MANUAL: 1982.

538
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:49,611
YOU WILL READ THIS BOOK
FROM COVER TO COVER,

539
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:52,682
THEN YOU WILL ASSIST ME IN
REPAIRING THE DAMAGE TO MY CAR.

540
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:54,686
I WILL NOT REPORT YOU
TO THE JUDGE,

541
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:57,460
BUT IF YOU SLIP UP AGAIN,
YOU WILL HAVE MUCH MORE TO FEAR

542
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,796
THAN SOME FEEBLE
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE IN A ROBE.

543
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:01,468
- THANKS.
- TWO MORE THINGS.

544
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,402
WHEN YOU DO
GET YOUR PHONE BACK,

545
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,106
YOU WILL NOT STARE AT IT

546
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:05,876
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING
WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

547
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:08,079
LOOK A MAN IN THE EYE
WHEN YOU SPEAK WITH HIM.

548
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,051
AND SECOND,
IF YOU EVER NEED

549
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:13,691
TO DISCUSS YOUR PROBLEMS
WITH SOMEONE...

550
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:16,498
FIND LESLIE.
SHE LIVES FOR THAT CRAP.

551
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:19,636
GET TO WORK.

552
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,907
- THEY'RE KILLING ME
IN THE PRESS.

553
00:20:21,907 --> 00:20:24,713
THE PAWNEE SUN
IS CALLING ME "LOOSE-LY GROPE."

554
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:26,484
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T EVEN CARE.

555
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:27,652
I'M GONNA KICK
ALL THEIR ASSES!

556
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:28,788
I AM SO FIRED UP!

557
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:31,093
I'M GONNA GO RIGHT NOW
AND DRINK, LIKE, 1,000 RED BULLS

558
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,765
SO I CAN DRAFT A NEW BILL
TO UNDO ABSTINENCE-ONLY.

559
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,036
- MAN,
YOU ARE JUST A MACHINE.

560
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,707
GET STUFF DONE.

561
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:39,677
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU SEND IT TO ME
WHEN YOU HAVE A DRAFT?

562
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:41,180
I'LL TRY TO HELP.
- YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

563
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,616
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE OUT A LOT OF CURSING,

564
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,052
'CAUSE LIKE I SAID,
I AM VERY FIRED UP.

565
00:20:44,052 --> 00:20:47,225
- WELL, YOU GO GET 'EM.
I LOVE YOU.

566
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,697
- I LOVE YOU TOO.
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

567
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:51,200
- I CAN'T DO THAT
RIGHT NOW.

568
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,269
- [laughs]

569
00:20:54,574 --> 00:20:56,910
- YO, YOU READY TO GO?
- WHY, YES, I AM, APRIL!

570
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,782
LET'S GO NOW!

571
00:20:58,782 --> 00:20:59,784
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU?

572
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:01,788
- [fake laugh]
WONDERFUL!

573
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:03,625
HEY,
BE CAREFUL OUT THERE.

574
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,729
TRAFFIC IS NUTS
ON THE STREETS AND ROADS.

575
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:08,066
- OH, NO!
THEY GOT YOU!

576
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,836
- HA, HA, HA, HA,
AH, HA, HA.

577
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,707
TERRIFIC!
HEY, I'M HUNGRY.

578
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:14,280
LET'S GO EAT SOME BATTERIES--
I MEAN, HUMAN FOOD.

579
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,783
- HEY,
UH, BATTERIES--

580
00:21:15,783 --> 00:21:17,752
I MEAN, HUMAN FOOD
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

581
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:21,025
WONDERFUL.

582
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:23,264
- LET'S GO.
- [laughs]
