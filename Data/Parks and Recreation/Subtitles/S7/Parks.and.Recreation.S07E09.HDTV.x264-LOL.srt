1
00:00:00,744 --> 00:00:02,445
We need to go over the schedule
leading up to the primary.

2
00:00:02,482 --> 00:00:04,081
- Let's talk shop.
- Ooh, shop talk!

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,825
One of my five favorite
types of talk,

4
00:00:05,945 --> 00:00:08,079
along with pillow, girl,
real, and TED.

5
00:00:08,114 --> 00:00:09,681
Why are you wearing a poncho?

6
00:00:09,715 --> 00:00:13,018
Oh, because every surface area
in your house is sticky.

7
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:15,687
Last time I was here, I found
a melted crayon on my blazer.

8
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:16,822
Okay.

9
00:00:16,856 --> 00:00:19,357
I have a photo op
with Gryzzl tomorrow.

10
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:21,493
Between now and then, we
have a ton of stuff scheduled.

11
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:24,262
Looks like we're gonna have
to skip the pie-baking event

12
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:25,864
and the ceremonial squash toss.

13
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:26,832
- Oh.
- Oh, really?

14
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:28,100
We have to skip that?

15
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:30,335
I love watching those squashes
fly through the air.

16
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:31,603
I kind of like
the way they land.

17
00:00:31,637 --> 00:00:32,604
Me too!

18
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:33,605
[both laughing]

19
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:34,840
Okay, excuse me,

20
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:38,210
but I have to get back to a city
where things happen.

21
00:00:38,244 --> 00:00:39,344
Okay.

22
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:41,079
This campaign is about to start
in earnest.

23
00:00:41,114 --> 00:00:43,215
Things are about to get
real intense.

24
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:44,416
Leslie, you ready?

25
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,484
- Me Leslie?
- Yeah.

26
00:00:45,518 --> 00:00:47,285
Well, I was an actual candidate,

27
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,421
so I think I can handle
being a candidate's wife.

28
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:50,989
I know all the issues
inside and out.

29
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:52,490
Mm.
See, that's the problem.

30
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:54,960
Being the wife of
is a minefield.

31
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:56,128
If you were just
a ding-dong,

32
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:57,696
I would just
slap a flag pin on you.

33
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,231
I'd pour some Valium
down your throat

34
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:02,200
and just shove you behind
the podium way upstage.

35
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:04,903
It's the smarties
that freak people out.

36
00:01:04,937 --> 00:01:06,605
I think you're underestimating
the voters.

37
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:08,540
[laughing]

38
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:12,177
I don't think that is possible.

39
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:13,445
(Leslie) Stephen, be careful!

40
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,514
[gasps]

41
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:18,049
Poncho!

42
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:21,019
[triumphant music]

43
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:29,060
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

44
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:40,639
I know you normally
hate foundations,

45
00:01:40,673 --> 00:01:43,008
but this one
I think you'll actually like.

46
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:45,377
We take people that don't know
what they want to do

47
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:48,213
and then put them to work doing
cool stuff all over the world,

48
00:01:48,247 --> 00:01:49,555
and I start in a couple months.

49
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:52,851
Well, I had hoped you'd choose
a more dignified trade

50
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:55,153
like masonry or logging,

51
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:57,155
but you are
out of local government,

52
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,124
and that's a step
in the right direction.

53
00:01:59,158 --> 00:02:01,560
It's definitely
the job I wanted...

54
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:07,599
But it means that we
have to move to Washington.

55
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:11,203
Well...
then bully for you.

56
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:12,971
If you intend to move,

57
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:16,074
I suppose you should return
the spare key to my house,

58
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:19,211
the one I gave you years ago
when you were my assistant,

59
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:21,113
for emergencies.

60
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:22,180
Okay.

61
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:24,516
Good talk.

62
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:28,720
(Ben) This neighborhood

63
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:30,772
has been mostly abandoned
for years,

64
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:33,226
but now, thanks
to the new Gryzzl headquarters,

65
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,495
this district will soon
transform

66
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:38,598
into a hub of innovation
for decades to come.

67
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:39,599
Mr. Wyatt!

68
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:41,334
Your campaign released
a schedule,

69
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:43,803
and it looks like your wife
is skipping the Pie-mary.

70
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:45,138
Care to explain?

71
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:47,740
The Pie-mary
is a Southern Indiana tradition

72
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:49,308
where Congressional
candidates' wives

73
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:51,778
face off
in a pie-baking contest.

74
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:53,313
The last contest winner

75
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,348
was June Hartwell's
buttermilk meringue.

76
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:58,785
Last contest loser
was all women.

77
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,887
Leslie would be the first
candidate's wife

78
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:02,522
not to enter the Pie-mary.

79
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:05,158
What kind of a statement
are you making by skipping it?

80
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:07,060
We're--I'm not making
any kind of statement.

81
00:03:07,094 --> 00:03:09,095
We're just focusing
on bigger issues,

82
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:13,733
like Ben's $150 million
revitalization project.

83
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:14,934
Pardon me.
I need to get through.

84
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:15,935
Pardon me. Excuse me.

85
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,003
Mike Patterson here.

86
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:18,237
Leslie, you've
made it pretty clear

87
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:20,032
that you don't think homemaking
is important.

88
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,708
Do you ever cook
for your children,

89
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:24,210
and who's even watching
your children right now,

90
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:25,778
while you're out
God only knows where?

91
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:26,894
What are you talking about?

92
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:28,381
I'm standing right here
in front of you.

93
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:30,216
Okay. Take it easy.
Let's not get emotional.

94
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,618
Okay.
We have to run.

95
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:33,386
We'll see you all
at my economic address.

96
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,587
Thanks for coming, everybody.

97
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:36,456
What other traditions
are you against, Leslie?

98
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,191
Baseball?
Hugging your children?

99
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:39,892
How much did that haircut cost?

100
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:42,061
None of your business,
and thank you for noticing.

101
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:44,330
My desk was right here,

102
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:45,999
sitting right on top of it
this whole time.

103
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,033
How much money is it?

104
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,067
It's not money.

105
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,469
I told you, it's Ron's key.

106
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:50,903
I hid it in here years ago.

107
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:52,238
Ah! Wait!

108
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:53,539
Yeah, no. No key.

109
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:56,576
Just a note and a movie ticket
stub and four teeth.

110
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,931
"If you are looking
for Ron's key,

111
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,712
"I moved it,
and you'll never find it.

112
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:01,047
Cordially, April."

113
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:02,348
Well, where'd you put it, then?

114
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:03,883
I don't know.
It was eight years ago.

115
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,318
Oh, God.

116
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:07,920
A key to Ron's house is lost
in a government building.

117
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,036
That's his worst nightmare.

118
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:09,989
Listen, babe.

119
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:11,491
All we got to do

120
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:14,394
is train Champion
to sniff out Ron's key.

121
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:15,762
Okay.

122
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,864
All we need is Ron's key
to give him a scent.

123
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:19,932
So give me the key,
and I'll get you that key.

124
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,701
[moaning]

125
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:25,305
<i>No, You're Wrong</i>
with Mike Patterson.

126
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:26,406
Welcome back to the program.

127
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,107
My guest is June Hartwell,

128
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,543
wife of incumbent Congressman,
Paul Hartwell.

129
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:31,744
Now, June, we all know

130
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,299
what Ben Wyatt's wife
is really saying.

131
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,714
By skipping the Pie-mary,

132
00:04:34,748 --> 00:04:38,017
she's saying women who love
their families are stupid.

133
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:40,453
Well, Mike, we all
make certain choices.

134
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:42,722
Ms. Knope chose
to try to have it all.

135
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:44,691
I chose to put my family first.

136
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,005
Well, I'm just speculating here,

137
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:47,694
but do you think
that Leslie Knope's actions

138
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:50,063
indicate that she actually hates
her family?

139
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:54,100
Well, it only took three hours
for Jen to be right.

140
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:55,668
I'm officially a distraction.

141
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:56,869
I'm gonna enter
that Pie-mary.

142
00:04:56,904 --> 00:04:58,771
This is just nonsense.
It'll blow over.

143
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:01,474
And the Pie-mary
is ridiculous and antiquated.

144
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:02,875
But the more
they talk about this,

145
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,078
the less they're gonna talk
about your economic plan.

146
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:06,713
Besides,
I'm good at making pies,

147
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:09,449
so I'll win,
and then I can promote

148
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:12,352
my self-published women's rights
barbecue cookbook--

149
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:13,886
<i>The Feminine Mesquite.</i>

150
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:15,388
Everything's fine.

151
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:17,023
(April)
I had it in a safe place,

152
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:19,158
and then I moved it
to protect it,

153
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,980
and I don't remember where.

154
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,004
I see.

155
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:23,472
(Andy) Don't be mad, Ron.

156
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:25,741
She hid it too good,

157
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,776
and she left a string of clues.

158
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,080
It's an impossible puzzle,
and I love puzzles!

159
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:35,217
A minimal, unhelpful note,
these appear to be human teeth,

160
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,218
and what is this?

161
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,519
<i>Twilight: New Moon.</i>

162
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:40,022
It's a movie,
but I've never seen it.

163
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,790
It's, like,
about lame werewolves

164
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,058
and vampires and stuff.

165
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,360
Donna likes those things!

166
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:47,129
(Ron) Dollars to doughnuts
this points us her way.

167
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:50,332
Finally, a scavenger hunt
worthy of my time.

168
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:51,400
Onward!

169
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:53,535
(Leslie) Okay.

170
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:55,671
Snacks given, kids tucked in,
books read,

171
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:57,939
three simultaneous meltdowns
for no reason,

172
00:05:57,974 --> 00:05:59,541
kids tucked back in,

173
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:01,944
one of them briefly
got outside somehow,

174
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:02,911
kids back in bed.

175
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,179
They're all napping.

176
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:07,149
Okay, I got everything
you need for pie domination.

177
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:09,251
I even got
an extra whipped-cream can.

178
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,587
One for baking,
one for directly-into-mouth.

179
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,223
Oh, you know me so well.

180
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:16,058
[doorbell rings]

181
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:18,160
That might be one of the kids.

182
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:19,194
Hi, Leslie.

183
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:20,362
Elise Yarktin

184
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:22,197
from the Indiana
Organization of Women.

185
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:24,600
Oh, my goodness!
Elise, please come in.

186
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,867
[gasps]
Wait!

187
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:28,170
Are you here to give me
the Woman of the Year award?

188
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:29,471
I have a speech prepared.

189
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:31,106
Would you like
to see it right now?

190
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,107
No.

191
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,542
Leslie, we were thrilled

192
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:35,711
to find out you were boycotting
that ridiculous Pie-mary,

193
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:37,579
but we just got word
you've decided to enter?

194
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,047
Yeah.

195
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:41,883
Well, I agree that it's dumb,
but this is not about me.

196
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,354
It's about Ben, and he will do
more for women than Hartwell.

197
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:47,222
So, you know, lose a battle,
win the war.

198
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:48,690
That kind of thing.
It's the way to go.

199
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,392
Look, the Pie-mary
is retrogressive

200
00:06:50,426 --> 00:06:52,594
and misogynistic,
and if you participate,

201
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:53,695
we will have no choice

202
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,931
but to protest you and Ben
at the event.

203
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:58,100
Hope you like pies...

204
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:00,068
in yo' face.

205
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:01,803
Metaphorically.
We'll be civil.

206
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,107
Elise, there is no bigger
defender of gender equality

207
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:07,109
than Leslie Knope,
and my husband, Ben,

208
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:10,245
is a progressive champion
of women's rights.

209
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,813
(Ben) Babe, the oven's ready.

210
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,515
Chop-chop!
Time to get baking.

211
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:16,184
Daddy want pie!

212
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:17,962
Hi. Ben Wyatt.

213
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:22,936
We have a wonderfully
small number of clues.

214
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:24,389
One is this ticket.

215
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:27,292
Did you see this movie
about vampires and such?

216
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:28,226
<i>New Moon?</i>

217
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,895
Yeah, I saw it with April.

218
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,730
She was so hopped up
on painkillers

219
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:33,131
from getting
her wisdom teeth out,

220
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,700
I convinced her
to see it with me.

221
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,602
The teeth!
They're yours.

222
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,237
You were super out of it.

223
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,672
You kept yelling,
"Team Voldemort!" at the screen,

224
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:41,840
and we were kicked out.

225
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:43,508
I was furious.

226
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:45,377
You only get to see
the second <i> Twilight </i> film

227
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:46,745
for the seventh time once.

228
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,914
Do you remember anything
about a key

229
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:51,717
or April doing
anything unusual that day?

230
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:54,219
She did make us stop
by the shoe-shine stand

231
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:55,654
before she left,
because she wanted

232
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:57,322
to drop something off for Andy.

233
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,091
She had a real bad crush on him.

234
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,928
[laughing]
Oh, babe! You had a crush on me!

235
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:04,196
That's embarrassing.

236
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,163
We're married.

237
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:06,465
Still!

238
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:08,066
To the shoe-shine stand!

239
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:10,636
- Stop! Stop!
- Ooh, chase me!

240
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:16,041
Garry, what the hell
are you doing?

241
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:17,209
Oh, gosh.

242
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:19,478
Well, I dropped my wedding ring
down this grate,

243
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:20,913
and then I was trying
to get it out,

244
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:22,648
and I dropped my keys
down there too,

245
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:24,683
so I can't leave.

246
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:26,418
Damn. This takes me back.

247
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:27,886
You mind if I stay and watch?

248
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:28,887
Oh, not at all.

249
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:30,322
Appreciate the company.

250
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:32,290
(Leslie) The I.O.W.
does not mess around,

251
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,625
which, normally,
is why I love them,

252
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,993
but now I'm on the other side.

253
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,161
Oh, my God, Ben!

254
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:38,196
I gave them $100
in their annual pledge.

255
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:40,799
Do you know how many anti-me
signs that could buy?

256
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,635
You just don't do
the pie contest, obviously.

257
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,203
Then we're just back
where we started.

258
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:46,559
Then it just seems
like I'm saying

259
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:48,040
I'm better
than the women who bake.

260
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:50,042
What should we do?
Should we get a divorce?

261
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:51,810
Well, how about this?

262
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:53,779
What if I register
for the contest?

263
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,047
I bake the pie.

264
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:56,682
I act as my own wife.

265
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:57,916
Oh, that could work.

266
00:08:57,951 --> 00:08:59,951
We sidestep the controversy,

267
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:02,988
we refocus the campaign
onto the actual candidate,

268
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:05,824
and then we flip the antiquated
tradition right on its head.

269
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:08,393
Exactly, but more importantly,

270
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:12,631
we change the idea
of what a pie is.

271
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:14,366
I feel like
that's not more important,

272
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,768
but I-I like the energy
that we have, so let's hear it.

273
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:17,936
Okay. Picture this.

274
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:21,606
Crust on the bottom,
filling, crust on top.

275
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:22,741
What am I describing?

276
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:23,909
A pie.

277
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:26,345
No, but you're
in the right zone.

278
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,346
Oh.

279
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,047
- Calzone!
- Sure.

280
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:31,683
Pies are just
sweet calzones, honey,

281
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:33,685
and I'm good at making calzones.

282
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
You're amazing.

283
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:35,988
I can win this thing.

284
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:37,489
Of course you can, baby!

285
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:38,924

Yeah, I mean,
anytime I lose my ring,

she turns
into a real grumpy goose.

- Is that so?
- Oh, yeah.

296

She'll say, you know,

if it wasn't screwed
on tight."

298
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,717

I mean, they rattle

(Ron) They must have moved
it during the remodel.

312
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,746
It's probably
in basement storage.

00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:38,781
To the basement!

Nothing.
We're not doing anything.

We don't know anything
about that.

(Ron) Boys, think.

322
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:57,600
We are on a quest,

and we are not leaving
until we get an answer.

324
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,737
Well, we're on our own quest,

325
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:03,939
which is to squeeze this
just tight enough

326
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:05,674
to make my eyes bulge out
a little bit,

Oh! Hey!

Last week this real scary ghost
came down here looking for it.

00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:18,521
It had black hair, but you could
see through its skin,

333
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:19,989
and it didn't like me,

334

but that's just 'cause
I got a soul of a Ghostbuster.

335

Yeah, it said something

336
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:26,462
about how it was worried
Brett was gonna mug it.

337
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:29,432
Okay, so we're looking
for a racist ghost

The time that you told us you
were mugged in the park,

344
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:41,110
what were you
reaching for in the river?

345
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:43,078
- A burrito.
- That's right!

346
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:46,048
You fell in the river
reaching for a burrito.

one of my finer moments.

when I get home tonight.

352
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:56,358
[sighs]

353
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:58,727
Gayle might even call me
the B word.

354
00:11:58,762 --> 00:11:59,829
"Bozo."

355
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:01,430
- Wow.
- Mm.

356
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:03,866
We are very different people.

357
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,535
Did you hear back from Elise?

358
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,937
Oh, yeah, we're good.

359
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:09,538
The I.O.W.
is not gonna protest us.

360
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:11,440
How's your pie?

361
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,542
I don't know.
I didn't make a pie.

362
00:12:13,577 --> 00:12:14,543
[laughs] Okay.

363
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,111
How is your dessert calzone?

364
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:17,246
It's ready.

365
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,882
The question is, are they?

366
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,317
All right.

367
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:24,687
Our next contestant is candidate
Ben Wyatt's wife, Leslie.

368
00:12:24,721 --> 00:12:27,523
Let's see what Mrs. Wyatt
has baked up for us, shall we?

369
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:29,425
It's actually Ms. Knope,

370
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,694
and, actually, right now
it's Mr. Wyatt.

371
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:33,295
Leslie has her own busy life,

372
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,464
and I happen to be
an excellent pie maker,

373
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:37,566
so we figured
we'd switch it up a bit.

374
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:39,502
Now, pack your suitcases,

375
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:42,671
because we're going
to a little town

376
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:46,342
called a-Napoli
in Ital-y.

377
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:49,178
(all)
Free Ben Wyatt! Free Ben Wyatt!

378
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:51,714
Excuse me.
Free me from what?

379
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:53,616
From the tyranny of women.

380
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,984
We are the Male Men.

381
00:12:55,018 --> 00:12:56,719
We are a men's rights
activist group,

382
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:58,187
and we are fed up!

383
00:12:58,221 --> 00:12:59,922
I'm sorry.
What's happening now?

384
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:05,394
Behind every successful woman
is a man she has oppressed.

385
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:08,364
First, Leslie Knope
poaches her husband's campaign

386
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:10,032
by making it all about her.

387
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:12,134
Now she's forcing him
to bake pies

388
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:13,969
and enter a contest for her?

389
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:15,037
Oh, excuse me!

390
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:16,372
I'm not forcing him
to do anything.

391
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:17,606
He loves to cook.

392
00:13:17,641 --> 00:13:20,376
He--he has five
personalized aprons.

393
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,545
Oh, so I guess
he was asking for it

394
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:24,046
because of the way
he was dressed.

395
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:29,152
We are sick and tired
of this feminized society!

396
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:31,840
Men have had
a very rough go of it

397
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,078
for--just recently,
and it ends now!

398
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:37,813
Male and proud!

399
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:41,510
(all)
Male and proud! Male and proud!

400
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:44,820
Leslie Knope exemplifies

401
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,242
the feminist attack
on our values.

402
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:48,610
She could learn
a little something

403
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:50,445
about traditional
family structure

404
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,347
from me and my husband,
Marshall.

405
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:54,482
Um, fierce alert!
Eat 'em up, honey!

406
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:55,884
The idea that feminism

407
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,453
is an attack on family values
is absurd.

408
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:00,822
(Joan) Ooh, so you're
defending Leslie Knope.

409
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:02,290
No. Absolutely not.

410
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:03,892
Frankly, I don't
think she's done enough

411
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,728
to distance herself
from this misogynistic lunacy.

412
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,364
(Joan) Let's turn,
now, to Sasha Dunkirk.

413
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:12,767
She is head of the group
Women Against Feminism.

414
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:14,636
What a surprise!

415
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,239
The woman is only talking
to other women.

416
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,875
Can we have one conversation
about feminism

417
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,677
where men get to be in charge?

418
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:24,345
I actually agree with him.

419
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,314
I don't need your pity.

420
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:29,484
Joan, Leslie Knope and I
are united

421
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:31,519
in our disgust
of this week's events.

422
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:35,323
Leslie, if you're watching,
I, Brandi Maxxxx,

423
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:39,394
star of <i> 69 Jump Street</i>
and <i> 50 Shaved Old Gays,</i>

424
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:40,795
have your back.

425
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,863
Oof!

426
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:43,765
Really stepped in it
this time, Knope.

427
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,433
Why isn't
the other candidate's wife

428
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,935
being scrutinized like this?

429
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,538
Because June Hartwell
is a lukewarm bowl of nothing.

430
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:51,973
She started
an awareness campaign

431
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,241
called "Bring a Sweater."

432
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,809
She calls it
goose-bump prevention.

433
00:14:54,844 --> 00:14:56,277
Come on, you guys,
you know the drill.

434
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,046
Just ignore the fact
that you're right,

435
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,616
put on your blandest outfits,
so that one, hopefully,

436
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,610
and then just go out there
and publicly apologize.

437
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:04,586
Done.

438
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,554
- What?
- Apologize for what?

439
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:08,467
Doesn't matter.
Just say you're sorry.

440
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:09,802
It's like taking
a shot of tequila.

441
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:11,424
You just got to force it down.

442
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,693
Suddenly, the world feels
so much more pleasant.

443
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:16,228
I do three shots every time
I have to enter this house.

444
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,799
[sighs]
[doorbell rings]

445
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,867
Donna, what are you
doing here so early?

446
00:15:21,902 --> 00:15:23,069
I come bearing gifts.

447
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:25,004
First off,
I got a dude in maintenance

448
00:15:25,038 --> 00:15:26,439
to open up that grate
this morning.

449
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:30,876
So here's your rings,
keys, credit cards,

450
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:32,578
and I found some heart medicine
I assume is yours.

451
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,714
Yeah, no, that's mine.
That's mine. Oh, my gosh.

452
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:36,182
Also, I thought I'd bring over

453
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:38,050
some fresh oranges
for you and Gayle.

454
00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:40,252
Okay, well,
that is just so kind, Donna.

455
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,387
Thank you.

456
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:43,556
- You're one of a kind, Garry.
- Oh.

457
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,158
And I just want to thank you
for taking me down memory lane,

458
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:47,560
you big B word.

459
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:49,862
- Oh.
- "Buddy."

460
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:54,233
(Milton) So much has
changed around here.

461
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:57,436
Uhh, I just wanted to remember
the good old days,

462
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:59,605
when a shoe shine was two bits

463
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,242
and there were no Mexicans
in the music business.

464
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:05,177
If you don't mind,
Councilman Milton,

465
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:07,346
we just need
to search this stand.

466
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:09,215
Yes! Found it.

467
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:15,621
"Hi, Andy.
I hate people, but you are okay.

468
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:17,623
It's weird. Woof, woof.
April."

469
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:19,091
Oh, my God, babe,
you were so into me.

470
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:20,359
That's hilarious.

471
00:16:20,394 --> 00:16:21,560
That's it.

472
00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:24,196
It's a dead end.
No more clues.

473
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:28,000
See me in my office.

474
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:29,735
If it makes you feel any better,

475
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,805
I had a big crush on you too.

476
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,142
It does make me feel
a little better. Thanks.

477
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:37,777
Oh, thank God.

478
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:39,845
Get off my boat!

479
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,047
[applause]

480
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:42,248
Good afternoon.

481
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:44,450
I'm here today
to share with you all

482
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:47,954
my vision for the economic
future of Southern Indiana,

483
00:16:47,988 --> 00:16:51,991
but first, Leslie Knope,
my wife...

484
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:53,192
has a brief statement.

485
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:54,226
Hello, everyone.

486
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:55,361
Thank you. Wow.

487
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:57,296
How about this weather
we're having?

488
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,731
Very temperate.

489
00:16:58,765 --> 00:16:59,732
Okay.

490
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,767
Recently,
I made an attempt to--

491
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:03,302
Actually, hang on. Stop.

492
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:07,473
I'm sorry. This whole thing
just makes me queasy

493
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:11,077
I love how independent
my wife is,

494
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:14,113
and because of that,
I will not let her speak.

495
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:15,581
That came out wrong.

496
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:19,118
The point is
Leslie is a great mother,

497
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:21,954
public servant,
all-around person,

498
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:25,391
and I am tired of everybody
constantly telling her

499
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:27,560
that she's making
the wrong choice.

500
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:30,596
So you can say
whatever you want.

501
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:33,265
I couldn't care less about
the political consequences.

502
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:36,302
Thank you, Ben.

503
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:38,671
Well, the first thing
I'm gonna do is say sorry.

504
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:42,641
I'm sorry that the spotlight
is on me and not on Ben,

505
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:45,611
because he is going to make
a great congressman.

506
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:47,179
Second, the Male Men.

507
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:48,547
Where are you? Ah!

508
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:50,549
You're ridiculous,
and men's rights is nothing.

509
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,952
Third, I'm now gonna give you
permanent answers

510
00:17:52,986 --> 00:17:55,554
to all the silly questions that
you're gonna end up asking me

511
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:57,890
and every other woman in this
election over the next few months.

512
00:17:57,924 --> 00:17:59,725
Why did I change my hairstyle?

513
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,961
Well, I don't know, I just
thought it would look better.

514
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:03,796
Or my kids got gum in it.

515
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,398
Are you trying to have it all?

516
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:07,767
That question makes no sense.
It's a stupid question.

517
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,302
Stop asking it.
Don't ask it.

518
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:10,970
Do you miss your kids
while you're at work?

519
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:12,638
Yes, of course I do.

520
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:14,040
Everybody does.

521
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:16,475
And then, you know,
sometimes I don't.

522
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,878
Yeah, and by the way, no one's
ever asked me that question.

523
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:20,780
No one asks me,
"Where are your kids?"

524
00:18:20,814 --> 00:18:22,114
Or "Who's taking care
of them?"

525
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:24,083
By the way, who is taking care
of the kids right now?

526
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:25,217
My mom, babe.
Everything's fine.

527
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:26,219
Right.

528
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:27,653
So maybe Leslie doesn't fit

529
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:30,723
your personal idea of what
a candidate's wife should be.

530
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:32,291
So what?

531
00:18:32,326 --> 00:18:34,060
That's good,
because there shouldn't be

532
00:18:34,094 --> 00:18:35,227
just one idea anyway.

533
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:36,395
That's right.

534
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,763
If you want to bake a pie,
that's great.

535
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:39,465
If you want to have a career,
that's great too.

536
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:41,667
Do both or neither.
It doesn't matter.

537
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:44,637
Just don't judge what
someone else has decided to do.

538
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:47,139
I mean, we're all just trying
to find the right path for us

539
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:50,810
as individuals on this Earth.

540
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:52,478
[sighs]

541
00:18:52,512 --> 00:18:55,981
[booing, cheers, and applause]

542
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:58,217
I'd say that's 50/50
boos and cheers.

543
00:18:58,251 --> 00:18:59,418
Yeah, that seems about right.

544
00:18:59,453 --> 00:19:02,455
Let Ben speak!
Let Ben speak!

545
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:03,422
He just spoke.

546
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:05,391
Oh. Sorry.
I-I just got here.

547
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:06,659
I had a broken bike chain.

548
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:07,927
My bad.

549
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,333
So I guess we are celebrating

550
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:15,256
that you trusted me
and I let you down.

551
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,391
Great.

552
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:19,694
I change my house locks
every 16 days.

553
00:19:19,728 --> 00:19:21,229
That key has been useless

554
00:19:21,263 --> 00:19:24,766
since the second Tuesday
after I gave it to you.

555
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,202
What matters is that I trust you

556
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:29,771
and admire you as a person.

557
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:32,774
I will be sorry
to see you leave this town

558
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:35,343
for many reasons...

559
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:36,811
not the least of which

560
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:40,515
is that you created a puzzle
that even I couldn't solve.

561
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:45,053
And boy, oh, boy,
did you love Andy.

562
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,788
[laughs]

563
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:49,424
"Woof, woof."
[laughs]

564
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,292
It really is embarrassing.

565
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:53,394
Oh, my God.
I totally know where the key is.

566
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:56,064
[shovel scraping]

567
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:57,632
[clanking]

568
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,969
[laughing]

569
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:03,271
How'd you remember?

570
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:05,740
"Woof, woof."

571
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:06,975
Bark.

572
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:09,244
Why here?

573
00:20:10,913 --> 00:20:13,281
Because this tree
reminds me of you.

574
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:16,383
It's strong and quiet

575
00:20:17,094 --> 00:20:19,090
and always here when you need it...

576
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:22,072
or whatever.

577
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,838
(Ron) I have always felt a
certain kinship with April,

578
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:27,353
and this is proof
that I was correct--

579
00:20:27,913 --> 00:20:30,048
not the nice things
she said about me,

580
00:20:30,082 --> 00:20:32,517
the fact that I buried
a large amount of gold

581
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:34,619
under that same tree years ago.

582
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:38,623
I've since moved it.

583
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:40,558
Or have I?

584
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:42,327
[knock at door]

585
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:43,795
- Elise.
- Oh...

586
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:45,363
What did I do wrong now?

587
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:47,865
No, actually,
we at the I.O.W.

588
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,567
loved what you said
in your speech.

589
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:50,835
Really?

590
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:54,405
But what we loved even more
was how you, Ben,

591
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,709
gave Leslie a platform
in which to speak her mind.

592
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:01,014
Congratulations, Ben Wyatt.

593
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,449
You are this year's I.O.W.
Woman of the Year.

594
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:06,069
Son of a bitch.

595
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:12,129
