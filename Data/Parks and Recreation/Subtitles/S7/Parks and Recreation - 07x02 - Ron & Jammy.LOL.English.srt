1
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:06,079
Knopey, my girl, what up?

2
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:07,914
- I just farted.
- Oh, Jeremy.

3
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:09,482
I truly thought that
I would never have

4
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:10,517
to interact with you again.

5
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:11,684
I missed you too.

6
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:13,153
The city council is voting

7
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:14,120
on whether to rezone

8
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:16,089
the Newport land
for commercial use.

9
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:19,381
If I win, stupid Gryzzl
and stupid Ron

10
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:21,850
can't build anything there,
and then I'm sitting pretty.

11
00:00:21,884 --> 00:00:26,555
Sadly, the deciding vote
is from my old city council mate

12
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:31,359
and human equivalent of
gas station Sushi, Jeremy Jamm.

13
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:34,429
So I am here to talk to you
about why you should vote "No"

14
00:00:34,463 --> 00:00:35,830
- in the zoning issue--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:37,165
Hold up, little chica.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,835
Before we go any further,
I need to ask my girlfriend

17
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:40,936
how she wants me to vote.

18
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,405
Why?
Who's your girlfriend?

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,274
Hello, Leslie.

20
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:47,342
Tammy!

21
00:00:50,313 --> 00:01:00,710
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

22
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:10,432
Wow, Jamm and Tammy.
Jammy.

23
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:12,134
Jammy.

24
00:01:12,168 --> 00:01:13,935
You guys are so cute.
When did you--

25
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,572
why would either one of you,
uh, you know, why?

26
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:18,707
Dear God, why?

27
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:20,876
Hit it off at karaoke.

28
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,345
She saw me nail
<i>Gangsta's Paradise.</i>

29
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:25,280
I saw her bite the door guy...

30
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:28,183
She then let me buy her
a bunch of purses,

31
00:01:28,217 --> 00:01:30,352
- and the rest is history.
- A bunch.

32
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:32,053
Wait a second,
this is great news,

33
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:34,289
because Ron is my opponent
in this,

34
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:36,424
and you live to torture Ron.

35
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:37,426
Vote for me

36
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,994
so that you can screw Ron over.

37
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:41,062
Maybe you're not
a blonde bimbo after all.

38
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:43,131
- Thank you.
- Well, let me mull it over.

39
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,500
Sure, I'm aligning myself
with terrible people,

40
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:48,069
but think
of all the wonderful people

41
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:50,105
who will benefit
from a national park!

42
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:52,641
It's worth it,
and you can trust my opinion

43
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:54,843
because I have a lot to gain
by being right,

44
00:01:54,877 --> 00:01:57,979
and I have severe tunnel vision
about achieving my goals.

45
00:01:58,014 --> 00:02:01,316
Joan, on behalf of the entire
city, congratulations.

46
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,985
I do want to apologize for not
being able to accommodate

47
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,287
- some of your requests.
- Oh.

48
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:07,455
For example,
we couldn't get a bottle

49
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,392
of Chateau Marmont
because it's a hotel

50
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:12,527
in Los Angeles, not a wine.

51
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:15,030
Well, did you at least get
buddy holly to sing?

52
00:02:15,064 --> 00:02:19,367
No, because he's been
famously dead for 60 years.

53
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:21,002
- What?
- Hi, Joan.

54
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:23,305
Hi, my name is April,
and I'm your biggest fan,

55
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:24,439
- and I pretty much hate everyone.
- Oh.

56
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:26,308
Will you sign
your ninth memoir for me?

57
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:28,577
Well, it would be my pleasure.

58
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:29,878
You said your name was Glenn?

59
00:02:29,912 --> 00:02:32,914
- Yes, I did.
- That's pretty.

60
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:34,916
Joan has always been
kind of a train wreck,

61
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:38,253
but the last three years,
she's gone off the deep end.

62
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:40,555
She did a string of shows
from rehab.

63
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,792
Victoria Herzog,
you were a successful attorney

64
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:44,759
from Wilmington, Delaware.

65
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:46,261
Then you hit rock bottom.

66
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:47,963
This is supposed to be
anonymous.

67
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:50,565
She once gave every member
in her audience a car.

68
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,201
One car, that they all
had to fight for.

69
00:02:53,236 --> 00:02:54,936
Oh, and last year she did a show

70
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:56,572
where she called
all of her ex-boyfriends

71
00:02:56,606 --> 00:02:58,106
while sitting
on a washing machine.

72
00:02:58,141 --> 00:02:59,875
Well, Erik,
if you didn't give it to me,

73
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,176
then who did?

74
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,078
I love her so much.

75
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:05,847
I hope she's my real mom.

76
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:08,083
"Entrepreneur-bachelor
Tom Haverford

77
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:10,919
"is making quite a splash
in the culinary world.

78
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:15,090
We expect even bigger things
from him in 2018."

79
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:18,160
Tom, what does "culinary" mean?

80
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:19,628
Means this is a cause
for celebration.

81
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:21,696
Round of drinks for everyone
on the house.

82
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:22,764
Yeah!

83
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:24,199
Oh, let me also get
a chicken parm

84
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:25,300
and a lasagna on the side.

85
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:27,803
And a spaghetti to go.
On the house!

86
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:30,205
Yes.

87
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:32,674
That's the fourth engagement
this month.

88
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,043
I'm tired of being
an entrepreneur/bachelor.

89
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:37,012
I need to find someone.

90
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:39,147
Are you bummed, Tom?

91
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:40,649
Hey, I got a quick fix for that.

92
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,551
Let's get hammered.

93
00:03:42,585 --> 00:03:44,719
Everything here is free.

94
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:46,888
Ron.

95
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:50,959
Ms. Knope.
How's that $0 bid coming along?

96
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:53,195
You know, in my experience
with capitalism,

97
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:55,564
people normally expect money
in exchange

98
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:57,032
for their goods and land.

99
00:03:57,066 --> 00:04:00,435
In my experience
with buttfaces, you are one.

100
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:04,072
We will now hear arguments
about the Newport property.

101
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:07,409
First, on behalf of Gryzzl,
Mr. Ron Swanson.

102
00:04:07,443 --> 00:04:09,211
Thank you, councilman.

103
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:12,447
When you vote tomorrow,
we believe you should vote

104
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:15,250
to rezone the land
for commercial use.

105
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:18,286
Well, I'm convinced.
Tomorrow I'm voting for Gryzzl.

106
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:19,454
What?

107
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,423
I didn't even get a chance
to say my plan.

108
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:23,225
Your plan?

109
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:24,593
You know who else had a plan?

110
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:25,760
Please don't say Hitler.

111
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:28,230
Adolf Hitler.

112
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:29,698
I'm with Swanson.

113
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:31,933
It's a stache thing.
Stache bros.

114
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:33,568
You wouldn't understand.

115
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:35,937
We're done here.

116
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,306
Well, that was easy.

117
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:39,875
What the hell just happened?

118
00:04:40,977 --> 00:04:42,410
Thank you, Commissioner Gordon,

119
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:43,478
people of Gotham.

120
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:45,547
Okay, she thinks
she's in <i>Batman.</i>

121
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:48,550
People often ask me,
"Joan, how do you do it?"

122
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:50,452
It's simple.

123
00:04:50,486 --> 00:04:52,153
I love being on TV.

124
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:53,889
I've known
what I've wanted to do

125
00:04:53,923 --> 00:04:55,424
since I was ten years old.

126
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,560
That is the key
to living a good life.

127
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:02,631
If you don't absolutely love
what you do with a true passion,

128
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:04,766
then what's the point
in doing it at all?

129
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:06,201
On a separate note,

130
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:08,270
I think that America
should have a purge night.

131
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:10,639
Let me explain why.

132
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:13,875
Do I even like my job?

133
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,711
I must be the first person ever

134
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:20,148
to have money, power,
and notoriety

135
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:22,784
but still feel empty.

136
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:24,553
I need someone to share
my life with.

137
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:28,924
What if your future wife is
somebody that you already know?

138
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,860
Let's open your Gryzzl page.

139
00:05:31,894 --> 00:05:33,094
What about her?
She's cute.

140
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:34,996
- Date her.
- That's my cousin.

141
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:36,631
Oh. How about her?

142
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,186
That's my dad!
What's wrong with you?

143
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:39,234
I'm drunk, okay?

144
00:05:39,268 --> 00:05:41,069
Why are you only friends
with your family?

145
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:42,137
Ooh, look,
you just got a message

146
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:44,139
from somebody named Lucy
in Chicago.

147
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:45,307
She looks familiar.

148
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,008
Yeah, we used to date.
I was super into her.

149
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:50,745
No, that's not it.
Was she in Destiny's Child?

150
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,982
"Hey, Tom.
Saw the article, you boss!

151
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:56,518
Let's catch up soon.
Miss you."

152
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:59,120
Do you realize what's happening?

153
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:00,489
We have been sitting here

154
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:01,756
searching for your soul mate
this whole time,

155
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,792
and then Lucy just
Gryzzl-texts you out of nowhere?

156
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:05,227
It's a sign,
and we have to catch it.

157
00:06:05,261 --> 00:06:07,996
We are going to Chicago.

158
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,533
Andy, think about what
you're saying right now,

159
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,835
'cause it's the smartest idea
anyone's ever had.

160
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,904
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

161
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:18,173
Ron, what did you do?

162
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:20,542
I delivered
a flawless presentation

163
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,344
and secured tomorrow's vote.

164
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:24,813
No, you got all sneaky
and snuck around

165
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:26,214
and snooked that vote away
from me.

166
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:29,651
And I know this because earlier
I sneaked and snooked around,

167
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:31,553
and Jammy was supposed
to vote for me.

168
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:34,122
The snooker has become
the snorked.

169
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:37,793
What are you talking--

170
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:39,461
She's near.

171
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:40,896
Hey, Ron.

172
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,030
Tammy.

173
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:43,598
So you two are together now.

174
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:46,334
- My condolences to both of you.
- Mm.

175
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:47,469
You guys
were supposed to vote for me.

176
00:06:47,503 --> 00:06:50,205
Leslie, I would never
do anything to help you.

177
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:52,007
You've always been
against me and Ron.

178
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,209
You're a big part of the reason
that he and I aren't together

179
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:56,378
and I had to settle
for this placeholder.

180
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:58,179
I love you so much.

181
00:06:58,214 --> 00:07:00,048
So you thought
if you voted for Ron,

182
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:01,683
you could actually win him back?

183
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:02,851
Yeah, that's right.

184
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:04,286
Did it work, baby?

185
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,055
Are you horny with gratitude?

186
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:11,460
You two more than deserve
each other.

187
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:14,096
Good luck.

188
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,697
The vote is tomorrow.

189
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:18,099
If I don't get Jamm
out from Tammy's clutches,

190
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:19,301
I'm doomed!

191
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:21,369
It's like rescuing a bunny
from a lion,

192
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:24,200
but that lion is
a demonic sociopath

193
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,907
with really nice cleavage.

194
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:30,374
All right, we're here.

195
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,975
Sir, where the hell are we?

196
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,243
Chicago.

197
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:35,412
That'll be $830.

198
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:36,446
Oh, no.

199
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:38,282
- This is so dumb.
- Awesome!

200
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:40,076
Turn the car around.
We're going back home.

201
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,118
No way.
Pay me.

202
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:42,586
And get the hell out of my cab.

203
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,555
Pay the man.

204
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,424
Chicago!

205
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:49,193
The Big Apple!

206
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:51,261
- Well, that's where Lucy works.
- Yeah.

207
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:52,763
Must have given the cabbie
the address.

208
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:54,298
Let's just get something to eat
and fly home.

209
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:56,066
What? No!
We came all this way.

210
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,501
Tom, we should at least say hi.

211
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:59,703
No. You can't not talk to
someone for five years and then

212
00:07:59,737 --> 00:08:02,439
show up unannounced where
they work in a different city.

213
00:08:02,474 --> 00:08:04,408
That's what murderers do
before they murder someone.

214
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,509
Tom?

215
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:07,077
I thought that was you.
What are you doing here?

216
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,879
Oh, uh--

217
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:10,781
You're not going
to murder me, are you?

218
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:15,819
No.
I'm here doing stuff, um--

219
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:17,921
Lucy, hey.
Andy Dwyer.

220
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,423
- Remember me?
- Yeah.

221
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,492
He's here helping me
find a place to live.

222
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:23,093
I just got a job here,

223
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,695
and then when you hit him up
on Gryzzl,

224
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:26,463
he was like,
"Let's go say hi to Lucy

225
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:28,832
since we're already here
in Chicago."

226
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,200
Yeah.
That's the deal.

227
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:31,568
Cool.
What job is it?

228
00:08:31,603 --> 00:08:33,604
Head coach of the Chicago Bulls.

229
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,606
No, he's, uh,
working at a nonprofit.

230
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,574
No, what?
Am I?

231
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:39,042
Aw, that sucks.

232
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:40,511
Well, um, listen,
I got some stuff I got to do

233
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:42,179
in the office,
but I want to hang out.

234
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:43,547
Do you want to meet me here
in, like, an hour?

235
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,082
Yeah.
That sounds great.

236
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:46,083
We'll, uh, got get a little

237
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:47,518
Chicago deep dish pizza

238
00:08:47,552 --> 00:08:49,052
- and go watch the Bears.
- No.

239
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:50,721
I'm sorry I started doing that.

240
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,092
Hey, April.
How's it going?

241
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:56,226
Fine.

242
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:58,529
Except hearing Joan
talk about her passion

243
00:08:58,563 --> 00:08:59,763
and doing what you really love,

244
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:01,198
like, totally freaked me out.

245
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:03,200
Eight years ago,
I accepted a random internship

246
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:04,368
at the Parks Department,

247
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:06,203
and then Leslie told me
to do a bunch of stuff,

248
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:08,772
and now I'm executive director
of regional whatever--

249
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,140
I don't even know what it means,

250
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,576
and I never even asked myself
if I even really like it.

251
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,511
I mean, it's like
what is my purpose in life?

252
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:17,214
What do I even care about?

253
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:18,549
My insides are dying.

254
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,051
So, not fine.

255
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:22,753
I don't know what to do.
I have to quit.

256
00:09:22,787 --> 00:09:23,954
To do what?

257
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:25,556
I'm just gonna go
live under a bridge

258
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,990
and ask people riddles
before they cross.

259
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,125
Okay, hold on.

260
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,960
Do you remember what Joan said
at the ceremony?

261
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:31,562
That is doesn't count
as stripping

262
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:32,830
if no one pays you?

263
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,798
Yes, she did say that, but no.

264
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,534
She knew she wanted to be on TV
when she was ten.

265
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:40,604
So what did you want to be
when you were ten?

266
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,309
It says here
the future of caskets

267
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:47,845
may just be
biodegradable plastic.

268
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,847
Oh, you don't say.
Hey, are you chilly?

269
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:50,948
I'm a little chilly, I think.

270
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:52,649
- No.
- Hey, guys.

271
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:54,451
Welcome.
I'm Dan.

272
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:56,253
Hi, I'm Ben.
This is April.

273
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:58,288
And I'm scared of death.

274
00:09:58,323 --> 00:10:01,191
I'm just really interested
in learning what you do.

275
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,292
You're gonna love it here.

276
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:05,329
People are dying to get in.

277
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:06,497
Come on, come on.

278
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:09,466
We'll start
down at the cadaver chute.

279
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:12,236
The cadaver chute.
Come on!

280
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,971
So this is where
you want to eat lunch?

281
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:15,205
In a steakhouse?

282
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,074
Don't you have
irritable bowel syndrome?

283
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:18,408
God, I hate that I know that.

284
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:20,244
Yeah, it's murder
on the old plumbing,

285
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:23,814
but, uh, Tammy only wants me
to eat steak and whiskey.

286
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:26,784
She has my stool analyzed
just to keep me honest.

287
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:28,919
I don't think this
relationship is that healthy.

288
00:10:28,953 --> 00:10:32,089
I mean, it seems like Tammy
is trying to turn you into Ron,

289
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:34,558
and you're Jeremy Jamm,
I mean, come on.

290
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,960
You love Porsches
and spiked iced tea,

291
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:38,762
and you have
a Hooters platinum card.

292
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:41,098
Yeah, Tammy doesn't really
let me do that stuff anymore.

293
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:43,400
But, uh, you know, it's good,
you know?

294
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,535
I'm better now.

295
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:46,003
I mean, sure, I'm depressed,

296
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:48,305
and, uh, I'm constantly sick,

297
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,040
and nothing
really brings me joy,

298
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:52,209
but it just feels right.

299
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:55,512
Oh, God.

300
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:57,881
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, help me, Knope.

301
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,550
Oh, I used to be so great.

302
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:01,251
Remember?
Everybody thought so.

303
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,853
Well--

304
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:04,288
- Oh, God.
- Wow.

305
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:06,557
This is worse than I thought.

306
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:09,393
You're broken.
She has broken you.

307
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:11,228
You need to get away from her.

308
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:12,542
Oh, God. Whoa, hey.
Look at that.

309
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:17,301
More hair came out.

310
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:22,378
Yeah, I think you're really
going to like it here.

311
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:24,341
And obviously everyone's
in a really great mood now

312
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:25,909
because of the Cubs
winning the series.

313
00:11:25,944 --> 00:11:27,211
Yeah, it seems really nice.

314
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:29,179
I mean, I am gonna miss
Pawnee, though.

315
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:31,181
My wife's there,
for crying out loud.

316
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:32,337
Yeah, tell me about Pawnee.

317
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,711
It sounds like
it's really changed.

318
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:35,438
Oh, yeah.
There's a ton of new businesses.

319
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:36,687
Gryzzl came in.

320
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:39,757
They gave everyone free tablets
and wi-fi and phones.

321
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,226
You can watch<i> Hitch 2</i>
anytime, anywhere.

322
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,894
Finally, that's the dream.

323
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:45,996
Part of me wants
to go back, you know?

324
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,831
I always kind of liked it there.

325
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:50,434
Man, you got me
really missing Pawnee now.

326
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:53,137
I don't know what to do.
Am I making the right decision?

327
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,141
Hey.

328
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,510
- Why are you here?
- I'm calling a temporary truce.

329
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,412
You need to help me
break up Jamm and Tammy.

330
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:02,813
Forget it.

331
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,848
You just want Jamm
to switch his vote.

332
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:07,017
What is this,
revenge for Morningstar?

333
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:08,519
No, it is not about that.

334
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:09,820
It is not about the vote.

335
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,488
There is a guy in real trouble,

336
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,856
and you might be
the only one who can help him.

337
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:14,558
This is
about saving someone's soul.

338
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:17,561
He is a monster.
Monsters do not have souls.

339
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:19,630
Uh, have you ever seen
<i>Monsters, Inc.?</i>

340
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:21,265
- No.
- Damn it, Ron.

341
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:23,033
Engage in the culture
once in a while.

342
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:24,935
Jamm, get in here.

343
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:31,342
Good God, man.
What happened to you?

344
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,810
Tammy happened to him!

345
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:34,845
Remind you of anyone, Ron?

346
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,580
We need to put our issues aside

347
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:39,917
and defend
this miserable person.

348
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:42,319
Jeremy, this is a gold bar.

349
00:12:42,353 --> 00:12:43,487
You keep that in your desk?

350
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:45,356
I will give you this gold bar

351
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,659
if you say one
unflattering thing about Tammy.

352
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:51,462
If I do...

353
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:53,263
does Tammy get to keep the gold?

354
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:54,465
Oh, my God.

355
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:55,933
When it comes to Tammy,

356
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,302
the code is the same as that
of the battlefield:

357
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:00,370
First, you leave no man behind.

358
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,105
Second, you must
protect yourself

359
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,775
against chemical warfare.

360
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:08,145
Tammy does not abide
by the Geneva convention.

361
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,891
I made
this Tammy de-programming kit

362
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,466
in case I ever fell victim
to her again.

363
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,688
First, this is a chastity belt
that I made by hand.

364
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:19,690
It might be a couple sizes
too big for you,

365
00:13:19,724 --> 00:13:21,625
but you can just pad it.

366
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,328
The first step
is to cut out all sex.

367
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:25,629
That won't be necessary.

368
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:26,897
We haven't done the deed yet.

369
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,700
She lets me rub up
against her leg sometimes.

370
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:31,268
Well, all the more reason
to wear it.

371
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:33,537
She knows she has that card
left to play,

372
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:35,372
and you best believe she will.

373
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:37,441
We're also gonna try
a Pavlovian technique.

374
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:41,045
Ron is holding
Tammy's perfume, Girth.

375
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,179
Oh.

376
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:44,915
Oh, smells good.
Oh!

377
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,350
Again.

378
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:47,751
Tammy.
Oh!

379
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,220
How many times
are we gonna do this?

380
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:50,888
Until the bottle is empty.
Again.

381
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:52,089
Twice.

382
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,290
Tam--
Ahh!

383
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:54,291
Ahh!

384
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:56,227
It's going well so far,

385
00:13:56,261 --> 00:14:00,831
but it's too early to tell.

386
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,666
- Oh.
- He was pretty far gone.

387
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:06,504
Hopefully we get
a body in today,

388
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:09,373
so I can show you guys
the really fun part:

389
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,474
Draining.

390
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:11,842
Oh, God.
I hate this so much.

391
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:13,410
Cool.
Can I touch a dead body?

392
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:15,179
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, eager beaver.

393
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:17,281
That doesn't happen
for at least a year.

394
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,983
Why?
How did you become a mortician?

395
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:20,217
Can't I just sign up?

396
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:21,352
Oh, gosh, no.

397
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:22,753
You need two years of school

398
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:24,054
and a year-long apprenticeship.

399
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:27,625
First few years
are mostly paperwork and filing.

400
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,194
Ugh! Why is every job
just paperwork?

401
00:14:30,228 --> 00:14:32,463
Hey, it's a living.

402
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,298
Yeah, I think
we're just gonna go, Dan.

403
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,368
Um, the reality of your life
is incredibly depressing.

404
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:38,903
I'm just gonna stay
at my current job

405
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:41,505
until I get old and die
and then end up here

406
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,873
being embalmed by some weirdo

407
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:44,508
who had to go to school
for three years

408
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:46,210
just to cut my guts open.

409
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:48,245
- Let's go.
- Oh, thank God.

410
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,681
Okay.
Have a good one.

411
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:52,249
Okay, we're gonna do some scenes

412
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:54,718
and demonstrate ways
that you can resist Tammy.

413
00:14:54,753 --> 00:14:57,154
I will play Tammy.
Ron will play you.

414
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,190
Hey there, horsey.

415
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:02,193
Time to mount up
and ride on into Bonertown.

416
00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:05,763
What do you say we get stanky
in that pet store bathroom?

417
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:08,332
- Huh, Jamm? Hmm? Huh? Huh?
- Do it.

418
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,201
There will be
no sex today, Tammy.

419
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:11,469
Oh.

420
00:15:11,503 --> 00:15:13,370
Instead, why don't you go
into the pet store

421
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:15,272
and feed yourself to the snakes?

422
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:18,209
To hell with you, woman.
Good-bye.

423
00:15:18,243 --> 00:15:19,777
Hey, you big hunk
of wiener meat.

424
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:23,013
I've got 40 handtowels,
some energy bars,

425
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,849
and a Chinese finger trap.

426
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,550
Let's get gross.

427
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:28,252
This gambit has failed.

428
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:30,588
To hell with you, woman.
Good-bye.

429
00:15:30,622 --> 00:15:31,722
What are you wearing?

430
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,691
It's a crotch-blinder
of my own design.

431
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:37,261
In this scenario, she will be
coming at you pants-less.

432
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:38,696
Okay.

433
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,898
Doors are locked.
Window is secured.

434
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:43,234
There is no way
Tammy's getting in here.

435
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:44,568
Jamm.

436
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:47,171
Strip down, you sex maggot.

437
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:48,906
And hold!

438
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,074
What was your mistake?

439
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:52,676
You didn't check the armoire.

440
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,645
Tammy once camped out
in my attic

441
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:57,148
for six days
awaiting my arrival.

442
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,550
She survived on rats
and rainwater.

443
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,919
Let's run it again!

444
00:16:01,953 --> 00:16:03,953
I gotta say, hanging out
with Lucy's been so fun.

445
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:05,122
She's the best.

446
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:07,057
And I love
that she's buying us stuff.

447
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,826
Dude, make your move.
Ask her out.

448
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,194
I don't know.
She lives here.

449
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:12,997
- How would it even work?
- Life is about taking risks.

450
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:15,432
Look at me, Tom.
I'm moving to Chicago.

451
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:16,967
It's just us right now.

452
00:16:17,002 --> 00:16:18,269
Do you really think
you're moving here?

453
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:20,171
One double XL, one kid's XL.

454
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:22,073
- Hey, you remembered my size.
- Yeah.

455
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,707
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

456
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:25,276
Hey, Lucy,
can I ask you something?

457
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,277
Of course.
What's up?

458
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:27,244
I was wondering,

459
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,115
would you want to maybe...

460
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:32,616
come work for me in Pawnee?

461
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:35,886
I have the company,
and it's growing so fast.

462
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:37,888
I can't do it all myself,
and I need a manager,

463
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:39,423
and you're a perfect candidate.

464
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,625
Wow.
Really?

465
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,428
That does sound kind of awesome.

466
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,430
And it'd be super fun
to work with you.

467
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,999
I mean, I have to talk to my
boyfriend about it first, but...

468
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:50,935
Yeah, of course!

469
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,269
This is all perfect,

470
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,205
and everything's worked out
just as I'd hoped.

471
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,476
Hey, this is why
they call it Beantown, huh?

472
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:01,445
Hey, Jere-bear.

473
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,714
What are you doing
with these two jabronis?

474
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:06,650
Tammy, I've given this
a lot of thought.

475
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:08,385
We should break up.

476
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:12,489
What's the matter, little boy?

477
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,592
Did the bad people get to you?

478
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:17,595
They just made me realize how
unhealthy this is, literally.

479
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:19,964
All the steak and whiskey--
I have to wear a diaper.

480
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,266
That's 'cause
you're my widdle baby.

481
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,501
We drilled you on this, Jamm.

482
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:24,768
Baby talk, what do you do?

483
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:27,538
I'm not a baby.
I'm a big boy!

484
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:29,807
Yeah, okay. That--
well, that wasn't terrible.

485
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,643
Don't listen to Leslie.
She's trying to manipulate you.

486
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,979
All she cares about is herself,
and I can prove it.

487
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,047
How's this, Leslie?

488
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:40,351
You leave us alone,
and we swing the vote to you?

489
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:44,121
Help you get your park.

490
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:45,856
No. Nice try.

491
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:47,725
Stay strong, Jeremy.

492
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,460
- It's over, Tammy.
- Tell you what.

493
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:51,495
It's been long enough.

494
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,599
What do you say we
consummate our relationship...

495
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:57,234
tonight?

496
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:59,970
Huh?
Let's do it.

497
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:04,041
And the last card is played.

498
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:06,811
- What are you doing?
- Shh! This is a library.

499
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:08,045
Do you see
what's happening here?

500
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,947
Ron, I need
that crotch-blinder.

501
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:12,950
No, you don't.
Just end it.

502
00:18:13,985 --> 00:18:15,085
- Look at my boobs.
- No.

503
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,287
- Look downstairs.
- No.

504
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:17,521
There's a prize inside for you.

505
00:18:17,522 --> 00:18:18,489
It's over, Tammy.

506
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:19,557
What?

507
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:22,693
To hell with you, woman.
Good-bye.

508
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:26,230
How dare you?
Are you kidding me?

509
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:28,466
You'll be back!
They all come back!

510
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,568
Well done, Jeremy.

511
00:18:30,602 --> 00:18:33,737
Turns out the crotch-blinder
was inside you all along.

512
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:36,187
Everybody,
who wants to get it on?

513
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:37,384
I'm naked!

514
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:40,835
Donna, what do I do?

515
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,137
If working around corpses
isn't even right for me,

516
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:44,872
then nothing is.

517
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:47,441
I feel totally lost.

518
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:49,744
- Saturn's return.
- What?

519
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:53,080
Saturn's orbit around the sun
takes roughly 29 years,

520
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:55,149
and when it gets back to where
it was when you were born,

521
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:57,552
lots of turmoil,
self-discovery.

522
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:58,686
When I was your age,

523
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,855
I got banned
from every riverboat in Germany.

524
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,124
Donna, April,
what are you up to?

525
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:05,660
Oh, you know,
just regionally directing

526
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:07,461
the Midwest whatever
of who cares.

527
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:08,563
Oh, isn't it great?

528
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:10,832
Can you believe
that they pay me for this?

529
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:13,034
Because I would do this
for free.

530
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,002
Aw, jeez!

531
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:18,506
I do miss you, Terry.

532
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,041
Let me get you some napkins.

533
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,544
April, you looked
at one horrifying job.

534
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,012
I've got a few more ideas.

535
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,881
We'll find you
something you like, okay?

536
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,449
Okay.

537
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:30,151
But you can't tell Leslie
I might leave.

538
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:31,986
She'll have a heart attack.
Promise?

539
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,187
I promise.

540
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:34,789
Why are you
so into helping me right now?

541
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:37,358
Because I'm finally doing
what I love,

542
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:39,660
and I know how hard it is
to get to that place.

543
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:44,332
And I want you to be happy
because you're my friend.

544
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:47,835
No, I'm not.
I've never cared for you.

545
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:54,175
Wait, wait.

546
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:58,045
You're behaving very strangely.

547
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,981
Saturn's return.

548
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,582
Hey, Brokemons.

549
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,817
I just wanted to let you know

550
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:05,419
that I will be abstaining
from the vote today.

551
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,588
You are
my two all-time best friends,

552
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,890
and you brought me back
from the brink,

553
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,058
so I can't choose sides.

554
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:13,694
Although if I had to pick
one side, it would be

555
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:15,830
Lucy Liu's backside.

556
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,569
Without Jamm,
the vote's two-two.

557
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:23,538
This was all for nothing.

558
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,006
I thought it was very big of you

559
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,102
to not bend when Tammy
promised you the vote.

560
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:30,907
Well, I thought it was very big
of you to help him at all.

561
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:32,942
You didn't have to do that.

562
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,570
Okay, back to work to figure out
how to destroy you.

563
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:38,684
Same. Good bye.

564
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:43,144
Dude, thank you so much for this.
I really owe you one.

565
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:44,029
No, you don't.

566
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,750
You're smart and qualified
and we're totally lucky to have you.

567
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:48,058
Okay, let's do this.

568
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:51,899
Still don't know what claiming
allowances means. I always put 6.

569
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:55,097
- So far so good.
- Dude, you are totally going to jail.

570
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:57,947
This couldn't have worked out any better.

571
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,054
There was a guy eating lunch in here
who didn't finish his spaghetti.

572
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,951
Oh, also, Tom and Lucy
are totally going to fall in love!

573
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,641
Five second rule!

574
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:12,183
