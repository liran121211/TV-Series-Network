1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,336
So, gentlemen, you have evidence

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:05,971
that the Newport land
should be preserved.

3
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:07,506
Absolutely.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,708
You see, I'm a ninth level
Octopriest

5
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:11,577
in the Church
of the Reasonableists.

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,544
Oh, boy.

7
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,314
The land is sacred
in our religion.

8
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,350
Because it's the place where all
human souls will be transmuted

9
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,285
when Zorpe the Lizard God
passes through

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,154
Jupiter's sphincter.

11
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,256
- Hail, Zorpe.
- Hail, Zorpe!

12
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,825
I'm looking for anything
to strengthen my case

13
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,961
that the Newport land should
become a park,

14
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,429
and not a corpate campus.

15
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,764
Religious reasons,
animal conservation,

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,932
historical significance.

17
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:34,967
Anything.

18
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,236
So hold on to your straws,
everybody.

19
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,638
'cause Mama's going graspin'.

20
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,875
In 1980, there were more
than 600 million

21
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,944
Indiana brown ants
in that forest.

22
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:50,182
Today, there are only
595 million.

23
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,186
At that rate, they'll all be
gone by the year 2030.

24
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,322
- 60.
- 200 and 3,060?

25
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,691
- 200,000 years from now?
- Yes.

26
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,760
That doesn't seem like
an immediate crisis.

27
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,762
I got a different idea
for that land.

28
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,498
An amusement park
with rides and food

29
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,367
and sexy cartoon characters.

30
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,770
- I call it Disneyland.
- How did you get in here?

31
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,672
Broke a window.

32
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,714
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

33
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:36,374
Oh, hey, guys.
Come on in.

34
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:38,642
You guys, I am Roscoe.

35
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:41,164
I am Vice President of
Cool New Shizz here at Gryzzl.

36
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:43,726
Feel free in this meeting
to break out your vapes

37
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,020
and just kick back.

38
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:46,288
Now, peep this.

39
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:48,224
Leslie Knope has been meeting
with people

40
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:50,292
to try to sexy-up
her presentation.

41
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:52,294
So we had this far-out
brain tornado.

42
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,662
Good idea.

43
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,665
We should get a brity to come
kick it with us small time,

44
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,400
and then just be like,
"Hey, chumps.

45
00:01:58,435 --> 00:01:59,401
Let's get tight with Gryzz."

46
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:00,836
We need a celebrity.

47
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,872
As a minority owner,
it'll strengthen Gryzzl's bid.

48
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:07,276
Is a celebrity necessary?
I prefer quality over flash.

49
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,079
That's why I refuse to write
my signature in cursive.

50
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,248
Celebrities can help
with this kind of thing.

51
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:14,483
The Nets wouldn't be in Brooklyn
if it weren't for Jay-Z.

52
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:16,852
And the sales for Chick-fil-A
went through the roof

53
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:17,887
once Elton John bought 'em.

54
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:18,921
Exactly.

55
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:20,623
Gryzzl is an outsider here
in Pawnee,

56
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:22,625
so a local celebrity
is gonna make everyone

57
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,293
feel more at ease with us.

58
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:26,529
And that's why we called on you
home court chillers

59
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,863
to frack your braniums.

60
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,466
Since we're locals, they want
us to think of ideas.

61
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,701
- I got it in context.
- Okay.

62
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,238
I have no interest
in consorting with celebrities.

63
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:38,908
The only celebrities I recognize
are furniture maker

64
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:41,610
Garry Knox Bennett,
designer of the notorious

65
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:44,813
16 Penny Nail Cabinet,
and Magnus,

66
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:48,350
the five-by-five bull elk I saw
near my cabin two years ago.

67
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:51,520
Took a shot at the bastard
and he stuck his antlers

68
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:53,422
through the door
of my meat shed.

69
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:57,259
One day, Magnus.
I will wear you as a jacket.

70
00:02:57,294 --> 00:03:01,130
Have you thought about this.
You could be an airline pilot.

71
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:04,500
- I don't like heights.
- What about a submarine pilot?

72
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06,769
- I don't like depths.
- Mm.

73
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:08,237
I don't like anything, okay.

74
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,505
You're not gonna be able
to find a career for me,

75
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:10,472
so just give up.

76
00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:12,341
No way, babe.
We can do this.

77
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,742
Let's play a game.
Okay?

78
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,445
You say a word, I say a word.
We see if it makes a profession.

79
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,848
- Executive.
- Trampoline.

80
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,450
- Computer.
- Trampoline.

81
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:23,686
- Trampoline.
- Pass.

82
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,054
Hey, Leslie?

83
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:28,190
I need both you and Ron to sign
this city point of sale document

84
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:30,926
since the land you're gunning
for lies within city limits.

85
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,928
Can we run over to Ron's office
and take care of this?

86
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,231
Well, I love it when you talk
point of sale doc,

87
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:37,266
'cause you know it turns me on,
but, no, no.

88
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,035
There's no way that I will be in
the same room with Ron Swanson,

89
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,972
unless it is during a police
lineup when I am pointing

90
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:44,573
him out as the man
who betrayed me.

91
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,509
That's him, officer.
Ronald Swanson.

92
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:47,910
Thank you, Leslie.

93
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,345
That's the fifth crime you've
solved this month.

94
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,113
I'm not supposed to do this,
but let me give you a badge

95
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,381
and a siren for your car.

96
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:54,450
Could you please focus?
It'll take two minutes.

97
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,019
And all signatures need to be
notarized, and I really don't

98
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:00,056
want to have to schedule two
different notary appointments.

99
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,993
Uh, not to eavesdrop,
but I have a crazy story.

100
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:05,795
I recently had a bit
of a health scare,

101
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,062
just a couple weeks
in the hospital.

102
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:09,832
Oh, God.
This story's terrible so far.

103
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,967
Anyway, I became really
motivated once I got out

104
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,837
to finally live life
to the fullest.

105
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:18,607
So...I fulfilled one of
my lifelong dreams.

106
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:20,843
And I became a notary public.

107
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:22,711
So if I go with you,
Ron and Leslie

108
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:23,979
can sign the document
separately.

109
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,915
Yeah, see?
Ben, it all works out.

110
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:29,151
I'll sign the documents here
and then you can bring it to Ron

111
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,020
and he can sign it there,
and then you can tell Ron

112
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:32,288
to rot in hell.

113
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:34,356
How long are you two gonna
go on like this?

114
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:35,825
You're acting like a little kid.

115
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,493
No, I'm not.

116
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,728
And infinity plus one year.

117
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:41,864
Andy?
Bring me the next person.

118
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:45,968
Perd Hapley.
Crazy Ira and the Douche.

119
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:47,536
Tom Haverford?

120
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:49,004
That's nice, but I don't know
if you can really consider me

121
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,172
a celebrity.

122
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,607
Yeah, that's your handwriting.

123
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,309
These are all great options,
but I think we need

124
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:56,545
to go after Pawnee's
biggest fish--

125
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,813
Annabel Porter from Bloosh.

126
00:04:57,848 --> 00:04:59,281
That horrifying
lifestyle newsletter

127
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:02,451
filled with vegan recipes
and pointless tchotchkes?

128
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,787
Forget it.
That woman is my nightmare.

129
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:07,690
Um, she's a big deal, Ron.

130
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,860
Bloosh just won the Pulitzer
Prize for Best Top Ten Listicle

131
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,695
two years in a row.

132
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,130
Hi, Leslie.

133
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:16,899
Bill Haggerty from the Pawnee
Historical Society.

134
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,101
Oh, yes, Bill.
I remember you.

135
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:20,936
I heard you were looking
for information

136
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:24,406
on the Newport land, and I have
some very exciting news for you.

137
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:27,810
It concerns William Henry
Harrison.

138
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:30,079
We claim William Henry
Harrison as a hero

139
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:31,280
because he was
the first governor

140
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:32,515
of the Indiana territories,

141
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:34,717
and then President
of the United States.

142
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,252
We're also a little ashamed
of him

143
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:38,921
because he didn't wear a coat
at his inauguration,

144
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:42,057
caught a bad cold
and died 32 days later.

145
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,759
He's an embarrassing footnote.

146
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:46,295
But he's our embarrassing
footnote.

147
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:49,231
I've recently self-Published
a biography about Harrison

148
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,201
entitled,<i> Barely A President.</i>

149
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:55,704
<i>William Henry Harrison's</i>
<i>32 Days In The White House."</i>

150
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,573
I discovered that Harrison had

151
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,076
a heretofore
unknown hunting lodge

152
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,778
on the very land you're trying
to acquire.

153
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:06,015
Um, spoilers much?
Now I'll never read that book.

154
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:08,484
If a U.S. President had
a house on that land,

155
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:10,619
it could qualify for historic
landmark status,

156
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:12,655
and we could really stick it
to Ron's team.

157
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:13,889
Which would be icing
on the cake,

158
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:15,491
not the reason
why we're doing this.

159
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:17,393
Okay.
Show me this incredible lodge.

160
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:18,627
Let's go.

161
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:20,696
That book sounded so boring,
I cried a little.

162
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:23,299
Oh, babe.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

163
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,633
You're safe now.

164
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:25,768
Hey, Ron.

165
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,203
Sorry to bother you,
but I need you to sign

166
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,371
this point of sale document.

167
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,807
And please sign it in cursive.

168
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:33,409
It raises a lot of red flags
if you--

169
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:36,045
- No.
- Okay.

170
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,447
So...
what's Leslie up to?

171
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,149
Well, I don't think I should
discuss that,

172
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:41,817
given that you're in
competition.

173
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:44,587
- Need to remain neutral.
- Fair enough.

174
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:46,288
Terry, what's Leslie up to?

175
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,691
She is trying to find
a historical to earmark

176
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:49,692
the land for preservation.

177
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:51,227
Terry, come on, man.

178
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:54,063
Leslie, you little sneak.

179
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:56,365
If Leslie's going for a hook,
we should too.

180
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,002
Let's get Annabel Bloosh Person.
Yes!

181
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:01,537
Glad to see you
finally come around

182
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:02,805
after these two minutes
of insanity.

183
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,007
Now will you please consider
investing

184
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,309
in that toddler cologne
I've been bugging you about.

185
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,477
Toddler cologne.

186
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,880
Baby--tsst tsst--
you smell good.

187
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:14,917
Here we are.

188
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:18,287
Here we are, like, "Here's
the place where I buried the map

189
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,289
that will show us the way
to William Henry Harrison's

190
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:21,690
awesome hunting cabin?"

191
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:25,161
- No, this is all that's left.
- This place is awesome.

192
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,496
Hey, we should sell our dumb
house and buy this one.

193
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,266
Okay, you know, I love William
Henry Harrison as much,

194
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,069
if not slightly more than the
next guy, but this is garbage.

195
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:36,739
I mean, literally, there's a bag
of old hamburgers over there.

196
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:39,575
What?
Ohh.

197
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,977
We're running out of time
and we need to beat Ron.

198
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:45,915
So...we're gonna have to use
this old pile of bricks.

199
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:48,984
I need to gather everything
I can on William Henry Harrison.

200
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:51,987
Let's head to the Harrison
Museum over in Vincennes.

201
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:53,656
I volunteer there part time.

202
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,692
I just found an artifact!
Historical artifact.

203
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,061
William Henry Harrison's wig.

204
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:03,090
- Andy, put that down.
- Cool.

205
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:06,282
You've got to be kidding me.

206
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:08,466
No, I'm sorry, but there's
a page missing from the document

207
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,881
so then the signatures
are invalid.

208
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:12,849
Can't we just say it was there?

209
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:15,085
You're asking a notary to lie.

210
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,653
I signed an oath, Ben.

211
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:19,956
And then a different notary
notarized the oath I signed.

212
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:23,527
William Henry Harrison
is totally ridiculous.

213
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:25,696
They can't even fill a small
museum with real stuff

214
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,597
about his life because
he was so lame.

215
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,168
The "If He'd Worn A Coat Room"
explores how great America

216
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:35,105
would have been if Harrison had
worn a coat at his inauguration.

217
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,673
And not died.

218
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,175
<i>This room is called

219
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,811
"Other Things That Were
Famous for One Month."

220
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:45,882
Oh, and side note, admission
to this museum costs $14.

221
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:48,718
And while you're here,
why not visit

222
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:51,755
the "Other Famous Harrisons"
exhibit.

223
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:54,725
Okay, guys, this is so great.

224
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,661
During the election campaign
of 1840, William Henry Harrison

225
00:08:57,695 --> 00:09:02,332
supporters rolled this ten foot
tin and paper ball

226
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:05,068
down country lanes all across
America.

227
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:07,104
And--And they would sing along
with a jug band,

228
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:08,605
and it was just so exciting.

229
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,173
People would come for miles
just to see it.

230
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,176
Why, was there something
inside this stupid ball?

231
00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:14,811
Ooh, like a giant hamster?

232
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,414
This is what we have
to work with, okay.

233
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:19,850
We are up against a very flashy
internet company,

234
00:09:19,884 --> 00:09:22,719
and we should be aiming
for quantity over quality.

235
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:25,522
So we're gonna throw a bunch
of Harrison facts at them

236
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:28,525
and a big pile of bricks
and whatever else we can find.

237
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,028
Quantity, people.
Quantity!

238
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:33,296
Wow.

239
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:36,199
This is exactly what I imagine
Heaven looks like.

240
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:39,136
Right down to the unisex
linen tunics.

241
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,904
- Annabel,<i> ma cherie.</i>
- Hi.

242
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:42,839
I'm sorry I'm late
for our coven.

243
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:46,043
I was polishing my oyster forks
with a cage-free olive oil rub.

244
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:47,677
Apology accepted, and then

245
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,647
I have no reaction
to anything else you said.

246
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:53,583
I can't help but ask,
what's in right now?

247
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:55,786
Well, this season I'm intrigued

248
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,156
by...asymmetrical overalls,

249
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,426
angora toothbrushes,
and locally sourced

250
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,760
Italian flip flops.

251
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:07,130
Also, there's a flirty trend
in beverages.

252
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:09,299
So you've had soy milk
and almond milk.

253
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:14,938
Now try the hottest
new craze...beef milk.

254
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:19,376
It's like almond milk that's
been squeezed through tiny holes

255
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,679
in living cows.

256
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:24,114
It's fucking milk.

257
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:26,616
- No.
- No.

258
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:28,118
Milk cost $3 a gallon.

259
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:29,473
Annabel's authentic,
hand-strained

260
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:31,121
teat-to-table beef milk,

261
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:33,490
that costs $60 a gallon.

262
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:36,026
Yeah, and there's a wait list.

263
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,428
This woman knows business.

264
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,731
And I'd be extremely jazzed
to be a part of the Gryzzl bid.

265
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,735
Shall we discuss it in my yurt?
Great.

266
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,739
Ron?
Okay, let's try this again.

267
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:53,510
All pages accounted for,
just sign right here.

268
00:10:53,544 --> 00:10:55,645
How is Leslie doing
with her quest?

269
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,315
Again, I don't want to talk
about her plan with you,

270
00:10:58,349 --> 00:10:59,850
nor yours with her.

271
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:02,018
- Sure you understand.
- Absolutely.

272
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,787
Terry, what is Leslie up to?

273
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:05,288
Oh, getting ready for a big
press conference.

274
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:06,990
Terry, come on.

275
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:08,258
A press conference.

276
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,395
So she's found something
to strengthen her bid.

277
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:15,132
Ms. Porter,
no need to discuss any further.

278
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,301
You will be the face
of the Gryzzl bid.

279
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:18,602
Smashing.

280
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,872
Well, this calls for a
celebratory dram of aged grappa.

281
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:23,240
- Okay, so I just sign here?
- No.

282
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:25,142
No, no!
Aw.

283
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:28,045
Great.
There you go.

284
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,814
- Yeah, that's invalid now.
- Yeah, I know.

285
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:32,783
Excuse me, Mr. Haggerty?

286
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,385
I just wanted to say that
I really like your museum.

287
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,390
It's weird and sad
and unnecessary.

288
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:45,962
Is there, like, a museum curator
position I could apply for?

289
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,066
Sorry, everyone here
is a volunteer.

290
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,101
Though you do get
a yearly stipend

291
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:54,171
of 50,000 Harrison Bucks.

292
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:58,075
Accepted only
at that vending machine.

293
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:00,944
- Thanks.
- That's a bummer.

294
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:02,312
But, hey, hey, listen.

295
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,415
Maybe you could start
your own museum.

296
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,750
About what?

297
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:09,519
I'm sorry,
but I am not like you.

298
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:10,687
You love everything.

299
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:14,625
The only things I like are dogs,
sleeping late,

300
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:16,426
and weird birthmarks.

301
00:12:16,461 --> 00:12:18,462
You can't make museums
about those.

302
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:20,263
- This is another dead end.
- Guys?

303
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:21,498
Let's keep it going, right?

304
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,899
Somebody grab
the reading glasses,

305
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:24,214
somebody grab
that walking stick.

306
00:12:24,235 --> 00:12:25,869
Grab everything you can.

307
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:29,072
I'm officially dubbing this
Operation Quantity.

308
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:30,540
Oh, thank God you're still here.

309
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:33,610
I cannot believe the weird
notary hell

310
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:34,878
I've been trapped in.

311
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:36,947
Been more like heaven for me.
I mean, what a day.

312
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:39,182
- What's Ron up to?
- Okay, I am not--

313
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,817
- No, no, you have to tell me
because you legally vow yourself

314
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:41,818
to me in marriage.

315
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:43,453
- Sucker.
- Okay, fine.

316
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:45,489
They got Annabel Porter
to be the celebrity face

317
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:46,490
of their group.

318
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:47,724
Little rat.

319
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,393
Okay.
Two can play this game.

320
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:52,562
Bill?
Operation Quantity needs a face.

321
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:54,197
Does William Henry Harrison
have any direct descendants

322
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,432
in the area?

323
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:59,736
One--a distant nephew named
Zack Harrison.

324
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:02,406
This is our guy.
American royalty.

325
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,876
His veins pulse with the blood
of our storied forefather.

326
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,211
Zack Harrison?
I went to camp with this guy.

327
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,313
Ha ha!

328
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:10,847
No one would ride
in the boat with him

329
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:12,482
'cause he had terrible B.O.,
and then he went with Janine,

330
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:14,418
our counselor, and he fell
asleep and got a boner.

331
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,453
Well, he's
American royalty, okay?

332
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:17,788
And we need him for the press
conference, and we need

333
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:19,823
all of this stuff.

334
00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:23,760
So help me God, I will make a
mountain out of this mole hill.

335
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:28,053
- Leslie, I do--
- Quantity, people.

336
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:33,480
Notary public's can trace
our origin all the way back

337
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:34,781
to ancient Rome.

338
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,583
- No way.
- Calvin Coolidge was a notary.

339
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:37,917
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

340
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:39,552
And so was Calvin Coolidge's dad

341
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:41,921
and so was Calvin Coolidge's
paternal grandfather.

342
00:13:41,956 --> 00:13:43,123
Uh-huh.

343
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:45,525
It's 2.5 pounds of pressure
is what you need

344
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,160
to get the perfect stamp.

345
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,879
They have this monthly--

346
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:50,766
Well, it's a notary
email newsletter

347
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,734
and, oh, my gosh--

348
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:53,135
- All right.
- Ben, it's fun.

349
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:54,637
It's just fun.

350
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:55,832
Babe?

351
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,743
I have been thinking a lot about
what you said.

352
00:13:57,864 --> 00:14:00,899
I made a list of everything
that I know you like.

353
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:02,868
Playing with our dog,
staring contests,

354
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:04,769
sex with me, et cetera.

355
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:07,405
And then, I lost the list.

356
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,040
So I had to make a new list.

357
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:10,876
I didn't have any paper,
so I wrote it on my leg.

358
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,345
And that's when my leg fell
asleep--

359
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:15,347
- Okay, could you just skip
ahead a little?

360
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:17,782
What do all the things on
that list have in common?

361
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,885
They're one-on-one.

362
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,589
You like dealing with people,
or dogs, one-on-one.

363
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:27,392
See, we don't make a list
of the things that you love,

364
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:30,028
we make a list of the reasons
why you love them.

365
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:33,031
And then we find something
that fits that list.

366
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:35,233
You're the best husband ever.

367
00:14:39,138 --> 00:14:40,338
Hi, Zack Harrison.

368
00:14:40,373 --> 00:14:42,040
You wanted to meet with me about
a press conference?

369
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:43,275
Oh, yes.
Hello, Zack.

370
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:45,544
Yes, I am Leslie.
It is an honor to have you here.

371
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:48,980
You are Indiana's last living
link to this great man.

372
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:50,181
Look, I really don't think

373
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:52,083
you should make a big deal
out of this.

374
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:54,252
I just happen to be
a descendant of a guy.

375
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:56,021
You could be the descendant
of George Washington.

376
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:57,556
- I wouldn't know.
- Do you--

377
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,757
- No, that was just
a hypothetical.

378
00:14:58,791 --> 00:14:59,891
Could that be possible?

379
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:00,992
Because, you know,
I have always thought

380
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:03,728
that we shared very similar
jaw lines.

381
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:05,397
Wow.
That is something to chew on.

382
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:06,932
Anyway, okay.
It doesn't matter.

383
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,633
I need this to be
very impressive.

384
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:12,804
So head on in there and be
presidential...ly descendant.

385
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,072
Just go in there.
Okay?

386
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:15,173
- Just walk, walk, walk.
- I don't--

387
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,708
- Quiet down.
Walk in.

388
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,710
Zack.
Camp Wamapo, you got a boner.

389
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:20,679
We'll catch up.
What a dick.

390
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:23,315
Hey!
No.

391
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:25,517
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What--Ron?

392
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,618
What are you doing here?

393
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:28,052
Setting up for our
press conference,

394
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:30,121
which will take place
immediately after yours.

395
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:31,723
Are you crazy?
You can't do that.

396
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:33,325
- Do you want me to bite him?
- No.

397
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:35,093
Ignore them.

398
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:37,562
We start in ten minutes.

399
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:40,532
Swanson, you didn't say
anything about ambushing

400
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,167
Leslie's press conference.

401
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:43,501
I didn't think it was relevant.

402
00:15:43,536 --> 00:15:45,403
Come on, man.
This isn't cool.

403
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:48,140
This is a competition.
We need to win it.

404
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:50,842
Please do your jobs.

405
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:52,210
Good evening.

406
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:55,113
Pawnee is a place of culture,
history, and heritage,

407
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:57,282
and the National Park Service
is proud to say

408
00:15:57,316 --> 00:15:59,584
that we've discovered a new
chapter in the life

409
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:02,687
of local hero and president,
William Henry Harrison.

410
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:04,489
<i>A heretofore unknown

411
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:07,659
hunting lodge was recently
discovered

412
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:10,962
smack dab in the middle
of the Newport land.

413
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:13,698
What great historical moments

414
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:16,067
took place within
these hallowed halls?

415
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:19,237
Did Harrison plan his
presidential campaign

416
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:20,939
while sitting around the hearth?

417
00:16:20,973 --> 00:16:22,707
Which used to be there.

418
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:24,543
Did he write letters
to Thomas Jefferson

419
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:25,911
on his roll top desk?

420
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:27,979
Which, you know, I don't know,
might have existed.

421
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:30,615
The point is,
William Henry Harrison

422
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,820
would have wanted this land
preserved as a national park.

423
00:16:34,854 --> 00:16:37,189
Don't believe me?
Let's ask him.

424
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:41,993
In the form of his direct
descendant, Zachary.

425
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:47,799
Hi, I'm Zack.
Harrison.

426
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,100
Amazing.

427
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:51,036
Zachary, what is it like being
a descendant

428
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,938
of William Henry Harrison?

429
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:55,307
Uh, Harrison's
a pretty common last name.

430
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:57,375
Okay, sit.
Now.

431
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,345
Travel back in time with me
to 1840

432
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:02,948
when William Henry Harrison,
Old Tippecanoe,

433
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:04,449
runs for president.

434
00:17:04,484 --> 00:17:09,454
And his campaign rolls this
giant tin and paper ball

435
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:13,625
from town to town, while
Americans everywhere sing along.

436
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,659

Said some boring idiot
from 200 years ago.

449
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,759
Who cares about some dumb
grandpa and a tin ball?

450
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:49,961
That's the past.
Gryzzl is the future.

451
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:52,998
The Newport land will become
the Midwest headquarters

452
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:55,634
of America's most dynamic
technology company.

453
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:59,304
Here to introduce our vision
is Annabel Riordan from Bloosh

454
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:01,239
and the sexy ladies
known in Pawnee as

455
00:18:01,274 --> 00:18:04,943
The Somebody's Daughter Dancers.

456
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:07,979
Fresh.

457
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:10,982
Innovative.
Place-Making.

458
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:14,753
Disposable duvets.
Growth-Hacking.

459
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:17,522
Super-Moon
Gryzzl.

460
00:18:17,557 --> 00:18:23,028
Now come with me as we binge
watch the future.

461
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:29,768
That was sickening.
All flash and no substance.

462
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:32,738
It was exactly as substantive
as your presentation.

463
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:34,172
No, it was not.

464
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:36,041
We had way more quantity
than you.

465
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:37,909
Please.
Please.

466
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:40,912
For the love of all
that is holy, both of you,

467
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:44,516
please sign this form.

468
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,684
Not that it matters.

469
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:47,219
I'm definitely gonna wake up
tomorrow morning

470
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:50,055
with these same forms for you
to sign because I've died

471
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:53,258
somehow and now I'm a ghost
living in Purgatory

472
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:55,393
until I complete
my unfinished business.

473
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:57,162
Okay, I'm not signing anything
he's signing.

474
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:59,431
Did you just hear what I said?

475
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:01,900
No, of course, you didn't,
because I'm a ghost.

476
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,135
You know what?
I can't stand you.

477
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,073
I can't stand your stupid
mustache and your stupid shirt,

478
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:10,308
and your stupid name, Ron.

479
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:12,310
Ron.
It's not even a word.

480
00:19:12,345 --> 00:19:13,478
Well, I have had
just about enough

481
00:19:13,513 --> 00:19:15,680
of your stubborn behavior.

482
00:19:15,715 --> 00:19:17,282
Ever since
the Morningstar incident,

483
00:19:17,316 --> 00:19:19,384
you have been completely
unreasonable.

484
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:20,852
You are the unreasonable one!

485
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:23,255
You've been unreasonable
way before Morningstar.

486
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:25,657
You're the most unreasonable,
stubborn person I have ever met.

487
00:19:25,691 --> 00:19:27,359
And I am never gonna change
my mind on that,

488
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:30,829
no matter what anybody says!

489
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:33,165
You're not that good
at scrapbooking.

490
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:35,109
What?

491
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:39,504
Okay, would you just sign
right here?

492
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,806
And I will need your
thumbprints.

493
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:47,363
Man, those two really
hate each other.

494
00:19:47,397 --> 00:19:49,498
That feud's like
Biggie-Tupac level.

495
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,867
Maybe even Morgan Freeman-
Shailene Woodley level.

496
00:19:51,902 --> 00:19:53,869
Nah, it's bad,
but it's not that bad.

497
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:56,939
This is like when the triplets
fight, except I can't just give

498
00:19:56,973 --> 00:20:00,576
Leslie and Ron stuffed animals
to make them calm down.

499
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,045
Actually, that might work.
Have we tried that?

500
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,413
They've always butted heads.

501
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:06,248
I really--I don't think
they hate each other.

502
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:09,285
I just think they're very
different people and they just

503
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,639
drifted apart once they stopped
working in the same office.

504
00:20:13,823 --> 00:20:16,525
You okay?

505
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,395
Yeah, well I ordered 60
veggie pizzas to Ron's office,

506
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:20,796
so that calmed me down a little.

507
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:24,333
I know you're furious at him.

508
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:28,270
But please, come to a neutral
site and sit with Ron

509
00:20:28,305 --> 00:20:31,340
for 30 seconds so I can get
this dumb document signed.

510
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:32,742
Ugh.

511
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:34,176
I'll let you rename the triplets

512
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:36,912
Ruth, Bader, and Ginsburg.

513
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:40,182
Okay, fine.
But I get to sign first.

514
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:41,350
Oh, my God.

515
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:43,152
All right, let's just
get this over with.

516
00:20:43,186 --> 00:20:44,620
Oh, let me get that for you.

517
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,528
- Got 'em.
- What?

518
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:54,330
What's going on?
What's going on?

519
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:56,699
- Let us out immediately.
- No.

520
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,234
You guys are being ridiculous.

521
00:20:58,268 --> 00:21:01,137
This has gone too far, and
you are not leaving this office

522
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:04,573
until you've made peace.

523
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:06,542
Nooo!

524
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:11,247
No, no, no.

525
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:13,549
Sorry, Ron, doors are locked.

526
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,618
We've taken your key cards
and your phones,

527
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:17,453
and the automatic timer
won't go off

528
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:19,021
until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

529
00:21:19,055 --> 00:21:20,055
You're trapped in there.

530
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,457
We told security
not to disturb you

531
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,559
under any circumstances.

532
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:24,660
And the phones and internet?

533
00:21:24,694 --> 00:21:25,894
Oh, they've been disconnected.

534
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:28,397
And I left a rusty hacksaw
on the table,

535
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:31,033
so the first person who hacks
their face off gets release.

536
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:32,535
That's not--what?

537
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:33,802
Is that true?

538
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:36,138
Guys, this is insane, okay?
Let us out.

539
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:38,174
Oh, my God, babe.
<i>Game of Thrones</i> is on tonight.

540
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,575
It's the series finale.

541
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:41,977
Khaleesi is marrying
Jack Sparrow.

542
00:21:42,012 --> 00:21:44,313
Oh, God, that show has really
gone off the rails.

543
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:45,915
It makes sense
if you've read the books.

544
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:48,150
Look, our baby monitor
is on the table.

545
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:50,052
If you guys can talk this out

546
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:52,488
and settle your differences
like grown-ups,

547
00:21:52,522 --> 00:21:55,357
turn it on, and I will come
to get you from my office.

548
00:21:55,392 --> 00:21:58,527
Otherwise, we will see you
at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

549
00:21:58,562 --> 00:22:00,329
I am going to break out of here,

550
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:02,665
then I am going to snap you
in half.

551
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:03,666
Hey.

552
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,367
This is not his fault, Swanson.

553
00:22:05,402 --> 00:22:07,903
Be a man,
and get your house in order.

554
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:09,738
You too, Knope.

555
00:22:09,773 --> 00:22:10,973
Good luck, you guys.

556
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:12,842
I really hope you can work out
your differences.

557
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:14,944
Terry, look at me.

558
00:22:14,978 --> 00:22:17,012
Is this what you want to do?

559
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:20,349
Think very carefully, son.

560
00:22:20,383 --> 00:22:21,650
There you go.

561
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:23,052
That's right, buddy.

562
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:24,453
Come on.

563
00:22:24,488 --> 00:22:27,323
For once in your life,
do something right.

564
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:28,824
Stop it, Terry.

565
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:30,392
Both of you.
Come on.

566
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:31,961
Damn it, Terry!

567
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:53,983
Okay, think.

568
00:22:54,017 --> 00:22:55,518
There must be a way out of here.

569
00:22:55,552 --> 00:22:56,952
I don't think there is.

570
00:22:56,987 --> 00:22:59,155
They installed these magnetic
locks two years ago.

571
00:22:59,189 --> 00:23:00,656
There's no way around them.

572
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,057
Yes, there is.

573
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:04,126
I'll simply punch my fist
through a window.

574
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:06,195
Ron, there's security wire
in there.

575
00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:07,630
You'll slice your arm open.

576
00:23:07,664 --> 00:23:09,465
I would rather bleed out
than sit here

577
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:12,134
and talk about my feelings
for ten hours.

578
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:13,102
There is another way.

579
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:14,670
We'll just wait a few minutes,

580
00:23:14,704 --> 00:23:17,473
turn on this monitor,
and then we'll tell Ben

581
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:19,408
that we talked it out
and made up.

582
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:22,411
I'll just tell them that
I apologized for...

583
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:25,081
whatever,
heroically caring too much,

584
00:23:25,115 --> 00:23:27,049
and you admitted that
you're a stubborn butthead,

585
00:23:27,084 --> 00:23:28,217
and everything's fine now.

586
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:30,386
Why do I have to be stubborn?

587
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,888
Why can't the problem have been
that I was reasonable

588
00:23:32,923 --> 00:23:33,956
and you were at fault?

589
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,025
Because we want them
to believe us

590
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:37,493
and not laugh really hard

591
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:39,995
at a ridiculous
science fiction scenario.

592
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,864
We are not saying
I was the problem.

593
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:44,633
If we're gonna lie to them,
I will<i> not</i> let you lie to them.

594
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:45,868
Fine!

595
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,069
I'll tell them
that for the past three years,

596
00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:48,871
you've been a perfect gentleman
and scholar,

597
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:50,406
and I am an insane weirdo

598
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,941
who, despite being
the only reason

599
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:54,009
we even had a friendship
to begin with,

600
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:57,680
decided to ruin it out of
the blue for no good reason.

601
00:23:57,714 --> 00:23:59,248
That sounds good.
Let's go with that.

602
00:24:01,118 --> 00:24:02,251
What are you doing?

603
00:24:02,285 --> 00:24:03,452
I destroyed the monitor!

604
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:04,887
What if we have an emergency

605
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:06,255
and have to get out of here?

606
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:09,091
I did not consider
that possibility!

607
00:24:12,662 --> 00:24:15,464
Everything's different.

608
00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:18,601
I mean, the furniture,
the pictures.

609
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:20,569
Craig changed everything.

610
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:21,537
Did he?

611
00:24:21,571 --> 00:24:22,771
I tried not to notice anything

612
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:24,306
when I worked here.

613
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:25,608
Or talk to anyone.

614
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:27,376
Or learn anyone's name.

615
00:24:27,411 --> 00:24:29,879
You, of all people,
should know that, Lauren.

616
00:24:29,913 --> 00:24:32,748
Look, we are gonna be here
for ten hours.

617
00:24:32,783 --> 00:24:34,250
We could either
talk about our issues

618
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:35,484
and work through our problems,

619
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,119
or we can just sit here
doing nothing.

620
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:38,354
I choose "sit here."

621
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:39,755
Come on, Ron,
why don't we just--

622
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,323
- Sit here.
- Ron.

623
00:24:41,358 --> 00:24:44,160
Sit here.

624
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:46,095
I bet I can make you talk.

625
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:47,596
I'll take that bet

626
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:49,632
at any odds,
for any amount of money,

627
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,000
over any length of time

628
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:54,570
stretching from now
into infinity.

629
00:24:54,604 --> 00:24:55,871
Talk to me. Talk to me.
Talk to me. Talk to me.

630
00:24:55,906 --> 00:24:57,039
Talk to me. Talk to me.
Talk to me. Talk to me.

631
00:24:57,073 --> 00:24:58,174
Talk to me. Talk. Talk. Talk.

632
00:24:59,943 --> 00:25:01,043
Talk to me!

633
00:25:01,077 --> 00:25:05,347
Drip. Drip.
One word, and this is over.

634
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:07,583
I think wood is stupid,
and so does everybody else.

635
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:10,586
You guys, Ron loves plastic.

636
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,521
Last chance, Ron.

637
00:25:12,556 --> 00:25:14,824
You want to talk? Huh?

638
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:17,860
Aha!

639
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:19,628
Jackpot.

640
00:25:19,663 --> 00:25:20,930
You know what this is, Ron?

641
00:25:20,964 --> 00:25:24,800
This is a mix I made for
the summer Parks barbecue, 2007.

642
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:26,396
I asked everyone
in the Parks Department

643
00:25:26,403 --> 00:25:27,770
to choose one song.

644
00:25:27,804 --> 00:25:31,073
You chose<i> Buddy</i>
by Willie Nelson,

645
00:25:31,108 --> 00:25:33,809
a fact I remember
because my mind

646
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:35,945
is a steel trap
of friendship nuggets.

647
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:38,581
But I am not going to play
your choice.

648
00:25:38,615 --> 00:25:40,416
I'm gonna play Jerry's choice.

649
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:43,719
Ooh, that's right.

650
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:45,187
And I'm gonna sing along.

651
00:25:45,222 --> 00:25:48,290
And I'm gonna maintain
eye contact the whole time.

652
00:25:48,325 --> 00:25:51,093

or do you want to talk?

Great.

674
00:26:26,396 --> 00:26:27,963
So...

675
00:26:27,998 --> 00:26:29,498
what would you like
to talk about?

676
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:30,499
Oh, come on, Ron.

677
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:31,667
We were friends for ten years.

678
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:33,669
We were work proximity
associates.

679
00:26:33,703 --> 00:26:34,870
We were friends.

680
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:36,138
And now we're not.

681
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:39,708
And once again, it is up to me
to save our friendship,

682
00:26:39,743 --> 00:26:42,344
and I will do so using
the most powerful tool

683
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:44,080
known to man:

684
00:26:44,114 --> 00:26:47,883
a well-organized chart.

685
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:51,220
Three years ago, I accept
a job at National Parks.

686
00:26:51,254 --> 00:26:53,289
You and I see each other less,
admittedly,

687
00:26:53,323 --> 00:26:54,390
due to my busy schedule

688
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:56,058
and your utter lack of interest

689
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:57,560
in maintaining
adult friendships.

690
00:26:57,594 --> 00:27:00,062
Work proximity
associate-ships.

691
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:01,938
Three months later,
April comes to work for me.

692
00:27:01,965 --> 00:27:02,932
We throw her a party.

693
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:04,500
At her request,
the party's theme

694
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:07,136
is "Zombie Teenage Biker Gang
Pizza Jamboree."

695
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,104
I remember.

696
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:09,739
You made me wear
a leather jacket.

697
00:27:09,773 --> 00:27:11,507
That is the last time
you and I see each other

698
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:13,409
for more than five minutes.

699
00:27:13,443 --> 00:27:15,778
Three months later,
you come and visit me

700
00:27:15,812 --> 00:27:19,148
at my office on the third floor
for the very first time.

701
00:27:19,182 --> 00:27:22,084
One week later,
I return from a trip,

702
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:25,554
and I find out you have quit
the Parks Department

703
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:28,057
and you have started
your own building company

704
00:27:28,091 --> 00:27:30,860
without even bothering
to tell me.

705
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:32,495
"Oh, well," I think to myself.

706
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:34,029
"You know, it was only
a matter of time."

707
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:36,665
And then, two months after that,

708
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,601
Morningstar--

709
00:27:38,635 --> 00:27:39,802
the final twist of the knife.

710
00:27:39,836 --> 00:27:41,137
Oh, for God's sake.

711
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:42,304
I hear about Morningstar,

712
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:45,141
and I calmly saunter
down to your office

713
00:27:45,175 --> 00:27:47,535
and attempt to have a rational
discussion with you about it.

714
00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:49,745
What the hell, Ron?

715
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,614
You're building
your stupid building

716
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:53,649
on the block
next to Pawnee Commons?

717
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:56,452
The park that I built
from scratch out of a pit?

718
00:27:56,486 --> 00:27:58,421
This building is gonna ruin
the views, you jerk.

719
00:27:58,455 --> 00:28:00,756
And you're gonna tear
all the houses down?

720
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,692
- Yes.
- Ann lived there, Ron.

721
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:04,994
That's Ann's old house.

722
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:06,929
That's my best friend's
old house.

723
00:28:06,963 --> 00:28:09,198
That was the house
where I put on my wedding dress

724
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:10,232
the night I got married.

725
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:12,001
That is the house where
April and Andy

726
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:13,235
met for the first time.

727
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,137
That is the house
where Ann gave me

728
00:28:15,172 --> 00:28:17,306
my first ever smoky eye look.

729
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,542
She hasn't lived there
for five years.

730
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:20,710
That's not the point.

731
00:28:20,744 --> 00:28:23,279
This building is a monstrosity.

732
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:25,948
And what's it called?
Morningstar?

733
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:27,216
"Oh, dear.

734
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,418
"We live at the Morningstar.

735
00:28:29,453 --> 00:28:32,154
That's so posh and
hibbley-fibbley-gibbley."

736
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:34,590
The world needs
apartment buildings.

737
00:28:34,624 --> 00:28:36,092
The park you built is nice,

738
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:37,426
and people want to live
next to it.

739
00:28:37,461 --> 00:28:38,794
That's not the point.

740
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:40,763
You knew that
I would be furious,

741
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:43,499
and you didn't have the guts
to tell me yourself.

742
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:45,868
Enjoy your new job, Judas.

743
00:28:47,003 --> 00:28:49,705
You tear down Ann's house.

744
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,174
You spend the next two years
cutting down trees

745
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:55,711
and fighting zoning laws
that I helped pass,

746
00:28:55,746 --> 00:28:59,648
basically spitting on everything
we did together at Parks.

747
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:03,219
That's not the whole story.

748
00:29:03,253 --> 00:29:04,387
What does that mean?

749
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:05,655
It means what it means.

750
00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:06,889
That...

751
00:29:06,923 --> 00:29:10,192
is not the whole story
of why I left.

752
00:29:12,562 --> 00:29:14,730
Sorry, time is up.

753
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:15,731
Wait.

754
00:29:15,765 --> 00:29:17,666
Why then?
What was the reason?

755
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:18,768
Ron, come on.

756
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:20,202
Oh, my God, you made a key?

757
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:21,437
Ron, please, don't--

758
00:29:21,471 --> 00:29:22,705
Come on, Ron.

759
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:24,406
Ron, just talk to me.

760
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:25,408
Ron, come on.

761
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:29,111
See you tomorrow morning.

762
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:30,579
Okay.

763
00:29:30,614 --> 00:29:31,614
Progress.

764
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:34,950
Is it that I sent you
a birthday card

765
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:36,251
through the US mail,

766
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:38,253
so the post office
knew your address?

767
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:39,454
No. Go away.

768
00:29:39,888 --> 00:29:42,156
Ooh, is it because
I had Food and Stuff

769
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,704
temporarily shut down
due to a health code violation?

770
00:29:45,091 --> 00:29:46,260
That was you?

771
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:50,597
They had fresh produce out
right next to the roach spray.

772
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:54,068
The name of the store
is "Food and Stuff."

773
00:29:54,102 --> 00:29:56,103
They sell food,
and they sell stuff.

774
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:58,372
If you don't like it,
go to that new place,

775
00:29:58,406 --> 00:29:59,773
Complete Food.

776
00:29:59,808 --> 00:30:02,009
It's called Whole Foods.

777
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:04,111
- And is that really the reason?
- No.

778
00:30:04,145 --> 00:30:07,514
How many more questions
are you going to ask me?

779
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:10,317
As many as I need to
to solve this mystery

780
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:14,788
and get us engaged in a deep
and stimulating conversation

781
00:30:14,823 --> 00:30:16,390
about our friendship.

782
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:17,391
Ron, what are you doing?

783
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:18,559
I know I saw it.

784
00:30:18,593 --> 00:30:19,626
Aha!

785
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:22,162
Detonator.

786
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,431
The partially defused
claymore mine

787
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:26,300
you gave me ten years ago.

788
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:28,902
I'm gonna use it to blow
a hole in this damn door

789
00:30:28,937 --> 00:30:30,504
so I can get out of here.

790
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,674
- Ron, just wait a second.
- No.

791
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,242
I'm being held as a prisoner
against my will,

792
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:37,945
and I have the right, as
a citizen of the United States,

793
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:40,547
to blow a hole
in that fucking door

794
00:30:40,582 --> 00:30:42,282
and walk out as a free man.

795
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:43,751
It's in the Constitution.

796
00:30:43,785 --> 00:30:45,519
There's no cursing
in the Constitution.

797
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:47,521
Look, before you do that--

798
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:49,123
- Too late.
Here we go.

799
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:52,092
Fire in the hole!

800
00:30:55,163 --> 00:30:56,730
Whoo!

801
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,402
I gave you that as a gift

802
00:31:01,436 --> 00:31:03,604
on your fifth anniversary
as Parks director.

803
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:05,839
You told me

804
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:09,543
this was a genuine partially
defused claymore mine.

805
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,978
Well, it was.

806
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:13,614
I bought the empty shell
off of eBay,

807
00:31:13,648 --> 00:31:15,182
and then I filled it
with, you know,

808
00:31:15,216 --> 00:31:17,084
balloons and confetti and such.

809
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:19,787
You mean to tell me
I have had a toy

810
00:31:19,821 --> 00:31:22,189
on my desk for ten years?

811
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:23,624
You mean to tell me
you've thought

812
00:31:23,658 --> 00:31:26,593
you've thought you had an actual
land mine on your desk?

813
00:31:26,628 --> 00:31:28,395
Congratulations, Ron.

814
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,864
You've been doing
an explosive job!

815
00:31:33,802 --> 00:31:34,768
Come on, Ron.

816
00:31:34,803 --> 00:31:35,736
It's funny stuff.

817
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,205
Who gets angry at balloons?

818
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,573
Good talk.

819
00:31:44,312 --> 00:31:45,713
What's all this?

820
00:31:45,747 --> 00:31:48,182
I'm just reading back through
some of our old projects,

821
00:31:48,216 --> 00:31:51,685
trying to figure out what
happened that made you quit.

822
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,886
Good God, woman.

823
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:54,788
This is a code.

824
00:31:54,823 --> 00:31:56,790
I am going to break it.

825
00:31:56,825 --> 00:32:00,027
And this is my best shot.

826
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:01,628
Is that nuclear waste?

827
00:32:01,663 --> 00:32:04,331
No, this is my job application
from when you hired me.

828
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:05,499
How did you get that?

829
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:07,968
Freedom of Information Act
request.

830
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:09,536
But here's the thing.
I've never read it.

831
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:11,505
This application contains

832
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:14,174
your very first impressions
of me.

833
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:16,276
It's the Rosetta Stone, Ron.

834
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:18,946
The beginning of
the whole shebang.

835
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:22,449
This is all you wrote?

836
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:23,650
Three lousy lines?

837
00:32:23,685 --> 00:32:25,986
Why would anyone need
more than three lines?

838
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:28,856
I'm describing a person,
not something complicated

839
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,959
like a wooden sailing ship
or proper dovetail technique.

840
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,360
I forgot what I wrote.

841
00:32:33,395 --> 00:32:34,695
Can I hear it?

842
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:36,363
Why don't you read it yourself?

843
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:38,866
"Leslie Knope
is an absurd idealist

844
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,933
"whose political leanings

845
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:42,569
are slightly to the left
of Leon Trotsky."

846
00:32:42,604 --> 00:32:44,605
So far, so accurate.

847
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:45,873
"If we were to work together,

848
00:32:45,907 --> 00:32:47,675
"she would undoubtedly
drive me insane,

849
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:50,744
and it is possible that
we would murder each other."

850
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:55,175
You forgot the last sentence.

851
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:56,150
No, I didn't.

852
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:58,619
I remember that part.

853
00:32:58,653 --> 00:33:01,355
It says, "Hire her."

854
00:33:02,424 --> 00:33:03,490
Did you hear that?

855
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,125
Oh, it's--
it's a person.

856
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,660
It's another person!

857
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:08,028
Hello! Hello!

858
00:33:08,062 --> 00:33:10,130
- Janitor!
- Hey!

859
00:33:10,165 --> 00:33:11,832
- Hey, we're trapped in here!
- Hey!

860
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:15,936
♪ The best thing
about being a woman ♪

861
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:17,271
♪ Is the prerogative ♪

862
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:18,405
Please, Mr. Janitor.

863
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,407
If you just look over here
for two seconds,

864
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:21,375
I'll do anything.

865
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:22,443
Hey!

866
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:23,477
I'll watch a foreign film.

867
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:25,579
I'll talk to a man
with a ponytail.

868
00:33:25,613 --> 00:33:29,216
Oh, he's gone, Ron.
He's gone.

869
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:33,354
Why did you give me the job?

870
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:34,421
And that's what I don't get.

871
00:33:34,456 --> 00:33:35,856
We should've never
worked together.

872
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,124
Why did you hire me?

873
00:33:37,158 --> 00:33:38,759
Because of your interview.

874
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:40,561
Okay, that doesn't make
any sense.

875
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:42,696
I mean,
I remember that interview.

876
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:45,566
You were wearing
that exact outfit.

877
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,535
And you said to me, "Ms. Knope,
I have one question for you.

878
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,038
What do you believe the role
of government is in America?"

879
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,840
You blathered on for ten minutes

880
00:33:52,874 --> 00:33:56,243
about social safety nets
and honest governance

881
00:33:56,278 --> 00:33:57,745
and improving lives.

882
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:59,113
Basic nonsense.

883
00:33:59,147 --> 00:34:01,467
Then you said, "Everything
that just came out of your mouth

884
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:02,816
"is basic nonsense.

885
00:34:02,851 --> 00:34:03,784
Good day."

886
00:34:03,818 --> 00:34:04,918
And that was it.

887
00:34:04,953 --> 00:34:06,787
No, that was not it.

888
00:34:06,821 --> 00:34:08,222
After I said
you were full of it,

889
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,724
you got very angry
and scrunched up your face

890
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:13,594
and said, "Excuse me, sir,
but I disagree."

891
00:34:14,963 --> 00:34:17,031
Did you let me have it.

892
00:34:17,065 --> 00:34:19,333
That was one of
your top ten tirades, I'd say.

893
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:21,502
You were pounding your fist
and shaking.

894
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:23,404
You called me a heartless thug.

895
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,039
I most certainly did not.

896
00:34:25,073 --> 00:34:27,574
You were tough and honest,

897
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:29,476
and you stood up
for what you believed in,

898
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:32,112
even though it might've killed
your chance to get the job.

899
00:34:32,147 --> 00:34:34,481
I would rather work
with a person like that

900
00:34:34,516 --> 00:34:38,352
than with
a milquetoast yes-man.

901
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:40,387
Should be one more thing
in that file.

902
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:42,089
Aw, it's the thank-you note
I wrote to you

903
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,290
after the interview.

904
00:34:43,324 --> 00:34:44,325
You kept it.

905
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:46,160
"Dear Mr. Swanson,
I'm sorry

906
00:34:46,194 --> 00:34:48,328
"for raising my voice
in the interview,

907
00:34:48,363 --> 00:34:50,123
and I'm sorry
I called you a heartless thug."

908
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,799
Oh, well, okay.
There you go.

909
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,467
"If it matters,
I promise I would never

910
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:55,836
raise my voice at you
if we worked together."

911
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,937
Liar.

912
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:59,173
Yeah, I was being
really optimistic.

913
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:00,908
"Please enjoy
these homemade brownies

914
00:35:00,942 --> 00:35:02,076
"as a gesture of goodwill.

915
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,944
Leslie Knope."

916
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:06,513
That was the real reason
I hired you.

917
00:35:06,548 --> 00:35:08,916
Those brownies were damn good.

918
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,251
Ron, look how far we've come.

919
00:35:11,286 --> 00:35:12,953
We're doing so great.

920
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:14,388
Let's just bring it home, okay?

921
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:15,756
Let's just talk about
our issues.

922
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,291
- Leslie, don't push it.
- Okay, fine.

923
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:20,194
If I guess and guess right,
you have to tell me.

924
00:35:20,228 --> 00:35:22,096
Ready?

925
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,432
Two years ago, you found out
you were 1/4 French,

926
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:26,834
and you had a nervous breakdown.

927
00:35:26,868 --> 00:35:29,837
Okay, playtime is over.

928
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:31,972
I'm getting out of here
once and for all.

929
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:33,073
No, Ron! God, no!

930
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:38,045
That alarm is just
for sprinklers.

931
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,146
April kept pulling it,

932
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,348
so the fire department
disconnected it.

933
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:42,583
I see.

934
00:35:49,094 --> 00:35:51,695
Ron? I found some towels.

935
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,531
You okay?

936
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:56,365
Wow.

937
00:35:56,485 --> 00:35:58,884
Apparently,
Craig is studying yoga.

938
00:35:59,238 --> 00:36:01,239
These are the only
dry clothes I could find.

939
00:36:01,274 --> 00:36:02,975
Well, you look great.

940
00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:04,176
I feel extremely angry.

941
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,644
Oh, come on.

942
00:36:05,678 --> 00:36:07,145
Stop whining, you big baby.

943
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,214
I've seen you
with your eyebrows blown off.

944
00:36:09,248 --> 00:36:10,882
I've seen you
without a mustache.

945
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:11,950
I've seen it all.

946
00:36:11,985 --> 00:36:13,251
There's nowhere to run, Ron.

947
00:36:13,286 --> 00:36:15,854
You have tried every possible
means of escape.

948
00:36:15,888 --> 00:36:18,290
There's nothing to do but talk.

949
00:36:18,324 --> 00:36:19,458
What happened

950
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:23,128
to these "workplace proximity
associates"?

951
00:36:23,162 --> 00:36:24,296
Hmm?

952
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,932
Spill it.

953
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:29,501
You left.

954
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:32,170
Then a month later,
you took Terry with you.

955
00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:33,972
Yeah, well, we needed
a mindless factotum,

956
00:36:34,006 --> 00:36:35,674
and he's the best there is.

957
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:38,110
Amen.

958
00:36:38,144 --> 00:36:40,546
Then you took April.

959
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,181
I didn't want her to go,
as she had become

960
00:36:43,216 --> 00:36:46,551
one of my closest
workplace acquaintances.

961
00:36:46,586 --> 00:36:48,387
But your offer was too good
to pass up,

962
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:50,322
so I didn't try to stop her.

963
00:36:50,356 --> 00:36:52,824
Then Tom left
to run his business.

964
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:54,693
Donna left to run hers.

965
00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:56,695
One day, I looked up.

966
00:36:56,729 --> 00:36:58,997
Just didn't recognize anyone.

967
00:36:59,032 --> 00:37:01,900
So I made a decision.

968
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:04,136
An unthinkable decision.

969
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:06,738
Hey.

970
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:08,206
Well, my, my, my.

971
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:09,241
Do my eyes deceive me?

972
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:10,909
Is that Ron Swanson?

973
00:37:10,943 --> 00:37:12,711
Hello, Leslie.

974
00:37:12,745 --> 00:37:13,946
Hello, April. Larry.

975
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,947
It's Terry now.

976
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:16,214
Okay.

977
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:17,749
- As luck would have it--
- One second. Oh.

978
00:37:17,784 --> 00:37:19,317
Did you talk to Randy
about the vote?

979
00:37:19,352 --> 00:37:21,453
Tell the Northeast that
we need to put pressure on them,

980
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:22,788
or else we're gonna be waiting
forever,

981
00:37:22,822 --> 00:37:24,089
and I'm tired of waiting
on them, okay?

982
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:25,490
Sorry.
This is a crazy day.

983
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:26,886
So what's up with you,
you big lug?

984
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:28,026
Nothing important.

985
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:30,362
Just thought you might want
to have lunch.

986
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:31,797
- Tomorrow?
- I would love to.

987
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:34,766
It's been too long.
JJ's Diner, 12:30?

988
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,735
- Excellent. See you then.
- Okay.

989
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:39,204
So Randy says
the House is voting tomorrow,

990
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:41,039
and they need us in Washington
to prep.

991
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:42,174
Oh, my God, really?

992
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:43,742
Okay, get us the first flight
out of here

993
00:37:43,776 --> 00:37:44,810
and grab the Missouri files.

994
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:46,745
Meet me at my car.

995
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:49,214
Hey, babe.
I got to go to Washington.

996
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:51,083
Can you pick up the kids?

997
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:52,884
Oh. Oh, no.

998
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:55,120
Ron, I stood you up for lunch.

999
00:37:55,154 --> 00:37:56,788
You did, yes.

1000
00:37:56,823 --> 00:37:58,757
I waited for a while,
but it was pretty easy

1001
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,225
to figure out what had happened.

1002
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,594
Your life seemed pretty hectic.

1003
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:04,596
Is that the rest of the story?

1004
00:38:04,631 --> 00:38:06,898
That I stood you up?

1005
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:10,736
You were going to ask me
something.

1006
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,704
That's why you wanted
to have lunch.

1007
00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:15,841
Ron, you were going--

1008
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:19,678
- I was gonna ask you for a job.

1009
00:38:19,712 --> 00:38:21,980
In the federal government.

1010
00:38:22,015 --> 00:38:24,449
Just saying it out loud
feels dirty.

1011
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:28,587
You missed your friends,

1012
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:30,555
and you wanted to come up
to the third floor

1013
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,057
and work with us again.

1014
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:36,128
I can't even imagine how hard
that must have been for you.

1015
00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:38,096
God, why didn't I see that?

1016
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:41,033
Ron, I am so sorry.

1017
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:43,268
I should've been
a better friend to you.

1018
00:38:43,303 --> 00:38:46,038
Honestly, Leslie, it's fine.

1019
00:38:46,072 --> 00:38:48,774
It was a punctuation mark
on a sentence

1020
00:38:48,808 --> 00:38:50,008
that had already been written.

1021
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:52,277
My time in
government work was over.

1022
00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:53,912
Sure, I loved
shutting things down

1023
00:38:53,947 --> 00:38:56,748
and bleeding the rotting beast
from the inside.

1024
00:38:56,783 --> 00:38:59,051
Your metaphors are so beautiful.

1025
00:38:59,085 --> 00:39:00,419
But it was time for me to leave,

1026
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:02,554
and I didn't feel like
explaining why

1027
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:04,089
to you or anyone.

1028
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:05,891
Everything that happened
after--

1029
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:07,125
the fight we had,

1030
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,261
not giving you a heads-up
when my company took on

1031
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:10,696
the Morningstar development

1032
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:14,933
and bulldozed
the nurse's old house--

1033
00:39:14,968 --> 00:39:18,070
I do regret that.

1034
00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:20,939
I had a good run here.

1035
00:39:20,974 --> 00:39:25,911
But after you and Tom and Donna
and April and Terry left,

1036
00:39:25,945 --> 00:39:28,146
when I looked around
this office,

1037
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:30,382
nothing was the same.

1038
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,851
Yeah, well,
there's a way to fix that.

1054
00:40:35,114 --> 00:40:37,549
Oh. Morning, guys.

1055
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:38,984
Good morning, Leslie.

1056
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:40,352
What did you do to the office?

1057
00:40:40,386 --> 00:40:42,120
Ron, you're wearing
my yoga clothes.

1058
00:40:42,155 --> 00:40:43,455
You're gonna stretch out
the elastic.

1059
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:45,591
We're sorry.

1060
00:40:48,728 --> 00:40:50,863
♪ Fire and money and people ♪

1061
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:54,214
Hey.

1062
00:40:54,317 --> 00:40:56,415
I moved our meetings to tomorrow

1063
00:40:56,535 --> 00:41:00,872
because you are drunk
and hungover simultaneously

1064
00:41:00,906 --> 00:41:02,240
at 2:00 in the afternoon.

1065
00:41:02,274 --> 00:41:04,075
Yeah. Good call.

1066
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:06,143
Also, you have a visitor.

1067
00:41:06,178 --> 00:41:07,678
No, whoever it is,
I have zero interest in--

1068
00:41:07,713 --> 00:41:08,679
- Hello.

1069
00:41:08,714 --> 00:41:10,081
Ron!

1070
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:11,949
Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron.

1071
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:14,652
We just spent 12 hours
together, woman.

1072
00:41:14,686 --> 00:41:15,786
Mm, don't care.

1073
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:17,321
I have three years' worth
of hugs

1074
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:19,257
to force upon you
against your will.

1075
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,859
I have a small object for you.

1076
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:24,829
Call it an official
peace offering, I suppose.

1077
00:41:24,863 --> 00:41:27,165
Wow.
This is very sweet.

1078
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:30,034
But you do realize I gave<i> you</i>
this picture six hours ago.

1079
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:31,936
The frame is the gift.

1080
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,705
When my company took on
the Morningstar development,

1081
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,609
and I realized it meant
bulldozing Ann's old house,

1082
00:41:38,644 --> 00:41:40,378
I salvaged her front door.

1083
00:41:40,412 --> 00:41:41,445
Then I stripped off

1084
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,115
all the terrible paint
and lacquer--

1085
00:41:44,149 --> 00:41:46,817
people really don't know
how to finish wood properly--

1086
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:49,387
and I made it into
this frame for you

1087
00:41:49,421 --> 00:41:53,925
in the event that
you and I ever...

1088
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:54,959
Ron.

1089
00:41:54,993 --> 00:41:56,994
You big, fat, giant sap.

1090
00:41:57,029 --> 00:41:58,963
That seems unnecessary.

1091
00:41:58,997 --> 00:42:00,197
I love it.

1092
00:42:00,232 --> 00:42:01,232
But I feel bad.

1093
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:03,067
I don't have anything for you.

1094
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:05,203
I--For the first time
in my life,

1095
00:42:05,237 --> 00:42:06,504
I am present-less.

1096
00:42:06,538 --> 00:42:08,139
How 'bout you buy me a meal?

1097
00:42:08,173 --> 00:42:09,140
You hungry?

1098
00:42:09,174 --> 00:42:10,575
I'm starving.

1099
00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:12,677
April, Ron and I
are going to JJ's

1100
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:14,045
to eat too much breakfast food.

1101
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,113
Why does anybody in the world

1102
00:42:16,148 --> 00:42:18,983
ever eat anything
but breakfast food?

1103
00:42:19,017 --> 00:42:20,751
People are idiots, Ron.

1104
