1
00:00:03,173 --> 00:00:04,675
Forget it.

2
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:06,062
It's impossible.

3
00:00:06,096 --> 00:00:07,229
It's not gonna work
in a million years.

4
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:08,264
It's pointless.
I give up.

5
00:00:08,298 --> 00:00:09,432
Good attitude, honey.

6
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:11,067
Well, you know,
what do you want from me?

7
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:14,270
I'm trying to get a group
of people to give me their land,

8
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:18,140
rather than sell it to Gryzzl
for $90 million.

9
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:19,775
Right now, my basic argument is,

10
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,678
"Please, give us the land.
It would be so nice."

11
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:25,681
Gryzzl has billions of dollars.
There's no way I beat them.

12
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:28,384
Hey, I've seen you beat
tougher odds than this.

13
00:00:28,418 --> 00:00:31,220
But they're just a company,
they're not that powerful.

14
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:33,623
Whoa!

15
00:00:33,657 --> 00:00:36,125
"Open your door"?

16
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:38,294
Ah!

17
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:40,763
Oh, my God, Ben!
We're about to die.

18
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:42,365
- Good lord!
- Oh, my--

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,833
The robots have come for us.

20
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:45,268
I made fun of you
when you said it would happen

21
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:46,869
but your novel has come true.

22
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:47,937
Hey, Leslie Knope!

23
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:49,639
Please enjoy this free gift,

24
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:51,674
courtesy of Gryzzl.

25
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,909
Okay,
so they also have a squadron

26
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:57,480
of flying robots giving presents
to everyone.

27
00:00:57,514 --> 00:00:59,015
We're screwed.

28
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:10,059
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

29
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:21,037
New dish we're working on.

30
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:22,505
Tell me what you think.

31
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:25,474
It's a red and white heirloom
red bean pasta,

32
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:27,710
with an imported
Tuscan walnut herb sauce,

33
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:30,279
infused with shaved heritage
Pecorino Romano.

34
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:31,280
What?
You're done?

35
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:33,015
Mmm.
Really good.

36
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,983
Why are you doing new dishes?

37
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:38,721
Lucy is visiting her boyfriend
Conrad in Chicago,

38
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:40,156
so I'm just trying to distract
myself with work

39
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,024
so I don't think
about the marathon bone sesh

40
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:43,025
they're probably having.

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,993
Hey, you know what, dude?

42
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:45,027
You gotta take your mind
off of them.

43
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,796
Check this out.

44
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,497
It's a contract.

45
00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:50,199
It came from the station manager
where I do my show,

46
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:52,368
<i>Johnny Karate.</i>
He wants me to sign it,

47
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:55,371
but is says that they'll own
the character, "Johnny Karate."

48
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:57,873
And I want to own the character
Johnny Karate, 'cause it's me.

49
00:01:57,908 --> 00:01:59,976
Wait, this says they only pay
you a hundred bucks a week?

50
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,645
Yeah, but all I really do
is goof around all day.

51
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:04,347
Write, produce,
and direct a TV show.

52
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:07,483
Plus, I act in it,
and I do sets, props, wardrobe.

53
00:02:07,517 --> 00:02:09,318
At the end, I drive everybody
home, so I mean,

54
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:12,121
a hundred bucks a week--
that's pretty fair.

55
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:14,023
This is perfect.
I'll be your agent!

56
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:16,692
I'll put all my energy into
renegotiating your contract.

57
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:18,461
I won't even think
about Lucy and Conrad

58
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:22,131
and his stupid crunches
that he probably does.

59
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:25,067
I should probably do some
crunches.

60
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:26,102
Let's go!

61
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:28,838
Ow!
Andy, my tum tum!

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,140
Knope, I need to talk to you.

63
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:32,241
What's up?

64
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:34,010
I know I technically work
for Gryzzl,

65
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:35,912
but these fools
have crossed a line.

66
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:37,413
Have you gotten one of these
GryzzlBoxes?

67
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:39,415
Well, yeah,
but I haven't opened it yet.

68
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:42,251
Planning on sending it back
after I wrote a sternly-worded

69
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:44,954
letter about how I cannot be
bought with free gifts.

70
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:47,490
These are my free gifts.

71
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:49,325
Two honey bears...

72
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:51,928
and a canister of sugar plums.

73
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:54,563
"Honeybear" and "Sugar Plum"
are the special names

74
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:55,998
Joe and I call each other.

75
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,166
Aww.

76
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:59,468
Yeah, we're adorable,
but this is creepy.

77
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:01,137
Because we only call each other
these things

78
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:03,039
on the phone or in texts.

79
00:03:03,073 --> 00:03:05,574
How do they even know?

80
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:08,377
Leslie, open that box
they sent you.

81
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:11,447
Ooh! Joe Biden's book,
<i>"Biden the Rails:</i>

82
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:13,683
<i>1001 Poems</i>
<i>Inspired by My Travels</i>

83
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:15,151
<i>Through Amtrak's Northeat</i>
<i>Corridor."</i>

84
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:16,352
A thousand?

85
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,888
A poster of the Supreme Court
Justices

86
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:21,424
sipping the<i> Friends</i> milkshake!

87
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,925
This stuff is perfect for me.

88
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,494
Yeah, exactly.
They must be data-mining.

89
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:27,296
Searching our texts and emails

90
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:28,998
and gathering profiles
on all of us.

91
00:03:29,032 --> 00:03:31,167
This is a huge invasion
of privacy,

92
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,668
not to mention illegal.

93
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:34,770
When they installed their free
Wi-Fi in town,

94
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:37,740
I made sure that there was
language preventing this.

95
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:39,454
I never would have agreed
to work with them

96
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:41,644
if I had known they were gonna
be snooping in my biz.

97
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:43,613
Gryzzl is going down.

98
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:45,181
You wanna put me on blast?

99
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:46,582
I'ma put you on Front Street.

100
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:47,783
I don't understand what
that means,

101
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:50,286
but I think I get the context,
and I love it.

102
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:53,689
April, the new Parks interns
start today,

103
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:56,058
and I was wondering if you would
deliver a little welcome speech.

104
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,893
No, go away.

105
00:03:57,928 --> 00:04:01,264
Watermelon, martinis, exposed
brick, Keri Russell's hair.

106
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:03,299
Why did you just say those
weird things?

107
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,735
On the advice of my therapist,
Dr. Richard Nygard,

108
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,004
whenever I feel like yelling,
I just take a deep breath

109
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:10,306
and say three great things
about being alive.

110
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,309
- Gross.
- Please talk to my interns.

111
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:15,344
Fine.
Whatever, I'll do it.

112
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,046
I started here when I was 20,

113
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,949
and now I'm old and gross
and directionless.

114
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:22,552
Those kids are me ten years ago,

115
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:25,021
and this internship
is the videotape from<i> The Ring.</i>

116
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:27,356
It's too late for me.
I've seen too much.

117
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,825
But maybe I can save them.

118
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,762
You're all gonna die in here!

119
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:34,196
Hello, everyone.

120
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:36,666
We are here today
to discuss Gryzzl,

121
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,534
and whether or not they
are invading our privacy.

122
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,569
They sent my husband
three boxes of genital cream

123
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,071
to his office.

124
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:44,907
My husband's splotchy genitals
are no one's business,

125
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:48,511
except for his, mine,
and his many genital doctors.

126
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:53,582
They sent me a bunch of toy
pigs dressed like movie stars.

127
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:54,984
That's my private hobby.

128
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:58,321
No one knows I collect toy pigs
dressed like movie stars,

129
00:04:58,355 --> 00:04:59,922
except now all of you people.

130
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:01,157
Which one is that?

131
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:03,359
This is actually
Ham-uel L. Jackson

132
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:05,661
from the movie,<i> Pork Fiction,</i>
it's extremely rare,

133
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,029
and I am keeping it.

134
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:09,465
But still, they no right to give
me something I will treasure

135
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:11,167
the rest of my life.

136
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:13,536
I opened my box
in front of all of my friends,

137
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,339
and it was a bunch
of Virginia Woolf novels.

138
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:18,808
Now Miley and Haley
know I like to read.

139
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:20,209
What if they tell Evan?

140
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:22,712
I like their phones,
but they've gone too far

141
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:24,680
sending this stuff
to our houses.

142
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:27,283
Gryzzl has no right
to search our private data.

143
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:31,053
So wait, you guys are not
against us on this?

144
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:32,822
We're not against you on this.

145
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:35,458
We're not against you on this.

146
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:37,326
We're not against you
on this.

147
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:39,662
Finally, after months
of searching for a way

148
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:43,099
to defeat Gryzzl, we have found
its Achilles' heel.

149
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:45,835
The town is behind us,
Donna is on our side,

150
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:47,536
and the next domino to fall?

151
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:49,605
Ron Swanson.

152
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,242
Actually, this is Tom Sell-oink,
but, you know, close enough.

153
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:54,644
Actually,
I'm gonna need that back.

154
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:55,678
Oh, yes, of course.

155
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,622
February 2016--I think
you're gonna really enjoy

156
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:02,109
this month's photo album.

157
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:05,352
It includes such hits as:
"First Trip to the Dentist,"

158
00:06:05,472 --> 00:06:07,006
"Sonia Tries Pizza,"

159
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,476
and "Waterpark Vomit
Chain Reaction."

160
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,177
Why would you take pictures
of that?

161
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:12,912
- Why would you not?
- As you requested,

162
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:16,049
here's a picture of my son
at a recent moment in his life.

163
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,484
So cute--

164
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,554
What are you doing?
- Protecting my son's privacy.

165
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,490
What, I'm just gonna carry
around pictures of my child

166
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:24,824
where anyone could see them?

167
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,793
Well, it's funny you should
mention privacy

168
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:28,461
because that's our next topic.

169
00:06:28,495 --> 00:06:30,797
Ron technically works
for Gryzzl.

170
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:32,565
And when he finds out
what Gryzzl is doing,

171
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,935
he is going to lose. His. Mind.

172
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:39,606
- I have no reaction to this.
- What?

173
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,241
I do not pass judgment
on the workings

174
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,642
of private businesses.

175
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:44,144
I just build their buildings.

176
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:45,779
And frankly,
if people are foolish enough

177
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:47,247
to carry around a doodad

178
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,782
that lets Gryzzl
track their every move,

179
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:50,950
this is what they get.

180
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:52,719
But it's illegal.

181
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:54,153
I don't believe that's true.

182
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:55,288
I've spent a fair amount of time

183
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:56,643
with Gryzzl's high-priced
lawyers,

184
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:59,559
and they do seem to,
as they say,

185
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,361
"keep it 100."

186
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:03,696
Well, those fools
still think I work for them.

187
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:05,865
So I can get you a private VIP
tour of the building.

188
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,435
Maybe you can snoop around.

189
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,136
Hey there, homies, I'm Roscoe.

190
00:07:10,171 --> 00:07:11,638
Psyched to give you guys a tour.

191
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:14,073
Yes, hello,
I'm Darlene Johannsen,

192
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:16,176
and this is my
assistant-turned-lover,

193
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,810
Gregory Strong.

194
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:20,947
Ours is a new romance,
but one that sent shockwaves

195
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:22,649
through my architecture firm.

196
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:24,417
- But it feels so right.
- Steady.

197
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:28,188
We love Gryzzl, and we would
love to see how it all works.

198
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:31,391
Sweet.
Let's get loco.

199
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:34,561
Okay, so, let's get to know
each other.

200
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:36,262
Talk about why you're here,

201
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:37,697
whether you're throwing
your lives away,

202
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,365
stuff like that.

203
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,833
Uh, you, what brought you here?

204
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:42,135
I love the Parks department.

205
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:43,269
I grew up near Ramsett Park

206
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:44,537
and I used to go
to tons of stuff there.

207
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:45,939
Okay, that doesn't help me.

208
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:47,140
Uh, Mork?

209
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:48,575
Oh, it's Mike.

210
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:50,543
I love parks,
more than anything,

211
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:52,946
and I've been a summer camp
counselor since I was 13.

212
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,280
Ugh. Gross.

213
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:56,182
What about you?
Why are you here?

214
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:58,151
The only thing I love more
than parks is recreation.

215
00:07:58,185 --> 00:07:59,152
Really?

216
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:00,253
No, I just needed college
credit.

217
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:01,287
What are you studying?

218
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:02,288
Nothing.
College is stupid.

219
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:03,556
Then who made you do this.

220
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:05,458
- My parents.
- What are they like?

221
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:07,613
Well, my mom's the devil
and my dad's a dumb doctor.

222
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:09,562
- Oh, my dad's a doctor.
- Shut up.

223
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:11,030
- Jen is it?
- Yeah.

224
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:12,365
Let's take a walk, Jen.

225
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,467
I feel like you have
almost zero potential.

226
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:15,702
I think that's cool.

227
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:17,070
And action!

228
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:20,206
We meet again,
Puppy-Hating Dan.

229
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:21,741
You stole my guitar.

230
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:24,043
And you put farts in my lunch.

231
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,613
You've really done it this time.

232
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:28,515
Puppy Army, attack!

233
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,749
Yeah!

234
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:31,251
What? No!

235
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:32,919
I hate puppies.

236
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:34,587
I'll admit to everything.

237
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:36,156
You win again, Macklin.

238
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,891
Another mystery solved!

239
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:41,194
We'll be right back after this
with some more<i> Johnny Karate.</i>

240
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:42,295
Okay, that's lunch, everyone.

241
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:44,063
We're back in 30 minutes.

242
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:45,532
Great job, bud, you crushed it!

243
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,000
I love being Andy's agent.

244
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:49,836
He does all the work, and I get
10% just for showing up.

245
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,905
It's like a chef
at a restaurant,

246
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:54,240
making all the food, and then
the owner gets a profit--

247
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:56,309
which is my other job!

248
00:08:56,343 --> 00:08:58,678
Man, I really got things
figured out.

249
00:08:58,713 --> 00:08:59,946
Let's make this quick.

250
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,315
Andy's show gets huge ratings
in three cities.

251
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:05,018
His GryzzlTube page
has millions of views.

252
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:07,020
If you don't Andy walking over
to your rival station

253
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:10,190
in Snerling, I think you should
start taking this seriously.

254
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:12,492
Right. Okay,
here's what we're gonna do.

255
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:14,427
I'm gonna upgrade
the parking spot.

256
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:16,563
But my son gets a role
as one of the kid ninjas.

257
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,431
All right?
He's gonna love me for it.

258
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:20,500
It's gonna drive
my ex-wife crazy.

259
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:21,968
So far, so good, but, uh,

260
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,242
in the words of Jerry Maguire--

261
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,838
- "The human head weighs
8 pounds."

262
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:27,173
No.
"Show me the money."

263
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,309
Andy, do you know how lucky
you are to work here?

264
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,643
I'm a kingmaker.

265
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:34,981
Pep Wiley, Chuck Warschank,
Selena Gomez--I made them.

266
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:36,749
You discovered Selena Gomez?

267
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,051
Different Selena Gomez.

268
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:39,752
Look, I don't have the money
for a raise.

269
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,255
Uh, yeah you do.
I've seen profit reports.

270
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:45,125
The show's a bonanza.
Andy starts making 500 a week.

271
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,227
Now.

272
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:48,895
Get the hell out of my office,
both of you--

273
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,296
- Sit down.
- I don't...

274
00:09:50,331 --> 00:09:53,399
Look, dude, this internship
leads nowhere.

275
00:09:53,434 --> 00:09:57,203
It'll just screw up
the rest of your life.

276
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:59,205
- What do you love doing?
- Texting.

277
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,341
What did you want to be when
you were little?

278
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,344
A scary mermaid that lures
sailors to their death.

279
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:06,613
Okay, side note,
I'm gonna file papers

280
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,549
to adopt you as my child,
so keep an eye out for that.

281
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,619
But more importantly,
don't do this internship.

282
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,020
Go do something fun

283
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:16,556
like trying to control birds
with your mind

284
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:21,361
or posting internet comments
as Michael Jackson's ghost.

285
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:23,897
Okay.
Maybe you're right.

286
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:26,132
Thanks.

287
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,468
Hey, April, we finished those
questionnaires you gave us

288
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,170
about our hopes and dreams
for the internship.

289
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:33,606
Great!
Thanks, Mike!

290
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,211
Oh, I'm sorry this building
is so lame.

291
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:39,712
As soon as we get our new
headquarters built,

292
00:10:39,747 --> 00:10:41,347
it's gonna be way, way, tighter.

293
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:42,949
Check it.
Matty.

294
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:44,784
Okay, this is GryzzlVibe.

295
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:46,152
It's this new app
that we're developing

296
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,054
that monitors your mood.
Tell them about it.

297
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:51,124
As you know, the cameras
on your phones are always on,

298
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:52,125
whether you're using them
or not.

299
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,626
I'm sorry, they are?

300
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:56,496
This app uses facial
recognition software

301
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,064
to track your expressions.

302
00:10:58,099 --> 00:10:59,499
It's always watching.

303
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,335
Well, what do you do
with this information?

304
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:04,771
Well, if the camera senses
that you're in a bad mood,

305
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:07,140
then we can geo-match you to,
say, the nearest cup

306
00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:08,775
of sweet pick-me-up java.

307
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:12,345
But if you're in a good mood,
then we could geo-nudge you

308
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,980
to, like, a sweet coffee shop.

309
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:16,249
Just keep the good times
rolling.

310
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:18,451
So it's really just a coffee
sales app.

311
00:11:18,486 --> 00:11:19,752
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

312
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:20,887
Yeah, we're developing
with Starbucks.

313
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:21,888
Yeah.

314
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:24,290
So, Roscoe, how does Gryzzl

315
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,626
know all the things
that someone wants?

316
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,731
Are you guys...I don't know,
whatever--data-mining?

317
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:33,766
Oh, hells yeah, dog-man.

318
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:38,004
Our super rad algorithm searches
all your texts, calls, banking,

319
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:40,039
medical records,
blah, blah, blah,

320
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,442
to learn what you really want.

321
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:44,511
You know, from snacks
to new books and movies

322
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:47,280
to when you ladies need to score
some new 'pons.

323
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:50,116
I mean, we might know you better
than you know yourself, Leslie.

324
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,252
How did you know it was me?

325
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:53,853
Oh, there's about
40 different ways.

326
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:56,823
I mean, geo-maps on your
different Gryzzl devices,

327
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:58,658
and, of course, we face-scanned
you when you came in.

328
00:11:58,692 --> 00:11:59,726
Really glad you're here.

329
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,461
Okay, good.

330
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:03,429
Just 'cause we're competing
for the Newport land

331
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:04,898
doesn't mean that we can't be
friends.

332
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,299
- No.
- Isn't that your motto?

333
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,013
"Wouldn't it be tight
if everyone was chill

334
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:09,002
to each other?"

335
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:10,003
Totes.

336
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,571
And I hope that you can see now

337
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,773
that there's nothing scary
about Gryzzl.

338
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:16,276
I mean, we just wanna learn
everything about everyone

339
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,550
and track them wherever they go

340
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:19,712
and anticipate what they're
about to do.

341
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:21,981
These are really interesting
issues, Roscoe.

342
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:24,851
I think maybe we could debate
them, you know?

343
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:27,454
- On TV.
- TV. Retro.

344
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:29,155
I love it.
All right.

345
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,192
I'm gonna GryzzlPad out of here.

346
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:33,226
Later, chillerz.

347
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:39,130
This is <i>The Perdples Court,</i>

348
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:42,200
a legal debate show
about issues facing residents

349
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,701
of Southern Indiana.

350
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:46,738
With your host,
Judge Perd Hapley.

351
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:48,506
Tonight, on <i>The Perdples Court,</i>

352
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,508
we will have the guests
that have been booked

353
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:51,943
for tonight's show--

354
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:54,679
the plaintiff, Leslie Knope,
who has some big allegations

355
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:55,813
against Gryzzl.

356
00:12:55,848 --> 00:12:57,882
The defendant,
Gryzzl Vice President

357
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,350
Roscoe Santangelo.

358
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:01,152
Who will win?
I don't know yet.

359
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:03,121
Which is what makes
this a court show.

360
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:05,223
We have public opinion
on our side,

361
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:07,291
and we have proof that Gryzzl
has been data-mining.

362
00:13:07,326 --> 00:13:08,960
But there's one more thing
we need.

363
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:13,264
The one thing that Americans
respect more than anything else:

364
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:16,634
public humiliation
on live television.

365
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:19,604
Leslie, don't humiliate
yourself on television.

366
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:20,938
Swanson, what are you doing
here?

367
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:23,841
This is the 27th version
of the Pawnee-Gryzzl

368
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:26,177
free wireless internet thing
agreement.

369
00:13:26,211 --> 00:13:28,413
Check out the page I marked.

370
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,049
Yeah, "Gryzzl is not allowed
to collect and use customer data

371
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,518
for any purpose."
It's pretty clear. See?

372
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:37,088
Look closer, amendment "C,"
addendum 14.

373
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:41,092
It directs you to this appendix,
which reroutes you to this one

374
00:13:41,126 --> 00:13:44,595
which says, in a sub-footnote:

375
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,697
It says here
they can gather and use

376
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:47,598
any information they want.

377
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:49,400
How did I miss this?

378
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:50,601
Look at the revision date.

379
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:53,371
December 18, 2015.

380
00:13:53,405 --> 00:13:56,641
That was the opening day
of<i> Star Wars: Episode VII.</i>

381
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:59,077
You were muttering that date
in your sleep for months.

382
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:02,013
They knew you'd be distracted.
That's how they slipped it in.

383
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:03,614
I did this to the town.

384
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,383
It's my fault.

385
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:09,654
It's Ice Town all over again.

386
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:14,192
Is <i>Star Wars</i> the one
with the little wizard boy?

387
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:16,594
Okay, this is what
I can give you.

388
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:19,797
No more janitorial duties,
better parking spot,

389
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:22,600
unlimited Mike and Ikes
from the vending machine,

390
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:25,036
and for salary,
we're at 500 a week.

391
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,504
500 whats?

392
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:28,039
Dollars, man.

393
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:29,507
What about the rights
to Johnny Karate?

394
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,808
We own the rights
to Johnny Karate

395
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:32,110
I can't bend on that one.

396
00:14:32,144 --> 00:14:33,578
But I invented the character.

397
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:34,579
Well, invent another character.

398
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:37,415
Uh, here you go:
Kung-Fu Billy.

399
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:38,850
Jeremy Punch-Guy.

400
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:40,151
Ed Kick.

401
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:42,120
Those are actually pretty great.

402
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:44,589
But Johnny Karate
is special to me.

403
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:48,593
If we can't get the rights,
I'm gonna walk.

404
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,495
He's making the biggest
mistake of his life.

405
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:52,196
He's walking out on Hank Muntak?

406
00:14:52,231 --> 00:14:54,365
I have six Lower Great Lakes
Emmy Awards.

407
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,401
I once sat in the original
Batmobile.

408
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:59,670
James Woods follows my niece
on Twitter.

409
00:14:59,705 --> 00:15:01,072
He's gonna regret this.

410
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:03,141
All this work,
everything I've done

411
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:05,376
for this city,
it's all a wash now.

412
00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:06,778
Everyone's gonna hate me again.

413
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:08,546
Some of us are already there,
Wyatt.

414
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,816
This is not your fault.
Ron, talk some sense into him.

415
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,185
Ben's right.
This is Ice Town all over again.

416
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:15,319
- I--
- Ron!

417
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:16,587
If you're gonna sign

418
00:15:16,622 --> 00:15:17,956
a legally binding document,

419
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,557
you need to read it thoroughly.

420
00:15:19,591 --> 00:15:21,292
That's why the only contract
I've ever signed

421
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:23,861
is my Mulligan's Steakhouse
club card.

422
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:26,197
And even then,
I used a fake name.

423
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:27,532
Les.

424
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,400
Les Vegetables.

425
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:30,702
Don't worry, okay?

426
00:15:30,736 --> 00:15:32,370
You're not gonna take the fall
for this.

427
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:35,339
Ron, make sure that Donna
doesn't hurt him.

428
00:15:36,775 --> 00:15:37,909
You wanted to see me?

429
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:40,011
Yes, can you tell me where
Jennifer is?

430
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:41,279
I convincer her to quit.

431
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:43,414
Martha Stewarts apron line,

432
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:46,050
my tomato plants--
oh, God, I'm out!

433
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:47,318
Where is my emergency list?

434
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:49,087
Recently, I've been feeling

435
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:51,489
like I've wasted
the last ten years of my life,

436
00:15:51,523 --> 00:15:53,224
and it all started
with this internship,

437
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:56,227
and I don't want those kids to
make the same mistake, okay?

438
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:58,796
April, you spent the last
ten years doing amazing things

439
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:00,231
with this Parks department,
and learning

440
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:01,966
from the greatest teacher
in this or any business,

441
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,768
Leslie Freaking Knope!

442
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:05,403
You'd be a checkout girl
at a gas station

443
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:07,739
if it wasn't for that
internship.

444
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:11,909
Sweet potato pie, unlikely
animal friend pairings,

445
00:16:11,944 --> 00:16:14,278
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

446
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:15,880
You're lucky to have worked
here,

447
00:16:15,914 --> 00:16:18,182
no matter what you want to do
with the rest of your life.

448
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:20,351
And I think you know that.

449
00:16:20,386 --> 00:16:25,423
And now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go find a new intern.

450
00:16:25,457 --> 00:16:27,825
Now Leslie, I understand
that what you've brought

451
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,061
to the show
isn't a box of objects

452
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:32,897
but rather a symbolic box
of allegations.

453
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:36,234
- Well, Perd--
- It's "Judge Perd."

454
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:39,070
Okay, uh, I think there are
certain questions

455
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:44,509
about certain aspects of certain
parts of this situation

456
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:49,614
that require an evaluation
about whether or not

457
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:52,583
this is or is not a valid
argument.

458
00:16:52,618 --> 00:16:54,319
Extremely well-put.

459
00:16:54,353 --> 00:16:56,020
Excuse me, Judge Perd?

460
00:16:56,055 --> 00:16:57,822
I'm Ben Wyatt, City Manager.

461
00:16:57,856 --> 00:17:00,658
What Gryzzl is doing with our
private information

462
00:17:00,692 --> 00:17:05,596
may not technically be illegal,
but it's definitely not chill.

463
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:08,199
Whoa! That's a serious
allegaysh, homie.

464
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:09,400
We are hella chill.

465
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:11,836
And frankly,
if you don't like our vibe,

466
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,204
you don't have to use our shizz.

467
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:15,139
Well, we kind of do.

468
00:17:15,174 --> 00:17:17,075
I mean, the internet
is no longer optional,

469
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,544
it's a necessity for everyone.

470
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:22,714
And I think you do know
that data-mining isn't chill,

471
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:25,850
because you snuck it
into the 27th update

472
00:17:25,884 --> 00:17:29,821
of a 500-page user agreement.

473
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,291
A person should not have to have
an advanced law degree

474
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:35,126
to avoid being taken
advantage of

475
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,862
by a multibillion dollar
company.

476
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:41,065
You should be upfront
about what you're doing

477
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,969
and allow people the ability
to opt out.

478
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:49,707
To be honest, Judge Perd
is stumped by this case.

479
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:52,677
I've also misplaced
my judge hammer.

480
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:54,245
I cannot render a verdict here.

481
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:57,615
Therefore, I must declare
a mistrial, which is a term

482
00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:00,118
I've heard people use
in the movies.

483
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:02,453
Tap, tap, tap.
Case ended.

484
00:18:02,488 --> 00:18:04,188
And we're clear.

485
00:18:04,223 --> 00:18:05,307
All right, later, dudes.

486
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:11,309
Hey, good news!
I think I found a job.

487
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:12,310
There was an opening

488
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:13,310
for a janitor at the TV station.

489
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,013
Get this--they're gonna pay me
the minimum wage.

490
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:16,815
Put your mop down, bud.

491
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:18,183
I got you the rights
to Johnny Karate.

492
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:19,884
No way!
How?

493
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:21,897
Just a great agent I guess.

494
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:23,633
Please, man, please!

495
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,901
Andy's my friend,
and I want to do a good job,

496
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:27,403
and there's this girl
I really like,

497
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:30,506
and she lives in Chicago,
and she's still dating someone,

498
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,008
- and I just feel like--
- Oh, God.

499
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:33,576
Do you want to eat
at my restaurant for free?

500
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,544
Every week, you could come once
a week, and it's free.

501
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:38,047
Okay, okay, fine.
J-just stop!

502
00:18:38,081 --> 00:18:40,216
See?

503
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,584
I told you it was gonna
work out.

504
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:42,952
That's actually really good
advice for anything.

505
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:45,755
If there's something
that you want badly,

506
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:48,624
you just have to believe
that it's gonna work out.

507
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:55,197
Hey, I am sorry that I screwed
up your life.

508
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:58,601
I found a bunch of new potential
interns to replace Jen.

509
00:18:58,635 --> 00:18:59,669
Hi.

510
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:00,870
How'd you manage that?

511
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:03,072
I just thought,
"What would Leslie do?"

512
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:06,742
So I handed out flyers
and I canvassed the college.

513
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:08,544
I even baked a bunch of cookies.

514
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:11,647
It was weird, I actually enjoyed
finding them.

515
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:14,216
And I enjoyed bullying Jen
into quitting.

516
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:16,171
Hmm. You should add
"telling people what to do"

517
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:17,920
to your "perfect job"
description.

518
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:19,221
Good idea.

519
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:20,990
You should up your therapy
to seven times a week,

520
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:23,759
stop dressing that way,
and give me your wallet.

521
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:27,563
Victor Garber, James Garner,
Jennifer Garner.

522
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:29,265
I go alphabetical now.

523
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:32,435
Hey, you're back!
How was the trip?

524
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:35,071
It was okay.
Kind of weird.

525
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:36,605
Oh. Weird couple of days
for me too.

526
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,208
Closed a bunch of deals,
did a bunch of crunches...

527
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:41,777
Yeah, I broke up with Conrad.

528
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:45,314
Which was a long time coming,
but still weird.

529
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:48,084
So yeah, uh,
do you want to talk about it?

530
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:50,753
Thanks. I don't think I'm
ready to discuss it just yet.

531
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:53,389
But what I would like to do
is have a glass of wine

532
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:54,957
and talk about that shade
Nicki Minaj

533
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:56,926
threw at Jesse Eisenberg
at the BAFTA awards.

534
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,995
- Mm. He deserved it.
- No. he didn't!

535
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:00,396
Uh, settle in,

536
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,999
because I have some very strong
feelings about this.

537
00:20:04,534 --> 00:20:06,535
They're all down.

538
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,638
Thank God.
Sometimes I think they're

539
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:10,506
somehow the first humans
who don't need sleep.

540
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,808
Look, this Gryzzl thing,
it's complicated.

541
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:15,277
But this isn't Ice Town.

542
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:16,912
You have done so much
for this town,

543
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:18,981
and people know that.

544
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:20,449
I'm just sorry we couldn't
find something

545
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:21,951
illegal on Gryzzl.

546
00:20:21,985 --> 00:20:23,719
If we're gonna stop them,
and you're gonna beat them

547
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:26,622
on the Newport land,
we need more ammo.

548
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:34,096
We need to talk.

549
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:35,331
What is that?

550
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:38,100
This is a flying robot
I just shot out of the sky

551
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:40,436
after it delivered a package
to my house.

552
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,239
I thought you didn't like
to pass judgment on business--

553
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:46,142
- The package was addressed
to my son,

554
00:20:46,176 --> 00:20:48,077
who is four years old,

555
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:50,880
and does not own
a Gryzzl doodad.

556
00:20:50,914 --> 00:20:53,393
Somehow the robots looked
at Diane's computer

557
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:55,247
and learned something about my child

558
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:56,979
and then brought him a box of presents,

559
00:20:57,283 --> 00:20:59,079
so I destroyed the robot.

560
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,712
No one is safe from these bastards.

561
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:03,740
Tell me what to do, Leslie.

562
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:06,703
I wanna help you take them down.

563
00:21:06,823 --> 00:21:10,571
