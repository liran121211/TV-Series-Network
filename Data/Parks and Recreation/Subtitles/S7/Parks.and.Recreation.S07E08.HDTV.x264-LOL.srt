1
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:05,146
Okay, the central question that the senators
are gonna be asking is,

2
00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:07,638
"Why should we invest in
the National Parks Service?"

3
00:00:07,672 --> 00:00:09,540
- April...
- Well, it is simple, Leslie.

4
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:11,075
In today's fast-paced society,

5
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:12,876
national parks are still
the best place

6
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:15,312
for full moon
werewolf transformations.

7
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:16,313
I know you're kidding.

8
00:00:16,348 --> 00:00:17,748
But I also know that
you're prepared

9
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:19,416
and we are going to do great.

10
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:20,851
How psyched are you
about this trip?

11
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:23,587
April, are you super psyched?

12
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:26,123
Yeah. Also you have
lipstick on your teeth.

13
00:00:26,157 --> 00:00:27,791
I do? Mm, okay.
Good looking out.

14
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:29,026
We're a great team.

15
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,694
Well, I never thought
I'd say this,

16
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:33,464
but I think I know
what's going on in your head.

17
00:00:33,498 --> 00:00:36,467
Oh, well then,
welcome to the terror dome.

18
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:39,403
Okay, you need to tell Leslie
that you want to leave your job.

19
00:00:39,437 --> 00:00:42,406
No. She freaks out
when anything changes.

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,441
One time Andy told her that
I was getting rid of my bangs

21
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:45,843
and she called 9-1-1.

22
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:47,645
Okay, well, I can't
keep your secret much longer.

23
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,680
Anytime your name comes up,
I panic

24
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:51,949
and change the subject to
the <i> Twin Peaks </i> reboot

25
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:53,217
'til she gets bored.

26
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:54,551
So you talk for one second?

27
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:56,387
You're gonna spend
the next couple days with her.

28
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:58,489
If you talk to her
directly and honestly,

29
00:00:58,523 --> 00:01:00,758
she can be
surprisingly open-minded.

30
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:01,959
Oh, really? Oh, okay.

31
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:04,094
Hey, Leslie, um, I was
thinking about changing

32
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,563
the font on the itineraries.

33
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:06,597
What do you think?

34
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:07,965
What? Why?

35
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:10,134
On what grounds?
Those--those fonts are perfect.

36
00:01:10,168 --> 00:01:12,603
It's readable and compact,
it's all on one page.

37
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:14,438
That's insane.
Don't mess with that.

38
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:16,473
I mean, I appreciate
your initiative,

39
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:20,244
but itineraries are not
the right place to mess around.

40
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:24,248
Yeah. April, I told you,
that was an absurd idea.

41
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:35,226
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

42
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:46,403
I don't care what Ben says.

43
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:48,205
I'm not going to tell Leslie
I'm leaving my job

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,841
on this trip. She'll drown me
in the Potomac...

45
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,877
while she recites facts
about the Potomac.

46
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:55,346
Well don't fret, cookie.
We've made progress, haven't we?

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,548
We got a whole list of all
the things you need

48
00:01:57,582 --> 00:01:58,883
out of a new job.

49
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:01,752
Apple juice, barbeque sauce,

50
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:03,220
Count Chocula--
wait.

51
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:05,135
Oh, sorry, that's the list
of cool new nicknames

52
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:06,190
I want people to call me.

53
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:07,992
Here's your list.

54
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:09,126
How can I tell her I'm leaving

55
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,028
when I don't even know
what job I want?

56
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:13,797
Babe, I wish you
were coming with me.

57
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:15,332
I just decided what
I am going to do

58
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:16,448
while April is out of town.

59
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:19,304
I'm going to round up the team
and find her a new job.

60
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:21,006
Yeah, Ben Wyatt please?

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,143
Tell him it's Count Chocula.

62
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:27,879
Uh, no it's Andrew Dwyer.
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:29,447
So April wants to leave?

64
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:33,018
I always knew she
would tire of government.

65
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,185
Took long enough.

66
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,253
Well, both me and Ben

67
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,721
are trying to help April
find a new job,

68
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,290
and we thought maybe
she could work for you.

69
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,326
I feel like it would be
a perfect fit.

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,995
Although, I don't know exactly
what you guys do here.

71
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,865
I'm guessing...

72
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:48,066
it's a business?

73
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,535
Assassins? Hit men?

74
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,604
Doctors. You guys
are doctors.

75
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:54,439
We build things.

76
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:56,408
Come on, let me show you around.

77
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:00,979
This is a door.
These, of course, are walls.

78
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:03,014
What else?
What else? Ah!

79
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,116
Meet our Vice President,
Don Swanson.

80
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,551
Don, this is Andrew
and Benjamin.

81
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:07,852
Pleasure to meet you.

82
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,655
Is this your brother?

83
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,091
You have a brother.

84
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,193
No.

85
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:18,597
Fine. Yes. I suppose
the cat's out of the bag.

86
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,533
I have a brother.
One brother.

87
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,301
All those years together
at the Parks department

88
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,936
and you never told us
you had a brother.

89
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,104
You worked at
the Parks department?

90
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:27,806
Tour's over!

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,810
Okay. Carry-on bag's packed.
Trashy magazines purchased.

92
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,113
Boarding passes in hand,
and we have 26 minutes

93
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:36,915
for unstructured chat time.

94
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:37,983
What do you want to talk about?

95
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,485
I don't know.
Nothing.

96
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,520
I thought maybe we could
talk about your future.

97
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,290
Wanna talk about your future?

98
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:47,859
Yeah. I've actually been
thinking about that

99
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:49,461
- a lot lately.
- Yeah, I figured.

100
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,963
It's hard, at your age,
to figure out your path.

101
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,198
- I know.
- Yeah.

102
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,899
I was gonna surprise you
with this in Washington,

103
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,967
but, you know, what the heck?

104
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,535
It's unstructured chat time.

105
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,338
So...
ta-da!

106
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,108
This is your clear,
definitive path

107
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,276
through the federal government.

108
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,045
It starts here today
with this flight

109
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,014
and it goes all the way to 2022.

110
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,281
Cool, right?

111
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,284
Wow. This is intense.

112
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,019
I had to make some guesses about

113
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,720
your ultimate government
objectives

114
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,689
and your fashion choices,
etcetera,

115
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:19,491
but the point is with this

116
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,992
you don't have to worry.

117
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,728
I know!
I feel so relaxed.

118
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,996
Yeah! I know!

119
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,565
What's up with these shirts?

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,900
Gov Buds for Life?

121
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,969
Just a little fun I was having,
you know?

122
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:33,805
I didn't really make the shirts.

123
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,006
But did you though?

124
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,575
Yes, I did!

125
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,878
Ha-ha! Ta-da!

126
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,548
Oh, and also,
I have a middle seat.

127
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:47,619
April!
Group one is boarding!

128
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:52,125
Break it down. What will she be
doing at this job?

129
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,623
Well, she'd have about six
people reporting to her.

130
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:56,777
And if she started soon,
she could project manage

131
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,479
our new warehouse in Snerling.

132
00:04:58,513 --> 00:05:00,614
Get to be my own boss.
So far, so good.

133
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:04,618
She also wants passionate
interest in subject matter.

134
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:07,254
So, what kind of building is it?

135
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:08,956
It's a large scale storage unit

136
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,658
for surplus vinyl sheeting.

137
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:14,028
Okay. So that's, uh,
boring.

138
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:15,996
Would she have
an opportunity to practice

139
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,932
any creative problem solving?

140
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:21,869
Creativity is for people
with glasses who like to lie.

141
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:24,839
Although, I suppose she could
use creative ways

142
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:27,408
to organize and stack
the vinyl sheeting.

143
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:28,876
No, that's insane.

144
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,512
We use the Towsend method.
It's tried and true.

145
00:05:31,546 --> 00:05:33,214
I think this might
be a dead end.

146
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:34,815
I think you might be right.

147
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,584
But getting a good person
out of government

148
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:38,285
is a worthwhile endeavor.

149
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,755
I will help, but first
I'm gonna need some grub.

150
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:43,090
Ooh, yeah! Let's grab some
lunch and some ice cream!

151
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,825
Then maybe some
after ice cream tacos?

152
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,780
We'll just brainstorm and
maybe grab some snacks.

153
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:48,129
Vaughn, Lon.

154
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:49,330
Ron.

155
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,468
Okay, I think we're all set.

156
00:05:54,503 --> 00:05:55,803
Even though I'm taking the lead
on these meetings,

157
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:57,271
- don't be afraid to jump in.
- Copy that.

158
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:59,707
April, when Randy brings up
the river project,

159
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:01,976
- that is your cue to--
- Distract the guards

160
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,079
so the Hamburglar can
make his escape.

161
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:07,281
We're meeting with
a lot of senators today.

162
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:08,516
- Is she going to be okay?
- Yeah.

163
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,118
It's just April.
Trust me.

164
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:13,821
And we hope you agree that
this is the best plan

165
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:15,022
to preserve
national parks' funding

166
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:16,690
into the next decade.

167
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,086
Well, so Leslie,
what do you think?

168
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:19,660
Is--is this the right move?

169
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:21,695
Well, I think it's the only
move, Senator Boxer.

170
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,732
I don't think this chance
is gonna come around again.

171
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:27,268
Well, you know,
if it's good with Leslie,

172
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:28,869
it's good with me.

173
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:30,671
Well, I have another great idea.

174
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:32,873
How about you and me,
April, Randy,

175
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:34,875
historical lamp posts of D.C.?

176
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,211
Walking tour
starts in 15 minutes.

177
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:38,579
Sounds great, but, uh,

178
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:41,682
I do have an appointment
with the President.

179
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:42,950
Can we come?

180
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,219
What kind of a business is this?

181
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:48,222
Is it like hit men
or astronauts?

182
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:50,324
It's an accounting firm.

183
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:52,493
But they recently opened up
a consulting wing.

184
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,128
And consulting is perfect
for April.

185
00:06:54,162 --> 00:06:56,096
You think this Barney fellow
will listen

186
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:57,431
to what we have to say?

187
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:59,300
Ben! Ben is here!

188
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:00,801
Hi, Ben!

189
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:02,670
Ted! Ben is here!

190
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:06,540
Hey, it is actuarially very good
to see you guys.

191
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:08,843
Aah! Ha ha!

192
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:10,077
Ben!

193
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:13,214
- They like me here.
- You gotta hear this!

194
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:15,293
So we think we can
keep costs down

195
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:16,433
and still meet deadlines.

196
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,187
You know, I have to say
I'm really impressed

197
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,256
with what you guys are doing
over at Interior.

198
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,357
Thank you, Senator Gillibrand,

199
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:22,591
we really appreciate
your support.

200
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:24,326
Would you mind signing
a copy of your book?

201
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,694
Oh, of course, of course.

202
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:26,795
I took the liberty of
writing the inscription.

203
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,997
All you have to do is sign.

204
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,799
"To Leslie, my inspiration,
my muse,

205
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,102
my partner in crime.
I owe it all to you."

206
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:35,404
And there's room for a P.S.
if you feel

207
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:37,039
there's more you left out.

208
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:39,508
Well, I think I've said all
I wanna say right here.

209
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,243
- Okay.
- Okay.

210
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:43,345
Yeah, well, I can't do
that right now.

211
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,881
Oh, boy.
I'll call you back.

212
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,983
Hello, Senator.
Do you have a minute to chat?

213
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:49,518
Oh, I can't right now.
I've got a meeting.

214
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,353
Well, actually, I checked
with your staff

215
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,789
and they said that
you have a free half hour.

216
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:55,357
Did anyone ever tell you

217
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,726
that your tenacity
can be intimidating?

218
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:59,929
Yes. Every month of my life
since fourth grade.

219
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,931
Now, let's talk about
national parks.

220
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:04,300
Well, I just have to say
I'm very surprised

221
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:07,002
that the two of you are
seeing eye to eye on this one.

222
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:08,737
Well, Senator Buckner and I are
both concerned

223
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:10,773
about our nation's resources.

224
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:13,175
And that absolutely includes
our national parks.

225
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,244
But that's not all we
have in common.

226
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:18,681
In fact, our real passion is...

227
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,584
Polynesian folk music.

228
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:23,085
W--what?

229
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,420
Polynesian folk music.

230
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:26,288
Our band is playing in
Georgetown tonight

231
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:27,299
if you'd like to come.

232
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:29,615
We're called
"Across the Isle."

233
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,584
Did you get that?
Aisle? Isle?

234
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:33,919
Like an island and then
across the aisle,

235
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:35,121
the political aisle.

236
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:37,089
It's like a pun.
It's a play on words.

237
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:38,290
- I do get it.
- Are you sure?

238
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:39,605
We are definitely
coming to this.

239
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,961
It's $8.00
if you buy your tickets now.

240
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:43,295
It's $10.00 at the door.

241
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,065
Fiscal conservative.
Love this guy.

242
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:47,066
- Love this guy.
- Yeah.

243
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,268
April Ludgate Dwyer.

244
00:08:49,303 --> 00:08:50,669
She worked on the Gryzzl deal

245
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:52,371
that you guys did
the finances for.

246
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,207
Now, I know that you're
opening up a consulting wing,

247
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:57,843
and we just think that April
would be a great hire.

248
00:08:57,878 --> 00:09:00,046
Yeah, and here's the thing,
Barney.

249
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,281
We're obviously very familiar
with what consulting is

250
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:03,516
but why don't you go ahead
and tell my friends here,

251
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,818
because I don't think
that they know.

252
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:09,021
Well, it's really about finding
creative solutions

253
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:11,190
to difficult problems.

254
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:14,627
Now, a lot of times
there's firings, so...

255
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:17,330
consultants aren't
exactly well liked.

256
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:19,598
Holy crap. This is the job
for her, I can feel it.

257
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,267
She'll take it!
Now let's talk perks.

258
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:22,735
Does she get the summers off?
Is it like school?

259
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:23,810
- Son, easy.
- Well,

260
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:25,582
what did she major in?

261
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:27,684
Economics? Accounting?

262
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,386
She designed her own major.

263
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:32,089
- "Halloween Studies."
- Trust me, Barney.

264
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:34,792
She's brilliant and
a very fast learner.

265
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:37,861
Does that, uh,
compound your interests?

266
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:39,496
Huh?

267
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:41,031
Ha ha!

268
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:43,467
So what do you say?
Huh, Barney?

269
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:46,170
- Oh, Ben, that was amazing.
- Thank you.

270
00:09:46,204 --> 00:09:48,338
But it's too late
for her to apply.

271
00:09:48,373 --> 00:09:51,308
I'm sorry but we're not really
taking any more applicants.

272
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:55,746
Though I could make an exception
for someone else.

273
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,715
Not interested.

274
00:09:57,749 --> 00:09:59,917
Okay, so five
yeses and four nos.

275
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:01,552
Not a bad start.

276
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:02,820
So, Leslie, I was going to talk
to you about this

277
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:05,489
in a few weeks,
but Mike Norbert is retiring.

278
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:08,726
Oh, really?
'Ol Norbs is stepping down.

279
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,794
Couldn't handle the pressure,
huh? What a wuss.

280
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:12,129
His marriage is falling apart.

281
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:13,697
Oh--oh, okay.

282
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:14,965
She had an affair
with his best friend.

283
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,500
Ooh, okay, I feel bad about
what I said before.

284
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:17,534
Yeah, I get it, I get it.

285
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:19,236
So, anyway,
the good news for you is

286
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,471
we'd like to promote you
to Deputy Director

287
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:23,640
of Operations and Interior.

288
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:25,008
Wow.

289
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:26,810
You'd have to move to D.C.
and you have to complete

290
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:29,213
the Senior Executive Service
Candidate Development program.

291
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,581
I have to enroll
in S.E.S.C.D.P.?

292
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:33,183
44 weeks of intensive courses
and note taking?

293
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:35,753
Um, it's a dream come true.

294
00:10:35,787 --> 00:10:37,755
And I have to warn you, there'll
be a confirmation hearing.

295
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:39,990
A confirmation hearing?
A freaking confirmation hearing?

296
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:41,558
Excuse me a second.

297
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:42,926
What's that?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

298
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:45,028
Um, to the best of my
recollection,

299
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,997
yes, I accept the job.

300
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:48,365
Oh, excuse me, ma'am?

301
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,833
Do you mind if
I borrow your hat?

302
00:10:49,868 --> 00:10:51,502
I just want to throw it up in
the air victoriously.

303
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:53,170
- No.
- Ma'am!

304
00:10:55,206 --> 00:10:56,907
I think that job's
perfect for April.

305
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:58,942
We just have to convince Barney
to give her a shot.

306
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:01,011
I mean, first problem,
she's not as qualified

307
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,312
as the other applicants.

308
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:04,415
Simple solution.
I break into her college

309
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:06,984
and I change her degree
to accounting. Easy.

310
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:09,820
On my way out, look up at
the blackboard, what is that?

311
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:11,622
Impossible math equation?

312
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:12,756
I solve it.

313
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,058
X equals Y, obviously.

314
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:16,660
Professor comes up to me
and says,

315
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:20,330
"I've been working on that
for 50 years.

316
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:24,401
Why don't you accept
this math trophy?"

317
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:26,603
By the time he turns around,
I'm gone.

318
00:11:26,638 --> 00:11:28,872
We need to highlight
April's strengths.

319
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:30,441
I thought we could update
her resume.

320
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:32,810
This is the one
she applied to Parks with.

321
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:36,080
It's just a signed photograph
of a puppet named Alf.

322
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:38,348
Okay, so, we make
her an actual resume

323
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:39,817
then put on a big presentation.

324
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:42,419
Show Barney that
she's more than qualified.

325
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:43,720
Gonna need all hands on deck.

326
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:45,956
That's Craig, Donna,
and most importantly--

327
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:47,724
- Please no.
- Come on, don't do it.

328
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,626
Oh, you wanna photocopy?

329
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:52,062
You guys want to do
all the mindless work?

330
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:54,398
Yeah, I didn't think so.

331
00:11:56,134 --> 00:11:58,402
Get me Garry Gergich.

332
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:01,338
Look around, April.

333
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:03,107
What do you see?

334
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:04,942
Fountains.

335
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,644
Water.

336
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:08,312
Sky.

337
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:10,881
You...looking at me
like a crazy person.

338
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:14,151
I see a new home.
I am gonna take that job.

339
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:17,388
Ben's gonna run for Congress,
he will win eventually,

340
00:12:17,422 --> 00:12:18,722
and then we're gonna
split our time

341
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:20,124
between Washington and Pawnee.

342
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:22,326
That's great. It looks like
everything is

343
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,327
falling into place for you.

344
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:24,695
For us, April!

345
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:26,063
- For us!
- Oh, God.

346
00:12:26,097 --> 00:12:27,164
Whoa! What is that?

347
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:28,966
Over there, a lamp post?

348
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,240
Is that historic, do you think?

349
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:31,769
No. They put that in
in the 70s.

350
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:33,737
Look, I am so ahead
of my five-year plan.

351
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:36,807
Which means that you're gonna
need a new five-year plan,

352
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,142
And here it is.

353
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:40,744
Ow, it's hot! How did you
make this so fast?

354
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,414
I keep a local binder maker
on retainer in D.C.

355
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:46,517
We are about to embark on
such an amazing journey.

356
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:49,920
This is gonna be our city.
And this is gonna be our bench.

357
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:53,123
April, we have a bench
in D.C.!

358
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:55,793
I'm sorry, Leslie,
I can't do this anymore.

359
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:57,628
I don't want to work
in government.

360
00:12:57,662 --> 00:12:58,829
I quit.

361
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,400
What are you talking about?

362
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:05,002
You quit? Why?

363
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:08,505
Because, honestly,
I don't even know if I like

364
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,207
working in national parks.

365
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:11,408
Or government.

366
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:13,911
I just fell backwards
into your world

367
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:17,047
and years have gone by,
and now I'm here

368
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:18,482
and--Andy and Ben have been
helping me

369
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:19,917
look into different jobs
to figure out

370
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:21,452
what I really want to do.

371
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:23,053
Ben who? Ben Wyatt?

372
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:25,122
He's been helping you
behind my back?

373
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:27,191
Wow, okay, you know what,
we had a good run,

374
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,525
- but he's dead to me now.
- It's just--

375
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,594
I've been on this weird path
my entire adult life,

376
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:32,730
and I need to figure out
what I really want.

377
00:13:32,764 --> 00:13:34,264
I cannot believe
you're quitting.

378
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:36,367
And I cannot believe this is the
first time I'm hearing it.

379
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:38,736
And on our bench...

380
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,755
of all places.

381
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:50,350
You know, it's just
so frustrating.

382
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:51,700
I mean, I love her, but,
you know,

383
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:52,735
you spend so much time and
effort on someone's life

384
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,009
and she's just gonna quit on me?

385
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:56,038
It's like, what's the point,
you know?

386
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,471
Wow, Leslie. I haven't
seen you this upset

387
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,773
since you almost forgot
Ann's half-birthday.

388
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:02,408
- Yeah.
- Tell me.

389
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:03,409
How many times have
we had lunch?

390
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:06,079
Five.
Well, eight, if you count

391
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:07,914
all those times I showed up
unannounced at your office

392
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,048
with mini-muffins.

393
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,984
And why have we had lunch
so many times?

394
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:14,020
Well, because, when I knew I
would be coming to Washington

395
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:17,357
to work, I wore you down until
you agreed to become my friend.

396
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:18,992
I'm so glad that you did.

397
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,628
And you are wonderful friend,
but, sometimes

398
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:23,696
you're so focused and driven

399
00:14:23,731 --> 00:14:25,131
that you forget about
people's feelings.

400
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:28,968
Ah, pfft! Name one time
I've done that.

401
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:30,570
Well, you were so wrapped up
in your story

402
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:33,373
that you actually ate my waffle.

403
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:35,441
Sometimes, all you can do

404
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:37,477
is give people
a little bit of advice

405
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:39,913
and a push,
but you have to realize

406
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:42,415
April has to be able to
make up her own mind.

407
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,651
Ah, you're right...

408
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,519
once again, Madeleine Albright.

409
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,321
Can I have my pin back now?

410
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:49,889
Oh! Oh, yeah, sorry.

411
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:51,324
Thank you for letting
me wear it.

412
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,659
Just makes me feel
very powerful.

413
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:53,993
Me too.

414
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,998
Resume's done. I used bullet
points instead of numbers

415
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:00,934
because I find it conveys
strength and confidence.

416
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,503
A binder of her accomplishments.

417
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,505
Photos of her
getting the job done.

418
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,473
And $500 cash,
in case you want to go

419
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:08,708
the straight-up bribe route.

420
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,976
Donna...

421
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,678
You put me on the team,
I find a way to win.

422
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:12,845
Okay, copies are made.

423
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,415
Um, everything has been
collated and stapled.

424
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,050
And all the research
has been double-checked.

425
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,718
I went through
quite a few staples.

426
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,454
I added a personal testimony
vouching for April's brilliance.

427
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:22,722
And this guy better
appreciate it because

428
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,325
I do not compare people to
Mary J. Blige lightly.

429
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,893
Uh, no one should.

430
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:27,927
Do you want to go
to dinner tonight?

431
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:29,128
- I do not.
- Respect.

432
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:30,930
- I'm free.
- I have plans.

433
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:32,398
Well, great job, guys.

434
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,634
With all this, Barney will at
least have to give her a shot.

435
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:37,203
Sure, they did a good job,
but this isn't enough.

436
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:39,672
And I've been thinking
about it all day

437
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,240
and I have a plan

438
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,742
to go the extra mile

439
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,445
and make April seem like
the ideal candidate.

440
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,453
Give me the job!

441
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:56,889
My name's April Ludgate and my
talent is explosive!

442
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,327
Go U-S-A!
U-S-A!

443
00:16:01,362 --> 00:16:03,896
U-S-A!
U-S-A!

444
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:06,566
U-S-A! When should I tell April
to show up?

445
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,834
My car...

446
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:14,841
Hey.

447
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,442
Thank you for coming.

448
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,144
Yeah, well, I had to miss

449
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,580
the memorable rain gutters of
Washington walking tour,

450
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:21,915
so, this better be good.

451
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:25,018
I'm sorry I blew up
at you yesterday.

452
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:27,654
I really want all of my friends
to be happy together,

453
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:31,791
but, more importantly,
I just want them to be happy.

454
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,395
If you feel like you need to
move on, I totally get it.

455
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,264
Okay.

456
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:39,899
- Turn around.
- What? Why?

457
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:41,768
Because I'm about to say
something serious

458
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:43,503
and I can't do it if I have to
look you in the eye.

459
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:45,038
- Please.
- Okay.

460
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,942
Now take your shoes off
and wear them like mittens.

461
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:52,245
- April...
- Okay, sorry.

462
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:59,085
When I started working for you,
I was aimless

463
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:02,655
and just thought everything
was stupid and lame,

464
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,425
and you turned me into someone

465
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,695
with goals and ambition,

466
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:11,664
which is really the only reason
why I'm even thinking about

467
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,766
what I really want.

468
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:20,607
I just...
wanna say thank you.

469
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:23,610
And I love you very much.

470
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:27,747
Which is why I have decided not
to turn you into a sea urchin,

471
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:30,817
which I could do,
because I am an actual witch

472
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:33,786
- with powers and I'm evil
- I know.

473
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:35,788
- and I hate everything.
- I know you do.

474
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:38,791
I know.
Thank you, April.

475
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:43,096
So you don't have any idea
what you want to do?

476
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,899
Well, here's the good news:
I am on the case.

477
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:49,102
I know some people who might be
able to help us. Come on.

478
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,871
April, this is Alyssa from the
American Service Foundation.

479
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,406
They take young people like you

480
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,208
who are trying to
explore a new path

481
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,276
and match them with one of
the thousands of jobs

482
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:59,279
across America
that help communities.

483
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:01,147
Alyssa, this is April Ludgate,

484
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,883
the single greatest
human being ever,

485
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,319
and you need to find her a job
that she will love and cherish

486
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,387
and make her life feel complete.

487
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:08,488
Okay. I'm sorry.

488
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:09,856
I found this crazy woman
on the street

489
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,391
and she won't leave me alone.

490
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,460
Oh, I'm very familiar
with Leslie's...enthusiasm.

491
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:16,062
They contacted us
last year because

492
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,097
they wanted to place some people
in national parks.

493
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:20,300
Two days later, we had
set up the entire program,

494
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,936
and she sent me a throw pillow
with my face stitched onto it.

495
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,104
Not my best work.
Plus, you changed your hair.

496
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:26,339
I'm gonna send you another one.

497
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:29,075
Okay, go solve all of
your career problems.

498
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,276
I'll wait right here.

499
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:31,444
Sorry.

500
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:34,121
- That-a girl!
- Ugh, Mom!

501
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:37,540
I don't know, Madeleine.

502
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:39,761
They're taking forever and
I'm starting to lose it.

503
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:40,848
Talk to me, okay?

504
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:41,982
Your voice makes me calm.

505
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:43,718
Tell me another Yeltsin story.

506
00:18:43,752 --> 00:18:45,214
Okay, she's here.
I have to go. Bye.

507
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,425
Say hi to your daughters.
Hey. Hi.

508
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:48,812
How did it go?

509
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:52,515
I'm great. I know exactly
what I want to do.

510
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,251
Yes!
Is it Teach for America?

511
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:56,786
No! Habitat for Humanity?

512
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,755
No! It's working
with animals.

513
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:02,459
No. I want to work here.
At the foundation.

514
00:19:02,493 --> 00:19:04,294
I want to be like Alyssa.

515
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:05,595
I wanna tell people what to do

516
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:07,831
and then send them
far away from me.

517
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:08,865
It's perfect.

518
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,333
And it hits everything
on my list.

519
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:12,535
Creative problem solving,
working one-on-one--

520
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,672
I am 100,000%
in support of this idea.

521
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,440
This is an amazing idea.
I love this idea!

522
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:18,675
And I love you!

523
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:19,843
So are they hiring?

524
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:21,478
What did Alyssa say
when you told her?

525
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:22,912
Um, nothing.
I didn't tell her yet.

526
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:26,349
I wanted to see if you thought
it was a good idea first.

527
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:27,384
What?

528
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:29,052
Bad idea?

529
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,654
You wanted to run
something by me?

530
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:31,655
Oh, my God.

531
00:19:31,689 --> 00:19:34,991
Yes. So, will you help me?

532
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:37,460
April, you don't need me.

533
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:38,895
You can get any job you want.

534
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,530
All by yourself.

535
00:19:40,564 --> 00:19:42,933
Well, obviously I'm going to
vet your resume

536
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:44,334
and we'll hold
some mock interviews

537
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:46,102
and I'll choose your outfit
and everything but--

538
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:49,673
you can get this sucker
on your own.

539
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:52,976
So, long story short, we might
have found you the perfect job

540
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,911
but also I might have blown it.

541
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:57,480
Ben and Ron are there now
to try to fix it.

542
00:19:57,515 --> 00:20:00,183
And if they don't, I feel like
it's kind of on them.

543
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:01,918
Everyone is being
so nice to me lately.

544
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,621
It's weird. I feel like I need
to take a shower in pig's blood

545
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:06,022
to wash all the niceness off me.

546
00:20:06,057 --> 00:20:07,190
It's because we love you.

547
00:20:07,224 --> 00:20:08,391
We want you to be happy.

548
00:20:08,426 --> 00:20:10,293
This consulting job could be
the answer.

549
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:12,829
Yeah, so about that...

550
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:17,583
Please don't hold anything Andy
did against April.

551
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:19,952
She is an exceptional human being,

552
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:22,107
who married a well meaning goof.

553
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,440
And I think that presentation
we put together says it all.

554
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,388
All we're asking is thatyou meet with her

555
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:30,095
and seriously consider her
for the job.

556
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:33,026
And if she disappoints you,
you can hold me...

557
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:35,317
accountable.

558
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,824
- Right?
- You know what?

559
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:40,044
If her friends are trying
this hard,

560
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:42,053
there must be something
amazing about her.

561
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:43,478
Tell her I'll meet with her tomorrow--

562
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:44,863
Uh, hold on. April?

563
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,075
Hey, we were just talking about you.

564
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:48,525
We got some good news.

565
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:52,409
Oh, boy.

566
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,096
Okay.

567
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:59,604
She doesn't want the job.

568
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:01,705
I see.

569
00:21:05,492 --> 00:21:07,959
Well, this is uncomfortable.
