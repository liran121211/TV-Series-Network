1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:04,892
Good morning, Ben.

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:06,930
Sorry.
Sorry.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,235
Did I scare you?
No.

4
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,799
I just wanted to remind you of the
art show that's happening tonight

5
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,242
at the community center.
Yeah. Yeah.

6
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,044
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,579
Great. Well,
that sounds cool.

8
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,947
That sounds like something that
will be a big success. You know?

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,319
I mean, like everything
that you put your paws on.

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,448
Your fingers.

11
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,622
Leslie Knope!
Ben Wyatt. Ben, great news.

12
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,417
Do you remember
the woman I told you about

13
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,052
from the county
commissioner's office?

14
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,324
Um... Vaguely.

15
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:33,625
Sure you do. Cindy Miller.

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,691
Anyway, she's agreed to go out
on a date with you.

17
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,895
Oh.

18
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,234
You asked her out for me?

19
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,103
You're going to love her.
She is interesting, smart and beautiful.

20
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,404
Inside and out.

21
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,968
Inner beauty is
very important.

22
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,638
And outer beauty is
also very important.

23
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,648
I thought you had a rule about
inter-government relationships.

24
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,746
Don't worry. Her department is
completely separate from ours.

25
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,087
This isn't anything like your
affair with Tom Haverford.

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,525
We weren't... You... You...

27
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,026
I'm sorry,
who are you calling?

28
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,085
<i>Cindy Miller.</i>

29
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,254
Cindy Miller. Chris Traeger.

30
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,194
Guess who is standing in
this room with me right now.

31
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,766
<i>Oh, uh...</i>
Ben Wyatt.

32
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,100
Ben, say hello.

33
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,035
Hi, Cindy. Sorry.

34
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:18,373
<i>Hi. No apology necessary.</i>
<i>It's just Chris being Chris.</i>

35
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:23,639
How are you doing?

36
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,841
Ooh! Sparks are flying!

37
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,086
We may have to call the fire department.
It's a government joke.

38
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,780
<i>I love setting people up.</i>

39
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,592
Here's my secret.
I determine someone's best qualities,

40
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:38,025
and then, I find someone else
with compatible qualities,

41
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,664
and I bring them together.

42
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,149
God, this sucks.

43
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,625
Why don't you just go home
for the rest of the day?

44
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,219
I can't go home,
because I have this

45
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,887
art show opening at
the community center,

46
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,058
and I can't stay
here because I see Ben,

47
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,932
and I can't date Ben because
of Chris<i>'</i> stupid rules.

48
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,936
I feel so...

49
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,704
Powerless.
Yeah.

50
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,204
I'm like that light bulb.

51
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,336
Weak, flickering,
barely giving off any light,

52
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:30,074
unable to make out with the light
bulb I want to make out with.

53
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,783
You know what might
make you feel better?

54
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,210
A hug?

55
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,146
Paxil. Do you want me
to get you a prescription?

56
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,456
Hey, Tom! A question for you.

57
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,427
Do you know anyone
who's looking for a roommate?

58
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:43,819
How hot?

59
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:44,987
I... What?

60
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,766
How hot is the woman that's
looking for a place to stay?

61
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,802
No, it's me. I'm looking.
Come on. That's not fair.

62
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,928
You shouldn't have led me to
believe it was a beautiful woman.

63
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,267
I didn't.

64
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,567
I've been staying at the Pawnee
Super Suites Motel for seven months.

65
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,612
It's a charming little inn with
wonderfully random wake-up calls,

66
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,079
delightfully
unstable temperatures,

67
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,778
and, as of yesterday, bedbugs.

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,850
"Four stars," says nobody.

69
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,221
I wish I could help you, Benihana,
but I can't. I have a one-bedroom.

70
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,916
I can't have a dude
sleeping on my couch

71
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,585
if and when I
bring home a lady.

72
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,527
I have a ritual,
and it starts on the couch.

73
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,860
We sit down,
clap my hands, lights dim.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,729
Okay. I understand.

75
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,666
Boyz II Men. Fades in.
Please, stop. No.

76
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,602
No, you don't need to
explain the ritual. I'm good.

77
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,139
You know who might
be able to help out

78
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,674
a homeless dude
such as yourself?

79
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,635
This is awesomely perfect.

80
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,475
Burly just moved in
with his rich girlfriend,

81
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,411
and we need
help with the rent.

82
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,915
We have a couple of
house rules, though.

83
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,178
Yeah, sure. Of course.

84
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,412
You can't use the front door.

85
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,885
You have to climb in
through the back window.

86
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,684
No personal
phone conversations.

87
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,282
If you ever speak to me in Spanish,
please use the formal <i>"usted".</i>

88
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,624
And no
electricity after 6:00 p.m.

89
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,625
She's joking.
Okay.

90
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,166
You can use as much
free electricity as you want.

91
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,927
It's free.
Couple more rules.

92
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,998
If you ever watch a sad movie,

93
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,536
you have to wear
mascara so we can see

94
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,071
whether or not
you've been crying.

95
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,576
There's no noise allowed on Mondays,
and no TV after breakfast.

96
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,034
She is lying again.

97
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,102
She is.

98
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,341
Yes.
Because it's hard to tell.

99
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,110
No. We leave
the TV on all day long

100
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,845
so burglars think that
we're home when we're not,

101
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,410
which was my idea that
I'm trying to patent.

102
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,653
So, you want to
move in tonight?

103
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,129
Yeah. Sure.
That would be great.

104
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,391
You want my gum?
Uh-huh.

105
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,237
Ron, can you make
the opening remarks?

106
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,841
I'm just...
I'm not in the mood.

107
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,838
Neither am I. Ever.

108
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,172
What's wrong with you?
You live for this kind of stuff.

109
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,711
I don't have it
in me right now.

110
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,273
Ron, please. Do it for me.
Make the speech. Ron, please. Please.

111
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,850
Give the speech, Ron.
No.

112
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,784
Yes. Please? Ron? Please.
No.

113
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,515
Please give the speech.
Please give the speech.

114
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,920
No. I won't. Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

115
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,515
No way.
Please, please, please, please, please.

116
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,651
No. Please, please.
Yes, yes...

117
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,752
All right! Damn it, woman.

118
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:01,829
Okay, everyone.
Shut up and look at me!

119
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,661
Welcome to
"Visions of Nature."

120
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,931
This room has
several paintings in it.

121
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:11,340
Some are big. Some are small.
People did them, and they are here now.

122
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,844
I believe that
after this is over,

123
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,412
they'll be hung in
government buildings.

124
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,280
Why the government is involved
in an art show is beyond me.

125
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:22,344
I also think it's pointless for
a human to paint scenes of nature

126
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,788
when they can just go outside
and stand in it.

127
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:28,588
Anyway, please do not misinterpret
the fact that I am talking right now

128
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:33,428
as genuine interest in art and
attempt to discuss it with me further.

129
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,932
End of speech.

130
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,530
And that's the TV room.

131
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,902
Oh, my God.

132
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,904
Yeah, it's a mess.

133
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,948
Can you throw that
in the trash can?

134
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,782
I was just here, like,
three weeks ago for your wedding.

135
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,980
What happened?

136
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,282
Well, Burly moved out.

137
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,292
He was the one that did all the
cleaning and throwing away and stuff.

138
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,950
Wait, he moved out,
like, a week ago.

139
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,585
You guys made
this mess in a week?

140
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,561
Well, I always think
April's going to clean up.

141
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,292
And I never clean up.

142
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,391
It's cute, right?

143
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,657
No.

144
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,760
Yes, it is.

145
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,703
Are you guys frying marbles?

146
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,736
We were checking to see
if the fire alarm worked.

147
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,834
It doesn't.

148
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:23,678
<i>The biggest challenge to
picking the perfect roommate is</i>

149
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,510
finding someone
who's willing to pay more

150
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,280
than their share of
rent without knowing it.

151
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,786
I think we found that in Ben.

152
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,462
You forgot to
paint a painting, son.

153
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,232
So, for my painting,
I chose one

154
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,267
of my very
favorite Greek myths,

155
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,198
the centaur goddess, Dyaphena,
slaying a great stag.

156
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,531
It's stunning.

157
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,800
It's breathtaking, Jerry.

158
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,001
Yeah. It really is.

159
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,872
Wow. Thanks, guys.

160
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,971
Hey, Leslie,
you should really come

161
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,140
over here and look
at Jerry's painting.

162
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,411
Oh, my God.

163
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,519
That's me.
Is that me?

164
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,758
What? No.

165
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,793
Geez, it does
look like you.

166
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,294
You're just
realizing that now?

167
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,628
That's what you see when you
close your eyes at night, Jerry.

168
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,166
Topless Leslie
glued to a horse.

169
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,929
Okay. Leslie,
I am just so, so sorry.

170
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,737
Dyaphena,
she is this powerful goddess,

171
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,867
and I've been thinking a lot
about powerful women,

172
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,377
and subconsciously,
I painted you.

173
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,309
I'm sorry. I'm going
to take it right down.

174
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,279
No. Leave it up.

175
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,516
I love it.

176
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,476
I don't know
how to explain it.

177
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,989
Every time I look at it,
I just think to myself,

178
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,592
"What can't that
centaur woman do?

179
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,058
"Besides ride
an escalator and drive a car."

180
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:48,157
Art can be so magnificent.

181
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,033
Oh, my God.
The baby is Tom.

182
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,568
What?

183
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,672
This is easily my
favorite painting ever.

184
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,506
What the hell, Jerry? Look at my pot
belly. I look like a pregnant baby.

185
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,369
And why am I so scared? All right,
we've got to take this down. Now.

186
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,937
No, this painting
isn't going anywhere, Tom.

187
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:07,017
It's staying right here.
Hello, fellow lover of the arts.

188
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,081
Welcome to the painting.

189
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,613
What, is that you?

190
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,315
Well, it's hot.

191
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,220
Thank you.

192
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,457
This guy's in it, too.
He's the little fat baby.

193
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,187
Cool.

194
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,255
Yeah.

195
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,930
What's going on right here?

196
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,799
Baby rolls!

197
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,401
We've been trying to get
that light fixed for months.

198
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,534
Thank you.

199
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,840
Thank her.

200
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,209
Good morning, Tom.

201
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,079
She marched into my office this
morning and told me she wouldn't leave

202
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,516
until I got this done.

203
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,610
Hmm.

204
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,746
Well, I'm glad
someone's feeling good.

205
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,815
They're going to hang that
painting in a public building

206
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,257
where anybody can see it.

207
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,223
In one brush stroke,
Jerry has killed the Jay-Z vibe

208
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,663
that's taken me
years to cultivate

209
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,133
and replaced it with the fat,
brown baby vibe,

210
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,031
which is not as
cool of a vibe.

211
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,595
Hey, Aphrodite. Chris
needs you in his office.

212
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,662
Hmm.

213
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,133
When you're done with the light,
fix the printer.

214
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,574
I don't know how
to fix printers.

215
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,008
Learn it.

216
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,205
Leslie, should I go, too?

217
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,946
This isn't about you, Jerry.

218
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,143
It's my painting.

219
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,751
Why am I upset?

220
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:20,189
Let's start with
government-funded animal porn.

221
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,022
I'm not sure
that's fair.

222
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,756
I want it destroyed,
and I want a statement from this office

223
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,630
apologizing for an obscene
depiction of bestiality.

224
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,394
Bestiality? It is
a picture of a centaur,

225
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,696
a beautiful half person,
half horse.

226
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,365
And how did it
get like that?

227
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:39,342
Who had sex with what
and gave birth to which?

228
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,447
Ms. Langman, we hear you,
we understand you

229
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:46,314
and we are going to do whatever
we can to come to a solution.

230
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,917
Destroy it.

231
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,453
Destroy it?
I mean, is she serious?

232
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,889
Do you find this
personally offensive?

233
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,791
Not personally, no.

234
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,522
No, personally, I enjoy a good
artistic depiction of the human form.

235
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,997
I've dabbled in nude sculpture.
I've posed nude.

236
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,162
In college,
I was in a nude production of <i>Cats.</i>

237
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,295
But I am not in
the nude now, am I?

238
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,871
Because we're in
a government building.

239
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,909
And that would
be inappropriate,

240
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,011
which is what I
think Marcia is saying.

241
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,939
So, take care of
this situation.

242
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,515
<i>That painting is not</i>
<i>going to be destroyed.</i>

243
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,983
Every great work of
art contains a message.

244
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,350
And the message of
this painting is,

245
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:27,882
"Get out of my way unless you want
an arrow in your ass, Marcia."

246
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,919
Morning, roomie.
How did you sleep?

247
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,589
Well, there were
no bedbugs.

248
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,032
Also, no bed.
I'm going to go buy a bed.

249
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,732
Fork.
I'm sorry.

250
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,931
Are you eating turkey
chili off of a frisbee?

251
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,375
Yeah. It's
pretty cute, right?

252
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,378
No. Do you know
what "cute" means?

253
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,414
What have you got against
turkey chili for breakfast?

254
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,007
What have you guys got
against washing dishes?

255
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,052
We don't have
any dishes, okay?

256
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,849
Burly took them
all when he left.

257
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,751
Now, I bet you
feel like a jerk.

258
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,652
God. Okay, I might need to not
stay here anymore.

259
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,927
No. Sorry, dude. We already spent
your money on a new Xbox 360

260
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,361
and more
frisbees to eat off of.

261
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,728
You've got to stay.

262
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,197
God. Okay. All right.

263
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,561
Here's the deal.

264
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,203
We're going to
clean this place up.

265
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,600
Okay? And then, I am going to
teach you how to be adults.

266
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,605
Cool. We'll get to be adults.

267
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,070
Gee, golly.
Thanks, mister.

268
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,175
Fork.

269
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,416
Hello. I'm Perd Hapley,
and welcome to <i>Ya' Heard? With Perd.</i>

270
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,719
Today's show begins now.
Is this art

271
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,623
or is it pornography?

272
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,991
Here to answer this question

273
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,530
is Parks and Recreation Deputy Director,
Leslie Knope.

274
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,155
Perd, it is
a beautiful work of art.

275
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,360
Governments should not be
in the business of censorship,

276
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,163
especially when a painting is
as awesome as this one.

277
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,364
But this is
where the controversy

278
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,600
of this story gets
even more controversial.

279
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,178
You are the subject
of this painting.

280
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,576
Half woman,
half horse, with what

281
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,979
some would say
are human breasts.

282
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,914
I am not the subject.

283
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:04,489
The subject is strong and
empowered women everywhere.

284
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,655
But it does look
a little bit like me.

285
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,752
Leslie,
for our viewers at home

286
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,920
who might not know,
are centaurs real?

287
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,487
No.

288
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,699
Absolutely sure?

289
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,931
Okay. So, you always separate
your lights from your darks.

290
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,028
That's racist.

291
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,605
And then,
you get your laundry...

292
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,208
Where is your
laundry detergent?

293
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,004
Right. Here we are.

294
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:29,238
Okay. This is
bubble bath. You guys...

295
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,075
You wash your
clothes in bubble bath?

296
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,411
Bubble bath,
clothes soap, same thing.

297
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,919
No, it's not.

298
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,148
Well, they both
make bubbles, so...

299
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,153
It was never our
intention to offend anyone

300
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:45,220
I guess some people object to
powerful depictions of awesome ladies.

301
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,353
Okay.

302
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,398
Also joining us today
is a different person.

303
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,698
Pornographic film actress,
Brandi Maxxxx.

304
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,231
Pleasure to be here.
Brandi, you've starred in

305
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,537
over 200 adult films,
some of which are very good.

306
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,302
When did you get into the business?
Last year.

307
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:04,474
Fantastic. Now, this painting
right here, art or pornography?

308
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,811
Perd, I think this
whole debate is ridiculous.

309
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,216
What Leslie and I
do is obviously art.

310
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,386
Hang on.
There is a big difference

311
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,724
between an oil painting of a Greek
myth and a pornographic movie.

312
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,456
It's okay, Leslie.
I got this one. What?

313
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,557
What Leslie and I want people to know
is you should be able to have sex

314
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,034
anywhere you want
and show it anywhere you want.

315
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,069
Whether it's girl-on-girl
action, bondage, or...

316
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,470
Yep.
...what have you.

317
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:32,136
Okay. Hang on.
Pornography is very difficult to define.

318
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,802
In fact, it was Justice
Stewart who once said,

319
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,508
"I can't define pornography,
but I know it when I see it."

320
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,346
Brandi, how would
you define pornography?

321
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,510
For me, it's when
the penis goes in.

322
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,986
All right, we need to do
some basic organization.

323
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,888
Where do you put your
bills when they come?

324
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,599
I read the magazines
and give the rest to Andy.

325
00:13:55,801 --> 00:14:00,568
Which I organize into a pile or
stack that I put into the freezer.

326
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,466
Why?

327
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,768
So they won't get lost.

328
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,538
Bingo.

329
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,015
Okay, you have
to pay these.

330
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,049
Good thing
I didn't lose them.

331
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:19,750
Okay. New lesson.
Basic finance.

332
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,792
I'm gonna teach you
how to balance a checkbook.

333
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,289
Okay. I am going to teach you
how to open a bank account.

334
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,437
Bank account. Good.

335
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,396
Brandi, I'm Thomas Haverford.

336
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,701
I just wanted to
say I thought you made

337
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,103
some excellent
points up there.

338
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,003
I totally agree with
you that people should

339
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,805
be allowed to have
sex in public places.

340
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,946
You look familiar to me.

341
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,776
Maybe you've seen me
down at the Snakehole Lounge.

342
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,284
I'm a part-owner there.

343
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,852
That's you. In the painting.

344
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,988
You're the fat baby.

345
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,182
Aw!

346
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,748
That's so cute.

347
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,417
Oh. You're into that?

348
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:56,786
No.

349
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,452
Damn it, Jerry.

350
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,396
Imagine my horror.

351
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,401
I'm hanging upside down with
my gravity boots watching Perd.

352
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,769
I see you with your painting,
and I am startled and disappointed.

353
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,132
Well, I did not know that
Brandi was going to offer me

354
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,506
a role in her next film.

355
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,440
I urge you not
to take that role.

356
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,002
I am not going
to take the role.

357
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,138
That's good to hear,

358
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,616
because recently,
you've been a little unpredictable.

359
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,379
I'm sorry that I'm trying to
defend a beautiful work of art.

360
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,615
Thank you, Leslie.

361
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,917
Stand down, Jerry.
This isn't your fight.

362
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,686
You've left me no choice.

363
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,088
I have convened a meeting
of the Public Arts Commission,

364
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,925
and we will abide
by their decision.

365
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,765
Fine with me.

366
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,464
Public Arts Commission.
Filled with hippies

367
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,900
who love art and
sometimes weed.

368
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,870
Jackpot.

369
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:44,614
I would just like
to introduce myself.

370
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:45,912
My name is Chris Traeger,

371
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,966
and I am a big fan of art.

372
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:55,522
Council, I
am not opposed to pornography.

373
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,190
In fact, you could say
I'm definitely for it.

374
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:59,126
If I had my laptop with me
right now,

375
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:00,994
I would show you
a well-hidden folder

376
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:02,696
with gigabytes of proof.

377
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:08,518
However, this... thing...
is... disgusting...

378
00:16:08,586 --> 00:16:10,270
And wrong.

379
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:12,289
Please let the record
reflect that the fat baby

380
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:14,007
is referring to the painting.

381
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:18,011
Hey! I am not a fat baby.
I'm a small, slender man--

382
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,414
similar to actor Taye Diggs.

383
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:23,617
So let the record
reflect that--

384
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:25,335
that I look like Taye Diggs.

385
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,488
Members
of the Public Art Commission,

386
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:30,307
good afternoon,
and good art.

387
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:37,431
Every great society
has always supported

388
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:38,932
artistic expression.

389
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:40,434
- The Romans...
- Perverts.

390
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,369
- The Greeks...
- Gay perverts.

391
00:16:42,437 --> 00:16:43,820
To great societies
in Europe.

392
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:45,605
Europeans.

393
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:48,108
There are some members
of this Community

394
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:49,993
that would like to demonize
this painting.

395
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,194
And when they do,

396
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,614
they in fact demonize
art itself.

397
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:58,285
What is or isn't art is up to
every free-thinking American

398
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,505
to decide on their own.

399
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:05,125
Uh, yeah, it's in the bag.

400
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:07,177
We've decided
that the painting

401
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:08,845
should be destroyed.

402
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,363
- Yeah! Burn it!
- Whoo!

403
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:12,499
What?
Are you serious?

404
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,301
You're supposed to be in favor
of public art.

405
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:16,703
Yeah, well,
there are nipples in it,

406
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:19,439
so it just seems like we ought
to be safe and destroy it.

407
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:27,013
Okay. Here is a list
of errands

408
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:29,983
and things
that human adults need.

409
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:31,651
Also, I'm giving you
an advance

410
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:32,953
on next month's rent.

411
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,905
And I want you guys
to go to Bed Bath & Beyond

412
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:36,289
and buy everything
on that list.

413
00:17:36,357 --> 00:17:38,875
Or we could buy a Wii.

414
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,327
You can handle this.

415
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,496
I don't know, man.

416
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:43,830
Why don't you just do it?

417
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:47,217
No, I can't.
I-- I...Have a date.

418
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:49,386
Ooh, what's his name?

419
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,470
It's actually not--

420
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:52,889
uh, Chris set it up.
Never mind.

421
00:17:52,974 --> 00:17:55,258
The point is, stick to the
list, and you'll do great.

422
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:58,545
I have total faith in you.

423
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:01,681
There's, like, a 30% chance
they'll both die.

424
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:03,517
So how do you want
to do this?

425
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,318
Burn it publicly
or burn it privately,

426
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:06,786
and I put the footage
on my blog or...?

427
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:07,988
You've made
your point, okay?

428
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:10,423
Look, this painting
is very important to me.

429
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:12,359
It doesn't need to hang
in a government building.

430
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,412
Just let me take it home,
and I'll keep it there.

431
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:17,464
What do you say?

432
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:20,200
I say this painting
is going to burn--

433
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:23,904
first here, then in hell.

434
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:25,121
Do I need
to get this validated?

435
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:26,806
- I don't-- I don't know.
- No?

436
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:27,941
Okay, then, great.

437
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,543
I'm just gonna
pull my car around,

438
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,711
and you can load it
in the back.

439
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,947
No.

440
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:38,418
- Hey! Come back here!
- Make me, stag! I am Dyaphena!

441
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:40,954
This place is amazing.

442
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:43,106
Oh, my God, they have a
thing that makes sherbet.

443
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,391
We need five of those!

444
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,326
No, we need to stick
with what's on the list.

445
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:48,478
First things first,
oven mitts.

446
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:50,063
Where are the oven mitts?

447
00:18:50,114 --> 00:18:53,650
Oh, my God. They have
all the <i>As-Seen-On-TV</i> stuff!

448
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:56,436
- Nuh-uh.
- Shake weight, Iron Gym...

449
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:58,004
Miracle Hand Repair,
Big Top cookie,

450
00:18:58,072 --> 00:18:59,623
- Pillow Pet, Slap Chop.
- Honey.

451
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:03,660
- Oh, my God.
- Honey, honey, listen to me.

452
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,378
Get it all.

453
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:07,297
Grab everything
that we've seen it on TV

454
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:09,049
and put it in this cart
right now.

455
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,985
Iron gym--
I am gonna get so buff.

456
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:13,253
Oh, my God.
Marshmallow shooter.

457
00:19:13,304 --> 00:19:14,387
Marshmallow shooter!
Get two.

458
00:19:14,455 --> 00:19:15,655
Wait, what
about the Magic Bullet?

459
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:17,824
Yeah. I've seen that.

460
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:23,196
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

461
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:25,131
I was at a meeting
around the corner,

462
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:27,984
and some people wanted
to destroy this painting,

463
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:29,703
so I brought it here.

464
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,371
Where's Andy and April?

465
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,873
They're out shopping.

466
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:38,545
- What are you doing here?
- I moved into the spare room.

467
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:39,946
Really?

468
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:41,715
- Yeah.
- Huh.

469
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:45,869
Can I come in?
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Of course.

470
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:47,587
Why do they want
to destroy it?

471
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:51,291
Well, it's a painting of me
as a centaur.

472
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:53,093
- Okay.
- And it's a nude.

473
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,794
Oh.

474
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,930
Just basically, like,
the "chestal" region.

475
00:19:56,998 --> 00:19:58,798
- Uh-huh.
- Mostly.

476
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,433
You don't have to look at it
if you don't want to.

477
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:01,835
- No, no, no.
- It's very classy.

478
00:20:01,902 --> 00:20:03,687
Yeah, no, I'm sure it is.

479
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:06,056
Oh, man. It's Chris.
Got to take this.

480
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,474
- Okay.
- Hi, Chris.

481
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,876
Leslie Knope, you need
to bring that painting back.

482
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:10,944
What painting?

483
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:12,278
Leslie,
you have the painting,

484
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:13,613
and you need to bring it
back in.

485
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,014
I think I've been
pretty fair with you.

486
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:16,416
And I'm starting
to feel angry.

487
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:17,817
And I don't like
feeling angry.

488
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:19,018
My heart is racing.

489
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,887
It's going
literally 45 beats a minute.

490
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:22,188
I'm sorry.

491
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:23,823
If I could just explain
to you my point of view--

492
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,558
You will bring that painting
in tomorrow morning

493
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:26,960
and surrender it
to Marcia Langman.

494
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:29,963
And that's that.
Do you understand me, madam?

495
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:32,599
Yes.

496
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:38,099
- Hehe
- Manipedi--

497
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:44,029
What are we doing?

498
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,897
We didn't get a single thing
that Ben told us to.

499
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:48,166
Sure we did.
We got the Marshmallow shooter.

500
00:20:48,234 --> 00:20:50,836
That's-- I don't think
that's on the list.

501
00:20:50,903 --> 00:20:53,788
- But I want it.
- I want it too.

502
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:56,408
But I also kind of want
my own fork...

503
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:57,575
Just 'cause you eat
really slow,

504
00:20:57,627 --> 00:21:02,247
which is cute,
but also super annoying.

505
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:04,733
- Fine.
- What? What's wrong?

506
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,587
Nothing. It's just adults
are boring, and I hate them.

507
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:10,322
And I don't want to buy
all this stupid, boring,

508
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:12,090
adult stuff
and become boring adults.

509
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:13,608
Hey, listen to me.

510
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:15,426
Yes, we're gonna get
a dish rack,

511
00:21:15,478 --> 00:21:18,063
and shower curtains,
and a cutting board.

512
00:21:18,114 --> 00:21:19,464
But if you think
for one second

513
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:21,833
I'm not also gonna get
that marshmallow shooter

514
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:23,969
so that I can shoot you
in the face with marshmallows

515
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:25,136
when you're asleep,

516
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:30,909
then you're
the dumbest woman I know.

517
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:32,244
You're gonna make me cry.

518
00:21:33,746 --> 00:21:36,548
You're a levelheaded person.
What do I do here?

519
00:21:36,616 --> 00:21:38,116
Well, I don't know.

520
00:21:38,184 --> 00:21:39,951
I mean, it is one of the
basic rules of government

521
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:41,786
that you shouldn't offend
people.

522
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:43,989
Yeah.
I guess you're right.

523
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:49,294
I just-- I'm so annoyed
by all these rules lately.

524
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:51,596
- Me too.
- Ha ha.

525
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:53,648
Hey, Leslie.
What are you doing here?

526
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:57,602
Hey. Um, well,
I, um, I stole a painting.

527
00:21:57,653 --> 00:21:59,804
And, um, I was hoping you guys
would help me hide it.

528
00:21:59,872 --> 00:22:02,073
I like it.
It's very simple.

529
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:04,943
No, it's on the other side.

530
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:08,546
Oh, my God.
Is that you as a naked horse?

531
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:10,448
Does it look like me?
I don't even--

532
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:13,585
Leslie, I mean, not to be
inappropriate or anything,

533
00:22:13,653 --> 00:22:15,086
'cause you're my boss
and my friend,

534
00:22:15,154 --> 00:22:17,489
but I would totally hit that.

535
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:19,391
- So would I.
- You guys are sweet.

536
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,327
Okay. I should go
and hit the road with this.

537
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:24,262
And, um...
Okay.

538
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,031
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

539
00:22:26,098 --> 00:22:27,332
Bye, Leslie.

540
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:29,134
So how'd we do?

541
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:31,803
I don't know.
Does this answer your question?

542
00:22:39,178 --> 00:22:42,047
No.
Did you buy plates?

543
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:43,231
Oh, plates.

544
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:48,353
Leslie, what are you doing?

545
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:49,654
Say good-bye to Dyaphena.

546
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:52,523
I have to turn her over
to stupid Marcia Langman.

547
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:56,694
- Really? Oh.
- What?

548
00:22:56,746 --> 00:22:57,879
I mean, to be honest,

549
00:22:57,964 --> 00:22:59,331
that seems like the kind
of thing I would do.

550
00:22:59,382 --> 00:23:02,667
And I didn't think
you would give in.

551
00:23:02,718 --> 00:23:04,002
Come with me.

552
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:08,873
- Hey, man.
- Roomie!

553
00:23:08,924 --> 00:23:11,576
Dude, it's super fun
to eat cereal

554
00:23:11,644 --> 00:23:13,578
from a bowl with a spoon.

555
00:23:13,646 --> 00:23:15,213
- Thank you for that.
- No problem.

556
00:23:15,264 --> 00:23:16,481
Though, you know,
you're not supposed to

557
00:23:16,548 --> 00:23:18,116
bring your dishes
into work, right?

558
00:23:18,184 --> 00:23:20,018
Ha ha.
Good one.

559
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:21,269
I'm serious.

560
00:23:21,354 --> 00:23:23,588
What's going on
between you and Leslie?

561
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:25,090
I noticed a weird vibe
when we came in the room.

562
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:27,058
Nothing.
I mean, we're friends--

563
00:23:27,126 --> 00:23:31,863
just regular friendship...
develop-- development.

564
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:33,731
Come on, roomie,
you can tell me.

565
00:23:33,783 --> 00:23:34,933
I know there's something.

566
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:38,569
I bet you I can guess
what it is.

567
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:40,238
She stole money from you.

568
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:43,574
What?
No, no, Andy,

569
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:46,044
she did not.

570
00:23:46,112 --> 00:23:47,812
I think we like each other.

571
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,383
But Chris has
this very strict rule--

572
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:52,801
co-workers can't date.

573
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:55,420
So, you know,
it's not even an option.

574
00:23:55,471 --> 00:23:57,822
- Wow.
- Yeah.

575
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,125
Well, first of all, Leslie--
she's, like, the coolest ever.

576
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:01,593
You've chosen well.

577
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,111
And secondly, hey, man,
if it's gonna happen...

578
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:05,113
It's gonna happen.

579
00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:06,764
Look at me and April.

580
00:24:06,816 --> 00:24:09,300
If you're anything like us,

581
00:24:09,368 --> 00:24:13,204
three weeks from now,
you'll be married, my friend.

582
00:24:14,874 --> 00:24:17,175
I'm glad you finally came
to your senses.

583
00:24:17,243 --> 00:24:20,512
I know that's not an easy
journey for you to make.

584
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:24,783
Let's take a look at
it first, shall we?

585
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,751
Whoa! It looks amazing!

586
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:29,471
I had the artist paint
over the Original.

587
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:31,956
- Feel free to destroy it.
- No!

588
00:24:32,024 --> 00:24:33,058
But I think you'll find

589
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,160
no one could possibly
be offended,

590
00:24:35,227 --> 00:24:37,262
unless, of course,
they have a problem

591
00:24:37,313 --> 00:24:39,064
with centaurs having
modern haircuts.

592
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:43,268
There were many kinds
of Greek goddesses.

593
00:24:43,335 --> 00:24:46,571
Some were lovers.
Some were warriors.

594
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:49,841
And some were tricksters.

595
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,512
I am so glad
that this got resolved,

596
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,948
because I hate being angry.

597
00:24:57,016 --> 00:24:58,383
- Hmm.
- Ben!

598
00:24:58,451 --> 00:24:59,484
- Come in here.
- Okay.

599
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:01,669
How did your date
with Cindy go?

600
00:25:01,754 --> 00:25:04,155
Uh, you know,
she wasn't really my type.

601
00:25:04,223 --> 00:25:06,674
She's a tall brunette.
You always like tall brunettes.

602
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:08,860
Well, not exclusively.

603
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:10,228
Historically, yes,
exclusively.

604
00:25:10,296 --> 00:25:11,880
He said he didn't like her,
so it's over.

605
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:14,682
Okay, well,
I'm gonna keep trying,

606
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:17,719
- because you are incredible.
- Thank you.

607
00:25:17,803 --> 00:25:19,971
And you deserve
someone amazing

608
00:25:20,022 --> 00:25:23,508
and smart and beautiful.

609
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:26,528
- Thank you.
- A real goddess.

610
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:29,380
- Exactly.
- Mm.

611
00:25:29,448 --> 00:25:32,817
Hey! What about Shelly,
from the health-food store?

612
00:25:32,885 --> 00:25:33,952
I don't know who that is.

613
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:35,019
Her brother died
climbing Everest?

614
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,020
Great.

615
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:37,021
- Interesting, right?
- No.

616
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:39,023
Nice job, Jerry.

617
00:25:39,074 --> 00:25:40,708
You look
like Enrique Iglesias.

618
00:25:40,793 --> 00:25:43,161
- Just wish I had more time.
- Why?

619
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:44,662
This is amazing.

620
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,715
It looks like me,
and I look awesome.

621
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,534
Is your penis
between the front arms

622
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:51,336
or the back legs?

623
00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:54,506
- Yeah, where's your penis?
- Damn it, Jerry!

624
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:59,476
Gail... I know Jerry
is your husband.

625
00:25:59,544 --> 00:26:02,262
Look, I can promise you
there's absolutely nothing

626
00:26:02,347 --> 00:26:03,680
going on between us.

627
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:07,184
No, no, I did not pose
for that painting.

628
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:08,485
But thank you
for thinking I did.

629
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:11,605
Okay, well... sure.
Hold on.

630
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:14,792
Gail, sweetheart, you have
nothing to worry about.

631
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:16,093
Okay?

632
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:18,829
I'm not gay,
neither is Jerry,

633
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:19,997
and I didn't pose for him.

634
00:26:20,064 --> 00:26:23,731
I promise you, hon,
Jerry only has eyes for you.

635
00:26:24,764 --> 00:26:26,231
And poundcake...
Am I right?
