1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:03,137
- THERE IS A CRAZY FLU
GOING AROUND--

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:05,273
LOTS OF MISERABLE
DEHYDRATED PEOPLE

3
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:08,376
WITH HIGH FEVERS
AND DIARRHEA.

4
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,710
AND ONE OF THOSE

5
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:12,713
DEHYDRATED, HIGH-FEVERED
MISERABLE PEOPLE

6
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,215
IS APRIL...

7
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:15,283
WHO HATES ME.

8
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:18,386
[device beeping]

9
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,654
- I WANT ANOTHER NURSE.
- WELL, THERE ARE NONE.

10
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,756
WE'RE STRETCHED PRETTY THIN
RIGHT NOW.

11
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,093
- THEN I WANT A JANITOR.
THEY CAN DO WHAT YOU DO, RIGHT?

12
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:28,262
- YEP, NURSES AND JANITORS
ARE TOTALLY INTERCHANGEABLE.

13
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:29,830
- EXCEPT NO ONE DRESSES UP
LIKE A JANITOR

14
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,632
WHEN THEY WANT
TO BE SLUTTY.

15
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,601
- I GET THE SENSE THAT MAYBE
YOU'RE ANGRY AT ME

16
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:34,835
FOR KISSING ANDY...

17
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,437
- NO, I'M NOT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,638
THAT'S CRAZY.

19
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,807
- AND THAT YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE
FUN TO TAKE IT OUT ON ME.

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,575
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

21
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,078
- "DO"?
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

22
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:47,148
I'M SICK.

23
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:49,783
[device beeping]

24
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,386
MY BLANKETS ARE
ON THE FLOOR.

25
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,854
[device beeping]

26
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,857
[triumphant music]

27
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:05,166
*

28
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:15,509
- SO, JJ, WE WANTED

29
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,545
TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

30
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,813
- YEAH, I HEARD YOU WERE
BRINGING THAT BACK.

31
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:20,681
- [coughing]

32
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,883
- SORRY, I HAVEN'T BEEN
FEELING MYSELF.

33
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,951
[clears throat]

34
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,787
WELL, I'M ORGANIZING
THIS HUGE HARVEST FESTIVAL,

35
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,857
AND I NEED
AT LEAST 80 LOCAL BUSINESSES

36
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,392
TO PARTICIPATE.

37
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,826
AND NORMALLY, THIS IS
THE KIND OF THING

38
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,295
I WOULD LOVE TO DO,

39
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,231
BUT I'M JUST FEELING
REALLY TIRED.

40
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:40,568
I THINK MAYBE MY ALLERGIES
ARE ACTING UP.

41
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:45,439
I'VE ALREADY VOMITED,
LIKE, FIVE TIMES TODAY.

42
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,475
WE'RE HAVING A MEETING TONIGHT
AT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,

43
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:48,909
AND WE'RE GONNA GO OVER
ALL THE DETAILS,

44
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,179
AND WE'D JUST LOVE IF YOU
COULD COME AND JOIN US.

45
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:54,382
- SURE, ANYTHING
FOR MY FAVORITE CUSTOMER.

46
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,384
- [chuckles] I BET YOU SAY THAT
TO ALL THE GIRLS.

47
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:58,686
- OH, NO, NO.
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE MY FAVORITE.

48
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,458
YOU SPENT OVER $1,000 LAST YEAR
ON WAFFLES ALONE.

49
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,227
- [coughing]

50
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,328
- HERE.

51
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,929
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
TO BRING YOU,

52
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,200
SO I JUST GOT
SOME MAGAZINES AND LIPSTICK--

53
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,334
WOMAN STUFF.

54
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,735
- THANKS.

55
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,938
ALL MY PARENTS GOT ME
WAS THAT.

56
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,473
- OKAY, WELL,
I'M NOT VERY GOOD

57
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,442
AT VISITING PEOPLE
IN HOSPITALS,

58
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,577
SO I'M GOING TO GO.

59
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:27,281
- HEY, IF YOU SEE ANDY,
WILL YOU NOT TELL HIM I'M HERE?

60
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:28,882
- OKAY.
- BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED,

61
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,451
I DON'T WANT HIM TO THINK--
- STOP.

62
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,620
DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

63
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,822
THE LESS I KNOW
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS,

64
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,190
THE HAPPIER I AM.

65
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:39,260
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN CARING ABOUT PEOPLE.

66
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,529
I ONCE WORKED
WITH A GUY FOR THREE YEARS

67
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,531
AND NEVER LEARNED HIS NAME--

68
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:46,234
BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD.

69
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,470
WE STILL NEVER TALK
SOMETIMES.

70
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,507
- MMM.

71
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,477
SO WE'VE DEVELOPED
A REVENUE-SHARING FORMULA

72
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,912
THAT WILL HOPEFULLY APPEAL
TO MOST BUSINESS OWNERS.

73
00:02:58,946 --> 00:02:59,947
- LESLIE!

74
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,949
GO HOME.
YOU'RE SICK.

75
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,884
- I'M NOT SICK.
IT'S JUST ALLERGIES.

76
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,354
COME ON, GUYS.
JUST LET ME IN THERE.

77
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:07,688
- NO.
- YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE.

78
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,756
- YOU'RE NOT COMING IN.

79
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,958
- LESLIE, YOU LOOK TIRED,
AND YOU'RE ALL SWEATY.

80
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,726
- YOU LOOK TIRED, AND YOU'RE
ALL SWEATY ALL THE TIME.

81
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,462
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?
YOU WANT TO GO THERE, JERRY?

82
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,297
- NO.
- FINE, I'M COMING IN.

83
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,466
- DONNA, BARRICADE
THE DOOR, NOW!

84
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:21,369
- DONNA, COME ON,
JUST LET ME IN.

85
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,636
- UN-UH.

86
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,805
- EITHER GO HOME,
OR GO BACK INTO QUARANTINE.

87
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,507
- I'M NOT GOING HOME.

88
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,342
- GET OUT OF HERE, LESLIE.
GO HOME.

89
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,843
- HIT THE BRICKS.

90
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,015
- OH, COME ON.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

91
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,650
SHE'S GERMING UP
ALL MY STUFF.

92
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,253
AW, YUCK.
LESLIE!

93
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,557
- ANN PERKINS.
- HEY.

94
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:44,758
HOW WAS YOUR RUN?

95
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,494
- ENDED
WITH A 5 1/2-MINUTE MILE,

96
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:47,695
MY PERSONAL LOW.

97
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,897
I THINK THE PAVEMENT
IN THIS TOWN IS SOFT.

98
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,566
- WHAT'S WITH THE MASK?
- FLU PREVENTION.

99
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,868
MY BODY IS FINELY TUNED,
LIKE A MICROCHIP.

100
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,604
AND THE FLU IS LIKE
A GRAIN OF SAND.

101
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,872
IT COULD LITERALLY SHUT DOWN
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.

102
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,041
- MY BODY'S LIKE A CHIP TOO.

103
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,477
POTATO CHIP.
[both chuckle]

104
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:04,612
NO.

105
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:05,546
- SPEAKING OF POTATO CHIPS,

106
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,748
YOU AND I ARE ON
FOR DINNER TOMORROW, YES?

107
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:08,916
- YES, DEFINITELY.

108
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,919
I'M SUPER, SUPER EXCITED.

109
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:12,920
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

110
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,955
- EXCELLENT.

111
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:18,859
WAY TO GO, BUDDY.
WAY TO GO.

112
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,694
- WE'VE BEEN ON A COUPLE
OF DATES.

113
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:21,962
I REALLY LIKE HIM.

114
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:26,066
THE PROBLEM IS,
HE'S LIKE A PERFECT HUMAN MAN.

115
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,902
I CAN'T FIND ONE FLAW.

116
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:32,072
THERE WAS ONE TIME
I THOUGHT HE FARTED.

117
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,442
BUT IT WAS ME.

118
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,843
[telephone ringing]

119
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,813
- I NEED TO FIND SOMEONE
TO FILL IN FOR APRIL.

120
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:42,316
NOW, I KNOW I'M NOT
GONNA FIND SOMEONE

121
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,886
WHO'S BOTH AGGRESSIVELY MEAN
AND APATHETIC.

122
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,323
APRIL REALLY IS
THE WHOLE PACKAGE.

123
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,091
BUT I THINK
I MIGHT KNOW SOMEONE

124
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,827
WHO WILL BE
JUST AS INEFFECTIVE.

125
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,431
[soft country music playing]

126
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,933
HELLO, ANDREW.
WHAT'S NEW?

127
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,069
- UM, A WHOLE LOT.

128
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,037
CHECK THIS OUT.
I JUST INVENTED IT--

129
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,473
SUPER STRAW.

130
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:08,976
*

131
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,744
AHH.

132
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,981
- SO JUST SIT HERE
AND DO YOUR THING.

133
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,616
- DO I HAVE TO TUCK
MY SHIRT IN?

134
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,518
BECAUSE, HONESTLY,
THAT'S KIND OF A DEAL BREAKER.

135
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:18,719
- LET 'ER FLY.

136
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:19,887
- HEY, WAIT.

137
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,489
WHERE'S APRIL?

138
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:22,856
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

139
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,494
- YEAH. I JUST GAVE HER
THE DAY OFF.

140
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,397
- WOULD IT BE WEIRD
IF I ASKED FOR THE DAY OFF?

141
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,865
YEAH, NO. IT'S OKAY.
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

142
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,667
- I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU LEAVING?

143
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,135
I THOUGHT WE HAD A MEETING.
- NO, WE DO.

144
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,371
IT'S JUST I THINK
IT'S A LITTLE CHILLY IN HERE.

145
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:38,806
- ARE YOU OKAY?
YOUR EYES ARE GLASSY.

146
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,640
- OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY--

147
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,675
IS SHE--IS SHE SICK?
ARE YOU SICK?

148
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:44,778
- NO.
- YEAH, SHE'S SICK.

149
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,414
THAT'S WHY I'M WEARING THIS

150
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,682
AND MISTING MYSELF
WITH HAND SANITIZER.

151
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,418
- I AM NOT SICK.

152
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:51,985
I JUST HAVE ALLERGIES, OKAY?

153
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,521
I TOOK A CLARITIN,
AND I THREW THAT UP.

154
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,022
SO I TOOK ANOTHER ONE.
I THREW THAT UP.

155
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,024
AND THEN I TOOK A THIRD,
AND IT STAYED DOWN.

156
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,091
I'M GETTING BETTER.

157
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,727
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE BURNING UP.

158
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,495
- YOU'RE BURNING UP.
WHAT?

159
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,696
- I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

160
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,598
I HAVE 2.8% BODY FAT.

161
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,966
MY BODY'S LIKE A MICROCHIP.

162
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,602
A GRAIN OF SAND
COULD DESTROY IT.

163
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:11,705
MY BODY'S A MICROCHIP.

164
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:12,740
- LESLIE, GO HOME.

165
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:13,807
- NO, I CAN'T.
I CAN'T GO HOME.

166
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,776
I HAVE TO GET READY
FOR THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS.

167
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,044
- COMMERCE.

168
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,746
- IF THIS MEETING
DOES NOT GO PERFECTLY,

169
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,748
THEN THE HARVEST FESTIVAL'S
GONNA BE OVER BEFORE IT BEGAN.

170
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,815
I CANNOT GO HOME.

171
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,453
- OKAY, THEN WHO IS YOUR DOCTOR?
- ANN'S MY DOCTOR.

172
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,721
AND SHE'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
NURSE IN THE WORLD.

173
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,557
- COME ON.
- OH, GOD.

174
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,891
NOW I'M HOT.
NOW IT'S REALLY HOT IN HERE.

175
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,726
- OKAY, WELL,
THAT'S YOUR FEVER.

176
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,195
- LESLIE, I TYPED YOUR SYMPTOMS
INTO THE THING UP HERE,

177
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,932
AND IT SAYS YOU COULD HAVE
NETWORK CONNECTIVITY PROBLEMS.

178
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,602
- 104.1.

179
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,871
LESLIE, YOU'RE DEHYDRATED.
I'M ADMITTING YOU.

180
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,906
- IF I WAS SICK,
COULD I DO THIS?

181
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,979
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- CARTWHEELS.

182
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,113
AM I NOT DOING THEM?

183
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,082
- NO.
- LOOK, DON'T WORRY.

184
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,084
I'VE DONE PRESENTATIONS
LIKE THIS BEFORE,

185
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,552
AND TOM WILL BE
WITH ME.

186
00:06:58,586 --> 00:06:59,887
SO YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

187
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,923
- IT'S NOT
THAT I DON'T TRUST BEN.

188
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,460
IT'S THAT I DON'T HAVE
FAITH IN BEN.

189
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:09,997
AND ALSO, I'M STARTING
TO FORGET WHO BEN IS.

190
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,134
- I'LL HANDLE THE GENERAL
OUTLINE, IF YOU WANT TO...

191
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,703
- LOOK.
- JUST JUMP RIGHT IN.

192
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:16,904
- THE WORST THING
YOU CAN DO

193
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,006
WITH AN IMPORTANT PRESENTATION
LIKE THIS IS OVER-PREPARE.

194
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,608
- WELL--
- SO...

195
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,576
I THINK IT'S BEST
IF I GO TO THE SPA.

196
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,046
- NO, WE PROMISED LESLIE
WE'D PREP FOR THE MEETING.

197
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,581
- NO, BEN,
YOU PROMISED LESLIE.

198
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,683
SEE, I NEVER PROMISE
LESLIE ANYTHING.

199
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:31,652
THAT WAY,
I NEVER DISAPPOINT HER.

200
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:32,620
I TRY TO BE CONSIDERATE.

201
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,955
WELL...

202
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,626
I AM OFF FOR A SOAK
AND A SCHVITZ.

203
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,662
"ARRIVEDERCH."

204
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,500
[telephone rings]

205
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:49,770
- RON SWANSON'S OFFICE.

206
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,871
YES.

207
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,973
I WILL TRANSFER YOU.

208
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,511
[dial tone]

209
00:07:57,545 --> 00:08:00,981
I JUST DROPPED
ANOTHER CALL.

210
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:05,519
[device beeping]

211
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:08,288
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
A FRESH SET OF PILLOWS.

212
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,723
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO SMOTHER ME?

213
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,992
HELP!
THE SLUTTY NURSE IS TRYING

214
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,961
TO SMOTHER ME TO DEATH
WITH A PILLOW!

215
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,162
- OKAY, NEVER MIND.

216
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,064
- STAY BACK, SLUT.

217
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,066
- I KNOW WHAT SHE'S
TRYING TO DO.

218
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,668
SHE'S TRYING TO GET ME
TO BREAK.

219
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,670
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

220
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:23,737
I'M GONNA BE PROFESSIONAL,

221
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,573
AND I'M GONNA PUT ON
A HAPPY FACE,

222
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,140
AND THEN I'M GONNA
GO INTO A SUPPLY CLOSET

223
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,543
AND SNAP A BUNCH
OF TONGUE DEPRESSORS.

224
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:32,546
- OKAY, SO LET'S, UM,
TALK ABOUT YOUR OPENING REMARKS.

225
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,081
DO YOU WANT ME
TO WRITE YOU A RAP?

226
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,549
I'LL WRITE YOU A RAP.
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

227
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,917
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE
TO PULL IT OFF.

228
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,051
YOU'RE TOO WHITE.

229
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,119
HOW ABOUT A SHOW TUNE
OR SOMETHING?

230
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:42,656
- I WAS JUST, UH, PLANNING
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF...

231
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,724
NON-MUSICALLY,

232
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,026
AND THEN GET EVERYONE
TO REFER TO THEIR PACKETS,

233
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,995
AND, UH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

234
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,063
- NO.
NO "BLAH, BLAH, BLAH," OKAY?

235
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:52,232
YOU NEED TO GO OVER
EVERY SINGLE DETAIL WITH ME.

236
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,902
- LESLIE, I PROMISE YOU,
I WON'T HALF-ASS THIS, OKAY?

237
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,069
NOW GET SOME REST.

238
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,572
- I HAVE SOME GREAT NEWS.
I THINK MY FEVER JUST BROKE.

239
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,307
- GOOD-BYE.

240
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,748
- THIS CAME OUT.

241
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:08,949
- EH.

242
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,250
I AM STARVING.

243
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,852
I HAVEN'T HAD LUNCH
SINCE YESTERDAY.

244
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,621
SO I'M GONNA HEAD OVER
TO CALLAHAN'S.

245
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:14,722
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T GO THERE.

246
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,256
THEY TOTALLY SKIMP
ON PICKLES.

247
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,058
LET ME GO
TO BIGHEAD JOE'S FOR YOU.

248
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,327
THEY HAVE
THE MOST INSANE BURRITOS.

249
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,663
- I DON'T MUCH GO
FOR ETHNIC FOOD.

250
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,697
- NO, NO, NO.
TRUST ME.

251
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,699
THEY HAVE ONE THAT'S CALLED
THE MEAT TORNADO.

252
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,968
LITERALLY KILLED A GUY
LAST YEAR.

253
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,638
- YOU HAD ME
AT "MEAT TORNADO."

254
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,342
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

255
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,044
- HEY, THAT FLU MEDICINE
REALLY HELPED.

256
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,746
I FEEL
A THOUSAND PERCENT BETTER.

257
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,180
GOOD AS NEW.

258
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,182
DOES THIS SCARF LOOK OKAY?
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK STUFFY.

259
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,051
BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT
TO LOOK TOO SCHLUBBY.

260
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,986
- GET BACK IN THAT BED.
- SO NO TO THE SCARF?

261
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,756
- GET BACK IN THE BED.
- NO, I'M GOING TO THAT MEETING.

262
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,323
- EITHER YOU GET BACK
IN THE BED,

263
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:51,792
OR I WILL STRAP YOU DOWN.

264
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,594
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.
DON'T TEST ME.

265
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,399
[raucous laughter]

266
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,301
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

267
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,737
- NOW, WHAT SUPERPOWER
WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE?

268
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,406
WOULD YOU RATHER BE ABLE TO FLY
OR BE INVISIBLE?

269
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,908
ED, GO FIRST.

270
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,744
- UH, FLY, I GUESS.
- I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

271
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,345
YOU CAN ONLY FLY FIVE FEET
ABOVE THE GROUND.

272
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,314
[laughter]

273
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,084
I BRING A CERTAIN PANACHE
AND SPICE

274
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,952
TO THE SPA EXPERIENCE
FOR THESE GUYS.

275
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,388
BEFORE I JOINED, THEY WERE JUST
THREE OLD WHITE DUDES

276
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,423
QUIETLY BOILING
IN HOT WATER.

277
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,794
WOULD YOU RATHER LIVE
IN THE POCKET

278
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,429
OF A GIANT KANGAROO

279
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,033
OR HAVE A POCKET
ON YOUR OWN STOMACH

280
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,936
THAT HAS A TINY KANGAROO
IN IT ALL THE TIME?

281
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,337
PRESTON.

282
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,740
- TINY KANGAROO
IN MY STOMACH POCKET.

283
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,743
- FORGOT TO MENTION,
THE TINY KANGAROO IS A RACIST.

284
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,411
[laughter]

285
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,080
- HEY, ANN.

286
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,381
- WHAT HAPPENED?

287
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:51,084
I JUST SAW YOU A FEW HOURS AGO,
AND YOU WERE FINE.

288
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,120
NOT LIKE,
"DAMN, YOU'RE FINE,"

289
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,755
BUT FINE HEALTH-WISE.

290
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,357
- MY BODY HAS NO FAT
TO PROTECT ITSELF FROM DISEASE.

291
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,426
THINGS HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY.
LISTEN TO ME.

292
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,995
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT YOU REPLENISH MY BODY

293
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,330
WITH ELECTROLYTES

294
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,866
AFTER EVERY INVOLUNTARY LOSS
OF BODILY FLUIDS.

295
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,400
- OH, BOY.
- MY BODY TENDS TO LOSE

296
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,437
A LOT OF FLUIDS
WHEN IT'S SICK.

297
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,372
MY BRAIN IS ON FIRE.
I'M DYING.

298
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,342
- MM. WELL, YOU DEFINITELY
HAVE THE FLU.

299
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,778
- OH, MY GOD.

300
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,980
THE MICROCHIP
HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.

301
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,917
- PIERRE GARCON
WAS A SIXTH-ROUND PICK.

302
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,754
- COLLIE WAS
THE FOURTH ROUND.

303
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:29,322
- INDIANAPOLIS COLTS
KNOW HOW TO DRAFT SO WELL.

304
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,758
- THEY REALLY DO.

305
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,061
ANDY, THIS WAS DELICIOUS.

306
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:35,295
- IT'S AWESOME, HUH?

307
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:38,799
- IT'S A WHOLE NEW
MEAT DELIVERY SYSTEM.

308
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,133
THANK YOU, SON.

309
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,002
- WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO OUT TO THE PARKING LOT,

310
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,471
RUN A FEW PASS PLAYS
TO BURN OFF THE CALORIES?

311
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,474
- YOU ARE AN UNSTOPPABLE
GOOD-IDEA MACHINE!

312
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,742
[laughs]

313
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,210
I LIKE ANDY.

314
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,279
I'M SURROUNDED
BY A LOT OF WOMEN

315
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,114
IN THIS DEPARTMENT.

316
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,383
AND THAT INCLUDES THE MEN.

317
00:11:56,416 --> 00:12:00,387
HUP, HUP, HUP!

318
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,122
- PEYTON MANNING
READING THE DEFENSE!

319
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,390
REGGIE WAYNE, POST CORNER!

320
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:06,393
[car alarm blaring]

321
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,932
- [laughing wildly]

322
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,433
ANDY, WAIT UP!

323
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,036
[device beeping]

324
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,404
- HEY, APRIL.

325
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,407
I SAW THAT YOU CALLED FOR ME.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

326
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,510
- I NEED MORE FLU MEDICINE.
- OH, AN ACTUAL REQUEST.

327
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,445
WELL, YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY.

328
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,881
THAT STUFF IS POWERFUL--
NO EXTRA DOSES.

329
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,416
- I DIDN'T TAKE ANY.

330
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:32,385
LESLIE CAME IN HERE
AND STOLE IT AND LEFT.

331
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,422
- LESLIE?

332
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,292
LESLIE!

333
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,828
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN LESLIE?

334
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,395
- I HAD A DREAM

335
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,397
THAT SHE CAME
INTO THIS ROOM,

336
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:48,101
STOLE MY FLU MEDICINE,
TOLD ME NOT TO TELL YOU,

337
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,470
AND THEN DISAPPEARED
THROUGH THAT HOLE IN THE WALL.

338
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,205
- THE DOOR?

339
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,975
- MAYBE WE SHOULD GET
A SUITE HERE FOR THEM, OKAY?

340
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,877
- BEN WYATT!
HELLO!

341
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,311
- UH, HI, LESLIE.

342
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,813
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- YOU TOO.

343
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:02,182
WOW, YOU'RE REALLY
BURNING UP.

344
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,383
- CAN I GET SOME MONEY

345
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,218
FOR THE CAB THAT I TOOK
OVER HERE, PLEASE?

346
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,219
- SURE.
HOW MUCH?

347
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,220
- I'M NOT SURE.

348
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,388
I LOOKED AT THE METER,

349
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,858
AND IT HAD
EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHICS ON IT.

350
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:12,492
- WOW.
- DO YOU KNOW THE EXCHANGE RATE?

351
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,394
SO SHOULD WE DO THIS?

352
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,496
OH, BOY.
HOLD ON.

353
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,498
BE CAREFUL.
- WHAT?

354
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:22,002
- THE FLOOR AND THE WALL
JUST SWITCHED.

355
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,436
- OKAY.

356
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,472
- WALK VERY CAREFULLY.

357
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,615
- YOU KNOW, I FIND IT
A LITTLE INSULTING

358
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,217
THAT YOU DON'T TRUST ME
TO HANDLE THIS.

359
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,352
- IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T TRUST YOU, OKAY?

360
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:42,389
IT'S JUST--THIS HARVEST FESTIVAL
IS MY PROJECT.

361
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,324
IT'S MY CAREER ON THE LINE.

362
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,325
AND I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE

363
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:49,162
THAT I'VE DONE EVERYTHING I CAN
TO MAKE IT WORK.

364
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,998
[sighing]
OKAY.

365
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,299
IT'S SHOWTIME.

366
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,101
- OKAY.

367
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,269
- GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
I'M LESLIE MONSTER.

368
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,105
AND THIS IS NIGHTLINE.

369
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,272
- OKAY, I WOULDN'T OPEN
WITH THAT.

370
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,440
- NO?

371
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,275
- WHY DON'T WE SIT DOWN. OKAY?
- YEP.

372
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:06,346
- LIBERTARIANISM IS ALL
ABOUT INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY,

373
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,547
AND IT SHOULD NEVER BE DEFINED

374
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,150
BY THE TERMS "LIBERAL"
OR "CONSERVATIVE."

375
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,652
- AND COMMUNISM IS
NO GOOD, RIGHT?

376
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,653
- THAT'S RIGHT.

377
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,455
BIG SWING AND A MISS.

378
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,323
- AND WHAT'S THE WORD

379
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,326
FOR WHEN A FEW CLERICS ARE
IN CHARGE?

380
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,360
RELIGIOUS OLIGARCHY.

381
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,562
- HOLY [bleep].
[both laugh]

382
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,165
- I CAN REMEMBER THINGS.
- I GUESS.

383
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,500
- MM, HEY,
KEEP MINE RARE.

384
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,904
- A MAN AFTER MY OWN HEART.

385
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:35,508
- I VOMITED
SOMEWHERE IN THIS ROOM.

386
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,178
I DON'T REMEMBER WHERE, THOUGH.

387
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,915
WAIT. YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK
THAT DRAWER.

388
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,551
STOP...

389
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,219
POOPING.

390
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,388
- YOU HAVE TO GET UP
OFF THE FLOOR NOW.

391
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,389
- THIS FLOOR IS MY FRIEND.

392
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,325
- NOTHING LIKE A COMPLETE
PHYSICAL BREAKDOWN

393
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:55,128
TO MAKE A GUY SEEM
LESS INTIMIDATING.

394
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:56,563
I LOVE THE FLU.

395
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,265
- AND THEN I SAID,
"UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

396
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:02,469
I THINK WE NEED TO GET
THESE BANANAS OUT OF HERE."

397
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:03,971
HAVE A SEAT, BOYS.

398
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,939
- OH, HEY, TOM,
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

399
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:08,375
UH, YOU HAVE A NICE DAY
WITH YOUR SPA BUDDIES?

400
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,077
- ACTUALLY, YES, BEN,
I DID.

401
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,544
AND MY SPA BUDDIES OWN

402
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,380
A COUPLE OF CAR DEALERSHIPS
IN TOWN,

403
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,215
AND THEY'VE AGREED
TO DONATE

404
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,384
A FLEET OF VEHICLES
FOR HARVEST FESTIVAL--

405
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,453
25 VANS
FOR THE ENTIRE EVENT.

406
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,555
- OKAY, TOM, I'M READY.
GET UP THERE AND INTRODUCE ME.

407
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,124
- YOU GOT IT.

408
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,959
- I CAN'T LET YOU
DO THIS, LESLIE.

409
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,996
- HEY, THIS AIN'T
YOUR CALL, MCCLUSKEY.

410
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,399
- HEY, RON,
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

411
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,402
- SURE.
- IT'S ABOUT APRIL.

412
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,505
- I DON'T LIKE TO GET INVOLVED
IN PEOPLE'S PERSONAL--

413
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:42,009
- I HURT HER FEELINGS,
AND NOW SHE'S PISSED AT ME.

414
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,410
I FEEL LIKE
IF I COULD JUST EXPLAIN MYSELF,

415
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,413
SHE'D UNDERSTAND,
BUT SHE'S AVOIDING ME.

416
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,648
IT'S MAKING ME MISERABLE.

417
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,454
- APRIL'S IN THE HOSPITAL,
SICK WITH THE FLU.

418
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,288
- WHAT?

419
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,723
I KNEW IT!

420
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,158
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

421
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,093
IS SHE OKAY?
- YEAH, SHE'S FINE.

422
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,728
YOU CAN GO VISIT HER
TOMORROW MORNING.

423
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,296
BUT DON'T TELL HER
I TOLD YOU.

424
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,632
- I WON'T.

425
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,401
NO, NO.
NOPE.

426
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,402
COME HERE.
- UGH.

427
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,338
- OHHH!

428
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:14,574
- BEFORE WE GET STARTED,
A QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT--

429
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,477
EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT
IS LADIES' NIGHT

430
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,081
DOWN AT THE SNAKEHOLE LOUNGE
OVER ON BURNHAM AVENUE.

431
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,383
LADIES GET TWO DRINKS
FOR THE PRICE OF ONE.

432
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,152
OH, NO,
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

433
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,554
THAT'S WAY TOO GOOD
OF A DEAL.

434
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,456
NOPE.

435
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,324
THAT IS WHAT IT SAYS.

436
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,325
WOW.

437
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,793
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A FUN TIME.

438
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,029
ANYWAY, UH,

439
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:37,530
IT IS NOW MY GREAT HONOR
TO WELCOME TO THE STAGE

440
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:40,500
THE WOMAN RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE ENTIRE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

441
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,669
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
LESLIE KNOPE!

442
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:46,139
[applause]

443
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,184
- EVERY ONE OF YOU,

444
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,386
JUST BY SHOWING
UP HERE TONIGHT,

445
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:00,787
HAS ALREADY MADE HISTORY.

446
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,690
IN DAYS PAST,
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL

447
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,392
WAS THE CORNERSTONE

448
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,228
OF PAWNEE'S
SMALL-BUSINESS COMMUNITY--

449
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,629
A WEEKLONG SHOWCASE

450
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:13,166
FOR EVERYTHING FROM TEXTILES
TO SMALL FARMS.

451
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,402
BY OUR ESTIMATES,
AS MANY AS 30,000 PEOPLE

452
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,836
MIGHT ATTEND THE FESTIVAL,

453
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,405
AND THE MONETARY VALUE

454
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,740
OF THAT KIND OF DIRECT
CUSTOMER-TO-BUSINESS EXPOSURE

455
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,410
IS, FRANKLY, INCALCULABLE.

456
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,347
- WHAT?

457
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,082
- THREE, TWO, ONE.

458
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:30,350
AND MY SHIFT'S OVER.

459
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,319
WHAT THE [bleep]
IS YOUR PROBLEM?

460
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,187
- WHOA, I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T GONNA LOSE IT.

461
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,323
- WHILE I WAS ON DUTY, I DIDN'T.
NOW IT'S JUST ME.

462
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,558
I GET THAT YOU'RE MAD
THAT I KISSED ANDY, OKAY?

463
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,160
BUT IT WAS A MOMENT
OF CONFUSION,

464
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,394
AND IT WAS A MISTAKE.

465
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,096
AND I'M VERY SORRY.

466
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,297
YOU WANT TO HATE ME FOREVER?

467
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,765
- OKAY.
- FINE!

468
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,334
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE.

469
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,501
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE IT OUT
ON ANDY,

470
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:51,271
BECAUSE HE REALLY LIKES YOU,
AND HE DID NOTHING WRONG.

471
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:54,441
AND JUST FOR THE RECORD,
I'M STARTING TO HATE YOU TOO.

472
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,879
- THAT'S THE MOST
I'VE EVER LIKED ANN.

473
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,182
- THE TIME IS NOW.

474
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,317
THE PLACE IS PAWNEE.

475
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,419
LET'S MAKE HISTORY.

476
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,488
[cheers and applause]

477
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,124
- THAT WAS AMAZING.

478
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:12,559
THAT WAS A FLU-RIDDEN
MICHAEL JORDAN

479
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,761
AT THE '97 NBA FINALS.

480
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,396
THAT WAS...

481
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,398
KIRK GIBSON
HOBBLING UP TO THE PLATE

482
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,766
AND HITTING A HOMER
OFF OF DENNIS ECKERSLEY.

483
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,902
THAT WAS...

484
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,638
THAT WAS LESLIE KNOPE.

485
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,907
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ANY QUESTIONS?

486
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,642
YES, SIR?

487
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,312
- ARE WE GOING TO GET
THE SAME SALES-TAX INCENTIVES

488
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,446
WE USED TO?

489
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,348
- THAT'S A VERY GOOD
QUESTION, SIR,

490
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:38,418
AND I WOULD COUNTER
WITH MY OWN QUESTION, WHICH IS,

491
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,188
WHY IS HALF OF YOUR FACE
ALL SWIRLY?

492
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,522
- OKAY, UM, UNFORTUNATELY,

493
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,558
LESLIE HAS ANOTHER VERY
IMPORTANT MEETING RIGHT NOW.

494
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,260
SO IF YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS,

495
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,828
YOU CAN JUST DIRECT THEM,
UH, TOWARDS ME.

496
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:49,729
- GIVE IT UP, EVERYBODY,

497
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,798
FOR SCOTT BAKULA
FROM QUANTUM LEAP.

498
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,434
- ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, LET'S--

499
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,303
- EXCUSE ME.

500
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,705
- UM, AND TO ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION, SIR,

501
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,607
THERE WILL BE
SALES-TAX INCENTIVES THIS YEAR.

502
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,309
- I THINK I SHOULD DRIVE YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

503
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,776
- WAS I WEARING A TIARA
WHEN I CAME IN HERE?

504
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,312
BECAUSE IF YOU HAPPEN
UPON IT,

505
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,913
WILL YOU HAVE LADY PENNYFACE
RETRIEVE IT

506
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,315
AND SEND IT POSTHENCE?

507
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,449
- CHOCOLATE-COVERED POPCORN.

508
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,285
[knocking at door]

509
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,387
- OH, HEY.
- HEY, THERE.

510
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,423
I GOT YOU, UH,
SOME WAFFLES HERE,

511
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,491
COURTESY OF JJ'S DINER,

512
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,293
AND CHICKEN SOUP,
COURTESY OF ME.

513
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,229

- OKAY.

514
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,431
- THANK YOU.

515
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,299
SO HOW DID THE REST
OF THE MEETING GO?

516
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,236
- UM, WELL,
YOU SAID YOU NEEDED

517
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,670
80 TOTAL BUSINESSES
TO PARTICIPATE.

518
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,472
- YEAH.

519
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,406
- WE HAVE 110...

520
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,774
AND COUNTING.

521
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,344
SO, UH, NICE WORK, LESLIE.

522
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,379
- NICE WORK TO YOU TOO.
- OH.

523
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,448
UH, LEFT THE CHICKEN SOUP THERE,
JUST IN CASE.

524
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,716
IT'S AN OLD FAMILY RECIPE.

525
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,486
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL,
BUT...

526
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,488
- THANK YOU FOR THAT.
- OKAY.

527
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,327
- HI, APRIL.

528
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,429
[whispering]
IT'S ME, ANDY.

529
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:58,698
JUST STAY SLEEPING.

530
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:02,502
I AM GOING TO BE HERE
WHEN YOU WAKE UP.

531
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,637
I WILL NOT LEAVE
YOUR SIDE.

532
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:13,913
YOU COULD BE ASLEEP FOR HOURS.
MAYBE I'LL COME BACK LATER.

533
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,349
HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER.
OKAY.

534
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,585
OH, AND I KNOW YOU THINK
THAT I'M A JERK,

535
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,521
BUT I HOPE
YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.

536
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,593
GROSS.
YOUR FOREHEAD IS ALL SWEATY.

537
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,428
THAT'S GROSS.

538
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,299
BUT I STILL LIKE YOU.

539
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,366
OKAY.

540
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,402
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

541
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,677
- GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
WHAT'S UP?

542
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,446
- I GOT A CALL
FROM THE BOYS UPSTAIRS.

543
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,348
AND THEY HAVE
A NEW ASSIGNMENT FOR US.

544
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,616
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

545
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,952
AND I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD ASK
FOR AN EXTENSION TO STAY HERE.

546
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,987
- YES, DEFINITELY.
YOU KNOW...

547
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,656
THE FESTIVAL THING'S
GETTING PRETTY HUGE,

548
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,359
AND, UH, COUPLE LOOSE ENDS
THAT NEED TYING UP.

549
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,561
- GOOD, SO I'LL MAKE THE CALL,
THEN, TO GET THE EXTENSION?

550
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,430
- YEAH, THEY NEED OUR HELP.
- FOR THE LOOSE ENDS.

551
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,364
- GREAT.
- GOOD.

552
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,333
- OKAY, YOU NEED
A RIDE BACK TO THE OFFICE?

553
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,667
- NO, NO, I'M GONNA GO
FOR A LIGHT 15K.

554
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,035
I MISSED YESTERDAY.

555
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:12,572
WAY TO GO, BUDDY.
WAY TO GO.
