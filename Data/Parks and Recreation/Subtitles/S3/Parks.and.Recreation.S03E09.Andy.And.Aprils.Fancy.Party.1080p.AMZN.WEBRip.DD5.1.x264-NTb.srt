1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,736
- SO WHILE THEY REPAINT
THE LINES IN THE PARKING LOT,

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,539
WE'RE ASKING EVERYONE
TO DO STREET PARKING.

3
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,575
- I'M NOT STREET PARKING
MY MERCEDES.

4
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,410
- WELL, EVERYONE IS.
I'M DOING IT.

5
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,545
- 'CAUSE NOBODY WANTS
TO STEAL A SATURN.

6
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:14,682
- ALL RIGHT, UH,
MOVING ON TO RECYCLING.

7
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,517
[Ron groans]

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,486
- YOU OKAY, RON?
- JUST A LITTLE TOOTH PAIN.

9
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,288
I'M FINE.
CONTINUE.

10
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,656
- OKAY, EACH DEPARTMENT
WILL BE GETTING BLUE BINS--

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,125
- [groans in pain]

12
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,194
- DO YOU NEED TO GO
TO THE DENTIST, RON?

13
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,695
- I DON'T LIKE DENTISTS.

14
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,763
JUST A SECOND.

15
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:30,764
- HEY.
- NO, NO.

16
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:31,832
- NO!

17
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,167
- NO, NO, NO, NO!
NO, NO, NO, NO!

18
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,836
[all shouting]

19
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,505
all: AAH!

20
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,840
- OH!
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

21
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,375
- OH, MY GOD!

22
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,477
- I'M SORRY, EVERYBODY.
WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT--

23
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,479
RECYCLING?

24
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,748
DENTIST PULLED
THE TOOTH OUT YESTERDAY.

25
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,351
BUT IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA
TO DEMONSTRATE

26
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,486
TO YOUR CO-WORKERS
THAT YOU ARE CAPABLE

27
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,289
OF WITHSTANDING
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PAIN.

28
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:58,626
PLUS, IT'S ALWAYS FUN
TO SEE TOM FAINT.

29
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,861
[chuckling]

30
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,864
[triumphant music]

31
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:12,106
*

32
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,651
- ATTENTION, EVERYBODY!

33
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:24,718
- EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP.

34
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:28,689
- YOU ARE ALL OFFICIALLY INVITED
TO A DINNER PARTY,

35
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,224
7:00 P.M. TONIGHT
AT OUR HOME,

36
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:32,426
WHICH IS OFFICIALLY
MY FRIEND BURLY'S HOME,

37
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,195
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A HOME.

38
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:35,563
- THAT'S IT.
THERE'S NO MORE LEFT.

39
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,497
- GIVE IT TO HIM.

40
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,232
- WE'VE BEEN DATING
FOR ALMOST A MONTH,

41
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,733
SO WE JUST DECIDED

42
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,236
THAT WE WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

43
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,673
- AND DINNER PARTIES DO COMBINE
TWO OF OUR FAVORITE THINGS--

44
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,508
DINNER AND PARTIES.

45
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,842
- PARTIES.
- YEAH.

46
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:53,347
IT'S LIKE IF YOU COULD HAVE
A XBOX PANCAKE.

47
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:54,848
YOUR INVITATIONS
INCLUDE REQUESTS

48
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,550
FOR EACH OF YOU
TO BRING STUFF,

49
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,252
'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
A WHOLE LOT.

50
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,788
DON'T BE LATE.
- WATCH OUT. [laughs]

51
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,424
- "DEAREST TOM,
PLEASE BRING SILVERWARE."

52
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,294
- "PLEASE BRING COOKED STEAK."
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

53
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:07,561
- THEY'RE YOUNG.
THEY'RE IN LOVE.

54
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,363
THEY'RE READY TO SHOW IT
TO THE WORLD.

55
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:10,564
IT'S VERY SWEET.

56
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,433
AND WE'RE ALL GOING.
- WHAT?

57
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,668
THERE'S A BOY'S SALE
AT DILLARD'S TODAY.

58
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,204
- HEY.
- OH, HEY.

59
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:17,305
- YOU GOING TONIGHT?

60
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:20,341
- YEAH. APPARENTLY THEY WANT ME
TO BRING AVATAR

61
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:24,745
AND 50 PAIRS OF 3-D GLASSES
AND A 3-D-CAPABLE TELEVISION.

62
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:25,946
- MM.
- YEAH.

63
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,249
- WELL, I WILL SEE YOU THERE,
WITH ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

64
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,583
- I WAS ACTUALLY COMING
TO SEE YOU.

65
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:30,518
I WANTED YOUR ADVICE
ON SOMETHING.

66
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,786
- OH, YEAH?
- MY BOSS IN INDIANAPOLIS--

67
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,356
HE WANTS ME BACK ON THE ROAD
IN A WEEK.

68
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,626
BUT THEN THIS MORNING
CHRIS OFFERED ME A JOB

69
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,296
TO STAY HERE IN PAWNEE
AND WORK FOR HIM.

70
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,498
- DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT?
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

71
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,534
I'VE BEEN MOVING AROUND SO MUCH
THE PAST FEW YEARS,

72
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,902
IT MIGHT BE NICE TO STAY
IN ONE PLACE FOR A WHILE.

73
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:52,373
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- WELL, THIS IS A GREAT CITY.

74
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,974
YOU KNOW, IT'S DEFINITELY
THE BEST CITY IN INDIANA,

75
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,277
PROBABLY AMERICA,
POSSIBLY THE WORLD.

76
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,611
- SURE.

77
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,647
- BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
YOU'VE PUT IN 12 YEARS

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,715
WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT.

79
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,384
- SO YOU THINK
I SHOULD SAY NO TO CHRIS

80
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:07,388
AND HEAD BACK
TO INDIANAPOLIS OR...?

81
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,723
- IT'S A TOUGH CALL.
YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO?

82
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,625
YOU SHOULD MAKE
A PROS AND CONS LIST.

83
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,861
THAT ALWAYS WORKS FOR ME.
- YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.

84
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,663
OKAY, MAYBE I'LL DO THAT.

85
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,631
- EXCELLENT.
NICE TALKING TO YOU.

86
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,433
- GOOD STUFF.
- YEAH.

87
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,834
- OKAY.

88
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:25,973
- SO HOW DOES THIS WORK?

89
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,575
- ALL RIGHT, YOU JUST FILL OUT
YOUR NAME TAG,

90
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,643
AND YOU'RE ALL SET.
- OKAY.

91
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:33,614
BUT I-I MEAN, DO I JUST GO UP
AND TALK TO ANYONE,

92
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,517
OR DO I WAIT FOR THEM
TO TALK TO ME, OR...?

93
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,653
- ARE YOU ASKING ME
HOW TO FLIRT WITH MEN?

94
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,989
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

95
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,591
IT'S A WHOLE NEW ANN PERKINS.

96
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,260
I'M PUTTING MYSELF OUT THERE,
MEETING SOME NEW PEOPLE,

97
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:48,629
HAVING SOME CASUAL FUN,

98
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,532
AND IT IS...AWKWARD.

99
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,002
- GAYLE WENT OUT AND GOT ME
THIS NEW PARTY SHIRT.

100
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,571
SO BE HONEST--
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

101
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,706
- YOU KNOW WHAT, JERRY?

102
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,510
I MAKE FUN OF YOU A LOT,
BUT CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.

103
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:06,046
YOU KNOW, I LIKE HOW THE--
[laughing]

104
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,684
DAMN IT. I WAS SO CLOSE.
IT'S A TERRIBLE SHIRT.

105
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:13,053
- HEY, GUYS.
OKAY, EVERYBODY LISTEN UP.

106
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,723
APRIL'S FRIEND ORIN IS HERE.

107
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,958
HE'S VERY INTENSE
AND VERY WEIRD.

108
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,660
SO IF YOU END UP
TALKING TO HIM,

109
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:20,961
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T REVEAL

110
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,730
ANYTHING PERSONAL
ABOUT YOURSELF.

111
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,665
- HEY, GANG.
- HEY.

112
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,468
WHAT'D YOU BRING?
- I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE CAKE.

113
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,003
TO BE FAIR, IT'S NOT A CAKE SO
MUCH AS IT IS A VEGETABLE LOAF.

114
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,772
YOU GOT YOUR MUSHROOMS,
YOUR ALFALFA SPROUTS,

115
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:35,309
YOUR SPINACH, AND I HAD IT
SWEETENED WITH FRUIT REDUCTION.

116
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:38,679
- BUT DID THEY ASK YOU TO BRING
A VEGETABLE LOAF OR A CAKE?

117
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,781
- NO, A CAKE,
BUT THIS IS SO MUCH HEALTHIER.

118
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,317
- SO NOT ONLY
DOES THIS THING EXIST,

119
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:45,419
BUT NOW YOU HAVE DEPRIVED
EVERYONE OF CAKE.

120
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:47,755
- TAKE A WALK, RON.
- YEP.

121
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,795
- DONNA.
OH, MY GOD.

122
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,930
I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE YOU HERE.

123
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:01,335
THESE THINGS ARE HORRIBLE
WHEN YOU'RE BY YOURSELF.

124
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:02,536
WHAT?

125
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,538
- DO YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW?

126
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:07,040
WE'RE IN THE JUNGLE.
THERE ARE NO FRIENDS HERE.

127
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,543
IT'S EVERY WOMAN FOR HERSELF.

128
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:12,513
- YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?
- DO I LOOK LIKE I'M JOKING?

129
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,583
DATING IS A ZERO-SUM GAME.

130
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:19,487
IF YOU GET A MAN,
I DON'T GET THAT MAN.

131
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,954
- I'M HERE BECAUSE OF ADVICE
THAT YOU GAVE ME

132
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,990
TO BE MORE ADVENTUROUS
IN MY LIFE.

133
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,794
- HERE'S SOME MORE ADVICE--
BEAT IT.

134
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,128
- HEY.

135
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,464
- BEN, HEARD YOU
MIGHT BE LEAVING PAWNEE.

136
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:33,567
- I DON'T KNOW.
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.

137
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:34,868
- WELL, YOU ARE A HUGE NERD.

138
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,670
BUT I'D BE SORRY
TO SEE YOU GO, MAN.

139
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:37,938
- THANKS, TOM.

140
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,573
- OKAY, THIS PARTY NEEDS
A LITTLE HELP.

141
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:40,908
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

142
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,477
- SO ARE YOU GOING ON, LIKE,
A YEAR-LONG WALKING TOUR

143
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,112
OF THE SET
OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS

144
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,447
IN NEW ZEALAND?

145
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,449
- TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I WASN'T A FAN

146
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,083
OF, UH, PETER JACKSON'S
INTERPRETATION.

147
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,719
SO YOU CAN PUT
THAT ONE AWAY.

148
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,755
- ANDY, I THINK YOU MAYBE
SHOULD PUT SOME MORE FOOD OUT.

149
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:58,058
- TOTALLY AGREE. JUST FIRING UP
THE BAGEL BITES NOW.

150
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,860
- HEY.
- OH, MY GOD.

151
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,629
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

152
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:02,930
- APRIL, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO LET ME SEE YOU.

153
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,097
- NO, COME ON.
YOU HAVE TO LOOK.

154
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,634
THIS IS IMPORTANT. YOU HAVE
TO TELL ME IF I LOOK GOOD.

155
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,135
- HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S GOING ON?

156
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,704
- UH, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
A BIG SURPRISE.

157
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,105
BUT TONIGHT

158
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,843
ME AND APRIL
ARE GETTING MARRIED...

159
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,611
TO EACH OTHER.

160
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,449
- IS APRIL PREGNANT?

161
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:22,650
ARE YOU PREGNANT?
- YES.

162
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:23,451
- YES?
- NO.

163
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:24,452
- ARE YOU SICK?
ARE YOU TERMINAL?

164
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:26,454
IS IT LIKE THAT MOVIE
A WALK TO REMEMBER?

165
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:27,455
- YES.
- WHAT?

166
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:28,922
- NO. GOD.
- OH, GOD.

167
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,591
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

168
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,893
WHY IS THIS GREAT THING
HAPPENING?

169
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,629
- WELL, I MEAN, IT'S ACTUALLY
A REALLY FUNNY STORY.

170
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,831
WE WERE HANGING OUT.

171
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,501
AND SUDDENLY, I WAS LIKE,

172
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,202
"WHAT IF WE GOT MARRIED
TOMORROW?"

173
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,506
AND SHE WAS LIKE...

174
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,507
- "FINE."

175
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,042
- [softly] SHE'S FINE.
- THAT IS A GREAT STORY.

176
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,978
BUT YOU GUYS HAVEN'T BEEN
TOGETHER VERY LONG,

177
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,646
AND YOU HAVE NO PLACE
TO LIVE.

178
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,981
- WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
LONG ENOUGH,

179
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,449
AND WE'LL FIND A PLACE
TO LIVE.

180
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:56,450
- YEAH.

181
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:58,185
- LIKE, A HOUSE
OR, LIKE, A CONDO OR SOMETHING.

182
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,553
- PROBABLY A CONDO.

183
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,655
- IT'S--YOU CAN'T JUST GET
A CONDO.

184
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,658
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT--
HOUSE.

185
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,860
- I LOVE ANDY AND APRIL
AS A COUPLE.

186
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,796
I WANT THEM
TO STAY TOGETHER FOREVER.

187
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,499
BUT RELATIONSHIPS
NEED PLANNING.

188
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:14,502
YOU JUST CAN'T JUMP
INTO SOMETHING WITHOUT THINKING.

189
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,605
IT TOOK ME FOUR YEARS
TO FIND THE RIGHT HAIRDRESSER,

190
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:20,173
AND WE STILL FIGHT
ALL THE TIME!

191
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,109
ANDY AND APRIL
ARE GONNA SURPRISE PEOPLE

192
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,611
WITH A SECRET CEREMONY.

193
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,013
- WHOA.
SECRET WEDDING.

194
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,048
JULIA ROBERTS
PULLED THE SAME MOVE.

195
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,584
- IS THAT THAT TOOTHY GIRL
FROM MYSTIC PIZZA?

196
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,820
- RON, PLEASE, I NEED YOU
TO HELP ME KNOCK SOME SENSE

197
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:33,987
INTO THEM.

198
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:37,057
- IT'S NOT REALLY MY PLACE
OR YOURS.

199
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,760
- HI. I'M ANN.
- BRIAN.

200
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,228
- WHAT'S YOUR OCCUPATION?

201
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,597
- I'M A MANAGER
AT A SPORTING-GOODS STORE.

202
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,699
- NO WAY. ME TOO.
- SERIOUSLY? WHICH ONE?

203
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:50,170
- NO, I'M NOT.
UM, I-I WAS JUST RIBBING YOU.

204
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,940
- WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?
- [laughs] YEAH.

205
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,242
- WHAT?
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

206
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,277
I-I COULDN'T HEAR YOU.

207
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,248
- SO YOU JUST LAUGHED
AND SAID, "YEAH"?

208
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,217
- YEAH.
- EXCUSE US.

209
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,086
THAT WAS THE WORST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.

210
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,621
DID YOU GROW UP
IN THE WOODS?

211
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,823
ARE YOU NELL
FROM THE MOVIE NELL?

212
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:12,225
- I TOLD YOU I'M RUSTY.

213
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,061
- ALL RIGHT, COME WITH ME.

214
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,295
- HEY, ANDY.
- YEAH.

215
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,131
- I KNOW WHAT'S GOING DOWN,
AND I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS.

216
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,266
- THANK YOU, TOM.

217
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,934
- HEY, SOMETHING
JUST OCCURRED TO ME.

218
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,537
CAN I BE YOUR BEST MAN?
- YEAH, DUDE, TOTALLY.

219
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:25,172
- THANK YOU.
- MY BEST MAN.

220
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,540
- [mouths words]

221
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,709
ONE OF MY LIFE GOALS
IS TO BE A BEST MAN.

222
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,644
IT'S A BALLER POSITION.

223
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,179
YOU GET DRUNK.
YOU MAKE SPEECHES.

224
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,182
AND YOU MAKE LOVE
TO THE PRETTIEST BRIDESMAID,

225
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,250
USUALLY STANDING
FROM BEHIND.

226
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,787
- LOOK, I KNOW THAT
I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

227
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,321
I KNOW IT DOESN'T WORK...

228
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,791
FROM ALL THE TIMES I'VE TRIED
TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO BEFORE.

229
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,125
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT WOULD BE FUN?

230
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,561
MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE
A PROS AND CONS LIST.

231
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,730
LET ME TAKE YOU HOME, AND THEN
WE'LL GO DO THAT TOGETHER.

232
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:50,731
IT'LL BE A BLAST.

233
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,734
- LESLIE, RELAX.
- YOU RELAX.

234
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,169
YOU RELAX ALL THE WAY HOME
AND GET INTO BED.

235
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,706
YOU NEED TO GO TO BED.
- APRIL.

236
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,207
GIRL TALK.

237
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,710
HEY, UH,
WHAT'S YOUR MIDDLE NAME?

238
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,678
THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE LADY
NEEDS TO KNOW.

239
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,614
- YOU DON'T KNOW
EACH OTHER'S MIDDLE NAMES?

240
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,982
- I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT
OUT LOUD.

241
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,251
- [laughs] EW!
- SHUT UP.

242
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,822
- [laughing] ROBERTA!
- SUCH A LOSER.

243
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:17,791
CAN'T BELIEVE I'M MARRYING HIM.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

244
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:20,327
- I'M GOING TO.
AND THEN I'M GONNA DIVORCE HIM.

245
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,863
THEN I'M GONNA MARRY
HIM AGAIN.

246
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,333
- ONE TIME, I FELL MADLY IN LOVE
WITH A CIVIL WAR REENACTOR

247
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,235
THAT I HAD ONLY KNOWN
FOR SIX HOURS.

248
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,337
AND THEN I FOUND OUT
HE WORE THOSE CLOTHES

249
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,039
ALL THE TIME.

250
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,006
AND HE WAS MARRIED.

251
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,909
BUT THE CLOTHES THING
REALLY BOTHERED ME.

252
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,046
YOU ALWAYS WANT
TO SCRIBBLE THE NAME.

253
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,749
MAKE THEM READ.
DRAW THEM IN.

254
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,051
MAKE THEM WORK FOR IT.
- RIGHT.

255
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,352
- TWO SHOTS OF JAMESON.

256
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,321
DON'T MAKE
TOO MUCH EYE CONTACT.

257
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:51,324
YOU WANT TO SEEM AVAILABLE,
BUT NOT TOO AVAILABLE.

258
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,126
- OH, THANKS.
I THINK I'M GOOD FOR NOW.

259
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,195
I'M NOT GONNA--
- YEAH.

260
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:01,368
ALL RIGHT...
LET'S DO THIS.

261
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,370
- RON, YOU ARE SO AMAZING

262
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:07,240
WITH ME AND APRIL, STUFF.

263
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,076
I LOVE YOU, MAN.

264
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,144
WOULD YOU BE ONE
OF MY BEST MEN?

265
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:14,347
- I'D BE HONORED TO, SON.

266
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:17,150
- CHRIS, YOU HELPED ME
GET APRIL BACK.

267
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,986
WOULD YOU BE MY BEST MAN?

268
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,289
- NOTHING ELSE
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE

269
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,892
WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER
AS LONG AS I LIVE.

270
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:28,395
- JERRY. AH, I'M SO GLAD
YOU MADE IT.

271
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,763
THIS SHIRT IS HILARIOUS.

272
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:33,200
DEREK AND BEN,
WILL YOU BE MY BEST MEN?

273
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,869
- GOT A LITTLE COMPETITION
FOR THE BEST MAN, HUH?

274
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,271
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST
BEST MAN DOES.

275
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,273
EXCUSE ME!

276
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,843
ARE THERE ANY STRIPPERS HERE?

277
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,444
FORMER STRIPPERS?

278
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,980
NON-DANCERS BUT YOU'RE FEELING
A LITTLE BIT DRUNK?

279
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,381
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

280
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,250
- I'M THROWING ANDY
AN IMPROMPTU BACHELOR PARTY.

281
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,152
IT'S MY DUTY AS BEST MAN.

282
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,721
- THE WEDDING'S
IN FOUR MINUTES.

283
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,188
- IT'S THAT KIND
OF NEGATIVE THINKING

284
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,791
THAT MAKES YOU
A LESS GOOD BEST MAN.

285
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,326
[cell phone rings]
- HELLO?

286
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,227
- HI, ANN, IT'S LESLIE--

287
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,195
LESLIE KNOPE
FROM THE PARKS DEPARTMENT.

288
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,064
- YEAH, I KNOW.
WHERE ARE YOU?

289
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,866
- APRIL AND ANDY
ARE GETTING MARRIED TONIGHT.

290
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,768
- WHAT?
- YEAH, I KNOW.

291
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,002
I NEED YOU
TO GET DOWN HERE, ANN.

292
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:12,873
I NEED YOU TO KISS HIM AGAIN
OR KISS HER OR KISS SOMEBODY.

293
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,475
I DON'T KNOW, ANN!
HELP ME, PLEASE!

294
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,745
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE LIKE SCUBA DIVING.

295
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,748
IF YOU COME UP TOO FAST,
YOU GET THE BENDS.

296
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,049
AND THE REASON
WHY I KNOW THIS

297
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,250
IS BECAUSE I WAS DATING
A GUY ONCE,

298
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,217
AND WE WERE SCUBA DIVING,

299
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,086
AND I TOLD HIM
THAT I LOVED HIM UNDERWATER,

300
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,488
AND HE SHOT UP REALLY FAST,
AND HE GOT THE BENDS.

301
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,492
- NO, ORIN, I DON'T KNOW
HOW I'M GOING TO DIE.

302
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,494
WAIT. ARE YOU ASKING ME
OR TELLING ME?

303
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,363
- HEY, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

304
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,297
- YES, PLEASE.

305
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,332
- APRIL AND ANDY
ARE ABOUT TO GET MARRIED.

306
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,503
- WOW. MY BRITA FILTER IS OLDER
THAN THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

307
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,438
WAIT A SECOND.
SHOULD I CHANGE MY BRITA FILTER?

308
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,741
- I DON'T KNOW. IT DEPENDS
ON HOW FREQUENTLY YOU USE IT.

309
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,743
- IT'S TRUE.
- STAY FOCUSED, OKAY? PLEASE.

310
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:52,379
THE POINT IS TWO BONEHEADS
WHOM I LOVE DEARLY

311
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,947
ARE ABOUT
TO SACRIFICE THEIR FUTURE

312
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:55,515
'CAUSE THEY HAVEN'T THOUGHT
THIS THING THROUGH.

313
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,184
AND NOBODY SEEMS CONCERNED
ABOUT THIS.

314
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,353
- ATTENTION, EVERYBODY.
MADAMES AND...

315
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,123
MIS...WAHS.

316
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:06,259
IF YOU WOULD DO ME
THE OBLIGATION

317
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:11,398
OF HAVING YOUR HONOR HERETOFORE
IN THE ROOM

318
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:14,301
DOTH RIGHT OVER THERE,
UH, HENCE.

319
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,435
- WHAT?

320
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,437
- BIG EVENT IN THAT ROOM,
15 MINUTES.

321
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,339
- OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING.

322
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:23,210
I LOVE APRIL AND ANDY.
I WANT THEM TO STAY TOGETHER.

323
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,413
AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE TO STOP
THEIR WEDDING.

324
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,282
- HI, GUYS.

325
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,951
REMEMBER HOW I TOLD YOU
THERE WAS GOING TO BE

326
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,452
A SURPRISE LATER?

327
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,288
WELL, THE SURPRISE IS YOU'RE NOT
ACTUALLY AT A DINNER PARTY.

328
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:38,792
YOU'RE AT OUR WEDDING.

329
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,028
[applause]

330
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,197
ALL RIGHT.
UH, LET'S DO THIS.

331
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,868
[Simon & Garfunkel's
April Come She Will]

332
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:56,343
*

333
00:12:56,376 --> 00:13:00,547
- * APRIL

334
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,951
* COME SHE WILL

335
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:08,121
* WHEN STREAMS ARE RIPE
AND SWELLED WITH RAIN *

336
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,923
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

337
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,124
WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY

338
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:17,264
TO MARRY ANDREW MAXWELL DWYER
AND APRIL ROBERTA LUDGATE.

339
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,567
- I GUESS I KIND OF HATE
MOST THINGS.

340
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,571
BUT I NEVER REALLY SEEM
TO HATE YOU.

341
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,340
SO I WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH YOU.

342
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,442
IS THAT COOL?
- YES.

343
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,211
[paper shuffling]

344
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,412
IS IT MY TURN?
- YES.

345
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:36,016
- "APRIL, YOU'RE THE MOST
AWESOME PERSON I HAVE EVER KNOWN

346
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,084
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

347
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:41,488
I VOW TO PROTECT YOU
FROM DANGER."

348
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,891
AND I DON'T CARE
IF I HAVE TO FIGHT

349
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,393
AN ULTIMATE FIGHTER
OR A BEAR OR HIM,

350
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,628
YOUR MOM--
I WOULD TAKE THEM DOWN.

351
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,163
- ANDY.

352
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,265
- I'M GETTING MAD RIGHT NOW
EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT.

353
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,400
I'M TELLING YOU.
- IT'S OKAY.

354
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,536
- I WANT TO SPEND THE REST
OF MY LIFE--

355
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,971
EVERY MINUTE--
WITH YOU.

356
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:02,475
AND I'M THE LUCKIEST MAN
IN THE GALAXY.

357
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,612
- AND NOW THE RINGS.

358
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,548
- * THE AUTUMN WINDS BLOW
CHILLY AND COLD *

359
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,152
- BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME
BY THE STATE OF INDIANA,

360
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,388
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU HUSBAND
AND WIFE.

361
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,190
[applause]

362
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,097
- GO FLY AWAY.
- FLY. FLY.

363
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,933
- WINGS OF LOVE.
- OH.

364
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,167
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

365
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,468
SO THAT ONE IS DEAD.
WE KNOW THAT.

366
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,972
[House of Pain's
Jump Around]

367
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,375
*

368
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,410
- * PACK IT UP, PACK IT IN,
LET ME BEGIN *

369
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,478
* I CAME TO WIN

370
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:41,214
* BATTLE ME, THAT'S A SIN

371
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,450
- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO STOP IT, YOU KNOW.

372
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,653
- I COULD'VE YELLED SOMETHING
OR TACKLED SOMEONE.

373
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,322
- BUT YOU DIDN'T,
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN,

374
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,991
YOU KNEW
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED.

375
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,692
THOSE KIDS ARE GONNA DO
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.

376
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,394
- THEY MAY HAVE JUST RUINED
THEIR LIVES

377
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,463
ON AN IMPULSE DECISION.

378
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,465
- LESLIE,
I GOT MARRIED TWICE.

379
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,968
BOTH TIMES, I WAS A LOT OLDER
THAN THOSE TWO.

380
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:04,504
AND BOTH MARRIAGES ENDED
IN DIVORCE...

381
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,406
AND A BURNING EFFIGY.

382
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,942
WHO'S TO SAY WHAT WORKS?

383
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:12,279
YOU FIND SOMEBODY YOU LIKE,
AND YOU ROLL THE DICE.

384
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:15,082
THAT'S ALL ANYBODY CAN DO.

385
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,350
- WAIT. WEREN'T YOU MARRIED
THREE TIMES?

386
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,353
- OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT.

387
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,389
[chuckles]

388
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,391
I GET TO BURN
ANOTHER EFFIGY.

389
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,060
THE KEY TO BURNING
AN EX-WIFE EFFIGY

390
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,229
IS TO DIP IT IN PARAFFIN WAX

391
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,066
AND THEN TOSS THE FLAMING BOTTLE
OF ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL...

392
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,667
FROM A SAFE DISTANCE.

393
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,536
DO NOT STAND TOO CLOSE

394
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,439
WHEN YOU LIGHT
AN EX-WIFE EFFIGY.

395
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:43,110
- MY SISTER IS LAME,
BUT ANDY'S SORT OF COOL.

396
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,645
I GUESS I KIND OF SEE
WHY HE'D MARRY HER.

397
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,381
ALSO, IF ANYONE FINDS
MY GRAY HOODIE, I LOST IT.

398
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,050
THANKS.

399
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,619
[applause]

400
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,321
- THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

401
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:59,426
- YOU TWO REMIND ME
OF ME AND MY HUSBAND, GEORGE.

402
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,328
- I GOT TO NAIL THE SPEECH.

403
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,663
SO I BROUGHT IN AN EXPERT--
JEAN-RALPHIO.

404
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,465
- CAN I THROW SOMETHING ON YOU,
SEE IF IT FEELS GOOD?

405
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,666
- SURE.

406
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,235
- OKAY, THIS IS WHAT I WOULD DO.
I WOULD START WITH A JOKE.

407
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:11,238
JOKE, VINCE VAUGHN QUOTE,
OBVIOUSLY.

408
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,673
- SWINGERS OR CRASHERS?
- FRED CLAUS.

409
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,475
TALK ABOUT
ANDY'S EX-GIRLFRIENDS.

410
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:20,347
QUOTE FROM LOVE ACTUALLY.
HOLD BACK YOUR TEARS. PAUSE.

411
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,049
DROP THE MICROPHONE.
GET OUT OF THAT BITCH.

412
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,316
[imitates explosion]

413
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,718
- I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK,
TO BOTH OF YOU.

414
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,657
- AW, THANK YOU, GRANDMA.

415
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,493
HOW CAN ANYONE
EVER POSSIBLY TOP THAT?

416
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,428
AM I RIGHT?

417
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,364
SO THANK YOU ALL
FOR ALL THE TALKING.

418
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,166
LET'S JUST GET
BACK TO DANCING, HUH?

419
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,468
[cheers and applause]

420
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:45,038
- COOL.
SEE YOU AROUND MAYBE.

421
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:47,740
- THAT WENT BETTER, RIGHT?
- YES, IT DID.

422
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:51,078
HOWEVER, HE PROUDLY TOLD ME
THAT HE "BEAT HERPES."

423
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,313
I'M SORRY, DONNA.
I'M GONNA GO HOME.

424
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,382
I JUST FOUND OUT
ANDY'S GETTING MARRIED.

425
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,718
- SO?
- SO THAT'S MY EX-BOYFRIEND.

426
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,320
WE WERE TOGETHER
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

427
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,056
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT?

428
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,559
- WHAT? LISTEN, YOU ARE A HOT,
YOUNG DOCTOR.

429
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,628
- I'M A NURSE, ACTUALLY.
- OKAY, I DON'T KNOW YOU.

430
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,131
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT YOU CAN FIX YOUR ATTITUDE.

431
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,665
DO YOU WANT TO GO HOME
AND FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF

432
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,367
ABOUT A MAN YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO MARRY?

433
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,768
OR DO YOU WANT TO GO TALK
TO THAT CUTE BOY

434
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,471
WHO HAS BEEN LOOKING AT YOU
AND GIVE HIM YOUR NUMBER

435
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:23,076
BEFORE I THROW HIM IN MY BENZ
FOR MYSELF?

436
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,678
- ALL RIGHT.

437
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,416
- I JUST WANT TO THANK
MY FAMILY, MY FRIENDS,

438
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:32,352
MOST IMPORTANTLY,
MY BES BEST MAN,

439
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,653
MR. TOM HAVERFORD.

440
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,423
OH!
COOLEST GUY I KNOW.

441
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,358
AND, LADIES, HE'S SINGLE,
I THINK.

442
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,426
YOU'RE NOT STILL MARRIED,
ARE YOU?

443
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,795
- NO.
- BUT YOU--YOU'RE STRAIGHT?

444
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,764
- YES.
- JEAN-RALPHIO'S JUST A FRIEND?

445
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,633
- YEAH.
- YEAH!

446
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,537
ANYWAYS, OH, MY GOD,
I'M MARRIED!

447
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,506
THIS IS CRAZY.
WHAT HAPPENED?

448
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,477
BUT, SERIOUSLY,
LIFE IS SHORT, RIGHT?

449
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,812
UH, JUST--I REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD JUST DO

450
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,314
WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY.

451
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,750
THAT'S WHAT APRIL AND I DID.

452
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,352
WE ARE IN LOVE.

453
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,587
SO WE DIDN'T OVERTHINK IT.

454
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,125
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
I CANNOT EMPHASIZE

455
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,893
HOW LITTLE WE THOUGHT
ABOUT THIS.

456
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,562
AM I RIGHT?

457
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:19,432
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THIS IS A SONG
I WROTE FOR YOU,

458
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,169

I LOVE YOU.
- [mouths words]

460
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:29,909
- * YEAH, YEAH, GRANDMA

461
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:34,447
* BABY,
THERE'S SO LITTLE TIME *

462
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:38,485
* ANYTHING I WANT TO DO

463
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,722
* LET'S FLY TO THE SKY

464
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:45,725
* 'CAUSE IT'S SO AWESOME

465
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,694
- EXACTLY. MORTALITY.

466
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,429
SEE, I LIKE TO TAKE EACH DAY
AT A TIME.

467
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,832
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WORLD
WE CAN'T ACCOMPLISH IF WE TRY.

468
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,301
- I HAVE TO GO.

469
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:57,437
- IT'S BEEN GREAT TALKING
TO YOU.

470
00:18:58,505 --> 00:18:59,939
- HEY.
- DON'T WORRY.

471
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,508
I'M NOT GONNA SAY
ANOTHER WORD.

472
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,642
THIS IS YOUR DAY.

473
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:06,579
- I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THAT...

474
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:09,382
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

475
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,319
I THINK YOU'RE AWESOME,
AND I LOVE YOU.

476
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:14,854
- OH.

477
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:18,291
- * WE DO ANYTHING TOGETHER

478
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,926
- WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THAT HOT GIRL, APRIL?

479
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,861
- WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH HER?
- YEAH.

480
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,364
LIKE, SHE GOOD TO GO?
LIKE, SHE DOWN TO CLOWN?

481
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:27,700
- SHE'S MARRIED.

482
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,436
SHE GOT MARRIED,
LIKE, 20 MINUTES AGO.

483
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,372
- OH, MY GOD. THAT'S THE SAME
GIRL FROM THE THING.

484
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,374

485
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,676
- ALL THE GOOD ONES

486
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,446

- YOU THINK?
- YEAH. YES.

495
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,501
IT'S A GREAT CITY HERE,

496
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,602
AND THERE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.

497
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,304
AND YOU'VE MADE A LOT
OF FRIENDS.

00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,438
AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO--

00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:09,542
GO BACK TO YOUR OLD JOB
AND HACK UP PEOPLE'S BUDGETS?

500
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:12,379
STAY HERE.
HELP US BUILD SOMETHING.

501
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,914
