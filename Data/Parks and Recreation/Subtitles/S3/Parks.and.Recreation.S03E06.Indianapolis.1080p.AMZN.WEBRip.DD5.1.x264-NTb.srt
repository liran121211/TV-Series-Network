1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:03,371
- NOW, AFTER WE ARE
GIVEN THE CERTIFICATE,

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:05,406
WHO DO YOU THINK
SHOULD SPEAK FIRST?

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,141
I THINK IT SHOULD BE ME
AND THEN YOU.

4
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:09,377
BUT, IF YOU WANT,
IT COULD BE YOU AND THEN ME.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,379
OR IT COULD GO ME, YOU, ME.

6
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:13,347
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- HOW ABOUT JUST YOU?

7
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,248
- THANK YOU, RON. YES.

8
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:16,150
TOMORROW,
THE PARKS AND REC DEPARTMENT

9
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:19,687
IS RECEIVING A COMMENDATION
AT THE INDIANA STATEHOUSE

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,789
FOR BRINGING
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL BACK.

11
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,058
AND ALTHOUGH
IT'S PURELY CEREMONIAL,

12
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:26,360
IT'S A HUGE DEAL FOR ME
TO GO TO THE STATEHOUSE.

13
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,363
- I COULDN'T CARE LESS
ABOUT THE COMMENDATION.

14
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:34,168
BUT INDIANAPOLIS IS HOME TO
CHARLES MULLIGAN'S STEAKHOUSE,

15
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:37,105
THE BEST DAMN STEAKHOUSE
IN THE DAMN STATE.

16
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:40,408
I HAVE TAKEN A PICTURE OF EVERY
STEAK I'VE EVER EATEN THERE.

17
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,076
JUNE 2004.

18
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,213
PORTERHOUSE, MEDIUM RARE,
BEARNAISE SAUCE.

19
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:46,480
JANUARY 2000.

20
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:48,316
THEY CALL THIS ONE
"THE ENFORCER."

21
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:50,184
FEBRUARY '96.

22
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:53,821
THE STEAK: RIB-EYE.
THE WHISKEY: LAGAVULIN 16.

23
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:56,590
THE LADY NEXT TO ME:
A BITCH.

24
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:58,692
SPECIFICALLY,
MY EX-WIFE TAMMY.

25
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,761
OKAY, THIS IS--
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

26
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,296
I EVER WENT THERE.

27
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,300
OH, LOOK AT ME.
I'M JUST A KID.

28
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:09,303
[triumphant music]

29
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:17,345
*

30
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,122
- SHE'S SHOWING
SOME ELEPHANT PIC--

31
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:31,225
OH, LA LA!
LOOK WHO'S FANCY!

32
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,462
- OH, AM I WEARING AN ASCOT?
I DIDN'T NOTICE.

33
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,730
BIG NIGHT
AT THE SNAKEHOLE LOUNGE.

34
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:37,931
IT'S A LAUNCH PARTY

35
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:41,835
FOR DENNIS FEINSTEIN'S NEW
FRAGRANCE: ALLERGIC--FOR MEN.

36
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,505
PAWNEE'S OWN DENNIS FEINSTEIN
IS A REAL UP-AND-COMER

37
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,807
IN THE WORLD OF MICROBREWED
PERFUMES AND BODY SPRAYS.

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,177
HIS ETHER-BASED PERFUME
"BLACKOUT"

39
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,345
WAS NAMED ONE
OF MAXIM'S TOP 100 WAYS

40
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,181
TO TRICK SOMEONE INTO SEX.

41
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:55,683
THE CLUB OPENS AT 6:00,
EVENT STARTS AT 9:00.

42
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:56,817
- OH, NO, NO, WAY TOO LATE.

43
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,519
I WILL BE DEEP
INTO MY BATH BY THEN.

44
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:02,190
- DON'T LET US PICTURE THAT.
BEN, YOU GONNA GO?

45
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:04,258
- OH, UH, I DON'T THINK SO.

46
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:05,593
PROBABLY JUST GONNA
TAKE IT EASY,

47
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,894
BUT THANK YOU.

48
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,462
YOU KNOW, THEY ALWAYS ASK ME
TO GO OUT WITH THEM.

49
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:09,763
THEY'RE JUST BEING POLITE.

50
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,165
I MOVE AROUND A LOT,

51
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,400
SO THE FRIENDS I MAKE
IN THESE CITIES,

52
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:15,303
THEY'RE LIKE
FACEBOOK FRIENDS, YOU KNOW?

53
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:20,208
"HEY, DOUG FROM BLOOMINGTON IS
THINKING ABOUT BUYING A SHIRT."

54
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:22,543
I MEAN, COME ON, DOUG,
WHO CARES?

55
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,445
- OKAY, TOM,
I WANT YOU TO TAKE BEN

56
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,447
AND MAKE HIM GO
TO THAT ANTIHISTAMINE PARTY.

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,216
- IT'S "ALLERGIC,"
AND FORGET IT.

58
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,317
- HE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYBODY IN TOWN.

59
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,386
COME ON, TOM, TAKE HIM UNDER
YOUR TINY LITTLE WING.

60
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,921
- HE'S A FULLY GROWN MAN,
LESLIE.

61
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,723
AND TONIGHT'S JUST NOT
ABOUT PLEASURE.

62
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,725
I'M SCHMOOZING
DENNIS FEINSTEIN

63
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,361
SO I CAN PITCH HIM
MY NEW COLOGNE, "TOMMY FRESH."

64
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,862
- OKAY, WELL,
WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT,

65
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,864
I WANT YOU TO PICTURE BEN
IN HIS MOTEL ROOM,

66
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,234
ALL BY HIMSELF WITH NO FRIENDS,
STARING AT THE WALL.

67
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:46,934
- DEAL.
- TOM.

68
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,269
- [sighs]

69
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,970
- SO MY BAND'S WORKING
ON A NEW ALBUM.

70
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,071
- OH, YEAH?
WHAT'S IT CALLED?

71
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:55,776
- APRIL LUDGATE IS
THE BEST EVER, VOLUME ONE.

72
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,745
- SHUT UP.

73
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,247
- SO, UH, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO TONIGHT?

74
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,781
WE COULD WATCH TV
AT BURLY'S HOUSE

75
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,284
OR WE COULD WATCH TV
AT YOUR HOUSE.

76
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,985
OR, I MEAN, WE COULD
WATCH TV AT BEST BUY.

77
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,720
- WHY DON'T WE GO
TO TOM'S THING?

78
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,623
THAT WEIRD COLOGNE PARTY THING
AT THE SNAKEHOLE?

79
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:10,458
- OH.

80
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:12,693
I KIND OF FORGOT
THAT YOU NEED MONEY

81
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,262
WHEN YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

82
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,663
EH!

83
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,531
I WANT TO TREAT APRIL
LIKE A QUEEN,

84
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:23,637
AND QUEENS DESERVE FLOWERS
AND MASSAGES,

85
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,973
CHOCOLATE, BOOZE,

86
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,008
DIAMONDS, RUBIES, EMERALDS,

87
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,711
THEM TREASURE CHESTS
FULL OF SCARVES,

88
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,613
DIFFERENT KINDS OF LUBES
THAT WARM UP

89
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,248
WHEN YOU RUB 'EM ON STUFF.

90
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,817
I'M GONNA GIVE HER
ALL THAT STUFF AND MORE.

91
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,787
HMM, THAT SOUNDS PRETTY AWESOME.
YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

92
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,788
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

93
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,790
- ALL RIGHT. BYE.
- BYE.

94
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,959
- I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS WE'RE DATING.

95
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:51,765
IT'S NEW. WHATEVER.
I DON'T LIKE LABELS.

96
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,867
GO AWAY.

97
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,504
- THIS?
- THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

98
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,971
- BUT DOES IT SAY,
"HELLO, GENERAL ASSEMBLY,

99
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,841
I'VE COME TO INDIANAPOLIS
TO ACCEPT YOUR COMMENDATION"?

100
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,443
- AS MUCH AS
ANY ONE DRESS COULD.

101
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:03,377
- HMM.

102
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:05,045
- LESLIE, I THINK CHRIS
IS CHEATING ON ME.

103
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,448
- WHAT?
THAT LYING BASTARD.

104
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,516
WAIT.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

105
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,918
- I DON'T HAVE
ANY ACTUAL PROOF.

106
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,586
- OH, THEN I'M SURE
HE'S NOT CHEATING ON YOU.

107
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,389
AND IF HE IS,
HE'S A MONSTER.

108
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,458
AND IF HE'S NOT,
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT TOGETHER.

109
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,859
BUT IF HE IS,
I WILL KILL HIM.

110
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,728
- WELL, WE HAD
A REALLY GOOD CONVERSATION

111
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,330
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP
LAST WEEK,

112
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,997
AND HE WAS VERY REASSURING

113
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,566
THAT WE'RE HEADED
IN A GOOD DIRECTION.

114
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,367
- GREAT.

115
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,569
- BUT THEN HE GOT DISTANT.
- OH.

116
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,504
- AND WHEN I ASKED TO COME
VISIT HIM IN INDIANAPOLIS,

117
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,573
HE WAS TOTALLY WEIRD.

118
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,042
HE WAS WEIRD.

119
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:35,909
- LOOK, IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE JUST SPIRALING.

120
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,578
- BUT WHAT IF I'M NOT?
WHAT IF I'M NOT?

121
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,647
WHAT IF HE
HAS A GIRL UP THERE?

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,515
I THINK
HE'S CHEATING ON ME.

123
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:42,783
- WOW. OKAY.

124
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,918
WELL, LUCKILY,
I'M HEADING UP THERE.

125
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,487
I'LL--I'LL INVITE HIM
OUT TO DINNER

126
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,621
AND I'LL POKE AROUND
A LITTLE BIT.

127
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,523
- OKAY.

128
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:51,091
- I MEAN, HE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO KEEP ANYTHING FROM ME.

129
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,794
IN HIGH SCHOOL, THEY USED TO
CALL ME ANGELA LANSBURY.

130
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,630
BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE
OF MY HAIRCUT.

131
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:57,865
- HEY, CHAMP.

132
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,000
- HEY, CHAMP...ION.

133
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,069
- LISTEN, YOU SHOULD
COME OUT TONIGHT.

134
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,771
THE CLUB'S GONNA BE DOPE.

135
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,406
PLUS, I'M PRETTY SURE YOU
HAVE NOTHING ELSE GOING ON.

136
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,940
- WELL, THAT'S NOT
TOTALLY TRUE.

137
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,876
THE OWNER OF THE MOTEL
I'M STAYING AT

138
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,078
SAID SHE WAS GONNA SCREEN
HOPE FLOATS IN THE LOBBY.

139
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,780
ASKED ME
IF I WANTED TO WATCH.

140
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,948
- YEAH. YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GET OUT OF THAT.

141
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,116
I THINK
SHE'S GONNA MURDER YOU.

142
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,685
COME ON DOWN
TO THE SNAKEHOLE.

143
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,653
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

144
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,089
- OKAY. YEAH, NO,
I'LL--I'LL STOP BY.

145
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,090
THANK YOU.
- COOL.

146
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,425
HEY, YOU MIND IF I ASK?

147
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,426
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA WEAR TONIGHT?

148
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,660
- UH, YOU KNOW,

149
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,929
I WAS PROBABLY JUST
GONNA STICK WITH THIS.

150
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,831
- [laughs]
COME ON, SERIOUSLY.

151
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:31,965
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA WEAR?

152
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:32,800
- OH, SOMETHING
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

153
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,502
PROBABLY GO HOME
AND GRAB SOMETHING.

154
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,069
- COOL.

155
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,907
- IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING
TO JUST TAKE A BRIEF PIT STOP,

156
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,378
WE COULD SEE INDIANA'S
SECOND LARGEST ROCKING CHAIR.

157
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:45,779
- NO.

158
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,749
- THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE
A QUICK TWO-HOUR SOJOURN

159
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:52,019
TO DAME GERVIN'S MISSHAPEN
CELEBRITY CASTLE.

160
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,456
IT'S WHERE MADAME TUSSAUD SENDS
ALL OF ITS FAILED WAX FIGURES,

161
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:56,890
AND IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT
WHO IT IS,

162
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:59,126
YOU GET TO TAKE IT HOME.
- NO.

163
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,861
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,
GROUCHY PANTS?

164
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:04,064
- I'VE BEEN FASTING ALL DAY
TO SAVE ROOM FOR MULLIGAN'S.

165
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,833
- FASTING'S NOT HEALTHY
FOR YOU, RON.

166
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,435
- LESLIE,
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND,

167
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:10,070
WE ARE HEADING FOR THE MOST
SPECIAL PLACE ON EARTH.

168
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,839
WHEN I'M DONE EATING
A MULLIGAN'S MEAL,

169
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,575
FOR WEEKS AFTERWARDS,
THERE ARE FLECKS OF MEAT

170
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,044
IN MY MUSTACHE,
AND I REFUSE TO CLEAN IT

171
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,446
BECAUSE EVERY NOW AND THEN,

172
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,714
A PIECE OF MEAT
WILL FALL INTO MY MOUTH.

173
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:21,782
- OH, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,

174
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,751
CHRIS TRAEGER IS JOINING US
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

175
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,152
- PLEASE TELL ME HE'S
MEETING US AT THE RESTAURANT.

176
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,153
- NO.
WE ARE PICKING HIM UP.

177
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,921
- DAMN IT, WOMAN!

178
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,859
- WELCOME. I AM SO GLAD
YOU GUYS CALLED.

179
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,026
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.
COME ON IN, COME ON IN.

180
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,628
- SURE.
- OR WE COULD JUST--

181
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:37,831
- WOW!
LOOK AT YOUR FOYER.

182
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,133
IT'S LIKE A SPA IN HERE.
- EXACTLY.

183
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,902
THE ENTRANCEWAY
TO YOUR HOUSE

184
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,571
SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD
ABOUT WHO YOU ARE.

185
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:46,807
AND THE FRONT DOOR PROVIDES
ENERGY FLOW AND OPPORTUNITY.

186
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,975
YOU CANNOT LIMIT THAT.

187
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,843
- YEAH. RON DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE A FRONT DOOR.

188
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,178
HE WON'T EVEN TELL ME
HIS ADDRESS.

189
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,747
ASK HIM WHERE HE LIVES.
- WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

190
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:54,882
- WHY?

191
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,919
- SO THIS IS SOME KIND OF
COAT CLOSET OR SOMETHING?

192
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,556
AH! WOW. THERE'S A LOT
OF MEN'S COATS IN HERE.

193
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,757
- I LIKE COATS.

194
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,093
- COULD I USE YOUR BATHROOM
REALLY QUICK?

195
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,928
- IT'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
- GREAT.

196
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,764
OH, THE TOILET SEAT'S UP.

197
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,100
[music playing]

198
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:17,237
- HEY, LET ME GET A BEER
AND A PAWNEE SUNRISE.

199
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,006
- DO YOU WANT TO PAY CASH
OR START A TAB?

200
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,809
- I--IT'S O--
UH, I-I KNOW TOM.

201
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:24,478
- TOM WHO?
- TOM HAMMEN--HAMMENSTEIN.

202
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:25,679
- HAVERFORD.
- HAVERFORD.

203
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,047
HE'S, LIKE,
MY BEST FRIEND.

204
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,783
- HEY, FREDDY, THIS GUY
SAYS HE KNOWS TOM

205
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:30,851
AND WANTS A DRINK FOR FREE.

206
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,020
- YOU, UH, YOU HAVE MONEY
TO PAY FOR THOSE DRINKS?

207
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,689
- YES.

208
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:36,924
NO.

209
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,092
- MAKE ROOM FOR
THE PAYING CUSTOMERS, HUH?

210
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:43,764
- LET'S GO, KNOPE!

211
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,065
- JUST ONE SECOND.

212
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,166
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

213
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,068
- HEY, I THINK
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

214
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,739
I FOUND A WOMEN'S RAZOR
IN CHRIS' SHOWER

215
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,106
AND A PINK SWIMMING CAP.

216
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,808
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
WHAT THE HELL?

217
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,610
- YOU KNOW,
IT COULD BE NOTHING,

218
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,145
BUT IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING.
I DON'T--

219
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,813
- I'M COMING UP THERE.
[phone receiver clicks]

220
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:00,948
- WAIT.

221
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:01,982
[horn honks]

222
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,250
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

223
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,953
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

224
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,923
- OH, MY GOD.
[rattles door handle]

225
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,059
THEY--THEY JUST FORGOT TO
UNLOCK THE DOOR, THAT'S ALL.

226
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,193
[rattling]

227
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,295
- RON, IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE CLOSED

228
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,230
FOR SOME KIND OF
HEALTH CODE VIOLATION.

229
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,999
[bangs]

230
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,134
- AAH!
- RON, STOP IT! RON?

231
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:29,877
- THEY JUST BOARDED HER UP LIKE
SHE WAS SOME COMMON WAREHOUSE.

232
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,012
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

233
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,246
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE STEAKS

234
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,550
THAT WERE IN THERE
WHEN THEY CLOSED?

235
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,285
DO YOU THINK
THEY GOT EATEN?

236
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,788
- WHY DON'T WE GO BACK
TO MY PLACE

237
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,890
AND I'LL FIRE UP
THE GRILL?

238
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,258
- YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING
COMPANY OR SOMETHING?

239
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,960
- NO.

240
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:47,928
WHAT DO YOU SAY, RON?

241
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,830
GO BACK TO MY PLACE
AND MAKE YOU SOME GRUB?

242
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,801
IT'LL BE JUST AS GOOD AS IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE.

243
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,068
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

244
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:59,006
- THAT MAN IS A LEGEND.

245
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,774
THINK ABOUT ALL THE SCENTS
HE'S CREATED.

246
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:05,913
ATTACK, YEARNING, THICKENING,
ITCH, COMA, SIDEBOOB.

247
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,081
- DENNIS FEINSTEIN, THOUGH?
I DON'T KNOW.

248
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:08,916
HE SHOULD PROBABLY
CHANGE HIS NAME

249
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,651
TO SOMETHING A LITTLE
MORE EXOTIC

250
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,053
IF HE WANTS TO MAKE IT
BIG IN PERFUME.

251
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,022
- OH, HIS REAL NAME
IS DANTE FIERO,

252
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,824
BUT HE CHANGED IT
TO DENNIS FEINSTEIN

253
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,258
'CAUSE THAT'S WAY
MORE EXOTIC IN PAWNEE.

254
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,327
- OKAY.
SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

255
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,197
- WAIT TILL HE'S ALONE,
THEN I WALK UP AND SPRAY HIM

256
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,668
WITH TOMMY FRESH,
AND I SAY, "UH-OH.

257
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,302
LOOKS LIKE YOU JUST
NAILED YOUR FUTURE."

258
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:35,008
- YEAH. THAT MIGHT
ACTUALLY WORK.

259
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,610
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

260
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:40,948
- UM, IT KIND OF SUCKS
THAT I'M SUPER BROKE

261
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,315
AND I WANT TO BUY YOU STUFF

262
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:45,018
AND IT'S EMBARRASSING
THAT I CAN'T, BUT--

263
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,320
- I'M BROKE TOO,
AND I DON'T WANT ANYTHING.

264
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,022
I JUST WANT TO
HANG OUT WITH YOU.

265
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,258
PLUS, I CAN GET FREE DRINKS
ANYTIME I WANT.

266
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,693
- HOW?

267
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:56,029
- UH, I'M A GIRL
IN A SLEAZY CLUB.

268
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:58,365
HEY.

269
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,733
- HEY.

270
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,068
- I HATE DRINKING ALONE.

271
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,135
- CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?

272
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,037
- SURE.
TRIPLE WHISKEY.

273
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,405
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

274
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,675
- OPRAH.
- I'M KEVIN.

275
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,243
- COOL. I KIND OF
WANT TO DRINK ALONE.

276
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,745
- BUT--
- I SAID I WANT TO DRINK ALONE.

277
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,647
THANKS. BYE.

278
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,115
HERE. YOU TAKE THIS ONE.

279
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:21,054
I WILL, UM, GET MYSELF
A MARTINI FROM THAT IDIOT.

280
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,992
- SO, CHRIS, DO YOU
HAVE ANY SISTERS?

281
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,827
- NO, I DON'T, LESLIE.
DO YOU HAVE SISTERS?

282
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,262
- MAYBE. SO HOW'S YOUR MOM?
IS SHE VISITING?

283
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,798
- NO, SHE'S HOME
UP IN WISCONSIN.

284
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,099
IS YOUR MOM VISITING?
- ANY AUNTS?

285
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,034
- NOPE. YOU HAVE AUNTS?
- GIRL COUSINS?

286
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,236
A YOUTHFUL GRANDMOTHER, PERHAPS?
- NOPE.

287
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,106
- DID YOU FORGET
HOW TO HAVE A CONVERSATION?

288
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,140
- I AM SO HAPPY
YOU GUYS ARE HERE.

289
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,943
I'M GONNA GO
FIRE UP THE GRILL.

290
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,345
- I'M GONNA KILL HIM, RON.
- WHY?

291
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,782
- CHRIS IS CHEATING ON ANN.
THERE'S EVIDENCE EVERYWHERE.

292
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,984
SHE'S COMING UP HERE
SO THEY CAN HAVE IT OUT.

293
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:54,021
- ASK HER TO BRING
SOME GARLIC SALT.

294
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,224
I'M WORRIED
CHRIS DOESN'T HAVE ANY.

295
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,992
[music playing]

296
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,028
- [gasps]
- I GOT THIS FROM A WAITER.

297
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,930
I TOLD HIM I HAD
A PORK DEFICIENCY.

298
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,164
- SWEET!
PIGS IN A BLANKET.

299
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,166
I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHY THEY CALL THEM THAT.

300
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,200
LOOK WHAT I GOT.

301
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,401
LOOK WHAT I GOT
FROM THE BATHROOM.

302
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:11,371
MINTS. SIX OF THEM.

303
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,973
- NICE.
- YEAH.

304
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,844
- OKAY, WHOEVER GETS
THE MOST FREE STUFF

305
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,078
BY THE END OF THE NIGHT
WINS.

306
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,280
- DEAL.

307
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,182
GO!

308
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,116
- RON, WOULD YOU
LIKE SOME SALAD?

309
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,054
- SINCE I AM NOT A RABBIT,
NO, I DO NOT.

310
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,488
- TRY IT.
SALAD'S GOOD FOR YOU.

311
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,091
- YOU GOT IT.

312
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,226
MMM, DELICIOUS.

313
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,062
- SO, CHRIS,
WHAT DO YOU DO UP HERE

314
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,063
IN YOUR SPARE TIME?

315
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,967
- WELL, UH, I EXERCISE,
AND I EXERCISE MY MIND.

316
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,235
AND I TRY TO KEEP UP
ON CURRENT EVENTS.

317
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,905
- OH, THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL IT.
- SORRY?

318
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:45,906
- HOW ARE THINGS GOING
WITH ANN?

319
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,207
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
FUNNY ABOUT ANN?

320
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,408
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND,

321
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,276
AND ANYONE WHO'D HURT HER

322
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,511
IS SOMEONE I WOULD MURDER
PROBABLY.

323
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,214
- OH, IS THAT
WHAT'S UPSETTING YOU?

324
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,315
- HMM?

325
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,917
- THIS IS VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR ME.

326
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,054
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

327
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,222
- WATCH THE MASTER WORK IT.

328
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,290
I'M THE YODA
OF NETWORKING.

329
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,926
- WELL, YODA WOULDN'T
ACTUALLY NEED NETWORKING.

330
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:06,827
I MEAN, HIS POWERS
WERE MORE SPIRITUAL.

331
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,930
- SHUT UP, YOU NERD!
- I GET IT. OKAY.

332
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,268
- MR. FEINSTEIN,
TOM HAVERFORD.

333
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,805
I'M THE ORGANIZER
OF THIS SOIREE

334
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,372
AND I'M ALSO
A HUGE FAN OF YOURS.

335
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,474
I USE ALL YOUR COLOGNE,
SOMETIMES TWO AT ONCE.

336
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:24,211
- I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT.
ARE YOU FROM THE FDA?

337
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,279
YOU KNOW, LEGALLY,
IF YOU'RE FROM THE FDA,

338
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:27,314
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

339
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,282
- I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU

340
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,518
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY CREATED
MY OWN SCENT.

341
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:35,155
- OH, GREAT. I'D LOVE
TO SMELL IT, RIGHT?

342
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,089
[laughs]

343
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,358
- I KNOW YOU'RE A BUSY GUY.
- YEAH, MAN.

344
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,426
I'M CRAZY BUSY.

345
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,462
BUT ALL DAY LONG, PEOPLE
ARE PITCHING ME COLOGNES.

346
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,798
THAT GUY JUST PITCHED ME
A COLOGNE CALLED "SLUTS."

347
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:46,133
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT I TOLD HIM.

348
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,334
NOT JUST ANYBODY
CAN DO THIS.

349
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,837
ALTHOUGH IT'S A GREAT NAME
AND I'M PROBABLY GONNA STEAL IT.

350
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,438
- PLEASE,
IT'LL TAKE TWO SECONDS.

351
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,807
IF YOU LIKE IT, MAYBE WE
GO INTO BUSINESS TOGETHER,

352
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,242
BRANCH OUT IN OTHER STATES,

353
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,210
MOVE OVER TO WATCHES
AND FANCY RAINCOATS,

354
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,445
OPEN UP STORES
IN LONDON AND PARIS.

355
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,213
I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT IT THROUGH.

356
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,381
BUT FOR NOW,

357
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:05,819
I WANT TO PRESENT
TOMMY FRESH.

358
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:09,289
- [laughs]

359
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,224
ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.

360
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,961
IT'S A GAG SCENT.
HILARIOUS.

361
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:17,197
- AS IN, "IT'S HILARIOUS
HOW AWESOME IT IS"?

362
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,031
- IT SMELLS LIKE SOMEBODY

363
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:20,367
SPILLED CHINESE FOOD
IN A BIRD CAGE.

364
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,569
HORRIBLE.
IT'S ASSAULTIVE.

365
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,605
IT TAKES EVERYTHING IN MY POWER
TO NOT RETCH RIGHT NOW.

366
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,308
KID, YOU NEED TO
FIND ANOTHER GAME.

367
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:31,278
LEAVE PERFUMERY
TO THE REAL MEN.

368
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,548
- HEY, ANN,
IF YOU GET THIS,

369
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,084
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
SHOULD COME UP HERE.

370
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,285
HE'S NOT WORTH IT, OKAY?

371
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,287
JUST CALL ME,
LET ME KNOW WHERE YOU ARE,

372
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,222
AND IF YOU HAVE--
- AAH!

373
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,356
- RON?

374
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,458
- WHAT IN
THE DEVIL'S NAME IS THIS?

375
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,927
- PORTOBELLO MUSHROOMS.

376
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,262
- WHERE'S THE STEAK?
- OH, THERE'S NO STEAK.

377
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,298
THAT'S A HEALTHIER OPTION.
IT'S ORGANICALLY GROWN.

378
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,867
- LORD.

379
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,402
- RON, ARE YOU OKAY?

380
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,403
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, OKAY.

381
00:13:56,436 --> 00:14:00,073
COULD YOU GET US
A COLD COMPRESS OR SOMETHING?

382
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:03,076
[music playing]

383
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,113
*

384
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:09,549
- HEY, UH, SIX BEERS
FOR, UH, TABLE 12.

385
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,584
- DO YOU WORK HERE?
- YEAH.

386
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,187
MY DAD OWNS THIS PLACE.
I'M JANET.

387
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,555
JANET SNAKEHOLE.

388
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,926
HEY! THIS ROUND'S
ON THE HOUSE!

389
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,393
- ALL RIGHT!
- WHOO!

390
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,661
- HOW ABOUT SOME TIPS?

391
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,464
- UH, GUM OR MINT, SIR?
- UH, GUM.

392
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,333
- ALL OUT, SIR.
- THEN MINTS, I GUESS.

393
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,001
- DON'T HAVE THOSE
EITHER, SIR.

394
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:31,972
- DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING?
- OUT OF EVERYTHING, SIR.

395
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,473
THIS IS SO AWESOME!

396
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,276
WE ARE LIKE ROBIN HOOD.

397
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:40,413
WE STEAL FROM THE CLUB
AND WE GIVE TO OURSELVES.

398
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,315
- LOOK, WE'LL FIND
A 24-HOUR DINER.

399
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,151
OR WE CAN GET
ONE OF THOSE COWS

400
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,385
THAT WE SAW
ON THE WAY UP HERE

401
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,387
AND WE'LL BRING IT BACK AND
WE'LL MAKE STEAKS OUT OF THAT.

402
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,255
[door slams]

403
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,323
- ANN PERKINS,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

404
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,359
- WHOSE PINK RAZOR
IS IN YOUR SHOWER?

405
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,493
- EXCUSE ME?

406
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,928
- LESLIE FOUND A PINK RAZOR

407
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,964
AND A PINK SWIMMING CAP
IN YOUR SHOWER.

408
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,198
WHOSE IS IT?

409
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,532
- I GUESS YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT MY RAZOR.

410
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,301
I SHAVE MY LEGS
FOR SWIMMING,

411
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,269
AND WOMEN'S RAZORS
WORK BETTER.

412
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,972
FOR WHATEVER REASON,
MEN'S RAZOR TECHNOLOGY

413
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,207
HASN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO
PROPERLY CONTOUR THE SHINBONE.

414
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,476
- AND--AND THE SWIMMING CAP?

415
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,345
- INDIANA BREAST CANCER
AWARENESS TRIATHLON 2009.

416
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,347
CAME IN FOURTH.

417
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,984
- WELL, I FOUND CONCEALER
IN YOUR MEDICINE CABINET.

418
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,085
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

419
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,220
- I'M A HUMAN BEING.

420
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,355
SOMETIMES I GET BLEMISHES.
I'M NOT PERFECT.

421
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,658
- OH, GOD.
I AM SO SORRY, HONEY.

422
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,194
I'M SO EMBARRASSED.

423
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,997
I WAS SCARED THAT YOU
WERE CHEATING ON ME.

424
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,200
- [laughs] NO, I'M NOT
CHEATING ON YOU.

425
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,136
BUT I'M ALSO
NOT DATING YOU.

426
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,671
WE BROKE UP LAST WEEK.

427
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,044
- WE TALKED AT YOUR HOUSE.

428
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,312
DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THIS?

429
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,315
- OF COURSE I REMEMBER,
BUT WE DIDN'T BREAK UP.

430
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,117
- I'M SORRY, ANN,
BUT I'M CERTAIN WE DID.

431
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,319
- OKAY, YOU SAID THAT YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE PAWNEE

432
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,122
AND THAT I WAS THE MOST AMAZING
WOMAN YOU HAD EVER MET.

433
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,489
- WHICH YOU ARE.
- AND THEN I SAID

434
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,258
THAT I WOULD MOVE TO
INDIANAPOLIS IF I HAD TO,

435
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,160
AND YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO MAKE ME DO THAT,

436
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,761
AND THEN YOU SAID
THAT IN A DIFFERENT WORLD--

437
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,298
OH, MY GOD.
YOU BROKE UP WITH ME.

438
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,167
OH, MY GOD.

439
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,536
- YEAH, SO HERE'S
WHAT HAPPENED.

440
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,572
SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL ANN
HAS NEVER BEEN DUMPED BEFORE,

441
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,507
AND CHRIS IS SUCH
A POSITIVE PERSON,

442
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,210
WHEN HE BROKE UP WITH HER,
SHE JUST DIDN'T REALIZE IT.

443
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,745
IT'S KIND OF UNDERSTANDABLE,

444
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,513
ALTHOUGH IT DOES KIND OF
MAKE YOU WONDER

445
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,782
HOW GOOD OF A NURSE SHE IS.

446
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,850
- OH, MY GOD.

447
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,352
YOU LEFT, AND YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA WORK LATE,

448
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,619
AND I KISSED YOU?

449
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,256
- AS ENJOYABLE AS THAT WAS,
I DID FIND IT ODD.

450
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,223
- [exhales]

451
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,525
AND THEN I WANTED YOU
TO MEET MY PARENTS?

452
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,461
- I'M SURE THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE,
BUT STRANGE.

453
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,762
- THIS IS HUMILIATING.

454
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,498
I'M SORRY, I GOTTA GO.

455
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,532
- HEY, W--

456
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,204
- HEY, MAN.

457
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:48,475
I, UH, GOT YOU
ANOTHER MELONTINI.

458
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,177
- THANKS.

459
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:55,215
- LISTEN, THAT GUY
IS A JERK,

460
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,650
AND IF YOU ASK ME,
HE SMELLS LIKE--

461
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,087
- SUCCESS.

462
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,456
HE SMELLS LIKE SUCCESS.

463
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,724
YOU KNOW
WHAT I SMELL LIKE?

464
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:10,263
- A TERIYAKI HAIRPIECE?

465
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:14,101
- I SMELL LIKE THE GUY
WHO'S ALWAYS COMING UP SHORT.

466
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,436
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M JUST SICK OF IT.

467
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:20,407
TOMMY FRESH WAS MY DREAM.

468
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,309
NOW NO ONE'S EVER
GONNA SMELL IT BUT ME.

469
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,145
- I CAN SMELL
YOUR DREAMS, TOM.

470
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,147
I CAN.

471
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,449
AND I CAN SMELL 'EM
FROM HERE.

472
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:33,153
AND HONESTLY, THEY SMELL
[bleep]ING TERRIBLE.

473
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:37,224
BUT I LIKE TOM.

474
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:40,793
- I'VE GOT A JAR OF OLIVES.
- HEH! NICE.

475
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,630
- A THING OF TOOTHPICKS
THAT LOOK LIKE SWORDS.

476
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,799
AND A YEAR'S SUPPLY
OF TOILET PAPER.

477
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:52,805
- I GOT--BOOM!--
$38 IN TIPS.

478
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:55,175
- $180.

479
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,280
both, in unison:
WE SHOULD GIVE IT BACK.

480
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,384
- FOLLOW ME.
- OKAY.

481
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,720
OH, MY GOD.

482
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,829
- WOW.
THANK YOU.

483
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,333
- ONE TIME,
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

484
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:24,404
A GUY'S MOM CALLED ME
AND BROKE UP WITH ME FOR HIM.

485
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,375
THERE WAS ANOTHER TIME
WHERE I WAS ON A DATE

486
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,210
AND I TRIPPED
AND BROKE MY KNEECAP.

487
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,545
AND THEN THE GUY SAID
HE WASN'T "FEELIN' IT,"

488
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:36,583
SO HE LEFT AND I WAITED
FOR AN AMBULANCE.

489
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,351
ONE TIME I WAS DATING
THIS GUY FOR A WHILE,

490
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:39,552
AND THEN HE GOT
DOWN ON ONE KNEE

491
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,221
AND HE BEGGED ME
TO NEVER CALL HIM AGAIN.

492
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,622
ONE GUY BROKE UP WITH ME

493
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,557
WHILE WE WERE IN
THE SHOWER TOGETHER.

494
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,426
SKYWRITING ISN'T ALWAYS
POSITIVE.

495
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,263
ANOTHER TIME, A GUY INVITED ME
TO A BEAUTIFUL PICNIC

496
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,498
WITH WINE AND FLOWERS,

497
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:52,799
AND THEN,
WHEN I TRIED TO SIT DOWN,

498
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:55,802
HE SAID, "DON'T EAT ANYTHING.
REBECCA'S COMING."

499
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,337
AND THEN
HE BROKE UP WITH ME.

500
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,471
[both laugh]

501
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,408
- WHO WAS REBECCA?
- YEAH. EXACTLY.

502
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,477
- THANKS FOR DRIVING ME.

503
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,678
WAIT.

504
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:06,679
YOU'RE GETTING

505
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:07,647
AT THE STATEHOUSE.

506
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,417
- OH, PLEASE.
IT'S JUST A GOOFY CEREMONY.

507
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,418
I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT IT.

508
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,452

512
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,727
- [sighs]

513
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,862
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

514
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,736
- THIS ISN'T A STEAK.

515
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,204
WHY WOULD YOU CALL IT THAT
ON YOUR MENU?

516
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:32,605
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO TELL YOU, MAN.

517
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,945
- JUST GIVE ME ALL THE BACON
AND EGGS YOU HAVE.

518
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,413
WAIT, WAIT.

519
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,848
I WORRY
WHAT YOU JUST HEARD WAS,

520
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,751
"GIVE ME A LOT
OF BACON AND EGGS."

521
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,353
WHAT I SAID WAS,

522
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:50,290
GIVE ME ALL THE BACON
AND EGGS YOU HAVE.

523
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,758
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

524
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,397
- IT'S CALLED
A TOMMYTINI.

525
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,932
IT'S JUST VODKA
AND A BUNCH OF CINNAMON.

526
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,801
- THAT SOUNDS GROSS.

527
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,736
- BEN.

00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,705
HOW'D YOU KNOW?
- EVERYBODY KNOWS.

A CRAPPY MOOD

540
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:25,925
BECAUSE CHRIS DUMPED HER.

- AH, YEAH,
LIKE A WEEK AGO, RIGHT?

542
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:32,799
- YEAH, BUT I ONLY KNEW ABOUT IT
AN HOUR AGO.

543
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,934
- OH, SO THAT'S WHY
YOU TRIED TO KISS HIM.

544
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,737
WE WERE ALL SERIOUSLY
CONFUSED ABOUT THAT.

545
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,473
- WHO'S "WE"?
WHAT ARE YOU--? OH, GOD.

546
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,012

554
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:06,633

555
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,735

556
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,003
