1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,336
Good morning, Ron.
Morning.

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,203
I know how much you enjoy paperwork,
but don't hover.

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,001
Nice bench.
Is that new?

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,408
No, that's been there
since the '90s.

5
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,207
What are you doing for
your birthday on Friday?

6
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,078
Nothing. I never...

7
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,012
Aha!

8
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,109
Oh, God.

9
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,881
<i>Birthday,</i>
<i>birthday, birthday</i>

10
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,889
<i>It's your birthday</i>

11
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,822
<i>It's your birthday,</i>
<i>and I know when it is</i>

12
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,918
Ron refuses to tell anyone
when his birthday is.

13
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,260
He's even had it redacted
on all government documents.

14
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,096
Three years of investigations,
phone calls,

15
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,399
Freedom of Information Act requests,
and still, I had nothing,

16
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:43,738
until a well-placed bribe to a
gentleman at Baskin-Robbins revealed

17
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,844
Ron's birthday is on Friday.

18
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,710
Damn it. I was so careful.

19
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:49,840
Well, you blew it.

20
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,111
All for a free scoop
of Rum Raisin.

21
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,483
Was it worth it,
Ron? Was it?

22
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,681
I command you
to do nothing.

23
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,383
I'm not gonna do nothing.
I'm gonna do something.

24
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,618
And it's gonna
be really big.

25
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,126
I have a lot of years
to make up for.

26
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,358
I don't like loud noises
and people making a fuss,

27
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,992
and I especially don't like
people celebrating

28
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,027
because they know a piece of
private information about me.

29
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,297
Plus, the whole thing
is a scam.

30
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:18,105
Birthdays were invented
by Hallmark to sell cards.

31
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,797
They put up a fence.

32
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,527
Who?

33
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,393
No!
What's that?

34
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,497
There's a small park on the line
between Pawnee and Eagleton, and...

35
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,873
Last night Eagleton put up
a fence around their side

36
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,811
to keep us disgusting Pawnee
hobos off their precious land.

37
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,546
There's even a security guard.
You got to show Eagleton I.D. to get in.

38
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,585
Eagleton is a bunch
of rich snobs.

39
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,813
And that's coming from
someone who has a Mercedes.

40
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,823
With a Harman Kardon Logic
7 surround-sound system.

41
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,086
Who builds a fence to keep
kids out of a playground?

42
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,594
Three words,
Lindsay Carlisle Shay.

43
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,156
Who?

44
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,031
Lindsay Carlisle Shay and I
used to be best friends.

45
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,833
We worked together at the
Pawnee Parks Department.

46
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,931
Then she went to work
in Eagleton

47
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:27,844
and "fixed her deviated septum" and
lost 35 pounds and lost something else.

48
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,108
What was it again?

49
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,843
Oh, yeah. Her soul.

50
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,886
Is the Eagleton side really that
much better than the Pawnee side?

51
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,352
To be fair, yeah.

52
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,514
Our side is this scrappy
piece of land

53
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,184
where kids go to smash
fluorescent light tubes.

54
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,557
But it has a lot of heart.

55
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,858
That's what people always
say when something sucks.

56
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,454
We should stand up
for our town, okay?

57
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,194
Pawneeans are just
as good as Eagletonians,

58
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,668
although on average,
we are several inches shorter

59
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,136
and 80 pounds heavier.

60
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,969
People in Eagleton
are straight up mean to us.

61
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,702
I would never set foot
over there.

62
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,542
But it's the only place that I can get
my Bumble and Bumble hair care products,

63
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,410
so I'm there
every eight days.

64
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,916
Okay, well, I am on
"Operation No More Fence,"

65
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:08,385
so I'm putting you in charge of "Operation
Ron's Party, colon, Shock And Awe."

66
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,648
I am all over it.

67
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,587
I just need you to do
what's on that list.

68
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,923
Leslie has a lot of qualities
I find horrifying.

69
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,431
But the worst one by far
is how thoughtful she can be.

70
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,830
It's the only park
in our neighborhood.

71
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,664
I mean, where are my kids
supposed to play, the rock quarry?

72
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:24,862
There's rocks in there.

73
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,599
Why don't we just set fire to the fence?
You know, set it ablaze.

74
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,242
That's arson.

75
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,336
Well, let's leave that up to the
lawyers. The point is, it would work.

76
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,780
Why don't we build a fence
around their fence?

77
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,410
Why?
It would give us two fences,

78
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:44,648
so if they needed to get to their
fence for maintenance and whatnot,

79
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,282
their pants might get caught.

80
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,420
My son Joey tried to scale that
fence to play on the Eagleton side,

81
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,361
and he fell
and hurt his arm.

82
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,626
You need to get those people
to tear that fence down.

83
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,861
This woman's right.

84
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:59,530
I promise you,
citizens of Pawnee,

85
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,369
and sweet, brave Joey,

86
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,568
I will tear down
that fence.

87
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:08,041
Okay, I'm just gonna suggest one
more time that we burn it down.

88
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,877
But whatever
you guys think.

89
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,382
Yeah. Great.

90
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,748
Yes, hi.

91
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,016
I have a question about
your inflatable saxophones.

92
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,656
Do those come
in different sizes?

93
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,784
I'm gonna need
about 40 dozen of those.

94
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,954
Also, what about your
neon gangster fedora hats?

95
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,290
That was rude.

96
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,459
Whatever's going on here,
stop it immediately.

97
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,626
I was just talking
on the phone.

98
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,397
To whom?
It was personal.

99
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,701
I would never make a work-related call.
You know that.

100
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,011
Lindsay!
Leslie Knope.

101
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,137
Hi.
Hi.

102
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,412
Has it really been
five years?

103
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,418
It has.
You look amazing.

104
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:50,752
Thank you. This place hasn't changed
a bit. Still loveable, but grimy.

105
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,986
Hello, there. I'm Ben Wyatt.
I'm assistant city manager...

106
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,118
Hi, Dan.

107
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,320
Ben.
It's not important.

108
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,557
It won't come up again.

109
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,191
This is Ann.
She is my best friend.

110
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,529
Hi.
Now.

111
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,866
And she's a nurse,
and she works at a hospital.

112
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:05,926
Oh.

113
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,041
Nice to meet you. I'm sorry.
It's just, nursing...

114
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,599
You must be
so tired and sad.

115
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,977
It's really nice outside.
Shall we speak in my courtyard?

116
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,481
Yeah.

117
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,783
Well, thank you so much
for stopping by.

118
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,649
I was passing through
Pawnee anyway.

119
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,586
I do a lot of charity
work here.

120
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,521
There's only so much
you can do.

121
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,459
You know, I found a picture
of you from back in the day.

122
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,654
Oh.

123
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,959
Look at that.

124
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,465
Let me get a closer look.

125
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,660
So let's talk
about Lafayette Park.

126
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,603
Oh, yes. The fence.

127
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,872
I'm only trying
to protect our children.

128
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,739
Come on, Lindsay,
this isn't you.

129
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,673
When we used to work
here together,

130
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,839
we loved the fact
that parks were for everyone.

131
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,212
That's what makes
them so great.

132
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,511
You know what's
really great?

133
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,109
A private park
that's not for everyone.

134
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,178
Wowsers.
What do you care?

135
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,779
It's just a crappy
little park.

136
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,347
Well, someone
once told me

137
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,450
that there's no such thing
as small parks,

138
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,516
just small ideas.

139
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,584
Hmm.

140
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,288
And that someone

141
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,889
was this woman.

142
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:11,094
You can take it if you want.
I have many copies and the negatives.

143
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,296
And I have a JPEG.

144
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,435
The fence stays up.

145
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,474
Lindsay, if we...
Sweetie,

146
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,237
and I mean this
in the nicest possible way,

147
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,144
Pawnee is and always will be
a dirty, little nightmare

148
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,307
from which you will
never wake up.

149
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,742
But it was good
seeing you.

150
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,651
What? I'm not asleep.
I'm awake.

151
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,351
I'm wide awake,
and I got my eyes on you.

152
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,328
That's what I would've said if I
had thought of it in the moment.

153
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,689
What did I say instead?

154
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,362
Wow! This is where
they have their public forums?

155
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,835
Yeah, it's not
that great.

156
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,202
They had a valet.

157
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,207
Yes, Eagleton is
nicer than Pawnee.

158
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,767
And, yes, because of their cupcake factory,
the air always smells like vanilla.

159
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,479
Oh, yeah.
Wow.

160
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,715
But their people are not
inherently better than our people.

161
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,777
The only thing they beat us in is
life expectancy, beauty pageants,

162
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,515
and average income.
Who cares?

163
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,817
Factoid alert.

164
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,189
Eagleton was founded
by former Pawneeans.

165
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,456
Pawnee was established
in May of 1817.

166
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,827
And by July,

167
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,526
finding the smell unpleasant
and the soil untenable,

168
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,728
all the wealthy people
evacuated to Eagleton.

169
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,670
Hello, Pawnee.

170
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,335
Welcome to our public forum.

171
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,570
Hi, I'm Thomas
Montgomery Haverford.

172
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,977
Okay.
Well, nice outfit.

173
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,480
What, did you just come
from the stables?

174
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,643
Yes. I was just
at the stables.

175
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,743
You look like
you've been working hard.

176
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,686
You have a million
fly-aways right now.

177
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,951
Would you like to borrow
a mirror or a self-help book?

178
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,014
I would not.

179
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,151
I would like you to get off
your high horse, Lindsay.

180
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,422
Pun intended.

181
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,397
You know if I had your job,
there would be no fence there.

182
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,991
Well, you don't have my job because
you knew you couldn't handle it.

183
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,659
The forum is beginning.

184
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,705
We've got a little bit
of Eagleton business,

185
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,798
and then I'll introduce you.
Great.

186
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,900
Look how pretty
the people are.

187
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,039
Hey, Ron.

188
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,477
How's the street parking
at your house?

189
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,536
What?

190
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,584
Can you handle, like, 20 cars
or a double-decker party bus?

191
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,746
There is no street parking
at my house.

192
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,288
My house is not even
on a street.

193
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,792
Do you have space
for, like, a huge circus tent?

194
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,263
Hey, Ron. Have you seen...
What the hell?

195
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
No!

196
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,323
Oh!

197
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,392
Well, looks like there won't be
any balloons for the birthday boy.

198
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,995
These were for a sick child
at the hospital.

199
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,169
My office, now.

200
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,403
I don't work for you.
Don't care.

201
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,477
Decisions, decisions.

202
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,743
I think I'm gonna go with the porcini
mushrooms and boursin, <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

203
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,685
<i>...that the Eagleton-Pawnee fence</i>
<i>does a lot more harm than it does good.</i>

204
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,549
Hello. I'm Bertram Rolands,
a citizen of Eagleton.

205
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,190
With all due respect,
Ms. Knope,

206
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,857
can't you just clean up
your side of the park,

207
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,092
put some new equipment there?

208
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,394
<i>Well, we would love</i>
<i>to do that,</i>

209
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,403
<i>but, unfortunately,</i>
<i>money is tight right now.</i>

210
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,504
Hello. I'm Christine Porter.

211
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,179
I want to respectfully say
that I'm in favor of the fence.

212
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:10,147
I see it as a kind
of punishment for Pawnee

213
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,413
that might inspire your
town to clean up its act.

214
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,112
<i>Well, I would like</i>
<i>to respectfully say</i>

215
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,181
<i>that any child should be able</i>
<i>to play in any park,</i>

216
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,693
<i>regardless of wealth</i>
<i>or status.</i>

217
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,996
<i>Anyway, this is</i>
<i>Joey Plunkett.</i>

218
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,764
<i>Joey, wave to the audience.</i>

219
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,533
<i>Oh, you can't, because</i>
<i>you broke your arm</i>

220
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,136
<i>climbing that fence.</i>

221
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,540
I can wave with this arm.
<i>No, you can't.</i>

222
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,740
<i>Both your arms are broken.</i>

223
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,576
All due respect,
I recognize that boy.

224
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,811
He was caught selling
fireworks to Eagleton kids.

225
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,311
<i>Well, with more due respect,</i>

226
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,584
<i>a lot of boys do that in our town.</i>
<i>You cannot be sure that he is the one.</i>

227
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:55,024
This is a perfect example of
how we're going to help you.

228
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,426
Here's to you, Joey,
and your mother

229
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:01,227
and to every Pawnee citizen
who might have a bright future

230
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,394
if they fundamentally change
everything about themselves.

231
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,096
Thanks to Leslie Knope.
<i>I'm not done.</i>

232
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,368
Isn't she trying
her hardest?

233
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:15,043
So cute and so good.

234
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,207
I'm only gonna ask
you this once.

235
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,875
What is going on
with my birthday?

236
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,976
Oh, my God. Ron,
it's your birthday.

237
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,283
Happy Birthday.
Shut your damn mouth.

238
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,914
This is a fun conversation.

239
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,016
Just tell me what
Leslie is planning.

240
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,085
Honestly, I don't know.
I haven't heard anything.

241
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,630
Why don't you tell me what she
did for your last birthday?

242
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,598
Oh, well,
that was intense.

243
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,191
She totally surprised me.

244
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,735
She kidnapped me
from work,

245
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,737
and then she took me
to that place, Señor Vega's,

246
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,432
you know, where
the mariachi band comes out.

247
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,442
They put a big sombrero on you, and
then everybody sings "Happy Birthday"?

248
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,568
Damn it.

249
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,907
And then we went
back to my house,

250
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,607
and she invited
basically everyone I knew,

251
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,242
and she had this great guy
doing face painting,

252
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,752
and I had my face painted
like a fairy tiger.

253
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,048
Ugh.

254
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,917
Also, she did it, like,
a week before my birthday,

255
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,481
which is genius,
'cause I had no idea it was coming.

256
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,959
And then there was
a bouncy castle.

257
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,190
Did you know they made
those for adults?

258
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,253
Mmm-hmm.

259
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,633
Maybe I'll change it up this time.
Can I try the andouille sausage?

260
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,499
Tom, let's go.
What? No.

261
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,373
Hey, not you too.

262
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,740
It's gross. I don't like it.
It's disgusting.

263
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,811
Did you guys get
your public forum gift bag?

264
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,472
There's an iPod touch in here.

265
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,712
Man, she used to not be like this.
Eagleton really changed her.

266
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,583
Yeah, what exactly happened
between the two of you, anyway?

267
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,179
Five years ago, Eagleton
offered me that job.

268
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,521
And you said no?
Are you insane?

269
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,617
I talked it over with Lindsay,
and we made a pact

270
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,720
that we would stay
in Pawnee together

271
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:42,124
and work hard and fight to make
Pawnee a better place to live.

272
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,568
And then they offered her the job,
and she took it and disappeared.

273
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,663
Wow.

274
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,732
Verbena-scented soy candles!

275
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,207
You want me
to do what, now?

276
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,341
Send Leslie somewhere on an assignment,
a conference or something,

277
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,511
and make her take April and
freeze their bank accounts.

278
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,384
I don't understand.
Is Leslie's work unsatisfactory?

279
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,322
No, it has nothing to do
with her work.

280
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,549
I don't want
to get into it.

281
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,158
Ron, look,
this is me, okay?

282
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,555
You know you can talk
to me about anything.

283
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:17,363
Well, it's my birthday
on Friday.

284
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,700
Hey! Happy Birthday.

285
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,537
I'm ending this right now.
I'm just gonna leave early and go home.

286
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,708
Unless...

287
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,012
That's exactly what
she wants me to do.

288
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,652
All right, everybody
just grab a bag and open it up

289
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,286
and then try to find
some dirty stuff in there.

290
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,382
What are you doing?

291
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,121
Eagleton treats us like garbage.
We're gonna treat them like garbage.

292
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,753
We're gonna take
these bags of trash,

293
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,559
and we're gonna throw it over
to their side of the park.

294
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,658
And then we're just gonna let the
stink and the raccoons run wild.

295
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,536
Well, isn't that just playing
right into what they think of you?

296
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,171
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
Let's just stop this.

297
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,668
Put everything
back in the truck.

298
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,337
Let's back it up.
No, no, no, no.

299
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,381
Leslie, you promised we could
throw garbage everywhere.

300
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,909
Wow.

301
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,919
I didn't expect to see the
whole Parks Department here,

302
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,286
although it is, sadly,
one of the nicest spots in town.

303
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,325
I am so sick
of this, Lindsay.

304
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,553
Wait, Leslie.
I've got this.

305
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,791
You listen to me,
Lindsay Carlisle Shay.

306
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,525
Why don't you take
your fancy dog,

307
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,930
get in your Escalade,

308
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,866
and if you have
any job openings,

309
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,164
maybe you should let
me know about 'em.

310
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,864
Come on, man.
No!

311
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,772
I'm sick of
being treated

312
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,709
like I'm not willing to relocate
to Eagleton, because I am!

313
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,577
So here's what
you could do, lady.

314
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,705
Take this resume

315
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,684
and shove it into
your human resources slot.

316
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,486
Oh, yeah!
Shove it there!

317
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,546
No.

318
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:49,787
You might have a fancy car
and a mahogany purse,

319
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,261
or whatever rich people have,

320
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,628
but I remember something
that you're trying to forget.

321
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,564
You're a Pawnee girl.

322
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,434
No, Leslie, I'm not.

323
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,869
Well, then why do you
come here at dinnertime

324
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,100
and get takeout from the
legendary J.J.'s Diner?

325
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,037
It's not for me.

326
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,004
These waffles make
great dog laxatives.

327
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,637
Don't you dare

328
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,849
feed that waffle to that dog
to get it to poop.

329
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,883
Sambuca need to make?

330
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,285
There you go.

331
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,387
Leslie.
How dare you?

332
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,856
No!
- Get her, Leslie!

333
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,722
No!

334
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,660
Garbage fight!

335
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,720
Ugh!

336
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:31,417
I want her arrested for
attempted murder.

337
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,781
For God's sake, Knope.
Get a grip.

338
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:34,799
Thank God you're here!

339
00:14:34,884 --> 00:14:36,451
I want her arrested!

340
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,836
She attacked me,

341
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,255
and then she hurled my
Kate Spade headband somewhere.

342
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:42,173
I think my Eagleton
colleagues would agree

343
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:43,791
that we don't want to make
a federal case out of this,

344
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:45,694
so I suggest you both apologize
to each other,

345
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,762
and we pretend
this never happened.

346
00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:49,648
I will never apologize to her.

347
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:51,700
- Nor I her.
- "Nor I her."

348
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:54,903
I doth proclaim to be
a stupid fartface.

349
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:57,322
Nice retort. Did G.B. Shaw
write that for you?

350
00:14:57,406 --> 00:14:59,157
Did G.B. Shaw write
your stupid fartface?

351
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:01,159
Ladies, if you don't apologize,

352
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:03,311
we're gonna have to toss
the both of you in jail.

353
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:06,848
So just swallow your pride...

354
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,217
Say you're sorry.

355
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:17,842
We hope you enjoy
your evening here

356
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:19,260
at the Eagleton holding cell.

357
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:22,146
Can I offer you anything...
herbal tea, Greek yogurt?

358
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:23,414
No.

359
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:28,269
Morning, Ron.

360
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:31,522
Ooh, dude, you forgot
to put a shirt on.

361
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,824
I do it all the time.
It's fine.

362
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,143
- I slept here.
- Sweet.

363
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:38,763
So a little birdie told me
it's your birthday coming up.

364
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:40,231
How about
a free birthday shoe shine?

365
00:15:40,282 --> 00:15:41,899
What did this
little birdie tell you

366
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,135
is going to happen
for my birthday?

367
00:15:44,203 --> 00:15:46,271
Oh, nice try, Ron. You're not
getting anything out of me.

368
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:47,839
Andrew, please.

369
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:51,576
Ron, look,
I love you like a father

370
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:53,578
who's not that much
older than me...

371
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:54,779
like a young Uncle...

372
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:57,048
or like, uh, you were
my camp counselor,

373
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:58,916
but we're adults,
so we hang out,

374
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:00,184
and it's not weird, you know.

375
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:01,803
Or, actually,
here's what it is.

376
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:03,988
You're my Lacrosse coach.
I get it. I get it.

377
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:05,223
What's the point?

378
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,292
Well, coach,

379
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:09,677
Leslie swore me to secrecy,
so I can't say anything.

380
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:11,679
I owe her so much.
I can't ruin it for her.

381
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:15,433
- Well, I respect that.
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:16,684
- See you later.
- Okay...

383
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:19,604
Not if I see you first,
Uncle Ron.

384
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:21,272
And I probably will,

385
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:25,076
'cause Leslie assigned me
to the kidnap squad.

386
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:29,681
Hey, jailbird.

387
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:32,667
Beautiful Ann, thank you
for coming to get me.

388
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:34,035
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

389
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,653
Are you okay?

390
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:39,340
It was a rough night,
but I survived.

391
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:41,158
Scone?

392
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,796
- They only have maple walnut.
- Yeah. Thank you.

393
00:16:44,863 --> 00:16:47,065
Why did you get arrested?
What did you do?

394
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,834
The only thing I'm guilty of
is loving Pawnee...

395
00:16:49,902 --> 00:16:51,803
And punching Lindsay
in the face

396
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,022
and shoving a coffee filter
down her pants.

397
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:56,808
But in my defense, I believe
that assault should be legal

398
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,142
if a person is a jerk.

399
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,228
Why are you letting her
get to you like this?

400
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,680
Because she's a stupid jerk...

401
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:04,382
Because we were best friends

402
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,651
and then she sold out
everything that we believed in.

403
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:07,785
And the worst part?

404
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:09,287
To her, our friendship...

405
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:10,722
it's like it never happened.

406
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:13,124
Well, first of all,
this color looks amazing on you.

407
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:14,325
Thank you.

408
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:16,060
Second of all,
the whole fence thing...

409
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:18,129
she's obviously trying
to get a rise out of you.

410
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:20,998
Third of all, she knows
she only got the job

411
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:23,167
because you turned it down,
which must drive her nuts.

412
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:26,254
But most importantly,
you say the word,

413
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,474
and I will beat her senseless
with a baseball bat.

414
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,642
Thank you.

415
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,911
Wait a minute.

416
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:35,763
Oh, my God. Okay, we have
a lot of work to do.

417
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:38,082
Ann, put these scones
in your bra.

418
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,267
- Let's go.
- Okay.

419
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,219
Can we just stop off
at the, um, lobby?

420
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,638
'Cause the prison gift bags
are amazing.

421
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:45,189
Hey, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter.

422
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:46,858
Hey, batter, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter, batter.

423
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:47,975
Hey, batter, bah.

424
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:51,996
Lucas with a crazy base hit!

425
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:54,098
Dude, stop rooting
for the other team.

426
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:56,451
You're just mad 'cause
they are lighting you up.

427
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,669
- What's going on here?
- Hi, Lindsay.

428
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:00,872
Introducing the Pawnee
wiffle ball league.

429
00:18:00,939 --> 00:18:02,407
It's an idea
that I came up with

430
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,875
after my best friend, Ann,
over there

431
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:05,827
said she wanted to bash your
head in with a baseball bat.

432
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:07,995
And I want to thank you
for the fence.

433
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,048
There's no way we could afford
that high-quality wood.

434
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:12,583
What if someone
hits a home run?

435
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,001
How will you get the ball back?

436
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:16,187
One of the many
Eagleton kids who signed up

437
00:18:16,255 --> 00:18:19,841
will just pop over and grab it.

438
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,342
Hey, what are you doing
tonight?

439
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:23,177
- Why?
- I don't know.

440
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:25,463
I thought maybe you could bust
out your old jazz sweatshirt,

441
00:18:25,514 --> 00:18:27,899
and you and I could go
to Sullivan's for a beer.

442
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:30,184
Yeah, I do still have
that sweatshirt.

443
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:31,502
I know you do.

444
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,571
Foul ball!

445
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:36,073
- You did all this in a day?
- Yeah.

446
00:18:36,141 --> 00:18:37,241
All right.

447
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:38,693
I work with some
really great people.

448
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,115
Good job, guys.
Great job.

449
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,535
Hey, did you hear the news?

450
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:50,455
Ben and Chris want us to go
into Conference Room "C"

451
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:51,522
for a meeting.

452
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,208
Let's get this over with.

453
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:05,203
Happy Birthday, Ron.

454
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,438
Ann said you had a big party...

455
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:09,173
sombreros, karaoke.

456
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,575
Yeah, I did that for Ann.

457
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:13,511
Why would I throw Ron Swanson
an Ann Perkins party?

458
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:16,680
What about the giant list
of things April was doing?

459
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:18,950
That was just a list
of ways to mess with you.

460
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:21,686
- She do 'em all?
- She did indeed.

461
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:26,657
So I have rented
<i>Bridge on the River Kwai</i>

462
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,792
and <i>The Dirty Dozen.</i>

463
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,962
Artie from security
is outside the door,

464
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:32,663
so no one will bother you.

465
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:34,999
And a cab will be here
whenever you're ready

466
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:36,334
to take you home.

467
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:39,637
Thank you.

468
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:42,673
Do you remember what you
said to me five years ago

469
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:44,308
when Eagleton offered me
that job,

470
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:45,943
and I asked you
for your advice?

471
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:47,945
Uh, "do whatever
the hell you want.

472
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:48,980
What do I care?"

473
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:50,848
Right, but then, after,

474
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,150
when I pressed you,
what did you say?

475
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:55,486
I believe I said

476
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:57,438
that I thought
we worked well together

477
00:19:57,523 --> 00:20:00,892
and that I might disagree
with your philosophy,

478
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,894
but I respected you.

479
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:04,428
And I said that you'll get

480
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:07,198
a lot of job offers
in your life,

481
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:09,267
but you only have one hometown.

482
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,801
Yes.

483
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:13,271
That's how I remember it.

484
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:19,410
This, by the way,
is a one-time-only situation.

485
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:22,813
Next year, your birthday party
is gonna be a rager.

486
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:30,469
Mmm!

487
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,594
Mmm.
