1
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:04,372
- RON? JACK COOPER
FROM THE CONTROLLER'S OFFICE.

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:05,606
GOT A--
GOT A SECOND?

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,408
- SURE, WHAT CAN I
DO YOU FOR?

4
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,809
- FRANKLY, THIS IS
A LITTLE AWKWARD.

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,412
WE'VE RECEIVED THIS LETTER
FROM A COLLECTION AGENCY

6
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:12,746
ABOUT AN OUTSTANDING DEBT

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,083
FROM THE PAWNEE
PUBLIC LIBRARY.

8
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,117
IT APPEARS
YOU HAVE AN OVERDUE BOOK.

9
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,518
- OH, DO I?

10
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,620
- IT'S NOT
THE SIZE OF THE BOAT:

11
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:23,591
EMBRACING LIFE
WITH A MICRO-PENIS.

12
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,293
- TAMMY.

13
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,295
MY EX-WIFE TAMMY
LIKES TO CHECK IN

14
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:29,197
EVERY SO OFTEN
AND MAKE SURE

15
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,698
I'M DOING OKAY.

16
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:34,568
AND IF I AM, SHE TRIES
TO [bleep] EVERYTHING UP.

17
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,504
- OKAY, I PRE-DIALED 911,
SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

18
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,571
IS PRESS SEND.

19
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:38,772
- YOU'RE WORRYING
OVER NOTHING.

20
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:40,641
- IF SHE BINDS YOUR HANDS
AND YOU CAN'T REACH YOUR PHONE,

21
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,476
JUST TRY TO
CHEW YOURSELF FREE.

22
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,847
WHALE TALE.
WHALE TALE.

23
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,716
SHE'S FLASHING A WHALE TALE.
ABORT. ABORT.

24
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,085
- HELLO, TAMMY.

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,853
- OH.
HELLO, RON.

26
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,855
I DIDN'T SEE YOU COME IN.

27
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,091
I WAS JUST CHECKING MYSELF
FOR SCOLIOSIS.

28
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,227
- AND?
- STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW.

29
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,096
JUST LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE
I KNOW.

30
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:02,730
JERKY?

31
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,798
- CALL OFF THE DOGS.

32
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,267
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

33
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,868
THAT IN MY ENTIRE
ADULT LIFE,

34
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,605
I HAVE NEVER CHECKED
A BOOK OUT OF THE LIBRARY.

35
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,774
- OH, MY GOD,
SHE'S AMAZING.

36
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,744
- OOH...
MMM.

37
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:19,313
- I ADMIT THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOR

38
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:21,449
WOULD'VE DRIVEN ME WILD.

39
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:24,452
BUT I AM IN A HEALTHY
RELATIONSHIP NOW, TAMMY.

40
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:27,388
- A RELATIONSHIP?
WITH WHOM?

41
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,490
- A LOVELY, INTELLIGENT,
SELF-POSSESSED

42
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:30,858
PEDIATRIC SURGEON
NAMED WENDY.

43
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,361
- SOUNDS LIKE A REAL WHORE.

44
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,763
- CLEAR THE LATE CHARGES
AND CUT THE CRAP.

45
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,766
GOOD DAY.

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,434
- GOOD DAY, LESLIE.

47
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:43,337
- GOOD--GOOD DAY.

48
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:46,340
[triumphant music]

49
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:54,382
*

50
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,692
- OKAY, SO WE'RE
ORDERING THEM

51
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,561
A TOTAL OF 30 PIZZAS
SO LET'S TALK TOPPINGS.

52
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:08,829
- SAUSAGE, ONION,
AND PEPPERS.

53
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,265
SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN
TO BE THE BEST TOPPINGS.

54
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:12,566
- NICE.

55
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,168
- SHOULD WE THROW IN
SOME SALADS

56
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:15,836
FOR A HEALTHY OPTION?

57
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,439
- WOW, DON'T BE
SUCH A JERRY, BEN.

58
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,374
- YEAH, BEN, THESE GUYS
ARE COPS, NOT BALLERINAS.

59
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:21,842
SO WE ARE THROWING
A LITTLE SHINDIG

60
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,378
FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING THEM

61
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:26,814
TO VOLUNTEER AS SECURITY
DURING THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

62
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,683
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
ABOUT BIG OUTDOOR GATHERINGS

63
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,353
THAT MAKES EVERYONE
WANT TO URINATE

64
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:36,357
ALL OVER EVERYTHING,
BUT IT DOES.

65
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,858
AND THEY DO.

66
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,828
- OKAY,
HOW ABOUT SOME CALZONES?

67
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,830
- CALZONES ARE LIKE PIZZAS
BUT THEY'RE HARDER TO EAT.

68
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,566
THEY'RE DUMB
AND SO WAS THAT IDEA.

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,902
- SERIOUSLY?
- THIS IS EMBARRASSING FOR YOU.

70
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,904
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
RON, YOU READY?

71
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,540
- ABSOLUTELY, MY DEAR.

72
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,508
I AM OFF TO HAVE
A MID-MORNING PRE-LUNCH

73
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:55,776
WITH MY LADY FRIEND,

74
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,745
BUT I WILL BE BACK
IN TIME FOR LUNCH.

75
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,214
- ALL RIGHT.

76
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:01,615
- OH, RON'S GIRLFRIEND'S
PRETTY.

77
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:04,852
- [laughs]

78
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,287
TOM'S EX-WIFE.

79
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,822
- OH.

80
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,291
- I DON'T WANT TO
SEE THEM TOGETHER.

81
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,659
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
RUBBING IT IN MY FACE.

82
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,927
SO ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS CAPTAIN MUSTACHE

83
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,396
PLOWING MY EX-WIFE.

84
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,530
- AND YOU IMAGINE
HE'S WEARING A CAPE

85
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:17,898
WHILE HE'S PLOWING HER?

86
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,467
- WHAT?

87
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,734
- NO, JUST,
CAPTAIN MUSTACHE?

88
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,803
I MEAN, IF ALL YOU CAN THINK OF
IS RON, YOU KNOW--[grunting]--

89
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,672
MAYBE PUT HIM IN SOME TIGHTS
AND A CAPE

90
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,839
AND THEN--AND THEN
IT WOULD BE FUNNY.

91
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:30,411
- NOW, I'M IMAGINING
A CAPE.

92
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,612
- APRIL?

93
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,615
- DID YOU CALL ME?

94
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,250
- I DID CALL YOU.
GOOD EARS.

95
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:39,753
- CHRIS'S ASSISTANT
WENT BACK TO INDIANAPOLIS,

96
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:43,424
SO HE'S BORROWING ME
FOR A FEW DAYS.

97
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,758
YAY.

98
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,594
- I'D LIKE YOU TO GET ME
SOME MORE POST-ITS.

99
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,028
I'D LIKE THEM
IN MULTIPLE COLORS.

100
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,663
I'D LIKE GREEN.
I'D LIKE YELLOW.

101
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,632
DO NOT BUY ORANGE.

102
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,567
I DO NOT WANT ORANGE.
I HAVE PLENTY OF ORANGE.

103
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:54,902
- GOT IT.

104
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,804
YOU WANT FIVE MILLION
ORANGE POST-ITS.

105
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,807
- THAT'S HILARIOUS.

106
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,479
OH, WAIT!
I HAVE A POST-IT FOR YOU.

107
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,915
IT SAYS, "GREAT JOB."
- MMM.

108
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,750
- GREAT JOB!
- MMM.

109
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,785
- THERE YOU GO.

110
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:17,858
- THEY'RE GETTING REALLY OLD
AND I'M AN ONLY CHILD.

111
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,960
I JUST FEEL LIKE
THE RIGHT THING TO DO

112
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,364
IS TO MOVE BACK HOME.

113
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,733
- I'M SORRY TO SEE YOU GO.

114
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:30,804
I'VE REALLY COME TO THINK
OF YOU AS...

115
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:34,442
A COMPANION.

116
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:38,746
- HEY, I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'D WANT TO MOVE TO CANADA?

117
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,913
- [chokes, spits]

118
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,815
[laughs]

119
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,418
CANADA.

120
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:47,855
NO, I DON'T SUPPOSE I WOULD.

121
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,857
- HEY, I HATE TO NAG,

122
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,091
BUT SHOULDN'T
WE BE TALKING STRATEGY,

123
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,629
LIKE, WHEN TO ASK THE CHIEF
FOR THIS HUGE CRITICAL FAVOR?

124
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,498
- YES. I KNOW EXACTLY
WHEN WE SHOULD DO IT.

125
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,433
POST PIZZA,
PRE ICE CREAM,

126
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:00,834
BETWEEN HIS THIRD
AND FOURTH BEER.

127
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,870
HE'LL BE FULL BUT NOT STUFFED,
TIPSY BUT NOT DRUNK.

128
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:03,804
SHOULD BE AROUND 9:00.

129
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,106
- OKAY, SO YOU'VE
THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.

130
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,843
- JUST SIT TIGHT.
I'LL GET YOU A BEER.

131
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,813
CAN I HAVE
TWO BEERS PLEASE?

132
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:13,914
HEY, YOU OKAY?

133
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,849
- WENDY AND I ARE OVER.

134
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,885
SHE'S MOVING BACK
TO CANADA.

135
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,720
IT'S TOO BAD.

136
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,356
I JUST TAUGHT HER
HOW TO WHITTLE.

137
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,793
SHE MADE ME THIS
TINY SHARPENED STICK.

138
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,529
- LOOK, I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT I TELL ALL MY GIRLFRIENDS

139
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,464
WHEN THEY GET DUMPED.

140
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:31,832
MEN ARE DOGS.

141
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,767
- THANK YOU, LESLIE.

142
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,870
THAT DOES NOT APPLY
TO THIS SITUATION AT ALL.

143
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,039
BUT THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.

144
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,774
- THIS IS A DISASTER.

145
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,644
YOU'RE NOT INTO FOOTBALL?

146
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,046
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOU.

147
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,582
I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT, KNEW IT, KNEW IT.

148
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,784
- HONESTLY, I HAVEN'T FELT
THIS GOOD IN YEARS.

149
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,820
AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE
OF THE SUPPLEMENTS

150
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,788
HE HAS ME TAKING
AND THE SOLUBLE FIBER

151
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,424
AND THE INCREASE
IN REGULARITY.

152
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:57,691
IT'S HIM.

153
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,760
HE'S, UH, MOVING BACK
TO INDIANAPOLIS

154
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,095
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS,
WHICH SUCKS.

155
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,798
BUT IF HE ASKED ME
TO MOVE WITH HIM,

156
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,100
I THINK I WOULD.

157
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,702
- I WOULD LIKE A LOCAL BEER.

158
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,538
I'D LIKE IT IN A BOTTLE.

159
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:11,905
I'D LIKE THE BOTTLE
TO BE COLD.

160
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,841
- I WOULD LIKE
A GLASS OF WHITE WINE.

161
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,709
I WOULD LIKE IT
TO BE CHARDONNAY.

162
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,478
AND I WOULD LIKE THAT
WITH ONE ICE CUBE.

163
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,780
THANKS.

164
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,416
- CHIEF TRUMPLE?
- HEY, KNOPE.

165
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,152
- YOU KNOW BEN WYATT
FROM THE STATE BUDGET OFFICE.

166
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,554
- YEAH, HOW'S IT GOING?
- HELLO.

167
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:27,655
- THANKS FOR THE PARTY.
GOOD PIZZA.

168
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:31,024
- GREAT. SO, YEAH, THE PIZZA'S
DYNAMITE, ISN'T IT?

169
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,860
- I JUST SAID
IT WAS GOOD PIZZA.

170
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,729
IT'S GOOD.
PIZZA'S GOOD.

171
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:39,600
- YOU, UH,
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE?

172
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,435
CALZONES.

173
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:43,103
- WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY?

174
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,805
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU LATER.

175
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,774
- TAKE IT EASY.
- YEAH, WILL DO.

176
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:47,875
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

177
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:48,709
- I WAS GETTING SOMEWHERE
WITH THAT.

178
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,977
- YEAH, GREAT SMALL TALK
OVER THERE.

179
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,011
OKAY, LET ME HANDLE THIS.

180
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,145
- I GET A LITTLE NERVOUS
WITH COPS.

181
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,616
- I'M IN CONTROL.
- WHAT'S UP?

182
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,518
TOM HAVERFORD'S
IN THE BUILDING.

183
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:58,719
- WHOO!

184
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,821
- TOM, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

185
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,990
- SAME THING YOU'RE DOING,
CELEBRATING PAWNEE'S FINEST.

186
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,992
I BELIEVE YOU KNOW
MY DATE, TAMMY SWANSON.

187
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:05,993
- HIYA, RON.

188
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,462
- OH. HIYA, RON.
- HEY, RON.

189
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:09,797
- I'M SORRY.

190
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,165
IS SEEING YOUR EX-WIFE
ON MY ARM

191
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,534
MAKING YOU UNCOMFORTABLE?

192
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,637
GEE, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.
OR CAN I?

193
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,972
OOH, I LIKE THIS SONG.
DO YOU WANNA DANCE, TAMMY?

194
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:19,840
- OH, YEAH. YEAH.

195
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,242
OOH. UH.

196
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,845
- I KNOW TAMMY SEEMS SCARY.

197
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,980
BUT REALLY, SHE'S JUST
A MANIPULATIVE, PSYCHOTIC,

198
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,917
LIBRARY-BOOK-PEDALING,
SEX-CRAZED SHE-DEMON.

199
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,522
- UH! YEAH.
[laughs]

200
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,123
- I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH.
- TAMMY.

201
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,492
- UH. OH, HI, RON.

202
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,528
I WAS JUST TASTING
MY NEW BOYFRIEND, GLENN.

203
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:41,862
- TOM.

204
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,196
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE MIXED UP IN, SON.

205
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,499
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.
IT'S ABOUT ME.

206
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:48,569
- TYPICAL RON SWANSON.
ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF.

207
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,138
MAYBE WE LIKE EACH OTHER.
- YEAH, MAYBE WE DO.

208
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,240
- AH-EEY! OKAY.

209
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,742
LET'S TAKE IT EASY.

210
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,177
- TAMMY, LEAVE HIM
OUT OF THIS.

211
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,746
- OH, SO IT'S OKAY FOR YOU
TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,

212
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,180
BUT I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO SEE ANYBODY?

213
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,281
- DAMN IT, WOMAN.

214
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,551
JUST CRAWL BACK IN TO
THE DANK HOLE YOU CAME FROM

215
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,018
AND LEAVE
MY FRIENDS ALONE.

216
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,520
- OH! OKAY, OKAY.
LET'S SETTLE DOWN.

217
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:07,721
- WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE PROBLEM?

218
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:08,989
- WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM?
- IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE?

219
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,725
BASICALLY WHAT WE HAD HERE WAS
A DISPUTE OF A DOMESTIC NATURE.

220
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,294
- WHITE MALE, 40, 45.
- CAUCASIAN MALE.

221
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,930
STOCKY BUILD.
- APPROXIMATELY 5'10".

222
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,600
- VERBAL ALTERCATION TRANSPIRED
AT APPROXIMATELY 8:55 P.M.

223
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,868
WITH A FEMALE UNSUB.

224
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,536
APPEARS TO BE SLIGHTLY
INTOXICATED.

225
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,237
CLAIMS TO BE AN EX-SPOUSE.

226
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,873
REAL PIECE OF WORK.

227
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,575
- REAL PIECE OF WORK.
- REAL PIECE OF WORK.

228
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:28,942
- REAL PIECE OF WORK.

229
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,578
- I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE DOING THIS,

230
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,612
AND YOU'RE MAKING
A HUGE MISTAKE.

231
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,046
- FIGHT FIRE
WITH FIRE, LESLIE.

232
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,247
HE DATES MY EX,
I DATE HIS.

233
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,183
- RON AND WENDY AREN'T
EVEN DATING ANYMORE.

234
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,051
SHE'S MOVING BACK
TO CANADA.

235
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,920
- WHAT?
- UH-OH. OH, GOD.

236
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,221
OKAY, HEY.
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

237
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,791
- RON AND I ARE GOING
TO GET A CUP OF COFFEE

238
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:44,792
AND TALK THINGS OUT.

239
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,193
- IT'S TIME FOR TAMMY AND ME

240
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:49,262
TO BURY THE HATCHET
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

241
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,600
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

242
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:57,304
[moaning and groaning]

243
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,841
- IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS
FOR HOURS.

244
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,042
- RIGHT THERE.
RIGHT THERE.

245
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,811
- YEAH. YEAH.
- HEY, SWANSON!

246
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,345
[banging]

247
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,581
SNAP OUT OF IT!

248
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:08,949
- LESLIE.

249
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,283
CONGRATULATE US.

250
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:13,887
- RON'S GOT ONE
JUST LIKE IT ON HIS PENIS.

251
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,789
- OH, YEAH.

252
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,324
- WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO YOU?

253
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,860
- WELL...

254
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,896
[indistinct yelling]

255
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,671
- THANK YOU.

256
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,372
- [laughs]

257
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,008
- ROCK AND ROLL!
YEAH, BABY!

258
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,309
- I GOT IT!
- UH!

259
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,645
- YOU MAY NOW
KISS THE BRIDE.

260
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,648
[Wedding March playing]

261
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:48,021
*

262
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,323
- IT'S BEEN KIND OF
A CRAZY NIGHT.

263
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:51,825
- COME BACK, COME BACK.

264
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,694
[moaning and groaning]

265
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,363
- APRIL, COULD YOU
COME IN HERE A SECOND?

266
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,799
APRIL, WAY TO COME IN.
GREAT INITIATIVE.

267
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,768
- YOU CALLED ME IN.

268
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,269
- LISTEN, COULD YOU PLEASE
CALL ANN PERKINS

269
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,337
AND TELL HER THAT I WILL BE
UNABLE TO ENJOY LUNCH

270
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,674
WITH HER TODAY,
AS I AM JUST SWAMPED.

271
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:07,708
ALL DAY.

272
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,277
- COPY THAT.

273
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,412
HI, ANN.
THIS IS APRIL.

274
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,281
I'M JUST CALLING
TO LET YOU KNOW

275
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,316
THAT CHRIS CAN'T
MAKE LUNCH TODAY.

276
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:20,187
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T CARE.
GOOD-BYE.

277
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,755
- THEY STARTED HAVING SEX
AT THE COURT HOUSE.

278
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,056
WE HAD NO CHOICE.

279
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,025
- OH, WELL,
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

280
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,294
CHIEF, I NEED TO ASK YOU
A HUGE FAVOR.

281
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,361
- LESLIE.

282
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,197
- RON IS A GOOD MAN

283
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,732
WHO JUST GOT CAUGHT UP
IN SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

284
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,234
AND I WAS HOPING THAT MAYBE
YOU WOULD

285
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:37,871
REDUCE HIS CHARGES AND
RELEASE HIM INTO MY CUSTODY.

286
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:39,306
- ALL RIGHT.

287
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,341
BUT KEEP HIM AWAY
FROM THAT CRAZY LIBRARIAN.

288
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,210
- I'LL DO MY BEST.

289
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,344
- IN FACT, I DON'T WANT HIM

290
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,279
WITHIN 500 FEET
OF THE LIBRARY.

291
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,048
- THAT'S GOOD ADVICE
FOR ALL OF US.

292
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,316
- NOTHING BUT TROUBLE THERE.

293
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:52,085
- THANKS A LOT, BRO.
- HEY, STOP.

294
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,087
- SORRY.

295
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:56,924
- [groans]
TAKE ME BACK TO TAMMY.

296
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,425
- FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME,
NO.

297
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,894
- THAT WAS NOT THE FAVOR
WE NEEDED TO ASK FOR, LESLIE.

298
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,963
IF WE DON'T GET THE POLICE
FOR THE HARVEST FESTIVAL,

299
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,798
THERE IS NO HARVEST FESTIVAL.

300
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,233
- I KNOW.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT LATER.

301
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,402
- CAN YOU TURN THE RADIO OFF.
THIS IS OUR SONG.

302
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,204
- YOUR SONG IS
DANCING ON THE CEILING

303
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,240
BY LIONEL RITCHIE?

304
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,808
OH, WOW,
LOOK AT THAT.

305
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,009
YOU SHAVED OFF
PART OF YOUR MUSTACHE.

306
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,110
THAT'S LOVELY.

307
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:20,447
- I DIDN'T SHAVE IT OFF.
IT RUBBED OFF...

308
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,982
FROM FRICTION.

309
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,116
- UHH!

310
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,284
- UHHH!

311
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,152
- UHH!

312
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,487
- RON SWANSON,
THIS IS AN INTERVENTION.

313
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,923
YOU HAVE BEEN SPENDING
THE LAST 24 HOURS

314
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:32,993
SIPPING ON JOY JUICE
AND TRIPPING ON TAMMY.

315
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,262
WELL, THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM
ARE YOUR METHADONE.

316
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,930
AND WE'RE HERE
TO GET YOU CLEAN.

317
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:39,399
- CONGRATULATIONS.

318
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,770
HOLY MATRIMONY,
THERE'S THE MAN OF THE HOUR.

319
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,905
- JERRY, WHAT IS THIS?

320
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,006
- THAT IS THE SET
OF TUMBLERS

321
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,374
THAT I GOT
FROM THE REGISTRY.

322
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,409
- THIS IS AN INTERVENTION.

323
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,744
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
ON THE PHONE

324
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,045
IT WAS A RECEPTION.

325
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,114
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S BEGIN.

326
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:57,017
- I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS
THE GOOFY-LOOKING,

327
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,153
DIRTY-KIMONO-WEARING,
CORN-ROWED CLOWN IN THE ROOM.

328
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:04,524
IF YOU SEE RON SWANSON,
CAN YOU GIVE HIM THIS MESSAGE?

329
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,994
YOU USED TO BE A MAN.

330
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,096
YOU NEED TO GET
YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER.

331
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,064
LOOK, I LOVE YOU
LIKE A BROTHER

332
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,233
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I HATE YOU

333
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,135
LIKE MY ACTUAL BROTHER,
LEVONDRIOUS,

334
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,237
WHO I HATE.

335
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,271
- OKAY, TOM.

336
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,240
- RON, YOU LOOK GREAT.

337
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,509
YOUR SKIN IS GLOWING.
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU SO HAPPY.

338
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,511
- OKAY, SIT DOWN.

339
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,947
- ANDY.

340
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,050
- RON, I DO NOT REALLY
UNDERSTAND

341
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,052
WHAT IS GOING ON
RIGHT NOW.

342
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:37,324
BUT NO MATTER WHAT,

343
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,827
YOU MUST KEEP GOING.

344
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,161
- NO.

345
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,964
- YOU MUST STOP.

346
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,899
I LOVE YOU, BUDDY.

347
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:49,002
FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS.

348
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:50,838
- POWERFUL STUFF.

349
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,009
- APRIL?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

350
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:59,079
- I WORK FOR YOUR BOYFRIEND.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

351
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,314
- I CAME TO SEE WHY CHRIS
STOOD ME UP FOR LUNCH,

352
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:03,016
BUT I THINK I JUST
FIGURED IT OUT.

353
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,251
- BECAUSE HE
DOESN'T LIKE YOU?

354
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,385
- NO, I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT'S NOT IT.

355
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,588
- ACTUALLY IT'S BECAUSE
I DIDN'T CALL YOU DELIBERATELY.

356
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,291
WHICH, IF YOU ASK ME,
IS A FIREABLE OFFENSE.

357
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,893
SO I WOULD TELL HIM THAT.

358
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,328
ALSO, HE'S NOT
INTO YOU SEXUALLY.

359
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,330
- MMM.
- ANN PERKINS.

360
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,298
APRIL LUDGATE.

361
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,600
LITERALLY TWO OF
MY FAVORITE PEOPLE ON EARTH.

362
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,202
I'M SORRY THAT I HAD
TO CANCEL LUNCH.

363
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,337
- NOT AT ALL.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

364
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:27,374
APRIL HERE WAS VERY
APOLOGETIC ON THE PHONE.

365
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,608
SHE ALSO SENT ME FLOWERS.

366
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,444
- APRIL.
NICE TOUCH.

367
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,450
- HELLO, RON.
IT'S RON.

368
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,288
IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS,
IT MEANS THAT ONCE AGAIN

369
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,190
YOU HAVE DANCED
WITH THE DEVIL.

370
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,158
RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING

371
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,927
TAMMY'S CHANGED.

372
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,328
WE'LL BE HAPPY TOGETHER.

373
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,963
BUT YOU'RE ONLY
THINKING THAT

374
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:52,199
BECAUSE SHE'S
A MONSTROUS PARASITE

375
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,301
WHO ENTERED THROUGH
YOUR PRIVATES

376
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,870
AND LODGED HERSELF
IN YOUR BRAIN.

377
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,605
SO YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES--

378
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,108
ONE, GET RID OF TAMMY,

379
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:04,344
OR TWO, LOBOTOMY
AND CASTRATION.

380
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,413
CHOOSE WISELY.

381
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,316
YOU STUPID [bleep].

382
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,484
THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.

383
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:15,088
YOU PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

384
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:18,258
- THAT WAS YOU ON THE TAPE.
THAT WAS YOU TALKING.

385
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,227
- RON? RON!

386
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,396
RON.
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

387
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,333
[chuckling]
AH!

388
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,036
- RON. STOP IT.
GOD, PLEASE.

389
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:32,472
RON, DON'T DO THAT.
- OH, IT'S DONE, LESLIE.

390
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,341
TAMMY AND I ARE IN LOVE,

391
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,443
AND WE'RE GONNA START A FAMILY
TOGETHER.

392
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,511
IN FACT, SHE'S OVULATING.

393
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,247
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US,

394
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,082
WE'RE HEADING OFF
ON OUR HONEYMOON.

395
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,318
- WOW. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- JERRY.

396
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,321
- WE'RE GONNA SPEND 11 DAYS
IN MY CABIN IN THE WOODS.

397
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,223
- WE BOUGHT
10 CASES OF GATORADE

398
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:53,093
AND A 40-POUND BAG
OF PEANUTS FOR ENERGY.

399
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,029
- OH, GOD.
- GIVE ME IT.

400
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:59,466
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
EXCUSE ME.

401
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,501
- OH, YEAH.
OH, GOD.

402
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,604
- ANN AND I ARE HEADED OUT,

403
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,239
AND I JUST
WANTED TO THANK YOU

404
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,276
FOR EVERYTHING TODAY,
AND I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

405
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,477
[knocking]

406
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,379
- HI, CHRIS.

407
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,948
UH, RON SWANSON
HAS SENT ME OVER

408
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,517
TO DELIVER TO YOU
THIS DOCUMENT.

409
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,988
- "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,
DEAR CHRIS,

410
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,556
"THERE IS AN EMERGENCY REGARDING
THE PARKS DEPARTMENT,

411
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,559
"AND APRIL MAY JUST BE
THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN HELP.

412
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:30,430
"I CAN'T GET INTO DETAILS
BECAUSE IT'S SUPER-CLASSIFIED.

413
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,599
"PLEASE RELEASE APRIL
BACK TO US PERMANENTLY.

414
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,467
"GOD BLESS AMERICA.

415
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:38,571
LOVE, BERT MACKLIN, FBI."

416
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:39,672
- WHAT?

417
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,374
- OKAY. WELL, BYE.

418
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,176
- APRIL, LISTEN.

419
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,012
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
WORK FOR ME,

420
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,046
I'M NOT GONNA FORCE YOU.

421
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,314
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

422
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,648
- SHE DIDN'T DO THAT.
THAT--THAT WAS--

423
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,417
DUDE, I THINK IT SOUNDS
LIKE IT WAS MACKLIN'S CALL.

424
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,651
- LOOK, I GET IT.

425
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:55,122
YOU'RE YOUNG,
AND TRYING ISN'T COOL.

426
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,556
BUT I THINK YOU'RE SMART.

427
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,292
I'M GONNA BE GOING BACK
TO INDIANAPOLIS SOON,

428
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,761
AND I THINK YOU SHOULD
COME WORK FOR ME.

429
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,531
- WOW, MOVE ALL THE WAY
TO INDIANAPOLIS,

430
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,334
SO I CAN PICK UP YOUR
VITAMINS AND SUPPLEMENTS.

431
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,269
- EVERYBODY
STARTS SOMEWHERE.

432
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,503
YOU'LL TRAVEL,

433
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:13,073
AND YOU WILL MEET
INTERESTING PEOPLE.

434
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,774
THINK ABOUT IT.

435
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,045
- OKAY. I WILL.

436
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,147
- APPARENTLY HE WANTS APRIL

437
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,150
TO MOVE TO INDIANAPOLIS
WITH HIM.

438
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,418
SO THAT'S SOMETHING.

439
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:28,088
[tapping]

440
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,556
- I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

441
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:33,126
- LOOK, I JUST WANTED TO
SHOW HIM WHAT IT FELT LIKE

442
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,428
TO HAVE YOUR EX-WIFE
DATE SOMEONE YOU KNOW.

443
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,165
WHATEVER HAPPENED AFTER THAT
IS NOT MY FAULT.

444
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:38,998
- YES, IT IS.

445
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,368
TOM, YOU DID
A REALLY CRAPPY THING,

446
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,703
AND I THINK DEEP DOWN,
YOU KNOW THAT.

447
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:48,108
WHATEVER HAPPENS
TO RON SWANSON IS ON YOU.

448
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,713
[knocking]

449
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,216
- EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

450
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,185
- HEY, CALZONE BOY,
WHAT'S UP?

451
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:01,054
- WELL, HERE'S HOPING THAT
THAT NICKNAME DOESN'T STICK.

452
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,823
RIGHT?

453
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,059
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHY I'M HERE.

454
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:09,762
UH, LESLIE KNOPE ASKED YOU
FOR A FAVOR THE OTHER DAY,

455
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,764
BUT THE REAL FAVOR WE NEED
IS MUCH BIGGER.

456
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:14,367
- YOU MEAN,
LIKE CALZONE-SIZED?

457
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,504
- AH! SURE.

458
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,572
WE NEED
THE PAWNEE POLICE FORCE

459
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:20,840
TO VOLUNTEER AS SECURITY

460
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,742
DURING THE UPCOMING
HARVEST FESTIVAL.

461
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,078
NOW, THE CITY WON'T LET US
THROW THE FESTIVAL UNLESS--

462
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,679
- SAY NO MORE.

463
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,448
JUST SEND ME A SCHEDULE OF HOW
MANY OFFICERS YOU NEED AND WHEN.

464
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,817
- REALLY?
JUST LIKE THAT?

465
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,186
- LESLIE KNOPE GETS
AS MANY FAVORS AS SHE NEEDS.

466
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,122
- CAN I ASK WHY?

467
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,457
- BECAUSE SHE'S
THE KIND OF A PERSON

468
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,292
WHO USES FAVORS
TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE.

469
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,228
AND ALSO, MY BUDDY DAVE

470
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,729
WAS THE CRANKIEST BASTARD
IN THE DEPARTMENT

471
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,097
TILL HE STARTED
DATING LESLIE.

472
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:47,834
- HUH. SO SHE...
OKAY.

473
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,669
ARE THEY STILL DATING OR--?

474
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,705
- NO. MOVED TO SAN DIEGO
A YEAR AGO.

475
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,607
- OH.

476
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,609
WAS IT A SERIOUS THING,
OR--?

477
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,778
- WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU A PERVERT?

478
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,213
- NOPE, NOPE.
I'M ALL GOOD.

479
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,814
UM, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

480
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,850
THIS IS FINE.

481
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,686
- DON'T THINK
I WON'T DO IT.

482
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,720
I'LL WEAR THIS TO WORK.

483
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,522
[laughter]

484
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,158
ALL RIGHT,
WE GOT A LITTLE ONE.

485
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,825
OOH, WHAT'S IN HERE, HUH?

486
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,695
[gasps]
A NEW LIBRARY CARD?

487
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:16,729
- READ THE NAME.

488
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,431
- "TAMMY SWANSON SWANSON."

489
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:19,432
[laughter]

490
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,768
YOU GUYS, THAT'S AMAZING.

491
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,870
[laughter]

492
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,872
- WELL, YOU ABOUT READY
TO GO, MY LOVE?

493
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,340
- YEAH.
- WAIT, RON!

494
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:28,508
STOP!

495
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,443
JERRY, WHAT THE HELL?

496
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,845
DON'T DO IT.
SHE DOESN'T LOVE YOU.

497
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,747
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

498
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,782
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

499
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,817
- YES, I DO, OKAY?

500
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,818
WHEN I ASKED HER
TO BE MY DATE,

501
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,153
SHE CACKLED
FOR A FULL MINUTE

502
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:42,822
AND SAID, AND I QUOTE,

503
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,725
"ANYTHING TO MAKE RON
MISERABLE."

504
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,760
IT'S NOT REAL, MAN.

505
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:48,695
SHE'S JUST MESSING
WITH YOU.

506
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,664
- HE'S LYING, RON.
STAY OUT OF THIS, GLENN.

507
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,600
- IT'S TOM.
AND I'M NOT LYING.

508
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,934
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
DESTROY RON.

509
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,803
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO--OW!

510
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,505
OW! AAH!

511
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,607
- OH!
HE'S ATTACKING ME, RON!

512
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,709
KILL HIM!
- [groans]

513
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,278
- [growls]

514
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,279
- [screams]

515
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:09,949
- [laughs]

516
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,186
YEAH!
DO YOUR WORST, GLENN!

517
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,221
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

518
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:15,655
- AAAAH!
- AAH!

519
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,590
[moans]

520
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:18,758
- WHY ARE YOU
HITTING YOURSELF, GLENN?

521
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,493
STOP HITTING YOURSELF.

522
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,529
- TAMMY, THAT'S ENOUGH!

523
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,696
- WHAT?

524
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,498
HEY, BABY.

525
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,800
- YOU ALMOST HAD ME.

526
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,936
AGAIN.

527
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,804
BUT SEEING YOU PICK
ON THIS PATHETIC,

528
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,206
DEFENSELESS LITTLE MAN...

529
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,207
- HEY.

530
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,876
- REMINDED ME WHAT KIND
OF A MONSTER YOU ARE.

531
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,245
- YOU'RE A JOKE.

532
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,213
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
A MAN ANYMORE.

533
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:42,282
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
LAST NIGHT,

534
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,317
I FAKED FOUR
OUT OF THE SEVEN.

535
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:47,320
- HMM. SO DID I.

536
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,322
LET'S GO, SON.

537
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,830
- HEY.
- HEY.

538
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:58,865
SORRY ABOUT THE WHOLE MESS.

539
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,800
THE CRISIS
HAS BEEN AVERTED,

540
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,902
SO LET'S GO TALK
TO THE CHIEF.

541
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:03,936
- OH, I ALREADY
TALKED TO HIM.

542
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,905
THEY'LL GIVE US THE HOURS
WE NEED, NO PROBLEM.

543
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,675
- GREAT. WHAT A RELIEF.
- YEAH.

544
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:12,845
HEY, ARE YOU HUNGRY?
I HAVEN'T EATEN.

545
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:13,713
- YOU KNOW, YEAH.

546
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:14,747
THERE'S A REALLY GREAT
CALZONE PLACE

547
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:15,748
OVER IN IDIOTVILLE.

548
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,917
- OH, REALLY?
- DOWN ON TERRIBLE IDEA AVENUE.

549
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,118
- OKAY. THAT'S WEIRD.

550
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:23,656
'CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS ON
BEATING-A-DEAD-HORSE BOULEVARD.

551
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,292
- CALZONES ARE POINTLESS.

552
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,427
THEY'RE JUST PIZZA
THAT'S HARDER TO EAT.

553
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,629
NO ONE LIKES THEM.

554
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:30,830
GOOD DAY, SIR.

555
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,766
- LESLIE, I--
YOU KNOW, I--

556
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,702
- I'M JUST KIDDING.
LET'S GO.

557
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:36,936
- OH.
[laughs weakly]

558
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,871
OKAY. THAT WAS FUNNY.

559
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,379
- HIGH AND TIGHT.

560
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,415
- DO YOU THINK
IT'S GONNA LEAVE A SCAR?

561
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,949
- TOM, WOMEN LIKE SCARS.

562
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,751
SHOWS YOU SURVIVED
AN ATTACK,

563
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,787
AND THEY'LL ASSUME
THE ATTACK WAS FROM A MAN.

564
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,924
- SORRY, RON,
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

565
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,492
- AH.

566
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:00,827
TO TRUE LOVE.

567
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,662
MAY WE BOTH FIND IT.

568
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:05,398
- I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

569
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,534
NICE GLASSES.

570
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,469
- WEDDING PRESENT
FROM JERRY.

571
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:10,470
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
RETURN THEM?

572
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,739
- NAH.
TOO MUCH HASSLE.
