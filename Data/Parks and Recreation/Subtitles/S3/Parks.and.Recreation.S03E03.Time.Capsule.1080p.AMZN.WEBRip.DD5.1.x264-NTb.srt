1
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:03,771
- OKAY, JERRY,
WHAT HAVE YOU CHOSEN

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,273
TO PUT IN THE TIME CAPSULE?

3
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:07,408
- THESE ARE MY MOTHER'S DIARIES.

4
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,376
- WOW.

5
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,078
- YEAH, SHE LIVED IN PAWNEE
ALL OF HER LIFE

6
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,812
AND RECORDED EVERYTHING
SHE EVER DID.

7
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,147
YEAH, SO IT'S, YOU KNOW,
KIND OF LIKE

8
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:14,782
A LIVING DOCUMENT
ABOUT THE TOWN.

9
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:15,716
- HMM.

10
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,152
A DISAPPOINTINGLY
GOOD IDEA FROM JERRY.

11
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:19,587
- BETTER THAN GOOD, JERRY.
PERFECT.

12
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,189
- GIVE ME THAT.

13
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,624
"JANUARY 18, 1964.

14
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:26,727
"JERROLD STARRED IN HIS SCHOOL
PRODUCTION OF PETER PAN.

15
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,729
HE WAS A BEAUTIFUL
TINKER BELL."

16
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,398
[laughter]

17
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,200
- IT WAS AN ALL-BOYS SCHOOL.

18
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,734
- [speaking Spanish]

19
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,736
- [speaking Spanish]

20
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,207
- [laughs]
JERRY!

21
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,308
- HEY, LESLIE,
I HAVE AN IDEA.

22
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,176
WHY DON'T WE PUT EDUARDO
IN THERE

23
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,646
AND SEAL THE TOP SO
THAT HE SUFFOCATES AND DIES?

24
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,082
- OKAY, TOM, YOU'RE UP.

25
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:50,384
- FOR MY ITEM,
I CHOSE A PICTURE

26
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:52,520
OF MY EX-GIRLFRIEND LUCY

27
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,422
WITH A MUSTACHE DRAWN
ON HER FACE

28
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,657
AND STINK LINES COMING OFF HER,
'CAUSE SHE STINKS.

29
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,427
SHE BROKE UP WITH ME.
DIDN'T REALLY TELL ME WHY.

30
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,728
LUCKILY,
WHEN YOU'RE THE GUY,

31
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,363
YOU CAN JUST TELL PEOPLE
SHE'S CRAZY.

32
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,732
"HEY, TOM, I HEARD YOU
AND LUCY BROKE UP."

33
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,368
"YEAH, MAN.
TURNS OUT SHE'S CRAZY."

34
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,703
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO
ON ENTOURAGE.

35
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,139
- RON?

36
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:12,506
- I AM SUBMITTING THIS MENU

37
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,109
FROM A PAWNEE INSTITUTION,
JJ'S DINER,

38
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:17,411
HOME OF THE WORLD'S BEST
BREAKFAST DISH,

39
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:20,114
THE FOUR HORSE MEALS
OF THE EGG-PORK-ALYPSE.

40
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:21,715
WENDY LOVES IT TOO.

41
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,418
- AND I AM SUBMITTING THIS.

42
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:27,521
A BRIEF HISTORY OF EVERYTHING
THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED

43
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,789
SINCE PAWNEE WAS FOUNDED.

44
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,791
NOT LIKE YOU GET
EXTRA CREDIT FOR THIS,

45
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,260
BUT I DID TYPE IT
FROM MEMORY.

46
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,794
AND FOR THE FIRST
TIME EVER COMPILED,

47
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,464
IT INCLUDES A COMPLETE LIST

48
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,832
OF EVERY OFFICIAL TOWN SLOGAN
WE'VE EVER HAD.

49
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,168
- OH, MY GOD, LESLIE.
- I KNOW. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

50
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,802
- THAT'S CRAZY.
- ISN'T IT?

51
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,272
"PAWNEE:
THE PARIS OF AMERICA.

52
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:47,175
"PAWNEE: THE AKRON
OF SOUTHWEST INDIANA.

53
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,677
PAWNEE:
WELCOME, GERMAN SOLDIERS."

54
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,846
AFTER THE NAZIS TOOK FRANCE,
OUR MAYOR KIND OF PANICKED.

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,383
"PAWNEE: THE FACTORY FIRE
CAPITAL OF AMERICA.

56
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,851
"PAWNEE: WELCOME,
VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS.

57
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,221
PAWNEE: ENGAGE WITH ZORP."

58
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,755
FOR A BRIEF TIME
IN THE '70s,

59
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,824
OUR TOWN
WAS TAKEN OVER BY A CULT.

60
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,427
"PAWNEE: ZORP IS DEAD.
LONG LIVE ZORP.

61
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,529
"PAWNEE: IT'S SAFE
TO BE HERE NOW.

62
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,199
PAWNEE: BIRTHPLACE
OF JULIA ROBERTS."

63
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,501
THAT WAS A LIE, SHE SUED,
AND SO WE HAD TO CHANGE IT.

64
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,603
"PAWNEE:
HOME OF THE WORLD-FAMOUS

65
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,171
"JULIA ROBERTS LAWSUIT.

66
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:19,673
PAWNEE:
WELCOME, TALIBAN SOLDIERS."

67
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,775
AND FINALLY,
OUR CURRENT SLOGAN:

68
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,346
"PAWNEE: FIRST IN FRIENDSHIP,
FOURTH IN OBESITY."

69
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,349
[triumphant music]

70
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:35,889
*

71
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,801
- YES, PAWNEE HAS HAD
ITS SET OF PROBLEMS,

72
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,639
BUT THIS TIME CAPSULE
IS OUR WAY OF SAYING

73
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,808
THAT PAWNEE IS GONNA BE AROUND
FOR A LONG TIME...

74
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:55,776
CAPSULE.

75
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,378
AND YOU CAN QUOTE ME
ON THAT.

76
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,846
- OH, I'M ACTUALLY GONNA
QUOTE YOU ON ALL OF THIS,

77
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,414
'CAUSE IT'S A NEWSPAPER
ARTICLE.

78
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:01,682
- I THOUGHT OF A GREAT HEADLINE.
- GREAT.

79
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,385
- IT'S TIME TO ENCAPSULATE
THE FUTURE.

80
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,686
- GOOD ONE.
- SUB HEADLINE:

81
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,455
THE PARKS DEPARTMENT
CUTS THE CRAPSULE,

82
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:08,722
BURIES THE TIME CAPSULE.

83
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,291
- I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW
WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHER.

84
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,825
- OKAY.

85
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,694
- LESLIE, THIS GUY'S HERE.

86
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,429
- HI.
CAN I HELP YOU?

87
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:16,830
- I'M KELLY LARSON.

88
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,399
I READ ONLINE
ABOUT YOUR TIME CAPSULE,

89
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:19,733
AND I'M HERE TO MAKE
A SUGGESTION.

90
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,502
- OH, I'M SORRY.
WE'RE NOT TAKING SUGGES--

91
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,703
- THE TWILIGHT BOOKS.

92
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,772
IT'S A BEAUTIFULLY-TOLD SAGA
OF VAMPIRES,

93
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,274
WEREWOLVES, AND ROMANCE.

94
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:27,908
- AH, YOU ARE THE PERSON
THAT'S BEEN EMAILING ME

95
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,743
ABOUT TWILIGHT.

96
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,679
I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD BE YOUNGER...

97
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,013
AND A GIRL.

98
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,848
- WELL, I'M NOT.
I'M OLDER AND A BOY.

99
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,485
BUT I FEEL VERY STRONGLY
THAT THESE SHOULD BE INCLUDED.

100
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,587
CAN I TELL YOU WHY?

101
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,388
- SURE, KELLY.
HAVE A SEAT.

102
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,022
- AWESOME.
- AND PLEAD YOUR CASE.

103
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,958
- THANKS.
OKAY, CHRISTMAS EVE, 1973.

104
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,927
AUTHOR STEPHENIE MEYER,
NEE MORGAN,

105
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,596
WAS BORN IN HARTFORD,
CONNECTICUT.

106
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,699
- OH, YOU'RE GOING ALL
THE WAY BACK TO HER BIRTH. OKAY.

107
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,734
- SO BASICALLY,
ANN KISSED ME

108
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,604
AND THEN APRIL KISSED ME,
AND I TOLD APRIL,

109
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,739
BECAUSE OF HONESTY
IS IMPORTANT.

110
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,574
- THAT'S SO TRUE.

111
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:01,942
- BUT NOW SHE'S GONE
AND GOTTEN HERSELF

112
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,844
A VENEZUELAN BOYFRIEND
WHO'S, LIKE,

113
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,746
THE HANDSOMEST DUDE
I'VE EVER SEEN.

114
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,615
PRESENT COMPANY EXCLUDED.

115
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:08,982
- OH, THANK YOU.

116
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:10,918
- [chuckles]
UH, I WAS TALKING ABOUT ME.

117
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,820
- HEY.

118
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:13,754
- ANN PERKINS!

119
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,823
ANDY JUST GAVE ME
A PHENOMENAL SHOESHINE

120
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,426
AND I DID NOT KNOW THAT
YOU TWO ONCE LIVED TOGETHER.

121
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,294
- YES.
YES, WE DID.

122
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:22,996
THANK YOU FOR CATCHING HIM UP
ON OUR HISTORY.

123
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,865
- ANDY, THAT WAS
AN AMAZING SHOESHINE.

124
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:29,370
I CAN LITERALLY SEE MY FACE
IN MY SHOES.

125
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:30,738
SEE YOU LATER!

126
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,639
- HE DIDN'T--
HE DIDN'T PAY ME.

127
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,407
- WHY ARE YOU HANGING OUT
WITH CHRIS?

128
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,608
- HE JUST SAT DOWN.

129
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:35,809
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
HE'S MY BOSS.

130
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,678
- NO, HE'S NOT.
- HE ISN'T?

131
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,647
GOD DANG IT.

132
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,782
I CANNOT FIGURE OUT
WHO MY BOSS IS.

133
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,351
- ANDY, I LIKE THIS GUY.

134
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:46,320
PLEASE DON'T DO ANYTHING WEIRD,
I BEG YOU.

135
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,989
I JUST STARTED DATING CHRIS,
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW,

136
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,791
BUT ANDY'S GONNA SCREW IT UP.

137
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,726
ANDY SCREWS EVERYTHING UP.

138
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,662
WHEN WE WERE DATING,
I BOUGHT HIM A FISH

139
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,063
AND I DON'T WANT
TO GET INTO IT,

140
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:59,833
BUT SOMEHOW THAT FISH ENDED UP
DEAD IN A COWBOY BOOT.

141
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,635
- AND COMBINED,
THEY HAVE SOLD MORE THAN

142
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,804
100 MILLION COPIES WORLDWIDE.

143
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,973
NOW, HAVE YOU SEEN ANY
OF THE TWILIGHT MOVIES?

144
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,508
- NO, I HAVE NOT.

145
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,577
- WELL, LET ME DESCRIBE THEM
TO YOU SHOT-FOR-SHOT.

146
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,712
MOVIE NUMBER ONE.
TWILIGHT.

147
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,814
WE SLOWLY PAN UP
OVER A MOSSY LOG

148
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,883
TO SEE A DEER DRINKING
CRYSTAL-CLEAR WATER.

149
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,386
- OKAY, KELLY,
THIS TIME CAPSULE

150
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,522
ISN'T JUST A BARREL FULL
OF STUFF THAT PEOPLE LIKE.

151
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:24,692
IT'S ABOUT LIFE IN PAWNEE
AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME,

152
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,727
AND THERE IS NOTHING
IN TWILIGHT

153
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,496
THAT IS SPECIFIC TO PAWNEE.

154
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,630
- I DISAGREE, OKAY?

155
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,065
THE TOWN OF FORKS, WASHINGTON
IS EXACTLY LIKE PAWNEE,

156
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:35,603
EXCEPT FOR THE CLIMATE
AND THE VAMPIRES.

157
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:36,970
- I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO SAY NO.

158
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,839
- I BEG YOU TO RECONSIDER.

159
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:39,973
- AND I'M GONNA
HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

160
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,010
- THEN I'M GONNA
HAVE TO DO THIS.

161
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:49,917
- HE BROUGHT HANDCUFFS
WITH HIM.

162
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,619
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS PLANNED.

163
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,020
- I THINK IT'S KIND OF COOL.

164
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,588
- IT'S NOT COOL.

165
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:56,490
IT'S TRESPASSING,
AND THAT IS BREAKING THE RULES.

166
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,459
COOL PEOPLE MAKE THE RULES.
THEY DON'T BREAK THE RULES.

167
00:05:58,492 --> 00:05:59,693
AND IF THOSE KIDS WANT YOU
TO BREAK THE RULES,

168
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:00,961
THEN THEY AREN'T
REALLY YOUR FRIENDS.

169
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,796
- WHOA, WHO ARE YOU EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?

170
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,064
- I DON'T KNOW.
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST ANNOYED.

171
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,733
BUT WHILE
WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT,

172
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,001
YOUR FRIEND ORRIN WITH THE LONG
BLACK NAILS AND THE CLOAK?

173
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,002
HE CONCERNS ME.

174
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,638
- HE'S A GENIUS.

175
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,706
- I'LL CARE OF
THIS TRESPASSER.

176
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,708
GIVE ME 30 SECONDS.

177
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:15,943
- I'M JUST GONNA CALL SECURITY.

178
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,679
- GUYS, CAN WE PUSH
THE MEETING AN HOUR?

179
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,813
WHAT'S GOING ON?

180
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,082
- SOME GUY HANDCUFFED HIMSELF
TO A PIPE IN MY OFFICE

181
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,884
BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T PUT
A COPY OF TWILIGHT

182
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:24,818
IN THE TIME CAPSULE.

183
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,087
- DAMN IT. AGAIN?

184
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,691
- YOU LOOK SAD.

185
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,859
- YOU LOOK LIKE A WEIRD GOON

186
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,461
WHO'S OBSESSED
WITH A KID'S BOOK.

187
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:34,662
- IT'S A GIRL, ISN'T IT?

188
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,196
I CAN TELL.

189
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,765
IT'S THE LOOK THAT MIKE
HAD ON HIS FACE

190
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,800
WHEN BELLA TURNED HIM DOWN
FOR THE DANCE.

191
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,201
- OH, YEAH? IS IT?

192
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,770
WHAT LOOK DID YOUR MOM
HAVE ON HER FACE

193
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,738
WHEN SHE REALIZED HER SON
WAS A COMPLETE FAILURE?

194
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,707
- OKAY, I'LL BE QUIET.

195
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,009
BUT I DO KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT HEARTBREAK.

196
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,611
AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE DOES?

197
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,146
- KENNETH "BABYFACE" EDMONDS?
- NO.

198
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,650
A LITTLE LADY NAMED TWILIGHT
AUTHOR STEPHENIE MEYER.

199
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:58,686
TRUST ME.

200
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:59,920
- YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM.

201
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,855
THOSE BOOKS ARE GOOD.

202
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,525
OH, I LOVE ANY BOOK
ABOUT VAMPIRES,

203
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,960
WEREWOLVES, MONSTERS,
ZOMBIES,

204
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:11,131
SORCERERS, BEASTIES,
OR TIME-TRAVELING ROMANCES.

205
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,767
AND IF I HAD AN HOUR ALONE
WITH ROBERT PATTINSON,

206
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,769
HE WOULD FORGET ALL ABOUT
SKINNYLEGS MCGEE.

207
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:16,804
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

208
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,672
- OKAY, BUDDY, TIME IS UP.

209
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:19,607
GIVE US THE KEYS.

210
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,875
- THEY'RE HIDDEN SOMEWHERE
VERY FAR AWAY.

211
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,043
- THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CUT YOU LOOSE.

212
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,645
- WHY?
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

213
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,547
- YES, YOU ARE.
YOU'RE TRESPASSING.

214
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,882
- WELL, THE FACT REMAINS
THIS IS PERFECTLY LEGAL.

215
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,718
- NO, IT'S NOT.
YOU'RE TRESPASSING.

216
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,720
- LOOK, I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO CAUSE ANY TROUBLE,

217
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,722
BUT I AM NOT GONNA LEAVE
UNTIL YOU

218
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:35,889
PUT TWILIGHT
IN THE TIME CAPSULE.

219
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,725
THIS MUSCLE-HEADED
STORM TROOPER

220
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:38,892
DOESN'T SCARE ME.

221
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,028
- GO AHEAD, ARTIE.

222
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,730
- [screaming]
NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!

223
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:45,799
PLEASE! NO! NO! NO! NO!
NO! NO! GET HIM AWAY FROM ME!

224
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,200
I AM VERY SCARED OF YOU!

225
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,736
[screaming]
- ALL RIGHT!

226
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,070
OKAY! ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT!

227
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,605
STOP.

228
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,740
IF HE WANTS TO STAY
IN THERE,

229
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:53,841
I'LL LET HIM STAY IN THERE.

230
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,643
IN TWO HOURS,
HE'S GONNA BE SO HUNGRY

231
00:07:55,676 --> 00:08:00,280
AND FREAKED OUT,
HE'S GONNA BE BEGGING ME TO...

232
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,249
HE BROUGHT A PILLOW.

233
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,884
- HEY, LESLIE, I'M MAKING
SOME SLEEPYTIME TEA.

234
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,819
YOU WANT ANY?
- [sighs]

235
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,258
- HEY, DUDE,
WAKE UP, MAN.

236
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,594
- OH, MORNING, TOM.

237
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,996
- TWILIGHT IS DOPE.

238
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,098
- I TOLD YOU.
- I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.

239
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,200
IT WAS LIKE SHE WAS PEERING
INTO MY SOUL.

240
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,269
- SING IT, FRIEND.
HERE.

241
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,138
BOOK TWO.
TWILIGHT: NEW MOON.

242
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,540
GET CRACKING.

243
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:27,875
- THERE'S A SECOND BOOK?

244
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,177
- AND A THIRD AND A FOURTH.

245
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,180
- NO [bleep] WAY.

246
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,915
- IT'S FANTASTIC.
- YEAH.

247
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,017
I WORKED REALLY HARD.
I DID EVERY PAIR THAT I COULD.

248
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,787
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH THESE.

249
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,922
I THINK THEY'RE GLOVES.
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

250
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,156
THOSE ARE SPORTS SANDALS.

251
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,625
THEY'RE FOR ADVENTURE RACING.

252
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,860
THEY PERFECTLY CONTOUR
TO THE HUMAN FOOT,

253
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,863
AND THE HUMAN FOOT
IS THE ULTIMATE TECHNOLOGY.

254
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,632
- DUDE, THAT IS
THE COOLEST SENTENCE

255
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,200
I'VE EVER HEARD SOMEBODY TALK.

256
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,069
- SO YOU LOVE APRIL,

257
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,204
AND SHE HAS A NEW BOYFRIEND,
RIGHT?

258
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,573
- YOU GOT ALL OF THAT
FROM A PICTURE?

259
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:01,675
- NO, YOU TOLD ME YESTERDAY.
ANDY...

260
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:05,345
I WANT TO HELP YOU
WIN HER OVER.

261
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,847
WHY DO I WANT TO HELP HIM?

262
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,348
BECAUSE HE'S A GOOD PERSON.

263
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,183
I LOVE GOOD PEOPLE.

264
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,686
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHO SHOULD
WEAR THESE SHOES?

265
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,722
MONKEYS.

266
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,126
- WELL, THIS IS AN INTERESTING
TURN OF EVENTS.

267
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,360
- IS IT?
I-I DON'T KNOW.

268
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,929
I MEAN, I GUESS
IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING.

269
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:22,996
WHAT THE REAL STORY IS

270
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,165
IS HOW WONDERFUL
OUR TIME CAPSULE IS

271
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,735
AND HOW IT PERFECTLY
ENCAPSULATES--

272
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,202
A WORD I REALLY
THINK YOU SHOULD USE--

273
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,238
WHAT OUR TOWN IS ALL ABOUT.

274
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,773
- HEY, HOW'S THIS
FOR A HEADLINE?

275
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,175
"PARKS DEPARTMENT
FOILED BY PIPE DREAMS."

276
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,310
- GOD, THAT'S
AN AMAZING HEADLINE,

277
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,179
BUT PLEASE DON'T
WRITE THAT STORY.

278
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,215
- THE KEY TO APRIL'S HEART
IS WITHIN YOU, ANDY.

279
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,084
YOU NEED TO TAP IN
TO THE ASPECTS

280
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,920
OF YOUR PERSONALITY
THAT SHE ONCE FOUND ATTRACTIVE

281
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:50,157
TO MAKE YOURSELF THE BEST
VERSION OF YOURSELF.

282
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,258
WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT YOU?

283
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,993
- I'M NICE.

284
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,394
- GOOD! NICE.

285
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,129
WHAT ELSE?

286
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,264
- I'M IN A BAND.

287
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,299
- BAND!

288
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:03,136
WHAT ELSE?
- THAT'S IT.

289
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,272
- AM I TEAM EDWARD?
YES.

290
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,408
DO I SHARE HIS CONCERNS
ABOUT TURNING BELLA, THOUGH?

291
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,010
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

292
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,379
- EDWARD'S PRIMARY GOAL
AT ALL TIMES

293
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,014
IS BELLA'S PROTECTION.

294
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,184
- CAN YOU PLEASE,
PLEASE BE QUIET?

295
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,285
- SORRY. SORRY.

296
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,821
PLEASE KEEP IT DOWN.
BE CONSIDERATE.

297
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,189
[loud whispering]
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, TOM.

298
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,191
BELLA'S LOVE FOR EDWARD
IS BEING TESTED.

299
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,793
- BY JACOB?

300
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,094
- MM. NOT EXACTLY.

301
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,261
- THE VOLTURI?
- YES.

302
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,262
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
ALL RIGHT.

303
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,731
I'M GONNA GO DO MY WORK
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM,

304
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,800
'CAUSE YOU GUYS ARE
THE WORST.

305
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,768
- YOU SEEM TENSE, LESLIE.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

306
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,036
- READ TWILIGHT?

307
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,037
- READ TWILIGHT.
HERE.

308
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,306
- YEAH, THANKS.

309
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,274
- SOMETIMES I THINK
SHE'S IN THE VOLTURI.

310
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,244
[laughter]

311
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,280
- GOOD MORNING, KELLY.

312
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,949
- OH, MORNING, LESLIE.

313
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,884
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND I MOVED
MYSELF OVER TO THIS PIPE.

314
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,019
IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE.

315
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,153
- NO PROBLEM.

316
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,254
DID YOU HAVE A NICE NIGHT?
SLEEP WELL?

317
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,823
- MM, IT WAS ALL RIGHT,
CONSIDERING.

318
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:56,924
- PICKED YOU UP SOME COFFEE.

319
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,191
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

320
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,426
WELL, YOU SEEM PRETTY CHIPPER
THIS MORNING.

321
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,794
- I AM, KELLY,

322
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:04,264
BECAUSE I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE.

323
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,999
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID
LAST NIGHT?

324
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,768
- READ TWILIGHT,
AND IT TRANSFORMED YOUR LIFE

325
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,169
AND YOU'RE GONNA PUT IT
IN THE TIME CAPSULE?

326
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,971
- WELL, I READ
THE FIRST TEN PAGES.

327
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,305
I COULDN'T REALLY
GET INTO IT, THOUGH.

328
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,407
MORE OF A HARRY POTTER
GIRL MYSELF.

329
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,876
- WHAT?

330
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,144
- BUT I LOOKED
AT THE INSIDE COVER,

331
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,080
AND I SAW THIS.

332
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,215
DID A LITTLE RESEARCH,
AND LIZ WAVERLY

333
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,084
IS 12 YEARS OLD,
A STRAIGHT "A" STUDENT

334
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,252
AT KING PHILIP MIDDLE.

335
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,254
SHE'S ALSO A MEMBER
OF MANY

336
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,156
TWILIGHT INTERNET
MESSAGE BOARDS

337
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,792
AND I'M GUESSING
YOUR DAUGHTER?

338
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,294
IS THAT WHY YOU DID THIS?

339
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,996
TO IMPRESS YOUR DAUGHTER?

340
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,399
- LIZ'S MOM AND I DIVORCED
A COUPLE YEARS AGO,

341
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,101
AND IT'S BEEN
REALLY HARD ON HER.

342
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,436
AND SHE LOVES TWILIGHT
AND SO...

343
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,272
I READ ABOUT YOUR TIME CAPSULE
AND I THOUGHT

344
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,940
THAT IF I COULD SOMEHOW
CONVINCE YOU

345
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:49,309
TO GET IT IN THERE,
I'D BE A BIG HERO.

346
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,378
- THAT'S REALLY SWEET.

347
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,347
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME YOU WERE
DOING THIS FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

348
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,216
- I DIDN'T WANT
TO DRAG HER INTO IT.

349
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,185
I'M SORRY.
THIS IS A MISTAKE.

350
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,220
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT TWILIGHT
IN THE TIME CAPSULE.

351
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,155
- [sighs]

352
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,224
I THINK WE SHOULD PUT TWILIGHT
IN THE TIME CAPSULE.

353
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,926
- LESLIE, NO.

354
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,795
WE DON'T NEGOTIATE
WITH WEIRDOS.

355
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,930
- YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED TO,
"A PERFECT ENCAPSULATION

356
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,164
OF LIFE IN PAWNEE"?

357
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,200
- WELL, FOR THAT GUY,
LIFE IN PAWNEE

358
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,335
IS HIM AND HIS DAUGHTER
READING THAT BOOK.

359
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,270
BESIDES, I CAN GET SHAUNA
ON BOARD.

360
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,139
IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT
HUMAN INTEREST STORY.

361
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,908
- UH, IF THIS GETS OUT,

362
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,442
EVERY TIME YOU WANT
TO DO ANYTHING,

363
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,277
SOME GUY'S GONNA COME
INTO YOUR OFFICE

364
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,946
AND HANDCUFF HIMSELF
TO A PIPE.

365
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,182
- WELL, YEAH,
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

366
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:32,419
THEN WE SHALL
BRING THE PIPE TO THEM.

367
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:33,486
- OH, NO.

368
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,256
- OH, YES.

369
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,557
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

370
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,793
- CRACKPOT CONVENTION.

371
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,229
- SO THAT'S WHAT
TODAY'S FORUM IS FOR.

372
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,031
WE'RE GONNA HEAR SUGGESTIONS
FROM EVERYONE,

373
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,533
AND THEN WHICHEVER ITEMS
WE GENERALLY AGREE ON

374
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:49,402
WILL GO INTO THE TIME CAPSULE.

375
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,471
PLEASE REMEMBER THIS IS
A GOVERNMENT PROJECT,

376
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,374
SO WE NEED TO REFRAIN
FROM CORPORATE PROMOTION

377
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,809
AND RELIGIOUS ITEMS.

378
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:56,709
WHO'D LIKE TO START?

379
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,279
- I THINK WE SHOULD
PUT IN THE BIBLE.

380
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,281
- GREAT.

381
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,253
- EDUARDO.

382
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,387
HI, EDUARDO.

383
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,923
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

384
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,424
JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE DATING MY SOUL MATE

385
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,127
DOESN'T GIVE ME ANY RIGHT
TO BE A JERK TO YOU.

386
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,262
UM, I PROMISE FROM NOW ON,

387
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,965
I'M JUST GONNA BE...
SUPER NICE TO YOU.

388
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,266
- THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.

389
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,333
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

390
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,135
- UM, WHAT, UH,
CDs ARE THOSE?

391
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,470
- MOUSE RAT.
MY BAND.

392
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,372
IT'S OUR LATEST ALBUM.
YEAH.

393
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,307
YOU, UH, LIKE MUSIC?
WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO?

394
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,143
- THE SMITHS.
UGH. VERY DEPRESSING.

395
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,244
- APRIL'S MAKING YOU LISTEN
TO THAT?

396
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,980
SHE'S REALLY
INTO THAT INDIE STUFF.

397
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,382
I'M MORE OF
A DAVE MATTHEWS GUY MYSELF.

398
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,317
- DAVID MATTHEWS!
CRASH INTO ME!

399
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,087
- YES!
I LOVE THAT SONG.

400
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,155
HERE YOU GO, HERE.
TAKE ONE. CHECK US OUT.

401
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,491
WE'RE AMAZING, SO LET ME KNOW
HOW MUCH YOU LIKE US.

402
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,959
- YEAH, GRACIAS.

403
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,928
- THAT MEANS "THANK YOU"?

404
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,030
- YES.
- NAILED IT.

405
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:53,233
- SO WE HAVE ONE VERY MOVING
CASE FOR TWILIGHT.

406
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,568
ANYONE ELSE?
GREAT.

407
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,404
TWO PEOPLE FOR TWILIGHT.
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

408
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,040
I'M MARCIA LANGMAN
FROM THE SOCIETY

409
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,541
FOR FAMILY STABILITY
FOUNDATION.

410
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,111
THIS BOOK CONTAINS
PAGAN CREATURES

411
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,179
AND STRONG SEXUAL OVERTONES.

412
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,949
THERE ARE GIRLS QUIVERING.

413
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,284
THERE ARE BOYS STARING DEEPLY
INTO GIRLS' EYES

414
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,220
AS THEY QUIVER AND SO FORTH.

415
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,222
THERE REALLY IS A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF QUIVERING.

416
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,924
IT IS ANTI-CHRISTIAN,

417
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,959
IT IS PRO-QUIVERING,
AND THE GOVERNMENT

418
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,660
HAS NO BUSINESS PROMOTING IT.

419
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,595
[applause]

420
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,164
- I TOTALLY DISAGREE.

421
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,899
- WELL, NOW WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE
FOR TWILIGHT.

422
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,334
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

423
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,436
I'M WITH THE NATIONAL
CIVIL LIBERTIES ASSOCIATION.

424
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:33,306
THAT BOOK ACTUALLY CONTAINS
OVERT CHRISTIAN THEMES,

425
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,009
AND AS SUCH, HAS NO BUSINESS
BEING ASSOCIATED

426
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,477
WITH ANY GOVERNMENT PROJECT.

427
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,215
- SO TOO CHRISTIAN
AND NOT CHRISTIAN ENOUGH?

428
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,550
DO YOU SEE THE IRONY HERE?

429
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,185
NO? OKAY.

430
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,621
UH, DONNA, WHY DON'T YOU
PUT A QUESTION MARK

431
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:49,957
NEXT TO TWILIGHT?

432
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,025
- NO!
YOU PROMISED!

433
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,660
- YOU PROMISED?
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

434
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,228
- WAIT, IT'S NOT A QUESTION
OF FAIRNESS.

435
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,097
IT'S SECUL--
- GO BACK TO RUSSIA, COMMIE!

436
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,431
- HEY, YOU GO BACK TO RUSSIA!

437
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,067
AND YOU GO BACK TO WHEREVER
YOU CAME FROM!

438
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,001
- WHY WOULD I GO TO RUSSIA?

439
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,469
I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN TRAVELING TO RUSSIA.

440
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:03,937
CAN I JUST SAY THAT?

441
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:06,673
- UM, WHO ELSE?

442
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,408
- I WOULD LIKE TO INCLUDE
MY FAVORITE BOOK:

443
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,710
CRAZY FROM THE HEAT:
THE DAVID LEE ROTH STORY.

444
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,911
- WELL, I THINK IF WE'RE
GONNA BE ADDING A BOOK

445
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,214
TO THE TIME CAPSULE,
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE TWILIGHT.

446
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,984
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT TWILIGHT.

447
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,485
WHY IS THIS ONLY ABOUT
HIS FAVORITE BOOK?

448
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,187
I WANT MY FAVORITE BOOK
IN THERE.

449
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,989
- OKAY, I HAVE AN IDEA.

450
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,224
TWO TIME CAPSULES.

451
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,360
ONE THAT TOTALLY ENCAPSULATES
WHAT'S HAPPENING

452
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,129
RIGHT NOW IN PAWNEE
IN THIS MOMENT IN TIME

453
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,597
AND THE OTHER ONE
THAT'S JUST FOR ITEMS

454
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,233
OF PERSONAL SIGNIFICANCE,
LIKE TWILIGHT.

455
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,068
- NO TWILIGHT!

456
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,736
- YES, TWILIGHT!

457
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,238
- [sighs]

458
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,673
- HEY.
- HEY.

459
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,142
THANKS FOR COMING.

460
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,611
- I ONLY HAVE A SECOND.
I HAVE TO GET TO WORK.

461
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,147
- BELLA'S GOING
ON HER FIRST HUNT.

462
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,051
I JUST DON'T GET
WHY YOU BROKE UP WITH ME.

463
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,052
IS IT 'CAUSE
I'M NOT COOL ENOUGH

464
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,487
LIKE THE NORMAL KIDS COMPARED
TO THE VAMPIRES?

465
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,490
IS IT AN EDWARD-BELLA-JACOB
TYPE SITUATION

466
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,493
WHERE YOU LIKE ME BUT THERE'S
SOMEONE ELSE YOU LIKE MORE?

467
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:04,998
- UH, IT'S NOTHING
TO DO WITH TWILIGHT.

468
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:08,035
IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT.
OKAY?

469
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,536
- WELL, WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

470
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,371
IF WE STAYED TOGETHER,
YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE

471
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,372
JUST DUMPED ME FOR RON.

472
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,008
- ACTUALLY, THAT'S THE REASON.

473
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,277
I BELIEVE YOU WHEN YOU SAY
THAT YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE

474
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,579
WITH WENDY ANYMORE,
BUT YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT COOL

475
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:20,713
WITH HER DATING RON.

476
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,049
YOU TALK ABOUT IT CONSTANTLY.

477
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,017
- WELL, I CAN'T HELP IT,
OKAY?

478
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:26,486
I MEAN, HE'S SO MANLY,
AND HE'S MY BOSS.

479
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,089
IMAGINE IF YOUR BOSS
WAS ANGELINA JOLIE,

480
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,024
AND THEN ONE DAY,
SHE JUST STARTED

481
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:31,991
DATING YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND.

482
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,060
WOULDN'T THAT FREAK YOU OUT
A LITTLE BIT?

483
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:36,063
- WELL, NOT IF I HAD GREAT
NEW BOYFRIEND, DUMBASS.

484
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:38,065
LOOK, TOM, I LIKE YOU.

485
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,633
YOU'RE REALLY CUTE
AND YOU'RE FUNNY

486
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,236
AND YOU'RE SMALL ENOUGH
FOR ME TO THROW YOU AROUND.

487
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,538
SO IF YOU EVER WORK
THROUGH THIS,

488
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,574
THEN GIVE ME A CALL.

489
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,815
- MY GRANDMOTHER LIVED
IN PAWNEE FOR 60 YEARS,

490
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,818
AND I WANT TO PUT HER ASHES
IN THE TIME CAPSULE.

491
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:03,123
- MY CAT, TURNIP,
WAS THE GREATEST CAT EVER,

492
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,658
AND I'D LIKE TO PUT HIS ASHES
IN THE TIME CAPSULE.

493
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,761
- FOR THE LAST TIME,
AND I WON'T SAY THIS AGAIN,

494
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:12,099
THERE WILL BE NO HUMAN
OR FELINE ASHES

495
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,833
IN EITHER ONE OF
THE TIME CAPSULES.

496
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,768
- EXCEPT FOR TURNIP.

497
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,804
[begins chanting]
EXCEPT FOR TURNIP.

498
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,306
- NO CHANTING.

499
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,640
- LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE WORLD

500
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,242
IS GOING TO BE LIKE
IN 50 YEARS.

501
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:26,179
WE COULD ALL HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT
FROM DISEASE OR THE FLU.

502
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,115
- SO WHAT'S YOUR SUGGESTION?

503
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,183
- I DON'T KNOW.

504
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,851
I'M JUST SCARED.

505
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,286
- HEY.

506
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,322
[speaking Spanish]

507
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,324
- [speaking Spanish]

508
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:48,535
- [playing guitar]

509
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,536
- ANDY!

510
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,871
- I GOT TWO MICROPHONES,
A FOUR-TRACK RECORDER,

511
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,407
AND EVERY BASS TAB
TO DAVE MATTHEWS EVER.

512
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,608
- VAMOS!
- WE'RE GONNA JAM

513
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,876
FOR, LIKE, NINE HOURS.
IS THAT COOL?

514
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,145
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

515
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,313
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

516
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:02,149
NOW, WHY SHOULD
THE BILL OF RIGHTS

517
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,817
BE IN THE OFFICIAL
TIME CAPSULE

518
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:07,154
BUT THIS PAINTING
OF MY DOG

519
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,689
IS IN TIME CAPSULE SEVEN?

520
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,725
- WELL, I THINK
PET PAINTINGS/ASHES

521
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,594
ARE IN TIME CAPSULE FOUR.

522
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,397
- NO, THAT'S BASEBALL CARDS.

523
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,166
- NO, BASEBALL CARDS

524
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,901
ARE IN TIME CAPSULE NINE:
CHILDHOOD MEMORABILIA.

525
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,735
- HONESTLY,
TWILIGHT COULD GO

526
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,737
IN ALMOST ANY OF THESE
CATEGORIES.

527
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,506
- OH, SHUT UP, KELLY!

528
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,774
- MAKE ME, BOB!

529
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,477
- OKAY, LET'S TAKE
A TEN-MINUTE BREAK!

530
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,179
OH, GOD.

531
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:35,248
THIS TIME CAPSULE'S
TEARING THIS TOWN APART.

532
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,115
YOU'RE LEAVING SOON.

533
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,884
CAN I BLAME IT ON YOU
IN THE PRESS?

534
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,587
- SURE.

535
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,522
WELL, I GOT TO SAY,
I THINK IT'S KIND OF IMPRESSIVE.

536
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:43,823
I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF TOWNS.

537
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,558
USUALLY PEOPLE DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANYTHING.

538
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:46,893
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

539
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,895
THESE PEOPLE ARE WEIRDOS,

540
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:52,765
BUT THEY'RE WEIRDOS
WHO CARE.

541
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,436
- EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE.

542
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,539
I REALIZE THINGS HAVE GOTTEN
A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL,

543
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,541
AND THAT'S BEN'S FAULT,
AND HE'S SORRY.

544
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,376
BUT I HAVE AN IDEA,
AND IF YOU LIKE IT,

545
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,313
I THINK WE CAN END THIS
RIGHT NOW.

546
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,914
"DEAR PAWNEE OF THE FUTURE,

547
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,949
"CONGRATULATIONS.

548
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,851
"YOU HAVE FOUND
A TIME CAPSULE

549
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,886
"THAT WAS BURIED
OVER 50 YEARS AGO.

550
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,789
"WE WANTED TO INCLUDE
A COLLECTION OF ITEMS

551
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:17,790
"THAT WOULD BEST REPRESENT

552
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,727
"WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE IN OUR TOWN
AT THAT MOMENT.

553
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,530
"INSTEAD, YOU'LL FIND
ONLY ONE ITEM--

554
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:27,234
"A VIDEO RECORDING
OF A PUBLIC FORUM WE HELD

555
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,470
"IN ORDER TO DETERMINE
JUST WHAT THOSE ITEMS WOULD BE.

556
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,605
"THIS IS TRULY
WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE--

557
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,542
"A LOT OF PEOPLE
WITH A LOT OF OPINIONS

558
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,610
"ARGUING PASSIONATELY
FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVED IN.

559
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,713
"SO ENJOY WATCHING IT.

560
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,450
"A-ASSUMING YOU STILL HAVE
ELECTRICITY.

561
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,519
"AND SORRY ABOUT THE WEIRD
BLANK GAP IN THE MIDDLE.

562
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:47,820
"A MAN NAMED JERRY GERGICH

563
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,557
"SCREWED UP
THE RECORDING SOMEHOW.

564
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,792
"HE HAD ONE JOB TO DO.

565
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:56,329
SINCERELY,
PAWNEE OF THE PAST."

566
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,471
- IS EDUARDO COMING?

567
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,973
- NO. HE WENT BACK
TO VENEZUELA.

568
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,310
- OH, THAT SUCKS.
HE'S A REALLY GOOD BASSIST.

569
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,412
I WAS ACTUALLY
STARTING TO LIKE HIM.

570
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,780
- I KNOW.

571
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,748
THAT'S WHAT MADE ME
START TO HATE HIM.

572
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,722
- HEY, "NICE" AND "BAND"
TOTALLY WORKED.

573
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,896
- HAVE YOU ENJOYED
YOUR TIME WITH ANDY?

574
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,831
- YEAH, HE'S GREAT.

575
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,833
AND HE TOLD ME
HOW GREAT YOU ARE,

576
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,868
AND HE TOLD ME THAT

577
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,338
I WOULD BE CRAZY
TO LET YOU GET AWAY.

578
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,906
- HE DID, HUH?
- HE DID.

579
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,308
AND ALSO...

580
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,709
THERE IS A PRETZEL STAND
OVER THERE

581
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,412
THAT SERVES, LITERALLY,
THE BEST PRETZEL I'VE EVER HAD.

582
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,714
WOULD YOU LIKE ONE?
- ABSOLUTELY.

583
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,883
- HEY, GUYS.
- HEY, TOM.

584
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,752
- TOM!
- LISTEN, I'VE NEVER

585
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,754
SEEN THIS BEFORE,
SO I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT

586
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,989
IF NO ONE LIKE TALKED
OR TEXTED OR ANYTHING.

587
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,691
[movie begins]

588
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,293
- OH!

589
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,432
HI!

590
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,867
- HI, LESLIE.
THANKS FOR SETTING THIS UP.

591
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,802
- DUDE, WHAT DID I JUST SAY?
- HEY, I WAS THE GUY

592
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:09,902
WHO INTRODUCED YOU TO--
- HOW 'BOUT YOU SHUT UP?
