1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,736
- OKAY, EVERYBODY, THE HARVEST
FESTIVAL IS TOMORROW.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,772
AND I AM SO PROUD
OF ALL OF YOU.

3
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,507
YOU'VE WORKED SO HARD.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,509
YOU'RE AMAZING.
SO I HAVE A SURPRISE.

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,580
AND IT IS POSSIBLY
THE BEST THING

6
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:13,781
TO POTENTIALLY EVER HAPPEN

7
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,349
TO ANYONE ANYWHERE

8
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,185
IN THE HISTORY
OF THE UNIVERSE.

9
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:18,219
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

10
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,787
THE WORLD-FAMOUS
LI'L SEBASTIAN.

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,089
- WHAT?
- YES!

12
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:22,390
- NO WAY!
[all laugh, exclaim]

13
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:25,793
- LI'L SEBASTIAN?
OH, MY GOD!

14
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,262
- OH, SNAP!

15
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:29,563
- IT'S REALLY HIM!

16
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,365
- THAT'S REALLY
LI'L SEBASTIAN?

17
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,300
- YES, THIS IS HIM!
- THAT IS LI'L SEBASTIAN?

18
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,135
- TAKE MY PICTURE,
TAKE MY PICTURE, PLEASE.

19
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:37,171
- WELL DONE, LESLIE.
WELL DONE!

20
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:38,539
- I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D GET TO MEET HIM!

21
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,807
- WOW.

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,409
- LI'L SEBASTIAN
MADE HIS DEBUT

23
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,511
AT THE LAST HARVEST FESTIVAL
IN 1987,

24
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,846
AND HE WAS
AN INSTANT PHENOMENON.

25
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,980
THAT WEEK,

26
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,750
HE WAS THE EIGHTH MOST
PHOTOGRAPHED OBJECT IN AMERICA.

27
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,420
SO SUCK IT, THE ALAMO.

28
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:53,421
- I'M SITTING NEXT TO
LI'L SEBASTIAN.

29
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:54,788
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

30
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,857
- RIGHT NOW, I'M HERE,
LI'L SEBASTIAN'S RIGHT THERE.

31
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,227
- WOW!
[laughter]

32
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,596
- WOW. SO WHAT AM I MISSING?
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THIS PONY?

33
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,199
- HE'S NOT A PONY, BEN.
HE'S A MINI HORSE.

34
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:06,033
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

35
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,801
- WELL, THEN,
WHY IS HE SO FAMOUS?

36
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:10,271
DOES HE--DOES HE--
DOES HE DO SOMETHING?

37
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,572
WHAT DOES HE DO?

38
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,174
- YEAH, HE DOES
BEING A MINI HORSE,

39
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,608
AND HE DOES IT
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

40
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:18,546
- SON, THIS HORSE HAS AN
HONORARY DEGREE FROM NOTRE DAME.

41
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,514
- WE ALL NEED
TO BE VERY CAREFUL, OKAY?

42
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,117
REMEMBER,
THIS LITTLE GUY IS 25 NOW.

43
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:25,253
AND HE HAS CATARACTS
IN BOTH EYES

44
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,520
AND HE HAS
SEVERE ARTHRITIS.

45
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:27,888
JERRY IS GONNA LOOK AFTER HIM.
- YES, I AM.

46
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,291
WE ARE BOTH ON
THE SAME DIABETES MEDICATION.

47
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,692
ARE YOU MY GLUCOTROL BUDDY?

48
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,327
ARE YOU? HUH?

49
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:34,862
- ISN'T IT AMAZING?

50
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,730
- YEAH,
I'VE JUST GOT TO BE HONEST.

51
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,433
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

52
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:40,501
- GET OUT.

53
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,504
[triumphant music]

54
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:51,545
*

55
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,922
- HMM.

56
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,192
- OKAY, COULDN'T YOU
PUT SUE'S SALADS HERE?

57
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,659
- ON DEEP FRIED BOULEVARD?

58
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:06,860
- IT'S JUST...

59
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,463
THERE'S SO MANY JUNK FOOD PLACES
AND ONLY ONE SALAD STAND.

60
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:12,266
- WELL, WE WANT TO MAKE MONEY,
NOT MAKE PEOPLE HATE THEMSELVES.

61
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,203
- SALADS ARE MY LIFE.
- OF COURSE. I'M SORRY.

62
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,370
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT WE'LL DO?

63
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:17,471
WE'LL MAKE SUE'S SALADS

64
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,607
THE OFFICIAL HEALTHY CHOICE
OF THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

65
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,844
- WOW. THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU.
- OF COURSE. SURE.

66
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,513
NOBODY'S GONNA COME
TO YOUR STUPID BOOTH ANYWAY.

67
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,580
- I'M SORRY?

68
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,316
- WELL, THE HARVEST FESTIVAL
IS THE BIGGEST THING

69
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,717
I'VE EVER DONE IN MY CAREER,
AND IF IT FAILS,

70
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,952
THE PARKS DEPARTMENT
WILL BE ELIMINATED.

71
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,721
THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING BIG.

72
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,956
SEVEN DAYS,
OVER 30 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS,

73
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,528
50,000-PLUS VISITORS,
AND FOUR HOSPITALITY KIOSKS.

74
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,464
GOD, I GOTTA STOP
ENDING ON THAT BORING THING.

75
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,633
CLOWNS!

76
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,802
- UH, WELL, NO, YOU CANNOT
SELL HOME-BREWED WATER.

77
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,605
AND AGAIN, NO, I WOULD NOT
LIKE TO TASTE IT.

78
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,673
BUT THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

79
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,342
APRIL, WHO'S NEXT?

80
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,344
- MAN, YOU ARE JUST
KNOCKING THESE OFF.

81
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,547
YOU'RE LIKE A NINJA CROSSED
WITH A JEDI OR SOMETHING.

82
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,550
- YOU'RE LIKE A NERD MIXED
WITH A DORK OR SOMETHING.

83
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,418
- TOM, STAR WARS
IS NOT THAT NERDY.

84
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:06,387
- [nerdy voice]
NO, STAR WA IS NOT THAT NERDY.

85
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,655
- IT'S NOT;
EVERYONE'S SEEN IT.

86
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:08,722
- [nerdy voice]
EVERYONE'S SEEN IT.

87
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:09,723
- EVERYONE.
- THIS GUY'S HERE.

88
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,559
- HEY, KEN.
- HI, LESLIE.

89
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,794
- THIS IS BEN AND TOM.
- THAT'S A DOPE BOLO.

90
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:14,962
- THIS IS KEN HOTATE.

91
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,531
HE IS THE TRIBAL LEADER
OF THE WAMAPOKE.

92
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,835
- AH! WALLAHO!

93
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,238
- I JUST SAID,
"HELLO, HONORED GUEST."

94
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:25,673
ALTHOUGH,
LITERALLY TRANSLATED,

95
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,876
IT MEANS, "MAY YOU BE BLESSED
WITH A MILLION POSSUMS."

96
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,544
THE WAMAPOKE USED
TO USE POSSUM AS CURRENCY.

97
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:34,348
- OH. WELL,
WALLA-HEY NONI-KOTI.

98
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,850
- NO, DON'T. OKAY.
HAVE A SEAT.

99
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,253
KEN, I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE.

100
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:41,989
AND JUST LET ME SAY
THAT WE REALLY TRIED.

101
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:44,592
- I'M SORRY, LESLIE,
BUT THIS IS A BIG ONE.

102
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,993
I'M UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE.

103
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,628
I'M GONNA NEED
TO FORMALLY ASK YOU

104
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:48,929
TO, UH, MOVE THE CARNIVAL.

105
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,532
- I'M SORRY?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

106
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,535
- THE CARNIVAL IS ON THE SITE
OF THE BATTLE OF INDIAN HILL,

107
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,671
WHICH WAS AN EPIC SEVEN-DAY
BATTLE THAT THE WAMAPOKE LOST.

108
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,940
DUE TO THE FACT THAT
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY WEAPONS.

109
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,843
- DURING THE BATTLE,
93-YEAR-OLD CHIEF WAKOTE

110
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,612
WAS SHOT 102 TIMES
BY THE CAVALRY.

111
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,880
- DID HE DIE?

112
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,782
- [whispers]
YES.

113
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,584
- AND THIS MOMENT
WILL BE COMMEMORATED

114
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:11,585
FOR THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS

115
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,288
WITH SHOOTING GALLERIES
AND FRIED DOUGH STANDS.

116
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:15,389
- KEN, I UNDERSTAND.

117
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:16,424
BUT THIS IS
THE ONLY PLACE IN TOWN

118
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,459
THAT'S BIG ENOUGH
TO HOUSE THE CARNIVAL RIDES.

119
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:19,627
PLUS, YOU KNOW,
WITH PAWNEE'S HISTORY

120
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,729
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO NOT BE OFFENSIVE.

121
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,832
THIS IS A MAP OF ALL THE
ATROCITIES THE PAWNEE SETTLERS

122
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:29,069
INFLICTED UPON
THE WAMAPOKE INDIANS.

123
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,539
THE ATROCITIES
ARE IN BLUE.

124
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,441
WE PUT UP
A MEMORIAL PLAQUE,

125
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,377
AND WE HAVE A WAMAPOKE EXHIBIT
IN THE HISTORY TENT.

126
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,879
WE'RE REALLY TRYING.

127
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,481
- I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND YOU.

128
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,882
I MEAN, I REALLY DO.

129
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,652
BUT THIS IS
SACRED BURIAL GROUND.

130
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:47,755
AND I JUST HOPE
THAT THE SOULS OF MY ANCESTORS

131
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,792
DON'T PUT A CURSE
ON THIS FESTIVAL.

132
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,662
THERE ARE TWO THINGS
I KNOW ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE.

133
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,364
THEY LOVE RACHAEL RAY,

134
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:59,433
AND THEY ARE TERRIFIED
OF CURSES.

135
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,536
- SO, YEAH, SO JUST
BRING IT RIGHT OVER THERE,

136
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,537
AND WE'LL BE GOOD.
THANKS.

137
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:04,872
- HEY.
- HEY.

138
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,608
- UM, SO SOMEBODY,
I DON'T WANT TO SAY WHO--

139
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,809
IT WAS TOTALLY ME--

140
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:12,680
GOT SWEETUMS TO DONATE ANOTHER
15 COTTON CANDY MACHINES.

141
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,448
- GREAT. SWEETS!
- YEAH, YEAH. YEAH.

142
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:17,518
- AW, TAKE THAT, CURSE.
- TAKE THAT, CURSE.

143
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,353
[both imitating gunshots]

144
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:20,354
- OUCH, OUCH, OUCH!
- RIGHT IN THE CHEST, OH!

145
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:21,355
- OW, OW, OW!

146
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,624
- BAZOOKA!
- YOU'RE DEAD!

147
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,059
- BAZOOKA!
[both laughing]

148
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,696
THAT WAS FUNNY.
- UGH! GET A ROOM.

149
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,564
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

150
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,533
UM, SO, GUYS, FOCUS UP.

151
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,703
JOAN CALLAMEZZO IS COMING BY
WITH A CAMERA CREW

152
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,805
FOR AN EXCLUSIVE
LAST-MINUTE WALK-THROUGH

153
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,907
OF THE HARVEST FESTIVAL
BEFORE WE OPEN TOMORROW.

154
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,675
SO EVERYTHING
NEEDS TO BE PERFECT.

155
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,844
JOAN IS ALWAYS
LOOKING FOR A SCANDAL.

156
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,413
SHE'S LIKE
AN EAGLE-EYED TIGER.

157
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:46,947
- EAGLE-EYED TIGER,
NEW BAND NAME, I CALL IT!

158
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,616
- SO EVERYBODY
GATHER AROUND.

159
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,551
LET'S GRAB HANDS.
- I DON'T HOLD HANDS.

160
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,987
- OKAY, YOU'RE ALL AMAZING,
WONDERFUL PEOPLE.

161
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,557
AND I REALLY WANT YOU
TO HAVE FUN TODAY

162
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,792
AND NOT FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT
IF ONE THING GOES WRONG,

163
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,060
WE'RE ALL GOING
TO LOSE OUR JOBS.

164
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,562
- THAT'S NOT INSPIRING.
- OKAY.

165
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,396
LET'S GO
GET 'EM, EVERYBODY!

166
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,498
ANY CONCERNS,
ADDRESS THEM TO RON.

167
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:05,933
- YES!
[applause]

168
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,135
- THE ADVANTAGE
OF BEING LESLIE'S BOSS

169
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,970
IS THAT SHE DOES EVERYTHING
HERSELF,

170
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,573
AND THERE ARE
NEVER ANY PROBLEMS.

171
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,408
WHICH MEANS,
FOR THE NEXT WEEK,

172
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:18,912
I CAN SIT IN A LAWN CHAIR AND
READ THIS BOOK ABOUT OLD BOATS.

173
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:22,950
EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK.

174
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:27,821
- HEY, WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO YOU AND THE BIONIC MAN?

175
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,691
- CHRIS?
HE BROKE UP WITH ME.

176
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,926
BUT HE DID IT SO NICELY THAT I
DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE HE DID IT.

177
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,996
- I'VE DONE THAT
TO MULTIPLE MEN.

178
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,598
HOW YOU DOING?
YOU DOING OKAY?

179
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,667
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ASKING.
IT'S BEEN TOUGH, YEAH.

180
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,602
YEAH, TWO DAYS AGO
I WAS SOBBING

181
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,136
AT A PIZZA BUFFET
AND THEY ASKED ME TO LEAVE.

182
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,573
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT
SOME DOG ADOPTION WEB SITES.

183
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,941
BOUGHT $700 WORTH OF CANDLES
FROM ANTHROPOLOGIE.

184
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,042
I DID THIS TO MY HAIR.

185
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,513
YOU KNOW, YOUR BASIC,
BOTTOMING-OUT KIND OF STUFF.

186
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,081
- YEAH.

187
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,485
NORMALLY, PEOPLE TELL YOU
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS.

188
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,587
I'M GONNA RECOMMEND YOU
BOTTLE THAT NOISE UP.

189
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,723
- THAT'S WHAT
MY MAILMAN SAID.

190
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,058
- MUAH-MUAH-MURDER.

191
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,627
MURDER THE MOST MELONS.

192
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,496
SHAQUILLE SHOWERED SHAME
ON SHAKIRA'S SHEETS.

193
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,230
- HELLO, JOAN.
- HELLO, LESLIE.

194
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,734
LOOKS LIKE A VERY
IMPRESSIVE FESTIVAL.

195
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,703
BUT WE'LL SEE.

196
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,705
WE'LL SEE.

197
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:18,706
- YOU REMEMBER BEN?
- HI.

198
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,841
- IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

199
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,176
- LET'S GET STARTED.
- OKAY.

200
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,212
- NOW, THE FESTIVAL IS SPREAD
THROUGHOUT THE TOWN.

201
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,047
BUT THE CENTERPIECE
IS THE CARNIVAL.

202
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,851
AND OVER HERE IS
INDIANA'S LARGEST CORN MAZE.

203
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:31,752
- AH.

204
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,187
IS THAT PAWNEE CORN
OR EAGLETON CORN?

205
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,490
- PAWNEE CORN,
AND IT'S ORGANIC.

206
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:38,826
OVER HERE WE HAVE
OUR BEAUTIFUL FERRIS WHEEL.

207
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,662
- AH, BEAUTIFUL.
BUT DEADLY.

208
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,096
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
THIS GIANT WHEEL OF DEATH

209
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,565
WAS INSPECTED?

210
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,166
- ACTUALLY,
TWICE IN THE LAST WEEK.

211
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,803
AND EVERYTHING
IS 100% UP TO CODE.

212
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:52,540
- HOW MANY OF THESE CARNIES
ARE ILLEGALS?

213
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,742
- NONE.
THEY'RE ALL U.S. CITIZENS.

214
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,745
OVER IN THIS BOOTH, INDIANA
BASKETBALL LEGEND LARRY BIRD'S

215
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,680
84-YEAR-OLD
AUNT TILDA WILL BE

216
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,815
SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS
FOR TWO HOURS ON THURSDAY.

217
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,784
- YOU GOT TILDA?
- YEAH.

218
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,053
- OH.
- WE GOT TILDA.

219
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,622
- BUT THE REAL COUP
IS OVER THERE.

220
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,724
LI'L SEBASTIAN.

221
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:13,126
- ARE YOU [bleep]
KIDDING ME?

222
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,564
YOU GOT LI'L SEBASTIAN?
- SEE FOR YOURSELF!

223
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,599
- OH, WOW.
HE IS SO ADORABLE.

224
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:19,399
- THANK YOU, JOAN.

225
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,569
LI'L SEBASTIAN
ISN'T BAD EITHER.

226
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,037
- TOM!
- HOW ARE YOU?

227
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,606
- GOOD.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

228
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,608
HOLD ON A SECOND.
[squeaking]

229
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:28,642
DID YOU GET
YOUR BREASTS DONE?

230
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:31,178
YOU LOOK AMAZING.
- YES, THANKS FOR NOTICING.

231
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,312
- JOAN, LISTEN TO ME.

232
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,948
THIS HARVEST FESTIVAL,
IT'S GONNA KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF.

233
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,617
AND WHEN IT DOES,
I'M GONNA BE THERE

234
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,085
TO GIVE YOU A FOOT MASSAGE...
TO COMPLETION.

235
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,653
[both laughing]
- OKAY!

236
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,789
- GOOD LORD.

237
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,293
- GOD, I SWEAR, IT'S ALMOST
LIKE THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO WIN.

238
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,629
- WELL, YOU'D BETTER PRACTICE.

239
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,230
YOU GOTTA WIN ME A TEDDY BEAR.

240
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,700
- I'M GONNA WIN YOU
A MILLION TEDDY BEARS.

241
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,736
- WELL, I WANT
A BILLION TEDDY BEARS.

242
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,705
- WELL,
THAT'S A LITTLE UNREALISTIC.

243
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,607
THIS IS A HARD GAME.

244
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,775
TWO MILLION.

245
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,076
- DEAL.

246
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,812
- ALL RIGHT.

247
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,321
- HEY, I LOVE YOU.

248
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:18,626
- DUDE, SHUT UP!
THAT IS AWESOME SAUCE!

249
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:22,996
- YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD BOY.

250
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,998
- JERRY, STOP BOTHERING
LI'L SEBASTIAN.

251
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,834
LESLIE SAID I SHOULD
WATCH HIM FOR A LITTLE BIT.

252
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,903
- PERFECT, I'VE GOTTA GO
GET HIM A TAIL SCRUNCHIE.

253
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,005
- HI, LI'L SEBASTIAN,
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

254
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,708
"PRETTY GOOD. JUST EATING
SOME HAY, HANGIN' OUT.

255
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,844
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?"
UH, MY NAME'S TOM.

256
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,712
"OH, YOU'RE REALLY
WELL-DRESSED.

257
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,614
"I LIKE HOW YOU GOT YOUR
T-SHIRT OVER YOUR DRESS SHIRT.

258
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:42,315
YOU LOOK WAY COOLER
THAN EVERYBODY ELSE HERE."

259
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:45,185
LI'L SEBASTIAN, COME ON.
YOU'RE MAKING ME BLUSH.

260
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,854
MOST PEOPLE LOOK
AT LI'L SEBASTIAN

261
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,388
AND THEY SEE
A FAMOUS MINI HORSE.

262
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,224
I SEE AN ADVERTISING
OPPORTUNITY FOR MY CLUB,

263
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,393
THE SNAKEHOLE LOUNGE.

264
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,829
WOW, THAT IS A SHOCKINGLY
HUGE MINI HORSE ERECTION.

265
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:56,964
[horse grunts]

266
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,932
- I DON'T THINK
I'M BEING UNPROFESSIONAL

267
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,001
WHEN I SAY THAT
I REALLY WAS HOPING

268
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,369
FOR MORE TAWDRY SCANDALS.

269
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,704
- WELL...

270
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,072
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR
FRIEND BEN, HERE?

271
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,641
WE ALL KNOW HIS STORY,
ONE OF FAILURE.

272
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,176
REMIND US
OF THAT FAILURE.

273
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,912
- WELL, UH, YOU KNOW,

274
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,747
WHEN I WAS
AN 18-YEAR-OLD MAYOR,

275
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:16,083
I TRIED TO BUILD
A WINTER SPORTS COMPLEX

276
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,819
CALLED "ICE TOWN,"
AND IT BANKRUPTED THE CITY.

277
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:19,820
- YIKES.

278
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,222
- I WAS ALSO SHORTSTOP
ON MY JV BASEBALL TEAM.

279
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,290
NO ONE EVER BRINGS THAT UP.

280
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,659
- AND NOW YOU'RE
INVOLVED WITH THIS.

281
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,661
DO I SMELL ANOTHER
DISASTER, HOPEFULLY?

282
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,697
- LOOK, JOAN,
THIS FESTIVAL,

283
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,865
THANKS TO THE TIRELESS
EFFORTS OF LESLIE KNOPE,

284
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,001
IS GOING TO BRING PEOPLE
NOTHING BUT HAPPINESS.

285
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,169
NOT EVEN I COULD
SCREW THAT UP.

286
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,072
- I'M A REPORTER,
NOT YOUR THERAPIST.

287
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,808
- SO ANYTIME SOMEONE
TAKES A PICTURE OF HIM,

288
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,776
THE SNAKEHOLE'S LOGO
IS IN IT.

289
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,111
AM I A GENIUS OR WHAT?

290
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:49,049
- HEY, TOM.
WHERE'S LI'L SEBASTIAN?

291
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:52,686
- UH, SOMEBODY
LEFT THE GATE OPEN

292
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,987
AND HE GOT OUT, JERRY!

293
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,023
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

294
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,024
- UNBELIEVABLE.

295
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,892
ANOTHER IN A LONG STRING
OF MISERABLE FAILURES.

296
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,160
YOU LOST LI'L SEBASTIAN!

297
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,229
- I WASN'T EVEN HERE!
- EXACTLY.

298
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,764
HOPEFULLY I CAN GET YOU
OUT OF THIS MESS

299
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,699
THAT YOU
AND NO ONE ELSE CAUSED.

300
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,100
- YOU WERE THE ONE
WATCHING HIM.

301
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,269
- WELL, IT'S A POOR WORKMAN
THAT BLAMES HIS TOOLS.

302
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,470
YOU LOOK FOR HIM.

303
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,373
I'M GONNA GO TELL EVERYONE
WHAT YOU DID.

304
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,243
- HARVEST FESTIVAL STARTS
AT 9:00 A.M. TOMORROW MORNING,

305
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,311
AND AS FAR AS THIS
REPORTER IS CONCERNED,

306
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,213
IT'S WELL WORTH YOUR TIME.

307
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,150
- COME ON DOWN, EVERYONE.
IT'S GONNA BE SWEET.

308
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,452
- IT PAINS ME TO SAY THIS,
BUT GREAT JOB HERE.

309
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:29,890
- THANK YOU.

310
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,792
THAT WENT WELL.
- YEAH, IT DID.

311
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,394
TAKE THAT, CURSE!
- TAKE THAT, CURSE!

312
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,496
- SORRY, WHAT IS THIS
ABOUT A CURSE?

313
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,731
- HMM?
- CURSE?

314
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:39,032
- WHAT? WHAT, NOTHING.
- NO.

315
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,101
- DID YOU--
- LESLIE! LESLIE.

316
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,070
IT'S LI'L SEBASTIAN.
HE'S GONE.

317
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,972
JERRY LET HIM ESCAPE
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

318
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:48,508
- KEEP THOSE CAMERAS UP.
WE'VE GOT A NEW INTRO TO DO.

319
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,210
GOTCHA.

320
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,746
LET'S GO AHEAD,
LET'S GET SOME SHOTS

321
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,748
OF CHIPPED PAINT
AND CRYING BABIES.

322
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:55,749
HOW ABOUT SOME OF THOSE
SPOOKY TRAFFIC LIGHTS?

323
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:56,784
OKAY, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

324
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,320
- IS IT REVENGE
OF THE WAMAPOKE,

325
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,023
AN INCOMPETENT GOVERNMENT
RUN AMOK,

326
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:07,360
OR PROBABLY SOMETHING EVEN WORSE
THAN ANY OF THOSE THINGS?

327
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,363
WHILE IT SEEMED EVERYTHING
WAS READY FOR TOMORROW,

328
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:14,868
THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS
EXACTLY AS THEY MAY SEEM.

329
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,469
NAILED IT.

330
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,406
- UH, THIS IS BAD, RIGHT?
- YES, THIS IS BAD.

331
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:23,110
THIS IS LIKE A POOP TORNADO.
THIS IS LIKE A POOPNADO.

332
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,978
- OKAY, WELL, GROSS,

333
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:27,280
BUT WE CAN HANDLE A LITTLE
BAD PUBLICITY, LESLIE.

334
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,916
- THIS IS
WAY WORSE THAN THAT.

335
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,250
THIS IS A HUGE
GOVERNMENT PROJECT,

336
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,484
AND IT'S ALREADY
A LIGHTNING ROD.

337
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,821
AND THEN YOU ADD
THE WAMAPOKE CONTROVERSY.

338
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:34,922
DOUBLE LIGHTNING ROD.

339
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,490
- PLUS WE LOST THAT LITTLE PONY.
- IT'S A MINI HORSE!

340
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,959
AND THAT'S
THE THIRD LIGHTNING ROD.

341
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,060
TRIPLE LIGHTNING ROD!

342
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,962
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE CURSE,
QUADRUPLE LIGHTNING ROD.

343
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,397
THIS IS A CLASSIC
FOUR-ROD DISASTER.

344
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,933
- OH, RIGHT, ONE OF THOSE.

345
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:46,834
- GOD, NOW ALL
THE VENDORS ARE GONNA BAIL.

346
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:47,334
AND THE TICKET SALES
ARE GONNA GO DOWN.

347
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,468
- WAIT, I'M SORRY.

348
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,503
BUT DO PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
REALLY BELIEVE IN CURSES?

349
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:54,007
- PAWNEE IS AN INCREDIBLY
SUPERSTITIOUS TOWN.

350
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,076
A TRAVELING MAGICIAN
CAME THROUGH ONE TIME,

351
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,811
AND HE PULLED A RABBIT
OUT OF A HAT,

352
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:01,348
AND THE MOB BURNED HIM
AT THE STAKE FOR BEING A WITCH.

353
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,251
THE YEAR WAS 1973.

354
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,253
- WE ARE REALLY
UP A CREEK HERE.

355
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,821
WHAT THE HECK
ARE WE GONNA DO?

356
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:09,422
- YOU MEAN,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

357
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,490
- NO, WHAT ARE DO GONNA YOU?

358
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,025
- WHAT AM DO GONNA I?

359
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,027
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION,
JERRY.

360
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:16,864
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE LEFT LI'L
SEBASTIAN WITH THIS GENTLEMAN?

361
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,265
- OKAY, YOU WERE THE ONE
WATCHING HIM.

362
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,267
- WELL, APPARENTLY I'M NOT
GONNA GET ANY WORK DONE.

363
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,468
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

364
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:25,272
- MAYBE LI'L SEBASTIAN GOT UPSET
BECAUSE HE TRIED TO SHARE

365
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,607
HIS TRUE FEELINGS WITH SOMEONE
AND THEY DIDN'T RECIPROCATE.

366
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,942
- THAT'S NOT BAD.

367
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,012
OR MAYBE A BALLOON
POPPED SOMEWHERE,

368
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:35,883
AND IT SCARED HIM,
SENT HIM RUNNING OFF.

369
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,919
- OKAY. TOM, JERRY, CHECK THE
FIELD BEHIND THE PARKING LOT.

370
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,921
- I DON'T WANT TO GO
WITH JERRY.

371
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,422
HE'S THE ONE
WHO DELIBERATELY CAUSED ME

372
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,456
TO ACCIDENTALLY
LET THE HORSE OUT.

373
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,158
JERRY'S FAULT.

374
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:48,228
all: JERRY'S FAULT,
JERRY'S FAULT, JERRY'S FAULT!

375
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,362
- STOP IT.
- HANG ON.

376
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:50,230
ALL OF YOU LISTEN TO ME.

377
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,233
THAT MAGNIFICENT
LITTLE HORSE IS LOST,

378
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,268
AND HE'S PROBABLY SCARED,
AND IT'S OUR FAULT.

379
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,904
TOM, JERRY, YOU GET ALONG.

380
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,571
ANDY, APRIL,
CHECK THE CORN MAZE.

381
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,142
- GOOD IDEA.
HORSES LOVE MAZES, COME ON!

382
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,143
- HEY, LESLIE?

383
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,411
THIS BIG, BEEFY DUDE

384
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,445
JUST CAME
INTO THE FIRST AID TENT

385
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,513
BECAUSE HE WAS DEHYDRATED.

386
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,447
AND THEN A REPORTER CAME IN

387
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,117
AND ASKED IF IT
WAS BECAUSE OF THE CURSE.

388
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,551
- [gasps] NO COMMENT.
DID YOU SAY, "NO COMMENT?"

389
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,386
YOU GOTTA SAY, "NO COMMENT."
- I DID.

390
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,155
- AH, GOOD.
ANN, YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

391
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,423
BEAUTIFUL ANN.
ALL RIGHT.

392
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,391
WELL, UM,
JUST TREAT HIM AND RELEASE HIM

393
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,093
AND THEN DON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYONE ABOUT ANYTHING

394
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,094
FOR THE REST OF THE MONTH.

395
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,996
- OKAY.
- OKAY. RUN, ANN, RUN!

396
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,932
- LESLIE?
- YEAH?

397
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,099
- YOU GOTTA SEE THIS.

398
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,234
- THE FACT IS,
THIS CARNIVAL

399
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:31,004
IS BEING HELD ON TOP OF
AN ANCIENT WAMAPOKE BURIAL SITE.

400
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,405
- MUCH LIKE THE HOUSE
IN THE MOVIE POLTERGEIST.

401
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:33,406
- EXACTLY.

402
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,343
I SPOKE TO LESLIE KNOPE
OF THE PARKS DEPARTMENT

403
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,411
ABOUT MOVING THE CARNIVAL,
AND SHE REFUSED.

404
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,448
- WE DO HAVE EXCLUSIVE
ANIMATION OF THAT EVENT.

405
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,415
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

406
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,585
- OH, I LOVE THESE THINGS.

407
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,987
SORRY.

408
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,089
- [speaking virtual language]

409
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,524
- [speaking virtual language]

410
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:58,065
- [chanting]

411
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,699
- [moaning]
- WHOA.

412
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,970
- AAH, AAH, AAH!

413
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,671
- IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

414
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,539
- PERD...
- NONE OF THAT HAPPENED.

415
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,541
- THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

416
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,277
- HMM.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

417
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,412
WHAT WE DO IS
WE MOVE THE SHOOTING GALLERY.

418
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,480
THAT SEEMS TO BE
THEIR BIGGEST PROBLEM.

419
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,182
MAYBE THAT WILL
MAKE THEM HAPPY.

420
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,516
- CHECK BACK IN
WITH NEWS CHANNEL 4,

421
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:20,320
NUMBER ONE
IN CURSE COVERAGE.

422
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,489
- YOU KNOW WHERE I WOULD HIDE
IF I WAS A HORSE?

423
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,092
THE MERRY-GO-ROUND.
THINK ABOUT IT!

424
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,127
YOU JUST STAND STILL RIGHT
NEXT TO ALL THE OTHER HORSES,

425
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,561
AND NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW.

426
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,230
IT'S THE PERFECT CRIME.

427
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,565
- OH, MY GOD.
I'M GONNA GO LOOK BY MYSELF.

428
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,469
- HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU SEEM SUPER NOT HAPPY.

429
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,239
- I'M FINE.
OH, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

430
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:44,677
I MIGHT BE GOING
TO VENEZUELA TOMORROW. FOREVER.

431
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,580
- YOU'RE NOT FINE.

432
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,283
LUDGATE, I CAN READ YOU
LIKE THE BACK OF A BOOK.

433
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,718
SOMETHING IS UPSETTING YOU.

434
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,586
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO AHEAD
AND TELL ME WHAT IT IS?

435
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,522
- I'M NOT UPSET.
- [sighs]

436
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,525
- I'M GREAT. SEE?

437
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,426
- APRIL!

438
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,595
- NO, I'M NOT MAD AT HIM.
HE'S GREAT.

439
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,231
I AWESOME SAUCE ANDY.

440
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,299
- APRIL!

441
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,136
OH, MY GOD.

442
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:12,172
THIS MAIZE IS LIKE A MAZE.

443
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,576
- LOOK LEFT.
LOOK RIGHT.

444
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,111
YEAH, OKAY.

445
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,280
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S SICKER,
ME OR YOUR BODY.

446
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,382
- YOU AREN'T SICK.
- I'M NOT?

447
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,451
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
CHECK OUT MY ABS.

448
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,418
- ARE YOU EXPERIENCING
ABDOMINAL PAIN?

449
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,587
- EVERY DAY AT THE GYM.

450
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,489
- EW.
- FEEL.

451
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,626
- OH.

452
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,128
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TONIGHT?

453
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,729
- I'M PREPPING
THE MEDICAL TENT.

454
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,431
- I MEAN, IN TERMS OF US.

455
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,800
- I THINK
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PASS.

456
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,036
- YOUR LOSS.

457
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,642
- ARE YOU GONNA HIT THAT?
- HIM?

458
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,512
HE ISN'T EXACTLY
BOYFRIEND MATERIAL.

459
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,614
- WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A BOYFRIEND?

460
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,784
USE HIM, ABUSE HIM,
LOSE HIM.

461
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,619
THAT'S THE MEAGLE MOTTO.

462
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,488
GRAMMIE MEAGLE
TAUGHT ME THAT.

463
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,557
SHE DIED AT THE AGE OF 84,

464
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,594
SANDWICHED BETWEEN
TWO 30-YEAR-OLDS.

465
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,296
- YOU GUYS SEE ANYTHING?
- NO.

466
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,797
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
DID YOU FIND HIM?

467
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,566
- YEAH, JERRY.
HE'S RIGHT HERE IN MY POCKET.

468
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,136
- DAMN IT. OKAY, HE CAN'T
HAVE GONE THAT FAR.

469
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,771
HE'S GOT THE LEGS OF TOM,
THE ENDURANCE OF JERRY,

470
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,440
AND THE DISEASES OF JERRY.

471
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,175
GROUND MISSION FAILED.

472
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,513
WE NEED A BIRD'S EYE VIEW.

473
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,515
- YOU WANT ME TO CLIMB
ON TOP OF THE FERRIS WHEEL?

474
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,551
- WE'RE EXTREMELY CONFIDENT
THAT THERE'S NO CURSE

475
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,853
AND EVERYONE'S GONNA HAVE
A GREAT TIME TOMORROW, OKAY?

476
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,623
- WOW, FIRST ICE TOWN,
NOW THIS.

477
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,691
BAD LUCK REALLY
FOLLOWS YOU AROUND, HUH?

478
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,561
- OKAY, I'D LIKE
TO START BY ADDRESSING

479
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,164
SOME OF THE FALSE RUMORS
ABOUT THE FESTIVAL.

480
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,499
FIRST OF ALL,
WE HAVE PLENTY OF FOOD.

481
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,535
THERE'S NO FOOD SHORTAGE.

482
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,337
THERE ARE NOT,
AS ONE REPORTER SUGGESTED,

483
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,139
DOZENS OF ESCAPED CONVICTS

484
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,673
MEANDERING
AROUND THE CARNIVAL.

485
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:57,410
AND AT NO TIME WAS ANY
PARKS DEPARTMENT WORKER QUOTE,

486
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,212
"FEASTING
ON PETTING ZOO ANIMALS."

487
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,614
- YOU WERE IN CHARGE
OF WATCHING A TINY HORSE

488
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:02,882
AND YOU FAILED.

489
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,618
- LOOK, I'M ONLY
GONNA SAY THIS ONCE.

490
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,855
WHAT IF LI'L SEBASTIAN
IS ON THIS FERRIS WHEEL?

491
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,158
- HOW ABOUT YOU ONLY
SAY THAT NEVER?

492
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,326
- LESLIE,
HOW BIG OF A DISASTER

493
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,463
WILL THIS BE,
ON A SCALE OF 9 TO 10?

494
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,731
- IT WILL NOT BE A DISASTER.
IT WILL BE A SUCCESS.

495
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,534
AND I WANT
TO LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT,

496
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,470
IN AN ATTEMPT TO BE SENSITIVE
TO OUR WAMAPOKE FRIENDS,

497
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:26,473
WE HAVE MOVED THE SHOOTING
GALLERY, PER THEIR REQUEST.

498
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,408
SO, YES, PERD?

499
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,510
- YEAH, THE STATEMENT THAT
THIS REPORTER HAS IS A QUESTION.

500
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:33,146
WILL THAT BE ENOUGH
TO LIFT THE CURSE?

501
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,716
- PERD, YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
THAT THERE'S NO SUCH--

502
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,152
- OH, MY GOD.
- MAN.

503
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,721
- CRAP ON A SPATULA.

504
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,390
- IT'S THE CURSE.

505
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:44,591
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT IS.

506
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,792
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT IS THE CURSE.

507
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,727
- WAIT,
EVERYONE RELAX, PLEASE.

508
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,462
WE'LL GET THIS
UP AND RUNNING IN NO TIME.

509
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,530
- OH.
- WHOA!

510
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,399
- JERRY, WHAT THE HELL?

511
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,600
- I DIDN'T DO THIS.

512
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,835
- JERRY'S FAULT.
JERRY'S FAULT.

513
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,605
all: JERRY'S FAULT!
JERRY'S FAULT!

514
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,574
- OH, MY GOD.
I CANNOT CATCH A BREAK.

515
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:02,475
- YEAH, WELL,
I'LL HELP YOU OUT.

516
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,610
I'M GONNA GO.
- WHAT?

517
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,611
- I THINK I'M JINXED
OR SOMETHING.

518
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,745
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

519
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,481
- LOOK, YOU WERE TOTALLY FINE
UNTIL I GOT INVOLVED.

520
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,583
SO I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD
PROBABLY JUST GO, OKAY?

521
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,820
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I'M THE CURSE, I THINK.

522
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:14,954
SO I'M GONNA--I'M GONNA--

523
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,357
I'M GONNA GET OUT OF HERE,
ALL RIGHT?

524
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:24,297
- WHEN THEY'RE MISSING
THIS LONG, THEY'RE USUALLY DEAD.

525
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,265
- WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE,
THEN YOU'RE GONNA

526
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,335
HAVE TO ANSWER
TO THE WHOLE TOWN, AND GOD.

527
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,403
- OKAY, YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO LET HIM OUT, TOM, OKAY?

528
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:31,738
NOW STOP TRYING TO BLAME ME.

529
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,840
- JERRY,
CAN YOU PLEASE BE QUIET?

530
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,443
I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF
NOT TALKING TO ANDY.

531
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:39,846
- RON, WILL YOU PLEASE TELL ME
WHY APRIL IS MAD AT ME?

532
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,381
- RON, CAN YOU PLEASE
TELL ANDY--

533
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,250
- ALL OF YOU, BE QUIET!

534
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:46,219
ANDY, SHE'S MAD BECAUSE
YOU SAID "AWESOME SAUCE"

535
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,153
INSTEAD OF
"I LOVE YOU TOO."

536
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,223
APRIL, HE LOVES YOU.
STOP BEING A CHILD.

537
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:52,259
TOM, YOU'RE CLEARLY
AT FAULT HERE.

538
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,794
BLAMING JERRY
WON'T SAVE YOU.

539
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,264
JERRY, WE BOTH KNOW YOU WERE
SHOTGUNNING FUNNEL CAKES

540
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,732
INSTEAD OF WATCHING
LI'L SEBASTIAN.

541
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,269
SO EVERYONE APOLOGIZE
TO EVERYONE ELSE!

542
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,304
- I'M SORRY, TOM.
- I'M SORRY, JERRY.

543
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,305
- I'M SORRY.
- I'M SORRY.

544
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,840
- I DO LOVE YOU.

545
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,909
- YOU DO?

546
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,345
- YEAH.

547
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,582
THAT'S WHAT, YOU KNOW,
MAKES THE SAUCE SO AWESOME.

548
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,487
- AW, JERRY JUST FARTED!

549
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,256
- I'M VERY UPSET.
I GET NERVOUS.

550
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,758
- HEY, LESLIE,
THE GENERATOR'S SHOT.

551
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,728
- NO, I GOT THE TMK-2500

552
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,997
SPECIFICALLY
FOR THE EXTRA CAPACITY.

553
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,800
- WOW, YOU KNOW YOUR STUFF.
YOU SINGLE?

554
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,336
- NOT NOW, ED.
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?

555
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,605
- ALL THOSE TV CREWS
PLUGGED IN AND OVERLOADED IT.

556
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,273
- YOU KNOW, I KNEW IT.
STUPID MEDIA.

557
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,408
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

558
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,310
FREEDOM OF PRESS
IS FOR THE BIRDS.

559
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,912
OKAY, HOW AND WHERE
CAN I GET A NEW ONE

560
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,714
IN, LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW, NOW?

561
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,815
- THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE
IN TOWN

562
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,050
THAT HAS A GENERATOR
THAT SIZE.

563
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,420
- YOU'VE GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

564
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:57,424
THIS FESTIVAL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
MY LOVE LETTER TO PAWNEE.

565
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,926
NOW IT'S JUST TURNED
INTO A NOTE THAT SAYS,

566
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,061
"I WANT TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE."

567
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,697
- SO, YOU NEED
TO BORROW A GENERATOR.

568
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:08,501
- KEN, I'M COMING TO YOU
ON MY KNEES, BEGGING FOR HELP,

569
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:11,304
MUCH LIKE THE EARLY SETTLERS
OF PAWNEE

570
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,472
BEGGED THE WAMAPOKE
200 YEARS AGO.

571
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,307
- AH, BUT THAT WAS--
- A TRICK.

572
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,376
AND OVER 50 WAMAPOKE
WERE SLAUGHTERED, I KNOW.

573
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,710
BUT THIS IS NOT A TRICK.

574
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:21,047
I AM PREPARED TO PUT
THE WAMAPOKE HISTORY EXHIBIT

575
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,482
INSIDE THE CARNIVAL GROUNDS,

576
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,317
RIGHT PAST
THE ENTRANCE TURNSTILE,

577
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:27,620
SO THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT
BEFORE YOU START HAVING FUN.

578
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,088
- HMM, NOW
THAT'S INTERESTING.

579
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,525
- IT'S BEEN REALLY AWESOME
LOOKING AT YOU.

580
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,561
MOST CARNIVAL NURSES
ARE TOTAL GRENADES.

581
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:38,665
- OKAY, YOU'RE ALL SET.
YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

582
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:43,503
OR YOU COULD STAY HERE
AND MAKE OUT WITH ME

583
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,904
UNTIL THE LIGHTS
COME BACK ON.

584
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,573
- OH, HELL YEAH.

585
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,941
- BEAT IT, DONNA.

586
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,977
- AYE, AYE, CAPTAIN.

587
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:54,881
- I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING GOOD FOR THIS TOWN,

588
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,417
AND I'M TRYING
TO SAVE MY FRIENDS' JOBS.

589
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,918
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT HERE?

590
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,954
- A NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE MAKING
A DEAL WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

591
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,691
HEH, WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

592
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:05,925
YOU CAN HAVE
THE GENERATOR, LESLIE.

593
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:06,926
- THANK YOU, KEN.

594
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:07,827
- AND I'LL ISSUE
A STATEMENT

595
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,963
SAYING THAT
THE CURSE HAS BEEN LIFTED.

596
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,965
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

597
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:17,003
- [singing in Wamapoke]

598
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,721
WITH THAT SACRED CEREMONY,

599
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:37,123
THE WAMAPOKE CURSE
HAS BEEN LIFTED.

600

601
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,096

INTENSE STUFF FROM KEN HOTATE.

602

AND IN OTHER GOOD NEWS,
HE GAVE US A SCARE,

603
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,135
BUT HE'S BACK NOW.

604

[cheers and applause]

606
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,079
- WE SPOTTED HIM FROM
THE TOP OF THE FERRIS WHEEL

607
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,515
AT THE CENTER
OF THE CORN MAZE.

608
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,618
AFTER THE POWER CAME BACK ON,
WE WENT AND GOT HIM.

609
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:08,187
IT TOOK US FOUR HOURS
TO SOLVE THAT MAZE.

610
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,889
IT TOOK THE HORSE
15 MINUTES.

611
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,158

JERRY'S STILL OUT THERE.

612

[laughing]

613
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:18,130
I SUPPOSE I OUGHT
TO GO LOOK FOR HIM.

614
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:21,601
RIGHT AFTER I GET
A BRATWURST.

615
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,836
- KNOCK, KNOCK.
HEY, HOT LIPS.

616
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,104
I GOT OUT OF HERE
SO FAST LAST NIGHT,

617
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,507
I WASN'T ABLE TO SCOOP
THEM DIGITS OFF OF YOU.

618
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:33,012
- OH, UM, YEAH. THAT'S BECAUSE
I DIDN'T GIVE THEM TO YOU.

619
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:35,214
- OH, OKAY. RAGE.

620
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,116
WELL, THEN, UH, MAYBE I'LL
SEE YOU AROUND THE HOSPITAL.

621
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,217

I DON'T MEAN TO BRAG,

622

00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:47,026
- BOOM.

625
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,995
- HE WAS REALLY SWEET,
THOUGH.

626
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:52,999
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST GONNA SEE
IF MAYBE HE WANTS TO GRAB SOME--

627
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,000
RIGHT.

628
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,101
