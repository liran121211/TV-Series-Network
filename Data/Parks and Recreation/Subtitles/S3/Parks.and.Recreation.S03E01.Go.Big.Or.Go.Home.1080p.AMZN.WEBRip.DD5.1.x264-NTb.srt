- CUT IT OUT, TOM.

10
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:16,550
- IT NEVER GETS OLD.

THAT'S WHY I'M SO LIVELY
AND COLORFUL.

20
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,401
- AND ANDY DWYER.

21
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:34,535
- UH-OH.
[crash]

22
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:35,769
NAILED IT.

23
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:38,106
- APRIL AND ANDY
LIKE EACH OTHER.

24
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:39,707
BUT ANDY ACCIDENTALLY KISSED

25
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,642
HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND,
ANN PERKINS...

26
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:42,776
- OOH.

27
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,079
- APRIL LEFT.
- APRIL!

28
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:46,280
- AND HE HASN'T
SEEN HER SINCE.

29
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:47,748
IN THE MIDST
OF ALL THIS LOVE,

30
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,318
TWO BLACK HATS RODE
INTO TOWN...

31
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,120
- SCIENTISTS BELIEVE
THAT THE FIRST HUMAN BEING

32
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:52,820
WHO WILL LIVE 150 YEARS

33
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,855
HAS ALREADY BEEN BORN.

34
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,490
I BELIEVE I AM
THAT HUMAN BEING.

35
00:00:56,524 --> 00:01:00,094
- AND THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM
SOME DISTURBING NEWS.

36
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:01,028
- EFFECTIVE TOMORROW MORNING,

37
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,496
THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT

38
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,098
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

39
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,733
- WHAT WILL LESLIE
DO NEXT?

40
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:09,203
WILL APRIL AND ANDY
MAKE UP AND MAKE OUT?

41
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:11,172

- RON...WE'RE BACK.

45
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,117
- BULLY.

46
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,652
- THE BANKRUPT GOVERNMENT
OF PAWNEE

47
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,820
HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN
ALL SUMMER,

48
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,356
SO IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS
OF NO WORK,

49
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,758
NO MEETINGS, NO MEMOS,
NO LATE NIGHTS, NOTHING.

50
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,526
I WOULDN'T WISH IT
ON MY WORST ENEMY.

51
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,628
OH, ROUNDING UP THE TEAM.

52
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,197
SO EXCITING.

I HAVE GOOSEBUMPS.
FEEL.

54
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,170
- AND THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME
PRINCE CHARMING.

00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:43,471
'CAUSE I ALWAYS FIND
THE GLASS SLIPPER

56
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,805
FOR MY CINDERELLA.

57
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:45,906
- THESE ARE WAY TOO TIGHT.

58
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,841
- WELL, THE REAL CINDERELLA
DIDN'T HAVE HIPPO FEET.

59
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,243
- TOM, WE'RE BACK.

- JEREMY!
SUCK IT!

00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,781
BY THE WAY, I'VE BEEN
GIVING AWAY FREE SPORTS BRAS

00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,617
TO THE GIRLS
AT HOT DOG ON A STICK.

64
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,419
- LOOK, WE CAN DANCE
ALL DAY,

65
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,687
BUT IT'S TIME
TO STEP UP.

66
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,922
ARE YOU BUYING
4,000 RUBBER NIPPLES FROM ME

67
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,857
OR NOT?

68
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,226
- DEE, YOU HAVE A VISITOR.

69
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:06,560
- WE BACK?

70
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,661
- WE'RE BACK.

71
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:08,662

00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,567
- JERRY.

00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,768
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
LESLIE.

76
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,837
- THE NIGHTMARE'S OVER, JERRY.
WE'RE GOING BACK TO WORK.

77
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,873
YOU'RE NOT GONNA NEED
THIS ANYMORE.

[splash]

79
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,543
COME ON!

80
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,781
- I CALLED SHOTGUN.
EVERYBODY HEARD ME.

*

83
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,370
- WELL...

84
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:52,773
I AM USUALLY NOT ONE
FOR SPEECHES.

85
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:53,774
SO GOOD-BYE.

86
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,376
- BREAK'S OVER, MOFOS.

87
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,244
OKAY, HERE'S THE SITUATION.

88
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:58,746
WE ARE OPERATING
ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET.

89
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,948
PARK SERVICES
HAVE BEEN SLASHED.

90
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,317
BUT WE ARE ALL STILL HERE.

91
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:04,852
AND WE HAVE A JOB
TO DO.

92
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,455
- MAKE THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST PIZZA.

93
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:08,889
- NO, MAKE THIS TOWN FUN

94
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:09,990
FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVE HERE.

95
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:10,991
- FINE, BUT AFTER THAT,

96
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,593
THE PIZZA IS
OUR TOP PRIORITY.

97
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:13,827
- NO, IT'S NOT.

98
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,396
- WE'RE GETTING PIZZA?

99
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:18,766
- APRIL, HEY.
IT'S ME, ANDY.

100
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:19,833
DWYER.

101
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,970
UH, THIS IS, LIKE,
THE 200TH MESSAGE I'VE LEFT YOU

102
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,805
WITHOUT A RESPONSE.

103
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,673
SO...

104
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,376
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO TELL ME SOMETHING,

105
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,977
I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT IT IS

106
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,613
BECAUSE YOU WON'T
CALL ME BACK.

107
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,648
- IT IS TRULY GREAT
TO SEE ALL OF YOU.

108
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:35,983
HUH?

109
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,751
IT'S GREAT NEWS.

110
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:40,254
OKAY, I HAVE TO RUN.
BEN.

111
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:43,324
- THE BAD NEWS,
WHICH...

112
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,626
I GET TO DELIVER,
IS THIS:

113
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,261
YOUR ONLY WORK
FOR THE TIME BEING

114
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,597
WILL BE EXISTING
PARK MAINTENANCE.

115
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,764
SO THAT JUST MEANS

116
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:51,765
THAT WE'RE
IN MAINTENANCE MODE!

117
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,000
- YEAH!

118
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,935
- JERRY.

119
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,937
- OKAY, SEE, I'VE SPENT
THE LAST FEW MONTHS

120
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,738
BRAINSTORMING,

121
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:58,572
AND I HAVE
SOME REALLY GREAT IDEAS,

122
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,574
AND I PUT THEM
IN MY IDEA BINDERS.

123
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,310
I MEAN, THEY'RE COLOR-CODED,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

124
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,243
- OKAY, ACTUALLY, YEAH.
THERE IS--

125
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,978
THERE IS ONE THING
THAT YOU WILL BE DOING.

126
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,580
APPARENTLY,
IN INDIANA,

127
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:07,881
IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE
A BASKETBALL LEAGUE,

128
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,517
PEOPLE GET VERY UPSET.

129
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,552
AND, QUITE FRANKLY,
THROW THINGS AT YOU

130
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,953
AND CALL YOU NAMES.

131
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,855
LIKE TURD BOY.
I--WHATEVER.

132
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,291
POINT IS, I REINSTATED
YOUTH BASKETBALL.

133
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:18,859
- IT SAYS HERE YOU ONLY HAVE
MONEY FOR TWO TEAMS.

134
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,395
- YEAH, THEY'RE GONNA DEVELOP
A GREAT RIVALRY.

135
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,996
[whistle blows]

136
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,932
- UNDER MY TUTELAGE,
YOU WILL GROW

137
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,334
FROM BOYS INTO MEN.

138
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,936
FROM MEN INTO GLADIATORS.

139
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:32,005
AND FROM GLADIATORS
INTO SWANSONS.

140
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,041
BEHOLD.

141
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,610
THE SWANSON PYRAMID
OF GREATNESS.

142
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:39,413
I'VE BEEN DEVELOPING
THE SWANSON PYRAMID OF GREATNESS

143
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:40,514
FOR YEARS.

144
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:42,850
IT'S A PERFECTLY
CALIBRATED RECIPE

145
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,818
FOR MAXIMUM PERSONAL
ACHIEVEMENT.

146
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,620
CATEGORIES INCLUDE:

147
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,889
CAPITALISM, GOD'S WAY
OF DETERMINING

148
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,958
WHO IS SMART,
AND WHO IS POOR.

149
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,961
CRYING, ACCEPTABLE
AT FUNERALS

150
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,363
AND THE GRAND CANYON.

151
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:57,898
RAGE, POISE,
PROPERTY RIGHTS.

152
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,833
FISH, FOR SPORT ONLY.

153
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,335
NOT FOR MEAT.

154
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:02,936
FISH MEAT IS PRACTICALLY
A VEGETABLE.

155
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,771
HAIRCUTS.

156
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,038
THERE ARE THREE
ACCEPTABLE HAIRCUTS.

157
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,907
HIGH AND TIGHT,

158
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,109
CREW CUT,
BUZZ CUT.

159
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,745
ARE THE SCISSORS BROKEN
IN YOUR HOUSE, SON?

160
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,947
- SO YOU HAPPY
TO BE BACK AT WORK?

161
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,816
- WELL, OUR BUDGET'S
BEEN SLASHED TO ZERO.

162
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,618
I TRIED TO BUY FERTILIZER
THE OTHER DAY

163
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,752
FOR THE SOCCER FIELD.

164
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:20,087
REQUEST DENIED.

165
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,822
WE LITERALLY CAN'T BUY
[bleep].

166
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,791
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.
- NO, I MEAN, LOOK.

167
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,858
WHEN WE WERE KIDS,

168
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:27,060
THE PARKS DEPARTMENT
WOULD DO THESE BIG PROJECTS.

169
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:30,531
WINTER JAMBOREE,
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

170
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,666
IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE FAITH
IN US ANYMORE.

171
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,134
I'M NOT A PAPER-PUSHER,
ANN.

172
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,836
I NEED TO BE OUT
IN THE STREETS,

173
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,405
PLANTING TREES
AND CRACKING SKULLS.

174
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,106
- LESLIE KNOPE.
ANN PERKINS.

175
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,409
HOW ARE MY TWO FAVORITE PEOPLE
IN THIS ENTIRE TOWN?

176
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:42,643
- NOT GOOD, CHRIS.

177
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,877
THERE'S A WHOLE LINE OF PEOPLE
IN MY OFFICE

178
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:44,945
COMPLAINING THAT
ALL THEIR PROGRAMS

179
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,480
HAVE BEEN SLASHED.

180
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:47,681
- YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S TERRIBLE.

181
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,684
IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT?

182
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:51,552
- NO.
- DAMN, SORRY, LESLIE.

183
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,721
ANN, COULD I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

184
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,959
- SO HOW'S IT GOING?
- SAVE IT, OKAY?

185
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,028
I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE
FAITH IN ME

186
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,563
AND MY DEPARTMENT,
AND THAT'S FINE.

187
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:03,864
BUT DON'T EXPECT ME
TO SIT HERE

188
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,032
AND CHIT-CHAT WITH YOU.

189
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,867
- ALL RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH.

190
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,635
- GO THE OTHER WAY.

191
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,970
- BUT I'M JUST GOING
TO THAT--

192
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,739
ALL RIGHT, UH--

193
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,741
- LOOK, I'M VERY FLATTERED.

194
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:14,742
BUT AGAIN,
I DON'T THINK

195
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,410
I SHOULD GO OUT
WITH YOU.

196
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:17,978
- CAN I ASK YOU
WHY NOT?

197
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:18,846
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
WE HAD A GREAT TIME

198
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,114
THE NIGHT YOU GOT DRUNK
AND KISSED ME.

199
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,751
AND YOU DID USE
YOUR TONGUE.

200
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,586
- I JUST DON'T THINK
I'M IN A PLACE

201
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,521
TO GO OUT WITH ANYONE
RIGHT NOW.

202
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,989
- OKAY, WELL,

203
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:29,857
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,

204
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,559
YOU KNOW WHERE
TO FIND ME, ANN PERKINS.

205
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:32,960
LESLIE KNOPE.

206
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,928
- YES.
DID HE ASK YOU OUT AGAIN?

207
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,830
- HE DID, HE DID.

208
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:39,032
HE IS NOTHING
IF NOT PERSISTENT.

209
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,968
AND HOT.

210
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,836
HE'S VER--
HE'S PRETTY HOT.

211
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,837
YEAH, HE'S HOT.

212
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,005
BUT HE'S INTENSE.

213
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,574
BUT HE'S REALLY,
REALLY HOT.

214
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:47,508
BUT HE'S YOUR BOSS.

215
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,042
- OH, MY GOD,
I JUST THOUGHT OF AN IDEA

216
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,644
OF HOW WE CAN SAVE
THE PARKS DEPARTMENT.

217
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:51,979
- GREAT.

218
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:52,746
- LET ME ASK YOU
ONE QUESTION.

219
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,915
WOULD YOU BE COOL
DOING THINGS

220
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:55,983
THAT A PROSTITUTE DOES?

221
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,751
- UH...

222
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:58,986
- MINUS THE MONEY.

223
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,088
- DEFINITELY YES, THEN.

224
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,456
- THANKS, ANN.

225
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,458
- LOOKING SHARP.
BEAUTIFUL.

226
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:06,126
THE BACKBOARD
IS YOUR FRIEND.

227
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,795
[roaring]

228
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,630
- AAAA, BAM!

229
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,998
BOOM!

230
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,801
I'D SAY MY COACHING STYLE
IS CENTERED

231
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:14,902
AROUND FUNDAMENTALS,

232
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,136
WITH AN EMPHASIS
ON FUN.

233
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,905
HEY, WATCH THIS.

234
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,773
GO GET IT!

235
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,076
AND A SECOND EMPHASIS
ON MENTAL.

236
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,012
YEAH, IT CAN BE
HARD WORK,

237
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:25,779
BUT EVERY TIME I LOOK

238
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,715
ONE OF THESE KIDS
IN THE EYES

239
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,017
AND HE CALLS ME COACH...

240
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,253
THAT'S HOW I KNOW
I AGREED TO BE A COACH.

241
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,855
- MOUSE RAT!

242
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,257
- CARNAGE!

243
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,892
- OKAY, GENTLEMEN,
IT'S TIME

244
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,028
FOR THE PREGAME
COIN TOSS.

245
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,863
- THERE'S NO COIN TOSS
IN BASKETBALL.

246
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,264
ARE THOSE WOMEN'S SNEAKERS?

247
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,033
- YES, THEY ARE, RON.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

248
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,802
THEY FIT BETTER.
I GOT AN EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT.

249
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:49,803
AND THE BEST PART IS,

250
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:50,971
NO ONE CAN TELL.

251
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,873
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO THIS.

252
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,876
MATCH POINT,
TOUCHDOWN, ET CETERA.

253
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,011
[whistle blows]

254
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,947
- YEAH, GO MY TEAM.
ALL RIGHT.

255
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,214
- OKAY, I LIKE
WHAT YOU'RE WEARING,

256
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,216
BUT I NEED IT TO BE
300% SEXIER.

257
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,652
DO YOU HAVE ANY
OF THOSE SHIRTS

258
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,587
THAT LOOK WET
ALL THE TIME?

259
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,788
OR--OR, LIKE,
A METAL BIKINI?

260
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,222
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT'S
ALWAYS SEXY?

261
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,958
FINGERLESS GLOVES.

262
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,861
- WHAT ABOUT IF I WEAR
THIS NORMAL, SANE OUTFIT?

263
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:14,728
- YEAH, OKAY,
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO EAT

264
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:16,830
SOMETHING SEXY, THEN,
LIKE A BANANA.

265
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:17,831
- FOR DINNER?

266
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:18,899
- WELL, WHAT'S SEXY FOOD?

267
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,200
ASPARAGUS?

268
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,702
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT'S SEXY?

269
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,604
TURKEY CHILI.

270
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:24,938
- MMM.
- YUM.

271
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,607
- AND HOW, EXACTLY,

272
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,677
AM I SUPPOSED TO CASUALLY STEER
THE CONVERSATION

273
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,278
TOWARDS THE PARKS
DEPARTMENT BUDGET?

274
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,846
- OKAY, IT'S TOTALLY EASY.

275
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,715
TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU BE CHRIS.

276
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,249
I'LL BE YOU.
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE.

277
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,685
- OKAY.
[clears throat]

278
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:38,886
- ANN PERKINS.

279
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,220
YOU ARE WONDERFUL
AND AMAZING,

280
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,822
AND I'M HAPPY
TO BE HERE WITH YOU.

281
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:42,823
- THANK YOU, CHRIS.

282
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,858
I'M WEARING A TUXEDO VEST

283
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,027
WITH NO SHIRT ON
UNDERNEATH.

284
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,961
UH-OH.

285
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,162
- CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?

286
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,164
I LOVE EVERY SINGLE BEVERAGE
IN THE WORLD.

287
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,900
- I WOULD LIKE SOME WINE.

288
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,736
AND, OOPS,
MY VEST POPPED OPEN.

289
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,572
JUST LIKE THE BUDGET
NEEDS TO POP OPEN,

290
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,708
AND YOU NEED TO POUR IT

291
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,743
INTO MY PARKS DEPARTMENT.

292
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,211
- GREAT.

293
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,314
- I AM SO EXCITED
THAT YOU FINALLY AGREED

294
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,882
TO GO OUT WITH ME.

295
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,651
WHAT A MAGNIFICENT
FLIP-FLOP.

296
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:14,021
- YOU'RE A MAGNIFICENT
ASKER-OUTER.

297
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,757
- TELL ME EVERY SINGLE DETAIL
OF YOUR DAY.

298
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,258
I LOVE DATES.

299
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,860
I LOVE CONNECTING
WITH SOMEONE.

300
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,829
I LOVE ENGAGING THEM.

301
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,931
I LOVE BEING SURPRISED
BY THEM.

302
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,065
I HAVE NEVER HAD
A BAD DATE.

303
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,935
THEY'VE ALL BEEN EITHER GREAT
OR PHENOMENALLY GREAT.

304
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,303
NURSES ARE THE MOST
UNDERVALUED MEMBERS

305
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,005
OF OUR SOCIETY BY FAR.

306
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,274
I THINK ALL OF YOU
SHOULD MAKE AS MUCH MONEY

307
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,275
AS THE CEO OF GOOGLE.

308
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,946
- WOW, THANK YOU.
I AGREE.

309
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,380
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

310
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,882
- WHY AM I SO POSITIVE
ALL THE TIME?

311
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,986
- YES, THAT'S EXACTLY
THE QUESTION.

312
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,955
- I WAS BORN
WITH A BLOOD DISORDER.

313
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,189
AND MY PARENTS WERE TOLD

314
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,858
THAT I HAD THREE WEEKS
TO LIVE.

315
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,860
AND HERE I STILL AM,

316
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:56,196
SOME 2,000-ODD WEEKS LATER.

317
00:09:56,229 --> 00:10:02,035
AND I HAVE ENJOYED
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

318
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,336
- I THINK IT'S GOING WELL.

319
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,873
HE'S ACTUALLY
A REALLY NICE GUY.

320
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:06,940
[Leslie on phone]
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

321
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,175
OKAY, SO HAVE YOU ASKED HIM
YET ABOUT THE MONEY?

322
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,643
- WELL, IT'S A DATE,
YOU KNOW?

323
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:10,944
IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO CASUALLY BRING UP

324
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:11,879
THE PARKS BUDGET
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

325
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,080
ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES.

326
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,383
- JURASSIC PARK,
PARKS ARE SO GREAT,

327
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,851
THE PARKS DEPARTMENT
NEEDS MONEY.

328
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:18,819
I JUST DID IT
IN THREE MOVES.

329
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:19,953
- WELL, THEN, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST COME HERE

330
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:20,954
AND DO IT YOURSELF?

331
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,122
- OKAY.
- HOLY CRAP.

332
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,893
- WHAT? CHRIS AND ANN?
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?

333
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,661
- WE ARE ON A DATE.

334
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:28,996
AND IT IS GOING
PHENOMENALLY.

335
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,363
- THANKS, BUT I'LL STAY
FOR JUST ONE DRINK.

336
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,332
I'M SO HAPPY
I RAN INTO YOU

337
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,101
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO SPEAK TO YOU--

338
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,369
- WELL, WELL, WELL.
- BEN.

339
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,672
WHAT A FUN SURPRISE.
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

340
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,207
YOU WERE COMING HERE TONIGHT
ON A DATE.

341
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,275
AND, HEY,
LESLIE IS JOINING YOU

342
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,812
ON THIS WONDERFULLY
ROMANTIC OCCASION.

343
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,179
HOW 'BOUT THAT?

344
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,848
- FANTASTIC.
- IT IS.

345
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,182
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

346
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:50,250
- SURE.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

347
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,085
- I'M JUST CONFIRMING
A SUSPICION I HAD, LESLIE.

348
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,220
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

349
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,354
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS DATE.

350
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,355
- UH-HUH.
- THEY'RE BOTH SO BEAUTIFUL.

351
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,224
THEY PROBABLY JUST WANT
TO SEE EACH OTHER NAKED.

352
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,458
- OKAY, WELL, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

353
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,027
AND YOU'RE NOT THAT GOOD
AT BEING SNEAKY.

354
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,862
- YES, I AM.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

355
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,263
- I'M GREAT AT BEING SNEAKY.
- CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT.

356
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,397
- HEY, YOU GUYS.

357
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,433
LET'S ALL HAVE DINNER
TOGETHER.

358
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,068
THE MORE THE MERRIER.

359
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,070
- GREAT.
- GREAT.

360
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,072
- GOOD JOB, GUYS.
YEP.

361
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,173
ALL RIGHT, ERIC,
TAKING A REST,

362
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,274
OR ARE YOU HURT?

363
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,209
TAKING A REST?

364
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,811
SMART.

365
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:18,879
- DESTROY THEM, GENTLEMEN.

366
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:22,015
FEEL NO SYMPATHY.

367
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,953
- YES, RON SWANSON IS DATING
MY EX-WIFE, WENDY.

368
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,921
BIG DEAL.

369
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:28,922
MY GIRLFRIEND, LUCY,

370
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:30,223
IS THE SEXIEST WOMAN
IN TOWN.

371
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,025
SHE'S CUBAN,
SHE'S GOT TATTOOS,

372
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,193
AND SHE'S INTO ME,

373
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,728
WHICH, AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED,

374
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,264
IS THE SEXIEST QUALITY
A WOMAN CAN HAVE.

375
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,265
- OH, I HAVE AN IDEA.

376
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,200
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE
REALLY FUN AFTER DINNER?

377
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,402
WE SHOULD TAKE A WALK
BY THE POND IN RAMSETT PARK.

378
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,204
- WALKING IN PARKS CAN BE
VERY ROMANTIC.

379
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,073
- YEAH, TOO BAD THE PARK'S
ALWAYS CLOSED, THOUGH.

380
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,208
- OKAY, WELL,
YOU TWO ARE ON A DATE.

381
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:52,412
SO LESLIE AND I
SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING.

382
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,247
- UH, WELL, I'M ACTUALLY
HAVING A GOOD TIME

383
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,248
WITH EVERYONE.

384
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,150
CHRIS?

385
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,786
- OH, ME, TOO.
I'M HAVING A FANTASTIC TIME.

386
00:11:58,819 --> 00:11:59,586
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE TAKE
THIS WHOLE

387
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,088
DATE-PLUS-TWO-
OTHER-PEOPLE THING

388
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,289
UP INTO THE STRATOSPHERE?

389
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,824
- * DON'T STOP

390
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,193

* TILL WE SEE THE SUNLIGHT *

393
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:10,964
- THIS PLACE IS OUTSTANDING.

394
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,265
GREAT CALL, LESLIE KNOPE.

395
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,266
- THANKS.

396
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,069
- LOOK, EVEN BEN'S DANCING.

397
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,506
- THAT'S THE WAY
TO SHOOT THE BALL, CHIGNOLI.

398
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,507
HUSTLE BACK.

399
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,176
[clapping]

400
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,078
[blows whistle]

401
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,147
- UH...

402
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,081
IT'S A FOUL.

403
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:29,983
- WHAT?
ON WHOM?

404
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:30,784
- YOUR TEAM.

405
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:33,120
NUMBER 50.
HE WAS DOUBLE DRIBBLING.

406
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,121
- HE'S ON DEFENSE.

407
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,023
- EXACTLY.

408
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,090
IT'S A TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY,
SO THAT MEANS

409
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,959
ANDY'S TEAM THROWS
THE BALL

410
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,093
FROM THE STRIPEY THING.

411
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,128
LET'S GO.

412
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,996
- THE STRIPEY THING?

413
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,799
[hip-hop music]

414
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,469
*

415
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,204
- HEY, THERE.

416
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,973
HOW'S IT GOING?

417
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,008
- GREAT, THANKS.

418
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,009
- CAN I BUY YOU
A DRINK?

419
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:58,545
- OH, I'M VERY FLATTERED,

420
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,513
BUT THIS IS MY
STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS DATE,

421
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,215
ANN PERKINS.

422
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,051
- OH, HI.

423
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,019
- HI.
- SORRY.

424
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,454
- OH, NO PROBLEM.

425
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,556
IN FACT, LET ME BUY
ALL OF YOU A DRINK

426
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,891
FOR BEING
SO WELCOMING TODAY.

427
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,025
WAITER.

428
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:17,397
- I THINK I MAY
ACTUALLY LIKE CHRIS.

429
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,598
- ON THE HOUSE, LESLIE.

430
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,868
- OH, THANK YOU.

431
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,870
I'M SORT OF A GAY HERO.

432
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,873
LAST YEAR, I MARRIED
TWO PENGUINS AT THE ZOO,

433
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:26,874
AND IT TURNED OUT
THEY WERE BOTH GAY.

434
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,441
- PENGUIN WEDDING.
- MM-HMM.

435
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,244
- THAT'S CUTE.
- IT WAS SO CUTE.

436
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,479
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT HOW
CUTE IT WAS.

437
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,981
WHY DON'T YOU THINK
I SHOULD HAVE THE MONEY?

438
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,482
- GOOD LORD, REALLY?

439
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,850
LOOK.

440
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,051
WHEN I WAS 18,

441
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:41,054
AND I BECAME MAYOR
OF MY HOMETOWN,

442
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,923
I USED EVERY
LAST DOLLAR WE HAD

443
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,992
TO OPEN A GIANT
WINTER SPORTS COMPLEX.

444
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,059
CALLED IT ICETOWN.

445
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,895
- AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT,
AND EVERYONE LOVED IT.

446
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:48,896
- UH, YEAH, KINDA.

447
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,063
IT WAS NEVER COMPLETED,

448
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:52,332
AND I GOT IMPEACHED.

449
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,200
NEWSPAPER HEADLINE WAS,

450
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,603
"ICETOWN COSTS ICE CLOWN
HIS TOWN CROWN."

451
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:57,637
- YUCK.

452
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,973
- THEY WERE BIG INTO RHYMES.

453
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,374
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

454
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:02,609
I THINK ICETOWN
SOUNDS GREAT.

455
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:03,911
AND THE POINT IS,

456
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,479
AT LEAST YOU TRIED
SOMETHING.

457
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,181
[whistle blows]

458
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,950
- FOUL!
[blows again]

459
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,284
FOUL ON NUMBER THREE

460
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,986
FOR TAKING A NUMBER TWO
ON NUMBER FOUR.

461
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,187
[Andy laughing]

462
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,288
[blows whistle]

463
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:16,423
ROUGHING THE PASSER.

464
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,925
DOUBLE DRIBBLING.
THAT'S A FOUL.

465
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,993
THAT'S A FOUL FOR TOUCHING
THE BASKETBALL.

466
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,161
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT IT?

467
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,329
NOTHING.
YOU FOULED.

468
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,463
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

469
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,098
OKAY.

470
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,299
YOU'RE EJECTED.
YOU'RE EJECTED.

471
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,634
[whistle blowing]

472
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,636
OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER
THERE, RON?

473
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:30,637
NO PLAYERS LEFT?

474
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,573
YAY, ANDY'S TEAM!

475
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,242
LOOK AT 'EM GO!
- COME ON.

476
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,444
NOW YOU'RE OPENLY
CHEERING FOR THE OTHER TEAM?

477
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,179
PUT MY BOYS BACK IN.
- YOU MADE ME THE REF.

478
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,280
DEAL WITH IT.

479
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,614
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
TAKE THIS UNIFORM OFF.

480
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,583
- HEY, HEY.
- YOU DON'T DESERVE TO WEAR IT.

481
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,451
[whistle blowing]

482
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,653
- RON'S EJECTED
FOR MOLESTING THE REF.

483
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:47,587
- OH, YEAH?
I'M EJECTED?

484
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,989
- YES, YOU ARE.
- TOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

485
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:49,923
- I'M EJECTING YOU.

486
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,624
YOU'RE EJECTED, TOO.
EVERYONE'S EJECTED.

487
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:52,625
- OH, YEAH?
SHE'S EJECTED?

488
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,626
- YEAH.

489
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,531
- RRRRAAAAGH!

490
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,533
- GO AHEAD, GO.

491
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,569
WELL, THAT'S A FORFEIT.
ANDY'S TEAM WINS.

492
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,937
- NO WAY!

493
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:06,039
WE WON!
OH, MAN!

494
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,674
EAT IT!
HA, HA, HA, HA!

495
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,377
[all chanting]
ANDY, ANDY, ANDY!

496
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,512
YEAH!

497
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,948
AH-HA-HA!
YES!

498
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:16,683
I DEDICATE THIS VICTORY
TO APRIL LUDGATE.

499
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:17,684
IT FEELS GOOD.

500
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,287
AND IT FEELS STICKY.

501
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,055
FROM THE GATORADE.

502
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,991
- WE'RE BARELY ABLE
TO FUNCTION.

503
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,093
WE COULD REALLY USE
THAT MONEY.

504
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,627
- BUT YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE

505
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,162
I'M IN SUCH A GOOD MOOD,

506
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,563
OR BECAUSE OF THE CHARMING
ANN PERKINS,

507
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,465
BUT I AM GOING
TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THAT.

508
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,467
- REALLY?
THAT'S GREAT.

509
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:35,468
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

510
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:36,703
LET'S BOOGIE.

511
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:37,704
- MISSION ACCOMPLISHED?

512
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:41,141
- UH-OH.

513
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,142
- YEAH.

514
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:46,279
THERE'S A MISSION, UH,
THAT ANN HAD THOUGHT OF.

515
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,314
IT WAS BOTH
OF OUR IDEAS,

516
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,681
BUT IT WAS MOSTLY ANN'S.

517
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,750
WE...

518
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,752
I HAD MENTIONED TO ANN
THAT IT WOULD BE FUN

519
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,387
IF YOU TWO WENT
ON A DATE.

520
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,488
SO THEN...

521
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,258
YOU COULD, UH,
TALK ABOUT THE MONEY

522
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,495
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE GIVE IT TO ME.

523
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,198
- WOW.

524
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:09,269
I'VE JUST HAD
MY FIRST BAD DATE.

525
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,338
[sadly]
ANN PERKINS.

526
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,077
- NOT THAT SNEAKY.

527
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,686
- APRIL!

528
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,223
APRIL.

529
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,025
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
OH, MY GOD.

530
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:33,660
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M OKAY.

531
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:34,661
I'M DYING TO SEE YOU.

532
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:38,165
I CALLED AND TEXTED YOU,
LIKE, A BILLION TIMES.

533
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,600
- OH, I'M SORRY.

534
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,701
I WAS IN VENEZUELA.

535
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,603
- OH, REALLY?

536
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:44,771
WOW.

537
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,207
[British accent]
ACROSS THE POND.

538
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,708
WOW.

539
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,642
I THOUGHT MAYBE
I WOULDA HEARD FROM YOU

540
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,513
AT LEAST ONCE
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED.

541
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:54,714
ANN KISSING ME?
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THAT.

542
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,815
IT WAS SO STUPID,

543
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,617
AND IT MEANT NOTHING.

544
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,787
- I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT'S TOTALLY FINE.

545
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,489
HEY.

546
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,225
THIS IS MY BOYFRIEND, EDUARDO.

547
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,659
- NO, IT'S NOT.

548
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,096
- Â¿LISTO PARA LONCHE?
- SI.

549
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:10,663
- THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING
TO LUNCH.

550
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,432
- HOW DO YOU SAY
HAVE A GREAT TIME,

551
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,433
DON'T CHOKE ON ANYTHING?

552
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:14,567
- BYE.

553
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,273
- LESLIE ASKED ME
TO DO HER A FAVOR,

554
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:23,276
AND I LOVE HER,
SO I DID IT.

555
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,778
I'M SORRY, AND I'M HERE
TO EAT CROW.

556
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,280
I LIKE YOU A LOT.

557
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,282
LET'S GO OUT AGAIN.

558
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:35,088
- ANN PERKINS.

559
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,524
- BUDGET SOLUTION NUMBER 28.

560
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:42,395
USE GRAZING SHEEP
TO MOW GRASS IN PARKS.

561
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:46,299
NOTE: TIRED SHEEP
COULD BECOME FOOD

562
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,634
OR SWEATERS.

563
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,170
[groans]

564
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,738
- WELL, I GOT MY ANSWER.

565
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,106
ABOUT APRIL.

566
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,474
SHE HATES ME.
YEAH.

567
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,543
AND SHE GOT A BOYFRIEND,
I GUESS,

568
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,810
FROM SOME CITY
IN MEXICO.

569
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,712
SO...

570
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,748
WHAT DO I DO?

571
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:02,615
- OKAY.

572
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,751
WELL, WHEN YOUR BACK'S
AGAINST THE WALL

573
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,654
AND ODDS ARE STACKED
AGAINST YOU,

574
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,722
YOU JUST--
YOU--

575
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,558
YOU SWING THE HARDEST,
DAMN IT.

576
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,692
YOU GO BIG,
OR YOU GO HOME.

577
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,195
AND YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE
THE KIND OF GUY WHO GOES HOME.

578
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,696
- I'M NOT.

579
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:17,830
I DON'T EVEN REALLY
HAVE A HOME.

580
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,332
- GO GET HER, ANDY!
- OKAY.

581
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,501
OKAY, THANKS, LESLIE!

582
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,639
- OKAY, SO WE KNOW THE PEOPLE
WHO RUN THIS GOVERNMENT

583
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:27,707
HAVE NO FAITH IN US.

584
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,342
MY PLAN IS GONNA CHANGE THAT

585
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:30,710
AND BRING THE BUDGET BACK.

586
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,245
AND THE ANSWER'S BEEN
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US

587
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,246
THE WHOLE TIME.

588
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,282
- EW, CHECK YOUR TESTICLES?

589
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,082
- NO, NOT THAT.

590
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,817
ALTHOUGH THAT IS
VERY GOOD ADVICE.

591
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,818
I'M LOOKING AT YOU,
JERRY.

592
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:39,886
NO, WHAT'S GONNA SAVE US

593
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,723
IS RIGHT THERE.

594
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,325
GENTLEMEN, I REALIZE
THAT TIMES ARE TOUGH,

595
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,859
AND THE BUDGET IS TIGHT.

596
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:49,729
BUT IF THE PEOPLE OF THIS TOWN
HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO

597
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,665
BUT SIT IN THEIR HOUSES
AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES,

598
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,767
THEN PAWNEE WILL DIE.

599
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,238
AND WE REFUSE
TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

600
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,373
[whispering]
NOW.

601
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:02,542
THIS TOWN WAS HISTORICALLY
KNOWN FOR TWO THINGS.

602
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:03,843
[Chariots of Fire Theme
playing]

603
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,712
WIDESPREAD OBESITY

604
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:09,516
AND THE ANNUAL
PAWNEE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

605
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,351
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER INDIANA
WOULD COME

606
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,685
AND GAZE IN WONDERMENT

607
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,254
AT HOW FAT
OUR CITIZENS WERE.

608
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,488
AND WHILE THEY WERE HERE,

609
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:16,823
THEY WOULD ALSO ATTEND
THE FESTIVAL.

610
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,492
A FULL WEEK
OF CORN MAZES,

611
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,328
HAYRIDES, FERRIS WHEELS,

612
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,263
PUMPKINS THE SIZE
OF JEEPS.

613
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,299
WE LOST THAT FESTIVAL
A FEW YEARS AGO,

614
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,834
DUE TO ANOTHER ROUND
OF BUDGET CUTS.

615
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,204
AND I PROPOSE
WE BRING THE FESTIVAL BACK.

616
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:32,939
WITH TICKET SALES
AND CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP,

617
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,441
WE'LL EARN ALL
THAT MONEY BACK.

618
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,775
AND BELIEVE ME,
PEOPLE WILL COME.

619
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,277
- WHAT IF THEY DON'T?

620
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,247
- WELL...

621
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,582
THEN YOU ELIMINATE
THE PARKS DEPARTMENT.

622
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,984
- AND YOU GUYS ARE ALL
ON BOARD WITH THIS.

623
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,819
- AYE.
- YES.

624
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,821
- LOOK, WE'RE NOT
JUST PENCIL PUSHERS.

625
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:52,225
WE ARE A REFLECTION
OF THE COMMUNITY.

626
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:55,728
AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN
STRENGTHEN THAT COMMUNITY.

627
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,730
BECAUSE IN THE END,

628
00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:00,433
THE REASON WHY
WE'RE ALL HERE

629
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:03,270
IS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.

630
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:07,440
*

631
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:08,508
- THAT...

632
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,677
LITERALLY...

633
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,746
IS THE MOST MOVING THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

634
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,917
AND A GOOD IDEA.

635
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,918
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

636
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,453
- EXCELLENT.

637
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,555
GREAT, OKAY, SO EVERYBODY,

638
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,690
WE'RE GONNA PARTY HARD
FOR 15 MINUTES.

639
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,427
THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE
OUR FIRST BRAINSTORMING SESSION.

640
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,300
- HELLO, APRIL.

641
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,468
DO YOU LIKE THE FLOWERS?

642
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:36,869
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

643
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,705
- ALL DUE RESPECT, EDUARDO.

644
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,972
YOU SEEM LIKE
A GREAT GUY.

645
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,908
BUT I LIKE APRIL,
AND I'M COMING AFTER HER

646
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,976
WITH EVERYTHING I'VE GOT.

647
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,945
SO DO YOU WANT
TO GO OUT WITH ME?

648
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,048
- NO.

649
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,049
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
SAY YES,

650
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,618
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

651
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:53,453
BECAUSE I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW
TO ASK YOU AGAIN.

652
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,355
AND AGAIN THE NEXT DAY.

653
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,556
AND THE NEXT DAY.

654
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,557
NOT FRIDAY.

655
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,658
I HAVE TO GO VISIT
MY COUSIN.

656
00:20:58,691 --> 00:20:59,992
BUT I WILL BE BACK
AFTER THAT

657
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,661
TO ASK YOU AGAIN.

658
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,696
- [speaking Spanish]

659
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:14,040
AH! YOU SHOULD DO IT.

660
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,975
UH, FOLLOW YOU DREAM.

661
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,378
- OH, MY GOD.
REALLY?

662
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:19,379
THAT'S AWESOME.
