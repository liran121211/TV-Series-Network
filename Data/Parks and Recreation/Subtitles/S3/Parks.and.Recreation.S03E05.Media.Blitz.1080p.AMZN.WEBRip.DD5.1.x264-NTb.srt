00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:06,540
[keys clacking loudly]

2
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,809
- I FOUND THIS TYPEWRITER
NEXT TO THE COURTYARD DUMPSTER--

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,746
AN OLD UNDERWOOD FIVE
WITH ORIGINAL CARRIAGE RETURN.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,315
[dings]
AH.

5
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,717
I TOOK HER HOME,
POLISHED HER UP,

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,788
AND BOUGHT A BRAND-NEW RIBBON
OFF OF ELECTRONICBAY.COM.

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,757
- OKAY, SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO DO SOMETHING.

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,493
I'M GETTING A CLUSTER HEADACHE.

9
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,496
- OH, WHOA, WHOA,
HE'S LEAVING.

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,763
- LET'S GO.

11
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:32,233
I'M GONNA THROW IT AWAY.

12
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,168
NO, I'M NOT.
IT WEIGHS A BILLION TONS.

13
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:35,369
- WHAT IS HE TYPING ANYWAY?

14
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:38,572
- "IF YOU SONS OF BITCHES
TRY TO REMOVE THIS TYPEWRITER,

15
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:41,575
I'LL KILL YOU."

16
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,746
- I'M GONNA TYPE
EVERY WORD I KNOW.

17
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:46,780
RECTANGLE!

18
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,749
AMERICA!

19
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,351
MEGAPHONE!

20
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,087
MONDAY!

21
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:54,622
BUTTHOLE.

22
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,625
[triumphant music]

23
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:05,733
*

24
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,678
- WELL, I HATE TO BE THE BEARER
OF BAD TIDINGS,

25
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,414
BUT THESE INTERVIEWS ARE
MORE IMPORTANT THAN WE THOUGHT.

26
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,683
HARVEST FEST
IS TWO WEEKS AWAY,

27
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,119
AND AWARENESS IS STILL
PRETTY LOW.

28
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:26,520
- BOY, 35%.

29
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,289
- IT'S ACTUALLY 34.2%.

30
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,590
- [robotic voice]
34.2%.

31
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,425
I AM BEN,
THE NUMBERS ROBOT.

32
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,893
- IT'S JUST
AN EXACT, UH, CALCULATION.

33
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,595
- [robotic voice]
IT IS JUST AN EXACT CALCULATION.

34
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,629
- ALL RIGHT.

35
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,531
- SO WE'RE DOING
A HUGE MEDIA BLITZ

36
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,400
TO PUBLICIZE
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL,

37
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,336
AND WE'VE GOT TV,
NEWSPAPER, RADIO,

38
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,473
AND I EVEN CALLED OPRAH.

39
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,375
WELL, I TRIED TO CALL OPRAH.

40
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:48,642
I-I COULDN'T GET HER NUMBER.

41
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,779
I'M PUTTING IT OUT THERE
LIKE THE SECRET...

42
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,682
AND HOPEFULLY SHE'LL CALL ME.

43
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,817
OUR FIRST INTERVIEW
IS AT 93.7 F.M.

44
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,751
WITH CRAZY IRA AND THE DOUCHE.

45
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:01,255
- [imitating DJ]
CRAZY IRA AND THE DOUCHE.

46
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,158
- THEY ARE PAWNEE'S MOST
HILARIOUS DRIVE-TIME RADIO GUYS.

47
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,659
- SO MUCH BETTER THAN
TUBBY TONY AND THE PAPAYA.

48
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:06,794
AM I RIGHT?

49
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,562
- THEY'RE SERIOUSLY SO FUNNY.

50
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:09,897
- IS THIS RIGHT?

51
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,699
- THIS FEELS ALMOST PERFECT,

52
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:15,869
BUT I DON'T THINK YOUR CORE
HAS MAXIMIZED ELASTICITY.

53
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,506
- OKAY, UM, I'LL COME BACK
IF YOU GUYS ARE BEING WEIRD.

54
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,673
- NO, NO, NO, NO!

55
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,509
YOU'RE EXACTLY THE PERSON
THAT I MOST WANT TO TALK TO

56
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:22,810
RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT.

57
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,612
AND LUNGE.
- OH.

58
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,447
HAVE YOU GIVEN MY OFFER
ANY MORE THOUGHT?

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,350
- WHAT EXACTLY WOULD HAPPEN
IF I SAID YES?

60
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,419
- WELL, YOU WOULD WORK
AT THE STATE HOUSE.

61
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,753
YOU WOULD COORDINATE

62
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:33,754
MY PROFESSIONAL
AND PERSONAL SCHEDULE,

63
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,789
AND WE WOULD GIVE YOU
A SMALL RELOCATION FEE

64
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:36,590
FOR YOUR MOVE TO INDIANAPOLIS.

65
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,692
- [softly]
OH, THAT SOUNDS BORING.

66
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,529
[normal voice] BUT I HAVE
NOTHING KEEPING ME HERE.

67
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,564
DO YOU HAVE INTERNET
IN YOUR OFFICE?

68
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,599
- [snaps fingers]
YES.

69
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,535
- [snaps fingers]
FINE. I'LL DO IT.

70
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,736
- THAT IS LITERALLY
THE BEST NEWS

71
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,538
THAT I'VE HEARD ALL DAY.

72
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,441
- UNLIKE APRIL,
I STILL DO NOT KNOW

73
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,476
WHAT MY FUTURE HOLDS
WITH CHRIS,

74
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,412
AND IT'S STARTING
TO BUM ME OUT.

75
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:00,781
I NEED SOME MORE VITAMIN "D."

76
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,683
YEAH.

77
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:06,254
- OH, HEY, CRAZY.
WHAT WAS THAT MEETING ABOUT?

78
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:08,489
- OH, IT TURNS OUT
CHRIS IS MY REAL DAD.

79
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,723
- I THINK YOU'RE LYING.

80
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,659
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT THAT MEETING WAS ABOUT.

81
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,594
YOU CAN'T GO TO INDIANAPOLIS.

82
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,563
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
THAT I CAN DO TO CONVINCE YOU

83
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,598
HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT YOU.

84
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,867
[gasps] TELL ME
YOUR LEAST FAVORITE THINGS

85
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,436
YOU HAVE TO DO EVERY DAY,
AND I'LL DO THEM FOR A MONTH.

86
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,004
- FINE.

87
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,240
IF YOU DO EVERYTHING I HATE
FOR A MONTH,

88
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:28,742
THEN I MIGHT BEGIN TO THINK
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY

89
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:32,380
OF THINKING
ABOUT MAYBE STAYING.

90
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,449
- THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO HEAR.

91
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:38,686
YOU WON'T LIVE
TO REGRET THIS.

92
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,289
- UNLESS ANDY CAN UN-KISS ANN,

93
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,991
THEN I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE
MY MIND.

94
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,759
BUT IF HE WANTS TO TAKE
MY DUMB SISTER

95
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,295
TO HER DUMB DANCE CLASS,

96
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:51,299
THEN I'M NOT GONNA
DUMB STOP HIM.

97
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:54,268
- CRAZY IRA AND THE DOUCHE--
93.7.

98
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:56,704
- YOU KNOW WHY
I'D NEVER BE AN ASTRONAUT?

99
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,707
TWO WORDS--SPACE FARTS.

100
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,543
YOU CAN'T ROLL DOWN
THE WINDOW OF THE SHUTTLE.

101
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,577
AM I RIGHT, FOLKS?

102
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,313
- HOUSTON, WE HAVE A...
[farting]

103
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,548
NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT, NEIL ARMSTRONG?

104
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,718
THAT'S ONE SMALL...
[farting] FOR MAN.

105
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,921
ONE GIANT...
[farting] FOR MANKIND.

106
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,889
ALL RIGHT, SWITCHING GEARS
HERE NOW.

107
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,759
WE GOT LESLIE KNOPE
AND TOM HAVERFART...

108
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,429
[farting] AND, UH, BEN WYATT,
AND THEY'RE IN THE HIZZY

109
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:25,566
TO TALK ABOUT AN UPCOMING EVENT
CALLED THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

110
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,635
- WELL, THE DOUCHE,
IT'S A PAWNEE TRADITION,

111
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,938
AND IT'S WHERE FUN
MEETS AWESOME...

112
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,840
MEETS AGRICULTURE.

113
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,609
AND IT IS GOING TO BE
NEXT MONTH RIGHT HERE IN PAWNEE.

114
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:36,777
AND SPOILER ALERT--

115
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,912
IT'S GONNA HAVE
THE BEST CORN MAZE EVER.

116
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,549
- YOU LOST YOUR VIRGINITY IN
A CORN MAZE, DIDN'T YOU, DOUCHE?

117
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,783
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT,
TO YOUR MOM.

118
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,618
[woman moaning]

119
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,421
- CRAZY IRA,
CLEAN YOUR ROOM!

120
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,790
- THERE'S ALSO
GONNA BE HAYRIDES.

121
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,059
- "HEY, RIDE ME"...IS WHAT
CRAZY IRA'S MOM SAID.

122
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,727
- STOP IT!

123
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,095
[woman moaning]

124
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,798
- CHINA JOE, YOU ARE A POET.

125
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,467
[laughing]

126
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,834
- MY BIRD IS MISSING.

127
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,703
I NEED A PERMIT
TO POST SIGNS.

128
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,406
- OH, LET ME JUST LOOK
FOR THAT FORM.

129
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,808
- THERE'S NO TIME!
HE CAN FLY!

130
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,877
- NINE THINGS
APRIL HATES TO DO.

131
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,413
"NUMBER ONE, RUN
THE PERMITS DESK FOR AN HOUR."

132
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,614
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

133
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,450
I EAT RUNNING THE PERMITS DESK
FOR AN HOUR FOR BREAKFAST.

134
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:18,452
OW, THAT'S--OW.

135
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:19,853
- HENRY, STOP IT.
- OW.

136
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,756
OKAY, HENRY.
CUTE KID.

137
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,859
- ANDY, GOT A SEC?

138
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,829
- YEAH.
- HENRY.

139
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,764
- WHY ARE YOU WORKING
THE PERMITS DESK?

140
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:34,868
AND WHY WAS THAT CHILD
CLUBBING YOUR NUGGETS?

141
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,838
- I'M TRYING TO STOP APRIL
FROM TAKING A JOB WITH CHRIS,

142
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:41,475
SO I'M DOING EVERYTHING SHE
HATES DOING FOR THE NEXT MONTH.

143
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,044
- THAT'S GOING TO WORK?
- SHE SAID IT MIGHT.

144
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,614
BUT IT'S ALL I GOT, MAN.

145
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,883
- GIVE ME THE LIST.

146
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,118
I'LL HELP YOU.

147
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,388
- OH, MY GOD.
THANK YOU.

148
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,158
- YOU GOT IT.

149
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,960
NO, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

150
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,796
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO LOSE APRIL.

151
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,800
I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND
A WORSE ASSISTANT.

152
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,502
- OKAY, THANKS, LESLIE.

153
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,938
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
WE REALLY WANT TO DO TODAY

154
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,742
IS HAVE A CHAT
WITH BEN WYATT HERE.

155
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:15,743
- COME ON, BEN.
- COME ON, BEN!

156
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,778
- I'M MORE OF A BEHIND
THE SCENES KIND OF GUY.

157
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,948
- WELL, IT'S EITHER COME WITH US
OR GET IN THE SPANK CHAIR.

158
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,750
SO MAYBE IT'S TIME
FOR AN INTERVIEW.

159
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,718
COME ON, EVERYBODY,
GIVE HIM A HAND.

160
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,987
- COME ON OVER, BEN.
- OH, YEAH.

161
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,457
SO THIS GUY, BEN WYATT,

162
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,625
WE'RE LOOKING HIM UP
ON ALTAVISTA.

163
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:36,464
HE'S FROM SOME HICK TOWN--
PARTRIDGE, MINNESOTA--

164
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:40,801
AND WHEN HE'S 18,
HE'S ELECTED MAYOR.

165
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,804
[patriotic music]

166
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,739
*

167
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,809
[farting]

168
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,144
- THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S FUNNY.

169
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:53,447
- HE'S 18,
BECOMES THE MAYOR,

170
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,884
AND THEN BLOWS THE WHOLE BUDGET
ON AN ICE-SKATING RINK.

171
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:57,718
CITY GOES BANKRUPT.

172
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,688
[explosion]
- YOU'RE OUT OF THERE.

173
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,122
- WHAT DID
YOU CALL IT AGAIN, BEN?

174
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,958
- [laughing]
WHAT WAS IT CALLED? SAY IT.

175
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,760
- ICE TOWN.

176
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,896
[laughter]

177
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,664
- I WAS JUST A--
I WAS A KID,

178
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:14,067
AND, UM, WHEN YOU--YOU--

179
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,705
YOU END UP GETTING OUT THERE
AND, UH--AND THERE'S A--

180
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,807
- OH, I REALLY WISH YOU GUYS
COULD SEE THIS GUY RIGHT NOW.

181
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,809
HE IS "DRAUNCHED" IS SWEAT.

182
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:24,878
- THERE'S--THERE'S ALSO GONNA BE
PONIES AT THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

183
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,981
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE A CALLER
FROM DOUCHE NATION.

184
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,883
ALL RIGHT, TALK TO ME, CALLER.

185
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,819

186
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:32,786

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,656
- SEEMS LIKE 18
IS PRETTY YOUNG FOR A MAYOR.

188
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,659
WHAT WERE YOU, LIKE, 12?

189
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,761
- THE FUNNY, UM...

190
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:41,962
WHEN...

191
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,732
I GUESS...

192
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,167
THE FORTUNATE, UM...

193
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,803
CAN WE JUST SORT OF--

194
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,839
[video game sound effect]

195
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,907
- GAME OVER, MAN.
GAME OVER.

196
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:57,511
- NICE JOB, MAN.

197
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:59,046
WAS THAT YOUR FIRST TIME
TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE?

198
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,980
'CAUSE IT CAME OFF THAT WAY.

199
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,849
YOU EMBARRASSED ME
IN FRONT OF THE DOUCHE.

200
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,617
- I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS.
I JUST--I HAVEN'T HAD TO DEAL

201
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,918
WITH THAT MAYOR STUFF
FOR 17 YEARS.

202
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,253
I GUESS I'M NOT
TOTALLY OVER IT.

203
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,656
- NO WORRIES. LOOK, IT WAS JUST
A BUMP IN THE ROAD.

204
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:09,857
- OKAY.

205
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,825
- FORTUNATELY, THE LESLIE-MOBILE
IS AN ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLE.

206
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:14,094
SO EVERYTHING INVOLVING BEN
IS FINE.

207
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,763
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO YOU
IN PRIVATE

208
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:19,900
ABOUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT
THAT IS NOT BEN RELATED.

209
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,169
BEN, GOOD JOB.

210
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:25,238
- YOUR BOY'S A NIGHTMARE.
- I KNOW, BUT WE NEED HIM.

211
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,675
IF THEY ASK US ABOUT THE BUDGET,
HE'S OUR NUMBERS GUY.

212
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,909
- WELL, WE SHOULD JUST SLAP

213
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,243
A PAIR OF RAY-BANS
ON A CALCULATOR,

214
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:31,779
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE
WAY MORE CHARMING.

215
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,246
- I'LL DO
THE NEWSPAPER INTERVIEW.

216
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,749
YOU AND BEN DO CHANNEL 4.

217
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,118
PERD HAPLEY IS A BIG SOFTY.
IT'LL BE A PUFF PIECE.

218
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,219
HE CAN DO IT.

219
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,288
- SO HOW ARE YOU
LIKING PAWNEE?

220
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,724
- UM, THERE ARE A LOT OF...
A LOT OF CARS.

221
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,893
I MEAN, NOT TOO MANY...

222
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,728
TRUCKS AND STUFF.

223
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,963
BUT, UH, YEAH.

224
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,899
- COOL.

225
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,134
GOOD TALK, ICE TOWN.
- OKAY.

226
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,107
- WOW. WHO KNEW THAT
WATERCRESS, GARBANZO BEANS,

227
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,875
AND WALNUTS COULD COMPLEMENT
EACH OTHER SO WELL?

228
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,911
- GOOD DRESSING TOO, RIGHT?

229
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,278
FLAXSEED AND AGAVE--

230
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,915
SAME BASIC INGREDIENTS
AS BIRD FEED.

231
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,783
- [sighs]

232
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:13,053
I'M JUST GONNA COME RIGHT OUT
AND SAY IT.

233
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,922
I WANT TO DEFINE
YOUR BAGUA.

234
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,692
- OKAY. WHAT'S THAT?
- IT'S A FENG SHUI TERM.

235
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:22,029
THE ENERGY IN THIS HOUSE
IS A LITTLE STALE,

236
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,765
BUT I THINK
I COULD REDEFINE YOUR FLOW

237
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,267
IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY.

238
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,637
- GREAT.
I'M NOT REALLY ATTACHED

239
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,238
TO THE WAY THIS STUFF
IS ARRANGED

240
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:35,142
OR THE STUFF ITSELF
OR THIS HOUSE EVEN, REALLY.

241
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,610
- GREAT.
LET'S DO IT.

242
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:39,079
- AM I NOT BEING
OBVIOUS ENOUGH?

243
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,948
I FEEL LIKE
I'M BEING OBVIOUS.

244
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,783
- THIS JUST IN.

245
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,085
HARVEST FESTIVAL?
MORE LIKE HARVEST "BESTIVAL."

246
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,987
THE PARKS DEPARTMENT
HAS PLANTED THE SEEDS,

247
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,056
AND NOW THEY'RE
HARVESTING THE REWARDS.

248
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,758
- GREAT, YOU DONE?

249
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,660
- THEY'LL PUT THE "FUN"
IN FUNNEL CAKE.

250
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:53,761
OKAY, NOW I'M DONE.

251
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,729
- TELL ME ABOUT BEN WYATT.
- SURE.

252
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,164
HE WORKS
FOR THE STATE GOVERNMENT,

253
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,232
AND HE'S BEEN COMING TO ADVISE
US ABOUT OUR BUDGET.

254
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,701
- OH, COME ON, LESLIE.

255
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,269
THE DOUCHE BLEW THE STORY
WIDE OPEN.

256
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,404
BEN WYATT BANKRUPTS A TOWN
AND THEN COMES TO PAWNEE

257
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,906
TO TELL US
HOW TO SPEND OUR MONEY?

258
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,307
- THERE'S
NO STORY HERE, SHAUNA.

259
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,242
HE'S JUST
A DEDICATED CIVIL SERVANT

260
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,111
WHO'S DOING WHATEVER HE CAN
TO MAKE SURE

261
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:14,782
THAT THIS IS THE BEST
HARVEST FESTIVAL EVER.

262
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:18,051
AND HE'S EASY ON THE EYES TOO.
[chuckles]

263
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,788
- UM, WHAT EXACTLY IS THE NATURE
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM?

264
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,690
- STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL,
JUST FRIENDS.

265
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:23,924
- SO ARE YOU COLLEAGUES,
OR ARE YOU FRIENDS?

266
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,995
- WE ARE COLLEAGUES
WITH BENEFITS.

267
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:31,098
WE'RE COLLEAGUES
WHO BENEFIT FROM THE FACT

268
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,766
THAT WE'RE ALSO FRIENDS.

269
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,803
I'M SORRY, SHAUNA.
I THINK I NEED TO GO.

270
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,270
BUT, UM, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

271
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,972
AND AS ALWAYS, EVERYTHING
I SAID IS OFF THE RECORD.

272
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,073
OKAY? BYE.

273
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,810
- WHAT'S THE NEXT TASK?

274
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,311
- OH, WE HAVE TO WRITE HER
GRANDMOTHER A THANK-YOU NOTE

275
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,578
FOR A BIRTHDAY CHECK.

276
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,715
IT HAS TO BE REALLY GOOD, TOO,
'CAUSE IT'S FIVE MONTHS LATE.

277
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,316
- NEVER WRITTEN
A THANK-YOU NOTE BEFORE.

278
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,684
THIS WILL BE FUN.

279
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:52,385
WHAT DOES SHE CALL HER?

280
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,454
- GAMMA.
NO, NANNAW.

281
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,356
OR NANNA--
GIZMO.

282
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,225
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

283
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,096
THIS IS FOR YOUR GIZMO.

284
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,733
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

285
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,768
- "DEAR APRIL'S GRANDMOTHER."

286
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,236
I SAID GRANDFATHER.

287
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,805
- OH. OOPS.
OKAY.

288
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,841
- "YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL
AND AMAZING WOMAN--" MAN.

289
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,876
"I HOPE SOMEDAY I CAN BECOME
HALF THE WOMAN YOU ARE."

290
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,010
HE'S A MAN.

291
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,145
"THANK YOU FOR THE $500."

292
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,312
IT WAS $5.

293
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,048
"ENJOY THE MOUSE RAT CD."

294
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:24,017
HE IS DEAF.

295
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:27,755
- OKAY, DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE
THOSE CHANGES, OR IS IT GOOD?

296
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,089
- BEFORE WE DO
THIS NEXT INTERVIEW,

297
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,991
THERE'S A LITTLE SECRET
I WANT TO LET YOU IN ON.

298
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,293
IT'S CALLED
THE HAVERFORD SCHMOOZE.

299
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,862
- I WAS JUST CAUGHT OFF GUARD.
I'M FINE.

300
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,063
- THREE EASY STEPS--

301
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,765
SMILE...

302
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:41,268
FRIENDLY PHYSICAL CONTACT,
AND FLATTERY.

303
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,237
HEY, PERD, IS YOUR DAD ROBOCOP?
'CAUSE YOU'RE ARMS ARE GUNS.

304
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,273
- ROBOCOP DIDN'T HAVE
GUNS FOR ARMS.

305
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,408
- OH, MY GOD. THAT'S SO
NOT THE POINT, YOU NERD.

306
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,878
- I'M JUST SAYING.
WHY ARE WE GOING TO A MALL?

307
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,813
- I'M GETTING YOU A NEW SUIT.

308
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,281
I'VE LET THIS GO ON
LONG ENOUGH.

309
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,449
- I LIKE THIS SUIT.
- YOU SHOULDN'T...

310
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,451
'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE GARBAGE.

311
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,854
- YOUR SUIT LOOKS
MORE LIKE GARBAGE.

312
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,989
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH.

313
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,491
- 'CAUSE BROOKS BROTHERS BOYS
DOESN'T MAKE GARBAGE.

314
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,828
- OKAY, THIS NEXT THING IS
A PHOTOGRAPHY-CLASS ASSIGNMENT.

315
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:08,762
CAN YOU FIGURE THAT OUT?

316
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,799
- "ENCAPSULATE THE SPIRIT
OF MELANCHOLY."

317
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,266
- MELANCHOLY.
- GIVE ME THIS.

318
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,534
EASY.

319
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,536
BOOM--A SAD DESK.

320
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,773
BOOM--SAD WALL.

321
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,275
IT'S ART.
ANYTHING IS ANYTHING.

322
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,877
- OH, RIGHT ON.

323
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,145
UH, I'M GONNA GO DROP THIS OFF
AND PICK UP THE MAIL.

324
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,781
- SAD FLOOR.

325
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:30,283
- IT DOES LOOK SAD...
KIND OF.

326
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:33,821
SORRY FOR STEPPING
ON YOU, FLOOR.

327
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,155
[door opens, closes

328
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,825
- HEY.

329
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,259
YOU GOT ANDY
DOING ALL YOUR WORK FOR YOU?

330
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,962
- YES. BUT HE SAID
HE WANTED TO DO IT.

331
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,797
I'M ONLY DOING IT
BECAUSE I'M GETTING--

332
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:44,898
- YEAH, I DON'T CARE.

333
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,466
I GOT SOMETHING TO ADD
TO YOUR LIST.

334
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,569
YEP.
THERE WE GO.

335
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,271
THAT'S THE STUFF.

336
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,974
- APRIL REALLY DOES THIS
EVERY DAY?

337
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,976
- YES.
WORK THE HEEL.

338
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,310
- ANDY, CAN I BE NEXT?

339
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,279
- YEAH.

340
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:02,515
- I'VE GOT A CORN SO BIG
YOU COULD SLAP BUTTER ON IT.

341
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,285
- WELCOME
TO YA' HEARD WITH PERD.

342
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,820
I'M PERD HAPLEY.

343
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:08,588
THE STORY OF OUR GUESTS TODAY
IS THAT THEY ARE

344
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,590
FROM THE DEPARTMENT
OF PARKS AND RECREATION--

345
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,392
BEN WYATT AND TOM HAVERFORD.

346
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,561
- WHAT UP, PERD?
BIG FAN.

347
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,397
- ME TOO, PERD.
WHAT UP?

348
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,066
- THE THING ABOUT
THIS FIRST QUESTION IS--

349
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,468
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
ABOUT THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

350
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,470
- PERD,
IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING--

351
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:24,637
CARNIVAL RIDES, GAMES.

352
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,208
SWEETUMS IS EVEN BUILDING
A PLUS-SIZED ROLLER COASTER

353
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,577
FOR SOME OF PAWNEE'S OBESE
THRILL SEEKERS.

354
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,112
YOU MUST BE THIS WIDE TO RIDE.

355
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,982
- WOW. THAT'S GONNA BE
A PRETTY BIG ROLLER COASTER.

356
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,950
- YEP.

357
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,451
- HEY, GUYS, HOW'D IT GO?

358
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,453
- WELL, THERE WERE
SOME STICKY MOMENTS.

359
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,622
- LET'S GO
TO THE VIDEOTAPE.

360
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,624
- AH! LOOK...

361
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,459
WHO HASN'T HAD GAY THOUGHTS?

362
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,394
WHO?

363
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,029
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

364
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,363
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE

365
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,531
I MIGHT NEED GLASSES.

366
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,134
IS THERE A BIRD IN HERE?

367
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,603
I SWEAR I KEEP SEEING A BIRD
IN THE STUDIO.

368
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,138
- HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

369
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,606
- HE WAS FINE UNTIL PERD
STARTED ASKING HIM

370
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,208
ABOUT THE BOY-MAYOR STUFF.

371
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,310
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU LOOK PSYCHOTIC.

372
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,612
- I WAS 18
WHEN I WAS ELECTED MAYOR, OKAY?

373
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,981
SO EXCUSE ME FOR THAT.

374
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,117
CINDY ECKERT HAD JUST TURNED ME
DOWN FOR SENIOR PROM.

375
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,952
DO YOU KNOW HOW THAT FEEL--
I SHOULD CALL HER.

376
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,586
I SHOULD. I--
NO, I SHOULDN'T.

377
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,890
AND I'M NOT GOING TO, AND
I'M PROUD OF MYSELF FOR THAT.

378
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:19,626
- AND THEN HE TALKED
ABOUT FEELING UP CINDY ECKERT

379
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,962
FOR THE FIRST TIME
FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.

380
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,630
AND THEN THE SHOW ENDED...

381
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,133
AS DID OUR CAREERS
AND PROBABLY HARVEST FEST.

382
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,901
[camera shutter clicks]

383
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,570
- BOOM--SADNESS.
THAT'S THE ONE.

384
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,976
- NATALIE. HEY.

385
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,210
IT'S ME, ANDY.

386
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:39,312
- YOU'RE
AN HOUR AND HALF LATE.

387
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,380
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

388
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,315
I HAD TO MASSAGE
A TON OF FEET--

389
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,550
SUPER SORRY.

390
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,019
COME ON, GET IN. I-I NEED TO DO
EVERYTHING ON APRIL'S LIST,

391
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,654
OR SHE'S NOT GONNA
GO OUT WITH ME.

392
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,589
- YOU'RE INTO APRIL?

393
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,124
- AH.
COME ON.

394
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,692
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
IN THE CAR.

395
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,327
- HOLD ON.
I'LL GET MY BOOKS.

396
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:55,963
- OKAY.

397
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,231
- OKAY, GREAT.
CALL ME.

398
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,934
THAT SHOULD BE
SOME DAMAGE CONTROL.

399
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,235
I'M HAVING DINNER
WITH PERD HAPLEY.

400
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,436
TOM, WHAT DO WE HAVE?

401
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,372
- I'VE GOTTEN CALLS
FROM A DOZEN BUSINESSES

402
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,706
THINKING ABOUT PULLING
THEIR SPONSORSHIPS.

403
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,375
SWEETUMS MIGHT CANCEL
THE FAT-COASTER.

404
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,442
- OH, MY GOD.

405
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:10,577
OKAY, LOOK, WE NEED TO FOCUS.

406
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,980
WE STILL HAVE
THE PAWNEE TODAY INTERVIEW.

407
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,347
- WELL, IS IT TOO LATE
TO CANCEL?

408
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,384
- YEAH, YEAH,
IT'S TOO LATE TO CANCEL.

409
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,519
JOAN CALLAMEZZO RUNS
THIS TOWN.

410
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,954
BUT, BEN,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

411
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,022
YOU'RE NOT GOING
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA.

412
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,690
- FINE WITH ME.

413
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,692
- ARE YOU TRYING TO LURE
THIS YOUNG LADY INTO YOUR VAN?

414
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,527
- YEAH.

415
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,662
BUT SHE'S BEING
REALLY DIFFICULT ABOUT IT.

416
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,032
UH, AND IT'S ACTUALLY
NOT MY VAN.

417
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,034
UH, I STOLE IT
FROM A FRIEND OF MINE.

418
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,635
I TECHNICALLY
SHOULDN'T BE EVEN DRIVING,

419
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,406
BECAUSE, UH, MY LICENSE
IS CRAZY EXPIRED.

420
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,573
[chuckles]

421
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,075
- THAT'S, UH, DWYER.

422
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,544
D-W-Y-E-R.

423
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:45,678
- OH, DUDE!

424
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,115
COME ON,
I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

425
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:50,683
NATALIE, TELL THIS GUY
YOU KNOW ME.

426
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,520
- [laughs]

427
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,454
- JOAN!

428
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,656
OH, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE JENNIFER ANISTON

429
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,358
FILMING A MOVIE HERE.

430
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,626
[both laugh]

431
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,428
JOAN, LET'S MAKE
A PACT, OKAY?

432
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,031
IF WE'RE BOTH STILL SINGLE
IN AN HOUR, LET'S GET MARRIED.

433
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,765
- TOM, I'M ALREADY MARRIED.

434
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,267
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT, TO SEAL.

435
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,136
OH, I CONFUSED YOU
WITH HEIDI KLUM AGAIN.

436
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,738
- OH!
- SEE YOU LATER, JOAN.

437
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,573
THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE.
[Joan laughing]

438
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,108
- OKAY, FIVE, FOUR...

439
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:18,045
- HELLO, AND WELCOME
TO PAWNEE TODAY.

440
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,679
I'M JOAN CALLAMEZZO.

441
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,714
TODAY'S GUEST IS LESLIE KNOPE,

442
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,217
WHO IS HERE TO TELL US
HOW THIS YEAR'S HARVEST FESTIVAL

443
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,386
IS GOING TO BANKRUPT THE CITY.

444
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,355
- WELL, JOAN, ACTUALLY,
THERE'S A LOT

445
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,357
OF FALSE INFORMATION
FLYING AROUND.

446
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,592
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL IS--
- JUST JUMPING RIGHT IN.

447
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,793
THAT'S RUDE.

448
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,528
- I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW

449
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,397
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY EVENT
THIS IS GOING TO BE.

450
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,632
- BUT AT WHAT COST?

451
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,535
HOW MANY CITIES
DOES BEN WYATT NEED TO DESTROY

452
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,471
BEFORE HE'S PUT BEHIND BARS?

453
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,039
- BEN WYATT
HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG.

454
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:49,576
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO ASK
HIM QUESTIONS,

455
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,643
LET'S GO FOR IT, HUH?

456
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,712
JUST ASK ANY QUESTION
ABOUT HIS PAST OR PRESENT.

457
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,514
JUST GET IT OVER WITH.
BEN, LET'S GET UP HERE.

458
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,416
YEAH, YEAH, COME ON.

459
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,650
WE'LL JUST ASK HIM
A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS,

460
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,752
AND THEN WE'LL GET EVERYTHING
CLEARED AND OUT OF THE WAY.

461
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,054
SOUND GOOD?
YEAH?

462
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,189
- GREAT.
- GOOD.

463
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,790
UH, LET'S TAKE
SOME CALLS, JOAN.

464
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,158
- WHY DON'T YOU?

465
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,626
- OKAY.
UH, CALLER, ARE YOU THERE?

466
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,729
- YEAH, HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY
RAISING TAXES

467
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,332
FOR SOMETHING
THAT WILL HURT THE TOWN?

468
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,568
- I...

469
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,704
FOR...

470
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,773
- UH, JUST TO ADD
TO WHAT BEN'S STAMMERING ABOUT,

471
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,243
UM, WE AREN'T GOING
TO RAISE TAXES,

472
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,678
SO THAT'S THAT.
[chuckles]

473
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,046
NEXT CALLER.

474
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,683
- DO YOU FISH, APRIL?

475
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,652
- NO.
FISH ARE GROSS.

476
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,587
- LET ME GIVE YOU
A PIECE OF FISHING ADVICE.

477
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:35,755
- I SAID I DON'T--

478
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:36,856
- WHEN YOU HAVE A FISH
ON THE LINE,

479
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,425
YOU DON'T JUST DRAG IT
BEHIND THE BOAT.

480
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,561
YOU EITHER REEL IT IN,
OR YOU CUT HIM LOOSE,

481
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,663
ESPECIALLY
IF HE'S A NICE FISH

482
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,432
WITH A BIG,
LOVABLE FISH HEART.

483
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,367
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

484
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,637
- MAYBE NOT.
MAYBE YOU REALLY DO HATE ANDY.

485
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,241
MAYBE MOVING TO INDIANAPOLIS
JUST TO GET REVENGE ON HIM

486
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,576
IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

487
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:59,146
WHAT DO I KNOW?

488
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,782
[cell phone rings, vibrates]

489
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,620
- YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS.

490
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:11,124
VEROSIAN TEA REALLY SUPERCHARGES
THE BACTERIA IN YOUR COLON.

491
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:13,393
PLUS, IT SMELLS INTERESTING.
WAFT IT.

492
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,728
- ARE WE ACTUALLY EVER
GONNA DRINK IT,

493
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,364
OR WE'RE JUST GONNA SNIFF IT?

494
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,399
I LOVE SNIFFING.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

495
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,369
- YOU ARE HILARIOUS.

496
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,437
- SO YOU'RE LEAVING SOON.

497
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:26,806
- UM, BACK
TO INDIANAPOLIS BRIEFLY

498
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,276
AND THEN ON TO A TOWN
CALLED SNERLING, INDIANA,

499
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,443
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.

500
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:31,644
- NEVER HEARD OF IT.

501
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,180
- IT'S QUITE SMALL.

502
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,182
THE COWS OUTNUMBER THE PEOPLE
40 TO 1.

503
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,217
IT SOUNDS AMAZING.

504
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,885
- I LIKE YOU A LOT.

505
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:42,189
I LOVE SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU.

506
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,757
- AND I THOROUGHLY
ENJOY YOU, ANN PERKINS.

507
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,728
- I JUST THINK WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR US.

508
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,430
I DON'T WANT TO BE CLINGY.
I--

509
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,432
- PLEASE, IT IS SOMETHING
THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT,

510
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,534
AND WE SHOULD DO THAT
RIGHT NOW.

511
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:58,705
- I'M SO HAPPY YOU SAID THAT.

512
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,573
WOW, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

513
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,843
- YES, IT'S VERY HARD
TO DRINK.

514
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,680
- YEAH, WHY SHOULD WE TRUST
THIS BEN WYATT GUY?

515
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,716
- BECAUSE I'M TRUSTY.

516
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,718
TRUST ME.
I'M TRUSTWORTHY.

517
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:16,256
AND I AM WORKING
VERY HARD TO...

518
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,559
[sighs] MAKE SURE THAT THIS TOWN
GETS BACK ON ITS FEET.

519
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,960
- THERE WE GO.
OKAY, GREAT.

520
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,295
NEXT CALLER.

521
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,896
- SO I LOOKED YOU UP
ON ALTAVISTA,

522
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,765
AND I FOUND OUT
THAT THE LAST SEVEN TOWNS

523
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,734
YOU'VE GONE TO
ENDED UP BANKRUPT.

524
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,202
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

525
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:32,439
WHY DOES EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN
USE ALTAVISTA?

526
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,541
IS IT 1997?

527
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,776
AND SECOND,
I AM A BUDGET SPECIALIST.

528
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,646
I WENT TO THOSE TOWNS
BECAUSE THEY WERE BANKRUPT,

529
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,581
AND NOW THEY AREN'T.

530
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,616
AND, YEAH, I SCREWED UP
WHEN I WAS 18,

531
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,753
BUT WHO DOESN'T DO DUMB STUFF
WHEN THEY'RE 18?

532
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,721
JOAN?
- I STOLE MY...

533
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:51,991
[clears throat]
GYM TEACHER'S HUSBAND.

535
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,797
- WELL, WHAT ELSE
DO YOU GOT, CALLERS?

536
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,498
GOING ONCE, GOING TWI--

537
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,933
OH, HERE WE GO.
- YEAH, HI.

538
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,769
UM, CAN YOU TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THE CORN MAZE

539
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:03,903
AT THE HARVEST FESTIVAL?

540
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,572
ARE DOGS ALLOWED?

541
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,243
- HELLO.
- HELLO.

542
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:11,744

543
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:12,945

544
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,681
- IT WAS?
- YEAH.

545
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,883
DO YOU HAVE A LIST
FOR TOMORROW?

546
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,585
- [scoffs]

547
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,420
YOU WANT TO DO THIS AGAIN
TOMORROW?

548
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,888
- YES, I DO.
I MEAN, THAT'S THE DEAL, RIGHT?

549
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,456
I GOT TO DO IT
FOR A WHOLE MONTH

550
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,260
AND THEN YOU'RE NOT GONNA MOVE
TO INDIANAPOLIS--

551
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,302
- I BETTER BE THE ONLY PERSON
YOU KISSED TODAY.

552
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,270
- I AM...

553
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:39,339
I'M POSITIVE THAT YOU ARE.

554
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,076
- [chuckles]
IF I THOUGHT YOU WERE SERIOUS,

555
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,978
I'D BE OFFENDED, PERD,
BUT I KNOW THAT WE'RE BUDDIES,

556
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:46,946
AND I KNOW
YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT TO ME.

557
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,317
BUT, NO, THIS IS A BIRTHMARK,
PERD, OKAY?

558
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,285
THIS IS THE LITTLE SCAR I GOT
WHEN I WAS NINE

559
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,955
AND I FELL OFF MY BIKE,
SO, NO, I'M NOT PERFECT!

560
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,325
- I CAN'T LOOK AWAY.
- IT'S A--IT'S AMAZING.

561
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,959
- OKAY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, NO.
HERE'S THE BEST PART.

562
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:03,463
- OKAY, UH, THAT'S ALL THE TIME

563
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,632
I'M PERD HAPLEY,

564
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,368

565
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,836
