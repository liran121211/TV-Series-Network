1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:05,069
Gee whiz.
The Harvest Festival was a real triumph.

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:09,008
<i>We had over eighty thousand</i>
<i>people in attendance,</i>

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,144
<i>which surpassed our</i>
<i>wildest expectations.</i>

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,681
I would like to specifically
single out Leslie Knope.

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,479
I speak for the mayor,
city council, and all of Pawnee

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,450
when I say we
can't wait to see

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,453
what the heck
you're going to do next.

8
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,821
Step on up here, Les.

9
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,551
Thank you.

10
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,361
Paul, are you okay?

11
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,455
Uh...

12
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,766
Oh, my gosh.
Holy!

13
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:40,863
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,998
Call 911!

15
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,977
That was the second
most awkward way

16
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,207
a man has ever
grabbed my breast.

17
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,929
All right, guys.
Everybody, listen up.

18
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,198
Just a few notes about our
camping retreat tomorrow.

19
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,500
We're all gonna meet here
and leave as a group

20
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,666
at 6:45 a.m., promptly.

21
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,000
Why are we doing this?

22
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,168
Harvest Fest is over.

23
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,974
We do not wanna
have a sophomore slump.

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,982
This camping trip is our chance
to think of some really big ideas.

25
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,482
Why don't you just tell us
what our next project is,

26
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,348
and I'll go camping
by myself.

27
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,390
Look, I have ideas, Ron. Okay?
I have, like, 100 new ideas.

28
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,584
But the point is,
the pressure is on.

29
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,623
We only have one chance
to make a second impression.

30
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,061
What portion of this camping
trip will take place outside?

31
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,464
All of it.
Pass.

32
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,364
Can't pass.
It's a mandatory work retreat.

33
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,302
I have a question.
What if we're scaling a cliff

34
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,139
and I start to fall?

35
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,838
Can I grab onto
your boob for support?

36
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,206
No, Tom, don't.
Her boob kills.

37
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,471
My boob
does not kill.

38
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,342
Paul did not die.
He had a heart attack,

39
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,278
which required
an octuple bypass.

40
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,280
Besides, the <i>Pawnee Sun</i> said
that my chest saved his life.

41
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,747
How's the best municipal
department in Pawnee?

42
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:06,849
That's you guys.

43
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,985
Paul is going to be
recuperating for a while.

44
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,224
So, the mayor asked me
to step in as City Manager.

45
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:17,099
And I of course accepted immediately
because Pawnee is literally

46
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,501
the greatest
town in the country.

47
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,898
Of course,
I am gonna miss Indianapolis,

48
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,066
which is the most
wonderful city in America.

49
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,670
I'm so excited to be working
with you all again.

50
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,977
And Leslie, I cannot wait
to hear your new big idea.

51
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,247
I wanna hit the ground running,
and your new mystery project

52
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,715
is going to be
the hydration pack

53
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,151
that gets me to
the finish line.

54
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,480
You're all my
little hydration packs.

55
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,689
I'm sure I am not.

56
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,526
Ron.

57
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,851
Are, too.

58
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,763
Hydration pack!

59
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,534
Hey, you gotta hear this hilarious
story that he's telling me.

60
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,628
Tell her what happened.

61
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:53,694
My identity was stolen.

62
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,502
His identity was stolen.

63
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,310
Tell her about
the accounts.

64
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,934
They were frozen.

65
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:02,603
Frozen.

66
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,671
Bye, Kyle.

67
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,077
Where are you going?
Oh, my God.

68
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,055
How's the coolest chick ever?
Not good.

69
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,283
What do you mean?

70
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,949
Leslie's making us go
on a camping retreat.

71
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,755
That's awesome.
Camping's the best.

72
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,223
Camping sucks.

73
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,894
It's super boring.

74
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:21,430
And you can see the stars,
which I hate. They're creepy.

75
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,525
I love camping.
I bet you I can get you to love it, too.

76
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,159
Why don't I meet you
out there?

77
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,771
If you hate it, we'll leave and
go make out. But if you love it,

78
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,572
we'll stay and make out.
Either way, a ton of making out.

79
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:32,868
You in?

80
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,143
Ann Perkins.
Chris.

81
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,978
Hey. I heard you were back.
Yeah.

82
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,675
I didn't do this
because of you.

83
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,784
Well, it looks great.

84
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,490
Yeah, you look great.
Am I right? It's...

85
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:46,883
So good running into you.

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,087
You know, we should get together soon.
I'd love to catch up.

87
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,163
Me, too.
Catch up and mustard.

88
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,497
Ketchup and mustard.
I just was...

89
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,623
Oh!

90
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,564
So delightful.

91
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,301
I relish your wit.

92
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,709
Well, I salsa your face.

93
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,940
I should hate him.
He broke up with me.

94
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,017
Well, there was an ex that I still
liked after he broke up with me.

95
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:16,119
But it was really hard to stay mad
at him. He was an amazing dentist.

96
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,323
You know, when he saw me,
I swear his face lit up.

97
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,514
Ann.

98
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,390
What do you think "We should
get together soon" means?

99
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,156
No. Do not read into this.

100
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,065
Remember, this is the guy that
was so upbeat and positive,

101
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,896
when he broke up with you,
you didn't even know it happened.

102
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,793
Yeah.

103
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:31,995
Come camping with us.

104
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,466
It'll be really fun. You'll be away
from Chris. You can brainstorm.

105
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,734
I'll give you
first dibs on s'mores.

106
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,145
Okay. That sounds fun.

107
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,309
<i>Here is our</i>
<i>official retreat schedule.</i>

108
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,751
It divides our time evenly
between work and play.

109
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,418
Come on, everybody.
Let's hustle.

110
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,886
Let's get to
the brainstorming!

111
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,325
Great attitude, Ron.

112
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,723
I just wanna get the work
over as soon as possible

113
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,524
so I can do some fishing.

114
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,430
Fishing relaxes me.

115
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,993
It's like yoga,
except I still get to kill something.

116
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:10,175
All right.
I call this wonderful spot.

117
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,105
You didn't bring a tent?

118
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,271
I don't really go
camping ever, Jerry.

119
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,815
So, I'm not going to
spend $150 on a tent.

120
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,280
I'm just gonna
sleep on the floor.

121
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,285
It's called the ground
when it's outside.

122
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,342
Whatever.

123
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,512
Why? Do you guys do
this a lot? Camping?

124
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,653
I've never been before,
but I think I'm gonna love it.

125
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,515
Why am I gonna love it?

126
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,291
SkyMall.

127
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,822
Come check out my tent.
I ordered a bunch of crap off SkyMall.

128
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,566
I got my TV, my Xbox, DVD.

129
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,264
Awesome bed right there.

130
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,001
DJ Roomba's in the mix.

131
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,700
It's like I'm
not even camping.

132
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:42,968
This is actually
a dog couch,

133
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,532
but it's super comfortable.

134
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,073
It's really important to me
that April loves camping.

135
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:54,984
So, I went ahead and set up the
ultimate campsite love nest.

136
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,779
<i>Complete with</i>
<i>beautiful starlight.</i>

137
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,424
<i>We got champagne.</i>
<i>Also, rose petals.</i>

138
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,790
<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>they smell terrific.</i>

139
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,460
We need big ideas, and we need 'em now.
Who wants to go first?

140
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,133
I propose that we take all the money
we made from the Harvest Festival

141
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,333
and return it to the citizens.

142
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,872
So, how much would
that be per person?

143
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,474
About 83 cents.

144
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,705
Per household.

145
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,737
Before postage.

146
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,337
Are we done?

147
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,651
What do Jay-Z, Lil Wayne,
and Drake all have in common?

148
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,414
Oh, I know this one.
They are all rappists.

149
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,384
Oh, my God.
They're rappers, Jerry.

150
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,483
And what they have
in common is none of them

151
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,618
have ever performed
in Pawnee. Why?

152
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,632
Because we don't have
an adequate concert venue.

153
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,366
Until now.

154
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,769
The Pawnee Amphitheater.

155
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,762
How much would that cost?

156
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,664
Not that much.
$200, $300 million.

157
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,436
Right.
Great.

158
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,268
Luxury dog park.

159
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,276
Do you want to
tell us any more?

160
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,080
Poodles only. No pooping.

161
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,149
Hey. Where are you?

162
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,981
I'm here.
Where are you?

163
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,989
We're inside
the main entrance,

164
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,149
near the sign that says
"Pawnee Campground."

165
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,426
I'm in a totally
different place.

166
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,059
That's why we
can't see each other.

167
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,460
<i>My God, Andy,</i>

168
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,965
I don't even wanna be here.

169
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,302
The air is too fresh.
It's disgusting. I can't breathe.

170
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,371
There's a brook somewhere that
won't stop babbling. Shut up!

171
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,933
Sweetheart. Just hold tight
and I'll be there.

172
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,069
Well, April is right here.

173
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,377
And I am down here somewhere.

174
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,809
How about we just
invest the money?

175
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,544
Make 4% a year.

176
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,611
You know, set up a nice
little nest egg for the city.

177
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:37,950
What do you think?

178
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,318
Great idea.
Thanks, white Urkel.

179
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,419
All right. Maybe it's not the
sexiest idea, Tom, but it's smart.

180
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,627
What are you even still doing here?
Harvest Festival is over.

181
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,364
Shouldn't you be
back in Indianapolis?

182
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,966
Hey. Ben helped us launch
the Harvest Festival,

183
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,595
and he knows how
Chris's mind works.

184
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,262
And he's a valuable
asset to the team.

185
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,432
Thank you.

186
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,237
April has not presented her idea.
April?

187
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,272
I didn't come up with anything.
Why?

188
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,172
Because I know that
whatever we come up with

189
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,441
isn't gonna be
good enough anyway,

190
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,776
and we're just
gonna go with your idea.

191
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,139
She's got a point.

192
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,715
Leslie, just tell
us what your idea is

193
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,184
so I can go back
to the Thunderdome.

194
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,083
That's what I'm
calling my tent.

195
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,850
I am really
disappointed in all of you.

196
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,955
You know, the whole town
is looking at us right now.

197
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,852
And you're letting 'em down.

198
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,424
Take an hour.
Go clear your heads

199
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,089
and see if you can come up with
a real idea that we can use.

200
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,629
And also,
see if you're interested

201
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,030
in contributing
to this department.

202
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,705
Then, after that,
I will tell you my idea.

203
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,036
Wow. You really
let 'em have it.

204
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,511
Well, I had no choice.
I didn't wanna tell them my idea.

205
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,815
Why not?
Because I don't have one.

206
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,282
I don't have
an idea, Ann.

207
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,622
I'm so screwed, Ann.

208
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,715
The meeting is tomorrow,
and I don't have anything.

209
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,156
Why not just build the park
on the lot behind my house?

210
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,656
Chris wants the new project
to generate revenue.

211
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,229
What about those
binders in your office?

212
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,731
They're filled
with small ideas.

213
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,461
We need a big,
juicy idea.

214
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,335
I'm so desperate,
I even brought in my dream journal,

215
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,463
hoping it would inspire me.

216
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,802
"I married ALF and
we're pretty happy."

217
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,067
That sounds nice.
It was.

218
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:10,839
Okay, listen to me.
You are smart and creative and talented,

219
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,851
and you're gonna be fine.
You're probably right.

220
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,615
I just need an hour
and it'll come to me.

221
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,283
Hello?

222
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,861
Andy, you have to save me.

223
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,363
I'm camping with
people I work with.

224
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,620
Hello. April.

225
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:27,688
Hello?

226
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,031
Walk around in circles
like I am.

227
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,497
Help triangulate
the phone call.

228
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,066
Hello?

229
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,237
Hang on.
I'm gonna try to get to higher ground.

230
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,708
I found some thorns.

231
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,708
I mean, yes, my daughter
might think she is old enough

232
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,412
to be sexually
active with her boyfriend.

233
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,545
But I'm sorry, 16,

234
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,214
that just seems too young
to be on birth control.

235
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,654
You know,
I was 24 when Gayle took my virginity.

236
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,594
What say we just
stand here in silence

237
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,231
and think of
ideas for projects?

238
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,399
You know what I should do? I should
lead a teen abstinence workshop.

239
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,469
That might be
incredibly effective.

240
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,511
Hey, Tom.

241
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,524
One second. I'm just in the
middle of a head massage.

242
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,395
Well, that's a good stopping point.
What's up?

243
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,785
Uh...

244
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,631
You wanna bounce
some ideas off each other?

245
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,424
Here's a better idea. How about I
bounce my way over to my dog couch

246
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,127
and watch a little
Season Six of <i>Top Chef?</i>

247
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,361
All right.

248
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,496
I know Leslie seems upset.

249
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,097
But the truth is,
she's better than us

250
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,799
at this stuff by
a thousand miles.

251
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,373
So, there's really no point.
Care for some fondue?

252
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,503
Yeah.

253
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,975
Hey. How do you
afford all this stuff?

254
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,581
I just return it the next day
and claim it was defective.

255
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,181
The key is crying a lot.

256
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,618
No one likes to
hear a grown man cry.

257
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,689
"And then, my hand accidentally
went in the panini press!"

258
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,560
Hey. You wanna go
for a walk?

259
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,852
Yeah.

260
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,031
Wow. The sky
is really beautiful.

261
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,295
It's pollution from the
Sweetums factory. It's gorgeous,

262
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,337
but is it worth
the asthma?

263
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,265
No.

264
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,865
Ben, this new project idea,

265
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,002
it's not really a big deal.
I'm probably making too much out of it.

266
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,769
Oh, no, no.
It's really big.

267
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,575
I mean, you got everyone's
attention with the Harvest Festival.

268
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,912
Now, you're gonna
seal the deal.

269
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,349
It's the chance
you've been waiting for.

270
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,020
What if the festival was, like,
a high point for me,

271
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,317
and I never do
anything better than that?

272
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,250
Then you wouldn't
be Leslie Knope.

273
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,758
So, I have to keep thinking
about good ideas all the time,

274
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:39,920
or I'm no longer myself?

275
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,055
No, no, no.
No, no. Not at all.

276
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,559
I've just honestly never met
someone who works as hard as you do.

277
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,399
I mean, you're like the Energizer
Bunny of city government.

278
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,511
And when she looked
in the back of her car,

279
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,505
she saw that even though it
was her own private property,

280
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,878
she would be
forced to take it in

281
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,148
for a state inspection!

282
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,721
Okay, guys. Listen up.

283
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,586
What was that?
That was me talking.

284
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,629
No, I heard it, too.
Andy?

285
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,395
If that's a coyote,
someone needs

286
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,930
to pick me up
off the ground now.

287
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,862
Oh, my God!

288
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:16,959
Hey, guys.

289
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,094
What are you doing here?

290
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,329
I was just out for
my nighttime run,

291
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,600
and I thought,
"Why not go visit the Parks Department?"

292
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,766
How's everything going here?

293
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,867
Super great. Really well.

294
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,868
We have a great idea.

295
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,381
Tell me now while I
sit on this boulder.

296
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,876
I'm much more
receptive to new ideas

297
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,210
when my heart rate
is still elevated.

298
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,918
Chris, do you wanna maybe
just talk for a minute?

299
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,211
Let them work?

300
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,515
Oh! Sure.

301
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,393
What was that? What was that?

302
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,901
Leslie,
just tell us your idea.

303
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,672
<i>Los Angeles,</i> Season One
isn't gonna watch itself.

304
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,466
Here it is.

305
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,339
What do you think?

306
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,484
I don't have an idea.
I'm sorry.

307
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,847
I thought if we all
worked really hard,

308
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,151
I could come up
with something.

309
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,351
But I don't have anything,
and we're totally screwed.

310
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:19,621
And what we need to do is just keep
working and just work again more

311
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,690
and just do it and get it.
And then we got it and we're good.

312
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,024
Go with that.

313
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,327
I think
I'm gonna turn in.

314
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,464
You're not
going anywhere.

315
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,270
No one's going anywhere.
No one's sleeping

316
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,707
because this is an all-nighter.
And that'll be fun.

317
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,679
We'll all stay up and then,
I'll be like, "Hey! No one sleep!"

318
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,274
Do you hear
how loud that is?

319
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,111
You're not
sleeping through that.

320
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,446
Is there anything else
to eat?

321
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,216
The marshmallows
are all gone.

322
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,617
We have nothing to eat.

323
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:49,254
Jerry scared all the fish away
with his loud personal stories.

324
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,293
I wanna go home.
I miss my canopy bed.

325
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,395
Yeah. I'm fine
with not camping.

326
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,930
Especially since my stupid
boyfriend abandoned me!

327
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,366
I'll fire up the van.

328
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,071
You know,
I've never moved this slowly before.

329
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,735
It's almost like
being in quicksand.

330
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,536
Hey, um, listen.

331
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,846
When you dumped me,
it was really embarrassing.

332
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,452
You just kind of took off.

333
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,515
Oh, I'm so sorry. I mean,
I never meant to hurt you.

334
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,159
And well, I'm back now.

335
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:22,955
Hey, I have a great idea.

336
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,119
Why don't we go to this
rustic diner that I know?

337
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,462
We can have egg white omelets and
we can continue to talk about us.

338
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:29,957
Sounds good.

339
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,165
No, no.

340
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,539
Chocolate
or butterscotch?

341
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:43,074
Swirl me. Dude, camping is awesome.
I love it.

342
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,773
Excuse me, gentlemen.

343
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,247
How long have you been
running power to this tent?

344
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,147
I don't know.
How long have we been here?

345
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,448
Ten hours.

346
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,087
No! I was TiVoing
<i>Cupcake Wars.</i>

347
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,658
This is ridiculous!

348
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,159
Look, I am used
to a certain level

349
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,697
of comfort in my life,
and I didn't want to sacrifice that.

350
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:00,992
Okay, well,
I packed everything up.

351
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,795
So, now, you're telling me
I have to go unpack it?

352
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,592
Guys, this is a sign.

353
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,331
You wanted to leave,
and now you're stuck here with me.

354
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,169
So, we can work all night.

355
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,308
This is gonna be so much fun!
All-night work!

356
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,941
All-night work!
All-night work!

357
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,315
You know what? There's a bed
and breakfast right up the road.

358
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,475
I'm gonna head there.

359
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,711
Yes. Let's keep brainstorming.

360
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,515
I have a good
feeling about this B&B.

361
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,789
One day, there's gonna be
a plaque there that reads,

362
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,985
"This is where Leslie Knope came
up with the amazing idea for..."

363
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,326
Damn,
I thought that would work.

364
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:38,033
Welcome to
"The Quiet Corn".

365
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:39,985
I'm Elsa Clack.

366
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,887
Breakfast is served
between 5:30

367
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:44,555
and 6:15 A.M.

368
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:46,824
What if we sleep
to a normal hour?

369
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:49,143
Well, that would be
very rude of you.

370
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,779
May I take
your breakfast order?

371
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:53,448
We have hardboiled eggs,

372
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:59,237
homemade tomato slices
with dry seed and leek jam,

373
00:15:59,304 --> 00:16:01,956
and your choice
of german muffin.

374
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:05,910
What the
Is a german muffin?

375
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:10,615
Oh, good lord.

376
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:12,216
I call the bed!

377
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:14,285
Ah.

378
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:15,386
Awesome.

379
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:16,754
I hate this place.

380
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:18,589
This place is the exact opposite
of <i>Skymall.</i>

381
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,590
Oh, listen to this.

382
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,292
"Dear Quiet Corn,

383
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:23,494
"thank you for
your beautiful Inn.

384
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:25,796
"My wife and I spent
three nights of ecstasy

385
00:16:25,848 --> 00:16:27,398
in this room."

386
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:28,466
Ugh!

387
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:29,517
Gyash!

388
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:33,237
There are no TVs anywhere.

389
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:35,656
This place is lamer
than outside.

390
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:37,275
I'm chillin'.

391
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:38,576
What is that?

392
00:16:38,643 --> 00:16:39,811
Jim.

393
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:43,114
? Tou come sleepin'
in the tent?

394
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:44,148
Oh, my God.

395
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,350
? sleepin' in the tent?

396
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:48,669
I found you!

397
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:53,624
? I found you?

398
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:55,760
? and I had to fight
a squirrel?

399
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:57,495
where have you been?

400
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:59,130
I told you I was gonna
take you campin', didn't I?

401
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:00,431
Yeah.

402
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:01,933
Well, I'm taking you campin'.
Look at this.

403
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,501
This is what I had set up
at the other campsite.

404
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:05,686
Except for it
was way nicer there.

405
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:08,506
But this'll do.
I've got some champagne.

406
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:11,843
And I had to drink
most of it to survive.

407
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,645
So I'm kind of buzzed
right now.

408
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:16,681
I'm just glad you're here.

409
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:17,782
Can we make out now?

410
00:17:20,035 --> 00:17:22,120
No, you have to understand

411
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:24,188
that at the time,
I genuinely thought

412
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,357
that you and I would never
see each other again.

413
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:28,242
I completely understand.

414
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:29,794
Well, that's what
makes you so amazing.

415
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:32,029
- No.
- Ann Perkins...

416
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:33,081
Amazing.

417
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:37,769
Oh, no.

418
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:40,054
Oh, no?

419
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,305
Oh, no.

420
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:43,558
No, no, no.
I wasn't saying that...

421
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:46,177
I thought we should
get back together again.

422
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:47,712
But you said that...

423
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,480
You indicated...

424
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:52,066
Oh, my God,
this is happening again.

425
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:54,152
I have to move, right?

426
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:56,053
Yeah.

427
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,321
I'm gonna leave the country.

428
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:59,890
Bye, everybody.
Bye.

429
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:05,229
Hey.

430
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:06,564
Hey. Couldn't sleep?

431
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:10,568
No. My room is filled
with cat hair and cat smell.

432
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:13,337
And actual cats,
roughly 12 cats.

433
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:14,572
Hmm, sounds delightful.

434
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:16,073
Leslie, what are you doing?

435
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:19,577
I am listening to
<i>Steal my Sunshine</i> by Len.

436
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:22,213
A one-hit wonder, like me.

437
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:23,414
You're not
a one-hit wonder.

438
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:24,582
Well, I will be.

439
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,284
I peaked at
the Harvest Festival, Ron.

440
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:27,618
Years from now,
people are gonna say,

441
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:28,886
"Remember that woman
who came up with

442
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:30,354
"the Harvest Festival idea
and never came up

443
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,556
"with another idea again?

444
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:32,523
"What happened to her?
What was her name?

445
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:33,724
"Kim? Anyway, who cares?

446
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:35,359
"She's stupid,
and she's dead now."

447
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:36,527
For the first time ever,

448
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:37,962
the Parks Department
has real momentum,

449
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,430
and I'm gonna ruin it
for everybody.

450
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:41,532
You've done more
for this group of people

451
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,100
than anyone else.

452
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:45,736
You're the only reason we all
still have jobs.

453
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:47,288
I think we'll be okay.

454
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:48,939
Yeah, okay, well, I would
love to chit-chat about this,

455
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:50,274
but I need
to keep working, okay?

456
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:52,543
And keep pushing so that
my breakthrough will happen,

457
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:55,046
and I will be ready for it.

458
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,280
You know what?

459
00:18:56,331 --> 00:18:59,083
I just had an idea
for a new project.

460
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:00,918
- Really?
- Yes.

461
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:03,454
Yes, I think... I think
this could be really good.

462
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:04,722
What is it?

463
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,723
Come with me.

464
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,391
Right through here.

465
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:08,426
Wait, what's happening?

466
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:10,394
Aah! Ron!

467
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:12,163
Ron, what are you doing?

468
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:13,514
This is my idea.

469
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,933
You're gonna shut your brain
down and go to sleep,

470
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:17,435
and I'm gonna stay out here
and guard the door

471
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:19,503
- so you can't leave.
- No! Ron!

472
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:20,805
You've been
thinking about work

473
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:22,440
non-stop for years!

474
00:19:22,507 --> 00:19:23,641
It's time to rest!

475
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,326
All my binders
are downstairs!

476
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,477
Shh!

477
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:27,879
All due respect,
Ms. Clack,

478
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:29,313
stick a german muffin in it.

479
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:31,415
Fair enough.
I'm just gonna go to bed.

480
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:33,517
Just call it a night.

481
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:34,986
I already checked, Leslie.

482
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:36,587
The transom is painted shut.

483
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:39,123
Damn it!

484
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:41,826
Oh, my God, there's, like,
50 cats in here.

485
00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:48,299
Where's Leslie?

486
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,967
Not 100% sure.

487
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:51,519
Should we reschedule or...

488
00:19:51,603 --> 00:19:53,104
nope, she'll be here.

489
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:54,105
Good morning!

490
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:55,940
So I just slept seven hours,

491
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:57,808
which is twice as long
as I usually sleep,

492
00:19:57,876 --> 00:19:59,277
so I'm a little disoriented.

493
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:01,379
But I did wake up
with a million ideas,

494
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:03,030
and Ron would not
let me have any paper,

495
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:05,349
so I had to write them down
on this doily.

496
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,785
We should buy a telescope
and make the old ranger station

497
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:09,553
in Ramsett Park
an Observatory.

498
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:10,655
That way,
we could sell tickets

499
00:20:10,722 --> 00:20:11,722
and have class trips.

500
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,957
- I like it! We'll...
- Good!

501
00:20:13,024 --> 00:20:14,041
Then have theme night
at the Park.

502
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:16,193
We could have singles,
um, date night,

503
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:19,297
uh, seniors, and we could
have a citywide yard sale,

504
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:21,632
which would be part auction,
part <i>Antiques Road Show.</i>

505
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,867
And then we could have

506
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:24,302
the professors from
the Community College

507
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:25,703
come in and assign value
to the objects.

508
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,338
And then we could split
the profits for the school.

509
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:28,339
It'd be a lot of fun.

510
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,340
I'll see you boys later.

511
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:30,708
Bye, Ron!

512
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:32,510
They say you're only as good
as your last idea.

513
00:20:32,577 --> 00:20:35,246
I say you're only as good
as the people you work with.

514
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:37,181
Leslie Knope is back.

515
00:20:37,232 --> 00:20:38,349
Ha ha!

516
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,651
Oh, my God,
my breath is so bad.

517
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:13,334
Yeah, she died, like,
20 minutes after that.
