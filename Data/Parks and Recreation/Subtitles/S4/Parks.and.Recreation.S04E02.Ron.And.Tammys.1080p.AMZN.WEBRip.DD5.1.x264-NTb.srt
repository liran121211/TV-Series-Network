1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,071
- OKAY, GUYS.
THE BATTLE ROYALE IS COMING UP.

2
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:06,274
EVERY DEPARTMENT IN ONE ROOM,
ARGUING FOR MORE MONEY.

3
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:08,576
BUDGETARY THUNDERDOME!

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,645
SO, UH, MAKE LISTS OF WHY
OTHER DEPARTMENTS SUCK,

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,814
AND I'M GONNA GO
GET THE SECRET WEAPON.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,484
OUR SECRET WEAPON IN THIS
BUDGETARY BATTLE?

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:17,585
RON.

8
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:20,288
EVERY TIME ANOTHER DEPARTMENT
ASKS FOR MORE MONEY,

9
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,556
HE JUST STARES THEM DOWN
UNTIL THEY BACK OFF

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,793
AND/OR WET THEMSELVES.

11
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:29,297
HEY, WHO'S READY TO GET--

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,298
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,533
- TAMMY ONE SHOWED UP.

14
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:35,169
I'M BEING AUDITED BY THE IRS.

15
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,537
- NO!

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,705
YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE.

17
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,407
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW THIS.

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,443
FIRST OF ALL,
INCOME TAX IS ILLEGAL.

19
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,379
SECOND, TAMMY IS
A PSYCHOLOGICAL MASTERMIND.

20
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,081
THIS IS JUST ANOTHER WAY FOR HER

21
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:49,517
TO PUT HER HAND UP MY KEISTER

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,852
AND CONTROL ME LIKE A PUPPET.

23
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,321
I'D RATHER BE LOCKED UP.

24
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,589
- RON, THIS IS
A FEDERAL TAX AUDIT.

25
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,358
YOU COULD GO TO JAIL.

26
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,359
JAIL, RON.

27
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,593
RON, JAIL.

28
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:00,794
JAIL, RON, JAIL.

29
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,196
YOU COULD GO TO JAIL.

30
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,331
JAIL, JAIL, JAIL.

31
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:04,332
- ARE YOU BROKEN?

32
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:05,599
- ANDY, APRIL!

33
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:06,667
- WHAT'S UP, BOSS?

34
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,501
- STOP YELLING
AND BEING ANNOYING.

35
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,471
- GRAB YOUR CALCULATORS.
SETTLE IN.

36
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,141
OPERATION RESCUE RON
IS STARTING.

37
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:14,242
DON'T WORRY.

38
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,376
I WILL THINK OF A BETTER NAME
FOR IT BY TOMORROW.

39
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,377
- HERE YOU GO.

40
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,445
- CALCULATOR.

41
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:20,448
[triumphant music]

42
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:26,487
*

43
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:39,900
- HEY...
- HEY, MAN.

44
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,868
- BEN.

45
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,171
- HEY, THANKS
FOR TEXTING ME TO HANG OUT.

46
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:44,372
I'VE REALLY FELT
LIKE WE'VE DEVELOPED

47
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:45,406
A COOL FRIENDSHIP, AND--

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,308
ANYWAY, IT WAS JUST NICE
TO HAVE THAT VALIDATED.

49
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,442
- YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

50
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:51,545
LOOK, WE GOT SOME DOCUMENTS
OVER AT ENTERTAINMENT720

51
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,147
THAT SEEM REALLY COMPLICATED.

52
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:54,615
AND I THOUGHT, MAYBE YOU COULD
TAKE A LOOK AT THEM

53
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:58,819
BECAUSE NERD STUFF PROBABLY
REALLY EXCITES YOU,

54
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,154
BECAUSE YOU'RE A NERD.

55
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:01,555
- NO, OF COURSE.
YEAH, NO, I JUST--

56
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,157
PUT ON MY STAR WARS PAJAMAS

57
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:04,558
AND SIT IN MY MOM'S BASEMENT

58
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:05,693
AND PORE OVER SOME SPREADSHEETS.

59
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:06,694
SOUNDS GREAT.

60
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:07,761
YEAH.
W-W-WHAT'D YOU GOT?

61
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,598
- SOMETHING CALLED
"BREAK EVEN ANALYSIS TABLES."

62
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,599
- OH, BREAK EVENS?

63
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,600
THOSE ARE REALLY FUN.

64
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,601
YEAH, SURE.
I'LL TAKE A LOOK.

65
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,602
- LET'S HIT IT.

66
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,603
- WHAT YOU--
RIGHT NOW?

67
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,371
UH--I HAVE WORK.

68
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:20,641
- AND I THOUGHT I HAD A FRIEND.

69
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:21,609
- ALL RIGHT.

70
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,511
- IT'S ALMOST TOO EASY.

71
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:24,512
- I CAN HEAR YOU.

72
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,679
- [laughs]

73
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:26,947
I KNOW YOU CAN,
BEN.

74
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,949
THAT'S HOW EASY IT IS.

75
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,719
- SO WE NEED TO FIND PROOF
OF EVERY TAX DEDUCTION

76
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,754
I'VE TAKEN
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

77
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,689
- RON, MOST OF THESE
AREN'T EVEN RECEIPTS.

78
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:39,193
THIS ONE SAYS,
"I BOUGHT SUPPLIES. 2007".

79
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:41,662
- YOU WON'T FIND ANY
BANK STATEMENTS EITHER.

80
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,264
I'VE HEAVILY INVESTED IN GOLD

81
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,399
WHICH I'VE BURIED
IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT LOCATIONS

82
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:47,635
AROUND PAWNEE.

83
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,902
OR HAVE I?

84
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:49,903
- WHAT'S THIS?

85
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,539
SOME KIND OF LAME DRUG DEAL?

86
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,307
- THAT IS
A GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT.

87
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,209
I MADE THAT MAN
A DINING ROOM TABLE

88
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:57,478
IN EXCHANGE FOR 60 FEET
OF COPPER PIPE

89
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,912
AND A HALF PIG.

90
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,382
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE SOME
ACTUAL RECEIPTS HERE.

91
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,252
SAME AMOUNT, EVERY MONTH.
140 BUCKS.

92
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,253
WHAT'S THIS?

93
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,287
- EVERY 30 DAYS,

94
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,756
I BUY SHOTGUN SHELLS
AND CIGARETTES

95
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,358
AND SEND THEM HOME TO MY MOM.

96
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,659
- [laughs]

97
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,626
- THAT'S SO SWEET.

98
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,328
YOUR MOM SOUNDS KICKASS.

99
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,497
- MY FIRST EX-WIFE'S NAME
IS TAMMY.

100
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,900
MY SECOND EX-WIFE'S NAME
IS TAMMY.

101
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:24,905
MY MOM'S NAME IS TAMARA.

102
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,607
SHE GOES BY TAMMY.

103
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,478
- YOU CAN PREVENT
ADULT-ONSET DIABETES

104
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:33,247
BY GETTING AN ANNUAL CHECK-UP,

105
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,915
EXERCISING,

106
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:35,916
PRAYING...

107
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:36,917
- OKAY.
[clears throat]

108
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,918
- WHO IS THAT GUY?

109
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:38,819
- THAT IS WALT MORPHLING.

110
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,621
HE WAS THE DIRECTOR
OF PUBLIC HEALTH,

111
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,323
BUT HE HAD TO RETIRE AT 46

112
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:43,491
BECAUSE HE HAD DIABETES.

113
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:44,725
- THAT IS SAD, BUT ALSO,

114
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,794
IN THIS TOWN,
UNDERSTANDABLE.

115
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:47,895
- I WOULD LIKE
TO SHOOT A NEW PSA

116
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,330
AND I THINK IT'D BE GOOD
TO GET SOMEONE

117
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,931
WHO'S HEALTHY AND TELEGENIC,

118
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:55,336
AND I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WOULD BE PERFECT.

119
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,437
- ANN PERKINS.

120
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,438
I AM FLATTERED.

121
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,439
AND I WILL DO IT.

122
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,540
IS THERE A SCRIPT YET?

123
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,975
- UH, NO, BECAUSE YOU JUST
APPROVED THE IDEA, LIKE,

124
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,344
THREE SECONDS AGO.

125
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,345
- I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO WRITE ME A SCRIPT

126
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,313
AND GET IT TO ME IN AN HOUR.

127
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,381
AND WE SHOULD START THINKING
ABOUT WARDROBE.

128
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:08,516
CASUAL?

129
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:09,917
FORMAL? SEMI-FORMAL?

130
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,918
SPORTY?

131
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:11,919
SCARY?

132
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:12,920
POSH? BABY?

133
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:13,854
THOSE ARE THE SPICE GIRLS.

134
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,022
I JUST GOT CAUGHT UP
IN MY OWN THOUGHTS.

135
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:15,989
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

136
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:17,791
- IN TERMS OF SHIRTS,
I CAN WEAR WHITE...

137
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,727
- WELCOME TO PARADISE,
MY MAN.

138
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,995
YOU CAN CHILL
OVER THERE BY THE BAR.

139
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,964
WE ALSO GOT BASKETBALL
AT ANY TIME YOU WANT.

140
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,400
THERE'S ROY HIBBERT
AND DETLEF SCHREMPF.

141
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,636
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S AN ACTUAL NBA PLAYER.

142
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:29,803
HE PLAYS FOR THE PACERS.

143
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:30,804
- NBA'S ON STRIKE,

144
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:31,839
SO WE GOT HIM FOR ONLY, LIKE,

145
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,642
75% OF HIS ORIGINAL NBA SALARY.

146
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:35,943
WHAT UP, ROY?

147
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,044
- IS THIS ALL YOU WANT ME TO DO?

148
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,512
PLAY ONE ON ONE WITH DETLEF?

149
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:39,513
- YES.

150
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,482
AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

151
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,483
JEAN-RALPHIO!

152
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,984
- TAKE ME THERE.

153
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,620
[shouting]

154
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,889
- BUMP!
[laughs]

155
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:49,890
- WHO ARE YOU?

156
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,091
- UH--
- THIS IS BEN.

157
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,092
HE'S HERE TO HELP US
WITH THE PAPERWORK.

158
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,093
- BEN?
IS THAT YOUR REAL NAME?

159
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,395
- YES.

160
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,363
- OH, YOU COULD DO BETTER
THAN THAT.

161
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:56,364
I'MA HELP YOU OUT RIGHT NOW.

162
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,297
YOUR NAME IS ANGELO.

163
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,198
ANGELO, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING OUT.

164
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:58,999
GET A THICKER TIE.
IT LOOKS WEIRD ON YOU.

165
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,402
MAKES YOUR HEAD
LOOK LIKE A FISH.

166
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,503
SECONDLY,

167
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:03,704
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE PAPERWORK IS,

168
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:04,705
BUT WHEN YOU FIND IT,

169
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:05,773
CAN YOU TAKE CARE OF IT FOR US?

170
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,441
WE DON'T HAVE ANY PENS

171
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:08,442
'CAUSE WE'RE AFRAID
IT'S GONNA LEAK IN OUR SHIRTS.

172
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,577
LASTLY, I HATE THE NAME,
ANGELO.

173
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,911
I'MA SWITCH IT UP FOR YOU,
RIGHT NOW.

174
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,981
YOUR NEW NICKNAME IS...

175
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,516
JELL-O SHOT.

176
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,050
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT,
J-SHOT?

177
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:18,051
DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS?

178
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,053
- YEAH. WHERE ARE WE?

179
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,021

00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,134

188
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,135
- I GUESS.

189
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,370
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

190
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:37,371
- IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING,

191
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:39,507
HOW MUCH ARE THEY PAYING YOU?

192
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,475
- $100,000 A YEAR.

193
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,011
WITH FULL MEDICAL.

194
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,579
- I MEAN, I WOULD GUESS
THEY'LL BE BANKRUPT

195
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:47,014
BY THE END OF...

196
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:51,452
THIS SENTENCE.

197
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,621
NO, THANK YOU.

198
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:54,722
- IS THIS TRUE?

199
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,658
YOU ONLY SPENT $40 ON CLOTHES
IN THE PAST 5 YEARS?

200
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,959
- IT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

201
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,128
- HOW DID YOU MEET TAMMY ONE?

202
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,030
- TECHNICALLY, I'VE KNOWN HER
SINCE I WAS BORN.

203
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,399
SHE WAS A CANDY STRIPER
AT THE HOSPITAL.

204
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:06,400
SHE HELPED DELIVER ME.

205
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:08,402
all: OH, MY GOD.

206
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,070
- I GREW UP
IN A VERY SMALL TOWN.

207
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,605
600 PEOPLE.

208
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,774
EVERYBODY KNEW EVERYBODY ELSE.

209
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,876
WE FIRST TOOK UP TOGETHER
WHEN I WAS 15.

210
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,411
- AWESOME.
- OH, MY GOD.

211
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:18,579
- IT WAS A LITTLE SCANDALOUS,

212
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,915
BUT EVERYONE FEARED HER,
SO THEY KEPT THEIR MOUTHS SHUT.

213
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,151
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER,
BUT SHE'S MY HERO.

214
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,454
- NO, SHE'S NO HERO, APRIL.

215
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,489
SHE'S A HELLACIOUS NIGHTMARE.

216
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,525
SHE DID, HOWEVER,
TEACH ME EVERYTHING I KNOW.

217
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,627
SUNDAY SCHOOL, SEX.

218
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,195
SHE WAS MY MATH TEACHER
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL

219
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,998
AND MY BABYSITTER,
AND SHE TAUGHT DRIVER'S ED.

220
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,032
I--

221
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:42,770
- HELLO.

222
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:43,771
I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET.

223
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,906
I AM LESLIE KNOPE, DEPUTY--

224
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,207
- I DON'T THINK
IT WILL BE NECESSARY

225
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,612
FOR YOU TO SPEAK AGAIN
WHILE I'M HERE.

226
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,815
- WHY DO I ONLY DATE BRUNETTES?

227
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,017
YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES YOU EAT CHICKEN

228
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,118
AND YOU GET FOOD POISONING

229
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,955
AND THEN, EVEN THE SIGHT
OF CHICKEN MAKES YOU SICK?

230
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,725
TAMMY ONE IS MY BLONDE CHICKEN.

231
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,194
- GOOD GOD, RONALD.

232
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,930
THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER MESS
THAN I IMAGINED.

233
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,231
YOU'LL TAKE A WEEK OFF
FROM WORK.

234
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,200
WE'LL DO A COMPLETE OVERHAUL
OF YOUR FINANCES.

235
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,068
I'LL NEED ACCESS
TO ALL YOUR ACCOUNTS,

236
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,005
AND YOUR HOME.

237
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,673
- IS THAT NECESSARY?

238
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:20,874
- OH, OH.

239
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,910
WE'RE PLAYING A GAME WHERE
EVERYONE SAYS SOMETHING STUPID?

240
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,878
- [laughs]

241
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,715
- YOU.
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

242
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,049
- TIM.

243
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,050
TIM BUCKENOWSKI.

244
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,752
- REALLY?

245
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,753
- NO.

246
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,954
ANDY DWYER.

247
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,255
- ANDY...

248
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,657
YOU'RE GOING TO COLLECT
ALL OF THIS,

249
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,792
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO PUT IT IN MY CAR.

250
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:39,927
- WHAT--
- MS. KNOPE.

251
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,928
- YES?

252
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,496
- YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO PAYROLL

253
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,566
AND GET COPIES OF RONALD'S
WORKPLACE EXPENSE REPORTS.

254
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,902
- OH, I--I'M JUST WONDERING
HOW LONG THAT'S GOING TO TAKE,

255
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,505
BECAUSE RON AND I HAVE A VERY
IMPORTANT MEETING TOGETHER.

256
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,740
IT'S CALLED THE BATTLE ROYALE.

257
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:53,707
IT'S SUPER FUN.

258
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:54,608
WELL...

259
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:57,645
- YOU AND RON
HAVE A BIG MEETING, HUH?

260
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,947
- I'M SURE RON WILL REMEMBER
THE MEETING FONDLY

261
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,583
WHILE HE MAKES TOILET WINE
IN A FEDERAL PRISON

262
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:06,119
IN TERRE HAUTE.

263
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,856
- I'LL--I'LL HEAD DOWN
TO PAYROLL.

264
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,024
- [clears throat]
NOW.

265
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,693
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER.

266
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,128
- YES, MA'AM.

267
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:19,266
- SHE'S THE COLD, DISTANT MOTHER

268
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,935
I NEVER HAD.

269
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,837
I LOVE HER.

270
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,241
- [whistling]

271
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,810
GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.

272
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,245
- GOOD MORNING, SIR.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

273
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,281
- RON?
YOUR MOUSTACHE FELL OFF.

274
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,316
- [laughs]

275
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,317
LESLIE, YOU GOOFBALL.

276
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,019
[laughs]

277
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:40,754
TAMMY POINTED OUT THAT
MY FACE LOOKED BETTER

278
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:41,889
WITHOUT ANY HAIR ON IT.

279
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,691
AND IT COLLECT
A LOT OF FOOD CRUMBS,

280
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,326
WHICH IS VERY UNSANITARY.

281
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,294
HEY, JER.

282
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,830
HUMP DAY, AM I RIGHT, BUDDY?
[snaps fingers]

283
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,998
- WHAT?

284
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:51,999
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

285
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,000
WHERE'S TAMMY ONE?

286
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,001
- SHE MOVED IN WITH ME.

287
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,636
SHE'S REALLY HELPING ME OUT.

288
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,971
YESTERDAY, SHE CONVERTED
MY BANK ACCOUNT

289
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,940
INTO A JOINT BANK ACCOUNT
WITH HER.

290
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,108
- OH.
THAT'S GREAT.

291
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,010
AND HOW IS THAT GONNA HELP?

292
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,011
- NOT SURE.

293
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,746
WHEN SHE EXPLAINS IT,
IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE.

294
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,582
IT IS SO NICE
HAVING HER AROUND.

295
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:09,983
HERE'S SOMETHING NEAT.

296
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:11,351
TAMMY'S GOT ME
TAKING BABY ASPIRIN

297
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,955
TO LOWER
MY RISK OF HEART DISEASE.

298
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,857
SCIENCE IS A MIRACLE.

299
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,693
ANY-WHO,
BACK TO THE OLD GRINDSTONE.

300
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:21,695
THESE EMAILS AREN'T GONNA
SEND THEMSELVES.

301
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,664
[laughs]

302
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,033
- DIABETES CAN'T BE CURED.

303
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,968
BUT IT CAN BE PREVENTED.

304
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,237
MAKE A CHOICE.
MAKE A CHANGE.

305
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,371
AND TOGETHER,

306
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,340
WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

307
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,842
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ANY NOTES?

308
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,976
- GREAT.

309
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,310
JUST AS GOOD,
IF NOT EXACTLY THE SAME

310
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,211
AS THE LAST ONE.

311
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,147
IN THAT LAST ONE,
I LEFT A NANOSECOND

312
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,649
OF A PAUSE BETWEEN THE WORDS,

313
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,816
"TOGETHER" AND "WE."

314
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,884
IT FELT MUCH BETTER.

315
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,085
BUT I'D LOVE TO TRY ANOTHER ONE.

316
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,820
- I REALLY THINK WE'VE GOT IT.

317
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:47,955
- ANN.

318
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,022
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME

319
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,357
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU.

320
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,959
I MEAN, YOU SPENT
A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY

321
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:52,960
ON WRITING THIS.

322
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:53,994
- NOT REALLY.

323
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,963
- SO, IT NEEDS TO BE PERFECT.

324
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,665
SO, LET'S DO 1 MORE,
THEN 5 MORE,

325
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,667
THEN 20 IN A ROW.

326
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,002
- HEY,
LOOK WHO IT IS.

327
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,103
- HEY, HEY.

328
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,073
- TOM.
JEAN-RALPHIO.

329
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,908
PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYERS.

330
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,342
- 'SUP,
JELL-O SHOT.

331
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,244
- CAN I ASK YOU GUYS
A QUESTION?

332
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,046
HOW EXACTLY
ARE YOU MAKING MONEY?

333
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,947
- WANNA KNOW
HOW WE MAKE MONEY?

334
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,649
- DO YOU WANNA KNOW
HOW WE MAKE MONEY?

335
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:17,718
- BY LITERALLY
PRINTING OUT OUR MONEY.

336
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:20,053
- WE BOUGHT A PRINTING PRESS.

337
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,755
THIS PRINTS BILLS WITH OUR FACES

338
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,825
AND THE E720 LOGO ON THEM.

339
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,927
- AND PROMOTE THE COMPANY
BY GOING TO CLUBS

340
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,361
AND TOSSING THE BILLS
IN THE AIR AND SCREAMING,

341
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,097
"FREE MONEY!"

342
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,033
- YOU CAN'T JUST PRINT
YOUR OWN MONEY.

343
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,702
THIS HAS TO STOP,

344
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:35,703
RIGHT NOW.

345
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,739
[rap music]

346
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,013
- AWW!

347
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:46,914
- WHAT'S THE DEAL,
BABY?

348
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:47,848
ONE SECOND, YOU HIT
THE PARTY SWITCH,

349
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,282
AND THE NEXT SECOND,
YOU'RE ALL BUSINESS?

350
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,984
- I NEED TO SEE
ALL OF YOUR BOOKS.

351
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:51,985
- YOU GOT IT, BABY.

352
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,053
BABY!

353
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,054
GET HIM THE BOOKS.

354

- AWW, SNAPPLE.

355
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,124
ARE WE CALLING
EVERYBODY "BABY" NOW?

356
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,125
'CAUSE HONESTLY,

357
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,192
I LOVE THAT.

358
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,260
- ARE WE SAYING "SNAPPLE"

359
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:01,261
ANYTIME WE THINK
SOMETHING'S DOPE?

360
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,329
'CAUSE I LOVE THAT, BABY.

361
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,330
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE?

362
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,331
[whistles]

363
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,432
JELL-O SHOT!

364
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,101
[rap music plays]
- UH-OH!

365
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,137
HIBBERT, HIBBERT.

366
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,205
all: HUP, JELL-O SHOT!

367
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,874
JELL-O SHOT!

368
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,208
JELL-O SHOT!

369
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,209
JELL-O SHOT!

370
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,277
- THANK YOU.

371
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,445
- WE'RE HERE TO SERVE YOU,
FRIEND.

372
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,214
I HOPE THE REST OF YOUR DAY
IS COOL BEANS.

373
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:22,015
- RON,

374
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,017
WHAT IS THIS MEMO
YOU SENT TO ME?

375
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,086
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO THE BATTLE ROYALE?

376
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,221
- I HAVE DECIDED
NOT TO ATTEND THIS YEAR.

377
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,790
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S DISTURBING

378
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,792
THAT YOU WROTE A MEMO,
AT ALL.

379
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,461
BUT YOU LOVE ARGUING AGAINST
GOVERNMENT SPENDING.

380
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,863
WHY DO YOU NOT WANNA
DO IT NOW?

381
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,130
- LESLIE, PLEASE.

382
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,132
THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS
WHAT IT'S DOING.

383
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,200
I'M CONFIDENT THAT I'LL--

384
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,369
OUCHIE.

385
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,137
- YOU AND I ARE GOING TO LUNCH.

386
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,839
WE HAVE TO TALK.

387
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,908
- LET ME JUST CALL TAMMY FIRST
AND GET PERMISSION.

388
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,811
- OH, COME ON.

389
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:51,912
- TAMMY,

390
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:55,082
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
GO TO LUNCH WITH LESLIE?

391
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,083
TERRIFIC.

392
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,084
BYE.

393
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,251
SHE SAYS I CAN'T GO.

394
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,987
- YOU'RE GOING TO LUNCH WITH ME.

395
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,223
I SAY YOU CAN GO.

396
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,058
- OH, GOSH.

397
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,259
I'M REALLY IN A PICKLE NOW.

398
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,494
- OH, MY GOD.

399
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,162
WHEN RON FALLS FOR TAMMY TWO,

400
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,331
HE TURNS
INTO A DEMONIC SEX MANIAC.

401
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,365
BUT THIS?

402
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,366
NEUTERED WIMP?

403
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,434
THIS IS WORSE.

404
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,170
OPERATION GOLDEN DOVE
IS IN TROUBLE.

405
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,239
RON, THERE ARE SOME THINGS
I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT

406
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,942
BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE
HOW TO PHRASE THEM.

407
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,510
- JUST BLURT THEM
RIGHT OUT, LESLIE.

408
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,313
ANYTHING YOU SAY WILL STAY
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

409
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,480
RIGHT, MY LOVE?

410
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,782
- STOP FIDGETING.

411
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:29,649
- SORRY.

412
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,484
- I WAS HOPING TO SPEAK
WITH RON ALONE.

413
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:32,886
- HE WANTS ME HERE.

414
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,254
HE INVITED ME.

415
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,056
NA-NA-NA-NA-NA.

416
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,257
- DON'T WORRY, LESLIE.

417
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,226
TAMMY'S TOTALLY COOL.

418
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,227
- HUH, OKAY.

419
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,328
THEN I'LL SAY IT TO HER.

420
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,963
YOU'RE EVIL,
AND YOU NEED TO GO.

421
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,497
[both chuckle]

422
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,067
- LESLIE, YOU ARE A PANIC.

423
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,202
TAMMY,
MAY I USE THE RESTROOM?

424
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:53,506
- REMEMBER TO WASH YOUR HANDS.

425
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,075
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

426
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,077
LET'S CUT THE CRAP.

427
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,012
IS THIS AUDIT EVEN REAL?

428
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:01,281
- IN A SENSE, YES.

429
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,817
BUT IN ANOTHER, TRUER SENSE, NO,

430
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,252
IT IS NOT.

431
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,887
I WANT RONALD BACK,

432
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,321
BUT I HAD TO LEARN
ABOUT HIS FINANCES,

433
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,390
TO MAKE SURE MY FUTURE
WAS PROTECTED.

434
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,825
I'M IMPRESSED.

435
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:14,962
HE'S ACQUIRED
QUITE A BIT OF GOLD.

436
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:18,231
- YOU GOLD DIGGER.

437
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:21,969
YOU'RE LITERALLY A GOLD DIGGER.

438
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:26,006
- THE THING I LOVE ABOUT TAMMY
IS SHE CALLS ME ON MY CRAP.

439
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,807
EVERY GUY NEEDS THAT.

440
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,115
- OKAY, IF YOU WANT
THIS COMPANY TO SURVIVE,

441
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,884
YOU IMMEDIATELY NEED TO
DOWNSIZE.

442
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,485
I MEAN, YOU DON'T NEED
THIS AIRPLANE HANGAR.

443
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,686
- UM, I THINK WE DO.

444
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:43,991
- AND TWO, YOU HAVE TO KEEP
DETAILED FINANCIAL RECORDS.

445
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,125
- THANK YOU!

446
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,326
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL THEM THAT!

447
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,627
- WASTE OF TIME.

448
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,596
THEY WOULDN'T KNOW
A NON-EMPLOYEE TAX-REPORTABLE

449
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,365
EXPENDITURE REQUEST
IF IT BIT THEM IN THE ASS.

450
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,202
- HEY GUYS, WHICH TWO PEOPLE
HERE STARTED THEIR OWN COMPANY?

451
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,570
'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE
IT WASN'T YOU TWO BOZOS.

452
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:58,638
- HEY!

453
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,408
- LOOK, YOU GUYS CAN SWAGGER
AROUND ALL YOU WANT,

454
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,377
BUT BUSINESSES NEED REVENUE,
OKAY?

455
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:07,247
UNLESS YOU START WORKING
ON AN ACTUAL PLAN,

456
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,248
YOU'RE DEAD IN A MONTH.

457
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,316
THAT'S A FACT.

458
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,984
- BEN,
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

459
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,385
BUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

460
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,187
AS FAR AS BUSINESS DECISIONS GO,

461
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,923
I THINK WE KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

462
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:19,226
DON'T FORGET TO GRAB A FREE iPad
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

463
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,061
- HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE ONE.

464
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,062
- DIABETES!

465
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,364
FIGHT IT!

466
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,499
NOT QUITE, BUT I LIKE THE
ENERGY--ARE WE STILL ROLLING?

467
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,268
- YUP.

468
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,102
- DIABETES!

469
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:31,004
- OKAY, LET'S--CAN WE TAKE
A BREAK?

470
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,139
- I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

471
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,473
I THINK WE ALMOST HAVE IT,

472
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,675
AND I AM VERY EXCITED
AT THAT PROSPECT.

473
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,011
I'LL CANCEL MY FOUR O'CLOCK
AND MY FIVE O'CLOCK

474
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,579
AND MY SIX O'CLOCK APPOINTMENTS.

475
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,548
- I CANNOT BELIEVE
I DATED HIM.

476
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,383
FOR A LONG TIME.

477
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,252
AND HE BROKE UP WITH ME!

478
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,254
- FAT EQUALS SPLAT!

479
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,122
AS IN, "YOU'RE DEAD!"

480
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:50,123
IS THERE SOMETHING THERE?

481
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:51,124
NO--NO.
THAT--THAT SUCKED.

482
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,292
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.

483
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,393
I'M FEELING IT--
LET'S GO RIGHT AWAY!

484
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,394
IT'S MAGIC TIME!

485
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,396
FROM THE TOP, EVERYBODY.

486
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,431
- THERE'S NO ONE ELSE HERE.

487
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,700
- BASICALLY, WE'RE BEING
ATTACKED BY GODZILLA.

488
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,303
AND TO BEAT GODZILLA,
WE NEED MOTHRA.

489
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,371
NO OFFENSE.

490
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,174
- NONE TAKEN.
I'M VERY FLATTERED.

491
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,141
- WHO'S THIS?

492
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:09,209
WHO'S THIS TALL DRINK OF WATER?

493
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,210
- ANDY.

494
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,444
- HEY, ANDY.

495
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:12,512
HOW'S IT HANGING?

496
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:16,083
- LISTEN, WE NEED YOU TO BREAK
RON FROM HER SPELL.

497
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,551
CAN'T YOU JUST MOVE
YOUR BUTT AROUND,

498
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,587
OR WEAR A DRESS
MADE OUT OF MEAT?

499
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,156
- WELL I COULD DO
ALL THOSE THINGS AND HAVE,

500
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,092
BUT THAT BITCH IS CRAZY.

501
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:29,162
WHEN RON LEFT HER
AND WE GOT TOGETHER,

502
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,597
SHE THREW ACID ON MY FOOT.

503
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,731
- EWW!

504
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,533
- COULD WE TAKE A PEEK AT IT?

505
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:37,437
- LISTEN, TAMMY ONE WAS
MY SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER, TOO.

506
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,272
SHE CAN PINPOINT
YOUR WEAKNESSES,

507
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:42,709
AND THEN DESTROY YOU
WITH JUST ONE WORD.

508
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,044
AND A JAR OF ACID.

509
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,278
- OH, MY GOD.

510
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,614
- I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA
THAT COULD SAVE RON.

511
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,416
- ANDY, DON'T JOKE AROUND.

512
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,986
- I HAVE IDEAS, TOO.

513
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,354
- YOU WERE RIGHT
TO COME GET ME.

514
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,024
MY SON RONNIE ALWAYS HAD
A WEAKNESS FOR THOSE LADIES.

515
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,025
- OH, WOW.

516
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,192
IS THIS RON?

517
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:00,760
- YUP.
AT THE AGE OF FIVE.

518
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,295
HE'S STANDING NEXT
TO THE FIRST CHAIR

519
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,296
HE EVER BUILT.

520
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,199
- OH, MY GOD!

521
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:09,202
THERE'S A ROOM
FULL OF JUST GUNS.

522
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,471
- WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY GUNS?

523
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,106
- THIS IS AMERICA, ISN'T IT?

524
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,141
- YES.

525
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,176
- THEN I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER
STUPID QUESTIONS

526
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,245
WHILE STANDING
ON MY OWN PROPERTY.

527
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,180
LET'S GO.
[whistles]

528
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,415
- OKAY. WELL,
IT'S DEFINITELY RON'S MOM.

529
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,753
- TAMMY.

530
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,155
- TAMMY.

531
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,156
- RONNIE.

532
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,423
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

533
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,292
- WELCOME
TO THE BATTLE ROYALE.

534
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,793
RIGHT HERE.
RIGHT NOW.

535
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,463
OPERATION SOARING FALCON

536
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,032
IS IN ITS FINAL STAGES.

537
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,801
- IT'S TIME TO SETTLE THIS.

538
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,803
- AH.

539
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,539
AN OLD-FASHIONED
PRAIRIE DRINK-OFF.

540
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,141
- WHAT'S IN THAT JUG?

541
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,110
IT SMELLS LIKE JET FUEL.

542
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,512
- THAT'S SWANSON FAMILY
MASH LIQUOR.

543
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,782
MADE FROM THE FINEST CORN
EVER GROWN ON AMERICAN SOIL.

544
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,784
ITS ONLY LEGAL USE
IS TO STRIP VARNISH

545
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,053
OFF OF SPEEDBOATS.

546
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,788
- IF YOU WIN,
HE'S ALL YOURS.

547
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,523
AND IF I WIN, I BRING HIM
BACK TO THE FARM

548
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:04,657
FOR GOOD.

549
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,359
- WAIT, WHAT?
THAT WASN'T THE DEAL.

550
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:07,660
- POUR IT.
I'M THIRSTY.

551
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,661
- POUR ME ONE, TOO,
THEN.

552
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:09,796
LET ME IN HERE.

553
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,799
I'M GONNA JOIN YOU AND IF I WIN,

554
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,434
RON STAYS HERE WITH US.

555
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,702
- LESLIE, NO,
DON'T DRINK THAT.

556
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:20,039
WE USE IT TO BURN WARTS
OFF OF THE MULES!

557
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,617
- POISON!

558
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,152
UGH!

559
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,287
I MADE A MISTAKE.

560
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,524
I MADE A MISTAKE.

561
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,692
- HOW WERE WE TOGETHER
FOR FIVE MONTHS?

562
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,861
- WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S POSSIBLE
YOU CAN JUST DATE A GUY

563
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,398
BECAUSE OF WHERE YOU ARE
IN YOUR LIFE EMOTIONALLY.

564
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,533
- YEAH, I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT,
JOHN.

565
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,634
- ANN PERKINS,

566
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,403
I HATE TO SAY THIS,
BUT I HAVE A STAIN ON MY SHIRT.

567
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,273
WHICH MEANS THAT EVERYTHING
WE SHOT SO FAR IS UNUSABLE,

568
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,874
BUT LET'S USE THIS
AS AN OPPORTUNITY

569
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,709
TO REVISIT THE SCRIPT.

570
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,810
DELIVERY GUY.

571
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,212
- HEY.
- DIABETES!

572
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,216
- HAD ENOUGH?

573
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,552
- OF THIS WATERED-DOWN
BABY FORMULA?

574
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,819
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

575
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,656
- NOT MEVEN CLARSE.

576
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,725
MARVIN CLODS.

577
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,261
GLENN CLOSE.

578
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:15,795
- LESLIE, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS...

579
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:20,567
- SHH!
GO TO BED, JIMMY.

580
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,568
WRAH!

581
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,536
I CAN'T FEEL MY FACE.

582
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,871
MY FACE IS NUMB.

583
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,639
[hissing]

584
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,645
WHAT IS THAT?

585
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,183
- AND TOGETHER,
WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

586
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,384
THAT'S IT.

587
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,286
I THINK WE GOT IT.
DO YOU THINK WE GOT IT?

588
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,488
- YES! YEAH, WE HAVE IT.

589
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,656
WE HAD IT SEVEN HOURS AGO.

590
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,625
- OH, ANN, I--I KNOW THAT
I CAN BE INTENSE,

591
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,561
BUT I'M ONLY TRYING TO BE
THE BEST ME THAT I CAN BE.

592
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,563
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY

593
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:51,698
AND YOUR PATIENCE,

594
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:55,768
AND YOUR INTELLIGENCE,
AND YOUR INSIGHT.

595
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,938
YOU REALLY ARE
AN AMAZING HUMAN BEING.

596
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,175
- THANK YOU.

597
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:05,445
- OH, RIGHT--
THAT'S WHY I DATED HIM.

598
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:07,747
- HEY.

599
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,916
- I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

600
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,785
WE BROUGHT IN FIVE ACCOUNTANTS
TO LOOK AT E720

601
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,754
AND THEY ALL SAID
THE SAME THING YOU DID.

602
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:15,822
IF WE DON'T START
MAKING CHANGES,

603
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:16,789
WE'RE GONNA LOSE THE COMPANY.

604
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,326
- OKAY. WELL,
FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO:

605
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,793
GET RID OF FOUR
OF THOSE ACCOUNTANTS.

606
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,729
YOU DON'T NEED FIVE ACCOUNTANTS.

607
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,431
- AGAIN, GOOD ADVICE.

608
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,233
HERE.

609
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,469
- YOU REALLY--YOU NEED TO STOP
GIVING THESE AWAY LIKE CANDY.

610
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,837
- I BOUGHT THAT ONE PERSONALLY.

611
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,871
AS A THANK-YOU.

612
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,875
IT'S A iPad.

613
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,211
- * EVERYBODY PRANCE, NOW!

614
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:40,347
* PRANCE, PRANCE, PRANCE,
PRANCE, PRANCE, PRANCE *

615
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,748
- SHE'S HAD ENOUGH.
CALL IT OFF.

616
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,750
- THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.
SHE'S OUT.

617
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:44,917
- WAIT.
I'M SUBBING IN.

618
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,786
- APRIL, NO--THAT STUFF
WILL MELT

619
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,621
THE SHELL OFF A GARDEN SNAIL.

620
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:49,456
- WHATEVER.

621
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,591
I'M PUERTO RICAN.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

622
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,630
[sputters]
[bleep], OH, MY GOD!

623
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:58,631
- OKAY.

624
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:01,668
THIS ENDS NOW.

625
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,486
- AH.

626
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,455
- MOM, YOU'RE GOING
BACK TO THE FARM.

627
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:23,823
AND YOU,

628
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,024
YOU'RE GOING BACK TO HELL.

629
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,025
- FINE.

630
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,727
I GOT WHAT I CAME FOR ANYWAY.

631
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,028
I FOUND YOUR UNDERGROUND SAFE.

632
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,730
I STOLE HALF YOUR GOLD.

633
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,599
- THAT'S DECOY GOLD.

634
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:33,466
YOU THINK I'D LEAVE MY GOLD

635
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,435
IN A LOCKED SAFE
BURIED UNDERGROUND,

636
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,537
WHERE ANYONE COULD FIND IT?

637
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,905
YOU DON'T KNOW ME AT ALL.

638
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:39,739
- YES, I DO.

639
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,841
I KNEW YOU THE MINUTE
YOU WERE BORN.

640
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:47,547
AND I INTEND TO BE THERE
THE MINUTE YOU DIE.

641
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,684
- RON,
YOUR FAMILY'S WEIRD.

642
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:54,186
- LITERALLY, THERE'S A--
SOMEONE READING A MAGAZINE

643
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,488
AND SOMEONE
APPLYING NAIL POLISH.

644
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:58,925
WHAT'S THAT--WHAT IS SHE DOING?
SHE'S JUST PLAYING WITH AN iPad.

645
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:03,330
TOM TOLD ME THAT CHAIR
WAS $27,000.

646
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,797
THAT CHAIR THAT HAS A ROOF.

647
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:08,368
THE--THERE'S SOMEONE OVER THERE
IN A DEEP SLEEP.

648
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:12,539
SHE'S PROBABLY BEING PAID
UPWARDS OF $100,000 A YEAR.

649
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:15,608
THERE'S THIS VIDEO OF A BOAT.

650
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,577
LOOK AT THAT THING.
WHAT IS THAT?

651
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,979
WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH THAT THING?
