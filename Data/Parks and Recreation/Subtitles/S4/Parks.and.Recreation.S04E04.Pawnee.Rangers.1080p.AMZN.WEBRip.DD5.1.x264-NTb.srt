THERE WILL BE NO VIDEO GAMES.

00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:08,642
THERE WILL BE
NO INTERNET PADS.

4
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,811
THIS WEEKEND
YOU HAVE TWO PARENTS:

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,514
ME AND MOTHER NATURE.

6
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,249
- AND I...

7
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:17,685
AM MOTHER NATURE'S BROTHER:

8
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:18,686
BROTHER NATURE.

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,088
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME ANDY.

10
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,290
OR BROTHER NATURE.

11
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:23,791
YOUR CALL.

12
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,459
- THANK YOU, ANDY.
- BROTHER NATURE.

13
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,261
- FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS,

14
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:30,564
I HAVE SERVED AS TROOP LEADER
OF THE PAWNEE RANGERS.

15
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,600
THIS IS OUR HANDBOOK.

16
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,737
I WROTE THE WHOLE THING MYSELF.

17
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,439
- OKAY, IT'S TIME
TO GIVE OUT THE BADGES.

18
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,573
UM, LET'S SEE.

19
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:42,143
EMILY, YOU GET THE BADGE
FOR MOST COMMUNITY SERVICE.

20
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,043
[applause]

21
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:46,414
TO CASEY,

22
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:47,448
[applause]

23
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,449
TO ABIGAIL,

24
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,484
FLYEST HAIRSTYLE.

25
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,853
AND ANN GETS THE BADGE
FOR SECOND-FLYEST HAIRSTYLE.

26
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,655
- OH!
I WASN'T COMPETING FOR THAT.

27
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:55,756
- I'LL SAY.

28
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,957
FIVE YEARS AGO,

29
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,128
A PLUCKY FIFTH-GRADER WANTED
TO JOIN THE PAWNEE RANGERS,

30
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:02,863
BUT THEIR EXECUTIVE COUNCIL SAID
WHAT OBNOXIOUS JERKS ALWAYS SAY.

31
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,632
"NO. THIS IS MALES-ONLY.

32
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:05,766
GO START YOUR OWN CLUB."

33
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,668
SHE COULDN'T.

34
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,537
SO I DID.

35
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,838
WE'RE CALLED
THE PAWNEE GODDESSES,

36
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,307
AND WE'RE FREAKIN' AWESOME.

37
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:15,343
HEY, RON, WHOSE CLUB
DO YOU THINK IS BETTER,

38
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:16,677
YOURS OR MINE?

39
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,279
THE ANSWER IS MINE.
SAY MINE IS BETTER.

40
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,713
- IT'S NOT A COMPETITION.

41
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,349
- OH, BUT IT IS.

42
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,484
YOUR CLUB MADE IT A COMPETITION
WHEN THEY KEPT GIRLS OUT.

43
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,386
[as a Southern belle]
OH, MY STARS.

44
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,854
I'M JUST A LITTLE LADY.

45
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:30,291
MY FRAGILE CONSTITUTION CANNOT
HANDLE THE FEARSOME OUTDOORS.

46
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:32,560
- I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH STRONG WOMEN, LESLIE.

47
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,195
WHO'S LESLIE?

48
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:36,664
MY NAME IS ANNABELLE VANDERGRAF,

49
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,499
AND, Y'ALL,

50
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,700
I JUST FALL TO PIECES

51
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,502
WHEN THE SUN SHINES

52
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,604
ON MY HAIR--ED.

53
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:47,275
- HOWEVER, THE PAWNEE RANGERS
WERE FOUNDED BECAUSE SOME BOYS

54
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,443
WANT TO GO OUT INTO NATURE

55
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:51,512
AND LEARN
TRADITIONAL SURVIVAL SKILLS

56
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,381
WITHOUT BEING DISTRACTED
BY GIRLS.

57
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,349
- WELL, MY AWESOME GODDESSES
DON'T WANT TO BE DISTRACTED

58
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:57,285
BY LOSERS.

59
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:58,286
SAY MY CLUB IS BETTER, RON.

60
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,553
SAY IT.

61
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:00,621
MY CLUB IS BETTER.

62
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,789
SAY IT.

63
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,357
COME ON. SAY IT'S BETTER.

64
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:04,492
SAY IT.

65
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:05,693
SAY IT'S BETTER.
SAY MY CLUB IS BETTER.

66
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:06,694
SAY IT. GIVE IT UP.

67
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:07,695
WHOSE CLUB IS BETTER? MINE.

68
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:08,696
SAY IT. YOU KNOW IT.

69
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,431
SAY IT.

70
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,599
- ON PRINCIPAL,
I NEVER SAY ANYTHING

71
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,735
THAT ANOTHER PERSON IS OBVIOUSLY
TRYING TO GET ME TO SAY.

72
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,937
MY FIRST WEDDING CEREMONY
TOOK TWO HOURS,

73
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,408
BECAUSE AFTER THE PRIEST SAID
"REPEAT AFTER ME"

74
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:23,344
I FELL SILENT.

75
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,347
[triumphant music]

76
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,386
*

77
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,733
- I'VE BEEN AUDITING
THE BUDGET, AND I NOTICED

78
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,768
YOU'RE WAY BEHIND
ON YOUR PAPERWORK.

79
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,971
UH, JERRY, YOU HAVEN'T
FILLED OUT A PC-10 FORM

80
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,940
IN TWO AND A HALF YEARS.

81
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,542
- AW, JEEZ, I'M SORRY.

82
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,977
- YEAH, WE KINDA DO
OUR PAPERWORK AT OUR OWN SPEED.

83
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,379
- OH, REALLY?

84
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,913
WELL, I KINDA NEED YOU
TO DO IT AT MY SPEED.

85
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:02,883
- FINE, I'LL DO THEM.

86
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:03,984
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU TODAY?

87
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:04,885
DID THEY CANCEL
GAME OF THRONES?

88
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,321
- NOTHING IS WRONG,
JUST DO YOUR JOB.

89
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:12,926
AND THEY WOULD
NEVER CANCEL GAME OF THRONES.

90
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,827
IT'S A CROSSOVER HIT.

91
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,963
IT'S NOT JUST
FOR FANTASY ENTHUSIASTS.

92
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,866
THEY'RE TELLING HUMAN STORIES
IN A FANTASY WORLD.

93
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,737
FILL OUT THE FORMS, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

94
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,806
I USED TO HAVE
ONE REALLY GOOD REASON

95
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:26,807
FOR STAYING IN PAWNEE.

96
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,578
BUT NOW, I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S KEEPING ME HERE.

97
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,381
ALTHOUGH,
I AM JUST TWO SANDWICHES AWAY

98
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,883
FROM A FREE MEATBALL SUB.

99
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,621
THIS IS EXPIRED.

100
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:44,325
[girls squealing]

101
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,860

- WHAT IS THIS?

105
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,738
- THAT IS A CANVAS SHEET,

106
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,608
THE MOST VERSATILE OBJECT
KNOWN TO MAN.

107
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,810
IT CAN BE USED
TO MAKE TENTS, BACKPACKS,

108
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,512
SHOES, STRETCHERS,

109
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:05,913
SAILS, TARPAULINS,

110
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,982
AND I SUPPOSE, IN THE MOST
DIRE OF CIRCUMSTANCES,

111
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,619
IT CAN BE A SURFACE
ON WHICH TO MAKE

112
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:12,586
"ART."

113
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,854
- WHAT'S THE SECOND GIFT?

114
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,724
- THE SECOND GIFT
IS THE BOX ITSELF.

115
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,593
YOU HAVE 10 MINUTES
TO ASSEMBLE A SHELTER

116
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:22,363
USING ONLY YOUR TWO GIFTS.

117
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,364
GO.

THE GODDESS CABIN
HAS NEVER LOOKED BETTER.

IS GOING TO BE HOTLY CONTESTED.

122

OKAY,
SO WHAT DID EVERYBODY MAKE

00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,909
FOR THEIR
LOOSELY STRUCTURED CRAFT TIME?

124
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:36,910
LAUREN?

125
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,011

127
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,550
- AMAZING.
LAUREN, THAT'S SO GOOD!

128
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,018
I REALLY WOULDN'T
WANT TO FOLLOW THAT.

129
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,720
ANN?

130
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:47,688
- OH, BOY. UM...

131
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,859
I WAS MAKING
SOME CORNHUSK DOLLS FOR EVERYONE

132
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,694
BUT THEY KINDA TURNED OUT WRONG

133
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,729
SO THEY LOOK LIKE MONSTERS.

134
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,732
I'M SORRY.

135
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,969
I'M JUST GONNA
PUT THAT OVER THERE.

136
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,871
IN THE FIRE.

167
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:56,857
- MM-HMM?

168
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,626

ABOUT INVITING BEN

- BUT HE REALLY SEEMS
LIKE HE COULD USE A DAY OFF.

173
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,867
HE'S LIKE
A SKINNY LITTLE RUBBER BAND

174
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,602
THAT'S ABOUT TO SNAP IN HALF.

175
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,938
- EXACTLY.
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO RELAX.

176

00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,177
MY NUBIAN PRINCESS,
THIS IS OUR HOLY DAY.

180
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,913
IT'S THE ONE DAY A YEAR
I ALLOW MYSELF TO BE SELFISH.

181
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,114
- OOH, CUPCAKES.

182
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,916
- THOSE ARE ALL FOR ME, JERRY.

183
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,554
- THIS HOMEMADE BULGOGI
IS SO DELICIOUS, KAYLA.

184
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,088
THIS IS THE BEST KOREAN FOOD
I'VE EVER HAD.

185
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,823
I WOULD SAY
IT'S ALMOST AS GOOD AS

186
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,760
LUKEWARM BEANS FROM A CAN.

187
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,762
RIGHT, RON?

188
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,830
- I'M TRYING TO TEACH MY BOYS
ABOUT RATIONING FOOD,

189
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,899
AND YOUR SELF-INDULGENT

190
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,001
ETHNIC FOOD COURT ISN'T HELPING.

191
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,571
- GODDESSES, LET'S GO OVER
OUR SCHEDULE FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

192
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,873
WE HAVE HIKING,
AND THEN CAPTURE THE FLAG,

193
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,875
AND THEN A PUPPET SHOW
ABOUT THE BILL OF RIGHTS

194
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,811
SET TO "PARTY IN THE USA"
BY MILEY CYRUS,

195
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,980
AND THEN WE HAVE LASSO TRAINING,

196
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,915
AND A S'MORES-OFF.

197
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,917
[cheering]

198
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,152
- SO WHAT'S ON OUR SCHEDULE,
MR. SWANSON?

199
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:02,756
- WE HAVE ONE ACTIVITY PLANNED:

200
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,024
NOT GETTING KILLED.

201
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,697
- JERRY.

202
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,665
OH, EVERYBODY MUST BE
AT RANGERS WEEKEND.

203
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,467
- YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY
WAS A RANGER FOR 12 YEARS--

204
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,301
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.

205
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:15,669
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE THE DAY OFF.

206
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,605
YOU KNOW,
REST IS VERY IMPORTANT.

207
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:20,841
DID YOU KNOW THAT LAB RATS
WHO ARE DEPRIVED OF REST

208
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,843
GROW TUMORS
ALL OVER THEIR BODIES?

209
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,011
YOU SHOULD GOOGLE IT.
IT'S HORRIFYING.

210
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,513
- UH, THANK YOU. YES.

211
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,880
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA--

212
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:27,915
I'M GONNA GO HAVE LUNCH
WITH MY DAUGHTER!

213
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,149
YOU KNOW, CHRIS,
IF YOU WANTED,

214
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,051
YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOULD JOIN US FOR LUNCH.

215
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,720
MY DAUGHTER,
SHE'S REALLY SWEET.

216
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,221
- I WOULD LOVE TO, JERRY,
BUT I'M AFRAID THAT I AM BUSY.

217
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,789
I HAVE GOT TO RUN.

218
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:36,857
GOOGLE THOSE RAT TUMORS!

219
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,128
both: * TREAT YOURSELF 2011

220
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,263
- OH, LORD.

221
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,698
IS HE EATING SOUP?

222
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,266
ON A BENCH? ALONE?

223
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,902
- TOM.

224
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,070
- [sighs] FINE.

225
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,841
- COME ON, RUBBER BAND.
COME WITH US.

226
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:54,942
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU--

227
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,176
- NO ARGUING.

228
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,277
AND NO SOUP IN THE BENZ.

229
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,580
GET IN.
- WHA?

230
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:00,881
WHAT?

231
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:01,882
WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

232
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:05,919
[girls screaming]

233
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,154
[ukulele]

234
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,657
- GREAT PILLOW FIGHT, GIRLS.

235
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,525
THAT WAS ONE
OF OUR BEST ONES YET.

236
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,594
OKAY.
NOW IT'S TIME FOR AWARDS.

237
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,896
LULU GETS THE GOLDEN PILLOW.

238
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,899
AND THE SILVER PILLOW
GOES TO JANIE.

239
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:19,900
[knock at door]

240
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:20,901
OOH!

241
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:24,271
YES, WHAT IS IT?

242
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,273
- MS. KNOPE,

243
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,008
I DON'T LIKE
THE RANGERS ANYMORE.

244
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,911
I WANT TO BECOME
A PAWNEE GODDESS.

245
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:31,979
- I DID IT!

246
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,281
MY CLUB IS OFFICIALLY
THE BEST CLUB.

247
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,049
I WOULD GIVE MYSELF
A MERIT BADGE THAT SAYS

248
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,818
"BEST CLUB FOUNDER,"
BUT I DON'T HAVE ONE,

249
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,952
SO I'M GOING TO GIVE MYSELF

250
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:42,155
"PRETTIEST EYES"
AS A PLACEHOLDER.

251
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,891
I SECRETLY ALWAYS
WANTED THIS BADGE,

252
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,826
SO IT WORKS OUT GREAT.

253
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:48,962
- YOU WERE DEFECTING?

254
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,031
- I LIKE YOU, MR. SWANSON,
IT'S JUST...

255
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,066
ALL WE DO IS SIT IN SILENCE
AND EAT BEANS.

256
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,969
- THOSE BEANS WERE A REWARD.

257
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:56,970
- WELL, SEE, THE THING IS

258
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:57,971
THIS CLUB IS FOR GIRLS ONLY.

259
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,641
MAYBE YOU SHOULD START
YOUR OWN CLUB, FOR BOYS.

260
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,709
- GET BACK TO YOUR CANVAS BOX.

261
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,877
WE'LL DISCUSS THIS NO FURTHER.

262
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,813
AND I'LL THANK YOU
TO KEEP THE RUCKUS DOWN

263
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,148
SO MY BOYS CAN
FOCUS ON SOLITUDE.

264
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,183
- I'M SORRY, DARREN.
- LET'S GO.

265
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,055
- SO, TREAT YOURSELF DAY
IS JUST A DAY

266
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:18,258
WHERE YOU GO TO THE SPA
AND THEN THE MALL?

267
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,226
- [sighs]

268
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,761
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T GET IT.

269
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,130
- WELL, I'M A RELAXATION NOVICE.

270
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,131
GIVE ME SOME GUIDANCE.

271
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,933
- LISTEN TO ME, BEN-TO BOX,

272
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,968
THE POINT OF THIS
IS TO PAMPER YOURSELF.

273
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,237
JUST RELAAAX, MAN.

274
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,038
- I CAN'T.

275
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,006
SOMETHING ABOUT
THE SOUND OF HARPS

276
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,643
THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

277
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:36,977
OH, MY GOD!

278
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,211
- HI, DONNA.
- HEY.

279
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,180
RELAXATION LESSON NUMBER ONE:

280
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,049
ACUPUNCTURE.

281
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,184
IT'S GREAT FOR YOUR BACK,
AND YOUR REAR.

282
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,220
NEEDLES IN YOUR FACE,
PLEASURE IN YOUR BASE.

283
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,192
- [laughing] I KNOW.
- THAT'S MY BOSS.

284
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,861
[clears throat]
HEY, CHRIS.

285
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:57,130
UH, I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO MEET MY DAUGHTER, MILLICENT.

286
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,899
- WOW.

287
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,000
JERRY, GREAT JOB.

288
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,168
I'M YOUR DAD'S BOSS.

289
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,103
AND HIS MUCH-YOUNGER FRIEND.

290
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,738
- PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

291
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:05,906
- ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL?

292
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,676
I SAY SHE LOOKS
LIKE MY WIFE, GAYLE,

293
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,778
AND GAYLE AGREES.
[laughs]

294
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,946
SO, ANYWAY,
WE WERE GONNA GO TO LUNCH, SO--

295
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,849
- I RETROACTIVELY ACCEPT
YOUR ORIGINAL OFFER.

296
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:16,850
LET'S GO!

297
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,018
- LADIES, I JUST WANTED

298
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:21,154
TO THANK YOU FOR NOT CHEERING
WHEN I SENT DARREN AWAY.

299
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,290
- MS. KNOPE,
WASN'T DARREN JUST ASKING

300
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,058
FOR THE SAME EQUALITY
THAT YOU AND THE GODDESSES

301
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,095
WANTED FIVE YEARS AGO?

302
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,096
- IN A SENSE,

303
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,964
BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE COMPLICATED THAN--

304
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:32,299
- WASN'T YOUR ANSWER
THE VERY SAME THING

305
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,802
THAT THE RANGER COUNCIL
SAID TO YOU?

306
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:35,669
"STICK TO YOUR OWN KIND"?

307
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:38,238
- WHO WANTS
HOMEMADE PEANUT BRITTLE?

308
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,074
- MS. PERKINS, PLEASE,
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DEBATE.

309
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,676
- SORRY.

310
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,811
- COME ON, GODDESSES.

311
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,846
WE JUST STRUCK
A HUGE BLOW FOR EQUALITY

312
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,314
BY PROVING THAT
WE WERE BETTER THAN THEM.

313
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,348
- I DISAGREE.

314
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,183
- WHAT ABOUT A PUBLIC FORUM?

315
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,019
YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT
THERE'S NO BETTER SOLUTION

316
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:52,953
FOR A HOT-BUTTON ISSUE

317
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,789
THAN A GOOD OL'-FASHIONED
PUBLIC FORUM.

318
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:56,790
- [low]
GREAT IDEA, LAUREN.

319
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,091
- WHAT WAS THAT?

320
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,728
- I SAID,
"GREAT IDEA, LAUREN."

321
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,162
I'VE TAUGHT THEM TOO WELL.

322
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:05,165
I'VE CREATED A MOB OF
LITTLE LESLIE KNOPE MONSTERS.

323
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,433
I'M SO PROUD.

324
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,701
AND A LITTLE ANNOYED.

325
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,269
BUT MOSTLY PROUD.

326
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,804
70/30.

327
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,806
- JUST RELAX AND DON'T MOVE.

328
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,808
- OKAY. AH...

329
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,977
THIS IS THE MOST

330
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,880
STRESSED-OUT I'VE EVER BEEN

331
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:20,981
IN MY LIFE.

332
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,282
- BEN, LISTEN.

333
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,117
I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THINGS YOU LIKE

334
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,318
TO TAKE YOUR MIND
OFF THE NEEDLES, OKAY?

335
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,319
- [grunts]

336
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,089
- ACCOUNTING.

337
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,090
TRIGONOMETRY.

338
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,224
STAMPS, PROBABLY.

339
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:32,459
- MORE OF A RARE COINS GUY.

340
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,127
HELP ME. HELP ME!

341
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:37,831
- THERE IS NOTHING THAT I LIKE
MORE THAN RUNNING FOR CHARITY.

342
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,167
- YOU KNOW, LAST SUMMER
I DID A 50-MILE BIKE RIDE

343
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,102
FOR THE RED CROSS.
- YES, SHE DID.

344
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,236
- MILLICENT GERGICH,

345
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,372
BIKING FOR CHARITY IS LITERALLY

346
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,174
ONE OF MY INTERESTS ON FACEBOOK.

347
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,208
[all laugh]

348
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,177
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW ALIKE WE ARE.

349
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,813
- I KNOW, IT'S LIKE
WE'RE LITERALLY THE SAME PERSON.

350
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,515
- [laughs]

351
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,819
WE ARE HAVING A MOMENT.

352
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:01,254
- ATTENTION, EVERYONE.

353
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:03,156
WELCOME TO WONDER WEEKEND'S

354
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,893
FIRST-EVER PUBLIC FORUM.

355
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,360
OUR TOPIC TODAY?

356
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,962
SHOULD THE AMAZING GODDESSES

357
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:12,232
TAKE PITY ON THE ONCE-POWERFUL
PAWNEE RANGERS,

358
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,936
AND LET THEM INTO OUR
CLEARLY SUPERIOR ORGANIZATION?

359
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,971
RON, YOUR OPENING STATEMENT.

360
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,075
- THIS FORUM,
LIKE ALL PUBLIC FORUMS,

361
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,143
IS A WASTE OF TIME.

362
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,377
THANK YOU.

363
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,779
- POWERFUL STUFF.

364
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:28,215
OKAY. LET'S OPEN UP
THE FLOOR TO DEBATE.

365
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,883
WHO--YES, ABIGAIL.

366
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:33,020
- ISN'T IT LIKE BROWN VS.
THE BOARD OF EDUCATION?

367
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,088
SEPARATE BUT EQUAL
IS NEVER REALLY EQUAL.

368
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,223
WE SHOULD LET THE BOYS IN.

369
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,891
- MMM, INTERESTING. CASEY?

370
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:38,992
- I DISAGREE.

371
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,460
I THINK THERE'S A BENEFIT
TO EDUCATING THE GENDERS

372
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,561
SEPARATELY.

373
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,563
- I SEE WHERE
YOU'RE COMING FROM.

374
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,132
LET'S HEAR FROM A RANGER.

375
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,234
ANYONE? DARREN?

376
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,970
- IT'S COLD
AND DIRTY OUT HERE.

377
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,139
AND YOU GUYS HAVE CANDY.

378
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,540
I WANT THE CANDY.

379
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:56,276
- THE GODDESSES ARE MAKING
SOME WELL-INFORMED STATEMENTS,

380
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,011
BUT THE MOST COMPELLING POINT

381
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,047
IS FROM DARREN, ABOUT THE CANDY.

382
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,549
WE HAVE AMAZING CANDY IN THERE.

383
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,584
- WELCOME TO NIRVANA,

384
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,353
THE PLAZA AT EAGLETON.

385
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,121
THERE'S A REFLECTING POOL
OUT BACK,

386
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,157
THERE'S AN OLD-TIMEY TRAIN
THAT RUNS THROUGH THE MALL,

387
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,425
AND THREE BURBERRYS.

388
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,161
IF YOU TELL YOUR FRIEND,
"HEY, MEET ME AT BURBERRY,"

389
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,997
THEY GOTTA SPECIFY WHICH ONE.

390
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,165
- LET'S HIT IT.

391
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:20,533
- I REALLY WANT THIS DRESS,

392
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,369
AND I LIKE THIS CRYSTAL BEETLE,

393
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:26,106
BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE
AND THERE'S NO USE FOR IT.

394
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,374
- DONNA MEAGLE?

395
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,242
TREAT YOURSELF.

396
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,478
VELVET SLIPPIES,
CASHMERE SOCKS,

397
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,580
VELVET PANTS,
CASHMERE TURTLE.

398
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,348
I'M A CASHMERE-VELVET
CANDY CANE.

399
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,085
- TREAT YOURSELF.

400
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,452
- I MEAN, THIS IS INSANE.

401
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,322
- JERRY, A WORD?

402
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:43,423
- OF COURSE.

403
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,859
- I HAD AN AMAZING LUNCH.

404
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,161
I'VE ALREADY PASSED
THE KALE SALAD I HAD.

405
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,029
BUT, EVEN BETTER?

406
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,198
YOUR DAUGHTER
WAS DELIGHTFUL COMPANY.

407
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,866
NOW, I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU

408
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,301
IN AN AWKWARD POSITION, BUT--

409
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,269
- YOU WOULD LIKE
TO DATE MY DAUGHTER.

410
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,270
- YES!
BUT YOU ARE HER FATHER.

411
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,239
AND THAT IS A SACRED THING.

412
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,241
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND
THE NEXT 2 TO 4 DAYS WITH YOU

413
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,609
SO YOU CAN GET
TO KNOW ME BETTER,

414
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,277
TO FIND OUT IF I'M
THE KIND OF PERSON

415
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,013
WHO'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

416
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,214
THEN, YOU CAN COME WITH US

417
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,581
ON OUR FIRST 3 TO 6 DATES--

418
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,582
- CHRIS,
I APPRECIATE THE GESTURE,

419
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,118
IT'S VERY NICE,

420
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,920
BUT, MILLY,
SHE'S A GROWN WOMAN,

421
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,254
AND OF COURSE I TRUST HER.

422
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,256
AND I TRUST YOU.

423
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,357
- JERRY.

424
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,391
THANK YOU.

425
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,932
- MMM.

426
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,299
- BOYS, I'M TRYING
TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING

427
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,003
ABOUT NATURE AND SELF-RELIANCE.

428
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,372
NOTHING BEATS HARD WORK
AND DETERMINATION.

429
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,074
- IS THIS
THE PAWNEE GODDESSES?

430
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,075
I'VE GOT
THE PUPPIES YOU ORDERED.

431
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:35,875
- OH!

432
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,544
THE PUPPIES
FOR THE PUPPY PARTY

433
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,946
THAT WE'RE HAVING
IN OUR CABIN?

434
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:39,947
THOSE PUPPIES?

435
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,948
- WHAT?

436
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,215
NOO!

437
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,617
[laughing and fawning]

438
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,456
- MAN, DID YOU BUY ANYTHING
FOR YOURSELF TODAY?

439
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,924
- YEAH, I GOT THIS
PACK OF SOCKS.

440
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:51,925
- PLAIN WHITE SOCKS?

441
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,126
THAT'S NOT A TREAT!

442
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,127
DONNA!

443
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:55,328
GET ME AWAY FROM HIM.

444
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,464
- LOOK. MAYBE THIS IS OUR
VERSION OF TREAT YOURSELF DAY

445
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,166
AND HE NEEDS TO DO HIS VERSION.

446
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,267
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

447
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,635
- WYATT, IF YOU COULD BLOW
BIG MONEY ON ONE THING--

448
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,137
NOT SOCK MONEY--

449
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:07,107
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

450
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,679
- OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

451
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,147
THIS IS A WHOLE NEW
LEVEL OF NERD.

452
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,183
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

453
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,184
WHAT AM I DOING?

454
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:17,985
- WAIT. NO, NO, NO, NO.

455
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,586
I MEAN THAT
IN A GOOD WAY, BEN.

456
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,121
LISTEN TO ME,

457
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,190
YOU'RE PART OF THE
TREAT YOURSELF TEAM NOW, OKAY?

458
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,092
IF THAT COSTUME
SOMEHOW MAKES YOU HAPPY,

459
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,994
YOU'RE GONNA BUY IT.

460
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,129
AND YOU'RE GONNA WEAR IT
OUT OF THE STORE, OKAY?

461
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,130
YOU'RE GONNA TREAT YOURSELF.

462
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,131
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

463
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,199
I'M GONNA DO THAT.

464
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,533
I'M GONNA--

465
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,235
I'M GONNA TREAT MYSELF.

466
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,270
THANKS, YOU GUYS.

467
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,209
[crying]
THANK YOU.

468
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,077
I REALLY NEEDED THIS.

469
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,445
[sobbing]

470
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:49,449
I'M GONNA TREAT MYSELF.

471
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,219
- UH-OH. BATMAN'S CRYING.

472
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:54,454
- I AM A GODDESS.

473
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,124
A GLORIOUS FEMALE WARRIOR.

474
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,059
all:
I AM A GODDESS.

475
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,428
A GLORIOUS FEMALE WARRIOR.

476
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,663
QUEEN OF ALL THAT I SURVEY.

477
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,067
all:
QUEEN OF ALL THAT I SURVEY.

478
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,302
ENEMIES OF FAIRNESS
AND EQUALITY,

479
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,204
HEAR MY WOMANLY ROAR.

480
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:14,407
all: ENEMIES OF FAIRNESS
AND EQUALITY,

481
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:17,310
HEAR MY WOMANLY ROAR.

482
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,446
[screams]

483
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,715
[all scream]

484
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,317
- CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU ARE NOW GODDESSES.

485
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,153
- OH, MY GOD!

486
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,120
[applause and cheers]

487
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,122
- NOW, HAVE YOURSELVES

488
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,123
A PUPPY PARTY.

489
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,159
[puppies barking]

490
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,999
OH, BOY.

491
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,770
- HEY.

492
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,005
CAN I SIT DOWN?

493
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,477
LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

494
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,480
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT
FOR THE PAWNEE RANGERS,

495
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,782
EVEN IF THEY WERE JERKS
FIVE YEARS AGO.

496
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,717
YOU'RE NOT A JERK.

497
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,687
YOU'RE A GOOD TROOP LEADER.

498
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,323
- NOT FOR THESE TIMES I'M NOT.

499
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,692
IT'S TAKEN ME A WHILE
TO SEE THIS,

500
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,561
BUT THESE KIDS...

501
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,697
I DON'T UNDERSTAND 'EM.

502
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,799
AND THEY CERTAINLY
DON'T UNDERSTAND ME.

503
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,567
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

504
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,269
- NO, IT IS.

505
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,304
AND IT'S OKAY.

506
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,272
PEOPLE CHANGE.

507
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,341
THEIR INTERESTS CHANGE.

508
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,311
IT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD.

509
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:27,580
WHEN DID KIDS GET
SO INTERESTED IN FUN?

510
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,084
AH...

511
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:34,387
I'M GONNA TURN IN.

512
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:37,190
YOU WERE RIGHT, BY THE WAY.

513
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,192
YOUR GROUP IS BETTER.

514
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,100
- WHAT'S WRONG?
OUT WITH IT.

515
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:50,637
- I WAS...SEEING A WOMAN,

516
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,639
UH, FOR A WHILE, AND THEN

517
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,841
WE STOPPED SEEING EACH OTHER.

518
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,544
UH, PRETTY RECENTLY.

519
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,779
- THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN
OFF YOUR GAME.

520
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,781
- SORRY, DOG.

521
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,150
- YOU'RE A CATCH, WYATT.

522
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,884
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

523
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,619
- THERE'S CHICKENHEADS
EVERYWHERE, BEN.

524
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:07,887
CHICKENHEADS ALL AROUND
THIS MALL.

525
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,822
YOU'RE GONNA FIND ONE,
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.

526
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:10,823
BUT, FOR NOW,
WHY DON'T YOU LET IT OUT?

527
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,859
TREAT YOURSELF
TO A GOOD CRY.

528
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:15,895
ONE QUESTION, THOUGH.

529
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,797
- YEAH?

530
