TALKING ABOUT YOU,

MY PARENTS' METHOD
OF PROBLEM-SOLVING

OF YOUR ESTABLISHMENTS.

176
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:11,539
- MM, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU BUY
A SALAD AT SUE'S SALADS.

177
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,841
- THAT'S 'CAUSE I DON'T
HATE MYSELF, TANYA.

178
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:14,942
I'M SORRY.

179
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,610
I KNOW I SHOULD BE
CHASING YOUR VOTE,

180
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:19,079
BUT I STAND BEHIND MY DECISION
TO AVOID SALAD

181
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,414
AND OTHER DISGUSTING THINGS.

182
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,815
AND I THINK I HAVE
A LOT OF SUPPORT

183
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,917
IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THAT.

184
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,520
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS SEEMS
LIKE A PARTY FOR TOM'S FACE,

185
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,121
UH, I THINK
IT'S GOING PRETTY WELL.

186
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:31,592
WHEN IN DOUBT,
IN PAWNEE, SLAM SALAD.

187
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,793
I'M JUST
ESPECIALLY THANKFUL

188
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:33,894
THAT YOU COULD COME,
MR. PRESIDENT.

189
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,629
- MARTIN.
- MARTIN.

190
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,665
- YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL, RIGHT?

191
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,199
- NO. YES. WELL...

192
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,934
IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT.
I BARELY DID ANYTHING.

193
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,436
I HELD THEM BACK ACTUALLY.

194
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,739
THEY SUCCEEDED
DESPITE ME.

195
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,508
I'M SORRY. I WORKED
VERY HARD ON THAT EVENT.

196
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,876
I'M JUST...

197
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,911
BUREAUCRATS AREN'T USED TO
BRAGGING ABOUT THEMSELVES.

198
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,513
- [chuckles]

199
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,981
- TOM, COME OVER HERE AND TALK
ABOUT HOW GREAT I AM.

200
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,883
- * MARTIN

201
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,551
TOM HAVERFORD.
I THREW THIS SHINDIG.

202
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:58,919
- YES. TOM, TELL MARTIN
HOW HARD I WORKED

203
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,454
ON THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

204
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:03,023
- IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

205
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,091
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL

206
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,859
IS WHAT LAUNCHED
ENTERTAINMENT 720.

207
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,127
- NO ONE SAYS THAT.
- I JUST SAID IT.

208
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,530
- MY COMPANY,
ENTERTAINMENT 720,

209
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:12,032
HAS AN AMAZING BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITY FOR KERNSTON'S.

210
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,701
MIND IF I STEAL YOU AWAY
FOR A FEW SECONDS?

211
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:14,968
GIVE YOU THE 'TAILS?

212
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,036
- THE 'TAILS?

213
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,004
- THE DETAILS.

214
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,172
MOST PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY
SAY "THE DEETS."

215
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,574
I SAY "THE 'TAILS."

216
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:23,243
JUST ONE EXAMPLE
OF INNOVATION.

217
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,045
- LOOK, I DON'T LIKE
TO THROW AROUND THE WORD

218
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,114
"BUTTHEAD" TOO OFTEN.

219
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,616
IF YOU CALL EVERYBODY
A BUTTHEAD,

220
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,983
THEN IT KIND OF LOSES
ITS IMPACT.

221
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,019
BUT I CAN SAY
WITHOUT HESITATION

222
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,854
THAT TOM IS BEING
A REAL [bleep].

223
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:37,925
- HEY!
YOU STOLE THE NIPPLE KING.

224
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,192
THANKS A LOT,
TRAITOR.

225
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,028
- I'M SORRY, I JUST NEEDED TO
ASK HIM ABOUT THIS ONE THING,

226
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,062
BUT WE'RE ALL GOOD NOW.

227
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,531
WH-WHAT IF I JUST INTRODUCE YOU
FOR YOUR SPEECH?

228
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,732
- I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

229
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:45,733
WHY DON'T YOU GO OVER
TO ONE OF YOUR RUGS

230
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,768
AND SIT ON YOUR OWN FACE?

231
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,270
I DON'T NEED
YOUR "HELP" ANYMORE.

232
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,772
- HI THERE.

233
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,674
IS THERE A PROJECT
YOU'RE WORKING ON?

234
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,042
- I KNOW MORE THAN YOU.

235
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,645
- ALL RIGHT.

236
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,279
- WHEN APRIL AND ANDY MARRIED,

237
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,148
I DIDN'T GET THEM
A WEDDING PRESENT.

238
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,916
IN MY EXPERIENCE,
WEDDING PRESENTS

239
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,186
ARE NOTHING MORE THAN KINDLING
ON A DIVORCE BONFIRE.

240
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,223
BUT I THINK I FOUND A WAY I CAN
HELP THEM REALLY MAKE A HOME.

241
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,762
YOU, BEANBAG,
COME WITH ME.

242
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:15,896
- I'M AN EGGPLANT.

243
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:17,665
- I DON'T CARE.
COME WITH ME.

244
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:21,068
- WHY?
- I NEED SMALL HANDS.

245
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:25,873
- I'M...SCARED.

246
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,642
- LOOK WHO DECIDED
TO JOIN THE PARTY, BRO!

247
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:30,277
THAT'S AWESOME!

248
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,311
WHERE'S YOUR COSTUME?

249
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,547
HONEY, HE'S WEARING
A COSTUME.

250
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:34,848
HE'S GOING AS LAME.

251
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,149
- [laughs]

252
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,951
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD
COSTUME ACTUALLY.

253
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,087
BUT, UH, I THINK THE BATMAN
COSTUME'S WAY BETTER.

254
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,755
YOU SHOULD GO WEAR THAT.

255
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,056
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA PUT ON A COSTUME

256
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,993
BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY
ATTENDING THIS PARTY...

257
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,260
THAT'S AT MY HOUSE.

258
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,797
- HEY, LISTEN, IF YOU'RE
MAD ABOUT SOMETHING,

259
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,098
YOU SHOULD JUST--
- NO, I'M NOT.

260
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,065
I'M NOT MAD.

261
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,967
- REALLY? LISTEN,
I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE MAD.

262
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,036
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST TALK TO US ABOUT IT.

263
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,907
[in a weird slurred voice]
MY NAME'S BEN.

264
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,175
I'M MAD.

265
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,677
- ALL RIGHT, THAT WAS GREAT,
THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THAT.

266
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:04,845
- SOFT, SOFT LIPS.

267
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,913
- YOUR FINGERS ARE SALTY.

268
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,314
I'M GONNA FINISH MY WORK--

269
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,217
OREN, NO! NO. STAY OUT.

270
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,352
- PAWNEE HAS SUFFERED
THROUGH A TOUGH ECONOMY.

271
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,089
AND WHAT HAS KEPT OUR TOWN ALIVE
IS YOU, THE SMALL BUSINESSMAN.

272
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,759
AND I'M NOT REFERRING
TO YOUR STATURE, GARY.

273
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,194

*

294
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:07,040
- ENTERTAINMENT 720 HAS BEEN
A FIXTURE OF THIS COMMUNITY

295

SINCE JUNE.

296
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,409
- TOM, LISTEN TO ME.

297
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,945
TURN THAT OFF OR
GIVE ME THE REMOTE RIGHT NOW.

298
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,147
- CAN WE LET IT PLAY PLEASE?

299
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,415
- YOU'RE LUCKY THAT
MARTIN KERNSTON IS HERE

300
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,818
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA NEED
ANOTHER NIPPLE.

301

I THINK I GOT IT.

305
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,419
- YEP, YOU GOT IT.

306
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,454
- CAN YOU AT LEAST TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

307
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,089
I'M A HOMEOWNER.

308
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:59,059
I WOULD LIKE
TO ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING.

309
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,394
- YEAH.

310
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:04,197
I'M TIGHTENING THE VALVE STEM

00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,845
A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT
AND PRIDE.

318

THAT'S NEXT.

327
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,230
- I CAN'T REVEAL
MY IDENTITY

328
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,066
BECAUSE OF VARIOUS
CORPORATE ENEMIES,

329
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,267
BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY,

00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,178
NOW COME JOIN ME
AND LET'S ALL TAKE A DIP

348
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:28,548
IN THE E720 MOBILE HOT TUB!

349
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,951
IT'S PARKED RIGHT OUTSIDE.

350
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:34,087
LE'GO.

351
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,991
- HEY, BEN.
- HEY.

352
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,827
- THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T COMING
TO THE PARTY.

353
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,461
- WELL, I'M JUST
HAVING A BUTTERFINGER.

354
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,495
- OH, REALLY?

355
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,864
- IS THAT OKAY?

356
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,365
- NO.

357
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,300
YOU'RE NOT PART OF THE PARTY,
YOU CAN'T HAVE THE CANDY.

358
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,970
BACK UP. BACK UP.
- ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

359
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,105
- I HAVE ONE SISTER.

360
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,273
WE STEAL
EACH OTHER'S STUFF,

361
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,542
HACK EACH OTHER'S
TWITTER ACCOUNTS,

362
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,277
SET EACH OTHER'S
CLOTHES ON FIRE.

363
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,247
THERE ARE NO RULES.

364
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,384
- WE NEED TO DEAL WITH
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU.

365
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,153
- OH, PLEASE,
COME INTO MY ROOM.

366
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,956
- SEE? YOU'RE ANGRY AT ME AND
YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT.

367
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,559
AND I'M GONNA BEAT YOU UP UNTIL
YOU DO, BECAUSE I'M MATURE.

368
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:13,961
- WHAT ARE YOU--

369
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,996
STOP IT.

370
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,430
- I GREW UP WITH FIVE BROTHERS
AND WE FOUGHT.

371
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:21,101
USING THE DWYER METHOD,
WHICH WAS YELLING,

372
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,335
WRESTLING,

373
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,938
CRYING,

374
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,439
FOLLOWED BY
LOTS OF HUGS.

375
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,275
AND THEN MORE WRESTLING,
BUT THE FUN KIND,

376
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,476
AND THEN CRYING WHEN
THE FUN KIND OF WRESTLING

377
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,011
GOT OUT OF HAND.

378
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:33,280
- UM, CAN YOU
LET ME GO?

379
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,948
- NOT 'TIL YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG.

380
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,084
- [sighs]

381
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,551
- UM, MR. PRESIDENT.

382
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:42,155
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE
ACTIONS OF THAT LITTLE WEASEL.

383
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,090
- LESLIE, I'M A FRUGAL MAN.

384
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,325
I DON'T LIKE EXTRAVAGANCE
OR SHOWMANSHIP.

385
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,227
THAT'S WHY I CUT
MY OWN HAIR.

386
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,197
AND IT'S WHAT'S MADE ME
A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN.

387
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,500
SO IF ENTERTAINMENT 720 IS
THE KIND OF BUSINESS YOU TRUST,

388
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,970
I'M AFRAID YOU AND I
DON'T SHARE THE SAME VALUES.

389
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,647
- THERE YOU ARE,
YOU LITTLE BASTARD.

390
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,349
GET OUT OF THERE
RIGHT NOW.

391
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,952
- LESLIE, CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND JUST LET ME SIT HERE?

392
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,254
- TOM, GET OUT OF YOUR STUPID
LIMOUSINE HOT TUB RIGHT NOW,

393
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,522
OR WE ARE NO LONGER FRIENDS.

394
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,057
- I'M NOT GETTING OUT.

395
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,093
- FINE, THEN I'M GETTING IN.

396
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,094
LISTEN TO ME.

397
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,329
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
GET AWAY FROM ME.

398
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,098
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE? YOU'RE
A SELFISH LITTLE PUNK, OKAY?

399
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,233
JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT
SOMETHING DOESN'T MEAN

400
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,434
THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO BOW TO--

401
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,970
LISTEN TO ME! YOU DIDN'T EVEN
LET ME HAVE MY ONE NIGHT.

402
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,205
LOOK AT ME!
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE.

403
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,974
LOOK AT ME.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE!

404
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,142
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT YOUR FACE ALL NIGHT.

405
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,243
GOD!

406
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,345
- I'M SORRY.

407
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,479
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

408
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,149
- MY COMPANY'S BANKRUPT.

409
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:45,518
OKAY? ENTERTAINMENT 720
IS DEAD.

410
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:49,256
- OH, MAN.

411
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:52,960
- [grunts]

412
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,995
- EXCUSE US.

413
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,063
NICE FORM, SON.

414
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,365
MAKE SURE YOU KEEP
A FIRM PRESSURE ON THE CRANIUM.

415
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,466
- ON THE CRANIUM?

416
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:00,700
- LISTEN UP!

417
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,669
I HAVE TO TURN OFF THE POWER
FOR ONE MINUTE.

418
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,605
- WE'RE GONNA GO DARK, PEOPLE.
BEAR WITH US, OKAY?

419
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,640
WE GOTTA SWITCH OFF
THE MAIN FUSE HOSE.

420
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,009
- IT'S JUST A FUSE.

421
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:13,113
- IT'S JUST A FUSE...PEOPLE.
JUST A FUSE.

422
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:18,151
[cheering]

423
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,727
- WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD GET
OUT OF THIS HOT TUB.

424
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,496
- I'M TOO SAD
TO GET OUT.

425
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,730
AND I'M ALL PRUNEY.

426
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,065
- WHAT HAPPENED?

427
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,166
- I DON'T KNOW.

428
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,401
I GUESS I JUST DIDN'T MOISTURIZE
ENOUGH THIS MORNING,

429
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,402
AND I'VE BEEN
LAYING AROUND--

430
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,071
- WITH THE COMPANY, TOM.

431
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,974
- WE'RE HEMORRHAGING CASH
EVER SINCE WE OPENED.

432
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,742
THEY SAY YOU'VE GOT
TO SPEND MONEY TO MAKE MONEY.

433
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,743
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE WENT WRONG.

434
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,478
WE SPENT ALL OF OUR MONEY.

435
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,214
- OKAY.

436
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,616
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

437
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,019
SOME GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
COMFORT FOOD.

438
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,253
- WHERE ARE WE GONNA GET
ALBACORE TUNA

439
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,454
WITH CRISPY ONIONS
AT THIS HOUR?

440
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,688
- COME ON.

441
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,358
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT THE
HANDLE ON THAT TORQUE WRENCH.

442
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,493
- YEAH, WELL, THE FLANGE
WAS A LITTLE WARPED.

443
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,996
SO I JUST GOOSED IT WITH
A TRIPLE THREE BOLT SMACK.

444
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,731
- THAT WAS NONSENSE.

445
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,334
- I KNOW, BUT IT'S SO FUN
TO TALK LIKE THAT.

446
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:08,601
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

447
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:12,239
KEEP THIS.

448
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:13,506
YOU EARNED IT.

449
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,076
- THANKS, RON.

450
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,284
- I NEED TO GET MORE DIP.

451
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,519
- GREAT.

452
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:32,259
- I'M GOING.

453
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,027
COME ON, WALK.
- NO.

454
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,529
THIS IS A PACIFIST PROTEST.
HAD ENOUGH?

455
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,698
YOU NEED TO LET GO OF ME.
[groans]

456
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,134
- YEAH, GET IT. THAT'S GOOD.
THERE WE GO.

457
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,671
[both grunting
and groaning]

458
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:47,340
- LET GO OF ME.
- HE'S GOT HIS BACK.

459
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,508
COME ON, FIGHT ME.

460
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,644
- NO!
- NOOOO.

461
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,281
[gasping]

462
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,648
NICE! YEAH!

463
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,450
- OH, MY GOD, ANDY,
I AM SO SORRY.

464
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,252
- [moans]

465
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,454
PSYCH!
BLOOD CAPSULES.

466
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,455
[laughs]

467
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,591
- WHAT?
- YEAH!

468
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,360
I WANTED TO SHOCK YOU
INTO EXPRESSING YOUR ANGER.

469
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,097
AND THAT WAY--[bleep]!
MY NOSE IS BROKEN.

470
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,131
- OH, MY GOD.

471
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,399
- I GOTTA GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
- ANDY, COME ON.

472
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,400
- OH, MY GOD.
- DIDN'T IT FEEL GOOD?

473
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,401
- COME HERE.

474
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,402
- [laughs]
YUP!

475
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,537
- WOW, I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE DOING GREAT.

476
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,738
I REMEMBER TRYING
TO HIRE YOU ONCE.

477
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,340
AND YOU SAID
YOU WERE ALL BOOKED UP.

478
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,375
- THAT WAS A BUSINESS TACTIC.

479
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,610
FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS, WE TOLD
EVERYONE WE WERE BOOKED SOLID

480
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,212
TO MAKE PEOPLE WANT US MORE.

481
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:28,281
- OH, NO, THAT'S THE STUPIDEST
IDEA I'VE EVER HEARD.

482
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,416
[laughter]

483
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,850
- WELL, HINDSIGHT IS 20/20.

484
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,219
- KIND OF SEEMS
LIKE REGULAR SIGHT

485
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,720
SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT THAT ONE.

486
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,389
ALSO, YOUR LOGO, IT'S THE WORST
LOGO I'VE EVER SEEN.

487
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,191
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
IT'S GIBBERISH.

488
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:42,295
- WE MADE SOME MISTAKES.

489
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,264
TONIGHT WAS MY LAST CHANCE
TO LAND A BIG CLIENT.

490
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,333
AND I FAILED AGAIN.

491
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,700
GOD, IT'S SO EMBARRASSING.

492
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,370
- OH, HEY, TOM,
YOU'RE A SMART GUY.

493
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,472
AND CHARMING.
OCCASIONALLY.

494
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:55,708
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A LOT MORE GOOD IDEAS.

495
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,278
- THANKS.

496
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,147
SORRY I SCREWED UP
YOUR CAMPAIGN THING.

497
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,848
I REALLY WANTED
TO DO A GOOD JOB.

498
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,451
I MADE YOU THIS AMAZING
VIDEO BIOGRAPHY.

499
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,253
- OF MY LIFE?

500
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,387
- IT'S BACK AT THE OFFICE.

501
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,755
- WELL, LET'S EAT AND GO.
- OKAY.

502
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,823
- DIDN'T I ASK FOR
WHIPPED CREAM ON THIS?

503
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:11,891
MA'AM?

504
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,161
- UGH, DOES IT HURT?

505
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,263
- YEAH, YOU BROKE
MY NOSE, SO...

506
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,664
- I'M SORRY.
- BUT I DON'T EVEN CARE.

507
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:20,833
JUST GET IT ALL
OUT THERE, MAN. GO.

508
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,202
- ALL RIGHT...MAYBE YOU HAVE
TO START THINKING ABOUT

509
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,803
HOW--HOW YOUR ACTIONS
AFFECT ME.

510
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:27,840
LIKE, TELL ME ABOUT STUFF
HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE.

511
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:31,344
STOP REFERRING TO MY BEDROOM
AS A COMMON SPACE.

512
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:35,282
STOP USING MY COMFORTER
FOR YOUR PILLOW FORTS.

513
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,283
JUST...RESPECT ME.

514
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,284
- ABSOLUTELY.

515
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,551
- REALLY?
- YEP.

516
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,587
AND IN RETURN, I'LL ONLY ASK
FOR ONE THING,

517
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,922
WHICH IS FOR YOU TO PAY
FOR STUDIO RECORDING TIME

518
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,424
FOR MY BAND TO DO
OUR NEW ALBUM.

519
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,726
IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT 5,600 BUCKS.
DEAL?

520
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,696
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

521
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,264
- HERE'S SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN
AND SOME ICE PACKS.

522
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,366
- OH.
- YOU HIS FRIEND?

523
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,403
- HIM? HELL, NO.

524
00:18:56,436 --> 00:19:00,240
WE'RE BROTHERS.

525
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,941
- EXCUSE ME. HEY.
- HI.

526
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,810
- WE SHOULD GO.
I'M BLOCKING AN AMBULANCE.

527
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,279
EW, IF YOUR NOSE IS
ALL WEIRD AFTER THIS,

528
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,447
I'M TOTALLY GONNA
DIVORCE YOU.

529
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,781
- WHATEVER, I'M GONNA
DIVORCE YOU FIRST

530
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,317
FOR WEARING
MY FAVORITE HOODIE.

531
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,552
- IS EVERYTHING COOL?

532
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:15,722
- YEAH, IT IS.
- LET'S GO.

533
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,357
- WE JUST CAN'T USE
BEN'S COMFORTERS ANYMORE

534
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,525
FOR OUR PILLOW FORTS.

535
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,295
- UGH, WHAT ARE WE
GONNA HAVE SEX ON?

536
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:26,799
- THE YEAR WAS 1975.

537
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,835
IT WAS A TIME OF TROUBLE.

538
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:32,439
WATERGATE,
VIETNAM,

539
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:35,242
PETER GABRIEL
LEAVES GENESIS.

540
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,444
BUT THEN,
A RAY OF HOPE...

541
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,511
[baby crying]

542
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:44,217
LESLIE BARBARA KNOPE
WAS BORN ON MARCH 20, 1975.

543
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:47,287
AND SHE HAS BEEN A LOYAL PATRON
OF ITS BUSINESSES EVER SINCE.

544
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,291
- TOM HAVERFORD IS A SELFISH,
UNCTUOUS, SLEAZY,

545
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,894
SELF-PROMOTING, GOOD-HEARTED,
SECRETLY KIND AND WONDERFUL

546
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,563
TINY LITTLE PERSON.

547
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,298
HE WENT TO
KERNSTON'S OFFICE

548
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,833
AND BASICALLY BEGGED HIM
TO MEET WITH ME AGAIN.

549
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,835
I THINK HE TECHNICALLY
MIGHT HAVE BRIBED HIM.

550
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,437
BUT HEY, YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER WORKS.

551
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,573
IT WAS MARY PICKFORD
WHO ONCE SAID,

552
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:09,776
"THIS THING WE CALL FAILURE
IS NOT THE FALLING DOWN,

553
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:13,246
BUT THE STAYING DOWN."

554
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,947
TOM WON'T BE DOWN FOR LONG.

555
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,750
- HER NAME IS LESLIE KNOPE.

556
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,819
AND I'M GONNA VOTE FOR HER.

557
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:24,391
AND IF L'IL SEBASTIAN WERE STILL
ALIVE, HE'D SURELY VOTE FOR HER.

558
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:28,561
AND I RECKON
YOU SHOULD TOO.

559
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,297
DID YA LIKE IT?

560
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,798
IT'S PRETTY GREAT, RIGHT?

561
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,466
WORKED REALLY HARD ON IT.

562
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,968
- YEAH, I LOVED IT.

563
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,505
I'M GONNA WATCH IT EVERY DAY
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

564
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,508
AND WHEN I DIE, I'M GONNA
PROJECT IT ON MY TOMBSTONE.

565
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,742
[sobs]

566
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,348
- I HAD AN AMAZING TIME
AT THAT PARTY.

567
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,683
AND IN THE CASE OF THE WOMAN
WHO'S STOLEN MY HEART,

568
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:54,421
THE CULPRIT...
WAS MILLICENT GERGICH.

569
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,523
- YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO
ACTUAL DETECTIVE WORK.

570
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:57,924
- I WILL.

571
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,927
AND, JERRY, I'VE DECIDED
TO TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER HOME.

572
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,962
AND WE MAY BE
HAVING INTERCOURSE.

573
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,298
- PLEASE, YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
SAYING THINGS LIKE THAT TO ME.

574
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,366
- YOU'VE GOT IT, MAN.

575
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,567
- BYE, DAD.

576
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,838
EVERYTHING OKAY?

577
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,874
I CAN'T FIND MY CAR KEYS.

578
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:18,911
- SOLVE THIS MYSTERY, GENIUS.
