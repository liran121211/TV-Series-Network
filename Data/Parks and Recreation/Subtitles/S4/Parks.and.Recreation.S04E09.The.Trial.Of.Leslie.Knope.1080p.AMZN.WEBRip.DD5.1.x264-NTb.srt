1
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:03,137
- APRIL!

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:04,272
LISTEN, I WAS TRYING TO BUY

3
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:06,174
THIS HAND-CRAFTED
MAHOGANY WOOD MODEL

4
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:09,077
OF A B-25 MITCHELL
PANCHITO AIRCRAFT.

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,279
- AW, FOR ME?
- DON'T SASS ME.

6
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:13,514
AND I WENT TO THIS WEBSITE,
AND THIS AD POPPED UP

7
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,516
THAT SAID "HEY, RON SWANSON!

8
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,551
CHECK OUT THIS GREAT OFFER."

9
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,487
- WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,522
- MY QUESTION IS,
WHAT THE HELL?

11
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,424
- LIKE, HOW DID THEY KNOW
WHO YOU ARE?

12
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,659
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

13
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:28,262
UM, THERE ARE THESE THINGS
CALLED COOKIES,

14
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:30,498
WHERE, LIKE, IF YOU GO TO A SITE
AND BUY SOMETHING,

15
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,733
IT'LL REMEMBER YOU
AND THEN CREATE ADS

16
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,302
FOR OTHER STUFF
YOU MIGHT WANT TO BUY.

17
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:37,338
- SO IT LEARNS INFORMATION?
ABOUT ME?

18
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,507
THAT SEEMS LIKE AN INVASION
OF PRIVACY.

19
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,209
- DUDE, IF YOU THINK
THAT'S BAD,

20
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:44,245
GO TO GOOGLE EARTH
AND TYPE IN YOUR ADDRESS.

21
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:56,390
[triumphant music]

22
00:00:56,424 --> 00:01:04,665
*

23
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,881
- I AM, OF COURSE, SHOCKED...

24
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,418
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE BEN
USUALLY PREFERS TALL BRUNETTES.

25
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:25,519
- WE'RE VERY SORRY

26
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:28,622
FOR THE POSITION
THIS PUTS YOU IN.

27
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:29,890
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

28
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,425
ARE YOU HUGGING ME,
OR ARE WE FIGHTING?

29
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,426
ARE YOU HUGGING OR FIGHTING?
LET ME KNOW.

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,462
- NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS.

31
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,264
I LOVE BOTH OF YOU.

32
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,499
YOU ARE EXEMPLARY
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES.

33
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,402
- "EXEMPLARY"? THAT'S THE WORD
WE WERE THINKING OF.

34
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,471
- WELL, IT'S TRUE.
- ISN'T IT?

35
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,273
- WHICH MAKES WHAT
I'M ABOUT TO SAY EVEN SADDER.

36
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,707
- THEN DON'T SAY IT.

37
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,276
- I'M LAUNCHING
A FULL INVESTIGATION

38
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,810
INTO THE EXTENT
OF YOUR WRONGDOING.

39
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,446
PLEASE REPORT MONDAY FIRST THING
TO THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS

40
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,883
FOR YOUR ETHICS TRIAL
AND SUBSEQUENT PUNISHMENT.

41
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,455
- I TOLD YOU
WE'D FEEL BETTER.

42
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:04,858
[door opens]
HEY.

43
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,494
IT'S 6:30 IN THE MORNING.

44
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:09,330
YOUR HEARING DOESN'T START
FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS.

45
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,598
- WELL, I WANTED
TO GET HERE EARLY,

46
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,200
YOU KNOW,
GET A FEEL OF THE ROOM.

47
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,468
- SO YOU GOT HERE--
- 3:00 A.M.

48
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,569
I COULDN'T SLEEP ANYWAY.

49
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:18,406
- WELL, I WANTED TO SNEAK IN
BEFORE YOU GOT HERE--

50
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,375
AN ABSURD PIPE DREAM
I NOW REALIZE WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

51
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:22,810
- IS THAT A PRESENT FOR ME?

52
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,545
- YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

53
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,814
- [gasps]
LI'L SEBASTIAN.

54
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,516
- YEAH, I HAD HIM MADE FOR YOU
AT THE TOY STORE.

55
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,385
- AW, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR MAKING MY LIFE SO WONDERFUL.

56
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,254
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- I WAS TALKING TO HIM.

57
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,688
- OF COURSE.
- BUT ALSO TO YOU.

58
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,257
- THANKS.

59
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,525
- I WISH WE COULD GO
THROUGH THIS TOGETHER.

60
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,859
- LOOK, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

61
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,694
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GET
A SLAP ON THE WRIST,

62
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,430
MAYBE A BRIEF SUSPENSION.

63
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:43,597
- THAT'S NOT OKAY.

64
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,266
THAT'S GONNA GO
ON MY PERMANENT RECORD.

65
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,235
I'M NOT THE KIND OF PERSON
THAT HAS A PERMANENT RECORD.

66
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:50,238
FOR ME, A SLAP ON THE WRIST
IS LIKE A KICK TO THE NUTS.

67
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:51,939
- I KNOW IT IS.

68
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,507
- WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU?

69
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,310
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

70
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,845
WELL, LOOK, I'LL BE OUTSIDE
ALL DAY,

71
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,880
RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT WALL.

72
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,417
SO, IF YOU MISS ME,
YOU JUST LOOK AT THIS...

73
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:05,319
WRINKLED, HIDEOUS MONSTER

74
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,388
AND YOU'LL KNOW
I'M SITTING THERE

75
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,990
ROOTING FOR YOU, OKAY?
- OKAY.

76
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,359
- ALL RIGHT.

77
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:12,793
- GO.
- OKAY.

78
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,396
- MARCUS EVERETT LANGLEY
WAS PAWNEE'S GREATEST LAWYER

79
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,864
AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.

80
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,400
HIS NICKNAME
WAS "OLD STONE FACE"

81
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,734
BECAUSE OF HIS STEELY DEMEANOR

82
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,870
AND BECAUSE HE GOT IN
AN ACCIDENT AT THE ROCK QUARRY

83
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,506
AND DYNAMITE BLEW UP HIS FACE.

84
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,541
- LESLIE KNOPE!
GOOD MORNING!

85
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:30,010
IT IS SNOWING OUTSIDE.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

86
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,412
- YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD.

87
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,381
- ACTUALLY,
I'M QUITE MISERABLE.

88
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,383
I ADMIRE AND RESPECT YOU,

89
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,451
AND DRAGGING YOU
THROUGH AN ETHICS TRIAL

90
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:38,786
IS FILLING ME WITH SADNESS.

91
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,356
I HAVE NEVER FELT SO LOW.

92
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,325
- WELL, YOU'RE RADIATING
PURE JOY.

93
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,560
- I WENT TO MY HERBALIST
AND GOT TWO B-12 SHOTS.

94
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,663
AND THEN I ATE AN UNREASONABLE
AMOUNT OF ST. JOHN'S WORT,

95
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,899
AND MY HERBALIST TOOK
THIS WEIRD BEE POLLEN PASTE

96
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,434
RUBBED IT AROUND MY GUMS.

97
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,469
AND NOW MY MOUTH FEELS
LIKE A SPACESHIP.

98
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,471
THIS IS STRESSFUL.

99
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,714
OH, GOD.

100
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,416
IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

101
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,485
- WE ARE HERE TODAY TO DETERMINE
WHETHER LESLIE KNOPE

102
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,421
VIOLATED ANY MUNICIPAL RULES
OR LAWS

103
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:14,988
DUE TO HER ROMANTIC
RELATIONSHIP

104
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,557
WITH HER SUPERIOR BEN WYATT,

105
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,392
WHOSE HEARING
WILL BE HELD TOMORROW.

106
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,694
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE
A STATEMENT AT THIS TIME?

107
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,363
- YES.

108
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,432
I FREELY ADMIT
TO THE RELATIONSHIP,

109
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,933
AND I WILL NOT BE FIGHTING
THE CHARGES

110
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,736
THAT WE VIOLATED CHRIS' RULE.

111
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,373
BUT WE DID NOTHING ELSE WRONG
OR UNETHICAL.

112
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:35,643
IN 1849, SARAH NELSON QUINDLE
EXPOSED HER ELBOW OUTDOORS,

113
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,878
WHICH WAS A CLASS "A" FELONY.

114
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,880
ALTHOUGH SHE FELT
THE LAW UNJUST,

115
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,049
SHE ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT SHE HAD BROKEN IT,

116
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,718
AND SHE NOBLY ACCEPTED
HER PUNISHMENT--

117
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,420
TO BE SET ADRIFT
ON LAKE MICHIGAN

118
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,422
LIKE A HUMAN POPSICLE.

119
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:51,392
LOOK HOW CALM SHE LOOKS.
THAT'S HOW I FEEL--

120
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,726
TOTALLY ZEN.

121
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,462
- MS. KNOPE, ON WHAT DAY

122
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,365
DID YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH BEN WYATT BEGIN?

123
00:04:57,398 --> 00:05:01,702
- LAST MAY, AT YOUR REQUEST,
BEN AND I DROVE TO INDIANAPOLIS

124
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,337
TO BID FOR THE STATE
LITTLE LEAGUE TOURNAMENT.

125
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:05,773
THE NIGHT WE RETURNED
WAS THE FIRST TIME

126
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,576
WE KISSED EACH OTHER
ON EACH OTHER'S MOUTHS.

127
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,444
IT WAS EXCELLENT.

128
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,481
THAT WAS UNNECESSARY TO ADD.
I'M SORRY. I'M NERVOUS.

129
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,615
[clears throat]
- NEXT QUESTION--

130
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,351
DID YOU EVER RECEIVE
SPECIAL TREATMENT

131
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:20,087
AS A RESULT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH BEN WYATT?

132
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,991
- I RECEIVED ADORABLE NICKNAMES
AND AMAZING BACK RUBS.

133
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,593
OH, YOU MEAN PROFESSIONALLY.
NO.

134
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,896
- AND DID YOU BREAK ANY LOCAL,
STATE, OR FEDERAL LAW

135
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,699
IN AN EFFORT TO COVER UP YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH BEN WYATT?

136
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,435
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

137
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,404
- THANK YOU.
MS. KNOPE, THAT IS ALL.

138
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,406
- MR. TRAEGER, THIS SAYS YOU'RE
GONNA BE CALLING 14 WITNESSES.

139
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,807
IS THAT CORRECT?

140
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,008
- UH, YES, SIR.

141
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,009
- 14?
WHY SO MANY?

142
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,545
I'VE ALREADY ADMITTED
THAT I BROKE YOUR RULE.

143
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,814
- IT'S NOT MY RULE, LESLIE.

144
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,683
IT IS AN IMPORTANT RULE
THAT EXISTS IN EVERY GOVERNMENT.

145
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,084
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS

146
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:53,053
BETWEEN SUPERIORS
AND THEIR EMPLOYEES

147
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,456
LEAD TO FRAUD, CORRUPTION,
AND MISUSE OF PUBLIC FUNDS.

148
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:56,890
- AND YOU THINK
I'M GUILTY OF THAT?

149
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,492
- I THINK THAT YOU BEGAN
YOUR RELATIONSHIP

150
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,494
WITH BEN WYATT
EARLIER THAN YOU'RE SAYING.

151
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:02,563
I BELIEVE THAT YOU CERTAINLY
RECEIVED SPECIAL TREATMENT,

152
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,132
AND I THINK THAT YOU MAY EVEN
BE GUILTY OF BRIBERY.

153
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,734
- NONE OF THOSE THINGS
ARE TRUE.

154
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,537
AND I WILL PROVE IT,
MR. TRAEGER.

155
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,472
- OKAY, TEN-MINUTE BREAK
PLEASE.

156
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,806
- HERE YOU GO, BOSS.

157
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,743
- OKAY, GUYS, WE NEED
TO COUNTER EVERY CHARGE

158
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,578
THAT CHRIS HAS LEVELED
AGAINST ME.

159
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,413
ANDY, I NEED EVIDENCE.
- GOT IT!

160
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:21,048
- WAIT! YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT EVIDENCE.

161
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,182
- AH, RIGHT ON. YES.
HIT ME.

162
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,184
- NEXT TO MY DESK IS A PICTURE
OF A FEMALE POLITICIAN--

163
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,753
BELLA ABZUG.

164
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,688
GET THE KEY THAT'S TAPED
TO THE BACK OF THAT PICTURE.

165
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,022
IT OPENS UP
MY BOTTOM DESK DRAWER

166
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,758
IN THERE ARE SOME FILES--
PAY ATTENTION.

167
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,526
WHERE ARE YOU LOOKING?
LOOK HERE, FOCUS HERE.

168
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,794
GET THE FILES IN THE DRAWER,

169
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,162
AND THEN GET ALL THE FILE BOXES
IN THE OFFICE.

170
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,664
- PUT THE FILES IN THE DRAWER.
LET'S GO.

171
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,699
- NO.
- OKAY, I'LL GO WITH HIM.

172
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,200
- THANK YOU.
RON, CHRIS HAS 14 WITNESSES.

173
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,035
I NEED YOU TO TALK
TO ALL THE DEPARTMENT HEADS

174
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,170
AND FIND OUT
WHO'S GONNA TESTIFY.

175
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,539
- I DON'T KNOW THE NAMES
OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENT HEADS.

176
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,641
- I'LL GO WITH HIM. SERIOUSLY?
WITH THE MEN IN THIS OFFICE?

177
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:48,542
- ANN?
- YEAH?

178
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,444
- I NEED YOU TO TEXT ME
EVERY 30 SECONDS

179
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,079
THAT EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OKAY.

180
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,213
- OKAY.
- [sighs]

181
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,582
[cell phone chimes]

182
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,150
[gasps]
THANKS, ANN!

183
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:00,053
I BROKE ONE RULE, AND I WILL
ACCEPT A SLAP ON THE WRIST.

184
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,222
BUT WHEN YOU SIT BACK AND LET
YOUR REPUTATION BE DESTROYED.

185
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:07,094
YOU GO DOWN IN HISTORY
AS A FROZEN WHORE.

186
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,496
I'M FIGHTING.

187
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,232
- HEY. GOT MY COMPUTER.
I'M ALL SET.

188
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,167
- GREAT. YOU'RE UP NEXT.
HOW IS BEN? IS HE SAD?

189
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:15,936
YOU NEED TO CHEER HIM UP, ANN.
- BEN IS FINE.

190
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,671
HE SAYS HE'S SORRY
HE'S NOT IN HERE.

191
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:19,507
HE SAID TO LOOK
AT THE MONSTER.

192
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,174
I'M HOPING YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

193
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,511
- THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND
THAT CHRIS HAS A KILLER WITNESS.

194
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:24,978
- HOW? WHY?
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

195
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,113
THERE'S NO KILLER WITNESS,

196
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,815
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG--

197
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,818
UNLESS SOMEONE'S PLANNING
TO LIE OR SLANDER US.

198
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,521
OKAY, JUST TO BE SAFE, FIND OUT
WHO IT IS AND SILENCE HIM.

199
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,889
- WITH PLEASURE.
- WAIT. LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR.

200
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:40,160
DON'T SILENCE HIM.
JUST MAKE SURE HE CAN'T TALK.

201
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,995
- OKAY, WE'RE BACK.

202
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,497
CLEAR THIS CHAMBER, PLEASE.

203
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,766
- MS. PERKINS,
CHRIS TRAEGER HAS QUESTIONED

204
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,568
WHEN MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH BEN WYATT BEGAN.

205
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,670
I'D LIKE TO DIRECT YOU
TO YOUR INBOX

206
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,540
AND SPECIFICALLY AN EMAIL
ENTITLED "YAY!"

207
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:56,644
THAT'S Y-A AND 18 "Y"s
AND 44 EXCLAMATION POINTS.

208
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:59,647
- YES, IT IS AN EMAIL
FROM YOU.

209
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,081
OH, AND THERE'S AN ATTACHMENT.

210
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,016
- MM.
INTRIGUING.

211
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,653
COULD YOU PLAY
THE ATTACHMENT, PLEASE?

212
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,821
- SURE.
[Leslie clears throat]

213
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,990
IN A WORLD ON THE BRINK

214
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,561
OF FINANCIAL MELTDOWN...

215
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:17,831
IN A TOWN
UNLIKE ANY OTHER...

216
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:22,202
AN ADORABLE MAN
WITH A CUTE FACE

217
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:26,974
AND THE FUTURE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES--

218
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,175
WHAT?--

219
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,744
WENT FROM BEING FRIENDS

220
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:36,817
TO BEING SO MUCH MORE.

221
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,220
ANN! BEN AND I HOOKED UP
LAST NIGHT! AAH!

222
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,155
AND I LEARNED
HOW TO USE iMOVIE.

223
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,225
CALL ME LATER! BYE!

224
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,628
SO WHAT WAS THE DATE
YOU RECEIVED THAT EMAIL?

225
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,664
- UH, MAY 12TH.
- MAY 12TH...

226
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:53,734
THE DAY AFTER WE RETURNED
FROM INDIANAPOLIS.

227
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,170
- MR. HAVERFORD,

228
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,007
WOULD YOU CONSIDER
LESLIE KNOPE A GOOD EMPLOYEE?

229
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,275
- DID TOM FORD TURN AROUND
THE HOUSE OF GUCCI?

230
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,645
- I DO NOT KNOW, BUT I'LL
ASSUME THAT THAT IS A YES.

231
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:05,813
HOW LONG WERE YOU TWO LOVERS?

232
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,147
- EXCUSE ME?
- OH, GOD.

233
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,683
- LAST MARCH, I WITNESSED

234
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:12,152
LESLIE KNOPE
AND TOM HAVERFORD

235
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:15,689
ENGAGED IN A PASSIONATE
YET TENDER KISS.

236
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:18,325
IT SEEMS THAT MS. KNOPE
HAS A PATTERN

237
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,761
OF BECOMING INVOLVED
WITH HER CO-WORKERS.

238
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,996
- TOM, WILL YOU PLEASE TELL
THE COMMITTEE

239
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,598
WHY WE WERE KISSING?

240
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:28,068
- AN ONLINE DATING SITE
RANDOMLY PAIRED US UP.

241
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,303
SO, AS A JOKE,
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY

242
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:33,140
TO PRETEND
YOU AND I WERE DATING.

243
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:36,076
AND THEN YOU KISSED ME
AS A JOKE...

244
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,277
TO SHUT ME UP.

245
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,347
- BUT WE NEVER HAD ANY OTHER
ROMANTIC CONTACT AFTER THAT.

246
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,784
- NO, THAT WOULD BE LIKE DATING
MY OLDER SISTER'S ELDERLY AUNT.

247
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,886
- NO, IT WOULDN'T.

248
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,387
WELL, WE'VE BEEN AT IT
FOR HOURS.

249
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,890
AND I DID HAVE SOME PROBLEM
WITH MY CHARACTER WITNESSES.

250
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,324
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
LESLIE KNOPE'S ON TRIAL.

251
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,193
ETHEL BEAVERS DID IT!

252
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,162
BEAVERS DID IT!
- SIT DOWN.

253
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,665
- I WILL HOLD MYSELF
IN CONTEMPT OF THE COURT!

254
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,332
- IS THIS ABOUT THE LAPTOP?
I DIDN'T MEAN TO STEAL IT.

255
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,034
I TOOK IT HOME, AND I SPACED.
I FORGOT.

256
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,202
I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK.

257
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,072
IT TOTALLY WORKS, BUT I GOT
SPAGHETTI IN THE KEYBOARD.

258
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,008
- WHAT LAPTOP?

259
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,309
- OBJECTION.

260
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,145
- BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
I THINK I'M WINNING.

261
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,748
I'VE REFUTED EVERY ONE
OF CHRIS' CLAIMS SO FAR.

262
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:18,719
- I HAVE HERE A RECEIPT
FROM PAWNEE SUPERSUITES HOTEL.

263
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:22,189
LESLIE KNOPE SUBMITTED
THAT RECEIPT FOR REIMBURSEMENT.

264
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:26,159
TAXPAYERS' MONEY IS NOT MEANT
TO BE SPENT--

265
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:29,296
- DONNA, WILL YOU PLEASE
DESCRIBE WHAT WE WERE WEARING

266
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,198
THE EVENING YOU SAW US?

267
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,001
- UM, KHAKIS
AND BUTTON-DOWN SHIRTS--

268
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,202
YOUR BASIC
WHITE PEOPLE CLOTHES.

269
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,337
- AND WHEN YOU WALKED INTO
THE ROOM, WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE?

270
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,806
DID IT LOOK LIKE ANYTHING
ROMANTIC HAD HAPPENED?

271
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:39,907
- OH, HELL, NO.

272
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,810
I HAVE RUINED MY SHARE
OF HOTEL ROOMS,

273
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:45,078
AND TRUST ME, NOTHING SEXUAL
HAPPENED IN THAT ROOM.

274
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,847
IT KIND OF LOOKED
LIKE AN OFFICE.

275
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,716
- MAYBE BECAUSE
ITWASAN OFFICE.

276
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,351
CITY HALL
WAS BEING FUMIGATED,

277
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,253
AND WE NEED TO PULL
AN ALL-NIGHTER.

278
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,723
THE ONLY THING
THAT WAS RAVAGED

279
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:58,225
WERE THESE
FEDERAL GRANT PROPOSALS

280
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,427
THAT DONNA HAD DROPPED OFF
EARLIER.

281
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,930
I'VE SEEN OVER 200 EPISODES
OF LAW & ORDER,

282
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,765
AND IT'S PAYING OFF BIG-TIME.

283
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:08,435
AND BY THE WAY,
WE GOT THE GRAMPS--

284
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,871
GRANTS.
GOD! OH.

285
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,973
IT WAS GONNA BE
SUCH AN AWESOME MOMENT.

286
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,710
SO, ETHEL, YOU'VE BEEN TO A
MILLION OF THESE ETHICS TRIALS.

287
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,813
- I'D SAY IT'S 50/50.

288
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:23,216
YOU WANT TO PUT MONEY ON IT,
I'LL GIVE YOU 60/40 AGAINST.

289
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,118
- IS IT ETHICAL
FOR A COURT STENOGRAPHER

290
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,419
TO BET ON THE OUTCOME
OF A HEARING?

291
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,021
- YOU TELL ME.

292
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,723
YOU'RE THE ONE ON TRIAL.

293
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:33,761
- RON SWANSON
TO THE STAND, PLEASE.

294
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,096
- MR. SWANSON,
THERE HAS BEEN A QUESTION POSED

295
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,165
ABOUT WHEN MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH BEN WYATT ENDED.

296
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,967
CAN YOU CONFIRM
THAT YOU OWN A CABIN

297
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,102
AT 930--
- AH!

298
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,771
STOP, PLEASE.

299
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,773
I DON'T LIKE TO GIVE OUT
MY ADDRESS TO ANYONE,

300
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,941
MUCH LESS HAVE IT
ON AN OFFICIAL RECORD.

301
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:50,043
- RON, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

302
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,345
DO YOU OWN A CABIN--
- AH!

303
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,882
9301 CEDARCREST DR--
- [imitates buzzer sounding]

304
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,117
- 9301 CEDARCREST DR--
- BEEP!

305
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,485
- I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

306
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,254
- 9301 CEDARCREST DRIVE!

307
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,494
- SHE'S HERE.

308
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:08,862
- WHO'S HERE?

309
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,164
- MY EX-WIFE--TAMMY TWO.

310
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,034
I CAN SMELL THE SULFUR
COMING OFF HER CLOVEN HOOVES.

311
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,136
- GOOD NOSE, RON.
TAMMY SWANSON IS HERE.

312
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,270
SHE'LL BE MY NEXT WITNESS.

313
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,873
- TAMMY TWO IS
YOUR KILLER WITNESS?

314
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,508
PLEASE! YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO BETTER--

315
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,343
ACTUALLY, SHE IS
A TERRIFYING SOCIOPATH

316
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,478
WHO COULD SAY OR DO ANYTHING--

317
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,881
PRETTY GOOD KILLER WITNESS.

318
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,517
- MS. SWANSON, DO YOU,
AS YOU CLAIMED,

319
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,252
HAVE EVIDENCE LINKING

320
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,254
LESLIE KNOPE AND BEN WYATT
TO LAW BREAKING?

321
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,255
- ABSOLUTELY.

322
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,857
I HAVE SEVERAL PHOTOGRAPHS

323
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,525
THAT WILL DEFINITIVELY PROVE--

324
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,193
- MAY I REMIND YOU
THAT YOU ARE UNDER OATH,

325
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,329
AND IF YOU LIE, I WILL FIRE YOU
AND HAVE YOU PROSECUTED.

326
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,530
- NOTHING.

327
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,799
THEY WILL DEFINITIVELY
PROVE NOTHING.

328
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,267
YOU CUT ME OFF.

329
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,169
[chuckles]
I DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE.

330
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,938
OH, CHRIS--SO SILLY.

331
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,272
OKAY, BYE, GUYS.

332
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,107
LESLIE, HAVE FUN
WITH THIS TRIAL.

333
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,509
YAY!

334
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:00,580
- I THINK I'VE PROVEN THAT
THE ONLY RULE BEN AND I BROKE

335
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,850
WAS DATING EACH OTHER.

336
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,252
- AND I AM VERY HAPPY
THAT I HAVE NOT UNCOVERED

337
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,320
ANY ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE
OF UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR.

338
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,189
BUT I-I DO HAVE
ONE LAST WITNESS--

339
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,224
GEORGE WILLIAMS
FROM PUBLIC WORKS.

340
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:15,495
- GEORGE WILLIAMS?
WHO'S--

341
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,297
OH, GEORGE WILLIAMS--

342
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,200
HE'S JUST A MAINTENANCE WORKER,
NASCAR ENTHUSIAST, I BELIEVE.

343
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,902
AND, OH, INTERESTING TIDBIT--

344
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:25,205
I ONCE BRIBED HIM TO KEEP
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BEN QUIET.

345
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,410
- YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU SAW
BEN WYATT AND LESLIE KNOPE

346
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,179
KISSING AT LI'L SEBASTIAN'S
MEMORIAL?

347
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,513
- YEAH!

348
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,383
- CAN YOU IDENTIFY LESLIE KNOPE
IN THIS CHAMBER?

349
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,052
- SHE'S RIGHT THERE.
- RIGHT--

350
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,621
- AND WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THIS INCIDENT?

351
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,856
- WELL, I GOT REAL NERVOUS.

352
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,993
THEY CAME UP TO ME, AND THEY
TOLD ME TO FORGET WHAT I SAW.

353
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:49,029
- WHAT YOU SAW WAS NOT
WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

354
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,231
I HAVE A GIFT CERTIFICATE,
ACTUALLY, FOR YOU.

355
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,900
- OH, MY GOD.

356
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,068
- AND THEN THEY GAVE ME
A $50 GIFT CERTIFICATE

357
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:56,136
TO A SPA AND SAID...

358
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,372
- AND THANK YOU
FOR YOUR DISCRETION.

359
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,141
- AND DID YOU USE IT?
- YEAH.

360
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,542
I GOT A FACIAL.

361
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,112
MY WIFE SAID MY SKIN
WAS LUMINOUS.

362
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,179
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

363
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:07,881
NOW, IN ORDER TO COVER UP
THEIR ILLICIT AFFAIR,

364
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:11,218
BEN WYATT AND LESLIE KNOPE
BRIBED A CITY EMPLOYEE.

365
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,053
- GEORGE, I NOTICE
THAT YOU'RE WEARING GLASSES,

366
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,122
YET ON THE DAY IN QUESTION,

367
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,924
I DON'T RECALL YOU
WEARING GLASSES.

368
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:19,292
COULD IT BE BECAUSE
YOU WEREN'T WEARING GLASSES?

369
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,660
- I NEVER WEAR 'EM
ON THE JOB.

370
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,963
- CAN YOU TAKE
YOUR GLASSES OFF, PLEASE,

371
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,464
AND READ THIS FOR US?

372
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:27,434
- "I COULD READ THIS
IF I WEREN'T SO BLIND."

373
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,169
- WELL, THAT WENT TERRIBLY.

374
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,638
I NEED TO CHECK
SOME FACTS AND FIGURES.

375
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,406
I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST
A 55-DAY RECESS.

376
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,175
- YOU CAN HAVE 30 MINUTES,

377
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,946
BUT WE'RE NEARING
THE END HERE, MS. KNOPE.

378
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,481
- OKAY, GUYS, MY ONLY HOPE IS
THAT IN ONE OF THESE OLD BOOKS,

379
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,216
THERE'S SOME WEIRD, ARCANE
STATUTE OR GOVERNMENT RULE

380
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,551
THAT HELPS ME.

381
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:48,088
SO EVERYBODY GRAB A VOLUME,
AND LET'S JUST READ UP.

382
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,357
- OKAY, MINE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY PICTURES.

383
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,461
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANYTHING?
DID ANYBODY FIND ANYTHING GOOD?

384
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:58,365
- IN 1856, THE CITY COUNCIL
BANNED ALL SEXUAL POSITIONS

385
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,367
EXCEPT FOR MISSIONARY.

386
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,036
AND TWO YEARS LATER,
THEY BANNED MISSIONARY.

387
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,538
- 1882, SHOULD A PRESBYTERIAN
SPEAK OUT OF TURN,

388
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,307
HE MAY BE CANED
ACROSS THE SHINBONE.

389
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,675
- OH, MY GOD.

390
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,344
BLACK PEOPLE STILL CAN'T LEGALLY
USE CITY SIDEWALKS.

391
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,580
- LOOK, I KNOW WE'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE SEEN TOGETHER,

392
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,448
BUT I THINK BEN COULD BE
REALLY HELPFUL WITH THIS.

393
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:18,085
CAN SOMEBODY GO GET HIM?
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO.

394
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:21,021
- "ANY WOMAN CAUGHT LAUGHING
IS A WITCH."

395
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,990
THAT'S TRUE.

396
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,191
- UM, HE'S NOT THERE.

397
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,960
- NO, HE SAID HE'D JUST BE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT WALL.

398
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:29,296
HE'S PROBABLY IN THE BATHROOM.
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL FIND HIM.

399
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,607
- THIS MURAL IS CALLED
BAD PAWNEE, GOOD PAWNEE.

400
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,142
ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS
THAT HAVE HAPPENED

401
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,377
IN THIS TOWN'S HISTORY
ARE ON ONE SIDE.

402
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,679
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE
ARE ALL THE GOOD THINGS

403
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,248
THAT HAVE HAPPENED.

404
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,083
I'M ON THE BAD SIDE.

405
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,152
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
- YES, I AM, RON.

406
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,187
I'M GUILTY.
I DID SOMETHING BAD.

407
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:56,723
I'M A BAD PERSON.

408
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,392
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

409
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,729
YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES
A GOOD PERSON GOOD?

410
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,098
WHEN A GOOD PERSON
DOES SOMETHING BAD,

411
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,100
THEY OWN UP TO IT.

412
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:11,171
THEY TRY TO LEARN SOMETHING
FROM IT, AND THEY MOVE ON.

413
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,375
- GUYS,
EVERYBODY STOP READING--

414
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,277
NO MORE LOOPHOLES,
NO MORE FIGHTING.

415
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,445
- ARE YOU SURE, BOSS?

416
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,213
- YEAH.
I KNOW I LET YOU DOWN.

417
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,315
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY
I'M REALLY SORRY.

418
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,084
- LESLIE, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

419
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,352
- YEAH, THIS MAKES ME
LIKE YOU MORE.

420
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,654
- BRIBING SOMEONE TO HIDE
A SEXCAPADE--

421
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,022
I'M PROUD
TO CALL YOU A FRIEND.

422
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,690
- AND I ALWAYS LIKED YOU.

423
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,759
- OKAY, WE'RE BACK.

424
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,462
CLEAR THE CHAMBER, PLEASE.

425
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,366
- I THINK I'M ABOUT
TO GET FIRED, RON.

426
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,335
- MS. KNOPE, UNLESS YOU HAVE
ANY OBJECTIONS,

427
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,071
WE'LL BE ENDING
THIS INVESTIGATION

428
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,739
AND MOVING ON
TO THE PUNISHMENT PHASE.

429
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,109
- I HAVE NO OBJECTIONS.

430
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:52,079
- WE HEREBY HAND DOWN
THE FOLLOWING JUDGMENT.

431
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:55,048
YOU WILL BE SUSPENDED
FOR TWO WEEKS WITH PAY.

432
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,817
- JUST TWO WEEKS?
- CORRECT.

433
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,520
THIS CONCLUDES
THE INVESTIGATION.

434
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,092
- I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA GET FIRED.

435
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,194
I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN FIRED.
WHY DIDN'T I GET FIRED?

436
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:11,231
- BEN ASKED FOR A PRIVATE
MEETING WITH THE COMMITTEE,

437
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:14,401
AND HE TOOK FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE BRIBE

438
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,569
AND RESIGNED,
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

439
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,105
- WHAT?
WAIT. HANG ON.

440
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,739
YOU CAN'T LET HIM RESIGN.

441
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,574
- I TRIED TO TALK HIM
OUT OF IT, BUT...

442
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,711
HIS MIND WAS MADE UP.

443
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,846
LOOK, MY JOB IS TO PROTECT
THE GOVERNMENT

444
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,849
FROM FRAUD AND CORRUPTION.

445
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,185
I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB.

446
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,587
I HOPE THAT
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

447
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,089
- I DO.

448
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,424
HONESTLY, I DO.

449
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,426
- 'CAUSE YOUR ACTIONS
WOUNDED ME TO MY CORE,

450
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,628
WHICH IS NOT EASY
SINCE THE BULK OF MY WORKOUTS

451
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,564
ARE FOCUSED
ON CORE STRENGTHENING.

452
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,400
BUT WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS.
YOU ARE...

453
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,269
AN EXCELLENT
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE.

454
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,870
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,

455
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,106
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
I'VE EVER MET WHO'S WORTHY

456
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,575
OF BEING BEN'S GIRLFRIEND.

457
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,310
- I HOPE THAT'S TRUE.

458
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,849
- YOU KNOW, THE MEETING
THAT BEN AND I HAD--

459
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,751
IT'S ON THE RECORD.

460
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,154
YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK
AT THE LAST PAGE

461
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,222
OF THE TRANSCRIPT.

462
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,860
- "MR. WYATT:
CHRIS, FOR GOD'S SAKE,

463
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,296
"WOULD YOU MIND NOT JUMPING
FOR A WHILE?

464
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,131
MR. TRAEGER:
SORRY, BEN, BUT"...

465
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,533
- THIS IS HOW
I FIGHT DEPRESSION.

466
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,801
OKAY, FINE.
I'LL STOP.

467
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,436
- THANK YOU.

468
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,406
- OKAY, SO YOU ARE PREPARED

469
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,209
TO RESIGN,
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY,

470
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,179
AND TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ALL THE EVENTS

471
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,681
THAT TRANSPIRED
AT LI'L SEBASTIAN'S MEMORIAL.

472
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,916
- "MR. WYATT: THAT IS CORRECT. "
- THAT IS CORRECT.

473
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,585
- "MR. TRAEGER:
OKAY, FINE.

474
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,920
"THIS MAKES ME SADDER
THAN I PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT

475
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,856
"HUMANLY POSSIBLE,
BUT I ACCEPT YOUR RESIGNATION.

476
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,359
CAN I ASK YOU
ONE MORE QUESTION?"

477
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,862
- WAS ALL OF THIS--
ALL THE SNEAKING AROUND,

478
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,864
THE SCANDAL,
LOSING YOUR JOB--

479
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,933
WAS IT WORTH IT?

480
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,868
- YES.

481
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,637
IT WAS.

482
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,906
- "BECAUSE I LOVE LESLIE.
I WANT TO BE WITH HER.

483
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,408
"AND I DON'T WANT TO HIDE

00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,810
"THE WAY I FEEL
ABOUT HER ANYMORE.

485
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,345
"SO, YEAH, IT WAS WORTH IT,

486
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,647
"BECAUSE I'M IN LOVE
WITH LESLIE KNOPE.

487
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,816
"MR. TRAEGER:
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:22,161
- [sobbing]
- OH.

493
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,733
LET IT OUT, I GUESS.

494
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,335
- "END TRANSCRIPT."

495
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,441
[car door opens, closes]

496
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,875
- HI, HONEY,
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

497
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,878
- OH, I'VE HAD BETTER.

498
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,580
HOW ABOUT YOU?

499
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,915
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT FOR ME.

500
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,517
- WELL, I WAS PRETTY SURE

501
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,819
IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

502
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,821
I HOPE IT DOESN'T AFFECT
YOUR CAMPAIGN.

503
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,790
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT

YOU CAN'T EVEN GET
YOUR OWN NAME RIGHT.

522
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,783
- ACTUALLY,
MY REAL NAME IS GARY.

523

- GARY?

524
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,453
- ON MY FIRST DAY HERE,
THE OLD DIRECTOR--

525
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,687
HE CALLED ME JERRY,

526
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,589
AND I JUST DIDN'T THINK
I SHOULD CORRECT HIM.

527
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,525
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOUR NAME IS JERRY.

528
00:20:58,558 --> 00:20:59,592

529
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,728

GARY GERGICH.
JERRY GERGICH.

533
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,702
GARY GERGICH. JERRY--
GOD, THEY'RE BOTH HORRIBLE.

534
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:12,772
BUT JERRY'S BETTER.
I'M GONNA CALL YOU JERRY.

535
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:17,477
OKAY, JERRY, DO YOU REMEMBER
A TIME...

536
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,780
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T GET
OVER THE GARY/JERRY THING.

537
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:21,914
- NEITHER CAN I.
JERRY, YOU CAN GO.

538
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,450
WE NEED A FIVE-MINUTE BREAK.
