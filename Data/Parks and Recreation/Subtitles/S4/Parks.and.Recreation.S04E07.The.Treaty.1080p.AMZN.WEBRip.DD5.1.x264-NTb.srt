1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:02,570
- OH, HEY, BEN.

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,372
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY COMPLETE COLLECTION

3
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:06,774
OF ALL 193 NATIONAL FLAGS?

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:09,510
OH, HERE THEY ARE.

5
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,445
- WOW!
- SO I'VE BEEN ASKED TO RUN

6
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:15,249
THIS YEAR'S MODEL U.N.
AT PAWNEE CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL.

7
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:16,584
ATTENDANCE HAS BEEN LOW,

8
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,487
AND IF I DON'T MAKE IT AWESOME,
THEY MAY CANCEL IT.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,291
I WONDER IF I'M GONNA
MAKE IT AWESOME.

10
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:26,094
OR I COULD BE SOUTH KOREA.
YOU COULD BE BANGLADESH.

11
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,429
WE COULD FORM LIKE
A TRANS-ASIATIC ALLIANCE.

12
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,364
- I LIKE IT.
AND I SEE THE MERITS OF IT.

13
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:31,565
I JUST WORRY
IF WE'RE BOTH IN ASIA,

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,235
IT MIGHT LIMIT OUR SCOPE.
- MM.

15
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,569
- I KINDA WANT TO ROLL UP
MY SLEEVES

16
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:38,239
AND MAKE GEOPOLITICAL
PROBLEM-SOLVING MY BITCH.

17
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,773
- AMEN, BROTHER.

18
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:41,842
LET'S GO BACK TO PLAN "A."
I'LL BE DENMARK, YOU BE PERU.

19
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,311
- YES!

20
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:44,512
OH, I DIDN'T REALLY DO

21
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,448
MODEL UNITED NATIONS
IN HIGH SCHOOL, SO...

22
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,850
OH, WAIT.
I SUPER-DID.

23
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,785
- I NEED A FEW MORE
VOLUNTEERS.

24
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:53,154
ANDY, WILL YOU BE ICELAND?

25
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,855
- THE BAD GUYS
FROM MIGHTY DUCKS 2?

26
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,257
DON'T THINK SO.
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT JAPAN?

27
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,259
- THE BAD GUYS
FROM KARATE KID 2?

28
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,861
EVEN WORSE.
HOW 'BOUT GERMANY?

29
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,396
THEY'VE NEVER BEEN
THE BAD GUYS.

30
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,831
- WHY DON'T YOU BE FINLAND?

31
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,133
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

32
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,767
- AND I'LL BE THE MOON.

33
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,137
- NO, YOU'RE GONNA BE
SOUTH AFRICA OR...

34
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,571
PAKISTAN.
- I'M THE MOON, OR I QUIT.

35
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,107
- APRIL.
- MOON OR QUIT, MAN.

36
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:14,375
- FINE. YOU BE SOUTH AFRICA,

37
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,144
AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO SECRETLY
RUN THE MOON.

38
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,279
- THE MOON ACCEPTS
YOUR RIDICULOUS PROPOSAL.

39
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,480
- RON! YOU WANNA JOIN US?

40
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,215
LOOK!
I'LL LET YOU BE AMERICA.

41
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:23,117
- [snickers]

42
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:25,286
AND TEACH KIDS
THAT NOT ONLY IS GOVERNMENT GOOD

43
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,389
BUT THAT THERE SHOULD BE
A WORLD-WIDE SUPER-GOVERNMENT?

44
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,858
I'D RATHER SAND DOWN
MY TOENAILS.

45
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,794
EVERY THREE WEEKS,
I HAVE TO SAND DOWN MY TOENAILS.

46
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,330
THEY'RE TOO STRONG
FOR CLIPPERS.

47
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:39,333
[triumphant music]

48
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:47,541
*

49
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:58,319
- EXCUSE ME.

50
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,854
ARE YOU LESLIE KNOPE?
OH, WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

51
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:04,192
OF COURSE YOU ARE.
- BONJOUR, MADAME AMBASSADEUR.

52
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,893
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING

53
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,229
AND TRYING TO HELP SAVE
OUR CLUB.

54
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:09,430
WE'RE SO EXCITED TO SEE

55
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,532
A TRUE PAWNEE MODEL U.N. LEGEND
IN ACTION.

56
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:12,866
- THANK YOU. I REALLY WOULDN'T
DESCRIBE MYSELF

57
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,169
AS A MODEL U.N. LEGEND.

58
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:17,805
I'D GO WITH ICON.
OR HERO.

59
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,908
- LOOK, IF YOU ASK ME,
ENRON IS DOWN BUT NOT OUT.

60
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,211
WHO DOESN'T LIKE
A COMEBACK STORY?

61
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,779
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANNA HEAR
MY PLAN, GET AT ME LATER.

62
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,348
I GOTTA MEET UP
WITH AN OLD FRIEND.

63
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,516
ALL RIGHT, PEACE, MAN.

64
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,418
LET'S GO DO THIS LUNCH THING.

65
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,386
- I JUST HAVE ONE MORE
QUICK INTERVIEW.

66
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,922
I'M STILL TRYING TO FIND
YOUR REPLACEMENT.

67
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,958
THAT IS, UNLESS YOU WANT
YOUR OLD JOB BACK.

68
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,261
- I TOLD YOU BEFORE, RONSEPH,
I MOVED ON TO BIGGER THINGS.

69
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:43,297
E720 GOING UNDER
WAS A BLESSING.

70
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,399
I'M TEARING IT UP
ALL OVER TOWN LIKE A BOSS.

71
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:47,368
- SOUNDS GREAT, TOMMY.

72
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:50,238
I'VE OFFERED TOM HIS JOB BACK
SEVERAL TIMES,

73
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,273
AND EACH TIME HE'S TOLD ME
HE'S JUST TOO BUSY

74
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,941
BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR.

75
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:54,942
THEN TWO DAYS AGO,

76
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:58,379
I SAW HIM SPRAYING COLOGNE
SAMPLES AT MACY'S.

77
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,981
THE YOUNG MAN
HAS A LOT OF PRIDE.

78
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,284
THIS ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.

79
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,518
- ANN PERKINS.

80
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,420
- HEY, CHRIS, HOW'S IT GOING?
- NOT GOOD.

81
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:07,855
CAN I TALK TO YOU?
- OKAY.

82
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,223
- I'M NOT SURE
IF YOU'RE AWARE,

83
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,258
BUT I AM ROMANTICALLY
INVOLVED

84
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,893
WITH JERRY GERGICH'S
SURPRISINGLY HOT DAUGHTER

85
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:13,794
MILLICENT GERGICH.
- YEAH.

86
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,429
YOU WERE GRINDING WITH HER
PRETTY HARD

87
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:16,897
AT APRIL'S
HALLOWEEN PARTY.

88
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,400
- THAT'S CORRECT. ANYWAY,
WE'VE BEEN ON FOUR DATES,

89
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,968
BUT NOW MILLICENT GERGICH

90
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,503
HASN'T RETURNED
MY LAST TWO PHONE CALLS.

91
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,572
I THINK THE RELATIONSHIP
MAY BE IN TROUBLE,

92
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,407
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

93
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,276
- WOW. A FOUR-DATE-LONG
RELATIONSHIP

94
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:29,443
MIGHT NOT BE 100% PERFECT?

95
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:32,513
I THINK YOU SHOULD LAUNCH
A FULL-SCALE INVESTIGATION.

96
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,616
- THE ROOT OF SARCASM
IS TRUTH, ANN.

97
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,486
I AM GOING TO LAUNCH
A FULL-SCALE INVESTIGATION.

98
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,988
AND I SINCERELY THANK YOU
FOR THAT SUGGESTION.

99
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,924
- GLAD I COULD HELP
IN THESE TRYING TIMES.

100
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,826
- [laughs]
SARCASM AGAIN!

101
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,596
YOU'RE A DELIGHT.

102
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,931
- YOU'VE ALL BEEN
PREPARING FOR MONTHS

103
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,866
FOR THIS YEAR'S
GEOPOLITICAL SCENARIO--

104
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,835
GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS.

105
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:58,406
SECURITY COUNCIL,
WE NEED YOU TO LEAD US,

106
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,941
OR BILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WILL STARVE TO DEATH.

107
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,044
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
HAVE FUN.

108
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,613
DUE TO MY CAMPAIGN,

109
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,416
THE ROMANTIC ASPECT
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP IS OVER.

110
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,850
AND I'M TOTALLY FINE
WITH THAT.

111
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,819
BUT BEN AND I HAVE SO MUCH
IN COMMON.

112
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,321
I MEAN,
WE'RE AMAZING FRIENDS.

113
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:14,555
AND FRIENDSHIP IS BETTER

114
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,457
BECAUSE FRIENDS HELP YOU MOVE.

115
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,892
THEY DRIVE YOU TO THE AIRPORT.

116
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:22,596
BOYFRIENDS JUST...
LOVE YOU AND MARRY YOU.

117
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,967
- JERRY! I AM LAUNCHING
A FULL-SCALE INVESTIGATION

118
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,569
INTO MY ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER

119
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,937
MILLICENT GERGICH,

120
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,805
AND I THOUGHT I COULD PICK
YOUR BRAIN.

121
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,341
- AW, JEEZ, I REALLY SHOULDN'T
BE INVOLVED IN SOMETH--

122
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,543
- QUICK RECAP--
THINGS WERE GOING WONDERFULLY.

123
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,478
WE CLICKED
ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL.

124
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,847
AND THEN SUDDENLY,
I JUST STOPPED HEARING FROM HER.

125
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,616
NOW, YOU MUST KNOW HER
PRETTY WELL--WHAT GIVES?

126
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,917
- HERE'S WHAT I SAW GO DOWN.

127
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,419
- DONNA! YEAH!
GET IN ON THIS.

128
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,820
- YOU'RE TOO ACCESSIBLE.

129
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,589
EVERY TIME SHE CALLS,
YOU ANSWER.

130
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,558
YOU GOTTA DANGLE THE CARROT,

131
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,025
LITERALLY
AND METAPHORICALLY.

132
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,627
- THANK YOU, DONNA!
- THANKS, DONNA.

133
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:56,397
- SO...COURTNEY.

134
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,566
THIS SAYS YOU RETIRED
IN 1968.

135
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,000
- NO, NO, NO.

136
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:04,004
I WAS FIRED BECAUSE I MADE
A PASS AT AN ETHNIC WOMAN.

137
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,408
- AND WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
FOR THE LAST 43 YEARS?

138
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,377
- OH, YOU KNOW,
HITCHHIKING AROUND.

139
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,413
I WENT TO MEXICO.
I MET A LOT OF ETHNIC GIRLS.

140
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,515
THEY GROW ON TREES
DOWN THERE.

141
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,083
I WAS IN JAIL FOR A SPELL...

142
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,886
THAT ABOUT
BRINGS IT UP TO DATE.

143
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,120
- SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE YOU'RE READY

144
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,989
TO GET BACK IN THE GAME,
COURTNEY.

145
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,024
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

146
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,495
ANOTHER VERY STRONG
CANDIDATE.

147
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,896
- ARE YOU INSANE?

148
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,431
HE WAS A MILLION-YEAR-OLD
RACIST!

149
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:33,066
- HE SAID HE LIKED
ETHNIC GIRLS, TOM.

150
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,868
- I'M SORRY, RON,
BUT I CREATED A LEGACY HERE,

151
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,103
AND I NEED TO MAKE SURE
IT'S PROTECTED.

152
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,905
LET'S BRING IN
SOME MORE PEOPLE.

153
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:38,939
IN MY FOUR YEARS HERE,

154
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,575
I REVOLUTIONIZED THE POSITION
OF ADMINISTRATOR

155
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,010
AND MADE THIS PLACE COOL.

156
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,545
I WAS THE FIRST PERSON

157
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:45,979
TO ABBREVIATE
PARKS AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT.

158
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,481
FIRST IT WAS
PARKS AND RECREATION.

159
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:48,649
THEN PARKS AND REC.

160
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,083
THEN P AND R.

161
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,085
THEN LENGTHENED IT
JUST A LITTLE BIT TO...

162
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,054
[snaps]
TOMMY'S PLACE.

163
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,089
- OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.
I THINK I HAVE IT.

164
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,625
WHAT IF WE DROPPED
INTEREST RATES.

165
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:58,959
WOULD THAT HELP YOU?
- MAYBE.

166
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,828
BUT WHAT IF BRAZIL
AND ARGENTINA

167
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,896
USE THEIR OIL DEPOSITS
AS COLLATERAL?

168
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,532
- OH, THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

169
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,999
- UNDER-EXAGGERATE MUCH,
FRANCE?

170
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,100
- HA HA!

171
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,902
NICE!

172
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,003
[firing sounds]

173
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,038
- HEY, LESLIE, YOU READY?

174
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,039
- [slap] OH!
- OW.

175
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,073
- SORRY.
- THAT'S OKAY.

176
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,207
- HI, WILLIAM.
- HI. YOU READY?

177
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:17,911
- YES. ABSOLUTELY. UM...THEY
WANT ME TO DO A PHOTO OP

178
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,580
FOR THE CAMPAIGN

179
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,482
SO I CAN BOLSTER
MY EDUCATION CREDENTIALS.

180
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,584
CAN WE JUST PRESS PAUSE HERE?
- HOW LONG IS IT GONNA TAKE?

181
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,852
- I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

182
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,920
CAN YOU JUST TREAD WATER
UNTIL I'M READY?

183
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,121
- OH, SURE, YEAH.

184
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,557
I'LL JUST TREAD WATER
UNTIL YOU'RE READY.

185
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,091
- THANKS, BUDDY.

186
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,192
- LESLIE AND I
AREN'T DATING ANYMORE,

187
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,827
BUT, UH, WE'RE FRIENDS.

188
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,829
SO IT'S FUN.
IT'S JUST FUN.

189
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:39,467
IT'S FUN--
IT'S...FUN...

190
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,435
IT IS FUN.

191
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:43,136
- THANKS A LOT.

192
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,171
YES!

193
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:48,442
HONEY! I JUST TRADED FINLAND'S
MILITARY TO KENYA

194
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,844
FOR 50 LIONS.

195
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,580
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT?

196
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,448
- YEAH...
- OKAY.

197
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:56,850
- BUT ALSO MILITARIES
ARE PRETTY GOOD

198
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,452
AT PROTECTING COUNTRIES.

199
00:06:58,486 --> 00:06:59,987
- BUT SO ARE LIONS.

200
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,855
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PAY THEM.

201
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:02,890
THESE KIDS ARE IDIOTS.

202
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,892
I'VE JUST TRADED
ALL OF FINLAND'S BORING STUFF

203
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,660
FOR EVERY OTHER COUNTRY'S
LIONS?

204
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,962
I DEFINITELY HAVE MORE LIONS

205
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,031
THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY
IN THE WHOLE WORLD RIGHT NOW.

206
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,132
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON.

207
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,502
BUT IF THAT ENDS UP
MEANING SOMETHING IN THIS GAME,

208
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,570
I'D SAY I'M SET.

209
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:19,239
[camera lens clicking]

210
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,874
- HEY, SO RUSSIA AND CHINA

211
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,175
ARE ABOUT TO PROPOSE
THEIR OWN PLAN,

212
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,011
SO THE KIDS KINDA WANT
TO GET OURS OUT THERE.

213
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,880
- OH, OKAY--THIS SHOULD PROBABLY
ONLY TAKE FIVE MORE MINUTES.

214
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,482
- LET'S SAY 10 OR 15
TO BE SAFE.

215
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:30,150
- WELL, HOW ABOUT
ME MAKE IT A COOL 40?

216
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,985
- I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST IMPORTANT.

217
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,254
- WELL, THIS IS IMPORTANT TOO.
IT'S KINDA WHY WE CAME HERE.

218
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,256
- I'M SORRY, COULD YOU...
JUST STEP OVER HERE?

219
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,959
YOU'RE IN THE SHOT.
- OH, OF COURSE.

220
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,861
- HER LIFE IS SO AWESOME.

221
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,896
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE FRIENDS
WITH HER.

222
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,032
- SHUT UP, BULGARIA!

223
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,570
- I KNOW, WELL, THAT'S THE GREAT
THING ABOUT TREATIES--

224
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,938
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.
- HEY! I'M BACK.

225
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,172
OR, AS THEY SAY IN DENMARK--
"I'M BACK."

226
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,240
MOST PEOPLE SPEAK ENGLISH.

227
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,275
SO ARE YOU GUYS READY
TO POLISH OFF THIS TREATY?

228
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,245
- OH, UH...ACTUALLY,
I MERGED OUR TREATY

229
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,248
WITH RUSSIA
AND CHINA'S TREATY.

230
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,250
- I GOT CUT OUT
OF MY OWN TREATY?

231
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,018
- YEAH. I GOT SICK
OF TREADING WATER,

232
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:08,856
SO I SWAM OVER TO ASIA,
MADE A DEAL.

233
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,959
- THE NATION OF DENMARK
WOULD LIKE TO FORMERLY REQUEST

234
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,994
A SUMMIT
WITH THE NATION OF PERU

235
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,295
OVER THERE
BY THE REFRESHMENT TABLE.

236
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,866
BECAUSE THE NATION OF DENMARK
NEEDS A JUICE BOX.

237
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,001
I AM SHOCKED AN APPALLED
BY THE ACTIONS

238
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,070
OF THE HONORABLE DELEGATE
FROM PERU.

239
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,072
- LESLIE, JUST--

240
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,040
LOOK...

241
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,976
I THOUGHT I COULD HANDLE
BEING FRIENDS WITH YOU.

242
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,211
BUT I CAN'T, OKAY?

243
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,613
NOW, WE AGREED THE OTHER NIGHT

244
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,883
THAT WE CAN'T SPEND TIME
TOGETHER.

245
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,585
I THINK THAT WAS
THE RIGHT CALL.

246
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,952
- BUT THAT WAS IN
A ROMANTIC WAY.

247
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,121
WE CAN STILL SPEND TIME
TOGETHER AS FRIENDS.

248
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,222
- IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

249
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,858
YOU CAN'T JUST CHOP UP
THE ASPECTS OF A RELATIONSHIP

250
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,059
INTO DISCRETE PARTS

251
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,596
AND SELECT THE ONES YOU WANT
LIKE A BUFFET.

252
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:51,932
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE IT'S SELFISH.

253
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,267
STOP BEING OBTUSE.

254
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,303
- LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
WHERE HE'S COMING FROM.

255
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,338
BUT I HAVE BEEN NOTHING
BUT STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH HIM,

256
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,674
AND IF ANYONE
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD

257
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,143
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULT
POSITION I'M IN, IT'S...

258
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:06,013
IT'S JUST I'VE MADE AN EFFORT

259
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,981
AND I'VE SHARED
MY FLAGS WITH HIM,

260
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:09,883
AND SUDDENLY,
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS?

261
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,051
YOU KNOW WHAT?

262
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,953
THAT LEAVES ME
WITH ONLY ONE OPTION.

263
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,688
JUST EXCUSE ME FOR A--

264
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,592
ATTENTION.
THIS IS AN URGENT WORLD MATTER.

265
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,260
DUE TO A RECENT BETRAYAL,
MY HOMELAND,

266
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,995
THE GREAT STATE OF DENMARK,

267
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,865
HAS OFFICIALLY DECIDED
TO DECLARE WAR ON PERU.

268
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,101
SCANDINAVIAN BROTHERS,
ON MY SIGNAL.

269
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,037
UNLEASH HELL!

270
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,108
- SEE, I JUST DON'T BELIEVE
IN THIS WHOLE

271
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,144
DON'T LET PEOPLE KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL NONSENSE.

272
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,112
I LOVE TELLING PEOPLE
HOW I FEEL.

273
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,280
MOSTLY BECAUSE
I LOVE MOST PEOPLE.

274
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,982
AND I LOVE TELLING THEM
THAT I LOVE THEM.

275
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,316
- YOU DIDN'T TELL THAT GIRL
YOU LOVE HER, DID YOU?

276
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,352
- NO. I'M NOT CRAZY.
- WHAT IS THIS URGENT MEETING

277
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,020
WITH DONNA AND JERRY?

278
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,889
- ANN PERKINS.
I TOOK YOUR ADVICE.

279
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,624
- MY SARCASTIC ADVICE.
- PRECISELY.

280
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,059
AND WE'RE GETTING
TO THE BOTTOM

281
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,126
OF WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH ME AND JERRY'S DAUGHTER,

282
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,028
AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE
A TREMENDOUS ADDITION

283
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,664
TO THIS THINK TANK.

284
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,165
- THIS IS INCREDIBLY
INAPPROPRIATE.

285
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,233
- OH, THANK YOU!
- OKAY, I'M GAME.

286
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,236
- NO. I'M NOT KIDDING.

287
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,205
MY NAME'S GARY,
AND I'M FROM GARY, INDIANA.

288
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,874
- AMAZING.

289
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,075
- PEOPLE LIKE HEARING THAT.

290
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,677
IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF MY
STRONGER ANECDOTES.

291
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,680
- A FACT IS NOT
AN ANECDOTE, GARY.

292
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,014
HERE'S AN ANECDOTE--

293
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,149
TODAY I MET THE MOST
BORING MAN IN THE WORLD.

294
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,885
HIS NAME WAS GARY.

295
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:18,886
- HMM.

296
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,888
- NOW...

297
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,155
KEITH.

298
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,657
UNDER SEX, YOU WROTE...

299
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:26,694
"YES. HA HA, HA HA,
HA HA."

300
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,896
WELL-PLAYED.
- THANK YOU.

301
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,430
AH, BUT ALL JOKES ASIDE.

302
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,967
I'M A BOY.
[laughs]

303
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,202
- KEITH, I HAD THIS JOB
FOR FOUR YEARS.

304
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,005
AND I CAN TELL YOU, YOU GET OUT
OF IT WHAT YOU PUT INTO IT.

305
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,306
WHAT ARE YOU HOPING
TO GET OUT OF IT?

306
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,941
- IN LIKE A MONTH OR SO.

307
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,375
- WHAT?
- OH...WHAT!

308
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,312
WHAT AM I HOPING
TO GET OUT OF THIS JOB?

309
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,914
- YEAH.

310
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,016
- YEAH. LIKE ONE--
ONE MONTH OF MONEY...

311
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,984
WOULD BE--
WOULD BE JUST RIGHT.

312
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,886
- LET ME GIVE YOU
A SITUATION.

313
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,455
YOU'RE HOSTING A TOWN HALL
MEETING FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES.

314
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,990
- UH...
THAT'S SO MUCH STUFF.

315
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:00,027
[laughs]
YOU JUST, UH...KEPT ON GOING.

316
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,194
- THAT WAS LIKE ONE THING.

317
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,896
I DIDN'T EVEN GET
TO THE SITUATION YET.

318
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,298
- OH!
ALL RIGHT.

319
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,167
WELL, THANKS, GUYS.
[clears throat]

320
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,303
I THINK WE'VE ALL SEEN ENOUGH.

321
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,439
STILL NOT TOTALLY SURE
WHAT I'M APPLYING FOR.

322
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:16,009
BUT...IF YOU ASK ME,
I THINK IT WENT PRETTY WELL.

323
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:19,179
- WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON
IS HOW TO DESTROY PERU,

324
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,214
SPECIFICALLY
ONE PERSON WHO LIVES THERE.

325
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,350
- MADAME AMBASSADOR,
ARE YOU CHANGING THE SCENARIO?

326
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,418
WE DIDN'T PREPARE FOR THIS.

327
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,921
- GLOBAL POLITICS CAN CHANGE,
AND SCENARIOS CAN ARISE

328
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,190
AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE JUST LIKE,
"WAIT, I THOUGHT THIS ONE THING,

329
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,892
"BUT LOOK OVER THERE.
THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING,

330
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,293
AND IT'S CHANGING EVERYTHING,"
AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT?"

331
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,429
HOLD UP."
WHO HAS TANKS FOR ME?

332
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,098
- I-I'M SORRY, BUT...

333
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,167
WE'RE GONNA KEEP TRYING
TO SOLVE THE FOOD CRISIS.

334
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,402
- FOOD SCHMOOD.
THIS IS WAR.

335
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,172
GOD, IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO NUT UP, SWITZERLAND.

336
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,040
WELL, WELL, WELL,
LOOK WHO IS BRAVE ENOUGH

337
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,441
TO SHOW HIS FACE IN EUROPE.

338
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,110
- SAY THE WORD, LESLIE.

339
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,445
I'LL SICK MY ARMY
OF LIONS ON HIM.

340
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,181
- OKAY, LOOK, I THINK, UM...

341
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,017
THINGS ARE STARTING TO GET
A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL HERE.

342
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,151
- I AGREE.
YOU BETRAYED ME,

343
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:01,054
AND YOU WENT BEHIND MY BACK,
AND NOW YOU NEED TO PAY.

344
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,222
- I NEED TO--I NEED TO PAY.

345
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,891
- DO I STUTTER?

346
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,192
- OH. OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH.

347
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,227
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU MIGHT WANNA BORROW THIS.

348
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,162
- EW, NO ONE WANTS YOUR
DIRTY UNDERWEAR, BEN.

349
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,364
- IT'S NOT DIRTY UNDERWEAR.
IT'S A WHITE FLAG,

350
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,133
AND YOU MAY AS WELL START
WAVING IT RIGHT NOW--

351
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,434
- THE ONLY THING
I WILL BE WAVING

352
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,169
IS YOUR DECAPITATED HEAD
ON A STICK

353
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,072
IN FRONT OF YOUR
WEEPING MOTHER!

354
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,474
- GOOD LORD.

355
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,377
- REALLY,
ANYTHING WOULD BE BETTER

356
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,046
THAN THE PEOPLE
WE INTERVIEWED TODAY.

357
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,915
- I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT, TOM.

358
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,216
I'M NOT GONNA FIND
ANOTHER YOU.

359
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,250
YOU WERE PERFECT.

360
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,921
COMPETENT ENOUGH TO KEEP
THE BOSSES OFF MY BACK,

361
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,456
BUT SELFISH ENOUGH
TO SLOW DOWN ALL THE WORK.

362
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,458
TOM HAVERFORDS
DON'T GROW ON TREES.

363
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,961
- IF THEY DID,
I'D SELL 'EM.

364
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,295
TOMMY TREES.

365
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,197
- WOULD YOU CONSIDER
COMING BACK?

366
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,034
- SORRY, RON.
NO CAN DO.

367
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,036
I'M LIKE A SHARK.
I DON'T SWIM BACKWARDS.

368
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,204
SEE YA LATER, MAN.

369
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,042
- WE'VE BEEN MAKING
GREAT STRIDES

370
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,077
WITH GENETICALLY MODIFIED
CROPS

371
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,479
AND WOULD GLADLY PLEDGE
TO CONTINUE THE GROWTH OF--

372
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,048
- EXCUSE ME,
MADAME AMBASSADOR.

373
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,215
EXCUSE ME.
- I'M NOT FINISHED.

374
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,416
- OH, REALLY?

375
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,452
THEN WHY DO I HAVE
THE MICROPHONE?

376
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:09,957
I MOVE THAT THE SECURITY COUNCIL
FORMALLY CONDEMN DENMARK

377
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,258
AND STOP THEM FROM MAKING

378
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,094
ANY MORE UNWARRANTED
ACTS OF AGGRESSION.

379
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,529
- AS LONG AS YOU QUIT
DERAILING THE CONFERENCE.

380
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,398
PEOPLE ARE DYING OF HUNGER
IN AFRICA.

381
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,100
- OH, CRY ME A RIVER.

382
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,434
- ALL IN FAVOR
OF THE RESOLUTION.

383
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,305
- WHAT?!
- OH, THAT'S INTERESTING.

384
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,308
THE RESOLUTION PASSES
WITH FLYING COLORS.

385
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:31,044
DENMARK IS FORMALLY CONDEMNED.

386
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,412
BAM!

387
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,516
- THAT'S NO PROBLEMO, PERU,

388
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,519
BECAUSE DENMARK NO LONGER
RECOGNIZES THE AUTHORITY

389
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,454
OF THIS INTERNATIONAL
GANG OF THUGS.

390
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,124
AND HISTORY
WILL BE UNKIND TO THOSE

391
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,159
WHO STAND OPPOSED
TO JUSTICE.

392
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:49,362
TOGETHER, WE STAND--
AND I ASK ALL OF YOU--

393
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:53,200
WHO IS READY TO JOIN
THE COALITION OF THE WILLING?

394
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,068
[pounding shoe]

395
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,470
- THE MOON SHALL JOIN
YOUR COALITION.

396
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,106
- YEAH!
WE GOT THE FREAKING MOON.

397
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,975
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITHOUT TIDES, PERU?

398
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,344
- OKAY. WE NEED TO STOP DEALING
IN HYPOTHETICALS.

399
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,280
ANN, WE DATED.
WHAT HAPPENED TO US?

400
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,183
- REALLY?
DO YOU...WANNA GET REAL?

401
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,319
- SURE.
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

402
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,122
- SOMETIMES YOUR RELENTLESS
CHEERINESS IS CONFUSING.

403
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,024
LIKE THAT TIME WE WENT
TO EAGLETON

404
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,192
AND WE GOT THAT HOTEL ROOM
WITH THE JACUZZI...

405
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,928
- OOH, THIS JUST GOT REAL GOOD!

406
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,329
- AND THE JACUZZI BROKE.
- [sighs]

407
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,431
- BUT I DID...EAT FOOD
OFF OF YOUR BODY.

408
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:27,200
- OH, COME ON.
- ALL RIGHT, CHRIS AND ANN!

409
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,336
- I JUST WANNA
GO BACK TO WORK.

410
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,104
- SO THE COALITION
OF THE WILLING

411
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:33,340
IS DENMARK, BOTSWANA,
AND THE MOON.

412
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,942
- THE BIG THREE.

413
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,143
- NOW, HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

414
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:39,012
BEN IS PROBABLY SHORING UP
HIS SUPPORT IN SOUTH AMERICA.

415
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,447
WHILE HE DOES THAT,
WE ARE GONNA MAKE SURE--

416
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,549
[pounding]
- ATTENTION!

417
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,152
THE SECURITY COUNCIL
HAS DECIDED TO EXPEL

418
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:48,055
PERU AND DENMARK
FROM THE UNITED NATIONS.

419
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,057
- MADAME AMBASSADEUR...
POURQUOI?

420
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,325
- 'CAUSE YOU GUYS SUCK.
LOOK AROUND.

421
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:55,963
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
TEACH US HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.

422
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:59,066
YOU'VE RUINED MY FAVORITE CLUB.
THANKS A LOT.

423
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,234
- DID WE WIN?

424
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,336
I THINK WE WON!

425
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,439
WHAT WERE WE TRYING TO DO?
I LEARNED SO MUCH TODAY.

426
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,378
- AHEM.

427
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,313
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

428
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,182
THAT I THOUGHT
IT WAS REALLY COOL

429
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,350
HOW EVERYTHING
FELL APART IN THERE.

430
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,121
AND ALSO,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO BEN.

431
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,490
- NO. HE'S BEING A JERK.

432
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,059
- PLEASE?
WHEN BEN GETS UPSET,

433
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,328
HE BECOMES
A REALLY BAD ROOMMATE.

434
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,363
HE TAKES REALLY LONG
SADNESS BATHS

435
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:33,066
AND MAKES ME LATE FOR STUFF.

436
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,068
- [sighs]

437
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,070
I HATE IT HERE.

438
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,206
CAN'T WAIT TO GRADUATE.

439
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:45,412
- YEAH, BUT SUMMER'S
GONNA TOTALLY KICK ASS.

440
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,214
- SO YOU'RE SAYING

441
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,316
THAT I INTIMIDATED YOU?

442
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,018
- NO. NOT EXACTLY.
- COME ON.

443
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,286
TALK MORE ABOUT THAT TANTRIC
WORKSHOP Y'ALL WENT TO.

444
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,288
- I WAS SO INTO YOU, OKAY,

445
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,191
AND YOU BASICALLY TURNED ME INTO
A FEMALE VERSION OF YOURSELF,

446
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,292
AND THEN YOU GOT BORED
DATING ME

447
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,995
BECAUSE YOU WERE
DATING YOURSELF.

448
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,230
- HUH...

449
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,232
- I MEAN, I WAS JOGGING.
I HATE JOGGING.

450
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,401
- [laughs] JOGGING'S AMAZING!
- JOGGING IS THE WORST, CHRIS.

451
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,436
I MEAN, I KNOW IT KEEPS YOU
HEALTHY,

452
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,071
BUT GOD, AT WHAT COST?

453
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,273
- WELL, I'M SORRY THAT I ADDED
FIVE YEARS TO YOUR LIFE.

454
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,475
NOW I'M BEING SARCASTIC.

455
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,477
LIKE YOU. I'M DOING
SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE.

456
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,012
- BEING WITH YOU

457
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,081
DEFINITELY MADE ME DO
A LOT OF SOUL-SEARCHING,

458
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,415
AND I CAME OUT THE OTHER SIDE

459
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,517
BEING A MUCH MORE
SELF-POSSESSED PERSON.

460
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,219
- WELL, I'M GLAD.

461
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,355
- GOOD LUCK WITH MILLICENT.
JUST BACK OFF A LITTLE BIT.

462
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,757
LET HER BE HERSELF.
EVERYTHING'LL BE FINE.

463
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,559
- THANK YOU.

464
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,761
- IF YOU REARRANGE
THE LETTERS OF PERU,

465
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,164
YOU COULD SPELL EUROPE.

466
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,365
- THAT'S...
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

467
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,367
- WELL...
YOU HAVE TO REARRANGE THEM.

468
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,102
- OH...
- DELEGATES!

469
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,071
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ANGRY
WITH EACH OTHER.

470
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,305
HOPEFULLY, THIS WILL BE
YOUR OPPORTUNITY

471
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,208
TO HAVE YOUR VERY OWN
CAMP DAVID.

472
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,509
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

473
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,078
MY BUDDY DAVID FUNDIS
WOULD HAVE

474
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:52,745
THESE CAMPOUTS
IN HIS BACKYARD.

475
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,748
WE WOULD JUST CHILL OUT,
HAVE A BONFIRE,

476
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,085
TALK ABOUT WHATEVER
WAS ON OUR MIND.

477
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,753
WE CALLED IT CAMP DAVID.

478
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,322
- HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
CAMP DAVID?

479
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,790
- HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
CAMP DAVID?

480
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,492
- OOOOKAY.

481
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,527
YOU GUYS ARE BEING STUPID,
SO WHY DON'T YOU WORK IT OUT

482
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,099
WHILE ANDY AND I...
- THROW THESE SCIENTIST BOTTLES

483
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,100
OFF THE ROOF?
- NO.

484
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,301
- THAT'S RIGHT.
SEE YA.

485
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:18,305
GO. GO. GO. GO. GO.
[running footsteps]

486
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,307
- IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT WE CAN'T BE TOGETHER,

487
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,110
BUT THE THOUGHT OF US
NOT BEING FRIENDS IS...

488
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,112
IS JUST TOO CRAPPY
FOR ME TO HANDLE.

489
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,414
- I WAS...PERHAPS

490
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,083
A LITTLE ICIER
THAN I NEEDED TO BE.

491
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:32,319
- I JUST NEED YOU
TO BE IN MY LIFE.

492
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,754
YOU'RE TOO IMPORTANT TO ME.

493
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,389
- I WISH I COULD SAY
IT'S POSSIBLE.

494
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:38,391
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW
IF IT IS RIGHT NOW.

495
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,460
- [exhales]

496
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,762
WELL, I PROPOSE A TREATY

497
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,765
THAT STATES THAT WE HAVE
A FUN CONVERSATION

498
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,402
ONCE A DAY AT WORK
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

499
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:52,239
- I'LL TAKE IT
TO THE PERUVIAN SENATE.

500
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,373
OR WHATEVER.

501
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,441
- PLEASE DO THAT.
- I'LL TRY.

502
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,542
I'LL SEE WHAT THEY SAY.

503
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,810
- WHAT DO WE DO
WITH THOSE KIDS?

504
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,011
WE TOTALLY RUINED
THEIR CLUB.

505
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,814
- I COULD TELL YOU WHAT I WOULD
LIKE WHEN I WAS THEIR AGE.

506
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,516
- BEN, HOW ARE WE GONNA GET
KATHY IRELAND

507
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,518
TO DO NAKED AEROBICS
FOR THEM?

508
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,255
- OKAY. I REGRET
TELLING YOU THAT...VERY MUCH.

509
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,822
[both laughing]

510
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,358
- HEY.

511
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,126
- OH, HEY, RON.

512
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,295
- ALL RIGHT.
I GOTTA COME CLEAN.

513
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:18,365
I SAW YOU SPRAYING
COLOGNE SAMPLES AT MACY'S.

514
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,467
- WHAT? MACY'S?
THAT WASN'T ME.

515
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,902
THERE'S A MACY'S IN TOWN?
WHERE'S THE MACY'S IN TOWN?

516
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,238
I HEARD THEY HAVE AN AMAZING
COLOGNE SAMPLE GUY.

517
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,907
- JUST TAKE THE JOB, TOMMY.
COME ON BACK.

518
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,776
- I QUIT TO PERUSE MY DREAM.

519
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,245
AND MY DREAM COLLAPSED.
IT'S EMBARRASSING, RON.

520
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,448
I CAN'T GO FROM A CEO
BACK TO BEING AN ADMINISTRATOR.

521
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,917
- IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO

522
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,587
TO MAKE YOU FEEL OKAY
ABOUT COMING BACK?

523
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,322
EVERYONE, PLEASE...

524
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,224
HELP ME.

525
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,326
I'M TRYING TO GET TOM BACK.

526
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,428
I'M...

527
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,530
BEGGING.

528
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,166
THIS DEPARTMENT JUST DOESN'T
WORK WITHOUT YOU.

529
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,601
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

530
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:58,171
- RON, THIS IS EMBARRASSING.
EVEN FOR YOU.

531
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,773
I'M NOT COMING BACK.

532
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,243
PEACE OUT, MY DUDES.

533
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,547
- EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE.

534
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:13,886
- THAT WAS GREAT.

535
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,522
SO WHAT I'M THINKING IS
I'LL COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS,

536
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:16,523
YOU'LL BEG ME AGAIN--

537
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:17,790
AAH!

538
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,526
SO IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU GUYS,

539
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,794
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK RON
FOR MY JOB BACK.

540
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,196
RON...

541
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,565
MAY I HAVE
MY JOB BACK, PLEASE?

542
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,536
THANK YOU.

543
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,272
I WILL SEE YOU ALL MONDAY.

544
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,375
- LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

545
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,477
- AH, FRANCE,

546
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,511
BIENVENUE.

547
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:39,912
- MY NAME IS CASSIDY,

548
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,581
AND I'M REALLY ANNOYED WITH YOU.
- YES.

549
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,516
AND YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO BE,

550
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,219
BUT WE'RE HOPING WHAT WE'RE
GONNA SHOW YOU RIGHT NOW

551
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,320
WILL MAKE UP FOR THAT.

552
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,988
- WHAT?
- OH, MY GOD!

553
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,791
- PAWNEE
CITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS.

554
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,794
THE NICEST ROOM IN CITY HALL
BY A FACTOR OF LIKE A MILLION.

555
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,297
GO AHEAD.
SIT DOWN.

556
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,499
- LESLIE AND I FEEL TERRIBLE

557
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,801
FOR WAR BREAKING OUT
AT YOUR MODEL U.N.

558
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,536
- WHICH, FOR THE RECORD,
DENMARK WOULD HAVE WON,

559
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,904
BUT THAT'S NEITHER HERE
NOR THERE.

560
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,873
THANKS TO A COORDINATED EFFORT

561
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,242
BETWEEN THE PARKS DEPARTMENT
AND THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE,

562
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:10,610
THREE MONTHS FROM NOW,
WE ARE GONNA HOLD

563
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,513
A STATE-WIDE MODEL U.N.
IN THIS ROOM,

564
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,249
AND YOU'RE GONNA RUN THE SHOW.
- WHAT?

565
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:18,518
- AND WE WILL JUST BE...
NOT HERE.

566
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,787
OR TAKING SOME SMALL COUNTRIES.
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

567
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,921
- NO. FINE.
NOT HERE.

568
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,956
SOUND GOOD?
kids: YES!

569
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,393
- THOSE KIDS ARE PASSIONATE
ABOUT SOMETHING.

570
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,327
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

571
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,864
THAT'S ALL THERE IS, REALLY,
IS PASSION.

572
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,434
PASSION IS WHAT MAKES
FOR GOOD TREATIES...

573
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,436
- CHEESE!
- GOOD RELATIONSHIPS...

574
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,804
GOOD PIZZA.

575
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,005
GOOD FRIENDS.

576
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,807
GOOD EVERYTHING.

577
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,276
INCLUDING WARS.

578
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:48,848
- "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

579
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:49,849
"HE WAS GONE BUT NEVER
FORGOTTEN.

580
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,318
HE MAKES ALL THE LADIES
WANT--"

581
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,819
NO, I'M NOT
GONNA SAY THAT.

582
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,422
"SWAGGER...BEATS...

583
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,857
AND I GET THE...
WHO'S THE--"

584
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,058
ALL RIGHT, FORGET IT.

585
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,294
WELCOME BACK,
TOM HAVERFORD!

586
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,897
- TICK-TOCK,
IT'S TOMMY TIME!

587
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,066
- I'M SORRY,
I HAVE TO OBJECT AGAIN.

588
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,869
THIS JUST SEEMS UNFAIR.
- I UNDERSTAND THAT, JERRY.

589
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,938
BUT THE PROBLEM IS
IS THAT TOM CAME BACK

590
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:14,574
AND ANDY'S MY ASSISTANT,
SO I KINDA NEED HIM CLOSE TO ME.

591
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,509
- OKAY, BUT I CAN'T EVEN
HEAR ANYTHING

592
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:19,379
BECAUSE OF THE NOISE
FROM THE COPIER.

593
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:21,414
- SORRY. THESE ARE
REALLY IMPORTANT.
