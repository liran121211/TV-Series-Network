00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,603
[knock on door]

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:05,439
- MISS LESLIE KNOPE,
I PRESENT TO YOU HERB SCAIFER.

3
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:06,707
- AGAIN, ANDY,
YOU DON'T NEED TO BOW.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,242
- AS YOU WISH, MA'AM.

5
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:09,377
- OKAY, HERB,
WHAT CAN I DO YOU FOR?

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,314
- WELL, PLEASE PREPARE YOURSELF,
I HAVE TERRIBLE NEWS.

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,315
- YOU DO?

8
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,417
- THE WORLD IS GOING
TO END TOMORROW AT DAWN.

9
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,752
- AW NUTS.
YOU SURE IT'S TOMORROW?

10
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:21,455
- AFRAID SO.
RIGHT AT DAWN.

11
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,091
- MM-HMM.
- THE ENTIRE PLANET--

12
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,825
[explosion sound]

13
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,060
[laughs] GONE.

14
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:27,361
- NOT GIVING ME
MUCH NOTICE, HERB.

15
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:29,463
LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
- OKAY.

16
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,332
- FOR A WHILE IN THE 1970s,

17
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,767
OUR TOWN WAS RUN
BY A FREAKY CULT.

18
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:35,769
EVERY FEW YEARS,
THE REMAINING MEMBERS

19
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,238
PREDICT THE WORLD'S
GONNA END,

20
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,640
AND THEY HAVE AN ALL-NIGHT
VIGIL IN THE PARK.

21
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,542
IT'S SUPER ANNOYING.

22
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,511
TURNS OUT WHEN YOU THINK
THE WORLD'S ENDING,

23
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,647
YOU DON'T AIM SO CAREFULLY
IN THE PORT-A-POTTIES.

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,650
[upbeat music]

25
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:57,691
*

26
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,337
- TONIGHT, THE FOLLOWERS
OF REASONABLEISM

27
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,506
WILL BE JOINING TOGETHER
TO AWAIT THE RETURN OF ZORP.

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,376
THE GIANT LIZARD GOD
WHO WILL DESTROY THE EARTH

29
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,178
WITH HIS CLEANSING
FIRE OF JUDGMENT.

30
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,712
ALSO, LIGHT REFRESHMENTS
WILL BE SERVED.

31
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,381
- OH, LAST YEAR,
THEY HAD PIZZA.

32
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,582
ARE THEY GOING
TO GET PIZZA AGAIN?

33
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,452
- UM, SAYS THEY'VE GOT
TURKEY SANDWICHES

34
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,554
AND THE NECTAR
OF A THOUSAND SORROWS.

35
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,222
- OH, THAT IS SO GOOD.

36
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:30,358
IT'S ROOT BEER AND RED WINE.

37
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,526
I WENT TO ONE MEETING.

38
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:37,498
- WAIT!

39
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:38,866
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU,
ENORMOUS CHAIR.

40
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,401
- YOU REALLY SAT IN THIS THING?

41
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,870
- YEAH, I LOVED IT.

42
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,238
FELT LIKE A TINY KING.

43
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,609
- [annoying cry]

44
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,279
T-CUPS, WE DID IT, BABY!

45
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,381
WE BUILT A COMPANY
FROM THE GROUND-UP.

46
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,316
- AND THEN WE RAN IT
BACK INTO THE GROUND.

47
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,185
- WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING
TO REMEMBER

48
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:59,653
IS IT WAS A MASSIVE SUCCESS.

49
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,189
REMY MARTIN?

50
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,324
- WELL,
ENTERTAINMENT720 IS DEAD.

51
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:04,825
IT'S UP IN COMPANY HEAVEN.

52
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,928
ALONG WITH PETS.COM,
BLOCKBUSTER AND ASKJEEVES.

53
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,531
MY COMPANY IS NO BETTER
THAN A COMPANY WHERE YOU ASK

54
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,634
A FAKE BUTLER
TO GOOGLE THINGS FOR YOU.

55
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:17,405
- HELLO!

56
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:19,373
- SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL EACH
END UP WITH ABOUT $5,000 APIECE.

57
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,309
- [brake screeching noise]
STOP.

58
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,444
WE GET FIVE G'S EACH?
THAT'S AMAZING!

59
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,380
YOU STARTED OUT WITH 450,000.

60
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:28,249
- HEY, YOU REMEMBER
WHEN DJ BLUNTZ

61
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,451
MADE US OUR OWN
PERSONAL ENTRANCE BEATS?

62
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,886
- REMEMBER THE OPENING NIGHT
PARTY WHEN YOU DANCED SO HARD

63
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,456
WITH TESSA THE RECEPTIONIST
THAT YOU BROKE ONE OF YOUR RIBS?

64
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,192
- [laughs]
IT NEVER HEALED PROPERLY.

65
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,960
- [laughs]
- EVERY BREATH IS AGONY, SON.

66
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,929
[laughter]

67
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,597
- STOP.

68
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,399
SO WHAT'S NEXT,
TOMMY DAVIDSON?

69
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:46,867
I SAY WE INVEST OUR TEN LARGE

70
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,404
AND THEN I "ACCIDENTALLY"
GET RUN OVER BY A CITY BUS

71
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:51,605
AND WE START OUR OWN
HIP-HOP LABEL.

72
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,608
- LISTEN, WE COULD
PLAY IT SAFE,

73
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,344
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT E720 WAS ALL ABOUT.

74
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:58,579
- NO IT WAS NOT.

75
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,381
- WE HAVE THIS PLACE
FOR ONE MORE NIGHT, RIGHT?

76
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,749
- WE'RE OUTTIE TOMORROW AT NOON.

77
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:05,519
- WHAT IF WE TOOK
EVERY DIME WE HAD LEFT,

78
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:06,954
THREW ONE LAST PARTY.

79
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:07,888
MADE IT THE ESSENCE

80
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,657
OF EVERYTHING WE WANTED
THE COMPANY TO BE.

81
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,725
A PARTY...

82
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,327
FOR THE END OF THE WORLD.

83
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,697
- SHH! YOU HAD ME AT
"EVERY DIME WE HAVE LEFT."

84
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,233
BECAUSE I'M IN
LIKE LARA FLYNN...

85
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:21,535
BOYLE...FROM THE PRACTICE.

86
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:26,274
both: DILLY DILLY DILLY
DILLY DILLY DILLY DILLY SWAG!

87
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:29,443
- WHY DOES THE CULT CALL
THEMSELVES THE REASONABLEISTS?

88
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,579
- WELL, THEY FIGURE IF
PEOPLE CRITICIZE THEM

89
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:32,480
IT'LL SEEM LIKE THEY'RE

90
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,014
ATTACKING SOMETHING
VERY REASONABLE.

91
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,616
- THAT'S WEIRDLY BRILLIANT.

92
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,251
- LOOK, THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

93
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:38,886
THEY'VE SAID THAT THE WORLD
IS GOING TO END 15 TIMES.

94
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,488
AND THE ONLY BAD THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED

95
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:41,822
ON ANY OF THOSE DATES IS

96
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,658
LANCE ARMSTRONG
DUMPING SHERYL CROW.

97
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:46,527
- THAT WAS A TRAGIC DAY.
- HMM.

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,662
- LIVE STRONG.

99
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:51,399
IN ANY RATE, I THINK BEN AND I
SHOULD ACCOMPANY YOU TONIGHT.

100
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,501
- OH, I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE TO DO THAT.

101
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,835
- NO, NO, NO, I INSIST.

102
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,705
THESE PEOPLE
LIVE ON PLANET NUTBRAIN.

103
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,508
I LIVE ON PLANET NUT BRAN.

104
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,576
BRAN AND NUTS ARE VERY
HELPFUL FOR YOUR COLON!

105
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,844
- OH, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE KIND OF FORCED

106
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,379
TO HANG OUT WITH EACH OTHER.

107
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,281
- YEAH, LISTEN,
I'LL--I'LL COME FOR A BIT,

108
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:09,383
BUT IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
I'M NOT GOING TO STAY.

109
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:13,354
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
STILL KIND OF WEIRD, RIGHT?

110
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,489
- YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

111
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,525
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
MM-HMM, TOTALLY GET IT.

112
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:18,459
DEFINITELY GET IT.

113
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:19,960
BEN AND I DON'T
HANG OUT MUCH THESE DAYS.

114
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,430
BIG DEAL,
LOTS OF PEOPLE DON'T HANG OUT.

115
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:26,700
JERRY AND APRIL.
OBAMA AND MADONNA, PROBABLY.

116
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:27,835
WE'RE IN GOOD COMPANY.

117
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,337
[metal plinks]

118
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,938
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO TONIGHT?

119
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,506
- I DON'T KNOW, I JUST FIGURE
WE'LL JUST ORDER SOME PIZZA.

120
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,674
YOU WATCH ME PLAY XBOX,

121
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:34,942
AND THEN I COULD WATCH YOU
MAKE SOME PRANK PHONE CALLS?

122
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,377
WE GET HAMMERED?
MAKE OUT?

123
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,446
- WE DO THAT EVERY NIGHT.

124
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,449
- THAT'S BECAUSE REPETITION
IS THE KEY TO A GOOD MARRIAGE.

125
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,884
- LET'S DO SOMETHING WEIRD.

126
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,753
COME ON, IT COULD BE
THE LAST NIGHT ON EARTH.

127
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,721
- WE COULD DO SOMETHING
OFF MY BUCKET LIST.

128
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,323
- YOU HAVE A BUCKET LIST?

129
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,725
- CATCH THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN
AT THE SUPER BOWL.

130
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,428
MAKE THE MOST AMAZING
GRILLED-CHEESE SANDWICH EVER.

131
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:55,963
WIN THE LOTTERY.
RIDE A UNICYCLE.

132
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,566
INVENT SOMETHING.
FLY FIRST CLASS ON A PLANE.

133
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,836
AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE WALKING BY,
BE LIKE THIS.

134
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,505
[soft laugh]

135
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,873
GO SKYDIVING.
OUTRUN A HIPPO.

136
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,542
I'D LIKE TO REMAKE THE MOVIE
SHAZAAM WITH SHAQUILLE O'NEAL

137
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,010
WHERE HE PLAYS A GENIE
AND I'D LIKE TO GET IT RIGHT.

138
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,947
TEACH MY SON...
TO THROW THE PERFECT SPIRAL.

139
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,050
HAVE A SON.

140
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,086
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, THIS IS
WHAT WE'RE DOING TONIGHT.

141
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,588
- WAIT, WHICH ONE?

142
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,490
WE COULD CHANGE
MY CELL PHONE PLAN!

143
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,859
THAT WOULD BE FUN.
- NO, THIS ONE.

144
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,462
- 800, 900, 1,000.
- [excited laugh]

145
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,598
- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
IS LEFT IN THE BANK ACCOUNT?

146
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,965
- EIGHTEEN DOLLARS
AND FOUR CENTS.

147
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,967
- WHOA!
STILL A LOT LEFT OVER.

148
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,471
- OKAY, YOU WANTED TO HOLD
$1,000 CASH IN YOUR HANDS,

149
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:43,877
- THAT'S SUPER DISAPPOINTING.

150
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:49,417
- 998, 999, 1000.

151
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,651
- YES!

152
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,421
NOW THIS IS WHAT I IMAGINED!

153
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,889
[ecstatic laugh]

154
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,959
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS MUCH
CASH IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE?

155
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,594
- I JUST HANDED IT TO YOU.

156
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:02,896
- [laughs] NICKELS!

157
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,897
I WANT NICKELS.

158
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,666
A BILLION NICKELS!
- NO, ANDY.

159
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,836
- HEY, HERB?
- YEAH.

160
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,170
- SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
- YEAH, SURE.

161
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,839
- LESLIE SAID YOU STILL
NEED TO PAY FOR THE PERMIT.

162
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,840
IT'S 28 DOLLARS.

163
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,709
- OH, I'M SORRY.

164
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:16,877
- HERE'S A CHECK.

165
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,413
YOU CAN CASH THAT...TOMORROW.

166
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:20,814
[all snickering]

167
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,650
- EVENING GENTLEMEN, LADIES.

168
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,418
all: HEY, RON!
- HAIL ZORP.

169
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,186
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M GREAT.

170
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,055
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT
FOR THE END OF THE WORLD.

171
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:31,525
CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL OF YOU
FOR REACHING THE FINISH LINE.

172
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,494
THE ZORPIES ARE RIDICULOUS.

173
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,796
BUT, LIKE THE FOUNDING FATHERS,

174
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,165
I BELIEVE IN ABSOLUTE
FREEDOM OF RELIGION.

175
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:42,102
ALSO THEIR CEREMONIES REQUIRE
THE PLAYING OF FLUTES.

176
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:46,440
I HAPPEN TO MAKE FLUTES
IN MY WOOD SHOP.

177
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,642
FLUTES ARE $80 APIECE.

178

- HEY, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

180
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,115

00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,586
- SURE.

00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:14,868

00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,036
BUT SIX OPEN BARS.

193
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,673

00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,627
PASS OUT SHRIMP

203
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,495
- YES,

204
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,764
GOT A HEAD?
MAYBE YOU WANT A FREE FEDORA.

205

206

00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,804

210
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,006
OH, JUST ONE.

00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,279

214
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,181

00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,082
WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.

216
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,952
- DJ BLUNTZ IS MIXING UP
SOME NEW BEATS.

217
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,855
ONLY 200 PEOPLE WILL BE

[crickets chirping]

223
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,298
both: [relieved sigh]
- THANK GOD.

224
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,200
- NO ONE SHOWS UP
TO A GOOD PARTY ON TIME.

225
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,869
IF ANYBODY ACTUALLY
SHOWED UP RIGHT NOW,

226
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:22,903
THE WHOLE PARTY
WOULD HAVE BEEN RUINED.

227
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,037
- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A DISASTER.

228
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,673
I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO THAT PARTY.

229
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,175
- DOES THE CITY CONSIDER THEM
A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY?

230
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,878
- OH, NOT AT ALL,
SHAUNA MALWAE-TWEEP.

231
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,581
IT'S BEEN OVER THIRTY YEARS
SINCE THERE'S BEEN ANY INCIDENT

232
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,082
INVOLVING THE REASONABLEISTS.

233
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,117
- SO I SHOULDN'T INTERPRET
ANYTHING FROM THE FACT

234
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,286
THAT THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE FROM
THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE HERE?

235
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,989
- WELL, NOTHING EXCEPT THAT
I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO.

236
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,724
WHICH PROBABLY SAYS
MORE ABOUT ME THAN THEM.

237
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,258
- [laughs]
- THANKS.

238
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,260

00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,072

245
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,307
- SOMEHOW LONGER.

246
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,809
- RIGHT, OKAY LET'S
GO WITH THE FIRST ONE.

247
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:04,077
- GREAT, UM, HEY, ALSO...

248
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,046
HE'S CUTE.
IS HE SINGLE, DO YOU KNOW?

249
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,581
- CHRIS? NO.

250
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:09,016
HE'S ACTUALLY
DATING JERRY'S DAUGHTER.

251
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,018
- OH, NO SORRY, I MEANT BEN.
WHAT'S HIS STORY?

252
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,053
- WHO?
- BEN?

253
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,155
- I-I DON'T KNOW.

254
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:18,091
I--I'M NOT S--I'M NOT SURE.

255
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,360
HE'S, UM,
A MAN AND HE'S A WORKER.

256
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,264
AND HE IS--UH, WE'VE NEVER
DISCUSSED SEX SO...

257
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,267
IT'S--WE'VE ALWAYS JUST BEEN
VERY BUSINESSLIKE, SO...

258
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,171
YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD,
NAY, BETTER THAN MINE.

259
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,173
THE END.
BY LESLIE KNOPE.

260
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:36,243
- OKAY.
COOL, THANKS.

261
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,311
- H--HAPPY TO HELP.

262
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:41,281
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

263
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,916
- THE WORLD IS ENDING.

264
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,819
- OH, BOY,
I KNOW HOW THIS GOES.

265
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,320
I KNOW HOW SHAUNA OPERATES.

266
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,322
SHE SMILES,
AND THEN THEY FALL IN LOVE,

267
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:50,457
AND THEN THEY GET MARRIED,

268
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,760
AND THEN SHE CHANGES HER NAME
TO SHAUNA MALWAE-WYATT.

269
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,194
OR HE'S GOING
TO BE REALLY PROGRESSIVE

270
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,129
AND CHANGE HIS NAME TO
BEN WYATT-MALWAE-TWEEP.

271
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:59,733
GOD, I AM SO ANNOYED THAT HE
WOULD HYPOTHETICALLY DO THAT.

272
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,169
- OKAY, LESLIE
THEY'RE JUST TALKING.

273
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,671
- WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN JUST TALKING?

274
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,906
HE'S SMILING
AND SHE'S BEING VERY CHARMING.

275
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,007
IS SHE MORE CHARMING THAN ME?

276
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,743
ANN, IF YOU SAY YES,
I WILL KICK YOU, I SWEAR TO GOD.

277
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:10,778
- YOU'RE DEFINITELY
MORE CHARMING.

278
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,013
BUT I AM HERE TO REMIND YOU

279
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,247
THAT THE REASON
YOU'RE NOT DATING HIM

280
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,216
IS BECAUSE YOU DECIDED
TO RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL.

281
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,051
- OH, SO JUST BECAUSE
I CAN'T GO OUT WITH HIM,

282
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,386
SOMEONE ELSE CAN?

283
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,954
- OH, BOY, OKAY.
- WOW.

284
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:24,091
- OKAY, I'M SURE
THIS IS NOTHING.

285
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,827
OKAY, WELL, THAT WAS
DEFINITELY SOMETHING.

286
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,995
- OH. MY GOD.
- I KNOW THAT MOVE.

287
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,129
- THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE SEX IN FIVE MINUTES.

288
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,698
I'VE GOTTA STOP THIS.

289
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:31,865
I'VE GOT TO KEEP THEM
AWAY FROM EACH OTHER

290
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,233
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

291
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,836
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT?
- UNCLEAR!

292
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:39,239
- OH, YEAH, TEN BUCKS!

293
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,240
- THAT COUNTS AS
WINNING THE LOTTERY.

294
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:44,044
- [laughs] OKAY, NOW IS THIS
THE MOST AMAZING

295
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,113
GRILLED-CHEESE
SANDWICH EVER MADE?

296
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,215
- MMM, IT'S PRETTY AWESOME.

297
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,083
- HONEY, MY BUCKET LIST
DOESN'T SAY

298
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,820
"MAKE A PRETTY AWESOME
GRILLED-CHEESE SANDWICH."

299
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:54,154
GOTTA GO BACK TO THE STORE.

300
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,455
WE'RE GONNA GET
A DIFFERENT KIND OF CHEESE.

301
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,489
- NO, NO, NO, DUDE, SERIOUSLY.

302
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,158
THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING
GRILLED-CHEESE SANDWICH

303
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,226
EVER MADE, OKAY?

304
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,294
- [slams table]
OKAY. WHAT'S NEXT?

305
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,464
- HEY, THERE YOU ARE.
WOW, YOU TWO ARE STILL TALKING?

306
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,033
BEN HASN'T BORED YOU
TO DEATH BY NOW.

307
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,168
- HEY.
- SO BORING.

308
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,436
- ACTUALLY, WE WERE HAVING
A REALLY GREAT TALK.

309
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,339
- KEEP YOUR PANTS ON.
- WHAT?

310
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,941
- I MEAN,
KEEP YOUR PANTS ON, GIRL!

311
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,776
I MEAN, THOSE ARE
REALLY NICE PANTS.

312
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,177
I REALLY LIKE YOUR PANTS.
WHERE'D YOU GET THEM?

313
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,046
DO YOU WANT TO GO
BUY SOME MORE PANTS?

314
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,447
OR, UM, WALK AWAY FROM HERE?

315
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,850
- I ACTUALLY THINK I HAVE
EVERYTHING I NEED HERE,

316
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,885
BUT I MIGHT HEAD OVER TO
THAT END OF THE WORLD PARTY.

317
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,353
- OH, THAT'S WHERE ALL
THE LOSERS ARE GOING.

318
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,789
- YEAH, WHAT IS THAT?
TOM EMAILED ME.

319
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,791
I COULD CHECK THAT OUT.
- HURRRRR...

320
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,827
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD
STAY HERE THEN.

321
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,395
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO.

322
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,230
I MEAN, WHAT IF YOU'RE
NOT HERE WHEN ZORP SHOWS UP?

323
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:38,465
BOY, WOULD YOUR FACE BE RED.

324
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,133
- WHEN ZORP SHOWS UP,

325
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:44,805
YOUR FACES WILL BE
MELTED OFF AND USED AS FUEL.

326
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,740
- YOU WANT TO BE HERE
FOR THAT.

327
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:47,875
- I THINK
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

328
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,744
LESLIE, THANKS AS ALWAYS.

329
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,180
- WOW. WHAT AN UNBELIEVABLY
UNPLEASANT PERSON.

00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,784
[club music]

331
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:57,918
- [growl]

332
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,319
WITH YOUR BAD SELF.

333
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,021
- YOU READY?
- I'M READY.

334
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,823

IS YOURS TO KEEP.

335
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:03,824
HIT IT!

336
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,793

00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:08,528
- THE PERFECT PARTY.
IT'S AN ELUSIVE IDEA.

338
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,497
PEOPLE HAVE TO BE
COMPLETELY ENTERTAINED

339
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,366
FROM THE MOMENT THEY WALK IN,
TO THE MOMENT THEY LEAVE.

340
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,002
IT'S A GRAND EXPERIMENT.

341
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:18,171
AND I...AM A PARTY SCIENTIST.

342
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,540
WELCOME TO MY LABORATORY.

343
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,811
*

344
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:27,347
- SO YOU WERE LIVING HERE WHEN
REASONABLEISM FIRST SWEPT IN?

345
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,517
- I WAS. LOU PROZOTOVICH,
THEIR FOUNDER,

346
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,786
WAS AN OFFICE SUPPLY
SALESMAN.

347
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,322
ONE DAY, HE HAD
AN INTERESTING IDEA.

348
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,556
MAYBE HE COULD WRITE A BOOK

349
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,525
TO HELP PEOPLE
ORGANIZE THEIR OFFICES.

350
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,796
- ORGANIZE IT.
- THE BOOK WAS A BIG SUCCESS.

351
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,066
THEN LOU HAD ANOTHER
INTERESTING THOUGHT.

352
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,036
MAYBE THERE WAS
A 28-FOOT TALL LIZARD

353
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,105
WITH A VOLCANO FOR A MOUTH
WHO CONTROLLED THE UNIVERSE.

354
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,541
- THAT IS INTERESTING.
- SO HE WROTE A SECOND BOOK.

355
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,177
- ORGANIZE IT II:
ENGAGE WITH ZORP.

356
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,812
- YOU KNOW, COULD I HAVE
A LOOK AT THAT?

357
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:02,582
- WELL, SURE YOU CAN, CHRIS.
YOU CAN KEEP IT.

358
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,886
I'D SKIP THE FIRST COUPLE
CHAPTERS IF I WERE YOU.

359
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,355
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
IT DOESN'T REALLY GET GOOD

360
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,423
UNTIL ZORP SHOWS UP.

361
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:14,227
- ZORP IS THE LIZARD.
WHAT RELIGION AM I?

362
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:18,031
WELL, I'M A PRACTICING NONE
OF YOUR [bleep] BUSINESS.

363
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,933
- OKAY, I'M READY!
- GOOD.

364
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,602
- WAIT!
I'M NOT READY. SUPER SCARED.

365
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,537
- ANDY, YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO BE AN ACTION STAR.

366
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:25,873
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.

367
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,508
- OKAY.

368
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:32,279
- OKAY, YOU, NATALIE,
FOLLOW THE ACTION.

369
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,881
- WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

370
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:34,848
- JUST HOLD UP THIS
BUTTER KNIFE TO MY THROAT

371
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,016
AND PRETEND LIKE
YOU'RE HOLDING ME HOSTAGE.

372
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,885
- WHAT?
- READY!

373
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,420
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT SEEMS A LITTLE CRAZY.

374
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,990
JUST CRAZY ENOUGH TO WORK.

375
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,591
- [fake cry]

376
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,495
- AAH!

377
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:52,499
- AHH!
OH, MY FACE!

378
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:53,533
MY FACE!

379
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,269
IS FINE, MIKHAIL PETROV!

380
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,505
- FORGET IT, MACKLIN,
YOU'RE TOO LATE--

381
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,607
I'M SORRY, GUYS.
- JERRY!

382
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,342
- I NEED MY CHEATERS.
I CANNOT SEE ANYTH--

383
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,877
- YOU'RE DOING REALLY GOOD,
YOU'RE DOING REALLY GOOD.

384
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:04,912
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

385
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,613
- HELP ME,
AGENT MACKLIN, HELP ME!

386
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:09,116
HE'S STOLEN MY JEWELS, AND NOW
HE'S GOING TO RAVISH MY BODY

387
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,051
AND HE STINKS,
HE REALLY STINKS!

388
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:14,221
- OKAY, JANET SNAKEHOLE BELONGS
TO MOTHER RUSSIA NOW.

389
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,488
- OH, THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK!

390
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,457
- NO.
- I HOPE YOU LIKE PAIN!

391
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,992
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- POW!

392
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,160
- SAY THE LINE.

393
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,229
- LOOKS LIKE THIS SIBERIAN HUSKY

394
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,531
IS GOING TO BE RUSSIAN...

395
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,434
OFF TO JAIL.

396
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,503
- HEY, KNOW WHAT, CAN I GO?
GAYLE IS MAKING A ROAST.

397
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,205
UGH.

398
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:35,208
[flute music]

399
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:43,083
*

400
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,517
[applause]

401
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,520
- THAT WAS SYMPHONY FOR
THE RIGHTEOUS DESTRUCTION

402
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,589
OF HUMANITY IN E MINOR.

403
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,458
BY THE LATE LOU PROZOTOVICH.

404
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:55,028
REMINDER. THESE FLUTES ARE
AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE.

405
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,230
YOU CAN'T TAKE IT
WITH YOU PEOPLE.

406
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,933
- HERB, I JUST SPEED-READ
BOTH OF YOUR BOOKS.

407
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,101
- OOH.
- AND, FULL DISCLOSURE,

408
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,303
I THINK THEY'RE
BONKERS-FILLED.

409
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,671
BUT I DID NOTICE THAT YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN REINCARNATION.

410
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,406
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

411
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,575
- WELL, IT MAKES SENSE,
DOESN'T IT?

412
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:13,113
FROM THE UNIVERSE, WE EMERGE.
INTO THE UNIVERSE, WE RETURN.

413
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,682
AND THERE ARE INFINITE
FORMS WE CAN TAKE

414
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,451
IN INFINITE UNIVERSES.

415
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,087
- WHAT A LOVELY THOUGHT.

416
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,257
- WELL, THIS MORNING AT DAWN,
YOU WILL TAKE A NEW FORM.

417
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,660
THAT OF A FLESHLESS,
CHATTERING SKELETON

418
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:31,698
WHEN ZORP THE SURVEYOR ARRIVES
AND BURNS YOUR FLESH OFF

419
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,167
WITH HIS VOLCANO MOUTH.

420
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:35,468
[chuckling]

421
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,104
- THAT WAS VERY STRANGE
WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

422
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,571
I DON'T LIKE IT AS MUCH
AS THAT OTHER THING YOU SAID.

423
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,242
[flute music]
- OH.

424
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,544
- HEY, HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?
WHERE YOU HEADED OFF TO?

425
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,246
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY
A FUN GAME WITH ME

426
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,680
THAT I MADE UP
CALLED CHESS-RISK?

427
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:50,683
IT'S HALF CHESS, HALF RISK AND
TAKES LIKE 15 HOURS TO PLAY.

428
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,285
- OKAY, YEAH, I THINK
I'M GONNA GO.

429
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,055
- I--OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT?

430
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,490
- OH, MY GOD!
- WHAT?

431
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,492
I FORGOT I HAVE A THING
I NEED TO SHOW YOU.

432
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,294
- OH.

433
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,096
- I NEED TO BRING YOU THERE
RIGHT NOW IT'S SO AMAZING.

434
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,597
IT'S GOING TO FREAK YOU OUT.

435
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,566
IT'S UH, IT'S SOMETHING
THAT WE NEED TO

436
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,336
GET IN MY CAR AND GO TO,
SO LET'S DO THAT.

437
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,370
- OKAY.
- COME ON.

438
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,172
- LESLIE,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

439
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,673
- I'M GOING TO THE THING
THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT WITH BEN.

440
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,108
NO SPOILERS, ANN.
SHE'S BEEN THERE BEFORE.

441
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,676
LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

442
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,045
[club music]

443
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,379
- WHAT'S UP, WHAT'S UP?

444
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,148
ARE YOU GUYS HAVING
A GOOD TIME TONIGHT?

445
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,582
[all cheering]

446
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,052
I THINK WE'VE GOTTA TAKE THINGS
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

447
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,186
DRUM LINE, HIT IT!

448
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:29,189
[drumbeat]

449
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:37,230
*

450
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,175
- WE'VE ALREADY BEEN
DOWN THIS STREET.

451
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,609
- JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

452
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,578
WHERE'S YOUR FAVORITE
PLACE TO GO LIKE EVER?

453
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,380
- [sighs]
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

454
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,148
TOM'S PARTY
SOUNDED KIND OF FUN.

455
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,549
- HERE WE ARE!
WE'RE AT THE SPECIAL PLACE!

456
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,618
[tires squeal]

457
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:03,390
WELL, HERE WE ARE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

458
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,692
- ARE YOU GONNA MURDER ME
AND BURY ME AT THIS GAS STATION?

459
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,095
- NO, THIS IS
A GREAT GAS STATION.

460
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:12,199
THIS GAS STATION
WAS OWNED BY...MICK JAGGER.

461
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,566
- UH-HUH.

462
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,834
- I CAME ACROSS
SOME FINANCIAL RECORDS

463
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,536
WHEN I WAS DOING
SOME RESEARCH FOR MY BOOK,

464
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,071
AND THIS GAS STATION WAS OWNED

465
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,540
BY AN M. JAGGER, WHICH AT FIRST
I THOUGHT WAS A WOMAN.

466
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,143
MAYBE MEG OR SOMETHING,
BUT I THINK

467
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,145
THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION

468
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:28,381
IS THAT LEGENDARY ROLLING STONES
FRONT MAN MICK JAGGER

469
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:31,584
OWNED THIS GAS STATION
FROM 1951 TO 1958.

470
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,486
- WHEN HE WAS EIGHT.

471
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,689
- YEAH, AND I JUST KNEW
YOU WERE A BIG FAN

472
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,858
OF, UM,
FINANCIAL RECORDS, SO...

473
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,560
YOU'RE WELCOME.

474
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:43,496
- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
LESLIE.

475
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,532
- I'M SHOWING YOU A PART
OF ROCK AND ROLL HISTORY.

476
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,468
- YOU--YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
YOU KNOW WE BROKE UP.

477
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,804
AND I KIND OF FEEL LIKE WE
SHOULDN'T...

478
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:55,175
HANG OUT TOGETHER,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

479
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,844
BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE DO,
IT JUST MAKES IT HARDER.

480
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,213
YOU KNOW?

481
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,581
- OKAY.

482
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,252
OKAY.

483
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,458
- THIS ONE
WOULD GET ME ARRESTED

484
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,560
AND THIS OTHER ONE'S
IMPOSSIBLE,

485
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,462
BECAUSE WE NEED EDDIE VEDDER
AND A TIME MACHINE.

486
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,330
I THINK WE'VE DONE
EVERYTHING ON THE LIST

487
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:18,465
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DO, SO...

488
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,733
- REALLY?
- YEAH, I MEAN...

489
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,336
I THINK THAT'S IT.
- WHAT ABOUT THIS?

490
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,605
- OH, MY GOD,
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

491
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,440
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
- NO, IT ISN'T.

492
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,476
WE HAVE $1,000
IN OUR BANK ACCOUNT,

493
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,710
AND WE'RE YOUNG
AND IRRESPONSIBLE.

494
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,146
- [laughs] I MEAN,
OUR CAR WOULD BREAK DOWN.

495
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,281
THERE'S NO WAY WE
COULD EVEN GET THERE.

496
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,583
- SO I'LL STEAL MY DAD'S CAR.

497
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,719
LOOK, THIS IS A STUPID IDEA,
BUT RIGHT AT THIS EXACT SECOND,

498
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,255
WE HAVE ENOUGH MOMENTUM
TO DO SOMETHING STUPID

499
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,423
BEFORE WE REALIZE
HOW STUPID IT IS.

500
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:48,495
- YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
NO THINKING, JUST STUPID.

501
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,297
- YES!

502
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,365
- BUDDHISTS FEEL
THAT HUMAN BEINGS

503
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55,268
ARE UNLIKELY TO BE
REINCARNATED AS HUMAN BEINGS.

504
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,537
SO THE PROBLEM
WITH REINCARNATION

505
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,706
IS THAT YOU COULD BE
REBORN AS A PRETZEL.

506
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,175
OR A SOCKET WRENCH.

507
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,610
RON, IF YOU COULD
BE REINCARNATED,

508
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,245
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE?

509
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,415
- SOCKET WRENCH SOUNDS
PRETTY GOOD, ACTUALLY.

510
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,717
- I THINK THE DANGER IN
BELIEVING IN REINCARNATION

511
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,919
IS THAT YOU SPEND SO MUCH
TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

512
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:13,920
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE
IN THE NEXT LIFETIME

513
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,290
THAT YOU FORGET TO ENJOY
THE ONE YOU'RE IN NOW.

514
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:21,394
- ANN PERKINS...
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

515
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:23,230
LET'S GO TO THAT PARTY
THAT TOM'S HAVING.

516
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,532
HAVE SOME FUN IN THIS LIFE.

517
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,900
- SOUNDS GOOD.

518
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,270
- WAIT.
I WANT TO CHANGE MY ANSWER.

519
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,839
I'LL GO WITH BOLT CUTTERS.

520
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,842

522
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:46,353
- MAYBE YOU'LL BE REINCARNATED
AS A GOOD DANCER.

523
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,988
- [laughs]
ANN PERKINS, YOU ZINGED ME!

524
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,223
I LOVE THAT!

525
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:53,893
*

526
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,396
- TOMMY, THIS IS THE BEST
PARTY I'VE EVER BEEN TO.

527
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,797
I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT.

528
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,233
- FOR REAL, T.T.,
THINK ABOUT IT, MAN.

529
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:03,303
DRUM LINES, PERSONALIZED
GIFT BAGS, TIGERS.

530
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,971
- IT'S PRETTY GREAT.

531
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,373
BUT IT'S NOT PERFECT.

532
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,874
I MEAN, DAVID BECKHAM
DIDN'T SHOW UP.

533
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,742
- YOU KNEW THAT WAS
A LONG SHOT.

534
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,611
HONESTLY, THIS IS PERFECT.

535
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,347
- I GUESS.
- TOM.

536
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,983
- HEY, LUCY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

537
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,651
- JEAN-RALPHIO CALLED ME
AND TOLD ME

538
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,387
THAT THIS WAS
A VERY SPECIAL OCCASION

539
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,888
AND I SHOULD COME DOWN.

540
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,290
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

541
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,757
- YEAH, GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

542
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,892
- WANT TO GO DANCE?

543
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,560
- YEAH, YEAH!
UH, GIVE ME A MINUTE.

544
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,996
- OKAY.

545
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,332
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CALLED HER FOR ME.

546
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,267
THAT'S REALLY NICE
OF YOU, MAN, FOR REAL.

547
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,568
THANKS.

548
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,337
- NO, NO, NO, THANK YOU.

549
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,640
I MEAN FOR EVERYTHING.

550
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:43,009
[sweeping noises]

551
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,646
I ACTUALLY FORGOT
THEY EVER DATED.

552
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,482
I WAS TRYING TO HIT THAT.

553
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,951
- DAWN IS NIGH!

554
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,021
ZORP THE SURVEYOR APPROACHES,

555
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:59,326
AND ALL EARTHLY DEBTS
WILL BE REPAID

556
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,762
TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE
OF LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE.

557
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:06,833
LAST CALL FOR DOUGHNUTS.

558
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:10,370
- WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THE WORLD
WAS REALLY GONNA END?

559
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:13,906
- I'D GO HOME.
DRINK SOME WHISKY.

560
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,409
THEN I'D GO SEE MY EX-WIVES.

561
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:19,078
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

562
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,047
I WANT TO WATCH THEM
MEET THEIR FIERY END

563
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,616
WITH MY OWN EYES.

564
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,619
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

565
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:29,456
- CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU
ABOUT A PERSONAL MATTER?

566
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,791
- NORMALLY, NO.

567
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,327
BUT...GIVEN THERE'S
ONLY 20 MINUTES

568
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,995
UNTIL THE END
OF HUMAN EXISTENCE...

569
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,597
ALSO, NO.

570
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,666
- I LOST MY MIND TONIGHT.

571
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:43,102
I TRIED TO SCREW UP
EVEN THE POTENTIAL OF BEN

572
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,437
DATING SOMEONE ELSE.

573
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,005
- DID YOU NOT HEAR ME
WHEN I SAID NO?

574
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,375
- OH, WE BROKE UP
BECAUSE OF ME.

575
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:52,044
BUT I HAVE TO
TELL YOU, RON...

576
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,416
IF THE WORLD
WAS ENDING TOMORROW,

577
00:21:56,449 --> 00:22:00,520
I'D WANT TO BE WITH HIM.

578
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:03,423
- WELL, THAT'S SIGNIFICANT.

579
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:07,427
PROBLEM IS, LESLIE, THE WORLD'S
NOT ENDING TOMORROW.

580
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,029
THE SUN'S GOING TO RISE
RIGHT OVER THERE.

581
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,632
IT'LL BE A REGULAR FRIDAY,

582
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,101
AND YOU'LL BE IN THE EXACT SAME
POSITION YOU WERE IN BEFORE.

583
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,604
- [sighs] I KNOW.

584
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:20,673
I MADE MY DECISION.
I NEED TO STICK TO IT.

585
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,141
IT'S JUST THE THOUGHT
OF HIM WITH SOMEONE ELSE

586
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,676
IS MAKING ME MISERABLE.

587
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,945
- IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER, LESLIE,

588
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,981
WE'LL ALL BE DEAD
IN 20 MINUTES.

589
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,684
- THAT DOES MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
THANK YOU, HERB.

590
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:34,120

LIKE A FRUIT BAT.

THIS CAR IS NICE!

594
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:53,873
HOW LONG YOU THINK
IT'LL TAKE US?

595
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,443
UH, THE MAP SAYS 30 HOURS
BUT I DRIVE REALLY FAST.

596
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,177
- 30 HOURS?
- MM-HMM.

597
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,712
- OH, CRAP!
I DIDN'T BRING ANY MUSIC.

598
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:00,813
- NO!

599
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:01,881
- DOES YOUR DAD
HAVE ANYTHING GOOD?

600

- EW! STARLIGHT EXPRESS,

- NEXT?
- BOBBY MCFERRIN?

604
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,493
- NO, WE CANNOT LISTEN
TO BOBBY MCFERRIN

605
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:14,761
FOR 60 HOURS OF DRIVING!

606
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:16,663
WE'LL MURDER EACH OTHER.

607
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,030
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

- OH.
- GRAD SCHOOL'S FUN,

625

BUT I DO MISS THIS TOWN.

00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:01,774
- YEAH.
- WHAT'S WRONG?

627
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,776
- I DON'T KNOW.

628
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,045
AFTER THIS IS DONE,
I'M GONNA BE BROKE,

HAVE A JOB.

AIMING FOR SOMETHING--

- THAT'S WHY I TOOK YOU

ABANDONED GAS STATION.

BECAUSE SHE THINKS YOU'RE
CUTE, AND I WAS AFRAID

YOU GUYS WERE GONNA
MAKE OUT AND HAVE BABIES,

643
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,984
AND I HAD NO RIGHT
TO DO THAT TO YOU

644

OR YOUR FUTURE CHILDREN.

00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,955
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL JUST NOW

646
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,090
THAT I REALIZED
THE ROMANTIC PART

647
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:54,060
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP IS OVER.

SHAUNA TO MAKE HERSELF DECENT

TO HER AS WELL.

THAN I COULD HAVE
EVER EVEN IMAGINED.

659
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,217
- YEAH.

660
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,654
I'M TRYING TO FIND A WAY
TO BE ANNOYED BY IT, BUT...

661
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,689
COMING UP EMPTY.

662
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,658
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

DONE THIS WITHOUT YOU.

LIKE THE PRESIDENTS.

- FRANKLY, LESLIE,
I'M SHOCKED.

667
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,246
ALL THE SCHOLARLY WORK
THAT I DID ON THESE TEXTS

668
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,082
INDICATED THAT
THE WORLD WOULD END.

669
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:25,184
- OH, GOSH, I'M AS DISAPPOINTED
AS YOU ARE, HERB.

670
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:27,353
- YEAH, BUT WHEN THE WORLD
DID NOT END,

671
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:30,890
I WENT HOME AND BEGAN
TO REEVALUATE THE TEXTS.

672
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,825
- YOU DON'T SAY.

673
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,795
- AND I REALIZED THAT
I'D MADE SOME CRUCIAL ERRORS

674

- WELL, MATH IS HARD.
