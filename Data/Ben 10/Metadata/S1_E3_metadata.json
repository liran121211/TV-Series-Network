Now Ben is hard-pressed to get anyone to believe him, but not for long.", "The Tennysons camp by a lake that - wouldn't you know it? - has a monster in it (a true behemoth), but only Ben has seen it. Having recently dressed up as a sea monster to scare Gwen, he's now taken for a boy who's taking a joke too far. Only the creepy Captain Shaw believes there's a monster in the water, but he's not the sterling character needed to help Ben regain his good word; however, when the monster later makes a very public appearance, Ben's word is restored and he's off to join the captain for a monster hunt, much against Grandpa Max's instructions.\u2014statmanjeff"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0803913", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 888, "number_of_episodes": 52}
