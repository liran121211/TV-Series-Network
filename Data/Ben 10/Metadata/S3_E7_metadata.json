    "While visiting the Planetary Studios theme park, Ben hopes to meet his favorite live-action TV hero, Kangaroo Commando, but he's both incensed and distracted by illustrator Tim Dean, who has ripped off the likenesses of Wildmutt, Four Arms and Heatblast and passed them off as his own cartoon creations.
