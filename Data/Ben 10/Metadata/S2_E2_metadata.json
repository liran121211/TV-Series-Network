As he tries to figure out the alien's abilities, a meteor crashes nearby. A giant tick emerges. It's already destroyed several other planets. Now Earth is next.", "In Yellowstone Nation Park, Ben would rather run out for a hamburger than live off the land with Grandpa Max, but in trying to call forth XLR8, he instead gets a new and unwanted alien transformation, a roly poly alien that has trouble simply standing. Just then, a meteor strikes nearby, but it quickly proves to be a giant alien parasite ready to suck dry Earth's vitality. Three aliens follow, all of differing species, to worship this bug as it feeds.
