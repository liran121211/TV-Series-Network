It comes in handy now that Vilgax and Kevin 11 are teamed up and coming for him.", "Still messing around with the Omnitrix, Ben hits upon the master code that allows him to transform into any of the aliens at will. Heady with delight, Ben transforms into whatever he wants, whenever he wants and for as long as he wants (basically to do anything he wants despite Gwen an Grandpa Max warning him to go easy). Meanwhile, in outer space, Kevin 11 has sought out and awakened Vilgax to form an uneasy alliance under their mutual and consuming hatred of Ben. They easily find Ben through his overuse of the Omnitrix, and a two-on-one battle for the watch begins. Grandpa Max finally sends Kevin and Vilgax to the Null-Void (an alternate dimension where the baddest of the bad are banished), but Ben, always thinking he knows better, jumps forward and gets sucked through the portal with them. With Ben trapped in a hostile environment, Gwen and Max work to free him, but eventually Ben must make a pretty hefty sacrifice.\u2014statmanjeff"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0879431", "rating": 9.1, "votes": 921, "number_of_episodes": 52}
