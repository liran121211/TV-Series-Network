    "Ben is enthralled as a team of galactic superheroes trail two supervillains to Earth who are looking for the other chemical half of a solar-system-destroying explosive.",
    "Six Six and his able henchman Vulcanus come to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to gain the other ingredient half of a solar-system-annihilating explosive. Close on their heels are Ultimos, Synaptak and Tini - the Galactic Enforces. Ben is in caped-superhero heaven. Due to his possession of the Omnitrix. he's recognized as their equal and granted full peer privileges, inflating his already over-large sense of entitlement. Gwen and Grandpa Max, however, find themselves treated no better than as cargo - not even sidekick status - for which Ben takes no notice. The Enforcers' main flaw, though, is their adherence of fairness and protocol as dictated by their idealistic and extensive Galactic Code of Conduct, which the supervillains evidently don't share.\u2014statmanjeff"
