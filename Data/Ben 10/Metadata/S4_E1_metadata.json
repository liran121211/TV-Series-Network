Ditto can replicate himself many times over but with two drawbacks. First, injury to one will be felt by all. Second, Ben can't become Ben again unless all the Dittos are together. This sort of comes in handy when Dr. Animo, freshly escaped from prison, arrives with a giant seagull mutation to capture Ben and add his alien gene pools to Animo's transmutation matrix.\u2014statmanjeff"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1072776", "rating": 7.6, "votes": 609, "number_of_episodes": 52}
