As a birthday gift, Ben gives Ken an Omnitrix, with ten aliens. Ken soon befriends Devlin, a youth with some ties to an archenemy of Ben's.", "In the future, Ben 10,000's son Ken turns ten (a lad just as willful and self-centered as his father at that age). As a present, he gets his own Omnitrix but chafes at only getting ten alien heroes from which to choose. He accepts it nonetheless. While joyriding on his hoverboard, he meets and befriends another youth his age, unaware he's Devlin, son of Ben's archenemy Kevin. Devlin's plan: worm his way into Ken's trust and free his dad from the Null Void. Ken, unfortunately, is just the right kind of arrogant dupe to fall perfectly into this plan.\u2014statmanjeff"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1127383", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 672, "number_of_episodes": 52}
