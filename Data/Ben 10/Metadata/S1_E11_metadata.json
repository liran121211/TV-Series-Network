An alien enthusiast captures Grey Matter and wants to announce it to the world, so he contacts The Organization, which wants the alien for its own plans.", "Ben's penchant for using the Omnitrix for personal gain lands him in trouble again (but in part due to the Omnitrix behaving unreliably). Transforming at a water park to enjoy a height-restricted slide, Ben, to his chagrin, ends up as the diminutive Gray Matter, and just as Howell, an alien fanatic, comes along. Excited by \"proof\" of aliens on Earth, Howell grabs Gray Matter and, anticipating fame, notoriety and respect, contacts The Organization, a secret society bent on laying hands to all the alien artifacts it can get, but its reactions aren't what Howell expects or what Ben can live with.\u2014statmanjeff"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0803904", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 758, "number_of_episodes": 52}
