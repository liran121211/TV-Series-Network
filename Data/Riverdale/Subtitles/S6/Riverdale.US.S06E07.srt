1
00:00:05,657 --> 00:00:07,442
Everything has shifted.

2
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:09,139
There was an explosion
at Archie's house

3
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:10,706
and I lost my ability to hear.

4
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,145
Some things
I could do as before.

5
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,408
Read, eat hamburgers,
kiss Tabitha.

6
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:20,107
But there are other things

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,631
that I may never be able
to do again.

8
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:24,720
The fact of the matter is,
my world shattered.

9
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:32,032
The question now was
how do I rebuild?

10
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:33,468
All right, guys, listen up.

11
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:34,773
Frank and I have reinforced

12
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:36,055
the infrastructure of the house,

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,341
so it's safe to work.

14
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:39,169
But please,
keep your helmets on.

15
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:41,345
Let's have
a good productive shift, okay?

16
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:45,306
So much for your safety meeting.

17
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:46,698
Keep going.

18
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:47,960
I'm already going.

19
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:49,962
Well, go harder.

20
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:53,488
I'm pressing as hard as I can.

21
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:56,099
My God.
You don't feel it at all?

22
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:58,101
No. Nothing.

23
00:00:58,145 --> 00:00:59,145
Not one bit.

24
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,540
Okay, well, it's confirmed.

25
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:04,716
You're still invulnerable.

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,043
Well, Betty, I don't know what
happened to us in that explosion,

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,939
but all of my childhood dreams
about becoming a superhero

28
00:01:09,982 --> 00:01:12,550
are somehow... coming true.

29
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:14,857
Mmm-hmm.

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,033
Have you talked to Jughead
about any of this?

31
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,817
He was third closest
to the explosion.

32
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:20,906
Fourth closest.
Don't forget Bingo.

33
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,908
Who's driving my mother crazy.

34
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:25,128
No. Yeah, I just left Jughead
a couple of messages.

35
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:26,173
He hasn't answered me.

36
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:27,304
I'll check up on him.

37
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:29,393
A little later.

38
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:31,091
Okay.

39
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,138
Grand Mistress Rose.

40
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,401
I just had
the strangest encounter

41
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:38,968
with Master Cheryl upstairs.

42
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:42,102
She seemed...
less like herself than usual.

43
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:47,368
That's because I transferred
Abigail's soul from your body

44
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:51,502
into my granddaughter's,
via an arcane ritual.

45
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:53,722
But where did
Mistress Cheryl's soul go?

46
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:57,726
Oh, once untethered,
it dissipated into the ether.

47
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:00,859
Into nothingness.

48
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:04,080
There is no more Cheryl Blossom.

49
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,866
There is only...

50
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,129
Abigail.

51
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:16,092
Roseanne, do all the ladies
dress like harlots these days?

52
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,443
Indeed, we live in fallen times.

53
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:22,664
That is why
I brought you back, Abigail.

54
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:24,318
To lift us up.

55
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:28,235
To restore the Blossom family
to our former glory.

56
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:31,107
And how, pray tell,
am I meant to do that?

57
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,415
Riverdale once belonged
to the Blossoms.

58
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:40,160
I think it's time
we took it back, don't you?

59
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:41,770
Of course.

60
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:44,860
I should like to get
a lay of the land first.

61
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:48,298
Well, the town is governed,
inaptly I might add,

62
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:50,170
by a Council of Four.

63
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,389
We'll start there.

64
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:03,139
Archie just found out
that I lost my ability to hear.

65
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,663
Then he asked me
a curious question.

66
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:09,252
He wants to know if anything
weird happened to me

67
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:10,929
after the explosion.

68
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:14,237
"You mean beside
losing my hearing?", I say.

69
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,196
"Why do you ask?"

70
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,458
"Just curious", he says.

71
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,896
I'm not sure I believe him.

72
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,167
Reggie, I need
to tell you something.

73
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,126
Okay.

74
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,261
Three days ago,
my father's body was found

75
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:41,264
in a shallow grave
in the New Jersey Pine Barrens.

76
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:43,048
What? How'd he die?

77
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:46,269
His hands were zip-tied,

78
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:50,317
and he'd been shot four times
in the back of the head.

79
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,232
His body was then burned.

80
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,320
Could it be a fake-out?

81
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:54,363
No, Reggie.

82
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:58,281
He's dead.

83
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,543
I'm sure he's dead.

84
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,767
Wait. You lied to me.

85
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,900
You told me
you called off the hit.

86
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:10,598
I... I didn't want to
be judged.

87
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:12,861
In what universe.
Am I not supposed to judge you?

88
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,341
Well...

89
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:16,081
Brace yourself
because there's more.

90
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:19,868
We are hosting
a memorial service

91
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:22,000
for my father
right here at the casino.

92
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:23,741
My grandmother is coming.

93
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:26,222
Some of my father's associates,
my mom.

94
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,765
Does your mom and grandma
know the truth?

95
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:28,877
No.

96
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,708
I may tell my mom, but...

97
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:35,971
Not Abuelita.
She'd never forgive me.

98
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:39,235
Copy. So, should I...

99
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,368
say I'm sorry for your loss
or congratulations?

100
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,851
I don't know, Reggie.

101
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,769
I just don't know.

102
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,336
The long and short of it is

103
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,599
I'm staying to take care
of Baby Anthony.

104
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:58,341
And I was... I was thinking,

105
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:01,257
if I'm gonna be in town
for a while longer...

106
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,279
Maybe I'll take you up on
your offer to be your deputy.

107
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,348
I'd love that.

108
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,804
You sure that's something
that you want to do?

109
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:09,396
Yeah, I do.

110
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,050
Well, in that case,
I would be honored.

111
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:13,400
Yeah.

112
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:14,843
All right. Thanks, Dad.
Hey, cheers.

113
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:16,794
To my new deputy.

114
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,581
Poor Jug.

115
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:22,147
Yeah.

116
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:23,627
Well, at least he's got Tabitha.

117
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,198
- Hello.
- Agent Cooper.

118
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,895
I wanted to let you know ASAP.

119
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,028
Glen's car was found
outside Pop's diner.

120
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:34,638
And where's Glen?

121
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:36,379
No one's heard from him

122
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,223
since he was supposed to
be leaving Riverdale.

123
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,864
Okay. Thanks
for letting me know, Agent Lin.

124
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:43,907
I'll be in soon.

125
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,782
That's weird.

126
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:49,958
Glen's MIA.

127
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:52,264
Abuelita.
How are you holding up?

128
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,964
What a tragedy upon your papa.

129
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,922
I know it's awful.

130
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,924
Your father and his business.

131
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,622
I knew it would end up this way.

132
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,928
In bloodshed, one dark night.

133
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:08,846
Veronica, I would like to

134
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,762
introduce you to Heraldo,
my godson.

135
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,155
He takes good care of me.

136
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:14,374
Nice to meet you, Heraldo.

137
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,897
Pleased to meet you.

138
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,638
Abuelita, I'd like you to meet

139
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:22,773
my business partner and...
boyfriend, Reginald Mantle.

140
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:24,601
It's a pleasure
and an honor, ma'am.

141
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,040
It's very good to meet you.

142
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:30,215
Can I give this to you?

143
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,579
It's a guest list
for the funeral.

144
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:35,351
Is there anything else
you want me to do?

145
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,659
Si, your abuelitahas requested
that you deliver the eulogy.

146
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:40,356
No. I...

147
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,098
I wouldn't know what to say.

148
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:46,231
Who will be better
than you, Nieta?

149
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:47,929
Your papiloved you so much.

150
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:51,585
Please, do this for me.

151
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:00,942
I told Tabitha
what the ENT doctor said,

152
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:02,726
that I had to wait
at least six months

153
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,336
before getting an implant.

154
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,426
Then she asked me
about learning ASL.

155
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:09,080
I told her I wouldn't need ASL
once I got the implants.

156
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,607
Then she asked me
if I wrote today.

157
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,218
I told her that I always
listen to music when I write,

158
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:19,134
and when I tried to write
without it today, I just...

159
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:22,137
I couldn't hear the clack
of my keyboard's keys.

160
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,574
Everything about writing
suddenly became alien to me.

161
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,186
I told her
there's nothing she could do,

162
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,667
that somehow we just have to
get through this.

163
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,683
Everything all right,
Agent Cooper?

164
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:48,032
Yeah, I'm fine.

165
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,034
Just have, like,
a brutal headache

166
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:51,471
directly behind my eyes.

167
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:54,124
Sounds like a migraine.

168
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:58,390
I've never had migraines before.

169
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:00,175
Also this came for you today.

170
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:01,219
Thank you.

171
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:32,990
Now we'd like
to open up the floor

172
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,123
to all members of the community.

173
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,604
Oh.

174
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:40,563
Why, that must be some relation
to Archibald Andrews.

175
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:41,888
Can I get an extension
on the permit

176
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:42,976
for the dumpsters
in front of house?

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,307
Permission granted, Archie.

178
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:47,439
Uh, who's next?

179
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:49,267
I have an announcement.

180
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:56,231
My father, Hiram Lodge...
is dead.

181
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:02,890
He died under mysterious,
violent circumstances.

182
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:03,847
I'm fine.

183
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:06,067
But please rejoice.

184
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,113
Riverdale's Big Bad will be
tormenting us no longer.

185
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:14,379
Any other announcements?

186
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,383
Hello.

187
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:20,081
Uh, my name is Percival Pickens.

188
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:21,517
I recently moved to Riverdale,

189
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,519
and I just wanted you all
to know...

190
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,653
how excited I am

191
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,176
to be joining your community.

192
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,613
Pickens.

193
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:32,572
In the earliest of early days,

194
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:33,921
did we Blossoms not have

195
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,662
a fellowship
with the Pickens family?

196
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:38,839
Yes. And it did not end well.

197
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:41,232
Welcome, Percival.

198
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:45,193
By any chance, are you related
to General Augustus Pickens?

199
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:46,586
Oh.

200
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,196
Goodness. Yes, but, uh,
don't worry.

201
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,677
I'm... I'm not here
to cause trouble.

202
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,157
I simply believe that
with a little bit of luck

203
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:54,637
and some hard work,

204
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:56,639
Riverdale could become
one of the greatest

205
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:59,294
and most-prosperous communities
in America.

206
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:00,904
Now, I have lots of ideas

207
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:02,514
I'd be happy to share
with the council.

208
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:05,039
Starting with the removal...

209
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:07,432
Sorry. So sorry I'm late.

210
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:11,828
I was busy trying to stop

211
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:13,569
a gang war from erupting
on the streets,

212
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,266
but what else is new, right?

213
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,747
Why, that is the spitting image
of my beloved Thomasina.

214
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,445
That's Miss Topaz. Toni Topaz.

215
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,404
Topaz?

216
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:25,363
That was my paramour's surname.

217
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,584
You must tell me everything
about this Toni Topaz.

218
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,812
Tabitha was
at a town hall meeting.

219
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,684
I didn't go.
I couldn't face people's pity.

220
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:43,643
So I stayed home
and tried to write,

221
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:46,384
but again, nothing came to me.

222
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:57,178
And then... suddenly I knew
exactly what I wanted to do.

223
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,963
Hey, how you doin'? Really.

224
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:03,010
I'm okay.

225
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,751
I mean, after all,
it wasn't too long ago

226
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:08,580
you and I were in your car
plotting to take Daddy out

227
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:10,844
in a similarly gruesome manner.

228
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:13,585
We were angry.

229
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:16,023
It's not like we actually would
have gone through with it.

230
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,941
I guess we'll never know.

231
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,333
All right, Britannia.

232
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,684
Wherefore does this Toni
spent her days?

233
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,034
Miss Topaz
works at Riverdale High.

234
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,731
She's our guidance counselor

235
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,342
and she teaches
the history of social justice.

236
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:34,606
Fittingly, yes. Thomasina was
a teacher as well.

237
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,826
And this Riverdale High,

238
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,393
- that's a school?
- Exactly.

239
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,570
You will take me there tomorrow.

240
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:46,053
And you, little lamb,
will be my Trojan horse.

241
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:49,926
But tell me, why were Tony
and Cheryl torn asunder?

242
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,146
To be honest, I don't know.

243
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:55,889
And they were together
as two women out in the open?

244
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:57,673
Yes.

245
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,633
What a brave new world this is.

246
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,247
This is insane, Betty.

247
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,771
Now TBK is in Riverdale
and he murdered Glen.

248
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:10,294
No, I don't think
he killed Glen.

249
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:12,775
I think he's keeping him
alive somewhere.

250
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,691
Dismembering him piece by piece.

251
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,258
What makes you think that?

252
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,141
Because that's his
preferred method of killing.

253
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:20,522
Slowly.

254
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:22,872
So it takes days, if not weeks,

255
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,135
so they suffer.

256
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,983
But you don't think
he's going to come after you?

257
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,358
I don't know. But if he does,
even without a mask,

258
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:34,318
I should be able to see
his aura if it's a threat,

259
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:36,407
like I did with Glen
and the orderly right?

260
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:39,149
I'm more worried about
everyone else in Riverdale.

261
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:41,325
I'll have my mom
spread the word on RIVW.

262
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,632
And I'll have my team
out on the streets

263
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:44,835
canvassing the neighborhoods.

264
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:51,379
I couldn't hear
what Tabitha was saying,

265
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:53,468
but I knew she was pissed at me,

266
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,296
as well as she should have been.

267
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,385
I took my motorcycle
out for a ride.

268
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:59,691
Sure enough, I wiped out.

269
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:04,827
But how could I tell Tabitha
that for those brief moments

270
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:08,570
when I was cruising,
all was right in the world?

271
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:11,181
We're getting the word out
through local media and social,

272
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,749
but more than 50%
of TBK's victims

273
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,795
are from
historically disenfranchised

274
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,797
vulnerable communities.

275
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,364
He preys on the unhoused
because no one misses them.

276
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:21,801
So we're gonna focus on

277
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,151
those neighborhoods
with these flyers.

278
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:25,761
To anyone
you come in contact with,

279
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,459
tell them if they see TBK,
do not approach him.

280
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,897
Call us
and we'll take it from there.

281
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,246
I'll hit Sketch Alley,

282
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:33,569
Agent Lin's
got your assignments.

283
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,859
Okay. You're gonna
come with me...

284
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:40,863
- Veronica Lodge?
- Yes. How can I help you?

285
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:42,865
This is a release that states
you're okay with us

286
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,998
filming you and using
your likeness on television.

287
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,391
Oh, right. Sure.

288
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:51,046
All right.

289
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,311
Oh. Okay.

290
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,836
Okay. If you can just
take a step towards me,

291
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,489
find your light.

292
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:00,187
Perfect.

293
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,753
All right, let's bring her in.

294
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:04,017
Baby.

295
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,454
Oh. It's okay.

296
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:07,455
I'm here. Let it out.

297
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,152
Mommy is here.

298
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:11,372
Hi, Mom.

299
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,817
Hey, boss.

300
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,781
Found this while I was
clearing out the basement.

301
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:26,691
Holy crap.

302
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,366
You know what this is, right?

303
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,608
No.

304
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:31,740
Palladium.

305
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,350
I got to keep a couple pieces

306
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:35,234
after I did all that mining
for Cheryl Blossom.

307
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,920
It's worth
a hefty chunk of change.

308
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,096
Hey, as a reward for finding it,

309
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,141
I'll split it with you.

310
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:43,621
No, I couldn't. It's yours.

311
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:45,710
I'll tell you what.
If you find the other piece,

312
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:46,929
you can keep that one.

313
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,148
Break time, people.

314
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,758
Alice has coffee brewing
next door.

315
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,633
Freshly brewed coffee.

316
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,768
Bingo, down.
Get down, get down.

317
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,684
Oh.

318
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,686
Archie, how the hell
are you drinking that?

319
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:05,817
Isn't that too hot?

320
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:11,823
Yeah, yeah. Yes, it's hot.

321
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,651
It's really hot.

322
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,697
So talk to me, Cheryl.

323
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,004
You said that you need
some help with Britta.

324
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,006
I would like to
formally adopt her.

325
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,703
Well, great.

326
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:22,922
Um, but, Cheryl...

327
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,054
there's a bunch of hoops

328
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,012
we're going to have to
jump through.

329
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:28,057
Well, Antoinette,

330
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,190
why don't you come by
Thornhill this eventide

331
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,496
and walk me through those steps?

332
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,977
Slowly and methodically.

333
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,651
Actually, I'm going to
be bartending

334
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,373
at the Whyte Wyrm tonight.

335
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,765
In that case,

336
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,072
perchance I will pay you
a visit instead.

337
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:49,949
By the way, thank you so much
for inviting me, Hermione.

338
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,472
Oh, not at all, Kevin.

339
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:52,995
I know you're a super fan.

340
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,824
And this is going to be
an extra special episode

341
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:57,304
of reality television.

342
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:59,219
All about how Veronica and I
are dealing

343
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:01,699
with the emotional fallout
of Hiram's tragic death.

344
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:03,527
Wait, is that what
we're doing here?

345
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:06,704
Don't worry, honey.
I'll guide you through it.

346
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,489
Do you remember where you were

347
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:12,101
when you first heard the news
of Hiram's tragic death?

348
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,451
Mom, I'm not gonna
reduce my feelings

349
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:15,757
to sound bites for your show.

350
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,150
How did you feel
when Daddy died?

351
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:19,326
- Did you cry?
- Nope.

352
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:22,894
Because the man I loved
died many years ago.

353
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:26,463
I cried when I mourned
the death of my marriage.

354
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:31,338
But I am through shedding tears
for that man.

355
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:36,169
All right. Kevin, Abuelita,
Heraldo, camera crew,

356
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:37,909
please clear the room.

357
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,737
I need to talk to my mom.

358
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:41,087
Alone.

359
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:47,006
Veronica,
what is it, sweetheart?

360
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:52,446
It was me.

361
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:54,361
I put it bounty on Daddy's head.

362
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:56,624
I'm the reason he died.

363
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:00,409
You know what...

364
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,197
I sort of suspected.

365
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,068
When I heard
how your father was found,

366
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,157
I thought,
"What if Veronica was the one

367
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:09,637
who finally did it?"

368
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,595
- His favorite partner.
- What do you mean?

369
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:15,382
I don't like admitting this,
but...

370
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:20,082
Sometimes I was
a little jealous of you two.

371
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,258
I mean, the special
relationship that you two had?

372
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:25,174
I always knew that he loved you
more than he loved me.

373
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:28,221
I just... I was afraid that
the same was true of you.

374
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,745
You loved him
more than you loved me.

375
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:32,094
No.

376
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,444
After all he did,
Daddy infuriated me.

377
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:37,360
Exactly. And he had all of
your attention because of it.

378
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:39,406
Do you know that the happiest
I ever was

379
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:41,079
was when it was just us
living in this apartment?

380
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,497
Just us Lodge women
together against the world.

381
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:47,762
And then your father came home,

382
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:51,026
and it was Hiram
and his best girl.

383
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,375
That was you, Veronica.

384
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:57,076
Not me. Never me.

385
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,993
I'm so sorry, Mom.

386
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:04,387
I was so caught up in
drama with Daddy

387
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:06,259
that I wasn't a good daughter
to you.

388
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:10,437
But I want to be one now.

389
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,788
Honey...

390
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,485
I can't tell you how happy
it makes me

391
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,529
to hear you say that.

392
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:19,620
There's nothing I want more.

393
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,963
Tabitha found him.

394
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:02,706
Like me, Daniel experienced
late-life deafness.

395
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,145
He learned a sign and read lips
in his 20s.

396
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,191
Now he helps people
on journeys similar to his own.

397
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,410
He wanted to help me.

398
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,114
I nodded "yes,"

399
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,769
and we made an appointment
for me to go to his office.

400
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:35,478
Hello, pretty Betty.

401
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,961
Working late, I see.

402
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:41,702
How did you get in here?

403
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,182
Glen's access card.

404
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:47,360
Glen. Is he still...

405
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:51,102
Yes. He's proven
extremely hardy.

406
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:53,931
Why are you here?

407
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,455
I came after reading

408
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:58,371
you were nearly killed
in an explosion.

409
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:03,376
You and Archie
are getting close.

410
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,248
Don't make me go after him next.

411
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:10,731
Try it. He'll kick your ass.
And so will I.

412
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:12,080
Get out of here.

413
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:13,603
Oh.

414
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,476
Betty, I've missed this.

415
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,087
Oh.

416
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:27,313
It's a tad tart.

417
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:28,756
Might I have
some more butter in it?

418
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:31,230
I don't have any butter, Cheryl.

419
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,970
And since when do you
drink beer, anyways?

420
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,668
Quite right.

421
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,105
And in truth,
I didn't come to drink.

422
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,978
Lately, I've been thinking
about the past.

423
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:44,765
My past, this town's past...

424
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:49,639
- Your past.
- My past? What about it?

425
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:52,512
How much do you know
about your ancestor, Thomasina?

426
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:55,210
She was a great, great aunt
of mine.

427
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,865
And, from what I can remember,
a spinster schoolmarm...

428
00:20:57,908 --> 00:20:59,823
That is falsehood.

429
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,869
Thomasina lived
her life passionately

430
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:04,088
and drank deeply
from the juices of the world.

431
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,396
Until she was murdered
by a warlock-pirate.

432
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,269
What are you talking about?

433
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,140
There's no such thing
as warlock-pirates.

434
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,837
Hey, Cheryl.

435
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:15,143
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

436
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,455
Oh, I'm... sorry, Cheryl.

437
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:24,108
We told Kevin,
but we just haven't

438
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:25,458
got around to telling you yet.

439
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:27,764
Fangs and I are together now.

440
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:30,245
Together?

441
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,901
And how did that... transpire?

442
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:36,469
We've known each other
since we were kids.

443
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,471
And after having
a baby together...

444
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:39,514
A baby?

445
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:43,040
Yeah. Baby Anthony, our son.

446
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,826
Of course.

447
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:48,655
And quite the cherub he is.

448
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:51,484
I have to get back
to fair Britannia.

449
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,877
A mother's work is never done,
after all.

450
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,752
What was that about?

451
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:01,450
I have no idea.

452
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:04,932
But Cheryl doesn't even seem
like Cheryl to me.

453
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,499
I can't believe
TBK came to see you

454
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:07,891
at the FBI office.

455
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:09,347
But what's scaring me
most right now is

456
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,025
I couldn't see his aura.

457
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:14,376
How could he not be
a threat to me?

458
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,597
Unless he's in
my blind spot somehow?

459
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,555
I don't know.

460
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,557
I keep getting
these headaches, too.

461
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:24,517
It feels like someone's
taking a pickaxe to my brain.

462
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,694
Something has been
happening to me, too.

463
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:29,739
I fell through
the landing earlier.

464
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:33,787
And... I got hurt, Betty.

465
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,266
Like, my invulnerability
is fading.

466
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,572
But what's changed?

467
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:40,228
TBK might be my blind spot,

468
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:42,448
but what's
your weakness, Superman?

469
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:44,667
What's your kryptonite?

470
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:47,366
Oh, my God.

471
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:51,848
One of my guys
found this piece of palladium,

472
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:53,565
and I've been carrying it
on me ever since.

473
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:55,461
What if this is my kryptonite?

474
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:00,161
- You take it.
- Okay.

475
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:01,902
Keep it away from me.

476
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:03,445
Let's see what happens
if it's not near me.

477
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,688
Maybe I'll go back
to being indestructible

478
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:07,603
Either way,

479
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:10,389
you really need to be
super careful right now, Arch.

480
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:13,783
TBK is a jealous serial killer.

481
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,916
You don't need to be a hero
right now.

482
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:19,049
At least not until your...
powers come back.

483
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:31,671
So I went to Daniel's office.

484
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:33,257
I told him that
one of my biggest worries

485
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,065
was that I'd never write again,

486
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,067
and he said that I should sit
in his office alone

487
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:40,419
for five hours, and to just
start writing down my thoughts,

488
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,622
that it would help me get
comfortable with the silence.

489
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:44,684
I said I'd do my best,

490
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:46,599
and then he left me alone.

491
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:52,474
- Wow, Mom, you really went all out.
- Mmm-mmm.

492
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,781
Is this food I can
actually eat or are we filming?

493
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:57,479
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

494
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:59,438
How would you feel about

495
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,223
recreating a version
of our conversation

496
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:04,225
that we had last night
on camera today?

497
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:06,377
I mean, not the part about you
killing your father, of course.

498
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:08,403
But the emotional part,

499
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,752
you know, our core wound

500
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:12,494
about you...
taking me for granted.

501
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,801
But, Mom, I...

502
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:17,238
I mean, all of that
was real for me.

503
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:19,022
That's why I want it on camera.

504
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,851
It was just so raw.
What do you think?

505
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:26,900
- Of course.
- Oh.

506
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:28,118
- Let's do it.
- Really?

507
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:29,162
Yeah.

508
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,990
Wonderful.

509
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,217
Mistress Abigail,
are you all right?

510
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:42,742
No, Britannia.
Clearly I am not all right.

511
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:44,918
I cannot fathom
that my beloved Thomasina

512
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:47,398
is in love
with a descendant of...

513
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:50,663
Fenn Fogarty.
Her very murderer.

514
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:54,710
I'm positively bereft.

515
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:57,670
Miss Topaz is dating
Fangs Fogarty?

516
00:24:57,713 --> 00:25:00,673
Well, I, for one, am relieved.

517
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:05,112
I reincarnated you to get back
what is ours.

518
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,592
Riverdale.

519
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:10,291
Not so you can consort
with some Serpent trash.

520
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:19,735
Did you just refer
to my beloved Thomasina

521
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:21,389
as "Serpent trash"?

522
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:23,217
I did.

523
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,267
You forget yourself, old woman.

524
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:32,531
But don't worry.

525
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,358
Abigail is here to remind you.

526
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,668
I will have Riverdale
back in my thrall.

527
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:43,542
I will have my revenge
on the offspring of my enemies.

528
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,587
But first...

529
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:48,068
I will have Thomasina back
by my side.

530
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:52,855
And death to anyone
who stands in my way.

531
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:12,440
Five hours later,
Daniel came back.

532
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:16,270
I hadn't written a word.

533
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:20,100
"It takes time," he said,
without any trace of judgment.

534
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:26,976
And then he gave me
a graphic novel to read.

535
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,023
One he'd written and drawn
about his experiences

536
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:32,721
navigating deafness.
He said it might help me.

537
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:35,550
I said I would read it.

538
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:39,772
Good evening, Miss Lodge.

539
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:42,992
Did I startle you?

540
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,472
Anatol, what the hell
do you want?

541
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:45,691
I paid you your blood money.

542
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:47,388
Yes, you did.

543
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:50,260
But I'm here on another job.

544
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:52,306
What, to kill me?

545
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:54,743
Right before
my father's funeral? Seriously?

546
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,399
You American women.

547
00:26:58,442 --> 00:26:59,966
You think you're so tough,

548
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:01,532
but you don't have
the slightest idea

549
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:02,576
of what you're doing.

550
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,275
And in the end,

551
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,191
you just turn on each other
like rats and kill each other.

552
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:09,758
Wait, who hired you?

553
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:10,890
Was it...

554
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:28,995
I'll clean up the body at night
and dispose of it tomorrow.

555
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,300
Who sent the Russian, you think?

556
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:31,824
If I had to guess...

557
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:35,349
my sister Hermosa.

558
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:38,232
She's pretty pissed at me,
I think.

559
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:39,745
For ordering
the hit on your father?

560
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:44,010
Wait, you know about that?

561
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:45,402
Oh, my God, does Abuelitaknow?

562
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:46,926
No, she doesn't.

563
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:49,624
Look, I make it my business

564
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,540
to know about everything
that happens in this family.

565
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:55,238
And I make sure none of it
touches your abuelita.

566
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:58,459
How do you do what you do
and then...

567
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:04,204
sit down to dinner with
Abuelitalike nothing happened?

568
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:05,945
Are you just
a really good actor?

569
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:09,165
Yes, but...

570
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:11,569
it also helps that I don't see
the world in black and white.

571
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:14,344
It's all just shades of gray.

572
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,740
No person is just one thing.

573
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:10,792
When Tabitha
came home from Pop's,

574
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:14,013
I surprised her by showing her
the pages I'd written that day.

575
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,537
I explained that Daniel's
graphic novel had been the key.

576
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,018
I used to write
by hearing words, auditory.

577
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:21,281
But Daniel's graphic novel
showed me a workaround.

578
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:23,109
I could write
from a visual space,

579
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:25,938
seeing words and actions,
then describing them.

580
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:37,601
And then I kissed her
for not giving up on me.

581
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:41,518
For never giving up on me.

582
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:42,911
Dennis, what's going on?

583
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:45,087
Hey, guess what I found.

584
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,004
Holy crap.

585
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:50,155
You must have done some digging.

586
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:51,180
Where do you find this?

587
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:09,416
- Hello.
- Agent Cooper.

588
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:11,263
I'm calling the number
you listed on those flyers.

589
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:13,607
I think the Trash Bag Killer
is at the end of Sketch Alley.

590
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:14,769
I'm on my way.

591
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,257
He's down there,
at the end of the alley.

592
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,475
Keep everyone back.

593
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,004
Hey! Put your hands up!

594
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:34,701
On your knees.

595
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:38,097
Don't move.

596
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,968
Please don't shoot me.

597
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:41,274
Take off your mask.

598
00:30:44,538 --> 00:30:46,105
I'm not TBK, I'm just a guy.

599
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:47,454
Who gave you that mask?

600
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:49,064
Some man who came by earlier.

601
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:50,781
He gave me 50 bucks
and told me to wear the mask

602
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:51,913
and to deliver a message
to a blonde woman

603
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:52,937
when she showed up.

604
00:30:55,157 --> 00:30:56,202
What's the message?

605
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,858
"Check the trash cans," he said.

606
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:18,093
Glen.

607
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:35,023
Thank you all for being here.

608
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:40,986
I won't stand here and wax
sentimental about my father.

609
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:43,466
He did horrible,
unspeakable things

610
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,425
to my mother, to my sister,

611
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:48,123
to my lover at the time,
Archie Andrews,

612
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:51,126
to my friends, to this town.

613
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,041
And to me.

614
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:02,224
But I'm also making room for
the fact that, on occasion...

615
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:07,186
He did a few
not-so-horrible things, too

616
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:11,538
He was a proud state champion
wrestler for Riverdale High.

617
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:14,497
He donated money to
the research of rare diseases.

618
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:17,109
He covered the funeral expense
of Fred Andrews,

619
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,459
with whom he did not see
eye to eye,

620
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:21,287
without hesitation.

621
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,854
And he was a dutiful son
to my abuelita.

622
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:26,335
The truth is...

623
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,774
I loved him till the end.

624
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:35,214
Make no mistake,

625
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:37,520
I wish my father hadn't done
those awful things,

626
00:32:37,564 --> 00:32:42,221
and I wish I could
sort my feelings more cleanly.

627
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,223
But I can't.

628
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:50,011
And maybe
there's something to be said

629
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:52,709
about a child's willingness
to forgive their fathers

630
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:54,581
for the terrible things
they might have done.

631
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,933
But for what Hiram Lodge
did to all of you...

632
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:01,631
I apologize.

633
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:07,420
And I also apologize
for the fact that...

634
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:10,597
that I will always...

635
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:17,169
always love... my Daddykins.

636
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:21,782
I wish I didn't,

637
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:25,307
but... I do.

638
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:32,096
Thank you.

639
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:49,549
Good. You're awake.

640
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,303
Hey. Hey, who are you?

641
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:08,437
I'm the bogeyman.

642
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,483
I'm Betty's blind spot.

643
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:14,878
I've heard every one of your
secret whispered conversations,

644
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:16,489
and I'm not sure why,

645
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:19,274
but I know
that piece of rock there

646
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:23,017
makes your flesh
weak and vulnerable.

647
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,323
So I'm going to get ready,

648
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:28,022
and then we're gonna have
a grand old time

649
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,938
chopping you up
into little chunks.

650
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:39,032
Archie?

651
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:42,384
Archie, where are you?

652
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:45,866
Get rid of her,
or I'll hack her up too.

653
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,868
Do it now.

654
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:49,130
Alice.

655
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,653
I'm just cleaning.

656
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:52,481
I'll come by later.

657
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:54,962
Well, you can,
but your dog can't.

658
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:56,398
He got into my closet again

659
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:58,705
and ruined
my favorite kitten heels.

660
00:34:58,748 --> 00:35:01,186
It's fine. Just go, please.

661
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:04,319
I'm leaving him here.

662
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,366
We'll talk
about compensation later.

663
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,370
Well done.

664
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,373
But don't worry.

665
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:17,767
We'll be visiting Alice later.

666
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:25,123
Bingo...

667
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,602
Bingo, kill!

668
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:35,916
Good boy.

669
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:39,267
Bingo. Bingo. Come here, boy.
Hey, come here.

670
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:40,747
Come here. Yes.

671
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,488
Good boy. Good boy.

672
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:44,838
Good boy. Yes, good boy.

673
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:51,366
It was great seeing you, Mom.

674
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,107
Circumstances notwithstanding.

675
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:57,372
I love you, honey.
I'm so, so proud of you.

676
00:35:57,416 --> 00:36:00,549
Okay. Thanksgiving at
the Barefoot Contessa's, huh?

677
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:01,833
Anderson and Andy will be there.

678
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:03,987
That sounds nice, Mom.

679
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:09,689
I can take your abuelita
to the airport if you want.

680
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:13,082
Thanks, Reggie.

681
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:17,697
Thanks for coming
to the funeral.

682
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,506
You were the only one
from the gang who did.

683
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,660
I'm sure everyone else was busy.

684
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:28,316
I really enjoyed your eulogy.

685
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:30,710
It resonated with me.

686
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:34,496
And I don't think
I really ever understood

687
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,281
what you had with your dad.

688
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:38,108
If I didn't understand it,

689
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,130
what gives me the right
to judge it in the first place?

690
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:41,808
What you did doesn't matter,

691
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:42,851
because I love you.

692
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:44,898
Thank you, Reggie.

693
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,513
Sorry to ruin the moment.

694
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:54,951
Damn, dude's super quiet.

695
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:57,389
I have something for you,
Miss Lodge.

696
00:36:57,432 --> 00:36:59,652
Found it among
the Russian's personal effects.

697
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:00,609
What is it?

698
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:02,132
It's a recording...

699
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:03,960
that Hiram made
during his final moments.

700
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,226
Give it a listen.

701
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,364
I still can't wrap my brain
around the fact

702
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:18,584
that TBK was here

703
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:20,847
the whole time
right under our noses.

704
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,762
I mean, where did you even
hire Dennis,

705
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:24,372
if that's his name?

706
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:27,897
He saw my ad for crew
in Jug's newspaper.

707
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:29,745
He must have been trying
to keep tabs on you through me.

708
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:34,077
God knows how long
he's been spying on me for.

709
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:37,255
Long enough to know
that Glen was being a dick.

710
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:40,562
And to know that we were
manifesting our powers.

711
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:41,868
And weaknesses.

712
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:43,696
And side effects,
like my headaches.

713
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:47,830
Well, at least now we know

714
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:49,314
what he looks like
without a mask on.

715
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:50,790
Yeah.

716
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,115
Though, he could have
really hurt you.

717
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,359
Luckily, Bingo remembers
his commands

718
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:55,708
from his old dog-fighting days.

719
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:58,319
He saved my life.

720
00:37:58,363 --> 00:37:59,668
Pushed TBK
right out that window,

721
00:37:59,712 --> 00:38:01,017
and then TBK ran off.

722
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:02,280
Yeah, he does that.

723
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:05,283
What about Glen, Betty?

724
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:09,417
I found most of him.

725
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:12,246
Including his head.

726
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:15,989
So now I need to leave.

727
00:38:17,947 --> 00:38:19,384
I need to get out of Riverdale.

728
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:20,994
I don't understand. Why?

729
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:23,344
Because I brought TBK here.

730
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:25,433
He went after Glen,
he went after you.

731
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:28,349
If I leave, he will follow me.
I know he will.

732
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:29,655
Betty, if you're a target...

733
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:30,849
Well, better to be
a moving target

734
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:32,745
than one standing still.

735
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:35,617
I'll lead TBK out of Riverdale,
and then I'll circle back.

736
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:38,881
Something will distract him.
Something always distracts him.

737
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:42,363
Are you...
Are you gonna be okay?

738
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:44,713
Yeah, I'll be fine.

739
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:48,369
Just keep that palladium
away from me.

740
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:50,284
Hmm.

741
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,459
And come back in one piece.

742
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:53,982
Deal.

743
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:12,437
Mija,

744
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,265
I don't have much time left.

745
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:17,746
But I need you to know one thing

746
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,227
Whatever I may have said
about wishing I had a son,

747
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,709
all of that changed the moment
I first held you in my arms.

748
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:28,322
You became
my treasure instantly.

749
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:32,500
And I want you to know that,
despite our troubles,

750
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:35,634
you have always been
the apple of my eye.

751
00:39:35,677 --> 00:39:37,679
Everything I did,
no matter how heartless

752
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:39,942
or inexplicable
or unjustifiable was...

753
00:39:40,856 --> 00:39:41,856
for you.

754
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:44,686
I think perhaps I was testing

755
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,733
the limits of love a daughter
can have for her father,

756
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:51,389
and you, mija amada,
never faltered, never failed.

757
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:55,567
I never felt anything less than
love for you or from you.

758
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,698
I hope you believe that.

759
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,441
One last thing.

760
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,965
I'm leaving you my rum business,

761
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:04,924
the crown jewel of my empire.

762
00:40:07,187 --> 00:40:08,928
I don't think I was ever happier

763
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:10,471
than when we were
in the middle of our rum war.

764
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:13,323
Do you remember?

765
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:15,456
Those were good times,
weren't they?

766
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,634
I always wanted to be
a good father to you, Veronica.

767
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:25,161
I love you so much.

768
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:54,930
We'll have no more of that,
I think.

769
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:06,004
So the story hasn't been about

770
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:07,943
things I can't do anymore.

771
00:41:07,987 --> 00:41:10,293
It's about the things
I've learned to do differently.

772
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:13,819
And what new possibilities
lie before me.

773
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:15,473
Did I leave
the oven on at Pop's?

774
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,040
Tabitha.

775
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:21,217
Did you just say something?

776
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:28,703
I'm sure I turned the oven off.

777
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:30,531
But did I lock the door
behind me?

778
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:34,535
Tabby.

779
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:38,156
Are you wondering
if you left the door unlocked?
