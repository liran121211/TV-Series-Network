1
00:00:01,827 --> 00:00:04,482
The following isn't
an imaginary story.

2
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:06,136
It happened.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,140
It starts with a corpse
on a lonely country road.

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,666
While in the town
of Rivervale...

5
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:20,063
Archie Andrews has somehow
just come back from the dead.

6
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:21,195
Arch?

7
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:23,980
Sorry I woke you, Betty.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,375
No. It's okay.

9
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:31,161
I was having a nightmare.

10
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:32,554
What was it about?

11
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:42,042
The whole town
was sacrificing you.

12
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,353
Sorry I woke you, Fangs.

13
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:50,920
Oh, I was just...

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,444
having this crazy-ass dream.

15
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:55,664
You were...

16
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:59,102
drowning.

17
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:01,931
And you came back as a ghost.

18
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:06,414
Was I trying
to hurt Baby Anthony?

19
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:12,507
I was having
the strangest dream, Reggie.

20
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,075
Did I get dragged to Hell in it?

21
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,686
Nana, what are you doing
in my room?

22
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,819
I had the most
frightful dream, child.

23
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:23,126
Same. I, um...

24
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,781
You and I swapped bodies
for some reason.

25
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:16,266
Morning. How'd you sleep?

26
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,400
Uh... I'm not sure.

27
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:21,619
Oh, were you up late writing?

28
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:23,621
No, I woke up
in Archie's garage.

29
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:25,449
I think I was sleepwalking.

30
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:27,973
Oh, it's probably just nerves.

31
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:29,671
Yeah.

32
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,803
Wait, what am I supposed
to be nervous about?

33
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:36,634
Well, it is your first day back
at school teaching, isn't it?

34
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:38,941
You know, it's got
to be slightly nerve-racking.

35
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:42,901
But don't worry, it will be great.
You will do great.

36
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:43,875
Hey, Jughead!

37
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,661
What's up?

38
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:54,756
Ben?

39
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:57,541
You're Ben Button?

40
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,369
Of course I am.
Who else would I be?

41
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:01,719
Ben, you died.

42
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:04,896
You jumped out of a window when you
sacrifice yourself to the Gargoyle King.

43
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:11,120
No, you're thinking of that
dude from Stonewall Prep.

44
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,733
Mr. Chipping? Yeah.

45
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:17,387
No, no.

46
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:20,912
You did it first.

47
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,740
Maybe you hallucinated it?

48
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:25,439
Yeah, maybe I'm just
hallucinating all this...

49
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:30,270
FYI, daytime hallucinations are a
symptom of paranoid schizophrenia.

50
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,837
But listen, have an awesome day.

51
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:38,974
Jug, hey!

52
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:41,106
You okay, bro? You look like
you're about to pass out.

53
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,673
Just light-headed.

54
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:45,154
What's going on?

55
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:47,263
Not much. Just updating
everyone on the wedding plans.

56
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,027
Wedding?

57
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:50,551
Who's getting married?

58
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,381
Awkward.

59
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:57,384
Jug, Betty and I are getting married
this weekend, and you're my best man.

60
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,996
Impeccable timing, as always.

61
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,913
Yes, Dr. Curdle?

62
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:08,525
Miss Cooper, I have some
very distressing news.

63
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,399
This afternoon,
I received a corpse.

64
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,011
Jughead Jones's corpse.

65
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:18,622
Is this more of your
gallows humor, Doctor?

66
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:23,061
Because I'm looking right at
Jughead, who is very much alive.

67
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:25,542
That's not possible.

68
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:27,781
Look, if you're still upset about
not being invited to my wedding,

69
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:29,198
get over yourself.

70
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:31,069
Goodbye and please
stop harassing me.

71
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,682
Hey, you okay?

72
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:37,511
Yeah. Dr. Curdle's attempt
at humor, I guess.

73
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:39,991
He claims that your body
is on his slab,

74
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:43,343
which is obviously impossible
because I'm talking to you.

75
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,869
Mr. Jones.

76
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,002
It can't be.

77
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:52,264
And yet it is.

78
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:55,659
Well, may I?

79
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:21,032
It's a paradox. It must be.

80
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,730
How did I... How did he die?

81
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:24,427
Asphyxiation.

82
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:27,517
His wind pipe was crushed.

83
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,692
He was strangled.

84
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:30,433
And where was he found?

85
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,087
The Lonely Highway.

86
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:36,047
At the town limits. By the sign.

87
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:37,744
Face down.

88
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,531
Where are his clothes,
his personal effects?

89
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:49,409
Keep this body on ice
and under wraps, okay?

90
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,282
The Lonely Highway, you said?

91
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:36,934
It was impossible,
yet happening.

92
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:40,634
Somehow, I had in my possession a set of
comic books that seemed to be about me

93
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:41,809
and my friends.

94
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,290
Where had I gotten them?

95
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,945
I couldn't remember.

96
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:51,471
And why was my doppelganger
clutching one when he died?

97
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:54,561
For that matter, how did I
even have a doppelganger?

98
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:59,827
Hoping to find sane answers for these impossible
questions, I sat down and began to read...

99
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,350
from the beginning.

100
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:20,432
How many more boxes
of comic books do you have?

101
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:21,588
This is just a fraction.

102
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:22,763
I'll be honest with you, Jug.

103
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,678
I didn't know you were
that into comics.

104
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:27,028
Well, what can I say, Archie?
I contain multitudes.

105
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:45,176
Hey, how was
your first day back?

106
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,395
Tabitha.

107
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:51,139
I feel like I'm living in a
movie about parallel universes

108
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:53,358
and I need your help
to figure this out.

109
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,360
Okay.

110
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:58,712
I've been having
these strange hallucinations.

111
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,017
And these comics,

112
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,628
they're about us.

113
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,630
Our lives.

114
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:06,676
The first 95
are called Riverdale,

115
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,200
and they're set
in a town called Riverdale.

116
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:12,856
And then there's this explosion,
and suddenly it's Rivervale.

117
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,903
Okay, So you think Riverdale

118
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:18,688
is a parallel universe
to Rivervale?

119
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,560
No, no.

120
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:23,954
I think Rivervale is a
parallel universe to Riverdale.

121
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,260
It's like the comics.

122
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:26,870
Riverdale comes first.

123
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:29,569
And then there's Rivervale,
which is a lot like Riverdale

124
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,701
except it's darker, nastier.

125
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:36,053
It's, um, it's like a warped
reflection of Riverdale,

126
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:38,752
and it just keeps
getting more twisted.

127
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:42,494
So we live
in the parallel universe?

128
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:43,800
Yeah.

129
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,149
I know it's counterintuitive.

130
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:50,720
Read them,

131
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:52,940
then we'll talk.

132
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:57,074
And Tabitha did.

133
00:09:57,118 --> 00:10:00,600
And her experience reading them
was very similar to my own.

134
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,602
I remembered
recent events clearly,

135
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:05,082
but going back further
in my memory was...

136
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:06,736
hazier.

137
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:12,500
Reading about events in the Riverdale
comic books made me recall them,

138
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:14,352
but as Tabitha said...

139
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:17,747
That's so strange.

140
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,838
I mean, I remember these things
happening, but not in Riverdale.

141
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:25,059
All this happened here
in Rivervale,

142
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:26,755
didn't it?

143
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:30,673
I went to Betty and Archie next.

144
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:33,633
I wanted to ask them
about one page in particular.

145
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,636
Do you remember
that explosion, Archie?

146
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:38,419
No.

147
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:40,944
Not at all.

148
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,207
That event is the one that
ended the Riverdalecomics.

149
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:45,557
The next issue
is when Rivervalestarted.

150
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:48,430
I have a theory that
that explosion is what created

151
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:51,476
this parallel universe
we currently find ourselves in.

152
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,740
Wait. I kind of remember
something about this.

153
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:58,222
Arch, didn't you have a dream
about an explosion like this one

154
00:10:58,266 --> 00:10:59,528
or am I making that up?

155
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:06,666
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But that was just a dream, Jug.

156
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:11,148
I went to Veronica
and Reggie next.

157
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:13,150
This is impossible.

158
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:14,935
What is it?

159
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:18,112
These comics depict my father
terrorizing Riverdale for years,

160
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:21,811
but my father died the night
before my quinceanera.

161
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:24,727
I was so distraught. We had to cancel
the Jonas Brothers performance.

162
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,338
That's a massive discrepancy.

163
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:30,646
Because in Riverdale,
Hiram is the main villain.

164
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,517
He's like Darth Vader.

165
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:35,520
So if Rivervale is the dark
twin-verse then who is our Big Bad?

166
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:37,827
How come I look different?

167
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,220
What do you mean?

168
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,701
I mean, I look like
two different people, look.

169
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:45,269
Both devastatingly handsome.

170
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:47,837
But other than that...

171
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,187
That might be an anomaly.

172
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:51,885
Have you shown these to Cheryl?

173
00:11:55,062 --> 00:12:00,241
So, according to this horrid
pamphlet, Kevin Keller and Moose Mason

174
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:02,678
discovered the corpse
of my dead brother

175
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,376
whilst secretly
canoodling in the woods?

176
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,856
Yeah.

177
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,921
How's that sync up with your
memory of Jason's death?

178
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:11,818
It doesn't, you ghoul-lunatic.

179
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,863
To begin with,
Jay Jay's not dead.

180
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:16,213
What're you talking about?
That's impossible.

181
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:18,607
I mean, your life was basically
defined by his death.

182
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:23,394
I don't know what to tell you, but I
can assure you he is still very alive.

183
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:25,396
No, he's dead.
You had a funeral for him,

184
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,095
and then you talked
to his corpse for months.

185
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,107
Oh, hey, Jughead.
I didn't know you were here.

186
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,327
You ready to go
hit the court, Cher-Cher?

187
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:46,243
Yeah, I just need a minute.
Wait for me at the convertible?

188
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:48,115
Sure. Don't take too long.

189
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:56,645
Uh... We... We had an
in-memoriam page for him...

190
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:58,473
in our yearbook.

191
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,737
No, hobo, we didn't.

192
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:05,610
Now, if you'll excuse me,

193
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:09,658
my beloved and very much alive twin brother
and I are off to play doubles. Toodles.

194
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:12,792
And feel free
to see yourself out.

195
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,489
And then,
I had one of my hunches.

196
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,367
I was right.

197
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:26,109
Though Riverdale and Rivervale
diverged in ways minor and major,

198
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:27,850
they were analogous.

199
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:31,158
But I needed to understand
the rules of these worlds.

200
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,943
I needed to sharpen my
knowledge of parallel universes.

201
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:37,294
Damn, you're all
knotted up, babe.

202
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:40,080
- What gives?
- Jughead.

203
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,734
He triggered me with all
that talk about my father.

204
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:45,737
- Yeah, Donnie Darko
is the worst.

205
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:47,087
I got you, though.

206
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,784
How can Reggie
make it all better?

207
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,706
Hey, babe. Miss me?

208
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:14,027
I'm sorry, Mr. Jones, but The
Philosophy of Parallel Universes

209
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,726
was checked out years ago
and never returned.

210
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,162
What?

211
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,381
Who checked it out?

212
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,515
Dilton Doiley.

213
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,866
Great.

214
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,389
Can't even ask him
because he's dead.

215
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,741
Mr. Doiley is alive.

216
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:37,224
In fact, he teaches physics
just down the hall.

217
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:43,751
Dilton.

218
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,841
Hey, Jughead.

219
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,452
I heard you were coming back to teach.
We've missed you.

220
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:50,063
Yes, we have.

221
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:54,545
Ethel, what are you doing here?

222
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:55,982
Ethel's my teaching assistant.

223
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:57,853
Oh, yeah?

224
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,378
So, I shared
my wild theories with Dilton

225
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:05,252
- who, miraculously, said...
- I believe you, Jughead.

226
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:08,081
And I know a thing or two
about parallel universes.

227
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:11,911
Okay. I think the explosion at
the end of issue 95 of Riverdale

228
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,826
is what created Rivervale,
like the Big Bang.

229
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,394
- It's as valid as any theory.
- Why do you think

230
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:20,571
the events that happened in Riverdaleare
playing out differently here?

231
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:24,880
In my research, parallel
universes are exact copies

232
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,100
or mirror images of one another.

233
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:29,406
What you're describing is...

234
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,106
- something in between.
- Like a warping, right?

235
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:34,758
And...

236
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:37,110
I don't know, I have this...

237
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:41,027
impending sense of doom,

238
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,159
like something bad
is going to happen.

239
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:46,467
- What do we do about it?
- Do?

240
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:49,296
We do nothing.

241
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,038
At any given moment,
there are an infinite number

242
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:55,606
of parallel universes in peaceful
coexistence with one another.

243
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,782
Just forget it, Jughead.

244
00:15:57,826 --> 00:16:00,785
- Live your life.
- Dude, I'm not just gonna drop it.

245
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:04,267
I became aware for a reason,
conscious of the two universes.

246
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:07,096
Why? What about
the other Jughead?

247
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,445
Isn't that a paradox?

248
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:11,013
It sounds more like
an anomaly than a paradox.

249
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:12,623
Dilton, he was
murdered by someone.

250
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,887
Then, have Sheriff Keller
investigate, if you want.

251
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:19,761
My advice, stop trying to figure
out the secrets to the universe.

252
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,938
You have
a good life here, Jughead.

253
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:25,853
Go with the flow.

254
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,686
So, you're saying he's me?

255
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:35,255
No, bro, you're me.

256
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:37,953
- There is no you, all right?
- There is, though.

257
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,868
I mean, based on
Jughead's earlier visit,

258
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:44,612
there are two parallel universes,
and, apparently, two Reggies.

259
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:47,006
But I came first.
I'm Reggie Prime, baby.

260
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,791
Yeah, but you've been
in, like, three issues.

261
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,011
- I've been in dozens.
- Guys...

262
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:56,841
It doesn't matter who came first
or who has been in more issues.

263
00:16:56,885 --> 00:17:00,019
You're both here now
and whatever else,

264
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,672
we obviously
can't have the two of you

265
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:04,675
running around town freaking
everybody the hell out.

266
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:09,854
So, you're both staying here
incommunicado until further notice.

267
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:11,204
I have to get the casino ready

268
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,167
for the bachelor and
bachelorette parties tonight.

269
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:16,035
- What? No. I'm coming.
- Yeah, I want to go.

270
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,428
It's Archie's bachelor party,
and I can't miss it.

271
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:21,040
I would much rather crash
the bachelorette party.

272
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:45,977
Yeah!

273
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:53,246
- How're you hanging in there?
- Yeah, good.

274
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:58,792
You know, I'm not going to lie, I've been
thinking about my dad a lot recently.

275
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:01,080
He would've loved this.

276
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:04,213
Me marrying Betty? Come on. He
would have been beside himself.

277
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,088
This is stupid, but I keep...

278
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:13,004
I keep imagining...

279
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:15,268
that, somehow, he'll show
up for the wedding...

280
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:20,099
He'd be standing
next to us, smiling.

281
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,970
It's not stupid, Arch.

282
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:37,159
Come on, the night
is young. Let's dance.

283
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:38,639
Who wants to dance with me?

284
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:47,778
Excellent. Thank you,
other Reggie.

285
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:50,955
- I knew I could count on you.
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:54,176
Come on, Reginald. Don't be shy.

287
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,401
You know, we could have a sweet
thing here, the three of us.

288
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:04,099
Nobody has to know.

289
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:09,539
Sorry, Ronnie.

290
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,979
I'm not used to sharing.

291
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:18,069
Yeah, well, me neither.

292
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,986
You know what, guys?

293
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,207
The irony is, Veronica Lodge
is more woman

294
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,688
than either of you
can handle alone.

295
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,744
Thank you.

296
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:42,093
Oh-ho-ho!

297
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,533
Do you guys remember
when we were in high school,

298
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:50,798
we'd party too hard and be hung
over, and we could just skip class?

299
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,626
Yeah, the good old days.

300
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:56,195
Being a teacher sucks.

301
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:59,807
- Oh, my God.
- Babe, what's wrong?

302
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,200
My brother has been kidnapped

303
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,202
by some lunatic calling himself
the Black Hood.

304
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,164
What? Who's the Black Hood?

305
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,644
How the hell
should I know, Cousin?

306
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:12,491
But he's demanding some
insane ransom and saying,

307
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:14,343
if I don't pay,
he's going to kill my brother.

308
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:19,348
Listen, Archie, I know
this is gonna sound nuts.

309
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:21,916
I think I know where
Jason Blossom is being held.

310
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,068
Is this another one of those
parallel universe things?

311
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:26,877
Well, yeah.
But if the events of Riverdale

312
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:29,489
are repeating here
in Rivervale, then...

313
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:31,612
I think Jason Blossom is
being held at the Whyte Wyrm.

314
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,668
What do you want to do?

315
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,192
Let's get Sheriff Keller
to back us up...

316
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,237
and let's go save him.

317
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,113
Jason, Jason...

318
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:48,508
What the hell is going on here?

319
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:01,956
It occurred to me that whoever
was under the mask

320
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:04,785
was most likely the same person
who killed my double.

321
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:09,224
Rivervale's big bad.

322
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,444
Not Hiram Lodge, but...

323
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:13,924
Clifford Blossom.

324
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:30,419
Excuse me. Are you kidding?

325
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,616
Why aren't you dressed
for the rehearsal dinner?

326
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,859
- Either of you?
- He started it.

327
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:38,079
I don't care who started it.

328
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:43,345
I am so done with this macho,
toxic, competitive bull crap.

329
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:47,131
We're all adults here. So, we should
be able to act like we're adults.

330
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:49,786
But until that happens,
you're both grounded.

331
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,919
- What?
- No fair!

332
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:55,444
You two need to work out whatever it is
you need to work out in order to co-exist.

333
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:57,925
You're out of the Pembrooke
and out of my life.

334
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:04,148
Idiot.

335
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:14,333
I want to thank everyone for being
here on this very special occasion.

336
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:19,120
It's not every night that a mom
gets to host the rehearsal dinner

337
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:23,646
for her daughter's wedding
to the finest young gentleman

338
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,042
in this town, Archie Andrews.

339
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:31,175
Now, I think my husband, Hal,
would like to say a few words.

340
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:32,351
Just a few, though.

341
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:35,702
Thank you, Alice. Uh...

342
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:40,141
I remember
when Betty was born, she...

343
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:47,278
Toni? What is it?
What's happened?

344
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:49,150
I knew it
even before Toni said it.

345
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:50,804
She's dead.

346
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:54,982
Who's dead, Toni?

347
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:56,549
Cheryl.

348
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,551
She was strangled.

349
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:04,208
Betty and I went to Thornhill
straight from the rehearsal dinner.

350
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:06,254
The scene there
was a gruesome one.

351
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:09,649
The rules of this universe were
making less sense every day.

352
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:13,043
It was as if Riverdale's reality was
trying to reassert itself on Rivervale,

353
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:15,219
and innocent people
like Cheryl were dying.

354
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:17,265
How could I take Dilton's
advice to do nothing?

355
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:19,920
Wait a minute.

356
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:23,532
Dilton. I've been wondering
who this universe's big bad is.

357
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:27,884
Could it be meek Dilton Doiley
hiding in plain sight?

358
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:31,081
Well, considering you're here in the middle
of the night, I think it's time we talk.

359
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:33,194
- A little busy right now, Jughead.
- No.

360
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:35,457
Dilton, you asked me
to sit down and do nothing.

361
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,285
But it's happening again.

362
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:39,808
The same events that took place
in Riverdale are happening here!

363
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:41,942
People are dying.

364
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:44,074
Yes. Isn't it glorious?

365
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:45,728
What?

366
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:50,777
- Oh, you know what's going on, don't you?
- He does.

367
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:54,345
I'm sorry, Jughead.

368
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:56,043
But I had to see
what would happen

369
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:58,001
if the universes
remained conjoined.

370
00:23:58,045 --> 00:24:00,526
And now, we know.

371
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,571
They've become
dangerously unstable,

372
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:05,574
and eventually, they're both
going to implode.

373
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:06,923
Why are they going to implode?

374
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,577
Riverdale and Rivervale,

375
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,274
the two universes are expanding,

376
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:11,624
as universes do.

377
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,602
But they're still linked
at the point of creation.

378
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:15,932
So, what? They're bleeding
into each other?

379
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:17,934
They're just going to expand
into each other?

380
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:20,241
And I, Dilton Doiley,

381
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,635
will have a front row seat
to their destruction.

382
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:24,941
I'll be the first scientist
to document

383
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:28,336
a prime and pocket universe
collapsing in real time.

384
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:31,992
How do we stop it?

385
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:34,473
We don't. We can't.

386
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:36,953
It's too late.

387
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,406
Ethel?

388
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,539
I snuck poison
into his grape juice.

389
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,280
Why?

390
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:01,171
Because he was willing to let
everyone in two universes die,

391
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:03,066
just so he could study

392
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,547
what happens when
the twin-versus implode.

393
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:07,767
Ethel, do you know how to save
these universes?

394
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,206
Of course I do, Jughead.

395
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:15,731
Well, one of them,
the prime one,

396
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:19,300
I can save Riverdale.

397
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:22,564
Reggie?

398
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,351
Reggies?

399
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,843
You dim, egotistical,

400
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:43,019
narcissistic morons.

401
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:51,593
When I said "Settle this,"
I didn't mean with a duel.

402
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,471
That's the moment in time
the pocket universe,

403
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:02,430
this universe, was created.

404
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,475
If we could recreate the
circumstances of its birth,

405
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,879
then theoretically,
the same energy

406
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:09,089
that conjoined them
could also separate them.

407
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,570
We just need to figure out
what that moment was and where?

408
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,615
I think I know.

409
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:15,878
Archie's bedroom,
when that bomb exploded.

410
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:18,640
No, I think it would have to be a more
significant event than just an explosion.

411
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:19,926
That might not sound like a lot,

412
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:22,929
but it was a confluence
of good and evil.

413
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:25,496
Archie and Betty's love,
Hiram's, hate.

414
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,629
There was creation.
I was in the garage, writing,

415
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,718
and destruction, the explosion.

416
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:32,199
There was science.
Archie had this...

417
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:33,592
chunk of palladium on his desk,

418
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:34,897
and magic.

419
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:36,769
Cheryl's curse on the town.

420
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,771
That might definitely do it.

421
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:42,078
Okay, so by your logic,

422
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:45,342
we just have to accurately recreate
the events in Archie's bedroom.

423
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,084
As closely as we can.

424
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:50,783
And the universes
should separate, yes,

425
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:52,262
The prime universe
will stabilize,

426
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:53,916
and our universe will...

427
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:57,180
Cease to exist.

428
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,708
Everyone in Rivervale will die?

429
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:07,408
Jughead, Rivervale
wasn't ever meant to exist.

430
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:11,978
You, me, all of us,
our town, we're just...

431
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:16,156
Aberrations.

432
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:21,640
One, big, messy anomaly
that will simply stop being.

433
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:24,730
And if we do nothing...

434
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,907
both universes will collapse?

435
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:30,736
Billions will die?

436
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:39,658
So we just need to detonate
a bomb under Archie's bed.

437
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,790
- With Betty and Archie in it.
- What?

438
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:45,272
No, no, no.

439
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:47,796
We're not blowing up
Archie and Betty.

440
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,103
They're about to get married.

441
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:53,759
We have to recreate the
circumstances as closely as possible.

442
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:56,042
I mean, if not Betty and Archie,
then maybe it could be...

443
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:01,331
Me and Veronica.

444
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,725
What are we, if we're not
counterparts to Archie and Betty?

445
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:06,118
Ethel...

446
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:07,642
you're brilliant.

447
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,691
So if,
what you're saying is true,

448
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:15,694
and we do this...

449
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:19,219
we won't die?

450
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:21,700
No.

451
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:26,226
We'll... cease
to exist painlessly.

452
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:27,880
All so Riverdale,

453
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:33,015
a universe we don't even know
for sure exists,

454
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:36,366
- can be spared.
- It does exist, Veronica.

455
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:40,762
It's a universe
of high school dances,

456
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:44,200
and masked serial killers,
of football, and milkshakes

457
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:45,854
and musicals, and cults,

458
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:48,727
diabolical board games
and murderous nuns.

459
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,209
It's a world where
billions of people will die

460
00:28:53,253 --> 00:28:55,603
if we don't split the universes.

461
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,130
All right.

462
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,308
Let's do it.

463
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:09,182
Let's make out
to save the universe.

464
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:10,225
One thing.

465
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:13,839
Can we do it during the wedding?

466
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,928
Because I'm not really
in the mood?

467
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:17,973
Yeah, I hear that. Same.

468
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:21,716
Here's to Vughead
becoming cannon.

469
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,421
Is it possible
to be nostalgic for a life

470
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:32,858
that you're not
even sure is yours.

471
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:36,315
Flipping through the yearbook,
I remembered things

472
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,341
as if I'd seen them
in a movie of my life.

473
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:41,823
All right, Lodge.

474
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,129
We doing this or what?

475
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:51,572
Archie, what are you doing here?

476
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:53,792
You know, when you didn't
show up to my wedding,

477
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,229
I knew, you'd be doing
something stupid

478
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:58,797
like trying to separate
the two universes.

479
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,799
Well, I can't let you do that.

480
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,279
Before you do anything final,

481
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:04,953
know that Veronica
is on her way here right now.

482
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:06,500
No, Jug, she's not.

483
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,981
Ronnie's dead.

484
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:11,853
I killed her.

485
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:16,684
What?

486
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,078
Why would you do that?

487
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:22,516
Because you told her the truth
about the universe,

488
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,039
and she was gonna
help you destroy it.

489
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:27,129
You killed Cheryl...

490
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:30,785
and the other Jughead?

491
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,834
Not Hiram or Clifford or Hal,

492
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:36,985
you're Rivervale's Big Bad...

493
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,924
I'm not a villain, Jug.

494
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:41,840
No one stays dead here.

495
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,800
Cheryl and Ronnie.
They'll be back.

496
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,454
All the people we've lost...

497
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:52,938
Everyone comes back to life
in this universe.

498
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:57,029
Everyone comes back.

499
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:00,032
Is this about your dad?

500
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:01,381
Don't you get it?

501
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,820
He's coming home.

502
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,039
He has to.

503
00:31:08,562 --> 00:31:09,868
He would never miss my wedding.

504
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:11,695
Especially not to Betty,
he loved Betty.

505
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:14,350
Archie, how do you
know all this?

506
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:16,048
The rules of this world?

507
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,677
How did you know
to kill the other Jughead

508
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:18,983
before I even showed
you the comics?

509
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:21,880
Bro, I know all the secrets
of this universe.

510
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:27,146
I was at ground zero
for the birth of Rivervale.

511
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:30,845
The moment of creation
and destruction.

512
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,716
The threshold of revelation.

513
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:36,024
I saw everything.

514
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:39,767
The other Jughead, the dead,
coming back to life,

515
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,683
the distortions.

516
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:45,860
It's not a copy or a mistake

517
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,166
like you think it is.

518
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,690
It's another chance for me
to be with my dad.

519
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:51,648
Archie...

520
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:53,172
If we don't separate
these universes,

521
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:56,740
and soon, everyone's
going to die in both of them.

522
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:58,568
And you don't know
that Fred can come back.

523
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:03,225
- Not everybody does...
- If there's a 0.001% chance

524
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:04,357
that he will,

525
00:32:05,271 --> 00:32:07,447
I want to be here
waiting for him.

526
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:11,755
I'm sorry.

527
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:39,305
Hey.

528
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:44,745
Never leave a Cooper woman
standing at the altar.

529
00:32:44,788 --> 00:32:47,226
Hey. Hey, are you okay?

530
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:49,271
How did you know to come here?

531
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:50,969
When Archie stood me up
at the altar,

532
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:53,058
something clicked.

533
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:55,408
I don't know, like,
my life flashed before my eyes.

534
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:56,757
I knew to come here.

535
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,600
You also know that
Rivervale should not exist.

536
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:03,198
That bomb needs to be detonated.

537
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:04,504
By us?

538
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:07,245
If you're willing.

539
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,513
What we do now. We just wait?

540
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:15,645
No. We need to recreate
the moments before

541
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:17,691
the original explosions
closely as possible.

542
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:19,475
Oh, well, Archie and I...

543
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,130
I know, I read it in the comics.

544
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:40,018
Hey. Whoa.

545
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,671
Hey, sorry. Look...

546
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:43,562
There may be a way
to separate the two universes

547
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:44,848
without erasing this one.

548
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:46,850
Okay?

549
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:48,306
Well, we should probably stop the bomb.
Betty, could you please disarm it?

550
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,505
What I'm... What?

551
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:50,985
I don't know
how to disarm a bomb.

552
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,031
Yes, you do.
You went to the FBI Academy.

553
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:54,293
You've actually done it before,

554
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:55,976
when Polly had a bomb
strapped to her body

555
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,518
You came back from the dead too.

556
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:03,867
Where were you

557
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:07,088
after Archie strangled you?

558
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:10,004
The great Pop's Chock'lit
Shoppe in the sky.

559
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:20,338
From the second I walked
through that door,

560
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:22,712
I immediately felt at peace.

561
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:25,019
The sweet Hereafter Pops
is a lot like ours,

562
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,977
except it also sells comics.

563
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,157
It's like one of those
old fashioned soda shops.

564
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,420
Everything about this Pops
is old-fashioned.

565
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:36,900
Grab something to read,
and have a seat.

566
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:39,773
It's all you can eat.
On the house, of course.

567
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:48,434
And that's when I found it.

568
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:50,871
A special comic book

569
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:54,744
that came in between
issues 95 and 96,

570
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:58,096
and it bridged the gap between
Riverdale and Rivervale.

571
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:01,011
It told the tale of two
linked universes

572
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:02,796
and how, if that second universe

573
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,581
were to become separated
from the first, it would die.

574
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:08,367
Unless a new power source
could be found and maintained.

575
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:14,851
I was looking around
at all these comic books.

576
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,592
All these wonderful stories

577
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:18,681
made me realize what that
power source could be.

578
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:23,033
And so I resurrected,
and I came right here.

579
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:24,470
What is the other power source

580
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:26,473
that's going to fuel Rivervale
after it separates?

581
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:31,520
Imagination.

582
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:34,610
It's limitless and all powerful,

583
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:36,786
it's boundless
and ever replenishing.

584
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,180
There's no fuel more potent,

585
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:40,790
no generator more awesome.

586
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:42,270
I don't understand.

587
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:43,967
I think I do.

588
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,448
The explosion
is destruction, right?

589
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,494
What's the opposite
of destruction?

590
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:51,105
- Creation.
- Exactly.

591
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,256
I mean, it's all the comics,

592
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,326
how Jughead here
is gonna save Rivervale

593
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:55,849
by becoming a living battery.

594
00:35:56,676 --> 00:36:00,375
- A, um...
- Story generator?

595
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:04,162
That powers Rivervale by writing
the stories that fuel the universe?

596
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:06,285
So it doesn't have to keep
leeching off of Riverdale.

597
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:11,473
It's an over-simplification,
but, yeah, you write,

598
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:12,735
and Rivervale lives.

599
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:16,652
One thing though,
once you start producing,

600
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:18,524
you will have to be
in complete isolation.

601
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:24,573
I mean, think about if someone
saw two Jugheads

602
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:29,317
just walking and talking, it could
actually break down reality, so...

603
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:31,058
Well, no. No!

604
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:32,190
Then why can't you do it?

605
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:35,497
I'm the narrator.

606
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:36,585
He's the writer.

607
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:38,326
What does that mean?
This isn't fair!

608
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,588
No! It's...

609
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:42,722
It's how it has to be...

610
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:47,030
if everyone is going to live,
our family, our friends.

611
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:49,163
This is why I became aware,
isn't it?

612
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,165
Because I'm both inside
and outside of the story.

613
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,970
In the end, the universe knew I'd be
the only one capable of saving it.

614
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:56,387
All right.

615
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,391
Where do I set up shop?

616
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:00,827
Dilton's bunker?

617
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,177
Your typewriter is already
down there.

618
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,310
You'll have plenty of paper
and tons of food.

619
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:09,052
And once you're settled,
we'll, uh, seal you in.

620
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:12,969
This is insane. I will not be
able to live with myself, Jug.

621
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:15,537
Actually, you will, in time.

622
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:18,932
Well, very quickly, actually.

623
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:23,458
Soon you will forget all about
Jughead's sacrifice for you and for us,

624
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:25,155
and he will fade from memory.

625
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,724
Oh, my gosh!

626
00:37:28,768 --> 00:37:30,944
- This is...
- Hey, Hey! Look at me.

627
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:34,730
I need you to be strong.

628
00:37:34,774 --> 00:37:36,471
Please.

629
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:38,647
I need you in my corner
for this one.

630
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,127
Make sure that bomb goes off.

631
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:42,260
Jughead.

632
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:44,740
It's gonna be okay.

633
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:46,741
Really.

634
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:51,269
We got this. You and me.

635
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:54,924
Saving the universes.

636
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:11,811
It was at this moment, that
Jughead and Betty began, yet again,

637
00:38:11,854 --> 00:38:13,943
the doomsday clock's countdown.

638
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:18,165
While in the living room,

639
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:21,342
Archie Andrews reanimated and
resumed his mission to stop Jughead.

640
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:28,523
Hey, Cooper, whatever happens...

641
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:31,221
We'll face it together.

642
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:40,622
There was
nothing to do but wait.

643
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:41,991
Betty and Jughead
held each other tightly,

644
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:44,844
like children
terrified of the dark.

645
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:49,631
As the bomb's counter
finally reached zero,

646
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:52,460
Betty and Jughead braced themselves
for an explosion that should have

647
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:54,419
obliterated one
or more universes.

648
00:38:54,462 --> 00:38:55,637
But instead...

649
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,336
never happened.

650
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:09,347
The bomb was gone.

651
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,653
The pounding on the door
had ceased.

652
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:15,135
And Betty and Jughead realized
that the storm had passed them by.

653
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,399
They survived.

654
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:19,879
They could resume their lives.

655
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:27,234
There you guys are.

656
00:39:27,277 --> 00:39:29,018
We were just about to send
a search party.

657
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:32,413
Seriously! What were you guys
doing up there?

658
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:36,504
- Um...
- I actually can't remember.

659
00:39:36,548 --> 00:39:38,419
Don't mind him.

660
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:41,103
He always turns into a space cadet
when he's working on a new novel.

661
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,688
No, seriously, what were we...
What were we doing?

662
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:48,732
Oh, come on, Betty. Your
spaghetti's gonna get cold.

663
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:53,173
- Hi.
- Hey. Thank you.

664
00:39:55,654 --> 00:39:57,003
After dinner,
Jughead and Tabitha

665
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:58,700
will start moving his belongings

666
00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:01,094
out of Archie's garage
and into their new apartment.

667
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:05,664
Including a comic book
collection,

668
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:08,188
Jughead had forgotten
that he had.

669
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:11,713
And though he will not know it in the
moment, this collection of comic books

670
00:40:11,757 --> 00:40:14,368
and the secrets contained
within its pages

671
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:18,720
will one day save his
and countless others' lives.

672
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:21,070
So it worked.

673
00:40:21,114 --> 00:40:24,726
Rivervale will continue to exist in
an endless time loop you created,

674
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,554
as long as you keep typing.

675
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:28,077
Luckily, I've got
a lot of stories.

676
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,908
One question, though.

677
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:36,303
What happens in
the prime Riverdale universe?

678
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,266
Guess we'll never know
if someone did something

679
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,704
to change the course
of events in Riverdale.

680
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:12,643
Can you hear that?

681
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:16,386
It's my phone.

682
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,348
- Hello.
- -Get out of that house, Betty!

683
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:23,872
Who is this?

684
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,613
Listen to me,
there's a bomb under the bed.

685
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:27,659
You have to go now, right now!

686
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,662
We have to go.

687
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:32,576
Now.
