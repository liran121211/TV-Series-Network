1
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:11,881
Oh, hell, no.

2
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:14,927
- When I was back there.
- Right.

3
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:16,364
What are you doing in my house?

4
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:17,974
Archie, don't be rude.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,604
I was just talking
to your uncle about the, uh,

6
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:21,282
the town-wide census
I'm conducting.

7
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:24,111
Census?

8
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:25,721
Under what authority?

9
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:26,896
With council approval.

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,767
Well, Alice and Frank.

11
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:31,944
I can assure you,
the questions are standard.

12
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:34,077
How long have you
lived in Riverdale?

13
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:37,080
What problems are you most
concerned with in your neighborhood?

14
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:40,301
And people's answers
will help guide the council.

15
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:42,433
And of course, I'll get
to meet my neighbors.

16
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:46,568
Door by door. Face by face.

17
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:49,832
Tell me, Archie. Would you
like to answer some questions?

18
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:52,139
No.

19
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:53,488
I would not.

20
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:56,317
And I'd like you to leave.

21
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:59,319
Now.

22
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,412
I gotta say I'm shocked, Archie.

23
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,762
He is not a good guy.

24
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:09,895
Oh, good grief, Archie!

25
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,376
You've clearly made up
your mind against Percival.

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,161
It's a shame.

27
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:16,095
He has a lot of great ideas
about how to make Riverdale

28
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,251
a better place to live.

29
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:28,392
It's damp and chilly,
Mistress Abigail.

30
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:30,046
Why don't we
go back to Thornhill?

31
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,701
I'll brew you some of that
yummy tea that you like,

32
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:34,094
and we'll get you warm and cozy.

33
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:37,923
No, as restorative
as your tea is,

34
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,360
it's time to vanquish my enemies

35
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:41,536
and be reunited
with my Thomasina.

36
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:46,062
How?

37
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,020
I shall reincarnate
Thomasina's soul

38
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:50,022
into Toni Topaz's body.

39
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,304
The blood moon
will be rising soon.

40
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:53,765
Perfect time
for reincarnation spell.

41
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:56,072
And once my beloved
has returned to me,

42
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,379
together, we will slay
Fangs Fogarty.

43
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:01,991
And seal our love
for all eternity.

44
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:05,168
And is Mr. Fogarty
the only, um,

45
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,301
enemy you wish to vanquish?

46
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:10,434
No. There are still the three
descendants of my assassins.

47
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:13,089
Come along, Brittania.

48
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,133
Ah!

49
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,886
You're in a good mood today.

50
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,801
I am.

51
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:32,195
I just spoke to my dad and
he wants to visit the casino.

52
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,024
Really? How's his health?

53
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:39,028
He's on the mend,
but it's like he lost his mojo.

54
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:40,812
The truth is,

55
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:43,989
my dad's always wanted to
feel like the big shot.

56
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,948
That's what's most important.

57
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,255
To make him feel like one.

58
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:52,172
Well, in that case,
leave it to me.

59
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,478
The Sheriff's Department
is pleased to announce

60
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:56,350
that the town-wide census
is complete,

61
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,787
and the people
of Riverdale have spoken.

62
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,400
And since the unhoused problem
has been dealt with,

63
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:07,012
their main source of anxiety
is the ongoing gang warfare

64
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:08,536
between the Serpents
and the Ghoulies.

65
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,843
Miss Topaz,

66
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:14,629
since you're a member of the
Council of Four and Serpent Queen,

67
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:16,152
what have you got
to say about that?

68
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:19,111
Well, to begin with,
there is no war

69
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:21,810
between the Serpents
and the Ghoulies.

70
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:24,421
Actually, I've been in constant
contact with the Ghoulies' leader,

71
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:28,251
Twyla Twyst, in efforts
to de-escalate tension.

72
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:31,428
And I believe we're very close
to declaring a ceasefire.

73
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:34,779
Well, I wonder, have you
considered disbanding the Serpents?

74
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:39,262
Okay, if I could just
interject here,

75
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:41,830
Miss Topaz is not on trial.

76
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,266
Your point has been noted,

77
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,529
Mr. Pickens.

78
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:48,402
Now let's please move on
to the next item on our agenda.

79
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,495
What the hell was that?

80
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:56,018
An ambush.

81
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:57,889
Percival went after
the folks in Sketch Alley

82
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,040
and now he's coming after us.

83
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:00,805
Hey, Toni. Fangs.

84
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,982
Oh, hey, Prince!

85
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:06,985
How is my baby boy doing?

86
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:09,031
Yeah, he's great. He's great.

87
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:11,033
I'm bummed to let him go.

88
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:13,383
Nervous, given
everything going on.

89
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,298
Oh, don't be.

90
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,909
I gotta be honest.
I'm having second thoughts

91
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:22,218
about Baby Anthony being raised
around gang culture.

92
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,524
You mean as a Serpent?

93
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:26,309
Kevin, I was raised
as a Serpent.

94
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:28,006
So was Fangs.

95
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,182
I know. I know. I'm just...
concerned for his safety.

96
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:31,226
That's all.

97
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,884
Welcome to
Babylonium, Mr. Mantle.

98
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:38,974
And here we are, our best table,

99
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:40,410
and our best dealer,

100
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:43,544
Ryan. He's one of my favorites.

101
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:46,068
Is there anything else
we can get for you, Mr. Mantle?

102
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:48,331
No. This is all
very impressive.

103
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,854
We aim to please.

104
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:51,136
I'll come by
to check on you later.

105
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,727
But in the meantime, have fun.

106
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,514
Thanks for
hanging back, you guys.

107
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:00,822
Something very, very weird
is happening in Riverdale.

108
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:04,260
You mean, besides us suddenly
developing mutant abilities?

109
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,828
I'm talking
about Percival Pickens.

110
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,831
You heard him. He's been
going around door to door

111
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:12,268
meeting with everyone in town,
trying to recruit them.

112
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,965
Your mom, my Uncle Frank,

113
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,098
Sheriff Keller.
God knows who else.

114
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,969
Ever since Percival
sensed me in his mind,

115
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,406
I've been doing some...

116
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:21,669
research on heightened
psychic abilities.

117
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:24,280
You know, some people think that
mind control is a real thing,

118
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,587
like a skill,
the power of persuasion.

119
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,937
But persuading people
to do what?

120
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,853
What does Percival want
with Riverdale?

121
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:34,116
His family was one of the
original settlers of the town.

122
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,354
Maybe he feels like
he has a claim to it?

123
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:38,903
Whatever it is, it's not good.

124
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:42,690
Jug, if he really made
your friend Doc attack Kev,

125
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,518
what's to say
he didn't compel the people

126
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,650
of Sketch Alley to up
and leave the same way?

127
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:49,697
I mean, if he really can control
people's thoughts, and actions...

128
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,089
Yeah, he needs to be stopped.

129
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:53,831
Classic superhero narrative.

130
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,094
Okay, Betty, can we
throw this guy in jail?

131
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:57,661
- You're the FBI.
- Yeah,

132
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:59,291
but not if we can't prove
he's breaking any laws.

133
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,535
All right, then.
Archie, you are invulnerable.

134
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:02,884
Let's beat this guy up.

135
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:04,035
Break every bone in his body.

136
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,060
I can't do that, Jug.

137
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:07,018
I'd be just as bad as he is.

138
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:08,996
Besides, we tried both of those
things with Hiram repeatedly.

139
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,196
They're temporary solutions
at best.

140
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,088
Percival is going around recruiting
people for whatever big play he's got.

141
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:15,723
What if we do the same thing?

142
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,420
We go to our friends,

143
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:18,987
the people we trust,

144
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,834
make sure that he's not
turning them to his side.

145
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,512
In the short term,
it would stop Percival

146
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:24,427
from amassing
too much power too quickly.

147
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:27,735
We'd be concerned citizens
talking to our neighbors.

148
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:31,042
Guys, what if this is why
we were given our powers?

149
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,653
To protect the town
from Percival.

150
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:36,091
Okay, relax, Professor Xavier.

151
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:41,139
Who do we start with?

152
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:43,403
Well, isn't this fortuitous?

153
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:46,231
Cheryl, have you had any
private contact

154
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:49,147
with Percival Pickens?

155
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,758
Did he stop by to interview you?

156
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,237
For his census?

157
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,935
Yes, but I was taking
a buttermilk bath,

158
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:54,999
so I couldn't receive him.

159
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:57,242
Why for?

160
00:06:57,286 --> 00:07:01,595
We're worried that his intentions
for Riverdale may not be above board.

161
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:04,728
We think he is recruiting
people to his side.

162
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,211
For some nefarious agenda?

163
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:11,494
Honestly, I'd be more worried
about an angry mob dragging me

164
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:14,279
into the forest in the middle of the
night and burning me at the stake.

165
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:15,913
As Archibald Andrews,
Jedediah Jones

166
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:19,439
and Beatrice Cooper
did to my ancestor.

167
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:20,744
Not this again.

168
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,616
Yes, again.

169
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:24,748
That transgression hasn't
been settled or forgotten.

170
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,490
Okay, will you just
let us know if Percival

171
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,840
tries to influence you
in any way?

172
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,146
And for what?

173
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,148
Regarding Mr. Pickens,

174
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:36,107
I'll keep my own counsel
as I always have.

175
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:40,329
And as for you three, my patience,
and this audience is at an end.

176
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:42,200
Come on, Cheryl.
We're the good guys.

177
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:45,116
Spoken like a true villain.

178
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:49,251
Let me show you the door.

179
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:57,389
Stoke the fires
and heat the ovens, Brittania.

180
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,522
We're preparing
arsenic-laced scones.

181
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:01,829
For who?

182
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:05,006
For that unholy trinity
of self-obsessed malefactors.

183
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:07,399
The timing couldn't be
more perfect.

184
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:09,489
I need a corpse
for my reincarnation ritual.

185
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,102
Hurry now. Lest we bake
a scone for you, too.

186
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:50,834
Toni, where are you right now?

187
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:53,358
At school. Why? What's up?

188
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,186
Don't tell me more trouble
with the Ghoulies.

189
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,536
Not the Ghoulies.

190
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,886
But I just got
a call from Alice.

191
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:02,367
She and Frank are convening an
emergency meeting of the council.

192
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,152
Why wasn't I told about this?

193
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:07,895
It's because the meeting is to
remove you from the council.

194
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:10,288
What? Why?

195
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,900
It's Percival's idea,
says Alice.

196
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:16,556
He's using the drive-by
last night as an excuse.

197
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,427
What's his grudge with me?

198
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,386
I don't know. I mean, you're
a pillar of the community,

199
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,085
and maybe he sees you
as a threat.

200
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,478
At any rate, it is
classic fear mongering,

201
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:29,220
and that is why you need to
come with me to this meeting.

202
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:30,308
I'm on my way.

203
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:33,442
What's going on?

204
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:35,618
We want to talk
about Percival Pickens.

205
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,228
We don't think he's a good guy.

206
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:39,579
Did he come by here
for his census

207
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,798
to put ideas into your head

208
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:43,931
or try to shift
your point of view?

209
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:45,802
Or to recruit you for anything?

210
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:49,110
No and no.

211
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:51,286
But...

212
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:55,159
the male Mary Poppins is definitely
up to some serious shadiness.

213
00:09:55,203 --> 00:09:56,770
Why do you say that?

214
00:09:56,813 --> 00:10:01,035
I had one of my associates
look into him for me.

215
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:02,776
And Percival...

216
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,561
doesn't exist.

217
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,607
There's literally
no trace of him

218
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,086
before he showed up
in Riverdale.

219
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,134
And this sounds crazy, but...

220
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,745
he said something
to one of our clients.

221
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,268
I don't know what.

222
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:20,141
And then that client...

223
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,275
killed himself.

224
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,629
Okay. Now, can we
beat this guy up?

225
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,673
Get him thrown in jail?

226
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,675
How does he even have powers?

227
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,329
We were in that explosion.

228
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,852
Not that that makes sense.

229
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,593
None of this makes sense.

230
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,204
But how can Percival
control people's minds?

231
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,300
It's Tabitha. She says we need
to go to the El Royale.

232
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:56,351
Thank you for assembling.

233
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:59,615
We've all heard about the act
of gang violence that happened

234
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,009
at Pop's just last night.

235
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,967
And in response
to that incident,

236
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,535
Percival Pickens would like
to submit a motion.

237
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,063
My motion is for the immediate
removal of Antoinette Topaz

238
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,543
from the Council of Four.

239
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,199
How can Riverdale feel safe

240
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:20,549
with a known gang member
shaping town policy?

241
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:24,771
I think Toni can
and should speak for herself.

242
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,337
Thank you, Tabitha.

243
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,953
Mr. Pickens,
I know you're new here.

244
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:36,478
But I have spent my entire life
in service to Riverdale.

245
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:40,612
After high school, I graduated
college with a degree in social work.

246
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:44,312
I then became guidance
counselor at Riverdale High.

247
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:48,316
I kept its doors open as Hiram
Lodge fought to shut us down.

248
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,753
I then used my position
as a small business owner

249
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:54,757
and proud member
of the LGBTQIA+ community.

250
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:58,282
To help with various
charities and organizations.

251
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:01,764
And if there's any doubt
about my integrity,

252
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:05,246
just know that
I'm raising my son here,

253
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,901
and I'm invested in Riverdale
because of him.

254
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:11,600
And I hope you all let me
continue to advocate

255
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:14,342
for you and this town.

256
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:16,604
Thank you.

257
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,611
Well, let's put it to a vote.

258
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:23,743
See what happens.

259
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:33,753
Miss Lodge,

260
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:36,843
sorry to interrupt,
but Mister Mantle is back

261
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:39,584
at table 12
and he's in pretty deep.

262
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,630
To the tune of $7,000.

263
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,504
All right. I will deal with it.

264
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:47,549
Thank you.

265
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:52,815
Mom.

266
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,557
- Oh, hey, honey.
- Hey, uh, what's going on?

267
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,559
We heard from Tabitha
that there was a meeting.

268
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:59,126
Uh, yeah, there was.

269
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:01,650
Unfortunately, Toni
was voted off the council.

270
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:06,611
And let me guess, Alice.
This was Percival's idea?

271
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:09,397
Except for Tabitha, it was
a unanimous vote, Archie.

272
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,659
Unanimous?

273
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:13,836
Against Toni?
How is that possible?

274
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:18,188
Ah!

275
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,411
How are you boys doing
over here?

276
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:24,978
The House is calling
for a break.

277
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:35,815
How are you feeling, Mr. Mantle?
Are you doing okay?

278
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,035
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

279
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,689
Um...

280
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:43,126
I'm a little bit down,
but my luck is turning.

281
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,302
I can... I can feel it.

282
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:48,175
As a matter of fact, I was
wondering whether or not

283
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:51,265
you guys could float me,
maybe $5,000?

284
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:58,838
Oh, uh, we don't really
do that here.

285
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:01,144
But maybe you should
step away from the table

286
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:03,451
and slow down a bit,
you know, cut your losses.

287
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:08,412
So, you're throwing me
out of my own son's casino?

288
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:10,496
You're going to embarrass me
in front of these guys.

289
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:16,333
♪ Baby did a bad bad thing

290
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:19,423

Just the he-man
I was looking for.

297
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:38,660
I'm sorry I was so cold to you
at Thornhill yesterday.

298
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:40,923
May I interest you
in an apology treat?

299
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,187
Dearest Jug-Jug,

300
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:49,149
may I offer you
a sugary sweet mea culpa

301
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:51,107
for my foul mood yesterday?

302
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,329
Sweet cousin.

303
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,724
I come bearing gifts
to mend hurt feelings.

304
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:09,038
What are you doing, Cheryl?

305
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:11,649
Offering you an olive branch.

306
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,477
Why won't you take one
like your cohorts did?

307
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,828
What did you put
in those scones?

308
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,659
Are you trying to poison me?

309
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,058
"Cohorts."

310
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:32,453
Jug. Archie.

311
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:36,892
Don't eat that scone.

312
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:40,809
I already did.

313
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,029
What's the problem?

314
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:44,204
I think she poisoned them.

315
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:49,383
Okay. Well,
I'm invulnerable, remember?

316
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:50,950
Okay, well, Jughead isn't.

317
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,908
So get a glass of water
and a salt shaker

318
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,312
and meet me
by the bathrooms, okay?

319
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:57,086
Don't take another bite!

320
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,871
Bathroom. Now.

321
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:04,615
Cheryl gave us poisoned scones?

322
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,767
- Yeah, we think so.
- Well, yes, I saw her aura, okay?

323
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,750
So drink this and then throw up.

324
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:16,366
Just go.

325
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,503
- I have been thinking, Fangs.
- Mmm-hmm.

326
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:24,984
What if the Serpents
shed their skin

327
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:28,639
and rebranded a little bit?

328
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:34,558
So we no longer be a gang,
which is triggering,

329
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,778
but a political activist group,

330
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,999
like the Black Panthers.

331
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:44,003
We'd focus more
on community-driven programs

332
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,831
helping the town's youth
and seniors.

333
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,529
Wouldn't we be handing the town

334
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,748
over to the Ghoulies
at that point?

335
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,664
Well, we could ask Betty
for help from the FBI.

336
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:57,538
You want the FBI
to fight our battles for us?

337
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:58,887
Where's all this coming from?

338
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,845
Becoming
a political activist group?

339
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,241
It would take the wind
out of the witch hunter sails.

340
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,419
I gotta be honest.

341
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,543
I don't think the Serpents
are gonna go for it, Toni.

342
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:14,772
They will if we stay
united on this.

343
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:17,036
Fangs.

344
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:19,254
Are we?

345
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:21,778
United?

346
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:27,176
Oh, my God!

347
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,747
Kevin?

348
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,749
What the hell?
You can't just come in here.

349
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,838
We got a warrant, Fangs.
We received reports

350
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:39,041
there's illegal weapons
being stored in this apartment.

351
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,190
Weapons?

352
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:43,410
Absolutely not.
And reports from whom?

353
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,681
- I'll check the baby's room.
- The hell you will!

354
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,204
That's it. He's done.

355
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:56,248
Come on.

356
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,774
What the hell? Let him go.

357
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,692
Kevin, why are you doing this?

358
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,338
Fangs, I'm going to get you
out of here no matter what.

359
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:23,493
But I need to know.

360
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,540
Where did the weapons come from?

361
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:31,022
They were mine.

362
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:35,375
Fangs, why?

363
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:40,728
In our house?
With Baby Anthony?

364
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:43,209
I was storing them.

365
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:45,950
For a battle royale
with the Ghoulies.

366
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:47,648
You stopped talking
to Twyla Twyst,

367
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:51,391
but she reached out to me,
challenged me to a rumble.

368
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:54,307
The other Serpents?
They want to fight.

369
00:18:57,788 --> 00:18:59,181
I'm sorry, Toni.

370
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:12,020
- Hey.
- Hey.

371
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:13,630
How's the scene at the casino?

372
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,458
Dad said he had a blast again.

373
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:18,853
To be honest...

374
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,160
We kind of had a moment.

375
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:25,033
He was losing a lot of money.

376
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:27,992
And I asked him
if he wanted to step away.

377
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:30,995
He didn't
and it's not a big deal, but...

378
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:33,607
it kind of got me wondering,

379
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,175
how did your dad
get into debt with my dad?

380
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,178
Was it gambling?

381
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,441
He was making capital
improvements to the car lot

382
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,204
and the bank didn't want
to give him a loan.

383
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,750
Damn, Ronnie.

384
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:49,354
The guy's finally having a good
time, and you want to squash that?

385
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,320
Not at all.

386
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:55,411
I only wanted to make sure
he was okay.

387
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:57,500
Trust me, he's fine.

388
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:08,859
Horrid news about Archie,
Betty and Jughead.

389
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:10,731
Oh, no. Are they?

390
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:12,689
Very much alive, I'm afraid.

391
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,474
How, I have no clue.

392
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:15,649
No matter.

393
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,260
Tomorrow I shall
pay Toni a visit.

394
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,784
I need some of her blood
for my rituals.

395
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:23,657
Does that mean that you're done
trying to kill the others?

396
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,180
Of course not.

397
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,444
I still hate them,
and I still need a body.

398
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:32,100
It's just a matter of devising how
I might go about vanquishing them.

399
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:39,890
How are you feeling, Jug?

400
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:41,283
Like I swam in the ocean

401
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,503
and swallowed
a bunch of sea water.

402
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:44,828
It was the best way
to flush Cheryl's

403
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:46,419
poison out of your system.

404
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:49,596
Why is Cheryl trying
to kill us all of a sudden?

405
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:53,774
Because of something that
happened to Abigail centuries ago?

406
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,645
- Really?
- Or it was Percival.

407
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:58,909
I mean, maybe he got to her,
suggested that she take us out.

408
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,278
And what better way
to get rid of us

409
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,582
without leaving
any fingerprints?

410
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:03,566
Well, there's one way
to find out.

411
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,457
Jug, you can't read Percival's
mind because he'll sense it.

412
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,657
But maybe try reading Cheryl's?

413
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:09,659
Maybe you'll pick up
some trace of Percival?

414
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,182
Yeah, I'll do it.

415
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:13,663
Just let me get
my sea legs back first.

416
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:19,669
Behold. A bouquet of roses
so beautiful,

417
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:22,411
they needed your presence
to keep them company.

418
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:25,109
Cheryl, what's the occasion?

419
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:28,374
Oh, I just had a sixth sense
that you need a pick-me-up.

420
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:29,417
Was I wrong?

421
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,161
No, on the contrary, I...

422
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:34,293
Ow!

423
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,816
Oh, no.

424
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,992
Do those roses
still have thorns?

425
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:39,559
Poor hand. Let me see.

426
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:44,738
Pray, tell, what ails you?

427
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:49,133
I got voted off the council.

428
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:52,180
Fangs is in jail,
and the Ghoulies

429
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:54,103
are determined to start a war
with the Serpents.

430
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:56,880
Remind me again,
what is the origin

431
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:59,622
of your troubles
with, um, the Ghoulies?

432
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,276
Most recently?

433
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,680
Well, Archie
went ballistic on them

434
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:05,280
after they blew up his house.

435
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,674
For all I know, they're still
trying to kill him.

436
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:10,067
Probably planning
another drive by

437
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:11,330
even as we speak.

438
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:14,115
The Ghoulies wish
to kill Archie?

439
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:17,292
Tell me more about that.

440
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:19,599
You called, Dad?

441
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:27,476
I'm in trouble, Reg.

442
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:30,740
I lost the car lot.

443
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:32,742
The dealership?

444
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,661
How? When?

445
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:40,359
Last night.

446
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:44,537
After we left the casino,

447
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,278
these wise guys invited me
to a private poker game

448
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:48,410
at Cucina's Casa.

449
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:49,846
You went with them?

450
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,413
We were having a great time.

451
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:53,807
Okay.

452
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,809
And one thing led to another,

453
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:58,551
and... and it was like
that time at the race track.

454
00:22:58,594 --> 00:22:59,856
Remember?

455
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,511
You know, I... I...
I couldn't stop.

456
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,212
The more I lost, the more
I had to keep on playing.

457
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:14,262
I was wondering, um...

458
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,092
Maybe you could talk to Veronica

459
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:22,488
and she could talk
to the wise guys.

460
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:25,534
They're sort of her crowd,
aren't they?

461
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,539
Let me see, Dad.

462
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,715
Janet. What can I
help you with?

463
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,238
I hate having to do this, Toni,

464
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:36,458
but I'm here conducting
a wellness check.

465
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,026
I've been informed this may be

466
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:41,463
an unsafe environment
for Baby Anthony.

467
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,422
I received
an anonymous complaint.

468
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,162
I'm here on
a wellness check, Toni.

469
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:46,859
For Baby Anthony.

470
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:51,604
Toni?

471
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:52,474
Is everything all right?

472
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:53,780
Yeah.

473
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:56,696
Yeah. I was
just having deja vu.

474
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:59,176
Janet, I don't know
what you've heard,

475
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,613
but I would never do anything

476
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:03,659
to put Baby Anthony
in harm's way. Ever.

477
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:05,661
Of course.

478
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:08,185
But as a social worker, I have
to investigate every claim.

479
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:11,188
Where is he now? Can I see him?

480
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:14,583
Sure, follow me.

481
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:15,845
He's asleep in his bedroom.

482
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:21,460
Wait. Where is he?

483
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:24,593
Toni, the window.

484
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:29,163
Oh, my God.

485
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,255
Oh, Archibald.

486
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,972
All right, everybody, listen up.

487
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:57,626
The Sheriff's department
and the FBI

488
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,933
are leading their own search
for Baby Anthony.

489
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:03,545
But here in Riverdale,
we take care of our own.

490
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,547
We've divided the town
into a grid,

491
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:08,376
so we'll hit every house
on every block

492
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:10,378
until we find Baby Anthony.

493
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:13,947
This is a 24/7 operation
and we'll be working in shifts.

494
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,818
Let's bring Baby Anthony home.

495
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,918
- Poor kid.
- I hope he's okay.

496
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:31,791
She's not fit to be a mother.

497
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,575
She's the leader of a gang.

498
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:35,272
Put her child in harm's way.

499
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:39,581
No one's safe
in this town anymore.

500
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,023
Picking up on anything?

501
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:48,764
Nothing.

502
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:50,046
I mean, if the kidnappers
are keeping tabs on the search,

503
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,375
they're not doing it nearby.

504
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,334
But I'll keep looking.

505
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:57,294
Okay. I'll take a break. Archie
just texted me. He's outside.

506
00:25:57,338 --> 00:26:00,994
Cheryl, dressed as a Ghoulie,
threw a Molotov cocktail at you?

507
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:02,865
It's hard to mistake
Cheryl, Betty.

508
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:05,346
No matter what she's wearing.

509
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:07,957
We'll stay here and join
the search for Baby Anthony,

510
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,500
will you please
go read Cheryl's mind now?

511
00:26:09,524 --> 00:26:12,266
Yeah, definitely.
And hope I don't get killed.

512
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:15,704
We've got a problem.

513
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,797
My dad lost Mantle Motors
to one of Heraldo's

514
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:23,364
wise guys in a game of poker.

515
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:26,585
What can we do?

516
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:32,068
I'll talk to Heraldo's pals.

517
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:35,855
But now can you admit
that your dad has a problem?

518
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:37,291
And needs to be cut off?

519
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,728
What?

520
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:42,383
Your dad killed people
and blew up the entire town

521
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:43,863
and you hung up his portrait.

522
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:45,952
But my dad has

523
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:48,476
a streak of bad luck, and you
want to bar him from my casino?

524
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,087
You know what?

525
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:53,394
This is my dad's mess.
I'll handle it.

526
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,669
Hello.

527
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:09,236
Toni Topaz,
it's your old friend,

528
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,281
Twyla Twyst.

529
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:13,936
You'll never guess what cutie
patootie I'm looking at right now.

530
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:20,726
You have Anthony?
Where are you?

531
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:24,381
It's time to end this, Topaz.
The Serpents versus the Ghoulies.

532
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:25,818
The winner gets Riverdale.

533
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:30,126
And this little heartbreaker
right here.

534
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,389
Name the place
and I'll be there.

535
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:34,261
Under one condition.

536
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:36,916
You deliver Anthony to Pops.

537
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:39,459
And I'm not going to fight until
I get word from my friend Tabitha

538
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:40,615
that Anthony's safe.

539
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,097
- Deal?
- Deal.

540
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,684
See you at 10:00 in front of the
tuna fish warehouse in the docks.

541
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,363
And come armed.
Because we will be.

542
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:56,544
I'm not comfortable
with this, Toni.

543
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:58,198
Can't we at least loop in Betty?

544
00:27:58,241 --> 00:28:00,940
No. This is how it works.

545
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:02,724
And this is how it has to be.

546
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:05,074
And Twyla doesn't want
to hurt Baby Anthony.

547
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:07,337
She wants bragging rights
that she took me down.

548
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:09,339
Or the Serpents. Or both.

549
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:14,475
Okay. Okay, then I will
wait for Baby Anthony,

550
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:16,477
and then I will call you.

551
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:20,916
What year
do you think it is? 1922?

552
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:25,529
Having a good time, fellas?

553
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:32,014
What's it look like, pal?

554
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,236
Can I ask you about a game
you played yesterday

555
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,368
with my father, Marty Mantle?

556
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:39,412
Yeah.

557
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:41,502
How's he doing?

558
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:43,156
To be honest,

559
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:46,637
he's heartbroken that our
family business is gone.

560
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:48,201
I was wondering
if I could buy it back.

561
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,381
Yeah, that may not work for us,

562
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:53,862
as it's already gone up
in value.

563
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:56,647
See, we're expanding
some of our operations,

564
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:59,955
and we've been looking for a
business like your dad's car lot.

565
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:02,175
So if you were to buy it off us,

566
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:06,614
the price would now include the
projected income for the next five years,

567
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:09,138
not just the $100,000.

568
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:11,314
What sort of operation
are you planning for?

569
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:14,709
I don't think it'd be
your cup of tea.

570
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,668
Are we talking a chop shop?

571
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:22,456
Running contraband, money
laundering, counterfeit play, what?

572
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:24,850
- Get a load of this guy, will you?
- -Please.

573
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:28,244
I was boot licking him
when I was in high school.

574
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:31,987
And you might want someone
to interface with the public.

575
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:36,035
Someone trustworthy and
familiar with how car lots work,

576
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:40,169
to keep the trains running,
so no one gets suspicious.

577
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:42,606
What I'm saying is,

578
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,479
maybe we can help each other.

579
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:55,054
Oh. Hi.

580
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:57,752
Britta, right?
Can I see Cheryl?

581
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,494
Uh, no. Um...

582
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:03,671
Mistress Cheryl is getting
ready for something.

583
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:05,499
For what?

584
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:06,587
A ritual.

585
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:08,589
I...

586
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:10,460
I... I can't say.

587
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:12,854
She made me promise,
and she knows...

588
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,379
She knows when I'm lying.

589
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:20,470
Okay. Listen to me.

590
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:24,039
If you think it really loudly,
I might be able to hear it.

591
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,083
You understand?

592
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:29,523
I'm living
a captive existence here.

593
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:32,004
I'm sure you won't believe me,
but Mistress Cheryl is asleep,

594
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:34,354
and her ancestor Abigail
Blossom has possessed her body.

595
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:36,225
And she's been trying
to kill people.

596
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:37,899
Including you and your friends
on the eve of the blood moon,

597
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:40,099
so Ms. Topaz's soul
will go into the corpse

598
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:42,710
and Thomasina can be reincarnated into Ms.
Topaz's empty body.

599
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:45,539
Are you going to be okay?

600
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:46,627
Until the blood moon?

601
00:30:52,763 --> 00:30:54,896
I can't believe Keller put
us on patrol duty tonight

602
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,918
When everyone else gets be
part of the turkey shoot.

603
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,421
I want to see some action, man.

604
00:30:58,465 --> 00:31:00,336
Exterminate those Serpents
once and for all.

605
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,900
Would you shut
your damn mouth, Walker?

606
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:05,646
What are you talking about?

607
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:07,474
What turkey shoot?

608
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:08,605
With the Serpents?

609
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:12,740
Kevin, whatever else
is happening,

610
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:14,655
Toni is still
the mother of your child.

611
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:17,136
Tell me.

612
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:18,833
What is going on?

613
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,059
Hey, Tabitha, what's up?

614
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,384
The Ghoulies haven't
shown up yet.

615
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:30,192
Do you have Baby Anthony?

616
00:31:30,236 --> 00:31:31,604
No, and Toni,
you have to get out there.

617
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:33,195
I think you walked into a trap.

618
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:37,591
What?

619
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:39,090
It's the Sheriff and his deputies.
They're out for blood.

620
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:40,831
Kevin told me it's going to be
a turkey shoot.

621
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:41,856
Don't let it become one.

622
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:44,946
I'll call you right back.

623
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,731
Everyone, we gotta go. We gotta
get out of here right now.

624
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,743
Hands in the air,
guns to the ground!

625
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,358
Serpents,

626
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:07,801
put your weapons on the ground
and put your hands in the air.

627
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,992
Don't give them
a reason to shoot,

628
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:12,669
that's exactly what they want.

629
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,633
You heard her. The Serpents
are resisting arrest.

630
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:18,110
The hell we are.

631
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:21,940
And I'm live streaming this
right now, you scumbag!

632
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:25,117
So be careful what you do, because
the whole world is watching.

633
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:35,823
Reggie.

634
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:37,825
How are things going?

635
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:42,134
I cleaned up my dad's mess
and I got the dealership back.

636
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:45,659
Oh, and also you don't have to
worry about my dad coming back.

637
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:48,749
I told him he has a problem and
barred him from the Babylonium.

638
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,275
That's not what I wanted, but...

639
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:55,712
okay.

640
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:58,977
Is he gonna get help?

641
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,675
He's fine.

642
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:02,893
That's all you need to know.

643
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:11,467
Hey.

644
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:12,860
- Hey.
- Hey.

645
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,557
Your mom isn't here, right?

646
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:16,187
No, she's at another one
of her secret Council meetings,

647
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:17,865
Yeah, which we have to go.

648
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:19,828
I actually think that
Cheryl needs our help more.

649
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:25,437
Cousin?

650
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:27,831
Why for this crying?

651
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,659
Have you heard about Archie?

652
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:33,402
He's dead.

653
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:36,623
He was burned alive
by a Ghoulie.

654
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:37,667
Oh, dear.

655
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,409
Can I come in?

656
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,455
Of course.
Follow me into the parlor

657
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:43,578
and I'll put on the kettle.

658
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:56,556
Cheryl, if you can hear me,
help is on the way.

659
00:34:13,747 --> 00:34:15,096
Ms. Topaz,

660
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:17,141
are you comfortable?

661
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:19,883
I'm fine.

662
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,885
Are you sorry your turkey shoot
didn't happen?

663
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,453
I can't think what you mean.

664
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:26,934
I've got good news for you.

665
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:29,676
Your bail's been posted
by Tabitha Tate.

666
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,807
You're being released.

667
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:34,072
In the morning.

668
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,988
I don't suppose
I can appeal to you

669
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:40,469
as a mother who's looking
for her child.

670
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:42,123
Oh, you mustn't worry
about Anthony.

671
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:46,475
We raided a Ghoulie lair
earlier this evening

672
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,564
and we found your son.

673
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:52,046
- Luckily,
we got him out safely.

674
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,918
Alas, the same can't be said
about the Ghoulies.

675
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:57,356
It was an absolute bloodbath.

676
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:01,490
Unfortunately, only
one of them survived.

677
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:02,796
Twyla Twyst.

678
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,972
She escaped.

679
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:07,844
Like the roach that she is.

680
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:09,542
And where the hell
is my son now?

681
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:11,761
Safe and sound...

682
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,286
with his father.

683
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,867
You... Villains.

684
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:33,827
You'll never get me out of this body.
It's mine now.

685
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,568
Mine!

686
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:37,731
We'll see how long you last
once this fire gets going.

687
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:45,621
You dare burn me again?

688
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:47,754
As many times
as it takes, bitch.

689
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,637
By the power of fire,

690
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,944
the element of your
original destruction.

691
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:06,338
- So too are you banished...
- I'll kill you all!

692
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,166
From this fleshy vessel.

693
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:10,994
Spirit, we compel you.
Leave her.

694
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:18,132
Friends,
as you've no doubt heard,

695
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:22,484
Percival Pickens has been
nominated for emergency election

696
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:24,399
to the Town Council,

697
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,358
filling the vacancy left

698
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:29,404
by the currently incarcerated
Antoinette Topaz.

699
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:32,625
All those in favor.

700
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,846
And with that,

701
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,240
a huge congratulations

702
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:42,896
to the newest member
of the Riverdale Town Council,

703
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:44,289
Percival Pickens.

704
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:49,381
You're all gonna die for this!

705
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:56,692
Whoo!

706
00:36:58,303 --> 00:36:59,304
It twitched...

707
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:02,045
in my hands.

708
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,358
Mistress Cheryl?

709
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:14,667
Cheryl, is that you?

710
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,930
Yeah.

711
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,021
But where's Abigail?

712
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,342
- Oh!
- Oh, thank God.

713
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:39,996
Oh, honey.

714
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,129
I'm so, so sorry.

715
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:45,524
He's... he's okay.

716
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:47,700
Yeah, we got lucky this time.

717
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:49,179
But now he is safe.

718
00:37:49,223 --> 00:37:51,269
And exactly where he should be.

719
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:56,970
I should tell you, Toni,

720
00:37:57,013 --> 00:37:58,711
it's not easy for me
to say this,

721
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:02,018
but I'm filing for primary
custody of Baby Anthony.

722
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:04,978
No, Kevin, please don't do this.

723
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:07,807
I've been talking
with Ms. Weiss.

724
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,635
Given Fangs
and your recent behavior,

725
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:11,558
it shouldn't be hard for me
to win guardianship.

726
00:38:14,422 --> 00:38:16,250
Kevin, why the hell
are you doing this?

727
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,078
I don't understand.

728
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:20,950
My only concern
is for Anthony's safety.

729
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,359
How's it going, Dad?

730
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:40,100
Oh, it's great.

731
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:41,319
Everything's great.

732
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,671
Glad to hear.
You look happy, Dad.

733
00:38:45,714 --> 00:38:48,848
Oh, yeah. Having the time
of my life, son.

734
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:51,285
Time of my life.

735
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,679
It's not looking good,
I'm afraid.

736
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:56,116
Your father is
on the donor list,

737
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,857
but at this point,
it is highly unlikely

738
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,728
he'll get a transplant in time.

739
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:02,731
Barring that,

740
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:04,429
what do you think, Doc?

741
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:07,649
He's looking at a year.

742
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:10,522
Maybe two, if he's lucky,

743
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,139
Is there anything I can do?

744
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,271
Not at this point.

745
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:24,231
Except maybe just make sure

746
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:27,103
your dad enjoys
what little time he's got left.

747
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,175
This is Agent Cooper.

748
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:57,046
Miss Cooper,
so sorry to bother you.

749
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,309
Have you heard
about the Ghoulies' slaughter?

750
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:01,747
Yeah, I did.

751
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,576
Twenty-two Ghoulies dead.
It's horrible.

752
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,752
I'm sure you've got
your hands full.

753
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:08,449
I do.

754
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:10,103
But there is something...

755
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:11,670
off about the bodies.

756
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:14,716
Off in what way?

757
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,805
According to the Sheriff report,

758
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:21,419
the Ghoulies were killed in a gun
fight with deputies on the scene.

759
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,943
But I would say
the Ghoulies wounds

760
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:26,032
were self-inflicted.

761
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:30,428
Hang on. They...
They shot themselves?

762
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:33,213
Yes, I believe the Ghoulies

763
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:36,129
turned their guns on themselves.

764
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:46,226
There.

765
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:48,750
Sealed away.

766
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,144
Forever.

767
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:52,624
One more thing, Nana.

768
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:08,509
It falls to us three women to
keep the eternal flames burning

769
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:10,946
so that Abigail
will never escape

770
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,818
or lay claim to my body again.

771
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:20,521
Well, at least we saved Cheryl
from being possessed.

772
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:22,262
So that's a win, right?

773
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:23,872
Yeah. But while
we were doing that,

774
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:26,440
Percival got himself
elected on the town council.

775
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,181
The council that we formed.

776
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:30,662
After killing 22 Ghoulies,

777
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:33,229
and almost killing
the Serpents, maybe.

778
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:36,058
So... what? He wants
to take over the town?

779
00:41:36,102 --> 00:41:39,584
Like Hiram Lodge? We stopped Hiram.
We can stop Percival.

780
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:43,588
I don't think Percival
wants to take over Riverdale.

781
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:45,415
Something tells me
he wants to destroy it.
