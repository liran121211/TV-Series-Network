1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:06,330
<i>Well, it's not every day you
learn that you're at ground zero</i>

2
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:07,877
<i>of an extinction-level event.</i>

3
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:10,271
<i>In less than 18 hours,</i>

4
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:13,187
<i>Bailey's Comet was going to
obliterate Riverdale,</i>

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,104
<i>one last twist of the knife,
courtesy of Percival Pickens.</i>

6
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:19,454
<i>And there was nothing
we could do to stop it</i>

7
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:21,456
<i>or apparently escape.</i>

8
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:22,761
What did you find out?

9
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:24,589
I've had the Serpents out
all night,

10
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:27,462
on every road and every highway.

11
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:29,072
<i>And all along the town's limits,</i>

12
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:31,074
<i>there's some sort of
invisible barrier</i>

13
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,076
<i>completely surrounding
Riverdale,</i>

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,520
and it's keeping us
from leaving it.

15
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,688
Yeah, it gets crazier, though.

16
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:40,431
When we were out there on the
highway, a car drove into town.

17
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:43,130
<i>Like there was no barrier.</i>

18
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:46,524
So it's basically, like,
we're trapped in a roach motel.

19
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,135
You can get in,
but you can't get out.

20
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:50,180
Jughead, what about
opening up a portal?

21
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:52,202
I mean, I'll take any dimension
over this one at the moment.

22
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:56,230
I tried. I can only open
portals within town limits.

23
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:57,492
No other dimension.

24
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:58,580
Tabitha, what about you?

25
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:00,103
Have you tried to time travel?

26
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:02,453
Every time line I've gone to,
past and future,

27
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:06,457
there's always a comet that's about
to destroy Riverdale imminently.

28
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,546
- How the hell is this happening?
- It's Percival.

29
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,026
But was he
really powerful enough

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,028
to get Bailey's Comet
to change course?

31
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,291
- I mean, it's a comet.
- He is

32
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:16,467
and powerful enough
to weave the binding spell

33
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,730
that's keeping us all
trapped here.

34
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:20,752
Shouldn't, like, the government try to shoot
the comet out of the sky or something?

35
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:21,840
Why isn't this
all over the Internet?

36
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:23,257
It's a facet of the spell.

37
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,259
Percival doesn't want
anyone to help us,

38
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:28,175
so as far as the world is
concerned, Bailey's Comet is passing

39
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:31,700
over Riverdale tonight,
as it has every 65 years.

40
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:33,136
Great. So that's it then.

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,616
We're all going to die.

42
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:35,984
I'm so happy
I moved here sophomore year.

43
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:37,880
Well, not everyone's
going to die.

44
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:39,229
Archie's invulnerable.

45
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:41,275
What about Big Anthony?

46
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:42,904
- He's immortal.
- Archie and I have already talked about that.

47
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:45,235
They might be the only ones
that survive this,

48
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,977
especially if they're in the
bunker when the comet hits.

49
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,326
Uh, let's not go there yet.

50
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,763
We have enough time
to make sure we all survive.

51
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,852
Percival was a sorcerer

52
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:57,204
and pulling down the comet and making
this barrier are all spells he cast.

53
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:59,293
They are spells, Archie,

54
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:05,255
incredibly elaborate ones rooted in
dark, arcane magics honed over centuries.

55
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,736
- Far beyond my knowledge.
- And mine.

56
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:10,260
But there might be someone
we can consult

57
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,175
with ancient knowledge
that rivals Percival's.

58
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:14,308
Okay, great. In the meantime,
Frank and I

59
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,677
and anyone else who wants to help,
we're going to go into the mines.

60
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:20,183
If we dig deep enough, maybe we'll find
a tunnel that passes under the barrier.

61
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:22,838
<i>Whatever happens,</i>

62
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:26,189
I'm just so grateful
that we can face it together

63
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,364
as a family.

64
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:28,800
But I am so sorry

65
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:31,455
that I can't protect you girls
from what's coming.

66
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:33,240
It's a comet, Mom.

67
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:34,937
And I am so sorry

68
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,504
that I wasn't a better mother.

69
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:38,680
- I was awful.
- No.

70
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:41,770
Mom, we're okay.

71
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:45,165
We know that you would do
anything for us.

72
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:47,645
And we love you.

73
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:51,345
So, so, so much.

74
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,085
I love you, too.

75
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:59,353
How does it feel to be back?

76
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:03,270
Unsettling, but I'm still hoping
for an eleventh-hour save.

77
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,054
Speaking of,
I have something for you.

78
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,278
I saved it from Percival's shop
before we burned it down.

79
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,541
I really can't seem to get
rid of this thing, can I?

80
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:18,198
Thank you, Reggie.

81
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:22,114
<i>You know, all things considered,</i>

82
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:23,831
there are definitely more
banal ways to go out

83
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:27,424
than being obliterated
by a giant magic comet.

84
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:29,992
And I've actually completed almost
everything on my bucket list.

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,260
Alexandra Cabot?

86
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:38,653
Tabitha Tate?

87
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:41,438
What are you doing here?

88
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:44,920
Well, I am here to make
all your dreams come true.

89
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:48,793
Mmm.

90
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:51,361
Every time.

91
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:52,797
Okay, so...

92
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,582
You've heard
of Tommy Comet's, right?

93
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,323
The diner chain
that went belly up.

94
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,107
Yeah, well,

95
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,242
I have just closed a deal
to buy all of their facilities,

96
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:04,200
which means

97
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:09,031
that we can take them over and open up
Pop's diners across the country ASAP.

98
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:11,903
Instant franchising.

99
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,254
Investors are lined up and
we're good on the financials.

100
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:20,303
So all I need from you,
Tabitha, is an immediate yes.

101
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:24,394
Alexandra, this is amazing news.

102
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:27,005
But what? Just say yes.

103
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,964
The thing is, your timing...

104
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:31,662
I just think it's a lot
to take in right now.

105
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,884
Okay. And this is
one of my investors right now.

106
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:39,104
Um, I'm staying
at the Five Seasons.

107
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:41,542
Think on it. But you
have ten hours to decide.

108
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:45,372
And I promise you this is truly
the opportunity of a lifetime.

109
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,246
Hi, this is Alexandra.

110
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:00,038
There you go.

111
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:02,562
All done.

112
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,262
So does this mean
I'm a real Serpent now?

113
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:10,222
Not just the Serpent.

114
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:12,790
Serpent King.

115
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,184
Anthony, you're our son.

116
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:18,274
And you've got the best shot
of surviving whatever's coming.

117
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,557
And it's up to you to make sure
the Serpents don't die out,

118
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,931
and being king
is your birthright,

119
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:30,155
and that's why it's up to you to make sure
that that legacy, our legacy, continues, okay?

120
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,199
Yes, Mom.

121
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,900
Return to us,
Spirit from beyond.

122
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:38,207
Abigail Blossom,
we asked to correspond.

123
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,428
We seek your wisdom, help
an insight appear before us,

124
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,560
sister of the night.

125
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:45,388
Pray tell, why have I
been conjured?

126
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,999
Abigail, hi.

127
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,219
We need your help.

128
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:52,352
An evil sorcerer has called
a comet down upon us

129
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:55,746
- and bound us to this town so that no one can leave it.
- Good.

130
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,574
Why for should I help you?

131
00:05:57,618 --> 00:06:00,055
Listen, I think we may have
gotten off on the wrong foot.

132
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:03,928
So, yes, I'm asking you
to show a little mercy.

133
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:09,978
Also I'll free you
from that ceramic hell doll.

134
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:13,460
A long, long time ago,
when I was still alive,

135
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,986
I spent the most sublime evening
with my beloved Thomasina.

136
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:21,555
She was an astronomer and a
scientist as well as a witch.

137
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:24,949
It's called Bailey's Comet.

138
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:32,566
It's... beautiful.

139
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:35,482
Just like you.

140
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,049
What's it made of?

141
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:39,921
Ice, my love.

142
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:43,925
Comets are made of ice.

143
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,622
I hear what goes on
in this house.

144
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,712
You possess the power
of the Phoenix, don't you?

145
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:52,455
As soon as the comet gets close enough
to Earth, project your power at it.

146
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,239
And melt it?

147
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:58,635
That's kind of basic,
but also kind of genius.

148
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:03,553
But if it is to work, it will
require all of your Phoenix power.

149
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,207
And such an effort
will come at a cost.

150
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,296
What about Percival's trap?

151
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,472
Can you help us
undo his binding spell?

152
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:12,257
Mayhap, though that will take
a greater effort to undo.

153
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:15,217
Therefore, in exchange,
I will require

154
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,568
something more
than an appeal and my freedom.

155
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:19,917
Okay, we're listening.

156
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:22,703
All my underworlders!

157
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:26,271
Any luck finding
a safe passageway out?

158
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:28,491
Not yet.

159
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:30,275
Every time we follow a tunnel
that leads us

160
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,582
to what should be the edge
of town, we hit the barrier.

161
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:36,586
Luckily, I may have divined a
pathway through our little conundrum.

162
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,849
Come, come. Everyone's
gathered at Thornhill.

163
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:42,679
Listen up, Riverdalians.

164
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:45,508
Thanks to some ancestral advice,

165
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:47,118
I believe I might,

166
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,904
might be able to melt the
comet with my Phoenix powers.

167
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:51,688
Whoa, that's incredible news.

168
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:54,474
And there may also be a way to
undo Percival's binding spells

169
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,432
so that we can evacuate
the town.

170
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,567
But, Toni, you and I need
to speak about that privately.

171
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,743
Okay.

172
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:05,354
Hold on. Is it really as easy
as melting the comet?

173
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,182
No, Veronica.

174
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:11,273
There is one huge catch.

175
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:16,191
It will take all of my Phoenix
energies to extinguish Bailey's Comet,

176
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:19,934
which means if I successfully
melt the comet,

177
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:24,286
one or more of the dead I've
resurrected will surely perish.

178
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:26,984
What? Wait. Why?

179
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:31,554
Because it is my powers that are
keeping the resurrected dead alive.

180
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:32,599
Who knew?

181
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:34,383
So, who is on the chopping block

182
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:35,426
exactly?

183
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:36,951
Archie.

184
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:38,387
Jughead.

185
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,649
Polly.

186
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:40,693
My Nana.

187
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:41,912
Dagwood.

188
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:43,740
Alice.

189
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,568
Frank, Sheriff Keller,

190
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:48,702
Fangs and Toni,

191
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:53,663
if Riverdale is to live,
one or many of you

192
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:57,537
or your loved ones, must die.

193
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,372
What can I do to help, Cheryl?

194
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,419
My ancestor, the witch,
Abigail Blossom,

195
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:13,553
is going to help us figure out
a way to break Percival's spell

196
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,599
and escape Riverdale's borders.

197
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:20,777
But first, she wants to spend
one final evening

198
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:26,435
with her beloved in carnal form,

199
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:28,959
and we need two vessels
to make that happen.

200
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,223
I would be Abigail's

201
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:36,532
and you, pending your agreement,

202
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:38,795
would be her beloved

203
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,625
Thomasina Topaz, your ancestor
who was also a witch.

204
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:45,715
Okay, but what about Fangs
and Heather?

205
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,456
Well, Heather's a witch.

206
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:52,983
So she's kind of fine
with whatevs. As for Fangs...

207
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:56,073
it isn't technically cheating.

208
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,640
I mean,
our souls will be elsewhere.

209
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,816
Okay. And where would
our souls be, exactly?

210
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,862
Not to worry.

211
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:04,425
Heather will keep our spirits in
a jar until the lovemaking ends.

212
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,872
There you are.

213
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:15,397
Mom, you, you shouldn't be here.

214
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,703
What are you talking about?

215
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:19,488
Why are you covered in dirt?

216
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,620
I'm on a job.

217
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:23,796
Let me get cleaned up.

218
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:30,804
Archie,

219
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:33,720
one of the reasons
why I came back was

220
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:36,766
I want to tell you that Brooke
and I are getting a divorce.

221
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,029
What? What happened?

222
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,224
I thought
you two got along great.

223
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:41,945
Oh, we do get along.

224
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:46,210
Just we also both realize
that we don't want to spend

225
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:48,691
the rest of our lives together,
and it's okay.

226
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:49,779
You know, it happens.

227
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:53,653
But life... life is precious.

228
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:56,873
And you don't want to waste
a single minute.

229
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,048
You know?

230
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:05,055
Cheers, Daddy.

231
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:08,145
And hopefully, whatever happens,

232
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,278
we don't cross paths
in the afterlife.

233
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:45,356
<i>What's going on?</i>

234
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,793
Good news about the comet,
I hope?

235
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,272
No, um...

236
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:50,753
personal news actually.

237
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:53,756
I'm going to ask Betty
to marry me.

238
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,021
- What?
- Yeah.

239
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:00,589
- Today?
- I was going to use a ring my dad gave me,

240
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:03,853
but I lost it,
probably in the explosion.

241
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:05,637
So since I don't have
a lot of time,

242
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:09,293
I was wondering if you might
still have some rings

243
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,687
from the jewelry shop
you used to run.

244
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,447
- Uh...
- I'm sorry if that's a weird thing to ask.

245
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:14,864
No, no, not at all.

246
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:16,779
Um, actually...

247
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:18,955
Yeah.

248
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,088
You're in luck, Archie.

249
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:24,171
I have an amazing diamond ring in my
personal stash that Betty would flip for.

250
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,535
But franchising Pop's
has been your dream.

251
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:35,711
You've been protecting
the diner all year.

252
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,887
This is the best way
to ensure its longevity.

253
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:41,717
Honestly, as long as there's a giant
hunk of ice hurtling towards us,

254
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,806
I'm not committing to anything,

255
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,809
though, I do appreciate you
willing to be the Jack to my Rose.

256
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,289
Who?

257
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:49,812
Jack and Rose,

258
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:52,032
from <i>Titanic,</i> Leonardo
DiCaprio, Kate Winslet.

259
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:55,122
- Oh.
- Jack dies so that Rose can fulfill all of her dreams

260
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:58,081
like flying solo
around the world.

261
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,169
Never seen the <i>Titanic.</i>

262
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:00,823
- What?
- I know, I know.

263
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,956
I'm more partial to, like,
early James Cameron.

264
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,914
Jughead,
you've gotta be kidding.

265
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,197
The <i>Titanic</i> is one of my favorite
movies of, like, all time.

266
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,483
We have to watch it.

267
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:10,877
- We have to watch it.
- Yes.

268
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,530
Isn't that, like,
four hours long?

269
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:15,055
Three hours and 14 minutes.

270
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:17,535
Look, I know
the clock is ticking.

271
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,364
But trust me,
we need to do this.

272
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:33,856
If you're ready, let's begin.

273
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:42,865
Hear ye, hear ye, great above.

274
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,954
Send two spirits deep in love.

275
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:48,001
Take these vessels for the night
and earthly realm to reunite.

276
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,002
Switch the souls,

277
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:51,004
let flesh remain,
shake thy broom,

278
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,047
that love of flame.

279
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:01,928
Abigail, can this truly
be happening?

280
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:03,016
Yes.

281
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,322
Yes, my love. This is real.

282
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,716
Come. We have oh so much
to catch up on.

283
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:13,853

She's in Riverdale.

297
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:03,206
Oh, my God, Did you tell her
about the comet?

298
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,469
I didn't. I mean,
where would I even start?

299
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:06,993
Arch, you got to tell her.

300
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:08,994
Yeah, maybe.

301
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:11,649
But first...

302
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,262
What are you doing?

303
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:22,834
We may not have much time,

304
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:25,794
but I know what
I want to do with it.

305
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:29,753
Marry me.

306
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:32,801
There's a comet coming.

307
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:35,978
- And I want to be with you for it.
- Then be with me.

308
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:40,982
Arch,

309
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:44,334
I love you so much.

310
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:47,163
That's not part of my
hesitation, okay?

311
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,861
But can we talk about what's
going on with you right now?

312
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:57,086
You put so much pressure
on yourself to be a hero,

313
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,393
when you already are one.

314
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:02,483
Sometimes you
can't save everyone.

315
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:04,920
Sometimes you can
just be scared.

316
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:07,314
And that's okay.

317
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,968
It's human.

318
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,891
Do you remember
when we were kids

319
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,632
and you asked me to marry you?

320
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:26,681
And I told you to ask me again
when we turned 18.

321
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:28,204
So how about this?

322
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,902
Ask me again

323
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:34,254
after Cheryl melts that comet

324
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:35,603
and you and me

325
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:39,041
and everyone else survives.

326
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,348
Or we find another way out
of Riverdale.

327
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,221
Deal?

328
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:54,622
I'm gonna do that for us.

329
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:59,105
Where are you going?

330
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:01,933
I'm gonna break through
that barrier

331
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,066
so I can marry you,

332
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,110
Betty Cooper.

333
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:28,090
- Cheryl?
- Yes, Toni.

334
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:32,486
Do you remember anything?

335
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:34,356
No.

336
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:37,360
- You?
- No.

337
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:40,015
No, um... Neither do I.

338
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:45,324
Toni?

339
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,594
- Thank you.
- Of course.

340
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,076
Anything to possibly
save the town.

341
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:13,222
So tell me, dearest ancestor, how
was your tryst with Thomasina?

342
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:16,573
Beyond my wildest imaginings.

343
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,488
- Thank you, Cheryl.
- Of course.

344
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:22,144
But now tell me, how do we
undo Percival's binding spell?

345
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:23,798
Look there on the altar.

346
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:27,715
What is that?

347
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,693
The knots represent the various
mystical barriers surrounding the town.

348
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:31,719
Once the rope is untied completely,

349
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,851
you and the others should be
able to leave Riverdale.

350
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:38,508
<i>Agent Cooper,
it's been a minute.</i>

351
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,032
Drake, hi.

352
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:44,558
Yeah. Things have only gotten
more insane since TBK.

353
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:48,301
If you can believe that.
What's up?

354
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:52,392
Director Wilcox wants us to head
up the FBI serial killer division.

355
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:53,480
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

356
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,179
<i>That's quite the promotion.</i>

357
00:18:57,223 --> 00:19:00,226
The thing is,
there's a lot going on

358
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:01,618
in my life right now.

359
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:05,056
I'm, sort of,
in a transitional period.

360
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,841
You know, weighing my options

361
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:09,365
for the future.

362
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:11,517
But, Betty, there's no better
hunter of hunters than you are.

363
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,935
I think that chapter of my life
is over.

364
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:16,590
Being a hunter of hunters,

365
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:20,420
I mean, I don't want that
carved on my gravestone.

366
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:26,295
<i>I hate asking,
but is this because of Archie</i>

367
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:30,169
or because TBK messed
with your head?

368
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,213
No.

369
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:35,086
This has nothing to do
with TBK or Archie.

370
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,308
This is all... This is me.

371
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:42,529
It's my decision about how I want
to spend the rest of my life,

372
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:45,619
- for however long that might be. <i>
- Doing what?</i>

373
00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:47,316
I'm moving towards the light.

374
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:51,799
Take care, Drake.

375
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:53,540
<i>And don't be a stranger.</i>

376
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,194
Bye.

377
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:01,330
So, Ronnie, if we survive,

378
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,811
- what's the first thing you're gonna do, you think?
- Hmm.

379
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:09,860
- Maybe a shopping spree in Paris with Katie.
- Oh.

380
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,949
- You?
- Get a dog.

381
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:14,169
- Aw.
- I always wanted one.

382
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,259
Name him... Vader.

383
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:21,045
- Yeah.
- That's sweet.

384
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:28,227
Reggie, the reason
I asked you over,

385
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,360
should we still be here
this time tomorrow,

386
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:34,407
I want you to have
the Babylonium. Sole ownership.

387
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,017
- Wait. Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

388
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,412
- How come?
- The casino was your idea.

389
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,414
Your baby.

390
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:45,418
The only thing that's
really mine is my absinthe.

391
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,333
Maybe I'll focus on that.

392
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,509
And should the sun
rise tomorrow,

393
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:53,208
and we find ourselves
no longer business partners,

394
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,428
any chance you and I
get back together?

395
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:59,301
Tempting, but no.

396
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:02,565
I think it's good we're off
that carousel ride, don't you?

397
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:04,915
Mmm-hmm.

398
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:09,268
And besides, if there is
another chapter for me still,

399
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:12,445
I think it's time
for a hard reboot.

400
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:15,099
On all fronts.

401
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,319
Instead of being
so relationship focused,

402
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:21,497
I'll be single and fabulous
and date a lot,

403
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,458
work on my friendship skills.

404
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:28,025
Starting with,

405
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:31,246
if you're amenable, you, Reggie.

406
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,293
Yeah, I'm down to be friend
zoned by you, Ronnie.

407
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,250
Good.

408
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:39,471
Cheers to that, Reggie.

409
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:45,826
And if you want, when it's
comet time, you can come over

410
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,741
and we can watch
the fireworks together.

411
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:48,959
Sounds good.

412
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,093
- As...
- Yes, Reggie, as friends.

413
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,660
Okay. Just checking.

414
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:03,322
I had no idea.

415
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,673
Right! It's amazing,
isn't it?

416
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,460
You know, you know
how it's going to end.

417
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:15,986
But... it's still a gut punch.

418
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,381
Couldn't they have both held on to
the drift wood of the end, though?

419
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:23,037
No, because it wouldn't
have supported them both.

420
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,649
Jack knew that
they would have sunk, so...

421
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:30,827
he let go
so that Rose could live.

422
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:33,830
I mean,
the resonances are startling.

423
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:36,398
Only you're
a lot cuter than Leo.

424
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:37,442
In my opinion.

425
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:41,447
Can you just make me a promise?

426
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,363
No matter what happens,
if Cheryl stops this comet

427
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,801
or if I live or I die, that you
take Alexandra up on her offer.

428
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:49,759
Take Pop's national.

429
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,892
- Jughead.
- I won't be able to die

430
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:59,639
or live peacefully. If you don't
swear to me, and you're an angel.

431
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:01,902
So I'm pretty sure
that means you can't lie.

432
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:06,863
- Can you just swear, no matter what happens...
- Okay, I swear.

433
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:10,171
But in exchange,
I just want you to agree

434
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:17,570
to go on one
last epic date with me.

435
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:22,531
Okay, but define epic because
we're trapped in Riverdale

436
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:26,317
and time
is now appallingly finite.

437
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,363
Not for me.

438
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:33,803
I'm chronokinetic, remember?
All I need is one minute.

439
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:38,417
- One minute?
- That's all we'll need.

440
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:37,867
Archie, why didn't you pick up?

441
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:39,956
I've been calling you.

442
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,655
Mom, you shouldn't be here.

443
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:46,572
- You don't understand.
- I do. Betty told me everything.

444
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:51,968
About Percival, about you dying and
Cheryl bringing you back to life.

445
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:54,362
I mean, my God, Archie.

446
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:56,190
- Did she also tell you...
- About the comet?

447
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:58,714
Yes, Yes, she did.

448
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,460
And about how now,
I'm... I'm trapped, too.

449
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:18,386
<i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

450
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:21,781
I'm sorry you got caught up
in all this insanity.

451
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:24,566
Archie, none of what
is happening is your fault.

452
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:30,441
Mom, if you... If anyone dies because
of me, I couldn't live with myself.

453
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:32,705
Archie, shouldering this guilt,

454
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:34,750
this responsibility,

455
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:40,887
it's crazy. Like Betty said,
it's okay to be scared.

456
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:45,544
But it's not okay to be out
here hiding from the world.

457
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:50,418
No one loved this
town more than Dad.

458
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:56,337
He built so much of it
with his own two hands.

459
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:02,256
What do you think he'd be doing
right now if he were me?

460
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:10,656
Probably exactly what you're
doing, fighting till the end.

461
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:15,661
But your dad also knew
when to put down his tools

462
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:19,621
and come home to the people
he loved and who loved him.

463
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:23,364
We should all be together
for whatever's coming.

464
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:38,466
Well, Daddykins,
it's just you and me.

465
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:45,865
Figures, it's been
a hell of a year.

466
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:49,825
Your entire body is basically
one giant bio-dialysis machine.

467
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:57,441
There's a reason
you stayed in Riverdale.

468
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:01,749
Oh, my God.

469
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:11,586
Oh, my God. Sorry, Daddy, but I just
figured out a way to save my friends.

470
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,463
Amazing.

471
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:22,728
Well, I can't wait
to start working together.

472
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:26,383
- Which would be when exactly?
- Tomorrow.

473
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:28,777
Bright and early,
I thought we could take out

474
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:31,475
the food truck
and post updates on social.

475
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,174
That sounds like a great idea.

476
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:41,050
Then why the long faces?
What? What am I missing?

477
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:57,937
Cheryl, in the event
that you melt the comet,

478
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,855
I believe I should head back to
Greendale, resume my life there.

479
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:05,814
Why for would you do that?

480
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:08,599
Because I saw something.

481
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:12,560
When we were doing the ritual.
I adore you, Cheryl.

482
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:15,128
But you and Toni
are forever soulmates.

483
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:16,825
How could
you possibly know that?

484
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:21,090
I'm a witch, silly.

485
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:22,875
I know these things.

486
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:23,918
Heather...

487
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:27,096
you opened my heart again.

488
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:29,838
Toni's with Fangs anyway.

489
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:34,800
For now, but you and Toni,

490
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:37,367
your fate
is written in the stars.

491
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:39,935
It transcends time.

492
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,247
<i>Thanks for sending my mom to me.</i>

493
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,859
Yeah, it kind of seemed like
a mom-tervention was necessary.

494
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:55,603
Yeah, my mom thinks
I have a hero complex.

495
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,999
She's probably right.

496
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:03,611
I think it comes from me feeling like
I'll never be able to live up to my dad.

497
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:07,049
Your dad would
be so beyond proud of you.

498
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:11,532
You've been such a rock for everyone
this year, especially for me.

499
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:15,014
You supported me.
You comforted me.

500
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:17,146
You loved me unconditionally.

501
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,408
So thank you for that.

502
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:25,764
I'm sorry for proposing to you in
the middle of all this insanity.

503
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:28,505
So end of the world or not,

504
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:32,771
we're on your timeline.
No pressure ever again.

505
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:37,166
Well, about that, Archie.

506
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:41,997
Been thinking about my life.

507
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:44,957
My future, if I have one...

508
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:47,524
and what I want.

509
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:56,795
- And?
- And I know I said I wanted to wait...

510
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:00,624
but will you marry me?

511
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:04,628
Are you serious?

512
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:07,153
As serious as a comet
hurtling towards Riverdale,

513
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:08,371
- yeah.
- Yes!

514
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:12,811
Yes, I'll marry you.

515
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,563
Okay, this is a crazy Hail Mary,

516
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,914
but I may have an idea for
how to bolster Cheryl's power

517
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:32,831
to, one, improve our chances
of taking down that comet

518
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,572
and, two, augment
her Phoenix energies

519
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:37,966
so that when she uses them up,
no one has to die.

520
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:41,274
I am so happy you uttered
that sentence and not me.

521
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:43,232
I'm a human dialysis
machine, right?

522
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:47,497
I pulled the sepsis from Charles'
blood and leached the chemical thujone

523
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:50,239
out of wormwood to distil
my poison free absinthe.

524
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:53,677
- Randomly, yes.
- No, not randomly, Bee.

525
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:56,593
Everything has
happened for a reason.

526
00:30:56,637 --> 00:31:00,467
What if I can use my gift
to absorb all of our abilities,

527
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:05,994
our strengths and give them to
Cheryl to augment her Phoenix power.

528
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:09,476
Again, the stronger she is, the less
chance her powers will be used up.

529
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,174
And the less chance
one or more of us will die.

530
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:17,136
But, V, our powers aren't poison
or sepsis that need to be removed.

531
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:19,051
It's semantics.

532
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:21,749
Poison, strength, superpowers.
Whatever you want to call them.

533
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,055
It's what you said, Tabitha.

534
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:24,926
This is why
I stayed in Riverdale,

535
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,147
so that I can do this right now
at this exact moment

536
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,586
and maybe maybe the multiverse
gave each of us our specific powers

537
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:37,156
so that they could come
together, combine and save us.

538
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:39,114
How would you absorb them?

539
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:41,900
I would need access to where your
powers are most potent and present,

540
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:44,772
your blood.

541
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:46,948
Remember when we all went
to see <i>It</i> at the Bijou?

542
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:51,779
How the losers club cut their palms
and all held hands in a circle?

543
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:54,956
We need to do the same.

544
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,828
Wound to wound, blood to blood.

545
00:31:57,872 --> 00:32:01,006
And I will take in
our collective life force.

546
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:03,225
I can't cut my hand.

547
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:08,970
I present to you,
one dagger of Megiddo.

548
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:12,539
Fine, but no one is cutting
into my alabaster flesh.

549
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:14,584
Sorry, there are limits.

550
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:20,677
Don't worry, Cheryl, I will be
transferring our powers to you via a kiss.

551
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:26,814
A, that's queer baiting and B,
won't your poison kiss kill me?

552
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:28,990
A, it's not queer baiting,

553
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:32,863
it's saving the world and B, pretty sure
your Phoenix power trumps my poison power.

554
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,482
<i>I don't say what I'm thinking</i>

555

00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:44,109

00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:46,712
