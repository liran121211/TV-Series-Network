1
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:06,093
There's a town that exists
at the borderlands.

2
00:00:06,136 --> 00:00:09,009
A place of nightmares
and dreamscapes.

3
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:11,272
A place where folklore and myth

4
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:14,623
carry the weight of fact
and truth.

5
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,234
A place where superstition
and their laws

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:19,584
overshadow the laws of science,

7
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:22,631
and a place where
old traditions die hard,

8
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:24,372
if they die at all.

9
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:25,895
The name of this place

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,377
is Rivervale.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,032
And though it might
seem familiar to you,

12
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:34,338
like a town you visited before,
I can assure you,

13
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:37,080
it is not that same town.

14
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:39,300
Don't worry,
I'll show you around.

15
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:41,954
First stop,
Toni and Fangs' apartment,

16
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:43,913
portrait of a couple
in distress.

17
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,307
Baby Anthony finally
fell asleep?

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,049
More like he passed out
from exhaustion.

19
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:51,094
He can't keep going
like this, Fangs.

20
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:53,531
He's literally crying 24/7.

21
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:55,185
Something's wrong.

22
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:58,406
We'll call Doc Curdle,
get Anthony an appointment.

23
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:00,364
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

24
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,850
Ah...

25
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:10,026
There she is,
Miss Tabitha Tate.

26
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,768
And that is
our real estate agent.

27
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,726
And if I'm not mistaken,
those are our...

28
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,163
Here are your keys.

29
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,252
Thank you, Ms. Gordon.

30
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,992
We are so excited.

31
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:21,603
Uh-huh.

32
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:23,779
So, is this your first time
living with a beau?

33
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:25,868
Actually, yes.

34
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:28,262
I've never taken
that step before.

35
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:31,352
I have always been too guarded,
I guess.

36
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:32,570
Too nervous.

37
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:34,137
Of course.

38
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:36,444
This day and age,
you can't be too careful.

39
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,537
Let's check in with Rivervale's
premier power couple,

40
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,713
Reggie Mantle
and Veronica Lodge.

41
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:46,932
I'm sorry, Mr. Banks,
but if you hesitate,

42
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:49,587
I can't guarantee
this opportunity
will be here tomorrow.

43
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:52,764
You'd be getting in
on the ground floor
of a gold mine, Mr. Lance.

44
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,114
Yes, that is correct.

45
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,724
A casino right here
in Rivervale.

46
00:01:58,074 --> 00:02:00,598
[chuckles]
Exhausting, aren't they?

47
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:03,035
Let's head over to Elm Street.

48
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,735
The Cooper house,
where Alice is doing
a lot better,

49
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:10,478
but her appliances,
not so much.

50
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:13,089
Well... [sighs]
that should clear that up.

51
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,004
What was it, Frank?
More chicken bones?

52
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:17,615
No, not this time.
It was a, um,

53
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:19,530
dish rag.

54
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:21,924
Hey, I have quiche in the oven.
Would you stay for breakfast?

55
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,406
[exhales]

56
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:28,670
Tempting,
but let's go next door.

57
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:31,020
Where my old chum
Archie Andrews

58
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:34,545
is living with my ex-girlfriend
Betty Cooper.

59
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:37,069
Let that one sink in
for a minute.

60
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:40,290
And while we're all
good friends, I should probably
end the tour here

61
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:44,207
and leave whatever is happening
upstairs to your imaginations.

62
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,993
[ticking]

63
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:50,082
[explosion]

64
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:52,824
-[Archie gasping]
-Arch.

65
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,481
You okay?
Was it another nightmare?

66
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,701
-Yeah. Sorry I woke you.
-No, it's okay.

67
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:02,530
Was it a bad one?

68
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:05,359
It was surreal.

69
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:09,928
We were talking up here
in my room,

70
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:12,235
and we heard this
ticking noise.

71
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,802
Mmm-hmm.

72
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,717
It was a bomb under the bed.

73
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,937
Oh, my God. That's awful.

74
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:24,029
Yeah, the weirdest part,
we were living in a town
called Riverdale.

75
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:29,209
-Riverdale with a "D."
-Yeah.

76
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:33,169
Okay. No more Twilight Zone
marathons before bed, okay?

77
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,650
[both chuckle]

78
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:39,610
Let's make all those bad dreams
go away with some
early morning delight.

79
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:49,968
[phone ringing]

80
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:53,494
[Betty sighing]

81
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,978
Kev, what's going on?

82
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:04,809
Where are you?

83
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,115
I was jogging when I found it.

84
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,422
[Archie] Whoa.

85
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,948
The way the deer's
laid out looks...

86
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,257
ritualistic,
like it was sacrificed.

87
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,437
And its blood was used
to draw these runic symbols
all over the stone.

88
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,308
Who would do that?

89
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:28,572
I don't know,
but whoever did
took the deer's heart.

90
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:31,096
Okay, uh, never gonna
jog here again.

91
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,447
Nor should you, interloper.

92
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,668
You merry three are trespassing
on the sacred sovereign nation
of Thornhill.

93
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,583
Be gone from
its borders immediately,

94
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,498
or else my pupils
will shoot you full of arrows.

95
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,848
-Like who, girls?
-St. Sebastian.

96
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:46,111
Mistress Blossom.

97
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:48,549
Cheryl, this is a crime scene
so I need to collect
all of the evidence,

98
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:49,854
including the deer.

99
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:51,595
You will do
nothing of the sort.

100
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,293
My girls and I will assume
possession of that carcass.

101
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:54,598
To do what?

102
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,252
We will make a stew
from its meat,

103
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,949
a pelt from its hide
and a paste from its hooves.

104
00:04:57,993 --> 00:04:59,211
That's a little barbaric.

105
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:01,997
No, you sad, simple, she-child.

106
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:07,089
It's a part of a sacred circle
of life and death,

107
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:10,222
of use, reuse and rebirth,

108
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:13,878
of paying respect
to what the Earth gives us,

109
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:16,185
all of what she gives us.

110
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:20,755
Now leave my land, heathens.

111
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:24,106
Girls.

112
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,067
Toodles.

113
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:42,777
I'm afraid Baby Anthony
has colic.

114
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,256
Colic?

115
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,434
It's quite common
and can last indefinitely.

116
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:50,698
There might be gas
in his intestines
causing the discomfort--

117
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,395
What can we do, Doc?

118
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,006
Because he's crying 24/7.

119
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,095
It's agony for all of us.

120
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,836
I do know
of an old folk remedy.

121
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:04,973
I'd like to put this toad
in Baby Anthony's mouth.

122
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:06,627
It'll suck the colic
right out of him,

123
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:08,237
absorb it.

124
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:11,196
No more crying.

125
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,938
I'm sorry,
but there's no chance in hell

126
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:18,421
I'm letting you put
a frickin' frog
in my baby's mouth.

127
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:22,686
In that case, the only other
recommendation I can make
is ear plugs.

128
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:28,997
How many more boxes
of comic books do you have?

129
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,216
Oh, it's just a fraction.

130
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,175
The rest is still in storage.

131
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:34,611
You know, to be honest
with you, Jug,

132
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:36,439
I didn't know
you were that into comics.

133
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,876
Well, what can I say, Archie?
I contain multitudes.

134
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,790
Come on.

135
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:42,227
[exhales]

136
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:44,447
I really appreciate
your help, Betty.

137
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:46,231
I hope you don't feel weird
being here.

138
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:48,495
No, not at all.

139
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:51,106
Honestly, I'm very happy
that you and Jughead are taking
this step together.

140
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,978
Meanwhile,
what about you and Archie?

141
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:56,024
Are you all in?

142
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,113
It's really weird, Tabitha.

143
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,158
Back in high school,
one of the biggest questions
in my life was...

144
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:04,641
"Am I going to end up
with Archie or Jughead?"

145
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:08,732
And now it seems like we have
a definitive answer.

146
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:15,086
Today's your lucky day,
Cameron.

147
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,788
I'm wondering if you
or any of your boys want
to invest in a boutique casino

148
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,703
a colleague and I
are opening up in Rivervale.

149
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:25,053
So this is what
you've been up to, Veronica.

150
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:28,535
As usual, the she-wolf
is making lemonade
out of lemons.

151
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:30,450
I don't even know
what that means, Cameron.

152
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:33,496
This casino or whatever
is obviously a distraction

153
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,804
till you come back to New York,
where you belong.

154
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:40,242
As usual, Cameron,
you're totally wrong
about everything.

155
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:42,984
I'm all in on the casino
and Rivervale.

156
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:49,773
Tell me straight, Ronnie.

157
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,514
Do you want this casino or not?

158
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:52,994
Of course I do.

159
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:55,910
Ignore Cameron. He's an idiot.

160
00:07:55,953 --> 00:08:00,001
So it's just not another
stopgap till you
get your old job back?

161
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:04,745
Reggie, I did want to go back
to Wall Street initially.

162
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:07,399
But now...

163
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:10,490
I'm having a ball
doing this with you.

164
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,318
And I think our casino
is gonna be huge.

165
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:17,366
Everything happens
for a reason, lover.

166
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:22,763
Everything that's meant to be
finally is.

167
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:26,723
[Tabitha screams]

168
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,986
Jughead, spider!
Spider, Jughead!

169
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:33,295
No, no, no!
Jughead, Jughead, don't!
[groans]

170
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,515
Oh, my God, Jughead.
I didn't want you to kill it!

171
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,821
I wanted you to put in a cup
and take it outside.
You never kill a spider.

172
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:39,344
It's bad luck.

173
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:41,521
[chuckles] Come on,
that's just superstition.

174
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,524
Maybe so, but we just
moved in together,

175
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,830
and I don't want anything
to jinx us.

176
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:48,963
Tabitha.

177
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,531
It's just an itsy-bitsy spider.
What's the worse
that's gonna happen?

178
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,445
It's not like we're cursed now.

179
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,622
[ominous music playing]

180
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:01,279
And next on the agenda,
we have an update,

181
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:03,717
on the town's
reforestation plans.

182
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,631
Archie Andrews.

183
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,285
Thanks, Toni.

184
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,461
Yeah, basically,
we're good to go.

185
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:13,030
As you may know,
since Cheryl declared
Thornhill a sovereign state,

186
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:15,467
we've lost our local supply
of maple syrup

187
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:17,644
as well as the revenue
that the syrup was bringing in.

188
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:20,603
-Aren't our trees already
tapped out anyway?
-They are, Tom.

189
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:22,344
Which is why I propose

190
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:25,477
we buy and distribute
maple saplings.

191
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:28,655
One per family to be planted
in each family's yard.

192
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,745
My crew and I will take point
on seeding a grove
of maple trees

193
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,094
that the town will own.

194
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:34,661
And have we secured
the saplings?

195
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,532
We just got
the shipment in, Alice.

196
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,881
And as we discussed,
Frank and I
will be setting up

197
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,448
a distribution center
outside of Pop's.

198
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:42,277
[crowd murmuring]

199
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:45,280
Hmm.

200
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,414
Riveting.

201
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,548
You might find the discussion
underway at Thornhill,

202
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,029
also about maple syrup,
more interesting.

203
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:00,425
[clears throat]

204
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:04,560
Today,

205
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,867
before we came upon
those intruders in my forest,

206
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,957
I was pointing out
our precious maple trees,

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,961
how dry and lifeless
they have become.

208
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:17,965
I believe our maple groves
have withered away because

209
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:20,881
we have forgotten the old ways.

210
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,535
Ah, the old ways.

211
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:26,277
Before we built our first
settlement in Rivervale,

212
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:30,238
when this area was just land
and river and rocks,

213
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:33,458
it all belonged to her.

214
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:35,373
She who walks amongst
the trees.

215
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,289
We worshipped her.

216
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,857
We gave offerings to her.

217
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:43,686
And she provided.

218
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,036
Maple sap, yes,

219
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,651
but also life
in all its beautiful,
glorious facets.

220
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,960
Over time,
we left the old ways behind.

221
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:59,354
We started taking
the Maple Maiden for granted,

222
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:03,532
and she, in turn, punished us.

223
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,408
All that was once fecund
is now barren.

224
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:14,325
We must again
pay tribute to her,
like our ancestors once did.

225
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:18,721
We must return to
the old ways, the blood ways,
the pagan ways,

226
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:21,724
and by hoof and by horn, girls,
return we shall.

227
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:25,510
But first,

228
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,948
we have to go
into town tomorrow.

229
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:32,082
My spies have told me
that Archie Andrews is trying
to steal my maple thunder.

230
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:35,216
And that simply will not do.

231
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:37,000
[dramatic music playing]

232
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,402
Yes, Mom. I promise.

233
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,364
Okay, yeah. I love you too.

234
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:54,583
All right, bye.

235
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:57,064
Hey.

236
00:11:57,978 --> 00:11:59,153
How's your mom?

237
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,242
Honestly? Yeah, she's good.

238
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:03,548
She says hi. And, uh...

239
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:07,422
She's wondering if we've put
any more thought
into what she asked

240
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:08,510
last time she was here.

241
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,122
Arch.

242
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,777
I thought we decided
that marriage wasn't for us

243
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,171
because everyone we know
who's married

244
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:19,042
is either divorced or dead.

245
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:20,652
No, totally.

246
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:21,697
She was actually asking
about the other thing.

247
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,223
The "when am I going to have
a grandkid" thing.

248
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,445
And what did you say?

249
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:32,360
I told her if it were up to me,

250
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:34,797
-I would want it to happen
sooner rather than later.
-Mmm-hmm.

251
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,190
I mean, my dad was a young dad.

252
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,148
Arch, for the record,

253
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,324
I've been dreaming
about starting a family
with you since...

254
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:41,848
Mmm...

255
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:43,980
Sixth grade.

256
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,289
But let's just take our time.

257
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:50,770
There's no rush,
we're in our twenties.

258
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,597
Okay, so let's just keep
doing our thing

259
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,469
and let nature run its course.

260
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:56,079
-Yeah.
-Like right now.

261
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,254
[Betty giggles]

262
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:08,048
Ooh!

263
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:09,266
[plate clattering]

264
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,184
[motor whirring]

265
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:19,537
Shades of Creepshow.

266
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:21,844
One per household,
plant them in your yard.

267
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:25,021
Make sure there's enough space
for their roots to grow wide
and deep, okay?

268
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:32,768
Well, well, well.

269
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,989
So it is true you are making
a play for my maple birthright
and empire.

270
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:39,601
Cheryl, you don't own
maple trees or maple syrup,
for that matter.

271
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:43,300
I believe every citizen
of Rivervale should be able
to tap their own tree.

272
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:46,477
Then I'd like
13 saplings, please.

273
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:48,175
That way we can plant them
in the Thornhill groves,

274
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:49,567
and they can grow
in the shadow

275
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,874
of she who walks amongst
the trees.

276
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,442
You seceded, remember?

277
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:57,532
These saplings are reserved
for taxpaying citizens

278
00:13:57,575 --> 00:14:01,318
of Rivervale to be planted
in Rivervale.

279
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:04,408
-Unless you want to rejoin
our ranks?
-Rejoin Rivervale?

280
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,976
After you tried to erase
the sins this town
has perpetrated

281
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,414
against my ancestor,
Abigail Blossom?

282
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:14,505
You and I both know
there is only one way
that will ever happen.

283
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:15,898
Over your dead body.

284
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,771
No, Archie. Over yours.

285
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:20,860
Come along, girls.

286
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:27,257
I'm afraid, Miss Cooper,
that the test
came back conclusive.

287
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:30,739
You don't seem to be
producing any viable eggs.

288
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:33,611
It will be difficult for you
to conceive a child.

289
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:37,920
Oh, my God.

290
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:43,273
If it's any consolation,
you're not alone
in this dilemma.

291
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:47,277
No, actually,
it's not a consolation,
but what are you talking about?

292
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:51,978
You're the fifth young,
healthy woman to come see me
who is essentially

293
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:54,415
barren.

294
00:14:58,027 --> 00:14:59,681
[Anthony crying]

295
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,210
[sighs] Look.

296
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:09,952
I know if we pick up
Baby Anthony,
it'll validate his crying.

297
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,649
But this is torture.

298
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:14,870
I was talking to my grandma
about Anthony's colic.

299
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,481
She said back in the day,
serpent mothers would leave

300
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:20,963
their crying babies
on tree stumps
in Fox Forest overnight.

301
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:23,226
They just left their babies
in the woods?

302
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,272
[chuckles] Yes.

303
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:28,231
And when the mothers
went back in the morning,

304
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,493
the babies were sleeping
peacefully.

305
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:31,626
They'd cried the colic out.

306
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:34,281
There's no way a serpent mother
would abandon her baby
like that.

307
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:38,241
Well, apparently,
my mom did it to me.

308
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:41,766
It worked.

309
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,422
Leaving Baby Anthony
in the woods
would toughen him up.

310
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,468
Just like his mama.

311
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:50,862
Reginald.

312
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,168
Will you come with me, please?

313
00:15:58,522 --> 00:15:59,784
Surprise!

314
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,266
[Veronica chuckles]

315
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,313
In case you're worried
that I don't appreciate you,

316
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:09,272
here is cold, hard proof
that I do value you.

317
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,058
Your bonus, sir.

318
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:14,147
And not only that,

319
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,106
there's one thing
I fantasized about doing,

320
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,499
but never have.

321
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:24,287
I've always wanted to make it
on a bed full of money.

322
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:26,898
[seductive music playing]

323
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,697
Bratwurst was delicious
as usual, Alice.

324
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,352
Thank you, Frank.
It's one of my go-to recipes.

325
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,182
Well, I should probably
head back home.

326
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:51,053
Archie and I have a big day
of planting tomorrow.

327
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,968
[chuckles] Frank.

328
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,579
It's the same thing every time.
I make you a delicious meal,

329
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:57,320
and you sprint for the door.

330
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:02,021
So I'm going to make this
plain as day for you.

331
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,980
I like you, Frank Andrews.

332
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:10,986
I find you very attractive.

333
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,076
And I would like for you
to stay the night with me.

334
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:16,731
In my bed.

335
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:22,215
Wow, I am
very flattered, Alice.

336
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,869
You're such a beautiful woman.

337
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:29,178
-But I just...
-You just what?

338
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:31,311
I just, um...

339
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:37,012
can't go there.

340
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,277
Wow. I don't believe it.

341
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:44,280
When will I ever learn?

342
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:46,891
I fall for the strong,
silent type every time.

343
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:56,423
I've been thinking.

344
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:02,864
What if we adopted a baby?

345
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:10,915
Betty.

346
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:17,574
My dad always used to tell me

347
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:20,360
that the most fulfilling thing
that he ever did
was become a father.

348
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:23,798
And I want to do that with you,

349
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:25,408
every step of the process.

350
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:28,672
Arch.

351
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:33,982
You need to believe me
when I tell you...

352
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:39,857
there's nothing more
that I want
than to have your baby.

353
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:43,470
Not just for you, but for me.

354
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,254
I love you

355
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:47,952
so much.

356
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,000
I want to create a life
with you.

357
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,309
I want to be the mother
of your child,

358
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:57,571
our child.

359
00:18:58,659 --> 00:18:59,790
Then you will.

360
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:03,185
It'll happen.

361
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,797
[Anthony crying]

362
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:22,900
Bon soir,Antoinette.

363
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:28,079
Cheryl,
what are you doing here?

364
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:29,951
Just taking in some night air.

365
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,345
What are you doing
with that little bundle
of babe?

366
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,869
It's a long story. I'm just

367
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:36,349
trying to cure his colic.

368
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:37,959
I see.

369
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,832
May I?

370
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,141
Okay.

371
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:49,623
[Anthony stops crying]

372
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:55,194
How did you do that?

373
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,544
It must be the calming perfume
I concocted in my greenhouse.

374
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,502
The ingredients of which

375
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:01,852
I could mix into a more
permanent solution
for his colic.

376
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:05,247
But then you must help me
embrace Rivervale's
oldest of old things.

377
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,858
Fine. Just tell me what to do.

378
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:09,251
Not much.

379
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,906
I just need you to bear
witness and then,

380
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:13,908
per tradition,

381
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,214
everything will be
as it should.

382
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:17,868
[Tabitha screams]

383
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:19,957
Hey, hey, hey.

384
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,916
-What's going on?
-Do you not feel them?

385
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,266
-Feel what?
-Something is biting me.

386
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,703
You seriously not feel like
you're being eaten alive?

387
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:27,617
No.

388
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,707
[Tabitha panting]

389
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:33,144
I'm not seeing any
critters in the bed.

390
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,930
Or on us.

391
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:38,541
Hey.

392
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:42,980
I was having a nightmare
about spiders.

393
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:46,636
And then it felt like
the spiders were biting me.

394
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,986
Okay, well that's what it is.

395
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,553
You're just having a dream.

396
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:53,600
There's no spiders.
These sheets are fresh.

397
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,558
I just got them brand new.

398
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,168
You're okay. You're okay.

399
00:20:57,821 --> 00:20:59,127
[exhales]

400
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,563
Come here.

401
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:01,956
[breathing heavily]

402
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,877
Jug, don't think I'm crazy,
but can you check out...

403
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:13,446
Oh, my God! Your back.

404
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:15,622
Your back is covered
in welts, bites.

405
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:18,015
Same as my arms and legs.

406
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,235
I was literally just about
to ask you to check them out.

407
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,412
I told you we were being
eaten alive,
probably by bedbugs.

408
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:25,632
-Well, we checked the sheets--
-Okay, well, then it's scabies,

409
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:26,981
which you can't see
with the naked eye,

410
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:28,722
but they are vicious
blood suckers.

411
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:30,854
Okay, we'll wash the sheets
with hot water and bleach.

412
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:31,942
Are you kidding?

413
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:32,726
That's not gonna do anything.

414
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:33,901
We're infested.

415
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,032
I'm calling an exterminator.

416
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:36,947
Ugh.

417
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,477
All right.
It's time for arts and crafts.

418
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,262
Take some twine and fabric
from the basket
and pass it along.

419
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,265
Today we are making poppets
to honor the Maple Maiden.

420
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,962
Are the poppets to play with?

421
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:54,225
No, Britta. They serve
a myriad of purposes,

422
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:57,403
but these ones
will be a warning.

423
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:07,630
[Archie] What in the hell?

424
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:14,245
This is Cheryl, 101.
It's got to be.

425
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:16,335
Let's dig these things
out and make room
for the saplings.

426
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,727
You sure you want
to do that, Arch?

427
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:18,685
[Archie] Positive.

428
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:20,948
Double time, boys.

429
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,957
Hey.

430
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:32,307
How'd the planting go?

431
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,310
I know that look.

432
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:37,399
What's wrong?

433
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:41,882
Cheryl.

434
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:45,625
She impaled these dolls
all over the forest

435
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:47,366
where we were going to
plant our saplings.

436
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,020
She did? Why?

437
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:54,198
To spook my crew.

438
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:57,550
Which she did, by the way.
They were anxious all day long.

439
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,029
That's so bizarre.

440
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:01,554
I feel like I've seen

441
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:03,556
-one of these before.
-Where?

442
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,254
I've been sorting through
old evidence boxes
at the FBI office,

443
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:10,171
and I feel like there was
a cold case with totems
like this one.

444
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:11,346
Can I borrow this?

445
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,348
-Knock yourself out.
-Okay.

446
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,305
See you later.

447
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:24,533
Well, Reginald,
what do you think?

448
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:27,144
These are
the finalized blueprints
for our casino.

449
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:29,756
Exquisite, no?

450
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,801
And the best part is

451
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:34,978
you and I are going to christen
every square inch
of this place.

452
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,855
Well, that's a first.

453
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:43,334
Question for you, Ronnie.

454
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:46,425
If the casino was my idea,
which it was,

455
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:50,994
and we'd be equal partners,
then how come you forgot
to give me an office?

456
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:54,650
Shoot.

457
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:58,306
That's a good question, um...

458
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:00,482
You know,
let me just call the architect

459
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:03,267
and I'll have them
redraw the plans.
It won't be an issue.

460
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:05,182
Too late.

461
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:07,271
A picture's worth
a thousand words, Ronnie.

462
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:11,972
[sighs]

463
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:14,017
[cell phone ringing]

464
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:19,675
-Kev, what's up?
-[sighs] I came back
to the forest

465
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,721
because I forgot my shovel
and the saplings...

466
00:24:21,764 --> 00:24:24,071
-Archie...
-What about them?

467
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,029
[sighs] Someone ripped them out
of the ground.

468
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:27,378
They're all destroyed.

469
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:32,732
What do you think
you're doing, Cheryl?

470
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,560
Archie, calm down.

471
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:36,387
I know you and your girls
left those dolls
for us to find.

472
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:39,173
-And did you rip up
our saplings too?
-Why would I,

473
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:43,046
keeper of the Maple Flame,
murder innocent,
nascent maple saplings?

474
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,701
Because you can't stand
the fact there might one day
be a time

475
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:48,922
when Rivervale isn't dependent
on your family for maple syrup.

476
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:49,879
You're out of line, Archie.

477
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,794
If I may enlighten you,

478
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:54,493
I requested this
audience of the four
to offer an olive branch,

479
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:57,974
specifically to invite
the entire town of Rivervale
to Thornhill

480
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:00,368
for a good old-fashioned
maple festival.

481
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:03,632
And just so you know,
Archie, we, the council

482
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:08,071
have accepted
Cheryl's invitation
on behalf of the entire town.

483
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:09,682
-We'll all be there.
-[Cheryl sighs]

484
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:14,382
[exhales]

485
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,714
RB.

486
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,850
Rose Blossom.

487
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:53,377
[door opens]

488
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:56,685
[Cheryl] Cousin.

489
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:58,905
How for did you get
into my house?

490
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:00,602
A bobby pin.

491
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:02,735
But I'm actually here
on official FBI business

492
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:05,564
regarding that deer
you killed in the woods.

493
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:08,741
Really, you and Archie
are just too much.
I mean, I get it.

494
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:10,743
I'd be obsessed with me too.

495
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,658
But what makes you think
I had a hand
in that dreadful business?

496
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,834
So, let me put it this way.

497
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:18,707
That deer was not the first
blood sacrifice
on Thornhill's grounds

498
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:23,233
because 50 years ago,
a drifter was murdered
on your property.

499
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:26,410
Heart ripped out
and poppet shoved down
their throat.

500
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:28,674
What do you want, Betty, hmm?

501
00:26:28,717 --> 00:26:30,414
Because I have a maple
harvest festival to plan.

502
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:31,633
So can we
cut to the heart of it?

503
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:36,943
[Alice] You really didn't have
to walk me home, Frank.

504
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:39,423
I was hoping
that maybe we could talk.

505
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:44,341
What is there left to say?

506
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:46,517
How about...

507
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,607
you're not the problem, Alice,
I am.

508
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,564
[scoffs]

509
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:51,784
[exhales]

510
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:53,960
Years ago,

511
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:55,875
when I was a mercenary,
I was married.

512
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,356
No one knew.

513
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,185
Not even Fred or Archie.

514
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:05,580
Because if anyone found out,
it would put my wife
and my daughter at risk.

515
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:09,236
And then, of course, um...

516
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:14,328
My wife and my daughter
ended up, um...

517
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:15,634
Oh, I'm so sorry, Frank.

518
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:18,680
Alice.

519
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:21,161
I want to open myself up
to those feelings again.

520
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:25,078
I just don't know
if I'm ready yet.

521
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:27,210
And I'm sorry.

522
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:28,168
That's okay, Frank.

523
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,302
I understand.

524
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,827
But maybe...

525
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:38,874
Maybe we can go
to the maple festival together.

526
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:41,660
Maybe that'll be okay.

527
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:49,232
[Tabitha sighs]

528
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:54,063
Here you are.
Straight off the griddle.

529
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:55,717
Delicious, fluffy
pancakes to go.

530
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:57,284
Just what I needed

531
00:27:57,327 --> 00:28:00,200
for my festival's pancake
eating contest. [gasps]

532
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:02,550
But what are these welts
on your arm?

533
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:05,466
And sleepless eyes to boot?

534
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,645
Tell me, what demons
torment you, Tabitha?

535
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:14,997
Turns out our apartment
is riddled with bugs

536
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,825
and Jughead and I
are being eaten alive

537
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,958
and we can't afford to move.

538
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:21,525
And even if we could,
I mean, who's to say
the bugs won't follow us,

539
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,310
now that they're
literally in everything?

540
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:24,572
Tabitha,

541
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:26,879
methinks I can help

542
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:29,142
with an ancient
cleansing formula
I could prepare for you

543
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:31,884
that will take care of
any and all bugs

544
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:34,060
and curses.

545
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:37,541
But said formula
does come with a price.

546
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:39,456
What doesn't?
I'll pay anything.

547
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,242
If that's true,
I'm going to need
your full participation

548
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:44,766
in all
my maple festival's events.

549
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,333
But not just yours.

550
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:48,465
Jughead's too.

551
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:50,598
If we want our
collective fortunes
to turn around for the better,

552
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,948
we all need to be
united on this.

553
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:58,998
Pay close attention, girls,
for this is
a special confection

554
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,261
based on an old family recipe.

555
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:04,394
Back in the early days,
the village priestess
used to bake a sin pie.

556
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:06,788
It was meant to contain
the sins of the entire town,

557
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:09,878
and once it was consumed,
the sins would be absolved

558
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:12,141
and the town
and her folk would prosper.

559
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:13,839
Consumed?

560
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:17,277
-By who?
-Someone chosen.

561
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,974
Someone special
and strong enough

562
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:23,196
to shoulder the weight
of the sins of an entire town.

563
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:27,896
So I was at the FBI office
researching this poppet doll
that you gave me.

564
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,943
And then I paid Cheryl a visit,
and she is definitely
up to something.

565
00:29:30,986 --> 00:29:32,727
I just don't know what.

566
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,120
Well, I'll tell you.

567
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:36,339
For starters,

568
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:40,256
she invited the whole town
to a maple harvest festival
at Thornhill.

569
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,911
And, shockingly,
everyone wants to go.

570
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:45,218
I don't get it, Betty.
Is the world crazy
or am I?

571
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:47,176
No, you're not.

572
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,788
Uh, something evil
is definitely happening
at Thornhill,

573
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:53,313
with that deer sacrifice,
these little pagan dolls

574
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:54,967
and maybe even
a cold case murder.

575
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,620
But when I tried to confront
Cheryl about it,

576
00:29:56,664 --> 00:29:58,840
she gave me
the total runaround.

577
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:01,582
-But she's planning something.
-Thank you.

578
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:04,411
That is why the festival
is a hard pass for me.

579
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:09,242
Oh, we're going, because
while Cheryl is outside
playing hostess of the year,

580
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:12,549
I'll be inside Thornhill
doing some
good old-fashioned snooping.

581
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:14,856
And then we can finally
get to the bottom
of what's happening

582
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,337
in that
pastoral house of horrors.

583
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:28,522
Hey, get away from me.

584
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:29,479
Hey, guys.

585
00:30:30,524 --> 00:30:32,352
Hey, Fangs, Toni.

586
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:34,571
How is this little
cutie patootie doing?

587
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:39,141
[sighs] A lot better, actually.
He's had colic,
but it's cleared up.

588
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:41,187
That's good.
Did you guys get help
from Doc Curdle?

589
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:45,887
We found our own remedy.

590
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:48,455
Anyway, um,
we're going to go
milk the goat.

591
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:50,283
But it was so nice
seeing you guys.

592
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:52,589
-Yeah, you too.
-Good luck today, Archie.

593
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:54,591
[clicks tongue]

594
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:57,594
Good luck?
What does that mean?

595
00:30:57,638 --> 00:30:59,814
Who knows?
But seeing Baby Anthony
just makes me

596
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,730
that much more excited
to make one of our own.

597
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:05,515
[Cheryl] I see you and Reggie
arrived together.

598
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,561
So which ship name
do you prefer?

599
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:09,345
Veggie? Veginald?

600
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,434
I would hold off
on trademarking
either of those, Cheryl.

601
00:31:11,478 --> 00:31:12,914
What?

602
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,263
No, don't tell me
something already happened.

603
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:17,571
No, no, we haven't
broken up... yet.

604
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:21,314
But all of his old insecurities
started rearing
their ugly heads again.

605
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:25,492
Pretty soon he'll be
comparing himself to Archie,
despite all my reassurances.

606
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:27,798
If you want to make it
crystal clear to Reginald

607
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:31,063
that you're no longer
carrying a torch for your ex,
I may have an idea.

608
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,283
[Jughead] Hey, Archie.

609
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:36,068
Hey, I need you.

610
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:38,374
Tabitha has been
flipping flapjacks for, like,
18 hours.

611
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:39,854
And now no one wants
to go against me

612
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,116
in the pancake eating
competition, so...

613
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:44,380
Well, come on.
Starts in, like, five minutes.

614
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:49,559
No, this is good.
If you're competing,
then all eyes will be on you,

615
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:51,735
including Cheryl's.

616
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,389
I'm going to sneak off
and do some sleuthing

617
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:55,000
while you
keep Cheryl distracted.

618
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:05,010
[crowd cheering]

619
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:08,056
And... time!

620
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:11,973
What's the final count?

621
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:15,846
Right, by my tally,
Jughead Jones, 116 pancakes!

622
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,197
[crowd cheering]

623
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:20,851
[woman] Whoo!

624
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:25,987
And Archie Andrews, 119!

625
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:27,554
[crowd cheering]

626
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:29,034
[Tabitha] We have a winner.

627
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,083
You're like a brother to me.

628
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:37,825
I love you.

629
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:40,262
You know that, right?

630
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:42,961
Yeah. I love you back, Jug.

631
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:55,799
Cheryl, you actually think
it's possible?

632
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:59,107
If you two want
a path forward together,
unencumbered by the past,

633
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:01,022
then, yes,

634
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,893
I believe this is the way.

635
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:04,634
Perhaps the only way.

636
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,725
Ah, perfection.

637
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,075
[bell rings]

638
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:11,685
Just in time
for our next challenge.

639
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,730
[rock music playing]

640
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,049
[man] Let's go!

641
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,014
[crowd cheering]

642
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:43,543
And the winner is
Archie Andrews!

643
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:48,330
Hey.

644
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:49,592
What the hell was that?

645
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:52,160
Me losing to Archie, again.

646
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:54,075
You were supposed to lose.

647
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,382
But, after tonight,

648
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:59,385
you won't have to worry
about playing second fiddle
to Archie ever again.

649
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:00,821
Okay?

650
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:04,346
I promise.

651
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,741
Well, according to my sundial,
it's time for sudden death.

652
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:10,265
Who here is brave enough
to challenge Archie Andrews

653
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:13,312
for the crown of Maple King
or Maple Queen?

654
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:14,530
[Betty] I am.

655
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,056
[crowd murmuring]

656
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:24,453
Oh, j'adorea good plot twist.

657
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:26,847
Step right up, cousin.

658
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:31,243
Fittingly, it all comes down
to the most primal
of conflicts.

659
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:35,725
Man versus woman,
the all-American boy
versus the girl next door.

660
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:37,075
I'm giving myself chills.

661
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,123
Hi.

662
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,559
I thought you were sleuthing.

663
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:44,952
Yeah, I was.
And I found something big.

664
00:34:44,995 --> 00:34:46,214
I'll tell you about it
when we get out.

665
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:51,959
[sighs] All right.
The rules are simple.

666
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:53,352
You each get one throw.

667
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:54,875
Closest to the bull's-eye
wins it all.

668
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:56,964
The title, the crown,
everything.

669
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:59,967
Wait, wait,
I thought I won
the last two rounds.

670
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,578
Don't question
my authority, Archie.

671
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:03,927
For that, you're up first.

672
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:17,680
[crowd applauding]

673
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:22,685
Feel free
to bow out now, Betty.

674
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:31,303
[man] Wow!

675
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:33,696
-[crowd cheering]
-[man] Oh, my God!

676
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,916
[Cheryl] I give you
our Maple Harvest Queen.

677
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:36,960
[man] Wow!

678
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:42,662
And for our runner-up...
a pie.

679
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:44,142
[man] Whoo!

680
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,412
Wait, you didn't tell me.
What did you find out
at Thornhill?

681
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:55,892
Oh, there's some definite
weirdness going on there.

682
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:57,503
Like those poppets?

683
00:35:57,546 --> 00:36:00,375
They're actually
fertility dolls.

684
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:02,072
-[Archie] What? Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

685
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,206
So, why don't we put
this little sucker

686
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,948
under our mattress tonight
and try to make a baby.

687
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,169
After you have some pie.

688
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,779
Can we skip the pie?

689
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:13,736
[Betty sighs]

690
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:16,870
No.

691
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:21,875
My Maple King is going
to need all of the energy
he can muster up

692
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:23,181
for what I have planned.

693
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,232
Well, when
you put it like that.

694
00:36:58,564 --> 00:36:59,521
[kissing]

695
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:08,226
[ticking]

696
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:11,533
[cell phone ringing]

697
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:19,759
-Betty?
-Archie, it's me.
They, they have Betty.

698
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:20,890
Kevin?

699
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:25,939
Kevin, what do you mean,
"They have Betty?"
Who's they?

700
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:28,376
Cheryl, some of the others,
they're, they're performing
some kind of

701
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,205
crazy maple ritual
at Thornhill.
You need to hurry.

702
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:50,224
[Archie] Stop!

703
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:53,183
Don't hurt her.

704
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:55,185
[Cheryl] Archie, welcome.

705
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:56,535
We've been expecting you.

706
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:02,584
-What is this?
-A ritual.

707
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:08,242
For me and for all of us here,

708
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,419
something has been made
abundantly clear.

709
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:15,380
If we want our maple trees
to thrive again,

710
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:18,861
if we want Rivervale to have
a bountiful year
in all respects,

711
00:38:20,254 --> 00:38:22,125
a sacrifice has to be made.

712
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:26,695
But the right
kind of sacrifice.

713
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:29,524
Cheryl, this is insane.
I won't let you
sacrifice Betty.

714
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:31,352
Archie.

715
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:34,616
Something amazing happened.

716
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:37,793
I'm with child.

717
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:41,406
Earlier tonight we conceived.

718
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:44,278
A baby, a son.

719
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,846
I know it,
I can feel it in my bones.

720
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,238
It's what I've always wanted.

721
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:52,591
And in 25 years,
he'll be crowned
the Maple King

722
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:54,157
just like his father.

723
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:55,115
Betty...

724
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:58,771
what are you saying?

725
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:04,037
What she's saying is that
women can't be sacrifices.

726
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,431
Women must bear children.

727
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:08,476
But men...

728
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:12,001
Their blood is the seed.

729
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:15,353
Their blood is what nourishes
the ground and the furrows.

730
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:18,747
Their blood is what will bring
Rivervale back to its glory.

731
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:23,491
And the most potent kind
of blood is that of a--

732
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:24,884
Cheryl, I'm not a virgin.

733
00:39:26,494 --> 00:39:29,323
No, you're certainly not.

734
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:35,068
But you have the distinction
of being our town's one
true, pure heart.

735
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:39,812
We needed a king
who was willing to die
for his queen.

736
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:42,380
Only he would be worthy.

737
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:44,382
Jug.

738
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:55,610
Uncle Frank,
you're in on this too?

739
00:39:55,654 --> 00:39:59,353
Archie, you spent
your entire life trying to
preserve and save this town.

740
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,182
Tonight you will succeed
in doing exactly that.

741
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:03,966
You will be a martyr
to your cause.

742
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,924
But--

743
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:25,771
Betty.

744
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:27,033
He's awake, Cheryl, do it now.

745
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,483
She who walks
amongst the trees,

746
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:45,225
accept our sacrifice
and be appeased.

747
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:00,588
[groans]

748
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,960
So ends the heroic life
of Archie Andrews.

749
00:41:25,004 --> 00:41:29,051
Born 25 years ago
in the sleepy town
of Riverdale,

750
00:41:29,095 --> 00:41:31,358
died tonight,

751
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,621
in its shadow town, Rivervale.

752
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:37,930
Now, I hope you've been
enjoying your visit so far

753
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:39,540
because no one
is going anywhere.

754
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:42,630
We're just getting started.
