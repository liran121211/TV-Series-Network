1
00:00:05,744 --> 00:00:10,010
There's this old folk tale I
think would make for a good story.

2
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:11,707
It's called
"The Devil's Holiday."

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,580
And in it the devil
visits a small town

4
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:19,323
in order to collect lost souls

5
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:22,805
and sow the seeds
of destruction and despair.

6
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:24,633
Yeah, here it is.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,680
Now, there are many different

8
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,702
versions of this folk tale,
but in the one I'm imagining,

9
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,684
the name of the town is
Rivervale,

10
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:37,341
and the devil that visits it
can take any number of guises.

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,349
No, no, you keep that

12
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:47,221
and pay me next time, Jim.

13
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:48,222
Thank you, Pop.

14
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:49,397
God bless you.

15
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,357
You have the biggest heart
I know, Grandpa.

16
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,098
Well, I don't know about that.

17
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,075
Grandpa. Oh, my God. Grandpa!

18
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,215
Reggie, what are you doing?

19
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:27,304
Can't sleep.

20
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,091
Are you nervous
about the casino opening?

21
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,876
Must be, yeah.

22
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:35,921
Don't worry.

23
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:40,317
This is gonna be the biggest thing to
happen to Rivervale since maple syrup.

24
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:43,407
I love you.

25
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:46,541
I love you, Veronica.

26
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:51,111
I love you, too, Reggie.

27
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:06,474
Hello.

28
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:08,215
We got him, Betty.

29
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:09,781
Go on. Got who?

30
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:12,175
TBK. The Trash Bag Killer.

31
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:16,048
Where... where... where is he?

32
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:18,790
Being transported to Rivervale
as we're speaking.

33
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:21,141
I need to get you two
in the same room.

34
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,273
Hold on. What? Why? Why me?

35
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:25,101
I need a confession out of him.

36
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,557
And he says you're the
only one he'll speak to.

37
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,235
You, and you alone.

38
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:30,411
Are you up for this?

39
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:35,981
Yeah. Yes, I'm in.

40
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:39,507
Our call with the Gaming Control
Board got moved till 2:00.

41
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,205
So you'll have to take lead
at the staff meeting.

42
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:45,904
No problem, Ronnie,
but we need to hear this.

43
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:49,647
Rivervale's new casino,
aptly named Babylonium,

44
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:52,172
is nothing short
of an abomination.

45
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:56,611
If this house of sin
is allowed to open as planned,

46
00:02:56,654 --> 00:03:00,441
our fair town will be
damned and doomed.

47
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,662
You think she's going
to be a problem?

48
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:10,102
Oh, spare me the spin, Veronica.
Casinos breed evildoing.

49
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:15,020
First come the gamblers, then the
harlots, and then the whore mongers.

50
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:20,591
Alice, we're running this casino
like a corporation, which it is.

51
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:22,593
It's completely legitimate.

52
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:25,030
None of what we do here
is legit.

53
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:27,555
This place was built
for one reason alone,

54
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,514
to separate the players
and their money.

55
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:32,821
Every table, wheel,
and slot machine

56
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:35,040
has been calibrated
to maximize profits.

57
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:38,783
Truly, we're following every rule
and regulation to the letter.

58
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:44,354
Tipped roulette wheels, phony
dice, magnetized slot machines.

59
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:45,877
We put limits on drinks.

60
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:47,923
Ply them with booze
all night long.

61
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:50,708
And, of course,
Gaming Control Board agents

62
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:52,971
will be checking our receipts
every month.

63
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:56,627
When delivering the chips to the counting
room, scoop one third off the top,

64
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,542
that's our weekly skim money.

65
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,719
What we use
to pay the politicians,

66
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:05,897
banks and union leaders
to look the other way.

67
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:09,640
Here's an idea. Why don't you
come to our soft opening tonight?

68
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:12,208
Check out the place,
see what we're really about.

69
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:17,257
I think you'll find we're not quite the
house of the devil you're imagining.

70
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,781
Hmm.

71
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:28,964
Good evening, Ms. Tate.

72
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:32,272
It's a pleasure to
finally meet you.

73
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:38,843
I'm sorry, but who are you?

74
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:40,541
I go by many names.

75
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:42,369
Today it's Mr. Cypher.

76
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:47,287
But since I'm such an old family
friend, you can call me Lou.

77
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,291
I'm here for
your grandfather's soul.

78
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,772
His... soul?

79
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,296
So what, that would make you...

80
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:00,822
Prince of Darkness. Yes.

81
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:05,696
My grandfather would never
sell his soul to you.

82
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,136
True. Terrence Tate wouldn't.

83
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:17,447
However, his father, your
greatgrandfather, was less principled.

84
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:22,365
He sold his eternal soul to ensure
the success of your family diner.

85
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,630
Okay, but what does that have
to do with my grandfather?

86
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:28,434
When Terrence learned
what his father had done,

87
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,809
he couldn't bear the thought of
dear old Dad spending eternity

88
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:34,072
in the fiery pits of hell, so...

89
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:40,252
So he offered his soul
to save his father's.

90
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:45,954
Yes. Which leads us... to you.

91
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:49,000
You want my soul
in exchange for Pop's?

92
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:53,353
Not at all. Just the diner.

93
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:57,313
And then your sweet grandfather will
be free of his obligation to me.

94
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,575
The diner.

95
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:00,795
That's it?

96
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:01,926
That's it.

97
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:08,106
Think it over, Ms. Tate,
and let me know.

98
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,847
But don't take too long.

99
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:12,850
Your grandfather's heart is
liable to give out at any minute.

100
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:40,748
Hey, you.

101
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:42,402
Hi.

102
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,448
How's Pop?

103
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:49,539
He's stable, at least.

104
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,106
How are you? Are you okay?

105
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,588
Unsettled.

106
00:06:54,631 --> 00:07:00,463
This stranger showed up at the
hospital with a claim on Pop's soul.

107
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,858
Does this mean he's...

108
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:06,687
So it would appear.

109
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:12,257
But he's willing to release Pop's
soul in exchange for the diner.

110
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,564
What does the devil want
with the Chock'lit Shoppe?

111
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:16,131
I have no idea.

112
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:19,569
Mind if I ask him?

113
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:20,831
Maybe some other questions.

114
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,661
By all means.

115
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:27,490
Now, remember, this isn't
our official opening,

116
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,449
but we still
need to be on point.

117
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,581
Any questions?

118
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:35,150
Good. It's go time, then.

119
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,507
Let's go place them bets.

120
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:45,769
Right this way.

121
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:50,644
Hello. Hi, welcome. This way.

122
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:54,038
Alice, welcome to Wonderland.
You look divine.

123
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:56,693
Cute. Let's get you a drink and
over to the blackjack table.

124
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:59,696
Oh, I'm not here
to drink or gamble, Veronica.

125
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,481
I'm here to sniff out evil.

126
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:05,093
In that case, how about we
seat you close to the stage

127
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:07,182
and get you
a cranberry spritzer?

128
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:09,010
You'll want a prime seat
for the floorshow.

129
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:30,205
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
intrude, but are you Kevin Keller?

130
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:32,512
In the flesh.

131
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,165
Ah, I thought it was you.

132
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,472
I caught a performance of yours
in New York

133
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,429
a few years back.

134
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:39,519
You were terrific.

135
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,172
You should be on Broadway.

136
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,216
Or Vegas.

137
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:45,307
Yeah. Fat chance.

138
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,091
I don't even have an agent.

139
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,179
That's absurd.

140
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:52,836
What if I say that I could
make that happen for you?

141
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,754
Fame, money, being a star.

142
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:02,150
Why don't I give you a taste? Then
we can discuss the finer details.

00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:12,552

You are going to be finishing your
engagement here at the Babylonium.

150

Then you're off to New York
for your sixweek run

151
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:39,709
of the Boy from Oz
opposite Hugh Jackman.

Hi, friend.

173
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:15,979
You might not be aware, but tonight
Babylonium is by invitation only.

174
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,938

Yes, I know. I'm an investor.

176
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:22,638
No.

177
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,466
I know all of our investors.

178
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:28,035
Louis Cypher. I made my investment
with your partner, Reggie.

179
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:30,211
Where is he, I wonder.

180
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:31,865
It doesn't matter.

181
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:35,259
You're dealing with me now, and
I'm shutting this table down.

182
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,134
That's no problem.

183
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:43,050
There's plenty more for me
to do in town.

184
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:47,054
I'll get my due here
at midnight on Saturday.

185
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,491
And what's your due?

186
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,101
Oh, not much.

187
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,276
A soul.

188
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,850
Ah, I see.

189
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:05,986
Louis Cypher. Lucifer. Cute.

190
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,729
Now, I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave. Quietly.

191
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,818
Always.

192
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,256
But I'll be back on Saturday.

193
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:21,871
Reggie, there was a shark
bleeding us dry tonight.

194
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,438
Who was he?

195
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:24,700
You tell me.

196
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,007
He claimed to be an investor.

197
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:30,271
As well as the devil...

198
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:34,449
looking to claim a soul.

199
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:40,585
Ronnie, that guy is the devil.

200
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:46,069
What? When we were looking for investors,
I got an incoming call from him.

201
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:47,897
He said he could provide us
with the rest of

202
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:51,945
the money we needed
in exchange for... a soul.

203
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,600
My soul.

204
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:59,082
And he's here to collect it
this Saturday night at midnight.

205
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:00,605
You've got to help me.

206
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:04,871
If anyone can outwit
the devil, Ronnie, it's you.

207
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,527
Well, you're right about that.

208
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:15,882
Okay. I'm gonna
think of something.

209
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:21,191
But in the meantime, do you
have his number by any chance?

210
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:27,328
I'm happy to see you again, Betty.
It's being too long.

211
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:30,505
But don't you want
to see my real face?

212
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:33,943
This is your real face.

213
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:38,252
But if you mean your human face,
that will come soon enough.

214
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:41,864
My boss wants a
confession from you. Hmm.

215
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:46,913
He wants you to admit to all of
the atrocious things in here.

216
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:49,176
That's what your boss wants.

217
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:51,569
But what do you want, Betty?

218
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:55,791
I don't give a damn
about a confession.

219
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,880
I know you did these things.

220
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:01,928
I just want to know...
does evil,

221
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:07,890
absolute evil... exist?

222
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:11,111
And are you it?

223
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:14,027
Ask your real question, Betty,

224
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,508
and then I will confess my sins.

225
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:21,164
I don't have to play
these mind games with you.

226
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,169
No one cares that you're here.

227
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:30,913
So you can sit in your filth
for all I care.

228
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,915
And I'll just
come back tomorrow.

229
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:41,924
Yes, Betty,
absolute evil exists.

230
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:45,014
And yes, there's a part of you

231
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:51,499
that is absolutely 100% evil.

232
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:57,418
You're caked in it. It's
what draws us to each other.

233
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,695
You've got to get this guy
out of Rivervale, Glen.

234
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:16,741
I'm not getting
any information out of him.

235
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:21,572
Uh, he's toying with me, and I
just won't be his plaything again.

236
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:24,662
Betty, what in God's name
are you talking about?

237
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:25,750
Who's toying with you?

238
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,752
TBK, Glen.

239
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:32,322
Or is there another serial killer in
custody that you want me to interview?

240
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:37,588
Betty, the Trash Bag Killer
is not in custody.

241
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,634
Hey, are you okay? Do...

242
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:41,637
Do I need to come up to
Rivervale and check on you?

243
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,247
I'll call you back, Glen.

244
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,563
Grandpa, you're awake.

245
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,609
Did you see him?

246
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:01,612
Yes.

247
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:04,224
But I'm making
a new deal with him.

248
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:07,488
Your soul
in exchange for the diner.

249
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:13,494
You... can't sell
the diner, Tabitha.

250
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:16,976
Grandpa, it's bricks
and plaster.

251
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,979
It's so much more
than that, honey.

252
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:26,289
Over the years, it's become a
refuge for the lost and persecuted.

253
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,944
That's why the devil wants it.

254
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:36,691
Pops is the soul of Rivervale,
which he wants to destroy,

255
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:40,434
and that's why
you cannot let him have it.

256
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,660
Mr. Cypher.

257
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:53,229
Hi, Veronica Lodge calling
with a counter proposal.

258
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:57,451
There's an old friend of mine who
I've invited to Babylonium tonight,

259
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:59,496
and I suspect
you'll find his soul

260
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,325
much more deserving
of damnation than Reggie's.

261
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:04,458
Color me intrigued, Ms. Lodge.

262
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,025
I'll see you tonight.

263
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,250
Are you surprised that I
called you here, Mr. Cypher?

264
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:17,123
Nothing surprises me
these days, Mr. Jones.

265
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:21,127
I've been looking for something
to inspire my writing,

266
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,826
to get my
creative juices flowing.

267
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,978
And I figured an interview with
the devil would do just that,

268
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:30,049
but I'm... I'm... I'm not
gonna sell my soul for it.

269
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,354
Okay?

270
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:32,573
I see.

271
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:37,186
Well, huh,
I'll grant you this exclusive

272
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,407
if you agree
to one of these terms.

273
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,063
We do the interview,
you publish it,

274
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:48,763
you receive all the fame
and notoriety we all yearn for.

275
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,200
But afterwards,

276
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,854
you'll never be able
to write again.

277
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:55,944
Or?

278
00:17:55,987 --> 00:18:01,776
Or I'll give you this raw,
mindblowing tellall,

279
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:05,127
but everything I say
remains between us.

280
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:06,607
You can't publish a word.

281
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,280
In fact, you may never
publish anything again,

282
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:11,307
but you'll find
your creative juices

283
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:13,440
flowing like Niagara Falls.

284
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,574
I agree to your terms.

285
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:19,422
I only ask that you allow me
to choose my option

286
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:20,795
after we conclude the interview.

287
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:23,232
That seems fair.

288
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,415
Please start at the beginning.

289
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,164
He's here, Ronnie.

290
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:50,607
Nick St. Clair. All grown up,
but still a sleazeball.

291
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:53,306
We'll just let him get nice
and liquored up first.

292
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:01,705
And there you have it,
the story of my life

293
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:06,449
and all the universe's
mysteries revealed.

294
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,845
So, what'll it be?

295
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:16,285
Publish and never write again,
or file it away forever

296
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:22,248
and happily scribble away in
obscurity for the rest of your days?

297
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:26,861
Option one. I need
to publish this interview.

298
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:30,169
And receive all the fame and
glory that will come from it.

299
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:33,215
Fabulous.

300
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:36,087
Darling Nicky, you made it.

301
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:37,915
Of course.

302
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,439
You know I could never turn down
an invitation from you, Ronnie.

303
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,965
Even though
I am happily married.

304
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:50,711
Remember, Senator, what happens in
Babylonium... stays in Babylonium.

305
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,062
So, catch me up, Nicky.

306
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:55,542
It's been years.

307
00:19:56,978 --> 00:20:00,199
I'm assuming you're still
a very naughty boy.

308
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,723
I plead the Fifth.

309
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:04,855
Come on, Nicky.

310
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:07,249
Don't get shy on me.

311
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:09,730
What can I say?

312
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:14,387
Details are a turnon for me.

313
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:18,913
The more specific you are, the
more hot and bothered I get.

314
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:25,876
Well, in that case,
I haven't paid taxes in years.

315
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,270
And I drink and drive
two to three times a week.

316
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,359
Any hitandruns?

317
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,535
Three.

318
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:34,233
All covered up.
What about harassment?

319
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:37,105
Oh, I've lost count of how many
NDAs my lawyers have arranged

320
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:39,629
for my staff and interns.

321
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:40,674
Affairs?

322
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:44,373
You mean, besides the one
I'm about to start with you?

323
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:48,986
Cutting to the chase, would you say that
you deserve the hot burning fires of hell?

324
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,032
As long as
you're holding the pitchfork.

325
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:53,687
Would you sell your soul
to the devil for me?

326
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:57,299
Whatever it takes.

327
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,042
Is that good enough?

328
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:03,697
Is what good enough?

329
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,135
Yes.

330
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:08,571
In this instance,

331
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,617
that qualifies
as a verbal binding agreement.

332
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:15,448
Goodbye, Senator.

333
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:20,453
I'm glad our deal
worked out, Mr. Cypher.

334
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:24,761
Indeed. I will not touch
a hair on Reginald's head.

335
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,805
But you and I are still on
for tomorrow, of course.

336
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:30,289
What do you mean?

337
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:32,334
Our business is done.

338
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:34,641
Reginald's soul
was never on the table,

339
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:36,425
it was your soul
that I was promised.

340
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:38,906
Mine?

341
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:41,212
How is that possible?

342
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,998
Hmm. You might want to ask
your partner that question.

343
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:57,838
Publish...

344
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:01,494
or perish?

345
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,122
New question.

346
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:22,950
Who are you?

347
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:25,518
Because you're sure as hell
not TBK.

348
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:28,695
I'm the devil, Betty.

349
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:33,569
Okay. So if evil exists,

350
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:36,355
and you're the devil... Mmm.

351
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,531
Hell is a real place then?

352
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:41,447
Oh, yes.

353
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,840
Well, tell me, is my dad there?

354
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:45,059
He is.

355
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,063
So, if I asked you
to prove to me

356
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:51,370
that what you're saying
is true...

357
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:56,026
could I speak to my father?

358
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:06,254
Betty?

359
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:08,343
Betty, what's happening? Dad.

360
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,258
Betty, where am I?

361
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:11,868
You have to get me out of here.

362
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:13,783
Betty, it hurts.
It hurts so bad!

363
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:16,873
If it's really you, Dad,
I need you to focus, okay?

364
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:22,183
Where would you always take me
after my Little League games?

365
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:23,489
You... you...

366
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:26,100
you mean Chaz E. Cheddar's
on Route 18?

367
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:34,151
Reggie!

368
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:35,935
Oh, crap.

369
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,506
I want the truth, Reginald.

370
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,116
Now. Okay.

371
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,467
I offered my soul to Mr. Cypher
and he didn't want it.

372
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,904
He said it was
a miserable, paltry thing.

373
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:48,992
It is.

374
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:51,168
So, then you
offered mine instead?

375
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,561
He asked for it.

376
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:54,171
He said yours would be
the real prize.

377
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:57,261
Oh, my God. So you sold me
down the River Styx?

378
00:23:57,305 --> 00:24:00,917
How did this happen?
I didn't even sign a contract.

379
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:05,313
You know those, uh,
weekly invoices you sign?

380
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:06,793
I slipped a contract

381
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:09,665
in one of those stacks

382
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:13,800
and gave you Mr. Cypher's pen
to use.

383
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,935
Ronnie, I'm sorry. Forgive me.

384
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:21,634
I only agreed to it because I
knew you'd figure a way out.

385
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,158
Get out

386
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:25,768
of my sight.

387
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:27,204
You've done enough.

388
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:32,209
Out! Now!

389
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,009
Mr. Cypher.

390
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:51,185
Ms. Lodge.

391
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:52,491
So, listen.

392
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:56,625
I might be open
to a renegotiation.

393
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:59,715
A soul in exchange for yours.

394
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,023
But not another of those
Nick St. Clair types.

395
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:05,721
What about that

396
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:08,507
holy roller that's
trying to shut you down?

397
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:10,552
Alice?

398
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,598
You get me her signature

399
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,514
using my pen,

400
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:16,819
and I'll release your soul.

401
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:21,955
Otherwise, you and I
have a date at midnight.

402
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:33,836
Hello?

403
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,925
Is this
Forsythe Pendleton Jones III?

404
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:37,753
Yeah.

405
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:39,296
Hi. David Fenwick
with The Associated Press.

406
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,017
We read your
interview with the devil.

407
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:43,106
It's incredible.
We'd love to pick it up.

408
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,674
The entire world needs
to read what you wrote.

409
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:47,633
So, after the AP picked up
my story,

410
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:50,113
my phone wouldn't stop ringing.

411
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:52,420
Hang on, let me call you back.

412
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:53,856
I even got a call from...

413
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:58,034
Samm?
Kid, your article's amazing.

414
00:25:58,078 --> 00:26:00,384
I never should have dropped you
as a client. I apologize.

415
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:03,866
But will you please
let me be your agent again?

416
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,520
Before you answer, hear me out.

417
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,609
I've been in touch
with the Pulitzer people.

418
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,393
Now, because I'm me,
I gotta ask.

419
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,570
What are you writing next?

420
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:18,577
Oh. Mr. Hubbard.

421
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,361
Hi.

422
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:21,667
What can I get you?

423
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,277
I don't have any money.
But I thought,

424
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,106
in exchange for a bowl of soup,
I could wash some dishes.

425
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:30,240
You do not need
to wash any dishes.

426
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:31,894
Just have a seat.

427
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:34,331
I will bring you a bowl of soup.

428
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,942
Bless you. Thank you

429
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,511
That was very kind of you.

430
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:41,904
Oh, well,

431
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:44,907
that's just what we do
here at Pop's.

432
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:46,648
Yes.

433
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:49,129
Even when facing
the direst of circumstances,

434
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:51,914
you show compassion
and kindness.

435
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:54,700
Such a virtue should be
rewarded, don't you think?

436
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:58,225
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

437
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:02,708
I'm a great admirer of your
grandfather and all his good deeds.

438
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:06,320
Forgive me.
I don't quite understand.

439
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:09,845
You might say
I'm one of the good guys.

440
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:14,284
My name is Rafael.

441
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:16,460
And my boss

442
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:19,289
likes what you and your family
are doing here.

443
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,553
And He wants to make sure you're
prepared for a battle that's coming.

444
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:25,165
One in which your diner
will play an important role.

445
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:29,343
He wanted you to have this.

446
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:38,047
Alice.

447
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:40,833
Thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

448
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:42,312
I know how busy you are.

449
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:44,227
I am.

450
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:46,403
But you said
you had an offer for me.

451
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:47,753
I do.

452
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,711
I want to donate

453
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:54,324
a percentage of Babylonium's weekly
earnings to the town of Rivervale.

454
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:57,371
To be allocated
at your discretion.

455
00:27:58,851 --> 00:28:00,374
My discretion?

456
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:04,160
I want you to be my pointperson
on this, discreetly.

457
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:07,947
And I have a direct
deposit here ready to sign,

458
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,951
if this sounds
at all amenable to you.

459
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,998
As a matter of fact, it does.

460
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:22,439
You know, I knew you weren't
all bad, Veronica.

461
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:30,665
Alice, stop!

462
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,145
What? What's wrong?

463
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:34,408
What's wrong...

464
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:36,889
is that...

465
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,108
you're a pain in the ass.

466
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:42,764
But you don't deserve
to burn in hell.

467
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:45,462
I've changed my mind.

468
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,378
Leave.

469
00:28:48,422 --> 00:28:51,860
If you thought that I was
a thorn in your side before,

470
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:54,123
get ready
for what's coming next.

471
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:07,528
It was...

472
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:13,186
a dark and stormy night.

473
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:22,195
Who knew the devil
would be so literal?

474
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:24,414
Back for more, Betty?

475
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:30,899
If you're the devil... Mmm.

476
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:34,598
And you've come to me, it's
because you want something from me.

477
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:35,904
So what is it?

478
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:37,906
Your loyalty.

479
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,169
There is a war brewing, Betty.

480
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:42,955
The one between good and evil.

481
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:45,087
Pledge your allegiance to me

482
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:48,830
and I'll release your father
from endless suffering.

483
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,876
Why do you need me?

484
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:53,356
Because it is foretold.

485
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,621
"I saw a woman sit upon
a scarletcolored beast,"

486
00:29:57,665 --> 00:30:02,148
full of blasphemy, and that
woman was Babylon the Great,

487
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:05,847
"mother of all destruction
and abomination."

488
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:09,198
You are that woman, Betty.

489
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:11,418
Really?

490
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:14,987
I'm the whore of Babylon
from the Book of Revelation?

491
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:19,469
I don't think so.

492
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:24,518
And as for my
father's suffering,

493
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:26,650
I don't care about it.

494
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:29,044
What if I told you

495
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:31,177
Polly's in hell, too?

496
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:34,484
Uh...

497
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,313
I wouldn't believe you

498
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:39,098
because Polly doesn't deserve
to be there.

499
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:40,969
Doesn't she though?

500
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,496
Betty.

501
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,499
Betty, make it stop!
It burns, Betty!

502
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:51,545
It burns so, so much!

503
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:52,981
My skin! My skin...

504
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:54,200
Betty, it's coming off.

505
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:55,984
Everything hurts so much.
Stop it.

506
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:59,509
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop torturing her!

507
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:00,554
Stop it!

508
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,206
And let me guess.

509
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:48,167
The face of evil is mine, right?

510
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:02,616
Glen?

511
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:07,099
Yes, it's Glen.

512
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:11,016
And when I called him
using your voice,

513
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,365
saying I needed him...

514
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:17,457
well, he couldn't come
any faster.

515
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,634
He must've
really cared about you.

516
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:28,207
Hey, Ronnie,
sorry to bother you.

517
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,427
I know you've got
a lot on your plate...

518
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:36,084
but the weekly skim guys
are here to collect their cut.

519
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:38,043
Um...

520
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:39,609
do you want me to handle it?

521
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:41,568
Actually, no.

522
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,875
Let them in.

523
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:46,486
I want to thank them personally.

524
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:48,096
For what?

525
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,446
For giving me...

526
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:53,232
a hope in hell.

527
00:32:53,275 --> 00:32:55,147
Oh, and tell Kevin
to take the night off.

528
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,497
I'll be delivering
our eleven o'clock number.

529
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:00,630
My swansong.

530
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:02,981
Ending right at
the stroke of midnight.

531
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:13,469
You called me, Mr. Jones.
I came.

532
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:14,818
What seems to be the problem?

533
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:16,646
I don't want it.

534
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,866
I don't want it.
I don't want the Pulitzer.

535
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:20,887
I... I don't want the fame. I don't
want the fortune. Please, take it back.

536
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:23,697
Please, take it back. I need
to be able to write again.

537
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,220
Of course.

538
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:26,743
I understand.

539
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:29,659
And I could do that.

540
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:32,184
But it would cost you.

541
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:34,360
My soul, right?

542
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:38,406
Take it.

543
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,061
Take it.

544
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,024

I was so pleased to hear that
you'd accepted my offer, Tabitha.

00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:04,058
And how nice to see you
on the mend, Terrence.

560
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,190
I wanted him here.

561
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:06,495
Well...

562
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,107
we all need to sign anyway.

563
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,546
But before we do,

564
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:16,418
I want to make sure that
this contract is ironclad.

565
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:17,724
And that after we sign,

566
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:20,683
my grandfather's soul
is free and clear

567
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:22,946

00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,429
Terrence,

570
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:28,865
will you get us started?

571
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:40,225
What will you do with Pop's now?

572
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:42,357
The bulldozers will
be here in the morning.

573
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:46,535
If this is Pop's last night,

574
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:49,712
then I want a milkshake
to remember it by.

575
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,758
Delightful idea.

576
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:52,933

580
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:26,009
How does it taste?

581
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:28,882
Now that you mention it,
the flavor is a little...

582
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:30,797
off.

583
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,102
Oh. Well, yeah.

584
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:35,149
That would be
the secret ingredient I added.

585
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,672
What secret ingredient?

586
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:39,936
Tears that the Virgin Mary shed
at the Crucifixion.

587
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:52,993
Where did you get that?

588
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:54,864
My guardian angel.

589
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:56,953
And since we have consumed
the tears as well,

590
00:36:56,997 --> 00:37:00,348
we are now protected
by their holy properties.

591
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:01,349

592
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:05,353
Oh, yes. About that...

593

From this moment on,
Pop's is consecrated.

00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:20,412
Protected from you
and any other force of evil.

00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:42,189
Hello, Agent Cooper?

606
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:44,365
This is Foster
from Agent Scot's office.

607
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:46,367
Have you heard
from Glen recently?

608
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:49,979
His wife reported him missing,
and no one can get a hold of him.

609
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:52,155
No, I haven't heard from him.

610
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,896
But I'll give you a call
if I do.

611
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:56,421
Hope he's okay.

00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:10,565

00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,875
Veronica?

614
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:16,963
You're still here?

615
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,228
But it's after midnight.

616
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:23,709
What happened? Well...

617
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:28,148
after I finished my number,
to wild applause, might I add,

618
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:33,675
I went to the cash room
to meet with Mr. Cypher. And...

619
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,416
we brokered a better deal.

620
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,463
That's amazing.
What kind of deal?

621
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:41,379
Let's just say

622
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:45,426
the devil will be joining
our little skim at the casino.

623
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,255
Only instead of collecting cash,

624
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:50,126
I'll be his expediter,

625
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,782
supplying him with one lost
soul from our floor each week

626
00:39:53,826 --> 00:39:56,002
for the rest of my natural life.

627
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:59,048
You're a genius, Ronnie.
You did it.

628
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:01,747
You beat the devil.

629
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,879
Did you expect anything less?

630
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:11,409
You should get that, Reggie.

631
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,976
I think it's for you.

632
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,110
Who is it?

633
00:40:17,153 --> 00:40:18,764
You know who it is.

634
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:22,550
His weekly skim begins tonight.

635
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:23,682
Or actually...

636
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:26,554
Sunday morning.

637
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:31,472
But You shouldn't have
doublecrossed me, Reggie.

638
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:34,867
And you should have been more
careful about what pen you use

639
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,912
when signing
for liquor deliveries.

640
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:41,613
As you did earlier today.

641
00:40:42,918 --> 00:40:44,093
No.

642
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:47,445
Go on, Reggie.

643
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:50,622
Be a man about it.

644
00:40:50,665 --> 00:40:53,755
Or he'll drag you out
kicking and screaming

645
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:55,540
like a little bitch.

646
00:41:11,904 --> 00:41:16,648
For people like Veronica Lodge,
this is their lot in life.

647
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:22,828
Living bet to bet,
skim to skim, scam to scam.

648
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,657
Always chasing
that next best deal.

649
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:34,492
And so what if it costs
a few hundred

650
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:37,538
or a thousand souls
along the way?

651
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:40,759
Because if Rivervale
really is going to be

652
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:44,153
the final battleground
between good and evil...

653
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:47,069
is anybody's soul safe?
