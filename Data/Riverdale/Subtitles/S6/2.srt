1
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:06,571
Gather around, kiddies.

2
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:07,790
It's time for a ghost story.

3
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,835
No, a few ghost stories,
actually.

4
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:14,362
The first begins with a conflict
as ancient as Cain and Abel.

5
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:17,843
For as long as the Serpents have
existed, so too have the Ghoulies.

6
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:21,151
Over the years, they fought
for a myriad of reasons.

7
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:26,983
Tonight they're rumbling
because Serpent Princess Xandra

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,247
fell in love with
the Ghoulie Prince, Daniel.

9
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:34,643
And in a town like Rivervale, that is more
than enough reason to spill some blood.

10
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:54,445
♪ We all fall down

11
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:02,104
Dan!

12
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,775
What haunts me is that I was
aiming to wound, not kill.

13
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:23,126
And I couldn't have possibly
known that Darla's son, Danny,

14
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,086
was gonna jump in front of her
like that.

15
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:28,088
Still...

16
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,003
Thanks.

17
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:34,224
The boy's mother,
Darla Dickenson,

18
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:37,619
- have you thought about reaching out to her?
- To apologize?

19
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:43,015
I mean, she's a mother who
lost her son, Doctor, really,

20
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,322
there's nothing I could say
to comfort her.

21
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:49,413
I know that I wouldn't
be able to live anymore

22
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:51,850
if something bad were to happen
to Baby Anthony.

23
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:55,463
I had a reason
for inviting each guest.

24
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:56,701
Good luck
with your writing today.

25
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:57,856
Thanks.

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,902
Good luck feeding the masses.

27
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:01,445
Oh, and don't forget
to hang up these pictures.

28
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,210
Consider it done.

29
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:05,168
They share
one thing, they all need money.

30
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:16,397
Mantle Motors.

31
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,313
Hey, I'm just checking in to see
if there's any word on your dad.

32
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:21,663
It's not so good.

33
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:25,101
The nurse said he's having a bad day and
I shouldn't visit him at the hospital.

34
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:30,454
You know, Reggie, it's okay for you
to be upset about your dad being sick.

35
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:32,935
What kills me
is that we were doing better.

36
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:35,764
I just thought
we'd have more time.

37
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:41,987
Thanks for calling, Ronnie.
I'll see you when I get home.

38
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:44,207
Okay.

39
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,251
See you in a bit.

40
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,702
- Holy crap.
- Oh...

41
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:03,966
I had a car exactly like
this one back in high school.

42
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:05,663
Man, the times we had.

43
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:08,231
She's a beaut, isn't she?

44
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:10,320
I was hoping to get her
appraised and sold.

45
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,061
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

46
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:14,237
I'll buy it off of you.
Double the Blue Book value.

47
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:16,500
All cash.

48
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:40,959
Just like old times.

49
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:42,744
I've missed you, Bellissima.

50
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:54,146
♪ Feel real, feel real

51
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:59,848
♪ Feel real, feel real

52
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:05,984
♪ Feel real, feel real

53
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:15,298
- Ronnie?
- -Hey, don't mean to be a new noodge,

54
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,692
but I was getting worried.
Is everything okay?

55
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:20,477
Yeah, I just got caught
doing some paperwork.

56
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,566
I'm about to head out
the door now.

57
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,481
No worries, lover. See you soon.

58
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:32,228
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

59
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:40,280
What happened to hanging up
the art today?

60
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,673
I'm sorry. I'll do it tomorrow, love.
I promise.

61
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,591
You know what? It's, um...

62
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:49,332
It's all good.

63
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:50,376
Okay.

64
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,425
Okay.

65
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,391
Oh, my God.

66
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:07,002
Jeez, Tabs.

67
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:09,918
I thought my walls in New York
were paper thin.

68
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,747
Wait. Do you feel that?

69
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,792
Yeah.

70
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:16,359
I think there's
a draft coming through.

71
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:17,969
I think there's
something in there.

72
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,015
On the other side.

73
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,500
Whoa!

74
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:30,765
What the hell is this place?

75
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:36,161
Are these Scotch bottles?

76
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:37,641
Isn't that what you used
to drink?

77
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:39,643
Yeah, when I could afford it.

78
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:42,037
But why would this place
have been covered up?

79
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,431
I don't know, but I should put
my writing desk in here

80
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:45,973
and turn this into
a little writing nook.

81
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:47,172
Wouldn't that be cool?

82
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:54,832
Hey.

83
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:58,401
Reggie?

84
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,708
I'm sorry, I stink.
I'm gonna take a shower.

85
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:29,084
So, Nana, you'll be thrilled.

86
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:30,607
I was out
in the Maple Groves today,

87
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:33,088
and the trees are
positively bursting with sap.

88
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:34,872
They practically drenched me.

89
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:39,007
- In fact, I infused our brandies with some.
- Mm.

90
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,835
- To Archie.
- To Archie.

91
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:44,404
Auntie Cheryl.

92
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,449
Mommy is trying to take Juniper.

93
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,973
What are you talking about, boy child?
Where is your sister?

94
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:52,194
She's in the bathroom, splashing,
and she won't open the door.

95
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:57,982
Juniper, open the door.

96
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:05,555
Juniper, open the door!

97
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,827
Juniper, Juniper.

98
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:19,395
- Mama.
- Come here. Are you okay?

99
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,658
Okay. You're okay.

100
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,803
So, are you thinking
about any names?

101
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,979
It's still early days, Kev.

102
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:41,591
- But if it's a boy, Archie.
- Obviously.

103
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:46,378
And, uh, if it's a girl, I was
thinking maybe Polly would be nice.

104
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:49,643
Cousin, I need your mother to take
the twins for a couple of days.

105
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:51,688
Okay. Why?

106
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,753
Because some evil water nymph out of an M.
Night Shyamalan movie

107
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:56,301
is stalking the halls of
Thornhill and threatening them.

108
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:57,912
Will you let Alice know
or shall I?

109
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:02,351
Uh...

110
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,135
Okay, so there is a closet

111
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,834
in the original floor plan
of this apartment.

112
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:09,924
Hmm. Isn't that curious?

113
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:14,363
Miss Gordon, is there something
that you're not telling me?

114
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:18,367
Don't you legally have to disclose any
bad things that have happened there?

115
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,543
I did. To your boyfriend.

116
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,110
Okay.

117
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:24,155
And what exactly
did you disclose?

118
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,071
About Sam and Diane.

119
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:29,160
The young couple
who died in the apartment.

120
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:33,513
I'm sorry, what?
Died there? How?

121
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:34,905
Murder suicide.

122
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,820
She killed him, then herself.

123
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:39,693
It was a very
unfortunate situation.

124
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,261
I'm so sorry, Mr. Schaeffer.

125
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:45,437
This is so unlike... Reggie?

126
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,528
Where are you?

127
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,442
Hey, Ronnie.
Now is not a good time.

128
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:53,663
I'm at the hospital. There
was an emergency with my dad.

129
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:57,754
Was that a school bell?

130
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:00,278
You are so busted, Mantle.

131
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:02,585
For a second, I thought you
were having a secret affair.

132
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:07,372
What is going on, Reggie? And
where did that car come from?

133
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,810
Some Joe nobody showed up
in the lot wanting to sell her.

134
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:11,986
Can you believe it?

135
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:15,729
'Course she's not the OG Bella,
but she's the same make and model.

136
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,514
That's right. Bella.

137
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,300
You know, my dad gave me her.
When he handed me those keys,

138
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:26,000
it was maybe
the greatest day of my life.

139
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:29,873
So when she came back to me,
I just wanted to...

140
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:32,267
Relive some happy memories
for a change?

141
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,139
I get that.

142
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:38,882
But why bring her here?
Why not the Pembrooke?

143
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:42,190
To be honest, I needed to do
a little fine tuning.

144
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:45,062
Give her a little TLC,
get her purring again.

145
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:47,630
Whatever you need to do, Reggie.

146
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:50,198
You don't have to sneak around.

147
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:54,506
And don't forget, I could use a
little TLC every now and again, too.

148
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,335
- I can arrange that.
- Yeah?

149
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,728
Mm-hmm.

150
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:04,081
In fact... I have a crazy idea.

151
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:07,607
It's cool, right?

152
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,479
I decided to go for
a nautical Neil Gaiman theme.

153
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:13,917
Okay, so you didn't have time
to hang up our pictures,

154
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:18,661
but you did have time to put up
a door on your new nook. Huh?

155
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:22,404
Also, why didn't you tell me
the truth about this place?

156
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:25,842
- What truth?
- About Sam and Diane,

157
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:28,889
the murder-suicide couple.

158
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,215
Because when you saw the apartment,
you fell in love with it.

159
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:35,678
Also, I, I know this is gonna
sound weird, but I thought,

160
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,767
maybe I could write about them.

161
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:40,640
I've been doing some digging, and
it's a pretty fascinating story.

162
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,383
He was a painter,
obsessed with his work.

163
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:48,648
She bludgeoned him to death with
a hammer and then hung herself.

164
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,954
Why'd she do that?

165
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:53,304
No one knows for certain. She
just sort of snapped one day.

166
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,438
How completely ghoulish.

167
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:59,528
I know.
It's an unsettling story.

168
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:01,661
That's why I didn't want
to tell you.

169
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:05,882
I'm not upset about something
that happened 50 years ago,

170
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,276
as disturbing as it is, Jughead.

171
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:12,802
I'm upset that you chose
to hide something from me.

172
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:17,067
I should've told you. I'm not gonna
do something like that ever again.

173
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:20,027
- And if you're worried about the ghosts...
- I'm not.

174
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:22,290
And on the plus side...

175
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:25,772
I'm feeling kind of inspired.

176
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,425
Are you writing again?

177
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,038
No, but I'm getting close.

178
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:35,999
Hey, Toni. Um, I need your help.

179
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,436
Sure, Betty. What's up?

180
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,177
Um, I'm here about a case.

181
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:43,093
An incident
of domestic violence.

182
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,748
Looks like a mother drowned
her daughter in a bathtub.

183
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,837
And, Toni, she's a Serpent.

184
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,317
Her name's Lucinda Villa.

185
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,623
- Her daughter is...
- Sandra.

186
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,451
But she's 16.

187
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:55,932
Drowned how?

188
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:59,588
Dr. Curdle said that there were bruises on
her shoulders, like someone held her under.

189
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:02,417
So the FBI wants me to charge
her mother with murder.

190
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,941
No, I know Lucinda.

191
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:06,856
She'd never hurt her daughter.

192
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,859
Well, she's not talking to me,
so maybe she would talk to you.

193
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,428
Okay.

194
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:16,126
Lucinda, I know
you didn't drown your daughter.

195
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,911
You loved her
with all your heart.

196
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:21,653
But you were you the only
one home when it happened.

197
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:25,266
Who did this to Sandra?

198
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,051
It was...

199
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,185
La Llorona.

200
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:34,536
"La Llorona"?

201
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,712
Who or what is La Llorona?

202
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,453
According to the old folk tales,

203
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:41,021
it's a spirit of vengeance
who preys on young children.

204
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,153
She drowns them.

205
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:47,201
Okay, Toni,
I appreciate your help,

206
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:49,396
and I want to give Lucinda
the benefit of the doubt here,

207
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,381
but I can't put "spirit of
vengeance" on my report.

208
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:58,778
♪ Whoa, my love ♪

209
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,259
♪ My darling

210
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:10,006
♪ I've hungered For your touch ♪

211
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:16,578
♪ A long, lonely time

212
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:20,451
Dear God, Reggie,
those are my students.

213
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,149
Okay, that's it. We're done.

214
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,368
- I've indulged you long enough.
- What about dinner?

215
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:25,630
We're taking it to go.

216
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,329
Now.

217
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:51,134
Jughead, can you keep it down?

218
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:54,616
Jughead, can you just
please stop for a second?

219
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,860
Jughead?

220
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,341
Hmm.

221
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:27,016
How many times have I told you not
to leave the toothpaste uncapped?

222
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,824
Uh, it wasn't me.

223
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,260
Yet it was uncapped.

224
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,134
I don't know.
Maybe, it was the ghost

225
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:36,484
that you heard banging
in the closet.

226
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:39,052
You know, when you woke me up
in the middle of the night.

227
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,792
I don't need any attitude
right now.

228
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:43,665
Please, just put the toothpaste
cap back on the tube.

229
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,796
It's common decency.

230
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:53,326
Reggie,

231
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:57,244
I think we should
talk about last night.

232
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:58,854
It was really
uncomfortable for me.

233
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,508
What?

234
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,431
You're telling me you've
never made out in a car?

235
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,642
Of course I have.

236
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:07,732
But last time that happened, Chuck
Clayton tried to tarnish my good name,

237
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:11,301
so maybe that's why canoodling
in your stupid car triggered me.

238
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:14,043
First of all,
Bella's not stupid.

239
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,785
Second of all,
you've got kinks too,

240
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:19,919
like making out on a bed
full of dirty $100 bills.

241
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,269
That was in the privacy
of our own home,

242
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:25,228
not plastered on the leather
seats of some stupid ride.

243
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:29,102
Okay, that's the second time
you've called my car stupid.

244
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:33,193
Veronica, are you jealous
of Bella or something?

245
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:34,759
Don't be ridiculous.

246
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:39,286
Fine. No more carscapades.

247
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:40,504
Great.

248
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,035
You okay, Tabitha?

249
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,647
That's the third plate
you dropped today.

250
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,693
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

251
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:58,435
I just... haven't been
sleeping well.

252
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,134
Any reason in particular?

253
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:06,443
Grandpa, you don't believe
in ghosts, do you?

254
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:09,011
Sure, I do.

255
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:13,146
This diner was haunted for a
while by the ghost of a waitress

256
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:15,887
who died in an accident
with a deep fryer.

257
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:20,936
When we opened back up a couple of days
later, strange things began to happen.

258
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,287
The jukebox would start
playing on its own.

259
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:26,333
Pots and pans
would fall off hooks.

260
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,465
How did you get it to stop?

261
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:33,209
Remember we had those riots
in the 1980s,

262
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:37,126
when every window was broken?

263
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:42,566
Well, after that night we
didn't have another incident.

264
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:48,616
It was almost as if the racket
scared the ghost off.

265
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,403
I guess the dead can be as
afraid of us as we are of them.

266
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:57,581
Well, from what you're telling
me, it's clear as day, hermanita.

267
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,193
Reggie's going
through a quarter-life crisis.

268
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:03,761
Actually, the timing of a
quarter-life crisis does make sense.

269
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,154
- Mm.
- Especially considering

270
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:06,634
what's happening
with Reggie's dad.

271
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,940
My advice,
cut Reggie some slack.

272
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:10,594
Let him play with his toys,

273
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:12,857
hell, get him some fuzzy dice.

274
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:15,208
Maybe you're right, hermosa.

275
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:17,906
I mean, it's not like I'm
actually jealous of Bella.

276
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:35,010
Hey, Betty.

277
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,143
I'm just calling
to check in on Lucinda.

278
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:38,840
How's she doing?

279
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:42,583
She's still sticking
to her story about La Llorona.

280
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,498
I know this sounds crazy,

281
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,822
but is there any universe in
which she's telling the truth?

282
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,286
I've been doing
lots of research,

283
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,203
and ghosts like La Llorona
exist in different cultures.

284
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:57,772
They're spirits of
unfettered feral motherhood.

285
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:00,601
And look, there's different
versions of the legend,

286
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:05,040
but they're always mothers, and
they always go after children.

287
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:10,611
I even read one article where a La
Llorona can go after an unborn child.

288
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:13,483
Okay, Toni, that's enough, okay?

289
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:16,486
I'm sorry, but your friend is
going to be charged for murder.

290
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,053
Betty, you need to listen to me.

291
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,840
Something very bad
is happening in Rivervale.

292
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:27,149
And I don't think any of our
children are safe until it's over.

293
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:29,543
So it took me all day,
but I finally figured out

294
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:31,806
how they get the ship
in the bottle.

295
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:35,462
Um, were you seriously
doing this all day?

296
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:38,639
Uh, yeah, I kind of
got fixated on it.

297
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,684
Jughead, I thought you were
going to be writing.

298
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,164
That was our deal.

299
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,252
No, I get it.

300
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:45,167
This is just my process.

301
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,648
I'm refilling the well
of my creative subconscious.

302
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,781
And what about these bottles?

303
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:54,089
What happened to the Scotch
that was in them?

304
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:56,657
Nothing.

305
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,573
Tabitha, I picked those
bottles up behind Whyte Wyrm.

306
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,966
Hey, I'm not drinking again.
I promise.

307
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:06,101
I think I... I know I'm ready
to start writing again, okay?

308
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:09,756
Okay.

309
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:03,637
God...

310
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:11,297
Seriously?

311
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:25,180
It worked.

312
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,226
- What did?
- My process.

313
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,247
I've been writing all night. The
words have just been flying out.

314
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:32,840
Look, look, it's a novella.

315
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,581
It's almost finished.

316
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:37,671
Wow, that's...
That's amazing, Jughead.

317
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:38,846
When can I read it?

318
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:41,544
Uh, not just yet.

319
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:44,591
I don't really let anyone read
my vomit drafts, like ever.

320
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:47,681
But the second I revise it, you are
going to be the first one to read it.

321
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:50,205
- Okay?
- Okay. I can't wait.

322
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:55,992
You know what?

323
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,213
This is a nice car.

324
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:23,151
Reggie Mantle!

325
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:25,762
You lying cad!

326
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,333
- Oh.
- Oh.

327
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:32,378
I'm sorry.

328
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:33,509
I'm so sorry.

329
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,254
What are you doing
with a photo of Miss Soprano?

330
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,430
What? Who is Miss Soprano?

331
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,432
She was our driver's ed teacher.

332
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:45,304
That is, until the allegations.

333
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,350
Allegations?

334
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:51,266
Of inappropriate relations between
her and, uh, some of the boys.

335
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,375
What was her first name again?

336
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,183
Something Italian.

337
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,706
Isabella, if I recall correctly.

338
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,405
Oh, my God.

339
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:17,901
Keep working.
I'll just be a minute.

340
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:25,735
I know who you are.

341
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,258
And I know what you want.

342
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:33,526
Don't even think about it.

343
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:57,724
Toni! What the hell?

344
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:07,037
How curious, Miss Cooper.

345
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:11,912
According to the sonogram,
you are no longer pregnant.

346
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:12,955
What?

347
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:18,919
What are you talking about,
Dr. Curdle? I was pregnant.

348
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:20,311
You told me that I was pregnant.

349
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,052
I took a test
that said I was pregnant.

350
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:25,404
Hysterical pregnancies
can manifest the same symptoms

351
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:28,537
and conditions
as actual pregnancies.

352
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:30,844
Perhaps that's what
happened here.

353
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:36,937
Toni, I believe you now.

354
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,506
I think La Llorona
is in Rivervale.

355
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,335
I'm gonna try and help Lucinda.

356
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:45,859
Thank you.

357
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:48,427
But, Betty,
did something happen?

358
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,213
I think so.

359
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:54,302
Um, but I'll tell you
about it later, okay?

360
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,522
In the meantime, there's a
hunch that I need to pursue.

361
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:57,610
Can we meet up afterwards?

362
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,176
Absolutely. I'm here.

363
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,395
Okay. I'll call you.

364
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,744
More coffee?

365
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:03,877
- Uh, decaf, please.
- Oh, you got it

366
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:08,664
Everything okay?

367
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,840
Yes.

368
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:13,060
Just a little on edge.

369
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:15,105
How are you?
How... How's life with Jughead?

370
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:18,021
To be frank,

371
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:20,937
I had no idea living with a
writer would be so... intense.

372
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,765
Oh, yeah.

373
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,288
He could be pretty single-minded

374
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:25,855
when he got in the weeds
with a story.

375
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:27,354
But it was always
very exciting to read

376
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:30,207
those early vomit drafts
of his, you know?

377
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:32,296
Wait, Jughead
let you read his vomit drafts?

378
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,603
Yeah, all the time.

379
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:37,780
He said he wanted me to experience his
stories in their rawest form, you know?

380
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:40,566
Yeah, same with me.

381
00:24:45,614 --> 00:24:48,269
Janet, what's the occasion?

382
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:50,314
I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

383
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:53,535
but I received
an anonymous complaint.

384
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:55,842
I'm here on
a wellness check, Toni,

385
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:56,930
for Baby Anthony.

386
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:58,714
What?

387
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:02,239
Somebody thinks I'm not
taking care of my baby?

388
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:04,938
- Janet, you know me?
- I do.

389
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:06,301
But, you know,
as a social worker,

390
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,203
I have to investigate
every claim.

391
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:10,857
I don't even know what to say.

392
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:26,786
Who called Child Services?
Was it Kevin?

393
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:28,527
I can't disclose
that information.

394
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,580
Anthony!

395
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,541
It's okay.

396
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:43,584
It's okay.

397
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:47,589
It's okay. It's okay.
Mama's got you.

398
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,028
I got your text, Ronnie.
What's going on?

399
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,393
Ronnie, why?

400
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:11,918
Why'd you do this to Bella?

401
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:14,747
Because I know who Bella is.

402
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,790
The real one.

403
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:19,142
Isabella Soprano,
the sick teacher

404
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:22,493
who had inappropriate relationships
with her students, including you.

405
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:24,104
What?

406
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:26,497
I can stomach a lot, Reggie,
but I will not allow you

407
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:29,370
to romanticize
an abusive relationship.

408
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:33,113
She was an adult,
and she took advantage of you.

409
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:36,420
And this... This sick obsession
with your car

410
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:39,728
is just a continuation
of that toxic dynamic.

411
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:41,208
But we never did anything.

412
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:46,648
She was the one adult
I could trust.

413
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,215
The only one I ever told

414
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:50,739
about the abuse
that was going on in my home.

415
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:52,219
She listened to me.

416
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:53,437
She helped me.

417
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,312
Reggie...

418
00:26:58,355 --> 00:27:00,531
It's just a car.

419
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:04,535
I just got back
from the hospital

420
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:07,495
and my dad died 20 minutes ago.

421
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:09,366
Oh, my God. Reggie.

422
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:12,239
I'm so, so sorry.

423
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:14,284
I will always be here for you.

424
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:15,503
It's just you and me,

425
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:17,940
as it should be.

426
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:26,340
Toni, I found something,

427
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:28,385
a pattern, retracing her steps.

428
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:30,823
So she's following a direct
line from Sweetwater River.

429
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:33,652
First Thornhill, where Cheryl
encountered her,

430
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:37,917
then Lucinda's,
my house, Rivervale High.

431
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,483
- Now...
- This apartment.

432
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:41,442
Where she came after
Baby Anthony.

433
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:44,750
Her target was, and I bet
still is, Baby Anthony.

434
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,447
Well, how do you know?

435
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,275
Mother's intuition, I guess.

436
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:55,499
Fangs, take Baby Anthony
to the Whyte Wyrm.

437
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:57,501
And surround him
with the Serpents.

438
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,852
I don't think she'll go after
him with a crowd around.

439
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,375
Okay.

440
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:02,506
And where are you going?

441
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,726
Cheryl's.

442
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,772
We need to contact
that ghost bitch,

443
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:09,535
and she's the only person I know who
knows how to channel the spirits.

444
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:22,831
So we'll go to the funeral home tomorrow
morning to finalize arrangements.

445
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:25,791
But... everything's in order.

446
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:27,793
Thanks, Ronnie.

447
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,187
I have a surprise for you.

448
00:28:33,189 --> 00:28:37,498
I was going to wait until
things calmed down a bit,

449
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:40,675
but I think my Reggie-kins
deserves a pick-me-up.

450
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:50,729
You'll find that car key

451
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:55,124
fits into a gorgeous
1969 Camaro SS 4-speed.

452
00:28:57,083 --> 00:29:00,303
I thought you might want to take
it for a spin later tonight.

453
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:01,522
This is great.

454
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:04,003
Thanks, Ronnie.

455
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:05,395
I really appreciate it.

456
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:07,484
Reggie...

457
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:13,099
We're gonna be okay, right?

458
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:16,450
Of course.

459
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:18,495
Nothing could
ever come between us.

460
00:29:23,587 --> 00:29:26,852
Hear ye, hear ye, we sacred
women have gathered here

461
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:30,812
to summon the entity
known as La Llorona,

462
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:33,684
or the weeping woman.

463
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:36,818
Spirit, your sisters
call out to you.

464
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:40,909
You who visited this house and
the house of Elizabeth Cooper

465
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:43,129
and the house
of Antoinette Topaz.

466
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:45,522
Spirit, speak to us.

467
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:48,047
What is thy name?

468
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:51,528
Spirit, reveal thyself.

469
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:54,140
Spirit, reveal thy self.

470
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:56,359
Spirit, reveal thy self.

471
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:59,145
Spirit, reveal thy self.

472
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:01,234
Spirit, reveal thy self.

473
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:18,773
Is that the spirit?
Who are you? Name thy self?

474
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,995
My name was Martha Mallon.

475
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:26,607
My employ was as a nurse
in the children's ward

476
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,740
of Rivervale's first hospital.

477
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:35,529
In those early, hungry years, we
lost many a babe from the pox,

478
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:40,839
from the bitter cold,
from a doctor's careless hands.

479
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:45,321
The townsfolk blamed me
for the loss of their children,

480
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:47,976
accused me of being
a witch woman.

481
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,458
And they dragged me
and my own children

482
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:57,116
to the Sweetwater River,
weighed us down with rocks,

483
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:59,509
and threw us in the dark waters.

484
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:01,902
We drowned,

485
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:07,822
and I became
this cursed thing that I am.

486
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,911
Who summoned you here, spirit?

487
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:12,348
Who called you
to this earthly plane?

488
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:18,243
- What's happening?
- Do not break the circle or we'll lose contact.

489
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,269
Speak, Martha,
who summoned you here?

490
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:22,706
We have to stop, Cheryl,
she's gonna drown.

491
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,579
Not yet, we need a name.

492
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:27,624
Speak, Martha,
who summoned you here?

493
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:29,322
Who called you to this plane?

494
00:31:29,365 --> 00:31:32,107
It was Darla Dickenson,

495
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:36,372
who did so from her son's grave.

496
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,961
Nana, I'm sorry, are you all right?
Are you all right?

497
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:41,725
Forgive me.

498
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:44,076
Darla Dickenson, why does
that name sound so familiar?

499
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:46,469
She's the woman
whose son I killed.

500
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:50,865
That's why she's doing this.

501
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Tabitha?

502
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:09,231
"She doesn't understand me.

503
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:12,495
How could she? She doesn't
have an artist's soul."

504
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,454
Mmm.

505
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:18,197
You broke into my desk?

506
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,957
It's a huge breach
of privacy and my process.

507
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,331
Oh, right, right, your process.

508
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,985
Your process.

509
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,118
You mean how you sit around
all day playing with your

510
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:28,729
toy boats while
I work my ass off

511
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:31,384
so that you can write
a story about a wife

512
00:32:31,427 --> 00:32:34,953
who doesn't understand her
husband and then kills her husband

513
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:37,868
because he leaves the cap
off the freakin' toothpaste?

514
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:39,740
- Hey... Hey, hey, hey.
- Are you for real?

515
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:43,091
- Are you kidding me?
- This story is not about us.

516
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:45,137
It's about the people
who lived here before us,

517
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,312
Sam and Diane.

518
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:47,617
Oh, Sam and Diane.

519
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,315
- Also...
- Yeah, give me a break.

520
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:52,187
Also, she doesn't kill him
because of the toothpaste.

521
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:54,537
She kills him because he's
too obsessed with his work.

522
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:57,366
Ah, I'll tell you
why she kills him.

523
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,413
She kills him because she
gets sick of supporting him

524
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:03,938
while he displays a complete
disregard for her feelings.

525
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,549
Maybe that's why
she brains him with a hammer.

526
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:09,161
Oh!

527
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:11,946
What's with the Scotch that
you're allegedly not drinking?

528
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,035
I'm not!
Those are for the ships.

529
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,319
And I'm going to pour them out.

530
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:18,213
Oh.

531
00:33:18,257 --> 00:33:20,955
Let me get this straight.

532
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,741
You bought a bunch of Scotch
with money that I earned

533
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:27,657
so you could just pour it down
the drain for your stupid boats.

534
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,790
Well, you know what?
Screw your ship.

535
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,357
- Screw your...
- Hey!

536
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,144
- Tab...
- You know what, screw your writing, too.

537
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:37,667
- Don't.
- Yes!

538
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:40,018
Please, don't, don't, don't.
Don't! Don't!

539
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,410
Don't!

540
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,022
How could you?

541
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:45,371
This was a gift from Betty.

542
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:04,606
No!

543
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:08,394
We're not like them.

544
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,788
We're stronger.

545
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:17,490
We're stronger and we made a promise
that we would work through our problems.

546
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,622
And I love you...

547
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,928
Jughead, and I'm...

548
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:23,364
sorry.

549
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:25,758
I'm sorry.

550
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:28,849
Did you say, "I love you"?

551
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,719
Yeah.

552
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,508
I've been wanting to
say that for a while.

553
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:37,597
Yeah. I've been
wanting to say it, too.

554
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,167
I love you.

555
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:56,441
Was that...

556
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:02,317
What, the ghost leaving?
Are ghosts real now?

557
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:06,495
I think maybe they are.

558
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:09,803
And I think maybe...

559
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,458
we scared them away.

560
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:16,243
Finally...

561
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:18,855
I've been expecting you.

562
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:24,948
Darla, I'm sorry.

563
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:29,736
Sorry that Danny
was taken away from you.

564
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:32,826
And I'm sorry that I was
responsible for his death.

565
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:35,394
Do you know how many
sons I've buried, Toni?

566
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:39,702
Danny was my last one.

567
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:44,490
- My little boy.
- Darla.

568
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:47,188
We know you summoned La Llorona.

569
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:49,712
Now you need to call her off.

570
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:55,588
You can't call off La Llorona.

571
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:57,851
Once summoned,

572
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:00,636
once a child is promised,

573
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:03,944
there's no stopping her.

574
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,773
At least,

575
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,775
not until Anthony's dead,

576
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,082
in her arms.

577
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:14,215
So that's what you want?

578
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,043
An eye for an eye?

579
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:18,088
My baby's life for your son?

580
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:22,354
- Yes-
- Well, it's not gonna happen,

581
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:25,748
because there's a crew of Serpents
surrounding Baby Anthony, guarding him.

582
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,620
Toni...

583
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,886
you're a mother.

584
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:36,716
Even if there were 50 men standing
between you and your baby,

585
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,675
would that stop you?

586
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,548
- No.
- Exactly.

587
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:48,945
Now imagine that primal
maternal force times a hundred.

588
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:54,081
La Llorona is a storm
unlike any you've ever seen.

589
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:02,655
Oh, my God.

590
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:03,698
Fangs?

591
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:06,093
Anthony?

592
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,183
Fangs!

593
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,227
Hey!

594
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:12,664
Where's Anthony?

595
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:15,145
Where's our son?

596
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:17,147
She...

597
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:18,453
She took him.

598
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:20,281
Where? Where did she take him?

599
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:21,325
Sweetwater.

600
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,504
- Go!
- We need to beat them to the river.

601
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:36,819
Hey, you're kind of quiet.

602
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:39,691
Understandably.

603
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:43,478
I guess I'm just... wondering.

604
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,220
What?

605
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,223
Our fighting, was that...

606
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,966
the ghosts... or... us?

607
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:56,709
I don't know. Maybe both.

608
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,235
Look, that was
our first real fight.

609
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:04,804
We survived.

610
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:06,762
We lived to tell the tale.

611
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:08,416
I mean, barely.

612
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,245
What's our next test gonna be?

613
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,117
Maybe love is just
a series of tests,

614
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:16,250
test the strength
of our relationship.

615
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:20,298
I know that's
kind of bleak, but...

616
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:21,951
- it's also kind of...
- Kind of sweet.

617
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:05,647
Stop!

618
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:07,736
You're not taking my baby.

619
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,434
He's innocent.

620
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:11,740
No one is innocent.

621
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:15,265
You were, your children were.

622
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:21,271
I'm sorry for everything
you went through,

623
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:25,058
but you could show us mercy.

624
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:26,494
You could spare my son.

625
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:28,453
I was called forth.

626
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:31,064
I can't return without the babe.

627
00:39:31,107 --> 00:39:33,371
Well, what if I could
take away the suffering?

628
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:35,068
For good.

629
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:37,375
You could give it to me.

630
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:41,030
And that way, you'd be free.

631
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:42,292
Why would you offer that?

632
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,384
Because I would give up
anything for my son,

633
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:49,952
my life.

634
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:52,825
But also because I killed
another woman's child,

635
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,524
and I should be
punished for that.

636
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:58,700
And it should be me.

637
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:01,921
Not Baby Anthony.

638
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:04,140
You've suffered enough, Martha.

639
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,665
Let me take your place.

640
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,295
Promise me you'll
take care of him, Betty.

641
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,456
Protect him, Betty.

642
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,677
And please let him know
his mother loved him.

643
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:29,964
Hmm.

644
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:33,273
Let me ask you
something, friends.

645
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:36,842
Is there a better word for
motherhood than "sacrifice"?

646
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:39,366
The next time a weeping woman
rises from Sweetwater River

647
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:41,803
or, if you prefer,
the river Styx,

648
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:44,371
a different soul
will take her path,

649
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:48,636
a path that both begins
and ends in Rivervale.
