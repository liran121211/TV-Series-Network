1
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,216
Oh. Hello there.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,801
And welcome to Thornhill,

3
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,887
the Blossom family's
ancestral home.

4
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,807
A house
of secrets and mysteries,

5
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,060
and the most haunted place
in Rivervale.

6
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,896
Is it haunted by ghosts
or memories?

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,191
Or something else? A curse?

8
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,776
Perhaps all three.

9
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,989
Well, would you
look at the time?

10
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,241
It's 7:00 am.

11
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,535
And the women of Thornhill,
past and present,

12
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,830
are waking up
across the decades.

13
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,456
In the here and now,

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,375
Cheryl Blossom wakes up
from a dreamless sleep.

15
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,672
As 65 years ago,

16
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,425
Poppy Blossom stirs awake
in the same room,

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,260
in the same bed.

18
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,845
And while further back still,

19
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,473
Abigail Blossom opens her eyes
to meet the day.

20
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,606
Three blossom women,

21
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,859
one story
echoing across time,

22
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,903
burning as bright and eternal

23
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,114
as a comet's tail
in the night sky.

25
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,206
Today, we will
be discussing comets,

26
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,333
in particular, periodic comets.

27
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,294
Bailey's comet passes through

28
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,920
the inner workings
of our solar system

29
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,173
once every 65 years.

30
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,344
Tonight's a momentous night.

31
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,472
You lucky girls will be able
to marvel

32
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,266
at the comet's beauty
on the North hill

33
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,642
as it streaks through
the night sky

34
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,602
and over Rivervale.

35
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,604
- Mm-hmm?
- Mistress Cheryl,

36
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,189
will Nana Blossom be able

37
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,858
to join us
for the viewing tonight?

38
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,736
She's feeling quite weak today,
so I'm afraid not.

39
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,946
And I will not be with you
at the North hill either.

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,740
I will be by my Nana's bedside,

41
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,075
conducting certain rituals

42
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,286
to help her transition
into the afterlife.

43
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,122
- I have some good news, Nana.
- Oh.

44
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,498
Tonight's the night
we've been planning

45
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,417
for all these years.

46
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,294
Bailey's comet returns
to our skies.

47
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:35,757
Oh. You bring me such relief,
dear child.

48
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,091
Now I must ask you again

49
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,302
while you are
in your right mind.

50
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,970
Roseanne Blossom,
are you certain

51
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,472
you wish to continue
down this road?

52
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,892
Once done, it cannot be undone,

53
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,270
and there is risk.

54
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,440
There's always a risk
when spellcasting.

55
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:57,362
I have never been more certain.

56
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,907
Very well then.
Let's begin with the ritual.

57
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,243
To walk in their shoes,

58
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,704
you must first
know their stories,

59
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,873
their histories.

60
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,084
Who do you wish to begin with?

61
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,212
Both. For their stories,

62
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,632
as you know, are intertwined.

63
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,968
All right. Let's see.

64
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,762
Ah. Yes.

65
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,099
Poppy had just hosted
one of her delightful salons.

66
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,892
Thanks for letting me
stick around

67
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,270
- and bend your ear alone, Poppy.
- Of course, Tamtam.

68
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,772
And you did seem quiet

69
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,399
during our discussion
of Lady Chatterley's Lover.

70
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,442
Oh, it's so silly, Poppy.

71
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,569
I want to start working
at the diner,

72
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,822
but my husband is
dead set against it.

73
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,074
Home is where I belong,
he says.

74
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,617
But I know I would do

75
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,620
a better job of managing Pop's
than he does.

76
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,038
Hmm.

77
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,586
What's this?

78
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,213
Some herbs from my garden.

79
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,798
Sprinkle them in your hubby's
eggs Benedict

80
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,051
and he will come down
with a nasty stomach bug.

81
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,386
And then you can be the heroine

82
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,971
and step up and run Pop's
for the day.

83
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,766
Oh, Poppy,

84
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,269
I don't know
what we'd do without you.

85
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,980
I see here from your resume
that you have

86
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,607
five years teaching experience.

87
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,401
- Is that right?
- Yes.

88
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,236
When I came across
your hiring announcement

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,030
in the paper,
I was moved to apply.

90
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,366
My old school was
shut down, you see,

91
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,910
and turned into a hospital
after the war began.

92
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,329
A wretched affair, isn't it?

93
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,081
My own dear brother James

94
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,500
is fighting
on the western front.

95
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,920
Tell me, the pox is rampant
throughout our land,

96
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,005
have you been afflicted by it?

97
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,382
Yes, when I was but a babe.

98
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,969
I too survived
that hellish plague.

99
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,638
Are you married?

100
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,313
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

101
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,816
I have no need
for women with husbands.

102
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,822
You're hired.

103
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,116
Is it Thomasina or Miss Topaz?
Which do you prefer?

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,159
Thomasina.

105
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,952
Very good.

106
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,914
- Where did you say you were from again?
- Nearby.

107
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:13,998
Greendale.

108
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:38,203
Today, ladies,

109
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:40,816
we shall be discussing
proper table etiquette,

110
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,319
especially in regards
to shared plates

111
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,695
and clear soups.

112
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,447
Actually, Ms. Blossom,

113
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,283
I had a notion
about today's lesson.

114
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,370
Bailey's comet is set
to pass over Rivervale

115
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,163
in a few days' time,

116
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,540
and it offers an excellent

117
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,500
scientific opportunity
for the girls.

118
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,127
Firstly, Thomasina,
it is quite unladylike

119
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,931
to be traipsing
around the woods after dark.

120
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,674
But, more importantly,

121
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,218
the Thornhill Academy for Girls
is a finishing school.

122
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,513
But a comet,
like any celestial body,

123
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,099
is fundamental to the
understanding of our lives.

124
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,519
It's much like a poem, you see.

125
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,481
Everything, the stars, time,
and even you and I,

126
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,817
we're all part of
an intertwining cosmic fabric.

127
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,279
I see.

128
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,323
And I suppose next you'll be
wanting to teach my girls other similarly

129
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,200
impolite topics
from the world of men.

130
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,577
Indeed, I will.

131
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,454
Because men have all the power,

132
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,081
and the world
need not be that way.

133
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,208
That's quite enough
of that talk, Thomasina.

134
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,852
So long as you teach at my
school, you will follow my curriculum.

135
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,506
Class dismissed.

136
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,593
All right, ladies, if you could
please take your seats.

137
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,972
So, for this week's salon,
I was thinking

138
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,849
maybe we discuss
Bailey's Comet,

139
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,892
which I just read
will be passing over

140
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,894
our little town
later this year.

141
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,771
What do we think?

142
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,316
We should have a viewing party,
set up on the roof of Pop's.

143
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,943
That's a swell idea, Tammy.

144
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,695
Though I can't imagine
Jack would be

145
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,739
very interested in a comet.

146
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,449
Oh, by the way, Poppy,

147
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,285
guess who's working the diner's
register these days.

148
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,162
Curious timing, this comet.

149
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,874
Didn't the Soviets
just launch Sputnik?

150
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,709
Wait, is that the missile
I keep hearing about?

151
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,295
It's the Russian
space satellite, Velma,

152
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,547
for spying on us Americans.

153
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,632
You're absolutely right, Bitsy.

154
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,091
Can they really do that?

155
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,509
Oh, by the way, did you hear?

156
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,262
Wendy Weatherbee
was just arrested

157
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,430
for conspiracy.

158
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,182
- No.
- Yes.

159
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,434
Wendy is as red-blooded
American as the rest of us.

160
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,728
Well, apparently now
she's just red.

161
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,021
My question is,

162
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,106
are our children safe
at school?

163
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,735
Ladies, ladies,
no need to fret.

164
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,155
My opinion is,
if people discuss their

165
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,991
different ideas in the privacy
of their own homes,

166
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,451
well, what's the harm?

167
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,120
Poppy Seed Blossom,
do you really mean that?

168
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,472
I truly do.

169
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,168
I suppose I'm just not a fan
of witch hunts.

170
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,252
Of any kind.

171
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,633
Thank you for letting me
stay behind, Poppy.

172
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,968
I promise I won't take up
too much of your time.

173
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,929
Oh pooh, Bitsy,

174
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,138
time spent with you

175
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,932
is always
the highlight of my week.

176
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,394
But what's going on?

177
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,732
The truth is, I'm not happy
in my marriage, Poppy.

178
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,192
I've wondered.

179
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,779
Jack thinks the answer
is to have another child.

180
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,325
Even though my first pregnancy
was...

181
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,828
Well, you remember
how hard that was on me.

182
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,539
Have you considered divorce?

183
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,583
Divorce? Jack?

184
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,628
No, I couldn't, Poppy.
Jack's Catholic.

185
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,132
Well, maybe it's just about
not getting pregnant right now.

186
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,468
Have you ever
looked into birth control?

187
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,345
Oh, I couldn't
possibly ask Dr. Curdle

188
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,724
- for something like that.
- Not to worry.

189
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,893
I have just the thing.

190
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,773
Take this special ginger root
from my garden.

191
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,734
A few flakes
every day in the morning

192
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,318
will make sure you don't start

193
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,071
baking a bun in the oven.

194
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,657
Poppy...

195
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,410
I'm so grateful to you
for listening

196
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,746
and understanding.
What would I do without you?

197
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,737
Oh, my.
What the devil am I doing?

198
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,781
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Poppy.

199
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,616
Oh, Bitsy, Bitsy,
everything's fine.

200
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,742
Nothing bad happened.

201
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,203
Everything will work out.

202
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,955
You'll see. Okay?

203
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,291
Okay. Okay.

204
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,800
Thomasina.

205
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,761
Yes.

206
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,138
I...

207
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,602
I wanted to apologize
for my outburst earlier.

208
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,688
I'm afraid I should be
the one to apologize.

209
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,108
After all, it is
your curriculum, not mine.

210
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,319
True. But...

211
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,947
after some quiet reflection,

212
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,699
I've realized you're right.

213
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,744
From now on, we're going
to teach these young women

214
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,246
hard truths,

215
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,997
tough knowledge.

216
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,917
Prepare them for a world
that might not exist yet,

217
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,712
- but someday will.
- Yes, Abigail.

218
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,131
What can I do to help?

219
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,009
Earth to Poppy.

220
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:26,462
Velma, I am so sorry.

221
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,438
You were telling me
about your husband.

222
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:31,776
Yes. It's just that...

223
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,003
lately, things have
been a bit...

224
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,382
- vanilla in the bedroom.
- Hmm.

225
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,386
And I want to spice things up
a bit with the mister.

226
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,516
But I don't know
how to, exactly.

227
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,310
Hmm. Well,

228
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:53,231
I have got some spice for you.

229
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,318
The Kama-sutra.

230
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,028
Oh, it's the bee's knees.

231
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,321
Oh, also.

232
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,449
What's this?

233
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,243
My own special aphrodisiac mix.

234
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,747
Sprinkle that
into his roast beef and...

235
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,708
he'll never want
to leave your bed.

236
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,129
Abigail,

237
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,381
why didn't you wake me?

238
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,260
Because you are so beautiful
when you sleep.

239
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,763
Thomasina,

240
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,389
how I wish we can live in this

241
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,684
little perfect world
of ours forever.

242
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,648
Who could that be?

243
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,734
Only trouble comes knocking
at this hour.

244
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,570
Abigail Blossom, open up.

245
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,947
I'm here on official business.

246
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,952
Constable Keller,
state your business, sir.

247
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,286
I'm looking
for a murderess.

248
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,247
The harlot's name
is Thomasina Topaz.

249
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,215
There's no one here
by that name. Now, please go.

250
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,342
For your own good.

251
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,302
We have a confirmed case
of the pox here.

252
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,971
There's a plague
upon this house.

253
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,269
Thomasina Topaz,

254
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,772
I would have the truth
from you.

255
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,494
Don't say a word.

256
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,539
I know what you did
with my wife.

257
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,873
I beg your pardon.

258
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,277
Don't you play coy
with me, Poppy.

259
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,878
Well, go on, tell her.

260
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,425
I might have given you
the wrong idea about us, Poppy.

261
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,845
I've never been happier
in my marriage.

262
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,138
And I would be very lucky

263
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,462
to have another child
with Jack.

264
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,601
So just butt out, okay?

265
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,270
You hear that?

266
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,360
Keep out of my marriage, woman.

267
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,320
And so help me,

268
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,948
if you get anywhere
near Bitsy again,

269
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,158
I will kill you.

270
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,969
Why did Constable Keller
call you a murderess?

271
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,514
When I came seeking employment,

272
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,350
you asked if I had a husband.

273
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,353
I said I did not,
which is true.

274
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:41,941
But once I did.

275
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,528
It was an arranged marriage.

276
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,076
He was a cruel man.

277
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,333
He didn't like my ideas
of educating womenkind.

278
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,376
He didn't like my rituals.

279
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,129
He just sought to control me

280
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,300
with the back of his hand
and his belt.

281
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,594
Men are such monsters.

282
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,678
One night...

283
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,849
I saw a look in his eyes...

284
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,644
and I knew it was
either his life or mine.

285
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,900
So I choose mine.

286
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,944
I chose to live.

287
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,034
Stay here.

288
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,456
Stay with me forever.

289
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,462
Mistress Cheryl,
may I come in?

290
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,131
Britannia?

291
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,174
What are you doing here?
And where are the other girls?

292
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,301
They left.

293
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,761
To see the comet
from the North hill.

294
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,180
And why, pray tell,
aren't you with him?

295
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,725
Please, Mistress Cheryl.

296
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,476
I notice things.

297
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,894
I know you and Nana Rose

298
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,481
have been planning something
in secret.

299
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,026
I just don't know what it is.

300
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,070
But I'd like to be here for it.

301
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,405
Oh.

302
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,283
Let the child stay.

303
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,076
Oh. Very well then,
you can stay.

304
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,290
But not a word out of you.
Pull up a chair.

305
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,834
I was just about to tell Nana
what happened to poor Poppy.

306
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,518
Well, hello, boys.

307
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,814
Excuse me. This is my home!

308
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,317
Who the hell
do you think you are,

309
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,527
telling our wives
we can't satisfy them?

310
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,237
I see.

311
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,073
So that's why none
of your wives came today.

312
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,784
You bullied them
into submission.

313
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,245
Pathetic, if you ask me.

314
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,705
Well, we're not asking you.

315
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,626
In fact, we want you
to leave Rivervale ASAP.

316
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,087
The Blossoms have
outstayed their welcome here.

317
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,549
And if I don't leave?

318
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,677
Don't push us on this, Poppy.

319
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,221
You know what I do
for a living.

320
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,390
Kirk Keller,
Thornhill is my home.

321
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,308
I'll never leave it.

322
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,852
Okay, suit yourself.

323
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,216
But don't say
we didn't warn you.

324
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,457
Who is it? Who's there?

325
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,501
My name's Fen Fogarty, ma'am.

326
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,546
I'm a friend of your brother's.
I come with news of him.

327
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,341
Mr. Fogarty,

328
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,635
come in and warm yourself
by the fire.

329
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:02,892
- Welcome.
- Yeah.

330
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,151
Miss Blossom,

331
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,570
it is my sad duty to inform you
that your dear brother James

332
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,448
was killed
during our last battle.

333
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,577
He gave me this letter
to give to you,

334
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,913
right before he passed.

335
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,295
"In the midst
of this brutal war,

336
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,300
it is my dying wish

337
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,262
that you,
my beloved sister, Abigail,

338
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:44,308
would take the hand
of my dearest friend,

339
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,726
Fen Fogarty...

340
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,187
in marriage."

341
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,773
"Dearest friend."

342
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,733
How intimately

343
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,401
did you and James
know one another?

344
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,738
War makes all men bedfellows.

345
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,661
Abigail, you cannot marry
this man, this stranger.

346
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,955
Thomasina,
you don't understand.

347
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,667
My brother was my twin,
my soul mate.

348
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,212
If this was his dying wish,
I must honor it.

349
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,256
There is a darkness in Fen.

350
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,008
I do not know what,
but I have a sixth sense

351
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,634
about these things.

352
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,012
And my intuition tells me
he means you harm.

353
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,472
Nonsense.

354
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,848
He was my brother's confidant.

355
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,517
Letters can be forged.

356
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,520
Tomorrow, when he goes hunting,
we will search his room

357
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,357
for proof
of his true intentions.

358
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,651
I'm certain that man
is not who he says he is.

359
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,654
I will not let

360
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,032
any harm come to you.
I swear it.

361
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,627
Hello, Tammy.

362
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,670
It's nice
to see you working here.

363
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,672
I'll have my usual, please.

364
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,425
A patty melt with a side of
coleslaw and a glass of buttermilk.

365
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:04,221
Do you maybe want that
to go, Poppy?

366
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,689
No. I'd like to eat it here.

367
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,773
Thank you very much.

368
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,775
Fine.

369
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,447
What's the meaning of this?

370
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,739
What are you doing here, Kirk?

371
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,741
We've received an anonymous tip

372
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,077
that you, Miss Blossom,
are a subversive.

373
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,246
A suspected
communist sympathizer.

374
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,373
That's an outrageous lie,
and you know it.

375
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,833
Is it?

376
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,169
What about
the closed-door meetings

377
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,753
you've been coercing

378
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,637
the unsuspecting wives
of Rivervale to attend?

379
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,509
What are you doing? Those are
my precious heirlooms.

380
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,052
You've left us no choice.

381
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,429
I'm sorry, Poppy.

382
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,913
We're taking you in
for questioning.

383
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,059
What, pray tell,
are we looking for?

384
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,812
Evidence of his malfeasance.

385
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,196
This isn't
my brother's hand.

386
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,574
This is someone practicing
my brother's hand.

387
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,871
My family seal.

388
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,040
This is the official
Blossom crest.

389
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,793
Thomasina, I think
you were right.

390
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,462
The betrothal letter
was forged.

391
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,798
Which means you don't have
to marry that imposter.

392
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,055
Objects of the occult.

393
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:15,977
I knew he was
trafficking in the dark arts.

394
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,356
Abigail, I'm afraid
it's worse than I feared.

395
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,400
Fen Fogarty
is not just a scoundrel,

396
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,401
he's a warlock.

397
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,904
What?

398
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,240
But how could you know that?

399
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,950
I have knowledge
about these things.

400
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,587
Heaven protect us.

401
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,802
These are
death portraits, Thomasina.

402
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:50,971
I think he's a murderer.

403
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,271
My lord.

404
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,024
I think he murdered
my brother James.

405
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,902
Women, I'm back with supper.

406
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,007
What the devil
are you two doing in here?

407
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,633
Be gone from my house
this instant.

408
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,886
You do not
give me orders, woman.

409
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,638
Once we are married,
I will become

410
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,973
the Lord of this manor.

411
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,225
- Will you now?
- Abigail, get back!

412
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,602
Stop!

413
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,812
Do it, you devil!

414
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,065
Obey me or I slit her throat
where she stands.

415
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,026
Fen, please.

416
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,946
I'll marry you, Fen.
I'll marry you.

417
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,073
Good.

418
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:52,991
Yes.

419
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,786
We'll do it tonight. Legally.

420
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,205
Properly.

421
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,540
We'll need a vicar then,

422
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,459
to perform the ceremony
and bear witness.

423
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,461
You'll have to fetch one
in town.

424
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,714
Oh, no, you'll go fetch him.

425
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,424
If I leave,
you two will collude

426
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,759
to kill me
and run off together.

427
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,428
I'll lock

428
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,264
this saucy sapphic wench
in the chapel

429
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,809
if you're not back
within an hour with the vicar!

430
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,812
I'll kill her.

431
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,983
All right.

432
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,401
All you have to do
is cooperate.

433
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,986
We know you're a communist.

434
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,696
Just admit it so I can
let you out of here.

435
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,698
I won't admit to a lie.

436
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,949
I haven't done anything wrong.

437
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,785
Is it true
you once visited Russia?

438
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,161
Yes.

439
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,288
To participate
in a chess tournament.

440
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,458
Are you loyal to this country?

441
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,418
This government? The flag?

442
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,922
Yes, yes and yes.

443
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,548
Are you against God, religion?

444
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,593
I'm against witch hunts
and group think.

445
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:57,222
And yet,
you organize gatherings,

446
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,099
unsegregated I might add,

447
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,684
where you read banned books.

448
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,769
Is it true
you use contraceptives?

449
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,213
What is it you really want
from me?

450
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,153
Admit you're a commie,
sign the confession,

451
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,615
or I will put you in jail
to rot.

452
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,575
Do what you want.

453
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,369
I'm not signing anything.

454
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,917
I'm surprised they let you in
to see the red devil.

455
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,586
You're not the devil, Poppy.

456
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,298
But you do need
to sign their confession.

457
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,926
It's just your name.

458
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,303
But what else do I have
other than my name?

459
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,764
My principles.

460
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,559
All the things those men
are terrified of.

461
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,394
If you want
to stay in here

462
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:47,230
and suffer for your principles,

463
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,232
then go ahead.

464
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,777
But I thought you
cared a little bit more...

465
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,529
about...

466
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,075
you know, about us.

467
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,536
But, Bitsy, don't you see?

468
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,414
I am doing this for us.

469
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,040
For you.

470
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,710
For womankind.

471
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,378
For all the free-thinking,

472
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,006
independent daughters
who will come after us.

473
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,226
Bitsy...

474
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,480
don't tell me you're pregnant.

475
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,068
We'll get through this somehow.

476
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,667
No. This baby is exactly
what Jack and I need.

477
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,088
I can't believe
I let you fill my head

478
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,384
with your silly, stupid ideas.

479
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,430
Jack was right about you.

480
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,851
You're just a sad, jealous,

481
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,147
sexually repressed spinster.

482
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,609
I know you don't mean that.

483
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,615
Well, you don't know
anything about me.

484
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,376
After Bitsy visited Poppy
in jail,

485
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,795
they didn't see each other
for the next nine months.

486
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,213
Why so long?

487
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,424
And what brought them
together again?

488
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,968
Poppy, I need your help.

489
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,053
It's about Bitsy.

490
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,142
Did something happen to her?

491
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,395
She's gone into labor.
She's convinced herself

492
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,240
that something is wrong and says
you're the only person that can help.

493
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,068
If you do this, you will not
return to this cell.

494
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,152
I swear it.

495
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,030
Okay, yeah.

496
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,657
Interestingly,

497
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,743
in a confluence
that can only be called cosmic,

498
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,037
the night Bitsy's baby
was to be born

499
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,624
and the night Abigail Blossom
was to be married,

500
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,959
were both nights

501
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,683
when Bailey's comet
passed over Rivervale.

502
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,713
Same as tonight.

503
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,969
So Abigail did marry Fen?

504
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,555
She didn't have
much of a choice, did she?

505
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,682
But fret not, dear Britta,

506
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,185
for Abigail's story
is far from over.

507
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,271
An idea for how to catch Fen
at his most vulnerable

508
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,774
was already taking shape
in her mind.

509
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,922
Say hello to your
beautiful baby girl, Bitsy.

510
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,300
She's perfect.

511
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,304
I just wish I were bringing her
into a better world.

512
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,056
Actually,

513
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,392
this little one was born
under Bailey's comet,

514
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,477
Bitsy.

515
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,230
It's a sign
of great things to come.

516
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,483
Nothing will hold her back.

517
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,072
Before I forget.

518
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,372
It was in my pocket book.

519
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,626
Something for when the time
is right.

520
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,629
You'll know when to use it.

521
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,223
Come now, dear one, join me.

522
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,516
Hurry.

523
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,435
It's time to fulfill
your wifely duties.

524
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,353
Did you ever hear, Fen,

525
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:23,274
of that terrible case
in Fall River, Massachusetts,

526
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,276
about the young woman,
Lizzie Borden,

527
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,153
and what she did
to her tormentors?

528
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,989
Ugh. What's this now?

529
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,409
She killed them with an axe.

530
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,844
Thomasina, my love.

531
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,353
Thomasina.

532
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,105
Thomasina, please help.

533
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,108
Oh, no, no, no, no.

534
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:07,068
Wake up. Please wake up.

535
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,574
She was the perfect

536
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,077
addition to my collection.

537
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,664
You monster.

538
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,500
You're going to burn in hell
for what you've done.

539
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,004
How right you are, Abigail.

540
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,635
The comet.

541
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,555
What perfect timing.

542
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,310
Calling upon my dark knowledge,

543
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,937
fueled by the midnight light,

544
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,357
I curse you, Abigail Blossom.

545
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,235
May your life be as everlasting

546
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:52,072
and solitary as the comet's.

547
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:54,782
May...

548
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,994
you remain unloved

549
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,745
and alone

550
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,831
for all your miserable days.

551
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,130
Thomasina...

552
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,298
Oh.

553
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,224
Well?

554
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,437
Both mother and daughter
are fine.

555
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,314
Okay, let's get you
out of here.

556
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,316
What are those for?

557
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,984
You told me if I helped,
I'd be free.

558
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,652
No. We said you wouldn't have
to go back to your cell,

559
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,571
and you don't. You are
however under house arrest.

560
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,780
- What?
- At Thornhill.

561
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,199
- For how long?
- Indefinitely.

562
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,159
Now come on, Poppy,
don't make a fuss.

563
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,329
And so,
Poppy was shut away.

564
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,290
Doomed to spend
the rest of her days

565
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:45,917
haunting the halls
of Thornhill.

566
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,086
Okay,
so Poppy was arrested,

567
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,172
but what happened to Abigail?

568
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,591
She too lived out her days
in this house,

569
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,468
forever alone.

570
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,056
I'm afraid to ask
what happened to Bitsy.

571
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,475
Funnily enough,

572
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,352
her husband died
under mysterious circumstances

573
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:08,272
about a year after
their second child was born.

574
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,441
Some say he was poisoned,
though the coroner

575
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,777
didn't find any poison
during his autopsy.

576
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,823
Then again,
some plant-based toxins

577
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,326
don't leave a trace.

578
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:31,045
Oh. Is that her?

579
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,007
Is she finally here?

580
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,024
Well, well, well.

581
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,026
Look at what the black cat
dragged in.

582
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,820
If it isn't Sabrina Spellman.

583
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,780
Cheryl Blossom.

584
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,544
Feels like it's been centuries,
doesn't it?

585
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,494
Thank you for coming.

586
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,538
My Nana and I are
forever in your debt.

587
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,123
Oh, don't be ridic.

588
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,417
You know I'd do anything
to help a fellow witch.

589
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,508
Nana, Britta,

590
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,427
there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

591
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,846
Hey, ladies. What's happenin'?

592
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,556
Sabrina is a dear old friend,

593
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,559
and she's come here to help us
with our little ceremony.

594
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,269
How do you know each other?

595
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,564
Oh, we have
a lot of mutual friends,

596
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:34,108
share a lot
of the same interests.

597
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,320
And our covens are
in the same softball league.

598
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,904
Sabrina is
the first person who told me

599
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,197
about performing
a transference.

600
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,699
Yes, indeed.

601
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:44,577
My cousin Ambrose
taught me how to do it.

602
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,955
Essentially, a transference
is a very tricky spell

603
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,415
that can only be performed

604
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,001
on a night of great
cosmic significance,

605
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,712
like tonight, with
Bailey's Comet approaching.

606
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:58,132
Speaking of, it's nearly time.

607
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,928
Britannia, we witches must
spell cast alone. Do you mind?

608
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,556
Yeah.

609
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,563
Are you ready?

610
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,524
Yeah.

611
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,027
Okay. Let's begin.

612
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,370
Our flesh and blood
are but a cage

613
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,497
that withers
as we wear our age.

614
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,082
But there is a way to switch

615
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:34,335
to willing souls
with one we wished.

616
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,587
Let asunder body and soul,

617
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,465
to exchange to spirits,
new and old.

618
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,384
Our flesh and blood
are but a cage

619
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,219
that withers
as we wear our age.

620
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,097
But there is a way to switch

621
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,057
to them souls
with one we wished.

622
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,142
Let asunder body and soul,

623
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,521
to exchange to spirits,
new and old.

624
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,201
It... it worked,

625
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,245
the transference.

626
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,955
How do you feel, Abigail?

627
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,958
Free.

628
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,836
At long last.

629
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,547
Fen's curse

630
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,925
is broken.

631
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,095
Let it go, Abigail.

632
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,517
Let it go,
and finally be at peace.

633
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:34,311
Reunite with
your dearest, Thomasina.

634
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,662
Happy-sad endings
are the best.

635
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,667
Did Nana Rose pass,
Mistress Cheryl?

636
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,419
- Um...
- I'll take this one.

637
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:02,590
Nana Rose's body did die,

638
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,885
but not before we transferred
her soul into...

639
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,678
Mistress Blossom's body?

640
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,014
Yes. And vice versa.

641
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,766
It was a classic body swap,

642
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,060
Freaky Friday style.
But you should know this,

643
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,230
there was no Cheryl.
Not really.

644
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,358
Or there was,
but she was also Poppy.

645
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,820
And before that,
she was Abigail Blossom.

646
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,448
I don't understand.

647
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,742
When the warlock,
Fen Fogarty, died,

648
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,494
he cursed Abigail
with immortality.

649
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,037
To hide that fact,

650
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:36,290
she created the persona
of Poppy Blossom,

651
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,708
then Cheryl Blossom,

652
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,044
so that no one would
suspect the truth.

653
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,795
But Abigail was

654
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,049
forever haunted by the loss
of her first true love,

655
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,217
Thomasina.

656
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,469
She wanted more than anything

657
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,555
to be reunited with her.

658
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,140
The only way
to do that

659
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,683
was to move her soul
into a body

660
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,936
no longer meant to be
in this world.

661
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,482
And tonight,
that's what we did.

662
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,652
The soul that once inhabited
this body,

663
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,445
Abigail's soul,

664
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:12,326
has moved on
to a peaceful eternity

665
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,870
in the sweet hereafter.

666
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,498
And now, I, Roseanne Blossom,

667
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:21,460
can once again
enjoy my precious youth.

668
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:26,549
And Cheryl, Poppy, Abigail...

669
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,468
- she's really dead?
- No.

670
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:30,886
No.

671
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,848
There is no death for witches.

672
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,351
Only transformation.

673
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,979
I mean, I died and came back.

674
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,065
Abigail was a witch?

675
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,024
She was.

676
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,026
As was Thomasina.

677
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,154
Which we can
definitely talk you through.

678
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,532
But how about we do it over
a milk shake at Pop's?

679
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,913
I feel like the twenty-something
witch, Sabrina Spellman,

680
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,333
visiting Rivervale from the
neighboring township of Greendale,

681
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,501
summed it up perfectly.

682
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,170
Happy-sad endings
are the best.

683
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:47,963
Enough said?
