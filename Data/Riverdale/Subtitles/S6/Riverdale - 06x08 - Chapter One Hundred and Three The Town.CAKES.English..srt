1
00:00:01,325 --> 00:00:05,683
Wait. So someone just
submitted this to you?

2
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:07,646
Yeah, to my Riverdale Choice email.

3
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:12,677
In case you're wondering if
I can suddenly hear again,

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,637
I can't. What I can do

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,068
post-explosion is read minds.

6
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:18,640
I can hear the words forming in a

7
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,886
person's brain just
before they speak them.

8
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:23,980
It's, uh, slightly disorienting.

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,058
Ugh.

10
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:27,026
I mean, everyone is entitled...

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,483
I mean, everyone is entitled
to their own opinion, but yikes.

12
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:33,030
I know.

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,661
That's why I published it
anonymously, to protect our identity,

14
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:37,957
which they asked me to.

15
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:43,165
Tabitha and my friends
think my hearing's returned.

16
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,960
It's not impossible to believe,
the doctor said it might.

17
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,921
Am I a bad person for
lying to her, to everyone?

18
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,506
I don't know, Jughead.

19
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,276
What will the town think?

20
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:54,552
What will they do?

21
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,473
That is a great question.

22
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,500
Already I could feel
shock waves rippling across the town.

23
00:01:02,503 --> 00:01:05,229
The article was a blistering
critique of Riverdale.

24
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,858
What the town presented as
versus what it truly was.

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,569
It excoriated Veronica
and Reggie's Casino,

26
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,026
calling it illegal,

27
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:17,236
claiming it would be a gateway
to crime, drug use and violence.

28
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:20,702
It condemned Riverdale's
culture of street gangs.

29
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:25,124
The Serpents and Ghoulies forever
teetering on the brink of war.

30
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:28,211
It called out the town's long
history of intolerance, ignorance,

31
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,463
persecution and backwards thinking.

32
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:34,133
It highlighted our overtaxed,
ineffectual law enforcement,

33
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,011
our utter lack of culture
and the performing arts.

34
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,691
But its most scathing critique took

35
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:40,889
aim at Riverdale's struggling economy,

36
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,941
soaring unemployment and quote,

37
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:45,520
"Homeless encampments on every corner."

38
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,449
Still happy you moved here, stranger?

39
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:50,276
Oh, yes.

40
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,072
Happy as a clam.

41
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:54,821
Every word was a razor blade

42
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,782
that cut to the very
heart of Riverdale itself.

43
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,784
With no author named,

44
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,286
who would take the
brunt of blowback? But...

45
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,038
I can't believe
Jug would do this.

46
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,224
Here we go.

47
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:07,312
- Backstabber.
- Dude, what is this?

48
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,109
"Worst town in America."

49
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:12,427
Seriously?

50
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,507
After we busted our asses
saving Riverdale from Hiram,

51
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,385
why would you publish
something like this?

52
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,847
The Riverdale Choice is
a free press that believes

53
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,181
in critical points of view.

54
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,432
Who?

55
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,433
Who wrote this?

56
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,768
Why would I tell you that?

57
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,107
So you can beat them up?

58
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,396
Yeah, you're freaking right.

59
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,550
Of course not.

60
00:02:30,872 --> 00:02:32,859
Okay, Look, you have a
different point of view.

61
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,032
That's great.

62
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:35,986
Let me interview you.
I'll publish it next week.

63
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,940
No, screw that.

64
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:38,922
I've already talked to Alice and Frank.

65
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,910
They're calling a town hall
meeting so everyone

66
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,273
can respond to this garbage in person.

67
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,229
And you better be there covering it.

68
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,878
Grand Mistress Rose.

69
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,418
I shouldn't be here,

70
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:57,258
but Mistress Abigail is
getting ready to go out and

71
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,094
we have to figure out a way
to get Mistress Cheryl back.

72
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,638
Cheryl is gone.

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,515
Vanished into the void.

74
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,757
No,

75
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,351
I saw her in a mirror that
Abigail was looking into.

76
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,717
I think she's still in her body,

77
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,024
somewhere.

78
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,902
Well, if that were
the case, it would mean

79
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,373
Abigail's keeping her locked away,

80
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:22,790
imprisoned in a kind of

81
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:24,242
mental jail.

82
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,870
Oh, my God.

83
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,540
Is there some way that
we can reach Cheryl?

84
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,074
Make contact with her.

85
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,937
Well, the only way to do that would be

86
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,887
when Abigail

87
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,516
is in a deep sleep,

88
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,647
and you would need to be in
a deep slumber near to her.

89
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,360
I mean, Abigail once
inhabited your body.

90
00:03:47,363 --> 00:03:49,684
You could use that tether

91
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:53,397
to enter and walk her dreamscape.

92
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,149
And perhaps

93
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,026
find Cheryl.

94
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,070
If she exists.

95
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,655
I could drug her tea.

96
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,458
Be warned.

97
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:05,086
If you try this,

98
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:10,163
you must awaken before Abigail does.

99
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:14,003
Or risk her wrath.

100
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:19,162
Jason.

101
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:21,123
Cheryl.

102
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:23,168
My little darlings.

103
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:27,175
I have decided to throw
you a birthday party.

104
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:28,891
Isn't that grand?

105
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,310
I've even invited all
your little friends

106
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,729
from school and church
and the community.

107
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,814
Including Heather?

108
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,155
No, not that two-bit trollop.

109
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:39,944
But everybody else.

110
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,404
Now,

111
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,239
what do you say?

112
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,949
Thank you, dearest Mumsy.

113
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,698
You're very, very welcome,
my precious little angels.

114
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:04,685
Who wrote the
article? Probably Alice.

115
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:06,445
This town is going
to hell in a handbasket.

116
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:08,057
- Maybe, I should move.
- All right.

117
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:10,566
All right, I'm sure everyone has read

118
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:13,685
the article written by our
mysterious author.

119
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,980
And, yes, there is a lot to dispute.

120
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,692
But not the fact that we
do have an illegal casino

121
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,029
operating covertly and
corruptly within our town limits.

122
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,864
If I may.

123
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,909
Babylonium's employees are
all citizens of Riverdale

124
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,704
who are paid a generous living wage.

125
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,708
Also, we have the potential
to bring in out-of-towners.

126
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,793
Guests who would spend

127
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,055
fresh cash across all of our businesses.

128
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:44,424
Nice try, Veronica, but we all know
who truly profits from a casino.

129
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,926
It's its owners.

130
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,636
And I mean, when is
the last time a Lodge

131
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,176
has done anything good for this town?

132
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:51,766
What the hell does that mean?

133
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,973
I think you know
exactly what that means.

134
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,994
Can we cut to the damn chase here?

135
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,109
Who wrote that article?

136
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,273
Oh, come on.

137
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,614
Whoever it is, if you're
going to attack our town,

138
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,115
at least have the guts to own it.

139
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,408
It was me.

140
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,952
I wrote it. I wrote the article.

141
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,081
I... I know I should have had
the courage to put my name on it.

142
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,190
I guess I was just concerned that if you

143
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:20,002
saw the name Pickens
on the byline, then,

144
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,046
you'd dismiss my words out of hand

145
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,507
because of what my
great-great grandfather did.

146
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,176
You mean a genocide
against my ancestors?

147
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,047
Yeah, that's a strike against you.

148
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,500
I'm sorry, you've been
living here, what, four days?

149
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:34,101
And we're supposed to
care what you think?

150
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,852
Well, sometimes it
takes a recent arrival

151
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,687
to see what's really
wrong with the town.

152
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,222
Yeah, well, all I see,

153
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:43,067
is a Johnny-come-lately
talking trash about our town

154
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,811
without offering any real solutions.

155
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:46,739
But I do have solutions.

156
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:48,165
If you're open to hearing them.

157
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:49,740
Buddy, I'm open

158
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,992
to resolving this outside,
You and me, right now.

159
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,037
Okay, Archie.

160
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,996
We do need to let Mr. Pickens speak.

161
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,166
Oh, with a town that's

162
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,071
in such dire straits as
Riverdale, where do you even begin?

163
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:03,444
I know.

164
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:06,296
The homeless encampment
you call "Sketch Alley."

165
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:08,993
Poverty

166
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,845
begets more poverty,
begets drugs, begets crime,

167
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,682
begets more crime until no one is safe.

168
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:15,224
Yeah.

169
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,268
I'm sorry, but the homeless
have got to be bussed out

170
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,409
as quickly and humanely as possible.

171
00:07:20,412 --> 00:07:22,148
- He's right.
- I agree.

172
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,649
The homeless are a problem.

173
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,984
About time someone said it.

174
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,778
We can't just bus them out of town.

175
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,323
And I'm sorry, but that's... not
who we are, and it's not what we do.

176
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,325
Riverdale takes care of their own.

177
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,494
And the people that
live in Sketch Alley,

178
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:39,874
are citizens of this town
just as much as all of us.

179
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,459
We need to show them that we care.

180
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,714
In that case, you've
heard my recommendation.

181
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,665
But we're all ears, Mr. Andrews.

182
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,129
What's yours?

183
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:57,600
And thus began the
battle for Riverdale's soul.

184
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,665
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

185
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,488
Mistress Abigail, you're home.

186
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,199
- How was the town hall?
- Delightsome.

187
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,079
Also, a bit of gossip.

188
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:16,895
T'was Percival Pickens, who wrote that

189
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,018
screed against the town of Riverdale.

190
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:21,271
He may prove an ally to me.

191
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:23,512
But first, me thinks I must acquaint

192
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:25,752
myself with the history of Riverdale

193
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,673
and the role the Pickens
family played in its shaping.

194
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,696
I think I saw a book in
the Thornhill library.

195
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:34,050
I'll fetch it for you, Mistress Abigail.

196
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:36,034
I've just brewed you some tea.

197
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:38,926
Why don't you retire to your room
and I'll bring both up to you?

198
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,611
Don't punch me.

199
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,735
I should, you know.

200
00:08:51,738 --> 00:08:55,532
Look, Archie, I'm a journalist. I'm
supposed to remain impartial. But,

201
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,872
I heard what you said at the town hall.

202
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,768
And for what it's
worth, I agree with you.

203
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:03,048
I think bussing the unhoused out
of Riverdale is not a solution.

204
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:04,377
I know those people.

205
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,712
At times I was one of them

206
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,411
and they've always helped
me when I was in trouble.

207
00:09:11,414 --> 00:09:13,414
They're good people.
They need our resources.

208
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:14,808
Could've said that at the meeting.

209
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:17,889
I will, at the next one, once
you present your big idea.

210
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,058
Well...

211
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,226
I...

212
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,579
I don't have one yet.

213
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:24,714
That's okay.

214
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:26,867
I did some research of my
own after the last meeting.

215
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,357
A lot of cities, they're...
they're building these micro homes.

216
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,318
They're basically cabins, right?

217
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,906
They have a shower
and a toilet and a bed.

218
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,406
Imagine if we did that.

219
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,157
We build one of these homes
for every unhoused person

220
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,911
living in a cardboard box
or a tent on the alley.

221
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,192
We?

222
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:45,067
You're the only person I know
that has a construction business.

223
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:48,876
All right.

224
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,880
Let's do this.

225
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,011
Let's try.

226
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,608
Oh, perfect.

227
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,193
Sweet dreams, Abigail.

228
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,364
And hopefully for me, too.

229
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,610
How are you liking that cake?

230
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,282
Vanilla, your favorite.
Just as requested.

231
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,535
Excuse me.

232
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,636
I'm looking for Cheryl Blossom.

233
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,212
Who the hell are you?

234
00:11:08,215 --> 00:11:09,251
I'm...

235
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,919
a friend of hers.

236
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,629
Is Cheryl not here?

237
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,122
Well, she's right over there.

238
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,827
Facing the wall as punishment for being

239
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,218
such a selfish, ungrateful brat.

240
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,437
But...

241
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,106
it's her birthday, too, isn't it?

242
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,421
Not this year.

243
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,612
Not the way she's been behaving.

244
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,322
Will she get her presents, at least?

245
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,786
Absolutely not.

246
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,093
Now, who did you say you were?

247
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:21,260
Reggie.

248
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:23,531
We haven't talked about it too much but,

249
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,535
I've always assumed we'd be sort of

250
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,872
gaming the system with the casino.

251
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,641
You know, doing our usual
side hustles and scams.

252
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:36,253
I made the same assumptions.

253
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,381
What if we didn't?

254
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,300
Does that mean no scams?

255
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,968
No scams,

256
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,217
no side deals, no loopholes,

257
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,306
no tax evasion.

258
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,985
What if we proved Alice

259
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:54,992
and the haters wrong and
operated completely above board?

260
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:59,623
I just buried my father, Reggie.
Let's start a new chapter and

261
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:02,627
rehabilitate the Lodge name.

262
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,479
Instead of the council fighting us

263
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:06,640
at every turn, we lock arms with them,

264
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:09,853
help fix the town my dad broke.

265
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,982
I like it in theory, Ronnie.

266
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:14,693
But the first thing is

267
00:13:14,696 --> 00:13:17,364
we'd have to get our
licenses and permits in order.

268
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:20,216
Okay.

269
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,509
Is that a problem?

270
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,845
No, it's just very expensive.

271
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,534
Let's pull the trigger, Reggie.

272
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,812
And let's hang my father's
portrait right up here.

273
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,695
As a constant reminder of who
we're not going to be like.

274
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:46,906
I don't disagree with what
you're saying, Mr. Pickens.

275
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,618
Oh, please, call me Percival.

276
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,624
Percival,

277
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:54,289
I just don't want to come down
on either side of the issue

278
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,905
until Archie has had a chance
to present his solutions.

279
00:13:57,908 --> 00:14:00,379
Of course, not. Alice...

280
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,381
Sorry, may I call you Alice?

281
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,590
Yes.

282
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,643
Thank you.

283
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,470
It's just I

284
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,390
assumed that you would have

285
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,436
a personal stake in
making Riverdale safer

286
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,714
given what happened to your daughter.

287
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:19,817
Polly.

288
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,574
All right, people, let's
call this meeting to order.

289
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,160
Our proposal for the
town's future is simple.

290
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,197
Reginald?

291
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,583
Riverdale, the new Atlantic city.

292
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,961
Instead of the town and the casino
being at odds with each other,

293
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,046
why not work together

294
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:48,137
and rebrand as a family-friendly,
destination hotspot?

295
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,514
Let Babylonium

296
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:52,101
be the solution to lifting Riverdale up.

297
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:53,266
So, what,

298
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:55,308
children can gamble now, is that it?

299
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,270
We would open an
arcade, provide daycare.

300
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,188
Here's my problem with the casino.

301
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,232
Riverdale has a lot of broken people.

302
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,735
Including veterans
like myself and Archie.

303
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,976
And a casino just isn't a healthy
environment for people like that.

304
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:11,565
You raise a valid point,
Frank. Let's have that dialogue.

305
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:12,775
But not today.

306
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,361
We have your proposal, Veronica.

307
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:16,161
We will look it over
and get back to you.

308
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:18,706
In the meantime, if we catch one whiff

309
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,001
of any trouble coming from your casino,

310
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,838
then any partnership would
be immediately untenable.

311
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,006
Great.

312
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,052
Thank you, Team Babylonium.

313
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,388
So, the spaces are eight feet wide.

314
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,975
They house one to two people,
and they can be locked which

315
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,853
helps give the occupants a
sense of ownership and security.

316
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,999
And not to mention,

317
00:15:41,002 --> 00:15:42,683
all of the labor, will be provided

318
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:44,732
free of charge by Andrews Construction.

319
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,235
This is a strong, simple
and smart idea, Archie.

320
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,217
Yeah, they have these mini-houses in

321
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:51,198
Chicago, and they are game changing.

322
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,034
- Awesome.
- Yeah. So to start, I was thinking around 30.

323
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,865
Thirty houses?

324
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:58,035
Uh, how much do these things cost?

325
00:15:58,038 --> 00:16:01,916
Well, like I said, Alice, the labor
will be free, but with materials,

326
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,835
I'm thinking around 20, 25.

327
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,797
Thousand for each house?

328
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,158
Oh, no. Uh, Riverdale can't afford
this. We'd have to raise taxes.

329
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,859
More taxes? No way.

330
00:16:12,862 --> 00:16:14,084
We can barely pay our mortgage.

331
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:15,586
Just make the problem go away.

332
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:17,797
I agree with that British dude.

333
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,726
Well, I feel it's my civic duty at
this point to point out that, uh,

334
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,134
my straightforward proposal would cost

335
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:23,938
the people of Riverdale
virtually nothing,

336
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,483
and could be carried out immediately.

337
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,614
We like the vision, Archie.
At least, most of us do.

338
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:34,160
We just need to figure
out a way to fund it.

339
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:38,369
And if you could show us proof of
concept, that would be super helpful.

340
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,122
Yeah, for sure. I'll
figure something out.

341
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,419
I appreciate your time.

342
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,168
Thanks for staying behind to chat.

343
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,284
Not at all.

344
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:49,005
I welcome any opportunity to
get to know my neighbors better.

345
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,252
Yeah, me, too.

346
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,844
- So, you're English?
- Indeed.

347
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,847
Some of the Pickens family came to
the States to settle in the colonies,

348
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,850
others stayed behind in the old country.

349
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,227
Is that where you were
before you came to Riverdale?

350
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,336
Oh, no.

351
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,524
I was traveling here and there.

352
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,401
Nowhere with the potential
of this place, though.

353
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,047
Do you know I think with a spot of

354
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,266
investment and a
little bit of hard work,

355
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:16,426
this place could be the
next Marsha's Vineyard.

356
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,535
Look, maybe we got
off on the wrong foot.

357
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,373
We both want the same thing.

358
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,067
A better, safer Riverdale.

359
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,361
And can't we

360
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:29,295
align on this idea about the houses?

361
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,461
Don't see that happening, Mr. Andrews.

362
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:33,227
Because, if you don't mind my saying,

363
00:17:33,229 --> 00:17:35,135
you're thinking is fundamentally flawed.

364
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,383
And I'll tell you why.

365
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,847
One.

366
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,621
People of Sketch Alley
don't want your help.

367
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:43,225
All they want are handouts.

368
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,770
And if you try and lift
them up, all they'll do is

369
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,567
bring you and your property values down.

370
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:53,591
And number two, at the risk
of disillusioning you further,

371
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,450
your neighbors don't want them here.

372
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,620
Oh, they'll say they're
good, liberal people but,

373
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,645
in their heart of hearts,

374
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:05,000
what they really want

375
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,252
is for the poor, the destitute,

376
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,713
and the smelly to go away

377
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,424
without compromising their own comfort.

378
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,677
You're wrong.

379
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:22,893
And so is your warped,
cynical idea of who we are.

380
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,811
I'll prove it to you.

381
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,440
Well, I don't think so but...

382
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:30,526
let's see.

383
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:38,476
You called this meeting.

384
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:40,118
What can we do for you, Archie?

385
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:41,451
You're both on the council.

386
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,043
But I'm here appealing to you

387
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:46,530
as two of the most prominent
business owners in Riverdale.

388
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:47,999
I need your personal help.

389
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,876
Okay.

390
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,351
We're listening.

391
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:54,945
Would you each be willing to
underwrite one of the houses?

392
00:18:54,948 --> 00:18:58,385
I was thinking after I finished
building them, we could paint them.

393
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,930
One like Pop's and one
like the Whyte Wyrm.

394
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,205
In a way, they'd be like billboards.

395
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,623
And you're sure you don't mind that

396
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,432
I'm a quote unquote, gang member?

397
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:09,771
Oh, come on. No. Not at all.

398
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,690
Where would you set
them up and build them?

399
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,068
I was hoping we could set
them up in the parking lot.

400
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,153
That way, the folks living
in them could feel more

401
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,865
a part of the town's daily life.

402
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,607
Yeah, of course, Archie, we're in.

403
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,695
Great.

404
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:23,982
And as for where we build them,

405
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:26,294
I was thinking we could
do that in Sketch Alley.

406
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,708
Doc.

407
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,587
- Hey!
- How have you been?

408
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,910
Ah, I'm surviving.

409
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:38,258
Well, you look a lot better
than the last time I saw you.

410
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,427
And that's thanks to you.

411
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,429
That's the reason we're here too.

412
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,722
Wanted to repay the favor.

413
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,019
I mean, if you're cool with it.

414
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:46,554
This is my pal Archie.

415
00:19:46,557 --> 00:19:49,406
And the rest of us were hoping
to build some houses for you guys.

416
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:51,284
One for each of you.

417
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:55,111
- Houses?
- They're small, but they're swanky.

418
00:19:55,114 --> 00:19:57,068
If you guys want to
help out, that's great.

419
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,528
If not, we just wanted to let
you know what we are up to.

420
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,864
All good either way.

421
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,453
When do we start?

422
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:04,218
- How about right now?
- All right.

423
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:13,568
We've got a problem.

424
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:14,796
I've been crunching numbers,

425
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,172
and given all of our start
up costs, our expenses,

426
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,632
not to mention permit costs...

427
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,841
Cut to the chase, Reggie.

428
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,984
We're overleveraged, Ronnie.

429
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,342
Majorly.

430
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:24,931
If we're strictly legit,

431
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,361
it's going to be impossible
for us to turn a profit.

432
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:28,602
Maybe ever.

433
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,240
Unless.

434
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:34,557
Don't say it.

435
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,316
We start running scams,
which we could do.

436
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,453
Uh, Miss Lodge, Mr. Mantle.

437
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:45,448
I apologize, but you've got to come
to the private gambling room now.

438
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:47,743
What is it? Something bad?

439
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,007
Yeah.

440
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:56,713
Oh, my God.

441
00:20:58,552 --> 00:20:59,884
What should we do?

442
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:01,470
Cut him down? Call the ambulance?

443
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:04,462
That's what a legit place
would do, right? Right?

444
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:07,717
Yes, yes. But we don't
have that luxury, Reggie.

445
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,391
This would be a horrible
news story if it broke.

446
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:14,271
It would confirm Alice and the
council's worst fear about this place

447
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,566
and Babylonium would be
over before it even began.

448
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,361
Wait.

449
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,822
I know who could help.

450
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:24,418
Abuelita's iceman.

451
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,529
Mistress Cheryl, it's me.

452
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:45,637
Britta.

453
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,765
You have to wake up.

454
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,013
Please.

455
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,603
What is it, Brittania?

456
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,979
Wake up.
Time to rise and shine.

457
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:59,566
Time to get out of bed, you lazy bones.

458
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,901
It's dearest Mumsy. You have to hide.

459
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,737
If she finds you, I
don't know what she'll do.

460
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,946
Now!

461
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,617
Wake up, devil children!

462
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,037
Mumsy? What's going on?
It's the middle of the night.

463
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,582
Doesn't matter. This place,
this whole house is a sty.

464
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,918
Now, you grab that bucket and a
brush and you get to work, piggies.

465
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Yes, dearest Mumsy.

466
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:25,592
Get on your hand and knees and you
scrub that floor till it's clean!

467
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,178
I want to be able to eat off of it.

468
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,391
What are you doing?
Why aren't you working?

469
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,107
You get back to work.

470
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,605
Or I will get the hanger to
you. Don't make me hurt you!

471
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,806
Hey, it's Doc, right?

472
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:16,084
Do you need something?

473
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:28,599
And what did our young Kevin Keller get

474
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:30,906
in exchange for wanting
to provide shelter

475
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,575
to the people of Sketch Alley?

476
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:37,288
A hammer to the skull is what he got.

477
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,458
This vicious attack
is a clear indication

478
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,627
that these people don't want our help.

479
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:46,548
You offer them a helping hand
and they respond with violence.

480
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,343
Well, this journalist
and town council member

481
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,512
says, no more...

482
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,976
How is Kevin doing?

483
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,644
I just came from the hospital.

484
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,895
He's gonna be okay.

485
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,647
This is a mess, Archie.

486
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,398
Believe me, I know, Toni.

487
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,984
These houses are going to be
painted with our businesses on them.

488
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,362
If they're associated
with violence and crime...

489
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,762
I know.

490
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:13,740
And I know that article didn't
exactly do the Serpents any favors.

491
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:14,766
It did not.

492
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,869
But you still have
our financial support.

493
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,955
So, maybe just hold off a beat

494
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,666
before you paint it to
match the Whyte Wyrm.

495
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,959
Yeah, that makes sense.

496
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,544
Thanks for the support, Toni.

497
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,004
Yeah, no problem.

498
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,303
I'll send you my payment
on Chime right now.

499
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:29,632
Cool.

500
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,177
How about you, Tabitha?

501
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,553
I am...

502
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,848
still in, Archie.

503
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,893
Paint job and all. So...

504
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,020
When do you want to
set up the first house?

505
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,150
Well, I'll bring it by
in my truck later today.

506
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:46,935
Thank you, guys.

507
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:48,438
Talk to me, Reggie.

508
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:50,086
So I figured, that
dead guy must have been

509
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,070
on a major losing streak,
and that's why he...

510
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,114
Killed himself.

511
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,365
Sadly, that makes sense.

512
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,577
But, no. He was winning big-time.

513
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,999
So, I called the blackjack dealer
and pulled the security footage.

514
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,045
He was on top of the
world, up almost 20 grand.

515
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,716
Why would a guy who's winning
every hand suddenly just...

516
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,133
off himself?

517
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,304
Wait, wait, wait. Stop the tape.

518
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,306
Look.

519
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,350
Who the hell is that?

520
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,310
That's the British creep from Town Hall,

521
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,398
Percival Pickens. What
the hell is he saying?

522
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,443
Miss Lodge, I'm here.

523
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,991
Heraldo, thank you so much
for coming so speedily.

524
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,034
Where's the body?

525
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,703
Jeez. Cut to the chase much?

526
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,582
Downstairs. I'll take you.

527
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:46,465
Grand Mistress Rose,
it's gotten so much worse.

528
00:25:46,468 --> 00:25:50,796
Mistress Cheryl's mother is
torturing her in every way imaginable.

529
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,175
Penelope has always
been Cheryl's tormentor.

530
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,844
So, of course, Abigail
would have conjured her

531
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:00,133
as my granddaughter's
adversary in the dreamscape.

532
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:01,760
She's terrifying.

533
00:26:01,763 --> 00:26:06,895
You must tell Cheryl that
Penelope is but a fiction.

534
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,983
A bogeyman pulled from
her own subconscious.

535
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,652
That perhaps will shake
her free of her stupor

536
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,155
and spur her into action.

537
00:26:15,197 --> 00:26:17,114
Else, Abigail may take

538
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,951
permanent possession of
my granddaughter's body.

539
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:24,038
But I never even get the chance to
talk to her before the nightmare...

540
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,968
Penelope descends on us.

541
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:29,269
Then perhaps, child, you must divine

542
00:26:29,272 --> 00:26:31,857
a better way to communicate with her.

543
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,429
Gentlemen, I am so sorry to intrude.

544
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,841
May I come in?

545
00:26:40,844 --> 00:26:42,100
Yeah.

546
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,569
I heard all about what
happened in Sketch Alley. And...

547
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,125
I wanted to talk to you.

548
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:00,386
In hopes it never happens again.

549
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,165
Well, what do you think, Tabitha?

550
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,209
I think it is beautiful, Archie.

551
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,921
Well, it was a group effort.

552
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:16,089
And bonus, Benjamin Moore donated
the paint for future houses, too.

553
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,594
I think it's a great start, Arch.

554
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,810
You're good.
I can take it from here.

555
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,021
What are you gonna do?

556
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,940
After dark, I'll put
him in his car, drive into Jersey,

557
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,818
hang him up in the bathroom
of a rest stop with no cameras,

558
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,986
call it in.

559
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,697
How are things going otherwise?

560
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,282
How's business?

561
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,771
Slow.

562
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:46,109
We're not quite the sensation
we were hoping we'd be.

563
00:27:46,112 --> 00:27:47,861
You know, if you want,

564
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:50,555
I could put the word out
to some wise guys I know.

565
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,086
They got money,

566
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,507
and they like spending it.

567
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,965
I appreciate the offer, and no
offense to your wise guys, but...

568
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:02,637
we're trying to avoid
that, if at all possible.

569
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,122
No worries, just...

570
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,266
trying to help.

571
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,846
Actually, you know what you could do?

572
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,230
Could you look into someone for me?

573
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,857
His name's Percival
Pickens. He's British.

574
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,776
Just got into town and...

575
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,655
there's something off about him.

576
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,447
And I want to know what.

577
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,716
Yeah, I can do that.

578
00:28:34,264 --> 00:28:36,183
Hey, Tabitha. What's up?

579
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,635
I'm on my way.

580
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:50,677
What the hell!

581
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,874
Oh, Doc.

582
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,791
Why did you do that to Kevin?

583
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,460
I have no idea.

584
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,171
I have absolutely no memory
of attacking your friend.

585
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,245
Well, you did.

586
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:21,506
One minute, I'm hammering and...

587
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,761
and the next minute, I'm just...

588
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,923
standing over your friend.

589
00:29:26,926 --> 00:29:29,042
Getting ready to take
another swipe at him.

590
00:29:30,998 --> 00:29:33,086
You gotta believe me, Jughead.

591
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:34,630
It was...

592
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:37,352
like someone put the idea in my head.

593
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:39,652
Who?

594
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,571
Who could have done that?

595
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,053
He, uh...

596
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:46,430
had an accent.

597
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:48,151
He might have had a British accent.

598
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:53,164
Thank you again,
for agreeing to meet with me.

599
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,958
Like I mentioned, I would
love to do a follow up article

600
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,293
to the one that you wrote.

601
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,087
Something like a rebuttal.

602
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,924
Well, to each his own.

603
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,718
I've been thinking about
this quote that I read.

604
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,283
"The true measure of any society

605
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:10,430
can be found in how it treats
its most vulnerable members."

606
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:13,267
Well, whoever said that obviously
didn't grow up in Riverdale.

607
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,658
It's Gandhi.

608
00:30:14,661 --> 00:30:16,943
So tell me, Percival,

609
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:20,482
do you really think that bussing
the unhoused out of Riverdale

610
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,027
is the best that we
can muster as a society?

611
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,862
Well, as I mentioned before,

612
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,657
I am coming at this from
a place of compassion.

613
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,741
My main concern is for the

614
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,100
the law-abiding citizens
of Riverdale, those who pay

615
00:30:32,102 --> 00:30:35,440
their taxes and contribute to
the betterment of our society.

616
00:30:35,443 --> 00:30:38,875
Now, I've been to
several Sketch Alleys in my time.

617
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,713
The truth is, charity is
doing them a disservice.

618
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:46,130
As is giving them a handout when
what they really should be doing

619
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:48,427
is fending for themselves.

620
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:52,765
Tell me, are you having fun rooting
around inside my brain, Mr. Jones?

621
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,077
What?

622
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,833
Get out of my
head, you piece of garbage!

623
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,220
Are you all right, Mr. Jones?

624
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:03,935
Did I not answer the
question to your satisfaction?

625
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,054
Mistress Cheryl?

626
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,725
Is that you?

627
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,395
It's me. I'm here.

628
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:45,191
Mistress Cheryl, what happened
to your beautiful hair?

629
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,778
Mumsy, of course.

630
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,779
She cut it off when she
saw me with my friend...

631
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,743
Heather.

632
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,662
Please, Mistress Cheryl,
you have to listen to me.

633
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,956
This isn't happening.
You're in a dreamscape.

634
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,125
Your mother isn't actually here.

635
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,586
What? Of course, she is.

636
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,670
No.

637
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,187
It's hard to explain.

638
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,090
I have written down
everything you need to know.

639
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,593
What is going on here?

640
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,595
Unbelievable.

641
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,889
I catch you with one sapphic slut,

642
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,602
and not an hour later,
you're back with another one.

643
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:21,978
Whomever you are, you should be ashamed.

644
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,481
Screw you.

645
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,524
You're not even real, Mrs. Blossom.

646
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,985
How dare you?

647
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,324
Get out of Thornhill.
You don't belong here.

648
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,164
Please, Mrs. Blossom...

649
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,875
Don't you show your
face in this house again.

650
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,267
Mistress Cheryl, the world you

651
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,507
are currently inhabiting is not reality,

652
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:59,057
but rather a hellish dreamscape
from which we must free you.

653
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,060
Your physical body
is currently possessed

654
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,683
by the spirit of Abigail Blossom.

655
00:33:02,686 --> 00:33:05,273
And she has trapped you in
a prison in your own mind...

656
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,638
with Penelope as your cruel warden.

657
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:10,516
But she is not real, Mistress Cheryl.

658
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,700
And you must not let her dominate you.

659
00:33:12,703 --> 00:33:14,274
Do not let her break your spirit.

660
00:33:14,277 --> 00:33:17,117
For if she does, your soul
may wither and dissipate

661
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,427
within the confines
of your corporeal body.

662
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,831
She is but a ghost.

663
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,208
A creation of the imagination.

664
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,245
You can defeat her.

665
00:33:27,596 --> 00:33:33,427
I am gonna beat you to
within an inch of your life,

666
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:37,305
you deviant, wretched creature!

667
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,767
Why are you looking at me like that,

668
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,186
you shameless, little wretch?

669
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,857
Because I know the truth now, Mumsy.

670
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,108
You're not real.

671
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,360
Is that a fact?

672
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,778
Yes.

673
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,284
You're in my mind, you psychotic bitch.

674
00:33:57,217 --> 00:33:59,406
And you shouldn't be here.

675
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,464
What are you guys doing?

676
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,232
I'm here to break that
house down and haul it away.

677
00:34:14,235 --> 00:34:16,114
No, you're not.

678
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:17,887
Tabitha called us, Archie.

679
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,389
We started a project, and we're
doubling down to finish it.

680
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,309
And a few hours later, someone
will have vandalized them again.

681
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,644
Then, we will repaint them.

682
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,397
And again, and again. As
many times as we have to.

683
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,283
Why don't you grab a brush?

684
00:34:30,286 --> 00:34:31,444
It's cold out.

685
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,991
I do need to talk to you
about something, though.

686
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:38,082
I don't think Doc was the
one that attacked Kevin.

687
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:39,408
Who else would it have been?

688
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,701
Hello, there.

689
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,383
Now what are you folks doing?

690
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,805
My goodness, aren't
those charming houses?

691
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,928
No need for them anymore, though.

692
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,505
Sketch Alley is no longer an issue.

693
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,863
Meaning what?

694
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:56,383
I took it upon myself
to visit Sketch Alley.

695
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:59,303
I spoke to the people
living there, and...

696
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,514
got them to move on.

697
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,017
Leave town, start over somewhere else.

698
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,977
And how did you do that?

699
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,315
Call it the power of persuasion.

700
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,776
I also bought them bus tickets, and...

701
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:17,238
gave them each $100 to
build new lives elsewhere.

702
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,198
I don't believe you.

703
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,742
Well, see for yourselves.

704
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,871
Then afterwards, hopefully,
see you at the town hall.

705
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,541
Keep up the good work.

706
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,936
Mistress Cheryl?

707
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,361
You're alive?

708
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:01,073
I am. And visiting you
in your dreams, Brittania.

709
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,741
You've done well.

710
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:06,954
And proven yourself a
dutiful and loyal factotum.

711
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,168
For that, you will be rewarded.

712
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:11,048
But only after we have driven that

713
00:36:11,051 --> 00:36:13,652
she-demon Abigail
out of my beautiful body.

714
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:15,304
How will we do that?

715
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,025
I haven't the faintest idea.

716
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,473
Please, please, please. Thank you.

717
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,977
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

718
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,396
Uh, the town of Riverdale
can breathe a little easier,

719
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,274
now that the denizens of Sketch Alley

720
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,676
are on their way to a better place.

721
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,324
The idea to pay their location
costs may have been mine,

722
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,952
but I, um, couldn't have
pulled it off without the help

723
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:50,055
of your sheriff, Tom Keller, a man who

724
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:52,091
represents the very best of Riverdale.

725
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,543
Keeping with the good news,

726
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,378
I'm also pleased to announce that

727
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,089
Percival will be joining my department.

728
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,424
And he'll be working as a deputy

729
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,510
along with me and my
son to keep the peace

730
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,130
and fulfill the promise of Riverdale

731
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,385
that has eluded us for so long.

732
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,569
Dude's like a super villain.

733
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,899
That's exactly what he is.

734
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,934
We seriously need to talk tonight. Okay?

735
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,548
Alice.

736
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:37,210
In all the excitement, the
casino didn't even come up.

737
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,788
Yeah, have you looked
over our proposal, or what?

738
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,137
I have.

739
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:46,010
And after careful review and
some solid advice from Percival,

740
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,341
the council believes that there's a lot

741
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:50,975
of risk in partnering with Babylonium.

742
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,727
Which could be mitigated, possibly.

743
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,899
But quite frankly, Veronica,
the biggest liability is you.

744
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,365
Me?

745
00:38:00,368 --> 00:38:02,848
The Lodge name is synonymous with

746
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:05,947
crime and corruption because of Hiram.

747
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:10,202
You're its figurehead, the public face.

748
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:13,706
So, the council feels that we
could really only support the casino

749
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,084
and this idea of it becoming
the new Atlantic City,

750
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,795
is if you take a back
seat. Out of the limelight.

751
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:25,551
Alice, I am not my father.

752
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,136
In fact, I've worked

753
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,513
really, really hard to
not be like my father...

754
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,390
Take offense or not, Veronica,

755
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,952
but I'd like to see you do
this without our support.

756
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,813
The picketing, the bad publicity,

757
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,898
the complaints to the gaming board,

758
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,404
the raids, the sanctions,
we won't lose this fight.

759
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,174
Okay. Time for a new plan.

760
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,119
We already tried taking the high road.

761
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,956
If Riverdale doesn't want to bet on us,

762
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,543
we'll have to lean in to who
we are and what we do best.

763
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,503
As my mother likes to say,

764
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,756
I am my father's daughter.

765
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,717
Does that mean running scams?
Side hustles and loopholes?

766
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,552
All of the above, Reggie.

767
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:12,097
All systems go. And,
Heraldo, that offer you made

768
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,559
about putting out the word
to your wise guys, do it.

769
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:19,146
We need to start making
money. Real money, fast.

770
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,940
No problem.

771
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:23,817
Oh, and by the way, I
looked into that guy for you.

772
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,862
Percival? And, what did you find?

773
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,536
Nothing.

774
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:31,407
There's no paper trail
behind him. The guy's a ghost.

775
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,160
It's like he didn't even exist

776
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,875
before he showed up here in Riverdale.

777
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,719
Archie.

778
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,488
Betty?

779
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:54,328
Can you do me a favor? Can you shut

780
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:57,360
off the TV and the rest of the lights?

781
00:39:57,363 --> 00:39:58,813
Yeah, sure.

782
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,107
Is everything okay?

783
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,402
Oh, my God. What's going
on? Did TBK hurt you?

784
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,407
No. No, I lost him in Maine.

785
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,241
This is something else.

786
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,542
What?

787
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:16,888
You know how I've been getting
those really bad headaches?

788
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:18,557
They've only gotten worse.

789
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,293
And I figured out that
they are triggered by light.

790
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:25,045
So, the brighter the light,
the more excruciating the pain.

791
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,254
Oh, my God.

792
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,465
I think it's a side effect
of being able to see auras.

793
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,760
Which I can still do, by the way.

794
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,638
Hi.

795
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,889
I'm so sorry.

796
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,808
That's okay.

797
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,269
God, it feels good to be home.

798
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,312
It hasn't been the same without you.

799
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,981
Yeah? What did I miss? Anything?

800
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,316
A lot.

801
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,446
It turns out Jug can read minds

802
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,780
since the explosion.

803
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,173
- What?
- Yeah.

804
00:40:53,176 --> 00:40:56,242
And Percival Pickens, that weird
guy who showed up out of nowhere

805
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,327
and tried to buy my house?

806
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,360
Mmm-hmm.

807
00:40:58,363 --> 00:41:00,987
We think he can control people's minds.

808
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,087
Make people do things. Bad things.

809
00:41:06,846 --> 00:41:09,071
We're in trouble,
Betty. The whole town is.
