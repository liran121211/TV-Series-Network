1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,269
Oh. Hello there.

2
00:00:08,312 --> 00:00:09,618
And welcome to Thornhill,

3
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:12,708
the Blossom family's
ancestral home.

4
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,624
A house
of secrets and mysteries,

5
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:18,888
and the most haunted place
in Rivervale.

6
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:21,978
Is it haunted by ghosts
or memories?

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,198
Or something else? A curse?

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,852
Perhaps all three.

9
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:31,031
Well, would you
look at the time?

10
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,120
It's 7:00 am.

11
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:35,339
And the women of Thornhill,
past and present,

12
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:38,908
are waking up
across the decades.

13
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:40,475
<i>In the here and now,</i>

14
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:42,358
<i>Cheryl Blossom wakes up
from a dreamless sleep.</i>

15
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:47,482
<i>As 65 years ago,</i>

16
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:50,224
<i>Poppy Blossom stirs awake
in the same room,</i>

17
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,313
<i>in the same bed.</i>

18
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:53,749
<i>And while further back still,</i>

19
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:56,491
<i>Abigail Blossom opens her eyes
to meet the day.</i>

20
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:04,412
Three blossom women,

21
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:07,676
one story echoing across time,

22
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,721
burning as bright and eternal

23
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:12,115
as a comet's tail
in the night sky.

24
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,252
Today, we will
be discussing comets,

25
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:47,384
in particular, periodic comets.

26
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:49,125
Bailey's comet passes through

27
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,996
the inner workings
of our solar system

28
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,173
once every 65 years.

29
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:57,351
Tonight's a momentous night.

30
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,287
You lucky girls will be able
to marvel

31
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:03,095
at the comet's beauty
on the North hill

32
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,464
as it streaks through
the night sky

33
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,403
and over Rivervale.

34
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:08,405
- Mm-hmm?
- Mistress Cheryl,

35
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,015
will Nana Blossom be able

36
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,669
to join us
for the viewing tonight?

37
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:14,542
She's feeling quite weak today,
so I'm afraid not.

38
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:16,761
And I will not be with you
at the North hill either.

39
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:18,546
I will be by my Nana's bedside,

40
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:20,896
conducting certain rituals

41
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,115
to help her transition
into the afterlife.

42
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,944
- I have some good news, Nana.
Oh.

43
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,313
Tonight's the night
we've been planning

44
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:29,470
for all these years.

45
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:31,123
Bailey's comet returns
to our skies.

46
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:35,563
Oh. You bring me such relief,
dear child.

47
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:36,912
Now I must ask you again

48
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,349
while you are
in your right mind.

49
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:40,785
Roseanne Blossom,
are you certain

50
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,265
you wish to continue
down this road?

51
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:45,964
Once done, it cannot be undone,

52
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:48,271
and there is risk.

53
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:52,493
There's always a risk
when spellcasting.

54
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:57,193
I have never been more certain.

55
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,936
Very well then.
Let's begin with the ritual.

56
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:04,069
To walk in their shoes,

57
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:06,507
you must first
know their stories,

58
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,899
their histories.

59
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,163
Who do you wish to begin with?

60
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:14,297
Both. For their stories,

61
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:17,431
as you know, are intertwined.

62
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:19,998
All right. Let's see.

63
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:22,566
Ah. Yes.

64
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,917
Poppy had just hosted
one of her delightful salons.

65
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:27,702
Thanks for letting me
stick around

66
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:30,270
- and bend your ear alone, Poppy.
- Of course, Tamtam.

67
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:32,663
And you did seem quiet

68
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,467
during our discussion
of <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover.</i>

69
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:36,276
Oh, it's so silly, Poppy.

70
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,365
I want to start working
at the diner,

71
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,628
but my husband is
dead set against it.

72
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:43,152
Home is where I belong, he says.

73
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:44,414
But I know I would do

74
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,634
a better job of managing Pop's
than he does.

75
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:49,244
Hmm.

76
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,382
What's this?

77
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:57,035
Some herbs from my garden.

78
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,622
Sprinkle them in your hubby's
eggs Benedict

79
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:01,866
and he will come down
with a nasty stomach bug.

80
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,215
And then you can be the heroine

81
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:05,043
and step up and run Pop's
for the day.

82
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:08,569
Oh, Poppy,

83
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:11,093
I don't know
what we'd do without you.

84
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:13,791
I see here from your resume
that you have

85
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:16,403
five years teaching experience.

86
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:18,230
- Is that right?
- Yes.

87
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:20,058
When I came across
your hiring announcement

88
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:22,844
in the paper,
I was moved to apply.

89
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:25,194
My old school was
shut down, you see,

90
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,718
and turned into a hospital
after the war began.

91
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,329
A wretched affair, isn't it?

92
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:31,896
My own dear brother James

93
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,334
is fighting
on the western front.

94
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:37,728
Tell me, the pox is rampant
throughout our land,

95
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:38,836
have you been afflicted by it?

96
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,210
Yes, when I was but a babe.

97
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:43,995
I too survived
that hellish plague.

98
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,650
Are you married?

99
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:55,137
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

100
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,835
I have no need
for women with husbands.

101
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:04,625
You're hired.

102
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:07,192
Is it Thomasina or Miss Topaz?
Which do you prefer?

103
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:08,237
Thomasina.

104
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,760
Very good.

105
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:12,981
- Where did you say you were from again?
- Nearby.

106
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:14,024
Greendale.

107
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:38,223
Today, ladies,

108
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,617
we shall be discussing
proper table etiquette,

109
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:43,403
especially in regards
to share plates

110
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:44,491
and clear soups.

111
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,275
Actually, Ms. Blossom,

112
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:48,320
I had a notion
about today's lesson.

113
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:52,455
Bailey's comet is set
to pass over Rivervale

114
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:53,978
in a few days' time,

115
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:55,371
and it offers an excellent

116
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,329
scientific opportunity
for the girls.

117
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:59,941
Firstly, Thomasina,
it is quite unladylike

118
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:01,856
to be traipsing
around the woods after dark.

119
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,467
But, more importantly,

120
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:07,035
the Thornhill Academy for Girls
is a finishing school.

121
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:10,342
But a comet,
like any celestial body,

122
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,910
is fundamental to the
understanding of our lives.

123
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:16,348
It's much like a poem, you see.

124
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:20,309
Everything, the stars, time,
and even you and I,

125
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:22,833
we're all part of
an intertwining cosmic fabric.

126
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,836
I see.

127
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,144
And I suppose next you'll be wanting
to teach my girls other similarly

128
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:31,276
impolite topics
from the world of men.

129
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,626
Indeed, I will.

130
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,280
Because men have all the power,

131
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:36,891
and the world
need not be that way.

132
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,762
That's quite enough
of that talk, Thomasina.

133
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:41,548
So long as you teach at my school,
you will follow my curriculum.

134
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:45,334
Class dismissed.

135
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:48,598
All right, ladies, if you could
please take your seats.

136
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:52,776
So, for this week's salon,
I was thinking

137
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,648
maybe we discuss Bailey's Comet,

138
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,693
which I just read
will be passing over

139
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:58,695
our little town later this year.

140
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,567
What do we think?

141
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,134
We should have a viewing party,
set up on the roof of Pop's.

142
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:05,746
That's a swell idea, Tammy.

143
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,748
Though I can't imagine
Jack would be

144
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,532
very interested in a comet.

145
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,273
Oh, by the way, Poppy,

146
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:14,102
guess who's working the diner's
register these days.

147
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:16,191
Curious timing, this comet.

148
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:19,673
Didn't the Soviets
just launch Sputnik?

149
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,762
Wait, is that the missile
I keep hearing about?

150
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,112
It's the Russian
space satellite, Velma,

151
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:26,593
for spying on us Americans.

152
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:27,700
You're absolutely right, Betsy.

153
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:28,899
Can they really do that?

154
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,553
Oh, by the way, did you hear?

155
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:33,338
Wendy Weatherbee
was just arrested

156
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:34,514
for conspiracy.

157
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:35,993
- No.
- Yes.

158
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:38,256
Wendy is as red-blooded
American as the rest of us.

159
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,781
Well, apparently now
she's just red.

160
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:41,825
My question is,

161
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,914
are our children safe at school?

162
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,788
Ladies, ladies, no need to fret.

163
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:50,965
My opinion is,
if people discuss their

164
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:53,794
different ideas in the privacy
of their own homes,

165
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:55,273
well, what's the harm?

166
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:58,189
Poppy Seed Blossom,
do you really mean that?

167
00:08:58,233 --> 00:08:59,233
I truly do.

168
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:04,239
I suppose I'm just not a fan
of witch hunts.

169
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:05,282
Of any kind.

170
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:10,462
Thank you for letting me
stay behind, Poppy.

171
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,769
I promise I won't take up
too much of your time.

172
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:14,728
Oh. Oh, Betsy,

173
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:15,946
time spent with you

174
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,948
is always
the highlight of my week.

175
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,430
But what's going on?

176
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:25,739
The truth is, I'm not happy
in my marriage, Poppy.

177
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,045
I've wondered.

178
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,787
Jack thinks the answer
is to have another child.

179
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,357
Even though my first pregnancy
was...

180
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,621
Well, you remember
how hard that was on me.

181
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:41,624
Have you considered divorce?

182
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:44,409
Divorce? Jack?

183
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:47,456
No, I couldn't, Poppy.
Jack's Catholic.

184
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:50,938
Well, maybe it's just about
not getting pregnant right now.

185
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:54,289
Have you ever
looked into birth control?

186
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,160
Oh, I couldn't
possibly ask Dr. Curdle

187
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:59,773
- for something like that.
- Not to worry.

188
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:01,905
I have just the thing.

189
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,824
Take this special ginger root
from my garden.

190
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:09,783
A few flakes
every day in the morning

191
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,393
will make sure you don't start

192
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:13,090
baking a bun in the oven.

193
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:16,485
Poppy...

194
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:19,227
I'm so grateful to you
for listening

195
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,751
and understanding.
What would I do without you?

196
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,784
Oh, my.
What the devil am I doing?

197
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,830
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Poppy.

198
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:58,701
Oh, Betsy, Betsy,
everything's fine.

199
00:10:58,745 --> 00:10:59,746
Nothing bad happened.

200
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,226
Everything will work out.

201
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:04,751
You'll see. Okay?

202
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,317
Okay. Okay.

203
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:15,805
Thomasina.

204
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:21,157
I...

205
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:26,424
I wanted to apologize
for my outburst earlier.

206
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:29,514
I'm afraid I should be
the one to apologize.

207
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:32,126
After all, it is
your curriculum, not mine.

208
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,345
True. But...

209
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,740
after some quiet reflection,

210
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:40,525
I've realized you're right.

211
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:43,790
From now on, we're going
to teach these young women

212
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,313
hard truths,

213
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:46,793
tough knowledge.

214
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:49,970
Prepare them for a world
that might not exist yet,

215
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:53,756
- but someday will.
- Yes, Abigail.

216
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,149
What can I do to help?

217
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:02,025
<i>♪ I'm gonna drive you
Through the night ♪</i>

218
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:07,204
<i>♪ Down the hills</i>

219
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:11,687
<i>♪ I'm gonna
Tell you something you ♪</i>

220
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,343
<i>♪ Don't want to hear</i>

221
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:21,175
<i>♪ I'm gonna show you
Where it's dumped... ♪</i>

222
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:22,742
Earth to Poppy.

223
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,615
Velma, I am so sorry.

224
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:28,530
You were telling me
about your husband.

225
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:31,620
Yes. It's just that...

226
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:34,014
lately, things have
been a bit...

227
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,192
- vanilla in the bedroom.
- Hmm.

228
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:42,196
And I want to spice things up
a bit with the mister.

229
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:47,592
But I don't know
how to, exactly.

230
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,116
Hmm. Well,

231
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:53,250
I have got some spice for you.

232
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,124
The Kama-sutra.

233
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,821
Oh, it's the bee's knees.

234
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,344
Oh, also.

235
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:03,347
What's this?

236
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:06,046
My own special aphrodisiac mix.

237
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,571
Sprinkle that
into his roast beef and...

238
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:11,747
<i>he'll never want
to leave your bed.</i>

239
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:16,143
Abigail,

240
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,189
why didn't you wake me?

241
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:22,279
Because you are so beautiful
when you sleep.

242
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:25,848
Thomasina,

243
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,197
how I wish we can live in this

244
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,721
little perfect world
of ours forever.

245
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,466
Who could that be?

246
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,773
Only trouble comes knocking
at this hour.

247
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:41,385
Abigail Blossom, open up.

248
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,952
I'm here on official business.

249
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,001
Constable Keller,
state your business, sir.

250
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,132
I'm looking for a murderess.

251
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,265
The harlot's name
is Thomasina Topaz.

252
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:01,231
There's no one here
by that name. Now, please go.

253
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:03,233
For your own good.

254
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,105
We have a confirmed case
of the pox here.

255
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,020
There's a plague
upon this house.

256
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:14,114
Thomasina Topaz,

257
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:15,811
I would have the truth from you.

258
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,520
Don't say a word.

259
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,611
I know what you did
with my wife.

260
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:34,699
I beg your pardon.

261
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:36,266
Don't you play coy
with me, Poppy.

262
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:38,878
Well, go on, tell her.

263
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:44,448
I might have given you
the wrong idea about us, Poppy.

264
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:47,930
I've never been happier
in my marriage.

265
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:48,931
And I would be very lucky

266
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,280
to have another child with Jack.

267
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,631
So just butt out, okay?

268
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,113
You hear that?

269
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:03,182
Keep out of my marriage, woman.

270
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:05,121
And so help me,

271
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:07,994
if you get anywhere
near Betsy again,

272
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,169
I will kill you.

273
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:26,969
Why did Constable Keller
call you a murderess?

274
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:31,321
When I came seeking employment,

275
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:34,150
you asked if I had a husband.

276
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:36,370
I said I did not, which is true.

277
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:40,940
But once I did.

278
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:44,552
It was an arranged marriage.

279
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:51,080
He was a cruel man.

280
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:58,131
He didn't like my ideas
of educating womenkind.

281
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:00,176
He didn't like my rituals.

282
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,179
He just sought to control me

283
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:06,313
with the back of his hand
and his belt.

284
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,403
Men are such monsters.

285
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:10,534
One night...

286
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,885
I saw a look in his eyes...

287
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:17,672
and I knew it was
either his life or mine.

288
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:22,938
So I choose mine.

289
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:25,985
I chose to live.

290
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,034
Stay here.

291
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:37,474
Stay with me forever.

292
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,264
<i>Mistress Cheryl, may I come in?</i>

293
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:45,961
Britannia?

294
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,224
What are you doing here?
And where are the other girls?

295
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:50,096
They left.

296
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:51,579
To see the comet
from the North hill.

297
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:54,230
And why, pray tell,
aren't you with him?

298
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,754
Please, Mistress Cheryl.

299
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:58,278
I notice things.

300
00:16:58,321 --> 00:16:59,714
I know you and Nana Rose

301
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:02,499
have been planning something
in secret.

302
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:06,025
I just don't know what it is.

303
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,115
But I'd like to be here for it.

304
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:10,203
Oh.

305
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:13,075
Let the child stay.

306
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,903
Oh. Very well then,
you can stay.

307
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:20,082
But not a word out of you.
Pull up a chair.

308
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,867
I was just about to tell Nana
what happened to poor Poppy.

309
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:29,570
<i>♪ Feel guilty
When you kissed me ♪</i>

310
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:34,227
<i>♪ Last night...</i>

311
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:40,407
Well, hello, boys.

312
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:43,845
Excuse me. This is my home!

313
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:47,109
Who the hell
do you think you are,

314
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,590
telling our wives
we can't satisfy them?

315
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,070
I see.

316
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:54,116
So that's why none
of your wives came today.

317
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,813
You bullied them
into submission.

318
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:59,295
Pathetic, if you ask me.

319
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:00,557
Well, we're not asking you.

320
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:04,431
In fact, we want you
to leave Rivervale ASAP.

321
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:07,086
The Blossoms have
outstayed their welcome here.

322
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:10,567
And if I don't leave?

323
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:14,484
Don't push us on this, Poppy.

324
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:16,269
You know what I do for a living.

325
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:19,185
Kirk Keller,
Thornhill is my home.

326
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:20,360
I'll never leave it.

327
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:22,666
Okay, suit yourself.

328
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,990
But don't say
we didn't warn you.

329
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:44,253
Who is it? Who's there?

330
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:46,299
My name's Fen Fogarty, ma'am.

331
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:49,563
I'm a friend of your brother's.
I come with news of him.

332
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:53,393
Mr. Fogarty,

333
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,656
come in and warm yourself
by the fire.

334
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:01,923
- Welcome.
- Yeah.

335
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:10,627
Miss Blossom,

336
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:13,369
it is my sad duty to inform you
that your dear brother James

337
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:15,458
was killed
during our last battle.

338
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,376
He gave me this letter
to give to you,

339
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,943
right before he passed.

340
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:29,298
"In the midst
of this brutal war,"

341
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:34,347
it is my dying wish

342
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,089
that you,
my beloved sister, Abigail,

343
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:42,355
would take the hand
of my dearest friend,

344
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:43,747
Fen Fogarty...

345
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,185
"in marriage."

346
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,796
"Dearest friend."

347
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:50,537
How intimately

348
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,452
did you and James
know one another?

349
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:55,759
War makes all men bedfellows.

350
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:02,462
Abigail, you cannot marry
this man, this stranger.

351
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:04,768
Thomasina, you don't understand.

352
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:08,468
My brother was my twin,
my soul mate.

353
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:12,254
If this was his dying wish,
I must honor it.

354
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,082
There is a darkness in Fen.

355
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,084
I do not know what,
but I have a sixth sense

356
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:17,433
about these things.

357
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:20,088
And my intuition tells me
he means you harm.

358
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:21,263
Nonsense.

359
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:22,656
He was my brother's confidant.

360
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:25,311
Letters can be forged.

361
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:28,314
Tomorrow, when he goes hunting,
we will search his room

362
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:31,186
for proof
of his true intentions.

363
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,667
I'm certain that man
is not who he says he is.

364
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:37,453
I will not let

365
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:40,064
any harm come to you.
I swear it.

366
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:51,424
Hello, Tammy.

367
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:53,469
It's nice
to see you working here.

368
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:55,471
I'll have my usual, please.

369
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:58,474
A patty melt with a side of
coleslaw and a glass of buttermilk.

370
00:20:58,518 --> 00:21:02,261
Do you maybe want that
to go, Poppy?

371
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:12,488
No. I'd like to eat it here.

372
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:13,620
Thank you very much.

373
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:15,795
Fine.

374
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:01,494
What's the meaning of this?

375
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:02,558
What are you doing here, Kirk?

376
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:04,540
We've received an anonymous tip

377
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,890
that you, Miss Blossom,
are a subversive.

378
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:09,066
A suspected
communist sympathizer.

379
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,417
That's an outrageous lie,
and you know it.

380
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,635
Is it?

381
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,246
What about
the closed-door meetings

382
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,552
you've been coercing

383
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,554
the unsuspecting wives
of Rivervale to attend?

384
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:22,558
What are you doing? Those are
my precious heirlooms.

385
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,125
You've left us no choice.

386
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:25,474
I'm sorry, Poppy.

387
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:26,918
We're taking you in
for questioning.

388
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,871
What, pray tell,
are we looking for?

389
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:32,829
Evidence of his malfeasance.

390
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:42,012
This isn't my brother's hand.

391
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:44,580
This is someone practicing
my brother's hand.

392
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:50,673
My family seal.

393
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:53,067
This is the official
Blossom crest.

394
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,592
Thomasina, I think
you were right.

395
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:58,289
The betrothal letter was forged.

396
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,814
Which means you don't have
to marry that imposter.

397
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,082
Objects of the occult.

398
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,783
I knew he was
trafficking in the dark arts.

399
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:17,178
Abigail, I'm afraid
it's worse than I feared.

400
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,398
Fen Fogarty
is not just a scoundrel,

401
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:21,442
he's a warlock.

402
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:23,706
What?

403
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,056
But how could you know that?

404
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,971
I have knowledge
about these things.

405
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,592
Heaven protect us.

406
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:46,816
These are
death portraits, Thomasina.

407
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:48,992
I think he's a murderer.

408
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:57,348
My lord.

409
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:00,830
I think he murdered
my brother James.

410
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,919
Women, I'm back with supper.

411
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,811
What the devil
are you two doing in here?

412
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,682
Be gone from my house
this instant.

413
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:29,685
You do not
give me orders, woman.

414
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:31,687
Once we are married,
I will become

415
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:32,775
the Lord of this manor.

416
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:35,038
- Will you now?
- Abigail, get back!

417
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:36,605
- Stop!

418
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:38,694
Do it, you devil!

419
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:41,088
Obey me or I slit her throat
where she stands.

420
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:44,047
Fen, please.

421
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:48,008
I'll marry you, Fen.
I'll marry you.

422
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,096
Good.

423
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,011
Yes.

424
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:54,580
We'll do it tonight. Legally.

425
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:56,233
Properly.

426
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,366
We'll need a vicar then,

427
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:00,542
to perform the ceremony
and bear witness.

428
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:02,544
You'll have to fetch one
in town.

429
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:05,765
Oh, no, you'll go fetch him.

430
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:07,244
If I leave, you two will collude

431
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:08,768
to kill me and run off together.

432
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,248
I'll lock

433
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:14,077
this saucy sapphic wench
in the chapel

434
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:16,819
if you're not back
within an hour with the vicar!

435
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:19,822
I'll kill her.

436
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:24,958
All right.

437
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:26,481
<i>All you have to do is cooperate.</i>

438
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,787
We know you're a communist.

439
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,745
Just admit it so I can
let you out of here.

440
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:31,747
I won't admit to a lie.

441
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:32,811
I haven't done anything wrong.

442
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:34,576
Is it true
you once visited Russia?

443
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,969
Yes.

444
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:38,101
To participate
in a chess tournament.

445
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:41,540
Are you loyal to this country?

446
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,498
This government? The flag?

447
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,719
Yes, yes and yes.

448
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:48,372
Are you against God, religion?

449
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:50,592
I'm against witch hunts
and group think.

450
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:55,031
And yet,
you organize gatherings,

451
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:56,903
unsegregated I might add,

452
00:25:56,946 --> 00:25:58,731
where you read banned books.

453
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:00,820
Is it true
you use contraceptives?

454
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:02,223
What is it you really want
from me?

455
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:09,959
Admit you're a commie,
sign the confession,

456
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:12,614
or I will put you in jail
to rot.

457
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,573
Do what you want.

458
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:17,401
I'm not signing anything.

459
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:23,712
I'm surprised they let you in
to see the red devil.

460
00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:25,584
You're not the devil, Poppy.

461
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,371
But you do need
to sign their confession.

462
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:32,721
It's just your name.

463
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:35,376
But what else do I have
other than my name?

464
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:37,813
My principles.

465
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:40,381
All the things those men
are terrified of.

466
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:42,209
If you want to stay in here

467
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:45,299
and suffer for your principles,

468
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:47,040
then go ahead.

469
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,782
But I thought you
cared a little bit more...

470
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:52,566
about...

471
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:56,876
you know, about us.

472
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:59,618
But, Betsy, don't you see?

473
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,490
I am doing this for us.

474
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:03,839
For you.

475
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:06,755
For womankind.

476
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,191
For all the free-thinking,

477
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:11,020

don't tell me you're pregnant.

in jail,

493
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:30,839
they didn't see each other
for the next nine months.

494
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:32,014
Why so long?

495
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:35,235

Did something happen to her?

499
00:28:44,984 --> 00:28:46,942
She's gone into labor.
She's convinced herself

that something is wrong and says
you're the only person that can help.

544
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:18,920
Say hello to your
beautiful baby girl, Betsy.

545
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:22,315
She's perfect.

546
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,363
I just wish I were bringing her
into a better world.

547
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:28,887
Actually,

548
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,454
this little one was born
under Bailey's comet,

549
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:33,282
Betsy.

550
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:35,241
It's a sign
of great things to come.

551
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,505
Nothing will hold her back.

552
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:44,076
Before I forget.

553
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:52,388
It was in my pocket book.

554
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:56,653
Something for when the time
is right.

555
00:31:58,003 --> 00:31:59,656
You'll know when to use it.

556
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,232
Come now, dear one, join me.

557
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,321
Hurry.

558
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:14,236
It's time to fulfill
your wifely duties.

559
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,151
Did you ever hear, Fen,

560
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:20,068
of that terrible case
in Fall River, Massachusetts,

561
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:22,070
about the young woman,
Lizzie Borden,

562
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:24,203
and what she did
to her tormentors?

563
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:25,987
Ugh. What's this now?

564
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,425
She killed them with an axe.

565
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:47,878
Thomasina, my love.

566
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:57,149
Thomasina.

567
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:59,107
Thomasina, please help.

568
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:02,154
Oh, no, no, no, no.

569
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:04,069
Wake up. Please wake up.

570
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:10,379
She was the perfect

571
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:13,121
addition to my collection.

572
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:16,472
You monster.

573
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:19,562
You're going to burn in hell
for what you've done.

574
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:23,001
How right you are, Abigail.

575
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,658
The comet.

576
00:33:29,877 --> 00:33:32,575
What perfect timing.

577
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:38,103
Calling upon my dark knowledge,

578
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:40,018
fueled by the midnight light,

579
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:43,151
I curse you, Abigail Blossom.

580
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:46,285
May your life be as everlasting

581
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:49,070
and solitary as the comet's.

582
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:51,811
May...

583
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:55,076
you remain unloved

584
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,556
and alone

585
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,862
for all your miserable days.

586
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:06,174
Thomasina...

587
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:07,306
Oh.

588
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:17,228
Well?

589
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:21,233
Both mother and daughter
are fine.

590
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:23,104
Okay, let's get you out of here.

591
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:25,106
What are those for?

592
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,803
You told me if I helped,
I'd be free.

593
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:28,477
No. We said you wouldn't have
to go back to your cell,

594
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:30,392
and you don't. You are
however under house arrest.

595
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:31,591
- What?
- I told you.

596
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:33,027
- For how long?
- Indefinitely.

597
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,160
Now come on, Poppy,
don't make a fuss.

598
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:38,337
<i>And so, Poppy was shut away.</i>

599
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,122
<i>Doomed to spend
the rest of her days</i>

600
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,950
<i>haunting the halls of Thornhill.</i>

601
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,127
<i>Okay, so Poppy was arrested,</i>

602
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,998
but what happened to Abigail?

603
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:50,610
She too lived out her days
in this house,

604
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:52,481
forever alone.

605
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:57,095
I'm afraid to ask
what happened to Betsy.

606
00:34:58,008 --> 00:34:59,401
Funnily enough,

607
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:01,162
<i>her husband died
under mysterious circumstances</i>

608
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:05,103
<i>about a year after
their second child was born.</i>

609
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,235
<i>Some say he was poisoned,
though the coroner</i>

610
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,803
<i>didn't find any poison
during his autopsy.</i>

611
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:14,634
<i>Then again,
some plant-based toxins</i>

612
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,331
<i>don't leave a trace.</i>

613
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:28,126
Oh. Is that her?

614
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:31,041
Is she finally here?

615
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,406
<i>♪ Must be the season
Of the witch... ♪</i>

616
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:48,842
Well, well, well.

617
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:51,105
Look at what the black cat
dragged in.

618
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,889
If it isn't Sabrina Spellman.

619
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:54,587
Cheryl Blossom.

620
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,415
Feels like it's been centuries,
doesn't it?

621
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:00,288
Thank you for coming.

622
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:02,334
My Nana and I are
forever in your debt.

623
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:03,944
Oh, don't be ridic.

624
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:06,425
You know I'd do anything
to help a fellow witch.

625
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:12,996
Nana, Britta,

626
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,216
there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

627
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,653
Hey, ladies. What's happenin'?

628
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:19,351
Sabrina is a dear old friend,

629
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:22,354
and she's come here to help us
with our little ceremony.

630
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,312
How do you know each other?

631
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:27,359
Oh, we have
a lot of mutual friends,

632
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:29,926
share a lot
of the same interests.

633
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,147
And our covens are
in the same softball league.

634
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,714
Sabrina is
the first person who told me

635
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:36,237
about performing a transference.

636
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:37,499
Yes, indeed.

637
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:40,372
My cousin Ambrose
taught me how to do it.

638
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:43,766
Essentially, a transference
is a very tricky spell

639
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,246
that can only be performed

640
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,814
on a night of great
cosmic significance,

641
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:50,512
like tonight, with
Bailey's Comet approaching.

642
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:53,950
Speaking of, it's nearly time.

643
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:57,954
Britannia, we witches must
spell cast alone. Do you mind?

644
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:00,566
Yeah.

645
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:08,400
Are you ready?

646
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,316
Yeah.

647
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,057
Okay. Let's begin.

648
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:23,415
Our flesh and blood
are but a cage

649
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,286
that withers as we wear our age.

650
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,896
But there is a way to switch

651
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,378
to willing souls
with one we wished.

652
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:32,380
Let asunder body and soul,

653
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:35,514
to exchange to spirits,
new and old.

654
00:37:35,557 --> 00:37:37,429
Our flesh and blood
are but a cage

655
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:39,300
that withers as we wear our age.

656
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:41,911
But there is a way to switch

657
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:44,131
to them souls
with one we wished.

658
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:45,959
Let asunder body and soul,

659
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:49,528
to exchange to spirits,
new and old.

660
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:03,281
It... it worked,

661
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,326
the transference.

662
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,980
How do you feel, Abigail?

663
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:09,983
Free.

664
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:12,855
At long last.

665
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:15,554
Fen's curse

666
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:17,947
is broken.

667
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:22,125
Let it go, Abigail.

668
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:26,521
Let it go,
and finally be at peace.

669
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:30,351
Reunite with
your dearest, Thomasina.

670
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:46,672
Happy-sad endings are the best.

671
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:52,460
Did Nana Rose pass,
Mistress Cheryl?

672
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:54,419
- Um...
- I'll take this one.

673
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,379
Nana Rose's body did die,

674
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:01,687
but not before we transferred
her soul into...

675
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,471
Mistress Blossom's body?

676
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:05,821
Yes. And vice versa.

677
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:08,563
It was a classic body swap,

678
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:10,870
<i>Freaky Friday</i> style.
But you should know this,

679
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:14,047
there was no Cheryl. Not really.

680
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,180
Or there was,
but she was also Poppy.

681
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:19,835
<i>And before that,
she was Abigail Blossom.</i>

682
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:23,491
I don't understand.

683
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:25,537
When the warlock,
Fen Fogarty, died,

684
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,539
he cursed Abigail
with immortality.

685
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:28,844
To hide that fact,

686
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:32,370
she created the persona
of Poppy Blossom,

687
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:33,501
then Cheryl Blossom,

688
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:36,112
so that no one would
suspect the truth.

689
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:37,592
But Abigail was

690
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:41,117
forever haunted by the loss
of her first true love,

691
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:42,162
<i>Thomasina.</i>

692
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:44,512
<i>She wanted more than anything</i>

693
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:46,558
to be reunited with her.

694
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:48,951
The only way to do that

695
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:50,475
was to move her soul into a body

696
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:52,955
no longer meant to be
in this world.

697
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,307
And tonight, that's what we did.

698
00:39:57,351 --> 00:40:00,441
The soul that once inhabited
this body,

699
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,269
Abigail's soul,

700
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:08,406
has moved on
to a peaceful eternity

701
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:10,669
in the sweet hereafter.

702
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:13,323
And now, I, Roseanne Blossom,

703
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:17,502
can once again
enjoy my precious youth.

704
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:22,594
And Cheryl, Poppy, Abigail...

705
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,465
- she's really dead?
- No.

706
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:26,901
No.

707
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:29,862
There is no death for witches.

708
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:32,386
Only transformation.

709
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:35,998
I mean, I died and came back.

710
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:38,087
Abigail was a witch?

711
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,089
She was.

712
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:41,830
As was Thomasina.

713
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:44,964
Which we can
definitely talk you through.

714
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:47,532
But how about we do it over
a milk shake at Pop's?

715
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,711
