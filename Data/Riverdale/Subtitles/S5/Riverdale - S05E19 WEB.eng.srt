1
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,759
It's been almost a year.

2
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:13,096
Like the grown-ups in It,
we returned to our haunted hometown

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:17,142
and confronted the darkest monsters
we'd ever faced, ourselves.

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,684
We'd survived.

5
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:24,983
But surviving isn't the same as thriving,
and none of us, it seemed, were thriving.

6
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,235
So?

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,739
How did it go? Did you pass?

8
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:34,284
I... almost passed.

9
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,287
Oh, Reggie, no, I'm so sorry.

10
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:43,501
But you can take the Series 7 exam again.
You'll be a fully licensed stockbroker.

11
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,588
Yes, or I was thinking...

12
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:51,134
we could open a casino here in town.

13
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,431
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you remember how much fun we had

14
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,683
running games out of La Bonne Nuit?

15
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,312
I hold very fond memories of that time,

16
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:06,316
but I've decided
that after the school year ends,

17
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,485
I'm going back to New York.

18
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,569
Really?

19
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,655
What about Carrot Top?

20
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,705
Archie and I are no more.

21
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,127
He understands my future's in New York.

22
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,013
Glad to see
I'm not the only one day-drinking.

23
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,349
Are you here alone?

24
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,893
You just missed Jackson.
He moved back home.

25
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,896
Oh. Thank you. Eric's such a good guy.

26
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,979
Yeah.

27
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,566
Is that why you look so sad?

28
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,321
No, I'm happy for him.
I'm sure we'll see him again.

29
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,115
I, uh...

30
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,495
I don't know if you heard,
but Veronica and I broke up.

31
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,913
For good this time.

32
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,665
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

33
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,877
- What happened?
- Seven years happened.

34
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,339
- Yeah.
- We became different people.

35
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,386
Ronnie belongs in New York,
and I belong here in Riverdale.

36
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,764
I'm reopening Andrews Construction.

37
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,393
Oh, looks like we're gonna be neighbors
for the foreseeable future.

38
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,187
I just got permission
to reopen the Riverdale FBI office

39
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:30,358
because, by the way, you're now talking
to Special Agent Betty Cooper.

40
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,651
- Officially.
- Wow.

41
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,570
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,988
When's the graduation?

43
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,322
And can we go?

44
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,824
I missed it.

45
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,703
But I got my diploma in the mail.

46
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,328
Well, damn.

47
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,208
- Can I at least pay for the next round?
- Sure.

48
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,255
And here I thought your days
of summoning me were over, Waldo.

49
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,965
The worm turns, Mr. Jones.

50
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,678
Some of the students are interested
in restarting the student newspaper.

51
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,596
The Blue and Gold.

52
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:04,058
Trouble is, none of our current faculty
have the bandwidth to supervise it.

53
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,855
- You want me to?
- Yes.

54
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,942
- What do you say, Mr. Jones?
- I say get me that rewrite.

55
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,528
Cameron, put the word out.

56
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,282
The She-Wolf of Wall Street is coming back
to take a bite out of the Big Apple.

57
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,660
What, right now?
I wouldn't do that, Ronnie.

58
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,955
Why not? You said
I could come back whenever I wanted.

59
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,208
Yeah, that was before
you killed Chad in cold blood.

60
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,793
That was self-defense.

61
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,877
I'm sure.

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,507
But I doubt any firm would be willing
to hire the Black Widow of Wall Street,

63
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,052
which is what everyone's calling you now.

64
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,263
Maybe call me again in six months.

65
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,569
Are you sure you're not scared
to be toiling away down here?

66
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,279
Not at all, Miss Blossom.

67
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,740
Physical labor will keep me
in shape for football.

68
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,823
Glad to hear it.

69
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,452
Palladium is the missing piece
in my ministry.

70
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,703
The fabled fifth element,

71
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,122
the bridge between the physical
and spiritual worlds

72
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,374
that will grant me power.

73
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,334
- That sounds so cool.
- Indeed.

74
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,253
All right, come.

75
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:17,215
It's time to wipe the soot off our faces
before we're late for the big surprise.

76
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,596
Keep them closed. Keep them closed.

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,224
You know I don't like surprises.

78
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,352
Well, that really sucks because...

79
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,561
Surprise!

80
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,939
Oh, my God, you guys.

81
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,609
Here's to Quantico's latest
and greatest field officer,

82
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,028
Agent Betty Cooper.

83
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,364
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

84
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,910
Speech! Speech! Speech!

85
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,706
Oh, wow, okay. I was not expecting this.

86
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,876
But it means more to me
than I could ever express,

87
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,504
so... thank you.

88
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,090
It's been a rough year, but...

89
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,551
I love you all.

90
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,639
You've given us a lifetime of reasons
to be proud of you.

91
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,391
This one takes the cake.

92
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,101
And speaking of cake...

93
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,237
- So, what does this mean?
- I'm staying in Riverdale.

94
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,114
Just like I promised my mom.

95
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:27,577
God knows, there's enough crime here
to last me several lifetimes.

96
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,123
Well, I don't know
if you've heard about me and Archie.

97
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,751
I did, Vee. I'm sorry.

98
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,921
But I'm sure you're excited
to get back to your old life in New York,

99
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,631
even though we'll miss you.

100
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,179
Should we head back to the diner?

101
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,307
I actually asked Delores
to cover the night for us.

102
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,390
Oh, really?

103
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,642
And why is that?

104
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:57,106
Well, I figured that we didn't actually
get to have our date at Cucina Sacasa.

105
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,357
Oh, true.

106
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,527
- I could go for some Italian.
- Right now?

107
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,871
- I'm glad you're doing better, Alice.
- Yeah.

108
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:16,167
It doesn't get any easier,
but every day it hurts a little less.

109
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,630
You, um...
You getting out of the house at all?

110
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,091
I'm trying to.

111
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,219
Do you have something in mind?

112
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,240
I have news.

113
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,701
Weatherbee asked me to come back
and run the school paper.

114
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,663
And as long as I don't mess it up,

115
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,166
he said that I could start possibly
teaching again in the fall.

116
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,459
Wow!

117
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,796
Maybe then you'd be able
to move out of Archie's garage.

118
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,008
Oh, man, I was just starting
to love the smell of mold and turpentine.

119
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:12,640
You know, um, if you're gonna be working
full-time in the fall,

120
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,060
that's when my apartment's lease is up.

121
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,273
You and me? Cohabitating?

122
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,778
- It's Delores.
- Probably the ice machine on the fritz.

123
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,030
Hey, Delores, what's up?

124
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,657
What?

125
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,246
Got any threes?

126
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,831
Go fish, bish.

127
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,254
Holy crap, Pop's is on fire.

128
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,719
- Aw, what the hell?
- They're slashed on this side too.

129
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,305
Guys, get the spares. Fangs, get the jack.

130
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,884
I'm so sorry, Tabitha.

131
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,887
We should've gotten here faster.

132
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,640
Archie, come on,
you did everything you could.

133
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,102
You and your firemen are the only reason
this place is even standing at all.

134
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,231
It's true.
I've never seen tires changed so fast.

135
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,071
How do I call my grandpa in Florida?

136
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,240
What do I tell him?

137
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,825
That our family business went up
in flames?

138
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,663
Delores said it was a Ghoulie
who threw the Molotov cocktail.

139
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:02,416
- A Ghoulie? What's his motive?
- It wasn't his motive.

140
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,295
I can guarantee that Ghoulie was acting
on someone else's behalf.

141
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,464
Give you three guesses who.

142
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:09,965
Your dad.

143
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,262
I can't believe
I worked for that sorry SOB.

144
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,681
If the scumbag
who torched this place is a Ghoulie,

145
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,724
Fangs and I will take care of it.

146
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,143
- We'll get confirmation.
- Do that, Toni.

147
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,647
But I don't need confirmation.
I don't think any of us do.

148
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,276
Who else would set fire to Pop's
and slash our truck's tires?

149
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,579
I don't remember ordering room service.

150
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,876
Hiram Lodge, you are under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

151
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,713
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

152
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,339
You have the right to an attorney.

153
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,259
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

154
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,970
I can afford one,
and he'll have me out before dinner.

155
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,690
Woodward and Bernstein.
Seymour Hersh. Ronan Farrow.

156
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,068
- What do these people have in common?
- All journalists.

157
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,988
Yes, they are journalists.

158
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,701
More specifically, they are journalists
who courageously spoke truth to power.

159
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,371
Freedom of the press. This is one
of the most basic building blocks

160
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,373
in a healthy, functioning society and...

161
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,419
we take it for granted out here,
but there are places around the world

162
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,297
where information is controlled
by dictators.

163
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,800
And the truth is shaped
to serve those who are in power.

164
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,887
Kind of like
what the Lodge Ledger does in Riverdale.

165
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,263
Yes.

166
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,475
Yeah, exactly like that.

167
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,271
Hiram's booked.
He's right, he'll beat the charges.

168
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,107
There's nothing we can do
to link him to the arson.

169
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,317
Not yet.

170
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,653
Toni's gonna find that Ghoulie.
In the meantime...

171
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,029
Let's search his office.

172
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,948
There's gotta be something in there
that ties him to this crime

173
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,576
or literally,
any other crime at this point.

174
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,161
And we'd be looking for...?

175
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,831
Shady contracts,
financials, illicit receipts.

176
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,334
- It's not my bailiwick.
- Me neither.

177
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,046
- We need someone who speaks that language.
- Who also wants to take Hiram down.

178
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,256
- Veronica.
- Veronica.

179
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,646
The sooner you tell us who paid you,
the sooner it'll be done.

180
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,273
Fine.

181
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,529
- Fangs, turn up the radio again.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

182
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,073
Okay. Fine, I'll tell you.

183
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,201
It was Hiram Lodge.

184
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,453
Not surprised.

185
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,331
Why would you agree?

186
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,669
Torching Pop's, which is right on top
of the Whyte Wyrm, my place.

187
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,589
Why would you risk a war
with the Serpents to help out Hiram Lodge?

188
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,674
A war?

189
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,178
Come on, the Serpents are a joke now.

190
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,765
Driving trucks and having babies.

191
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,517
You've gone soft.

192
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,770
Hiram said
that as soon as Pop's was razed,

193
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,816
Ghoulies would be able to take back
the town, get what we deserve.

194
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,947
You're gonna get what you deserve.

195
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,824
Fangs, the radio!

196
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,302
- I found something.
- What are we looking at?

197
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:45,139
According to these documents,
my father incorporated SoDale,

198
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,891
even though it's only a muddy field.

199
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,143
Great. So he's done with Riverdale?

200
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,771
On the contrary,
now that SoDale is legally a town,

201
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,024
he can petition the courts
to redraw its borders

202
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,610
and absorb all unincorporated lands.

203
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,613
He's going to annex
the former township of Riverdale,

204
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,740
claim eminent domain,
and grab it for himself.

205
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,910
Including the palladium mines.
He thinks this is the wild, wild west.

206
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,746
Let me take this back to the FBI office.

207
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,124
We'll see if this is legal. If it isn't,
we'll start building a case against him.

208
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,880
- It's Toni.
- Like we suspected,

209
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,341
Hiram paid the Ghoulie to burn down Pop's.

210
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,802
Not just Pop's but all the fires
that have been breaking out recently.

211
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,598
Hiram promised the Ghoulies
the burned husk of the town.

212
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,226
- All he cares about is...
- The mines.

213
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,103
I'm sorry.

214
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,439
Toni, Fangs, Archie.

215
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,860
Yet again, I find myself apologizing
for my father's actions.

216
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,988
Yeah, we don't want an apology.
We want justice.

217
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,740
Serpent justice.

218
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,954
- We'll take care of him.
- No offense,

219
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,165
but I don't think you're gonna be willing
to do what needs to be done.

220
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,626
Yes, we will.

221
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,004
Archie and I both will.

222
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,051
What are the Serpents supposed to do?
Sit back?

223
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:08,013
Fangs, what we need is someone
to go out and collect signatures.

224
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,599
- So we can reincorporate the town.
- Are you kidding me?

225
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,060
The Serpents don't run errands, Archie.

226
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,522
Of course not.
But this is a different kind of fighting.

227
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,316
As long as Riverdale is unincorporated,
we're sitting ducks.

228
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,986
I'm not sure we've done enough
to inspire the families

229
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,572
that Riverdale is still worth
resurrecting.

230
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,323
So we got to make our play.

231
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,744
That means getting 51% of people living
in our borders to sign an endorsement.

232
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,998
Fine. We'll rally the troops.

233
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,377
But if you two don't take care of Hiram,
we will.

234
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,420
Our way.

235
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,636
Toni's right.

236
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,181
Something drastic needs to happen.

237
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,603
I thought my dad would stop
after he blew up the mines, but...

238
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,855
he refuses to give up.

239
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,817
- He doesn't know how to.
- What do you wanna do?

240
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,112
The only thing that's left.

241
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,996
Let's say my father were to...

242
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:16,956
go missing.

243
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,796
Let's say he escaped from his jail cell.

244
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,716
Who would go looking for him?

245
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,218
Certainly not my mother.

246
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,931
And not Hermosa.
She feels betrayed by him too.

247
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,557
Sheriff Keller wouldn't.

248
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,436
And Betty would make sure
the FBI doesn't either.

249
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,190
We could take Hiram out
to the maple barrens.

250
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,693
It could be the last thing we do together.

251
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,073
Somehow that would be... fitting.

252
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,700
I'll call Tom.
Tell him to take a long lunch.

253
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,873
What's up?
We're in the middle of something.

254
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,585
Yeah, it looks like you're wrestling
with a Hiram-sized problem, am I right?

255
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,629
Far be it for me to intrude,

256
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:08,342
I thought you might be interested
in this smoking gun I managed to acquire.

257
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,635
What's on it?

258
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,803
Irrefutable proof.

259
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,529
Riverdale Field Office,
this is Agent Cooper.

260
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,409
Pretty Betty.

261
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,371
It's you.

262
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:43,085
Don't bother with a trace,
we won't be on long enough.

263
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,671
What do you want?

264
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:50,175
To congratulate you on graduation.

265
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,930
And to tell you that I have no plans
to come calling on you.

266
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,059
I hope you extend me the same courtesy.

267
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,228
You know I can't make that promise.

268
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,105
Pity...

269
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,900
Betty.

270
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,864
Hello?

271
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,201
Hello?

272
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,047
- How's the burger?
- Good.

273
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,259
- Well, the kitchen is still operational.
- True.

274
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,927
That's a good thing, right?

275
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,556
- Did you call your insurance company?
- Yes.

276
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,686
But they are not covering this.

277
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,604
Why?

278
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,774
Because the last couple of months,
I've had to choose

279
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,777
between paying my insurance premiums

280
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,071
or paying my waitresses.

281
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,074
I chose my waitresses.

282
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,162
Exactly what they teach you
not to do in business school.

283
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,792
What, be compassionate?
Care about your staff?

284
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,378
On top of which, did you see
what the Lodge Ledger published today?

285
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:13,258
No. But I was just thinking
about Hiram's fish-wrapper.

286
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,929
- What's it say?
- It's an editorial: "Out with the old.

287
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,808
Like the asteroid that wiped
the dinosaurs off the face of the Earth,

288
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,645
nature or fortune has struck again,
toppling another dinosaur:

289
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,522
Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

290
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,149
The struggling diner
has held on for far too long.

291
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:33,070
We can only hope that its charred remains
will be swept away quickly,

292
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,739
lost to the winds."

293
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,743
Hey, I've got an idea.

294
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,790
It won't bring back Pop's, but it would
hurt Hiram's stranglehold on the town.

295
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,376
And it might make us feel better.

296
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,755
If you're intrigued,
we'd have to act quickly

297
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,882
and move under the cover of darkness.

298
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,144
Let me guess.

299
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,646
You're not here to give me my phone call?

300
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,607
No. We're not.

301
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,691
Stand up.

302
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,241
The Fire Department's
on standby.

303
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:23,620
They'll arrive in time to keep the fire
from spreading, but this Ledger is toast.

304
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,414
Assuming you still wanna do this.

305
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,502
You know, Jughead, I pride myself
on always taking the high road.

306
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,797
But a person can only be pushed so far.

307
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,533
It's Archie.

308
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,871
I can't stop thinking
about what that Ghoulie said.

309
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,664
The Serpents are over.

310
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,666
The Serpents aren't over.

311
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,668
They've been on the back burner.

312
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,465
All I've been focused on is the school,
my guidance counseling work, Baby Anthony.

313
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,716
You and I,

314
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,760
we've been Serpents since birth,

315
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:24,556
and no dumb-ass, freaky-deaky Ghoulie
can take that away from us.

316
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
You're right.

317
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,312
But as queen of the Serpents,
I can and I should be doing more.

318
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,356
Every year, our numbers dwindle.

319
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,316
And if the town reincorporates,

320
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,027
I want the Serpents to be a big part
of its reconstruction.

321
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,696
I'm down. What are you thinking?

322
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,034
We start by taking the Serpents
off the roads and back into Riverdale.

323
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,246
Find them a gig
that pays just as well as truck driving.

324
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,458
And we start building up our ranks,
starting with Baby Anthony.

325
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,045
He'll be the symbol
of the next generation of ass-kickers.

326
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,507
Future king of the Serpents.

327
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,967
Exactly.

328
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,887
But we need a current one too.
And that's you, Fangs.

329
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,224
I'm here for it, Toni. All of it.

330
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,686
In unity, there is strength.

331
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,282
It's Veronica.

332
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,118
You ready, Daddy?

333
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,584
What is this?

334
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,132
A public execution?
What are you, my executioners?

335
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,634
You deserve death
for everything you've done.

336
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,388
But, no, Daddy, this is not an execution.

337
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,307
This is an exile.

338
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,017
Yours.

339
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,311
After we show you something.

340
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,705
Where'd you get that?

341
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,002
- Reggie?
- Yeah, it was me.

342
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,755
The point is, we have it.

343
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,256
We've all seen it.

344
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,676
Irrefutable proof that you're a murderer.

345
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,263
You can't wriggle your way
out of this one, Daddy.

346
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:32,768
In one hour exactly, Betty will turn
that video over to the FBI.

347
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,270
I'd start walking, Daddy.

348
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,523
And I wouldn't stop for a long, long time.

349
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,692
You're turning against your own blood?

350
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,613
I blame Archie. This is his influence.

351
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,322
Don't.

352
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,740
We broke up.

353
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,659
This is all me.

354
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,413
What about my possessions?

355
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,083
We'll sell what we can,

356
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,712
use whatever money we make from it
to rebuild Pop's and the town.

357
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,673
Tick tock, Daddy.

358
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,511
Tick tock.

359
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,961
So, uh, tonight got me to thinking.

360
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,633
What would you say about being
my deputy full-time, son?

361
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,344
That would be an honor, Dad.

362
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,304
I can't.

363
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,056
Because I've decided

364
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,101
once the school year's over,
I wanna give Broadway another shot.

365
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,812
I've been thinking about it
since Josie visited.

366
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,856
It's something I've gotta do now,

367
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,025
or I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

368
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,779
- To new beginnings.
- To new beginnings.

369
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,618
I just drove past the town hall,
and it is a firetrap.

370
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,454
So we'll host the community meeting
at the El Royale.

371
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,416
- How's it going with the signatures?
- We're not at 51% yet,

372
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,459
but we got a crew out
pounding the pavement.

373
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,669
Okay. Great.

374
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,046
But a lot of the Serpents
have been reporting back.

375
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,550
People are asking what kind of town
the new Riverdale's gonna be.

376
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,303
And they'll wanna know
before they agree to reincorporate.

377
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,306
Like, is there gonna be a mayor?
And if so, who?

378
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,016
I've been turning that over too.

379
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,144
I know who I would vote for.

380
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,063
You, Toni.

381
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,649
- Would you do it?
- What?

382
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,694
Mayor? I mean, Archie, I can't.

383
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,322
- I don't have the bandwidth.
- I understand.

384
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,533
- Fangs?
- Hell, no.

385
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,120
- I just got crowned Serpent King.
- Oh, congratulations, bro.

386
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:01,208
Why don't you focus on getting people
to the El Royale for the town hall.

387
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,754
And we'll have answers
for people's questions, Toni. I promise.

388
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,270
Miss Blossom?

389
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,730
Miss Blossom.

390
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,566
Look what I found.

391
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,487
Skeletons, Nana. Human skeletons.

392
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,823
Our mines are choked
with God-and-Jason-knows-how-many.

393
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,785
Brittania and I discovered
a veritable boneyard.

394
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,329
Since you seem to know
where all the bodies are buried,

395
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,164
I'm assuming you know about these.

396
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,626
Yes, I was wondering
if they'd ever be found.

397
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,210
The Forgotten.

398
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,338
The Forgotten?

399
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:02,519
It all began with an ancestor of ours,

400
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,938
one Abigail Blossom.

401
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,441
The year was 1890.

402
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:13,697
Thornhill still stood, of course,
but it was a girls' school then.

403
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:18,118
Riverdale was a hateful
and backward place then.

404
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,746
The townspeople were suspicious
of Abigail,

405
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,001
who had no husband
and no intention of taking one.

406
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,754
They'd harassed Abigail
and the girls in her care for months.

407
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:34,676
They knew there was palladium
to be found in the mines under her groves

408
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,678
and wanted to buy them from her,

409
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,596
but she refused.

410
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,851
So they decided to steal it instead.

411
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:50,859
They came to Thornhill,
armed with pitchforks and torches.

412
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,070
No!

413
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,073
No! No! No!

414
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,326
- This way.
- Move!

415
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,374
Oh, they had it all planned out.

416
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,626
They accused her of being a witch.

417
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,922
And they burned her at the stake,

418
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,176
in the groves surrounding Thornhill.

419
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,769
Who, Nana?

420
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,815
Who were these vicious hooligans,
these killers?

421
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,777
Brace yourself, child.

422
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,364
The primary conspirators were
the ancestors

423
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,367
of your so-called compatriots.

424
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,411
Archibald Andrews,

425
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:48,333
Jedediah Jones and Beatrice Cooper.

426
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:54,881
With her dying words,
she cursed them and the others,

427
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:58,093
damning them to tragedy as well.

428
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:02,430
After her death,
the townspeople claimed the mines

429
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,100
and began to dig for palladium.

430
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,684
But there was a collapse,

431
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:10,063
killing and entombing an entire generation

432
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,982
of Riverdale's fathers and sons.

433
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,945
Some say the collapse was caused

434
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,863
by Abigail's curse.

435
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,076
- Nana, how do you know all this?
- Why...

436
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,913
it's written in Abigail's journal.

437
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,666
Would you like to read it, child?

438
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,044
I shouldn't have called you, Grandpa.

439
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,964
It wasn't my intention
that you would come up from Florida.

440
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:41,261
The worst part of all this is
that I feel like I've let you down.

441
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,763
What are you talking about?

442
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:47,892
You defied your father
and took over a struggling business.

443
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,563
And don't forget,
I know the debt you assumed

444
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,565
when you took over the diner.

445
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,568
You've been paying it down every month.

446
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,862
None of that matters
if we can't pay for repairs.

447
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,490
We'll try to get
some of Hiram's leftovers.

448
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,868
And I'll cover the rest
with my retirement money.

449
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,996
What? Grandpa, no,
I am not letting you do that.

450
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:13,126
I'd be doing it for me as much as you.
I miss the adrenaline of working.

451
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,503
I miss my customers.

452
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,131
So I'm giving you my nest egg,

453
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,008
on the condition...

454
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,137
that you let me come back to Pop's
and work with you.

455
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,390
Grandpa, I would love that.

456
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,311
We could propose a civil council.

457
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,189
It's a system that works and it's fair.

458
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,400
If fair is the criteria,
then we should govern by committee.

459
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,403
We can hold town meetings
for every big decision.

460
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,947
It's purely democratic,
everyone will get an equal say.

461
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,532
That would be anarchy.

462
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:48,161
What if we had a mayor who had to answer
to a council? Best of both worlds.

463
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:51,331
I think a mayor is a nonstarter
for a lot of people,

464
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,333
after the way my father abused his power.

465
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,919
How ironic yet fitting.

466
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,838
The descendants of those
who committed Riverdale's original sin

467
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,256
debating its future.

468
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,258
Well, I refuse to allow you four

469
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,637
to perpetuate any further cycles
of violence and bloodshed.

470
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,516
What are you talking about?

471
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,521
So, to be clear,

472
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,898
- none of my ancestors were involved?
- No.

473
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,275
The same can't be said
for your three conspirators

474
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,610
who killed my dear Abigail.

475
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:26,032
Therefore, I'm demanding a formal apology
and acknowledgment of this travesty.

476
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,659
Publicly and immediately.

477
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:31,204
Cheryl, this story really is tragic.

478
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,873
But those are our ancestors, not us.

479
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,168
We need everyone's support
at tomorrow's meeting.

480
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,712
If we lead with this crazy story,

481
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,216
it might distract people
from the task at hand, reincorporation.

482
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,844
I've spent years
atoning for the sins of my ancestors.

483
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,888
And now you want me
to forget about it and move on?

484
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,391
Only until the town is stable.

485
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:55,186
Cheryl, please, this is Riverdale's
one chance to be reborn.

486
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,232
Reborn? This town sits
over a vast graveyard of dead miners.

487
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,360
The roots of the trees in my groves have,
over time, become entwined

488
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,613
with those corpses.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

489
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,200
For decades, the trees have been
nourished by the poisonous dead.

490
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,203
My sap, my syrup,
the very lifeblood of Riverdale

491
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,832
has been polluted by the remains
of so many fathers and sons.

492
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,626
The only chance
this town has of being reborn

493
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,714
is for you to come clean
and beg for my, my forgiveness.

494
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:28,011
See you at the meeting.
And I pray you do the right thing.

495
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,810
Okay, today, our families
and neighbors are going to decide

496
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,062
on whether or not
to reincorporate this town.

497
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,189
Whether Riverdale lives...

498
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,651
or whether Riverdale dies.

499
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,112
Regardless, we will be ready to publish.

500
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,615
But not as The Blue and Gold.

501
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:54,495
We are now The Riverdale Choice,
a new, free press for all of Riverdale.

502
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,331
Whatever happens in our town,

503
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:00,585
we are gonna be there to report on it
truthfully and without bias.

504
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,839
And whoever is in charge,
we will hold them accountable,

505
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,966
even if they're our friends.

506
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,385
Especially if they're our friends.

507
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,263
Okay, we have a town meeting
to cover. Let's go.

508
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:19,604
Reginald, I've been thinking about
your idea for a casino in Riverdale,

509
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:23,191
and I think we should go for it.

510
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,568
Really? What about New York?

511
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:30,531
We could go back to New York
and be two nameless, faceless traders

512
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,908
on Wall Street, yes.

513
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:36,371
Or we could stay in Riverdale
and be king and queen of the roost,

514
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,916
working for ourselves, calling the shots.

515
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,418
You're preaching to the choir.

516
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:46,297
And I was thinking maybe we can use
Pearls and Posh as a cover.

517
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,925
We may not even have to do that.

518
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:55,723
Could I get everyone's attention?
We'd like to begin the proceedings.

519
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,438
Some of you knew my father.

520
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,941
And he believed in Riverdale,

521
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:09,070
not because it was perfect,
but because he saw the potential in it.

522
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,658
We're not looking
to reincorporate a town that was

523
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:18,037
but a town that might one day be
with the proper leadership.

524
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,416
Which is why, as of tonight,
we're hoping that it won't be a mayor

525
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:25,211
who leads us into the future,
but instead a Council of Four

526
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:29,257
- who will guide us every step of the way.
- Halt. I've heard enough.

527
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,720
And who, pray tell, will comprise
this Council of Four Narcissists?

528
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,432
Let me guess.
You, Betty, Veronica, and Jughead.

529
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,685
Actually, we were going
to propose the council be...

530
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,563
Tabitha Tate,

531
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,273
Toni Topaz,

532
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,442
Alice Smith,

533
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,111
and my Uncle Frank.

534
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,779
I see.

535
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,283
And what about the past, Archie?

536
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,286
Tonight's not about the past,
but I promise you...

537
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,412
No.

538
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,415
No more empty promises.

539
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,335
Let the official public record show
from this moment on,

540
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:10,423
Thornhill and her lands shall cede
from the corrupt township of Riverdale.

541
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:14,427
Whatever happens tonight,
you lot will have no jurisdiction over it

542
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,846
- or its blessed inhabitants.
- Cheryl, come on.

543
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,929
Nay, cousin.

544
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,599
What is decreed is decreed.

545
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,310
Ta-ta. Come along, Brittania.

546
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:32,487
Just to be clear, these four nominees
have deep roots in Riverdale.

547
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,240
They'll fight to make it better, stronger,
and more inclusive than ever.

548
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,535
They will each swear an oath
to put Riverdale's collective needs

549
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,953
before any single individual.

550
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,874
Is there anyone here tonight
that opposes these four nominees?

551
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,506
All in favor to reincorporate
the township of Riverdale

552
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,840
under this Council of Four.

553
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,011
Unanimous.

554
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,308
Along with the signatures collected,
the ayes have it.

555
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,937
Riverdale is officially back on the map.

556
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,993
At the risk of putting the cart
before the horse,

557
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,413
Reggie and I have an idea
for Riverdale, a big idea.

558
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,457
That we think you're gonna love.

559
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,168
- Okay. What is it?
- Picture, if you will,

560
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,463
a stunning, full-service, white-glove,

561
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,841
family-friendly casino
within Riverdale's borders.

562
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,136
Which will provide
a slew of new jobs for our residents,

563
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,471
as well as a fresh, robust cash flow.

564
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:45,351
With our expertise and your support,
our little town could be the next...

565
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,186
Atlantic City.

566
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,983
So you're wanting to turn Riverdale
into the modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah?

567
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,736
We really appreciate your enthusiasm.

568
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,531
We have traffic lights
and potholes to fix first.

569
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,117
Not to mention Pop's.

570
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,202
What we're saying is that we're intrigued.

571
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,497
But how about you bring a full proposal
to next month's meeting

572
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,332
and we'll take it from there?

573
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,336
Okay. See you next month.

574
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,261
So...

575
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,515
Riverdale lives to fight another day.

576
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,187
- Nice job, Arch.
- Yeah, we'll see.

577
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,735
- What about Cheryl? Should we be worried?
- Nah, she'll come around.

578
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,529
What are you doing later?

579
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
How did it go?

580
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,285
Was our Abigail avenged?

581
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,329
- Hardly, Nana.
- Oh...

582
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,664
They don't give a whit
about the sins of the past.

583
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,169
- Will Riverdale ever learn?
- Perhaps.

584
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,712
But they will need help.

585
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,132
And Abigail must be honored.

586
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,384
What's that?

587
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,221
The last words she ever spoke

588
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,682
as she was being burned alive
at the stake.

589
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,935
You mean, the curse?

590
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,104
Speak the speech, child.

591
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,107
It will be a fitting tribute
to our ancestor.

592
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:26,285
It's only fitting that these words spoken
at the end of one Blossom chapter...

593
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,414
shall be uttered as a new one unfurls.

594
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:36,003
From this day on, Thornhill will
no longer be a home to a ministry

595
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:41,592
but to a school modeled after Abigail's,
an academy for lost and wayward girls.

596
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,763
As Abigail herself once said these words:

597
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,728
"Archibald Andrews,
Jedediah Jones, and Beatrice Cooper,

598
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,147
I repudiate you with my dying breath.

599
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,525
And in Satan's name, I curse you.

600
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,778
Burn me,
but you will never escape my wrath,

601
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,779
nor Satan's.

602
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:05,700
The unchained elements of the power
of darkness are lying in ambush.

603
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,951
Beware.

604
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:10,496
My revenge will strike down you
and your accursed houses.

605
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:14,000
And I will bathe in the blood
of your sons and daughters.

606
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,378
Immortal, I shall return again and again

607
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,755
to torment and destroy you."

608
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,173
...and destroy you!

609
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,876
- What do you guys think?
- I think it's your best work yet.

610
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,422
Thanks, Alice.
But, I mean, it's just a plywood sign.

611
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,798
Nah.

612
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,759
It's everything you've done this year.

613
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,441
That's bizarre. RIV weatherman
didn't call for wind today.

614
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,653
Oof. This wind...

615
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,824
Yeah. It feels like someone's walking
on my grave. Come on.

616
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,080
Very good.

617
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,458
From a classroom to a boiler room.
Only in Riverdale.

618
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:44,382
- How are we looking back here, partner?
- Well, it's not Caesars Palace, but...

619
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,801
we'll get there.

620
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,554
Of that, Reggie, I have no doubt.

621
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,611
Betty.

622
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,034
I...

623
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,745
I wanna try again.

624
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,455
Us.

625
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,459
Not as friends with benefits, but...

626
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,128
But for real.

627
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,088
All in.

628
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,136
I mean, can we try again?

629
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,054
We can.

630
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,475
I wanna be with you too, Arch.

631
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,559
Can you hear that?

632
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,479
Yeah. What is that?

633
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,815
The clock?

634
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,286
- Betty.
- What? What is it?

635
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:40,664
Tick, tick, boom.
