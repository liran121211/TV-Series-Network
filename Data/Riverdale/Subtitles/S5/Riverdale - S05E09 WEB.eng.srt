1
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:14,889
The science-fiction writer
Arthur C. Clarke said this about aliens:

2
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,683
"Two possibilities exist.

3
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,895
Either we are alone in the universe
or we are not.

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,898
Both are equally terrifying."

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,115
Mom, it's almost time for the game.

6
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,375
Polly's out there.

7
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,838
We don't know
if that was her blood on the phone booth.

8
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,382
She called us from it
a half hour before we got there.

9
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,800
Who else's blood would it be?

10
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,471
We'll find out when the FBI calls me
with their analysis.

11
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:59,809
Maybe get back into your support group
with all those other moms.

12
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,207
Let's go, Derek! Go, Derek!
Come on, Derek!

13
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,954
All right, bring it in.

14
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,836
We lost again.

15
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,214
We could have been practicing
for Regionals

16
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,299
instead of wasting our time here.

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,219
I couldn't agree more, Cassandra.

18
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,306
Could not agree more.

19
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,854
All right, that was another tough one.

20
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,107
But the Ravens
are number two in the league.

21
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,860
You fought hard out there.
Keep fighting. We'll break through.

22
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,114
While I do believe
Coach Andrews is the best motivator

23
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,990
a gridiron gang could ask for,

24
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,702
as your de facto team owner,
what can I do to incentivize you?

25
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,124
How about 10 grand?

26
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,627
To whichever Bulldog scores first
this season.

27
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,921
Yeah.

28
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,506
- All right?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,347
- You okay, Derek?
- I'll be all right.

30
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,600
- It sucks to lose. I'm giving it my all.
- I hear you.

31
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:26,604
There was no better player than you
out on that field today.

32
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,277
What do we do? Push them more?

33
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,989
I'm already running them ragged.

34
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,366
Not to mention zero fan support.

35
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,535
The Bulldogs were supposed
to inspire the town.

36
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,247
Riverdale was supposed to rally behind
the Bulldogs. No one comes to our games.

37
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,251
In that case, I'll get the town
to back our Bulldogs again.

38
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,420
Just keep those kids motivated.

39
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,048
And what about me?

40
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,051
Don't coaches need motivation too?

41
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,849
Chin up, Andrews.

42
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,272
The incidents
go back decades, Samm.

43
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,567
Dozens of people seeing things
they can't explain. Even support groups.

44
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,278
Slow down.
You're writing about aliens now?

45
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,156
It's not just about aliens,
it's about personal trauma.

46
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,992
If I'm right,
it's about a town's collective trauma.

47
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,828
Could you take the idea to Scribner's?

48
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,290
- Yeah. I'll let you know what they say.
- Thank you, I appreciate it.

49
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:41,262
Tabitha, how do you feel about
Pop's hosting a pancake breakfast

50
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,432
so that folks can mingle
with the new Riverdale Bulldogs?

51
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,852
Sounds fun. And if it brings in
warm bodies, then great.

52
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,354
Amazing.

53
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:54,859
And what if, hypothetically, Pop's became
the official sponsor of the Bulldogs?

54
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,112
Let's give it a shot.

55
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,989
I like supporting underdogs.

56
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,325
I will order the pancake mix
and the syrup.

57
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,537
Oh, no. No. Don't order the syrup.
I have a special supplier for that.

58
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,874
I cannot donate
my precious maple resource to help fund

59
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,461
that collection of tatterdemalions
you call a football team.

60
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:17,924
And the Vixens can no longer continue
cheering for the Bad News Bulldogs.

61
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,551
Please, stick around for one more game.

62
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,637
And maybe help get more people
in the stands.

63
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,598
My Vixens are cheerleaders,
not boosters, Archie.

64
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,934
Fine. I'll do it myself.

65
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,979
Hi, Miss Bell. Can you turn this on?

66
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,567
Attention.
This is Coach Andrews.

67
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,613
A bunch of your classmates are out there
busting their asses on the football field

68
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,573
to represent this school and to represent

69
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,575
each and every one of you.

70
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,704
Why don't you show some school spirit
and support your team?

71
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:52,667
Starting with the free pancake breakfast
that Pop's is hosting tomorrow morning.

72
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,835
Give them your support.

73
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,172
And, hell, you might even get
something out of it yourselves.

74
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,886
And what about the Vixens?

75
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,471
One more game.

76
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,518
I'll even come out of retirement to give
the people something they'd like to see.

77
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,769
Namely, moi.

78
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,776
First, there's something broken
I need to fix.

79
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,489
And don't forget to turn in
your assignments on the way out.

80
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,242
Thank you.

81
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,873
Good job. Thank you.

82
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:55,146
Glen. Did you get the blood results
from the phone booth back?

83
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,022
I did.

84
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,068
The recovered blood is AB negative.

85
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,527
The rarest type.

86
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,279
Under 1% of the population.

87
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,239
And a match for Polly.

88
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,201
So she...

89
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,327
She's really...?

90
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,037
I'm so sorry, Betty.

91
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,626
No, you're not.

92
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,713
If you had cared at all about me
or my sister,

93
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,924
you would have done something to help me.

94
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:26,469
- Betty, look, I realize you're upset...
- Screw you, Glen.

95
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,568
I must admit, it is a bit disturbing.

96
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,197
Waldo, a kid is held captive
by mole people,

97
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,826
only to escape and be abducted
by a family of Mothmen,

98
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,329
who operate on him in a spaceship,
in graphic detail.

99
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,833
- Doesn't ring any alarm bells for you?
- The child survives.

100
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,835
He's found on the side of the highway.

101
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,463
- What do we know about Lerman?
- Good student. Average grades.

102
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,133
Any trouble at home?

103
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,386
He has sustained
a substantial number of injuries.

104
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:12,974
A broken arm, a black eye.
He was on crutches for a while.

105
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,395
I know what you're thinking.

106
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,772
But I spoke to Lerman and his parents.

107
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,317
- They couldn't be nicer people.
- He's just accident-prone?

108
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,279
- What about the story?
- Some kids get hurt a lot.

109
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,655
And, yes,

110
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,659
sometimes a story is just a story.

111
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,041
Order up!

112
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:44,046
- Behold. 'Tis the nectar of the gods.
- Ah. Amazing. Thank you again.

113
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,718
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

114
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,013
We're feeling optimistic
about the rest of the season.

115
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,682
Your son plays a huge part in that,
which is why, Derek,

116
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,601
I want you to be captain of the team.

117
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,021
And what's the team gonna do
for my son, Coach Andrews?

118
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:03,983
- Um, I'm not sure I understand.
- Derek's a good player.

119
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,903
Football could be
his ticket out of this town.

120
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,447
- He could get a scholarship...
- Mom, chill.

121
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,033
I have to think of my son's future, coach.

122
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,410
Not just your team's.

123
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,495
Excuse me.

124
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,373
No, I understand.

125
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,667
So sorry to interrupt.

126
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,711
Coach, we have a situation.

127
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,972
I take it you didn't come
for the hotcakes.

128
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,056
No.

129
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,894
I'm here on behalf of the Greater Rockland
County Football League.

130
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,272
The other teams in the conference
and our commissioner saw fit

131
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,399
to send me as a representative.

132
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,276
We're in agreement.

133
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,656
We'd like for the Bulldogs to withdraw
from the league, like, yesterday.

134
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,242
You guys suck.

135
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,245
Screw you, Reggie.
Riverdale has a right to play.

136
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,914
Come on.
The Bulldogs are an embarrassment.

137
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,792
They're tainting the league's prestige.

138
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,212
So can we tell the league
you're withdrawing?

139
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:10,508
Like hell. I want the names
of every member of this so-called league.

140
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,968
Doesn't it kill you...

141
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,137
to watch the Bulldogs lose
week after week?

142
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,224
Yeah, well,
it's not all about winning, Reg.

143
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,811
Keep telling yourself that, loser.

144
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,648
Loser, loser, loser.

145
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,787
You wanna talk about it?

146
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,791
A few days ago, you were getting married
and having a kid.

147
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,711
- Now we're moving you out.
- It was my decision.

148
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,878
You know?

149
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,301
Maybe you're right. Maybe... I'm not
the kind of guy who deserves a family.

150
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:59,056
Now hold on. You don't really believe
that you don't deserve happiness, do you?

151
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,479
I actually don't wanna talk about it.

152
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,235
Given how invested you are
in seeing Riverdale High

153
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,530
fail on all fronts, I find it hard
to believe you're not behind

154
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,532
the league's attempt to oust the Bulldogs.

155
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,368
All I know about the Bulldogs is
that they're garbage

156
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,163
- and they haven't even scored this season.
- They will.

157
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,041
- Against your precious Stallions.
- Oh, please.

158
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,836
We'll be wiping Bulldog blood
off our cleats for weeks.

159
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,548
You seem so sure.

160
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,968
How about a wager?

161
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,219
What are the terms?

162
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:41,223
If your Stallions keep
my Bulldogs off the scoreboard,

163
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,644
we'll withdraw from the league,
voluntarily.

164
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,854
If, however, we do score,

165
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:51,442
you'll have to convince your friend,
the commissioner, and his Legion of Doom

166
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,028
to stop trying to muscle out the Bulldogs.

167
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,739
I will take that bet.

168
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,492
Great.

169
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,673
Lerman, could you hang back for a sec?

170
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,097
Story's great.

171
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:26,310
It's very vivid. It's intense.
I wanted to ask you what inspired it.

172
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:31,440
- Uh... Just a series of dreams I had.
- Really? Recurring?

173
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,902
Yes. It... Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

174
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:38,823
Some experts believe that stories
about aliens and the like are

175
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,910
really about traumas
that people have experienced.

176
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,204
And these stories are cries for help.

177
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,582
You know... What...? What do you mean?

178
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,213
I mean, is this story real, Lerman?
Any part of it?

179
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,632
Did someone hurt you,
like what you wrote about,

180
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,010
- or tie you up or keep you locked up?
- Mr. Jones,

181
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,055
it's... It's just a story, okay?

182
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,475
I... I never should have written it.
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,519
I'm sorry, I have to go.

184
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,776
Sweet cousin. What a surprise.

185
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,906
Any news on your sister?

186
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,452
Yeah. As a matter of fact,
that's why I'm here.

187
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,416
When Jason first disappeared,

188
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,628
for a long time, no one knew
where he was or what had happened to him.

189
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,840
But when you learned that he had died,

190
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,217
was it helpful to know the truth?

191
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,515
To say it was soul-crushing
would be an understatement.

192
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,022
So, what if you'd never learned the truth?

193
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,942
If you had had hope
that he might still be alive?

194
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:02,907
When I learned the truth,
I was able to grieve for my brother.

195
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,867
From my experience,

196
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,245
it is better to know the truth.

197
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,915
And make your peace with it.

198
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,422
Does this mean Polly's...?

199
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,971
I don't know what it'll do to my mom.

200
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,652
Why aren't you guys dressed for practice?

201
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,654
Derek transferred.

202
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,241
He got recruited to play
for Stonewall Prep.

203
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,535
We're doomed.

204
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,792
As much as I hate Stonewall Prep,

205
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,710
I can't blame Derek.

206
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,004
Enrolling there,
playing for the Stallions...

207
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,757
it's his best shot at college.

208
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,385
And they're a team that wins games.

209
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,431
The Bulldogs will be too.
You've only just relaunched them.

210
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,892
Not to mention we're down a player.

211
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,395
The league won't even let us
on the field with ten.

212
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,816
The Bulldogs just need
a little motivation.

213
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,735
Something to get them energized.

214
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:29,243
Luckily, I just came up with
one of my genius ideas

215
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:33,163
that will rally the troops
and maybe even recruit some new ones.

216
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,718
Mom.

217
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,804
Mom.

218
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,061
We got the blood results back.

219
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,773
Is it Polly's?

220
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,570
No.

221
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,992
No, it...

222
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,245
It was O positive. It wasn't a match.

223
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,378
Oh, thank God.

224
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,840
Thank God.

225
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,009
Oh, thank you, Betty.

226
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,447
Hey! You're awake.

227
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,450
Perfect timing. I ordered
a platter of cold cuts from Pop's.

228
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,618
Would you get it?

229
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,912
What's happening?

230
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,457
I decided you were right about me
getting back into the support group.

231
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,418
I'm hosting today. Would you mind
running to get the cold cuts?

232
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,798
Yeah, no. Of course.

233
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,302
- What's the buzz, Waldo?
- This him?

234
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,431
Mr. Jones, these are the Logans.
Lerman's parents.

235
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,643
Hi.

236
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,854
They've come in to discuss
a conversation you had with their son.

237
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,983
In what world do you think
that it's appropriate

238
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,194
to encourage these wild fantasies
that Lerman is obsessed with?

239
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,990
Death and aliens and underground monsters?

240
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,408
What's wrong with you?

241
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,410
Well, I'm sorry, I...

242
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,121
I had figured it was my responsibility
as Lerman's teacher.

243
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:41,250
The story he wrote might have been
alluding to some troubles at home.

244
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,921
Then why didn't you come to us?
Instead, you ambush our child?

245
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,506
Mr. and Mrs. Logan,

246
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,259
Mr. Jones's behavior
was wildly inappropriate.

247
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,970
I can promise you,
it'll never happen again.

248
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:56,890
Oh, we know it won't.
We don't want him teaching our child.

249
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,352
- Wait. I didn't reach out to you...
- Not a problem at all.

250
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,147
We'll move Lerman
to another English class.

251
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,735
How dare you break protocol
in such a reckless manner!

252
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,778
I had already vetted the Logans.

253
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,948
I know. No, I'm sorry.
I felt like something was off.

254
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,992
My instinct was something was going on.

255
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,410
One more misstep...

256
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,121
I mean, even just a little one.

257
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,707
...and you're done at my school.

258
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,668
Kevin, Fangs.

259
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,296
Thank you both
for agreeing to this tête-à-tête.

260
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,548
Toni may never forgive me,

261
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,259
but I will never forgive myself

262
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,721
if I don't try to repair
what my antics have torn asunder.

263
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,057
Namely, hashtag "Kangs."

264
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,226
Your games brought up deeper issues
between Kevin and I.

265
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,729
- Agreed.
- See? Consensus.

266
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,400
- Go on, Fangs.
- Now, you've never been all-in, Kev.

267
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,611
You've always, always held back.

268
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,529
I don't know if that's because of me

269
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,281
or because you're ashamed of being gay.

270
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,076
I am not ashamed of being gay.

271
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,120
You go to the woods,
you hook up with anonymous strangers.

272
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,290
You don't wanna be in a real relationship
with a real gay guy.

273
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,958
Fangs, don't.

274
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,002
You're not me.

275
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,171
You don't know my experience, okay?

276
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,507
We were about to get married, Kevin.

277
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,468
I wanna know everything about you.
The good and the bad.

278
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,178
I think it's too late for that.

279
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,013
- Kevin, please.
- I gotta go.

280
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,974
Um, Cheryl, please butt out of our lives.

281
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,441
What, are you having a party?
And I wasn't invited?

282
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,906
- No, it's for my mom's support group.
- How's she doing?

283
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,371
There have been developments...

284
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,707
in Polly's case. Um...

285
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,042
Apparently...

286
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,089
the blood they recovered
at the phone booth...

287
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:58,178
is a match for hers,
which means most likely that, um...

288
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,722
Oh, God. Betty, I'm so sorry.

289
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,934
And the worst part is,
she disappeared four weeks ago,

290
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:07,437
which means she has or had been alive...

291
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:12,109
that entire time,
somewhere along the Lonely Highway.

292
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,236
So I just didn't do enough.

293
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,115
Hey, I met someone that lives
on the Lonely Highway.

294
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,700
He's an eccentric kook,

295
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,077
but he sees a lot
of what goes on out there.

296
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,205
Maybe he might have seen or heard
something about the missing girls?

297
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,751
If you want, I can put this tray on ice
and I can take you to go meet him.

298
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,504
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

299
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,217
Bring it in.

300
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,888
What's the point in practicing?
We don't have enough players.

301
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,514
The Bulldogs are a team.

302
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,017
We play for each other
and the love of the game.

303
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,103
Yoo-hoo. Got room for one more?

304
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,524
I wanna introduce you to a friend of mine
who plays professional football

305
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,818
for a little team called
the New York Goliaths.

306
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,528
Holy crap.

307
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,738
It's T Dub.

308
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,742
Wow. A pleasure to meet you.
You're one hell of a player.

309
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,786
I appreciate it.
Heard you're one hell of a coach.

310
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,915
- How are you even here?
- Ronnie and I go way back.

311
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,710
T Dub was one of my most loyal clients
when I was selling jewelry in New York.

312
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,213
Hey, is it cool
if I say a few words to the team?

313
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,380
Yeah. Please.

314
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,927
Some of you have seen me play
for the Goliaths.

315
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,804
But my career started off
in a small town just like Riverdale.

316
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,140
With a coach who pushed me
to be what I could be.

317
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:29,978
He believed in me.
Just like Coach Andrews believes in you.

318
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,149
But you gotta be the ones
to make it happen on the field.

319
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,276
You're not underdogs.

320
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,946
- You're the damn Bulldogs!
- Yeah.

321
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,240
- Y'all ready to prove these haters wrong?
- Yeah!

322
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,328
You must be Britta.
Heard you got a cannon.

323
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,373
Come on. Let's see it.

324
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,087
Might be the shot in the arm we needed.
I wish T Dub could suit up for us.

325
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,257
- We're short a player.
- Oh, Archiekins, not for long.

326
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,385
Behold. A group of Bulldogs to be.

327
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,684
Hey! Who wants to play football?

328
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,811
Yeah!

329
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,397
We have a problem.

330
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,692
The interest in the Bulldogs is growing,
not waning.

331
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:23,115
I do not want people rallying around
this team or that school or that town.

332
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:27,035
I want you to target their weakest link
and knock some heads.

333
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,579
We don't need to go there.

334
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,293
We're gonna crush the Bulldogs
on the field. Fair and square. Easy.

335
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,005
Your loyalty lies with me at Stonewall.

336
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,174
I'm not gonna break
some kid's legs for no reason.

337
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:42,925
Yeah.

338
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,635
Yeah.

339
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,472
Consider yourself benched, Reggie.

340
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,727
I'll be leading the Stallions
into battle against Riverdale High.

341
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,650
So be it. I'll be standing
with the Bulldogs then.

342
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,407
What were you doing out here?

343
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,867
Just working on a book.

344
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,079
So the old-timer that owns this place
has been here for decades.

345
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,999
Mr. Dreyfuss, hi.

346
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,544
- Jughead Jones. You remember me?
- Of course I do.

347
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,882
Great. This is Betty Cooper,
a friend of mine from the FBI.

348
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,718
- We were hoping you could help us.
- Come on up.

349
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,306
We're 100% certain
that my sister made a call

350
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,060
from the pay phone on the Lonely Highway,
but when we got there, it was destroyed.

351
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,021
Shredded? Like a tin can?

352
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,733
Exactly, yeah. Have you seen that before?

353
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:43,528
Back in the summer of '77
and again in '82.

354
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,783
I know what happened to your sister.
She's had an encounter.

355
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,118
Yes, right, but with who?

356
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,995
The Mothmen.

357
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,040
I'm sorry. The Mothmen?

358
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,752
What makes you say that?

359
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,629
The phone booth.

360
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,464
You see,

361
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,968
their ships use antimatter fusion reactors

362
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,888
that create a gravity field

363
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:13,934
that allows them to levitate,
like a balloon.

364
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:18,355
But anything that gets caught
in that stasis, well, it...

365
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,983
It gets crushed
like it's made out of papier-mâché.

366
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,486
I knew our friends were back in town.

367
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,030
I've been picking up their chatter
on my radios.

368
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,453
That was a colossal waste of time.

369
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,914
A lot of people believe this.
There is some evidence.

370
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,582
My sister went missing.

371
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,878
She was taken by someone, not some thing.
What are you even saying?

372
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:46,007
Things happen, especially in Riverdale,
that you and I can't explain.

373
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,093
Sometimes there isn't
a logical explanation.

374
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,430
- Sometimes unexplained phenomenon...
- No. Someone is...

375
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,808
kidnapping, torturing and murdering women.

376
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,435
That's not a phenomenon.

377
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,978
It's just pure evil.

378
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,480
But I'll be damned
if I let it happen to anyone else.

379
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,816
Can you hurry up?
I need to get back to Riverdale.

380
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,504
- Because I care about you.
- You don't live here.

381
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,131
You deserted us.

382
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,424
Being a real sister

383
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,343
doesn't mean coming in
and telling me how to live my life.

384
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,637
Especially when you don't know
anything about it.

385
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,931
My daughter is alive!

386
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,851
- She called.
- -Betty, you have to help me.

387
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,520
I ran as fast as I could.
You have to come get me.

388
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:45,150
Polly, I wanna tell you that
I love you and that I'm here for you.

389
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,486
Just please, please, please come home.

390
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,399
Hey, how's it going?

391
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,776
Good, good.

392
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,571
I haven't seen you in here before.

393
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,449
Name's Shane. I'm visiting from L.A.

394
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,576
Oh. Well...

395
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,957
Guess it's true
what they say about L.A. guys.

396
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,667
Oh? What's that?

397
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,379
That they're... hot.

398
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,299
What do they say about guys in Riverdale?

399
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,470
Why don't you tell me?

400
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,015
What are you doing?

401
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,143
Uh, sorry. I misread the situation.
I thought...

402
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,145
- You thought I was like you?
- No.

403
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,522
- That I wanted you?
- No.

404
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,650
- Think I came here to be groped by you?
- No! No.

405
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,643
- What the hell?
- Hey. What are you doing?

406
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,438
Saving your life,
whether you want it saved or not.

407
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,023
Get the hell out of here.

408
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:55,155
You're leaving these girls alone
and never coming back here again.

409
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,198
Hey, these girls are looking to trick.

410
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,747
Tell your dirtbag friends
the party's over.

411
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,919
Put a little ice on it.

412
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,215
Those bruises will settle down
in a few days.

413
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,052
And keep those cuts clean.

414
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,849
- Thanks, Dad.
- You're a grown man.

415
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,270
And, as your father, I'm...

416
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,358
I'm terrified for you right now.

417
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:33,943
What's going on?

418
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,156
I think...

419
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,160
I'm ashamed of myself.

420
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,207
Of being gay.

421
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,293
Is this something that I did? That I...?

422
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,421
No. No, Dad. No.

423
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,507
This isn't your fault. Okay?

424
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,385
You've... You've always accepted me.

425
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,969
You've never judged me.

426
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,602
- But Mom...
- What?

427
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,063
What happened?

428
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,564
There was this one time.

429
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,235
We were back-to-school shopping.

430
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,865
And she made some off-hand comment.

431
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,412
Like... about needing to buy me...

432
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,499
husky clothes.

433
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,293
I don't know.

434
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:37,882
Man, I just felt, like, so ashamed.

435
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,096
So I...

436
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:50,395
I told her I was meeting Betty,
and I went to Fox Forest.

437
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,605
To be alone.

438
00:28:55,567 --> 00:29:00,155
I didn't even know it was a cruising spot.
And there was this other guy there.

439
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,074
And he was telling me I was cute.

440
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,284
Or whatever.

441
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,622
It was like...

442
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,794
all the stuff Mom said just washed away.

443
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:21,134
And ever since then, I...
I've been cruising.

444
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:27,432
It's like I'm hardwired this way.
Or something. I don't... I don't know.

445
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,808
I don't know.

446
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,332
Get out. Now.

447
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,213
You...

448
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,508
- You're not Patty.
- No, I'm her sister.

449
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,593
You can't do this.
You can't arrest me again.

450
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,846
- You let me go. You got nothing on me!
- You're right.

451
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,307
I'm not gonna arrest you.

452
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,100
But you are coming with me.

453
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,905
- Waldo. What's going on?
- Is Lerman with you?

454
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:28,243
What? No, definitely not.
I've been steering clear of him. Why?

455
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,079
His parents just called me.
They think Lerman ran away.

456
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,165
- Any idea where he might be?
- God, no. I haven't talked to him.

457
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,918
Tell the Logans
that I'm calling in some help.

458
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,548
Come on.

459
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,341
Please don't do this.

460
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,432
I told you,
I don't know where Patty is. Why?

461
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,059
Why are you doing this?

462
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:57,313
You really have to ask me that?

463
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,860
You are still preying on these girls.

464
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,196
Exactly the same way you preyed on Polly.

465
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,073
I have a family.

466
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,995
I had a sister.

467
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,334
No one looked out for those girls.

468
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,170
No one was protecting them.

469
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,131
I couldn't even protect Polly.

470
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,678
But I can deliver justice.

471
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,992
- Jughead.
- Hey. This is an emergency.

472
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,411
One of my students is missing
on the Lonely Highway.

473
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:57,749
I'm on the highway.
I'm ten miles north of town.

474
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,667
I'm leaving now. I'll meet you halfway.

475
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,878
- Who is it?
- Lerman Logan. He's 14.

476
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:05,881
I'm on my way.

477
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,853
I'll send someone to untie you tomorrow.

478
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,773
If I remember.

479
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,990
Here are the Stonewall Stallions

480
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:34,327
versus the Riverdale Bulldogs.

481
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,246
Let's go.

482
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,165
Go, go.

483
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,391
Lerman.

484
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,935
Thank God.

485
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:02,563
Yeah, he was walking
on the shoulder in a daze.

486
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,024
You okay, bud?

487
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,945
Mr. Jones.

488
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,615
Did it happen again?

489
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,416
Thank you for finding Lerman.

490
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,378
We'd hoped he wouldn't have
to go through this again.

491
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,296
- Again?
- Lerman's a sleepwalker.

492
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,757
Has been since he was little.

493
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,012
We thought he grew out of it,
but then he started hurting himself.

494
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,763
He walked into a door.

495
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,558
Another time
he burnt his hand on the stove.

496
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,060
Even fell out of a window once
and broke his arm.

497
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,813
We started locking
his bedroom door at night.

498
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,983
Now, we gave him
the whole basement to himself.

499
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,402
We just made sure he was safe.

500
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,779
So you were the mole people
keeping him locked up.

501
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,573
All we've done is try to protect him.

502
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,700
I remember we were so terrified

503
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,953
after that morning
we found the front door open and...

504
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,790
Lerman was just gone.

505
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,919
That whole week,
we thought we'd lost my boy.

506
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,213
Wait. He was missing for a week?

507
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,257
Where did he go? What happened?

508
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,885
A Good Samaritan found him
wandering the Lonely Highway.

509
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,222
With no memory of the prior week.

510
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,725
That's why we were so upset with you.

511
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:25,396
We thought your questioning might trigger
something like this happening.

512
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,233
God only knows
what draws him to that highway.

513
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,990
I don't think it's a coincidence.

514
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,453
Polly and Lerman both end up
on the Lonely Highway? No way.

515
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,705
I agree.
But what are the other connections?

516
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:46,542
When Polly escaped
and made that phone call, my mom said

517
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:50,463
she described being in what sounded like

518
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,549
- an alien spaceship.
- Seriously?

519
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,718
Could have been abducted
by the same person.

520
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,845
Why keep Polly but let Lerman go?

521
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,138
Maybe he escaped.

522
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,391
Which is why we need to find out
what Lerman knows.

523
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:06,312
We'll have to exhaust every option,
no matter how insane.

524
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,294
Yeah.

525
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,772
Bring it in. Come on. Circle up.

526
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,273
Circle up. Come on.

527
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,859
Look at me. Hey! Look at me.

528
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,654
Don't worry about the scoreboard.
I don't care what it says.

529
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,574
You're playing with heart.
That is all I could ever ask from you.

530
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,912
But listen. This is your moment.
The whole town is behind you.

531
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,373
The people in those stands
are here for you.

532
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,959
Your teammates are here for you.
I'm here for you!

533
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,169
We won't give up on each other.

534
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:39,423
If you don't give up on yourself,
then guess what? You can't lose.

535
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:43,469
If you don't give up on yourself,
you can't lose. Keep your head up.

536
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,472
Let's make this a night
we'll remember forever.

537
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,516
This game is not over. Bring it in.

538
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,977
- Britta, on you!
- Bulldogs, on three!

539
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,229
One, two, three, Bulldogs!

540
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,940
- Come on!
- Get out there and make something happen!

541
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,865
- Break!
- Let's go, Bulldogs!

542
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,452
Let's go, Bulldogs!

543
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,975
Down! Set! Hut!

544
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,066
Go, go, go!

545
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,443
Go, go, go, Britta!

546
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:08,304
Yes!

547
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,336
Archie!

548
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,383
- Heck of a game.
- What game were you watching?

549
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,968
The Bulldogs may not have
triumphed on the scoreboard,

550
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,847
but we've started to win over
the hearts and minds of the town.

551
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,266
Thanks to a side wager with my father,

552
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,978
the rest of the league will no longer
demand that we withdraw.

553
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,647
Ronnie for the win.

554
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,734
I just, uh...

555
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,654
I just wanted to say, "Good game."

556
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,156
Hey, thanks, Derek.
You played great out there.

557
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,408
What do you think?

558
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,077
- Kids got wheels, huh?
- He sure does.

559
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,413
Just remember, keep working.
Keep getting better.

560
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:18,082
I promise I will. Just like you taught me.

561
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,218
Waldo. This is becoming
a regular thing for us.

562
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,553
So it seems.

563
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,347
I just wanted to let you know

564
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,766
that Lerman's parents
have pulled him out of school.

565
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,644
- They've left Riverdale.
- Oh, my God.

566
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,147
- Where'd they go?
- They left me a message

567
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,150
but no forwarding address
or contact information.

568
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,694
Suppose they wanted a fresh start.

569
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,822
Yeah, don't we all?

570
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,749
- Hey. What's wrong?
- Agent Cooper.

571
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,799
- Glen, what's going on?
- I came to check on you.

572
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,594
Why is my mom upset?

573
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:15,055
Because you lied to me, Elizabeth.

574
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,392
You made me feel
like she might still be out there.

575
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,728
That there might still be hope.

576
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:25,566
You told your mother that the blood wasn't
a match for your sister's?

577
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,651
- Mom, I'm so sorry.
- No, don't.

578
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,321
How could you?

579
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,822
How dare you.

580
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,409
Can't imagine what you must be
going through, Mrs. Cooper.

581
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,829
I will be personally
taking over this case.

582
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:43,083
No, no, no. I'm working this case, Glen.
This is my sister!

583
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,795
I'll make sure that this investigation
is handled thoroughly. By the book.

584
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,173
I'll leave no stone unturned.
