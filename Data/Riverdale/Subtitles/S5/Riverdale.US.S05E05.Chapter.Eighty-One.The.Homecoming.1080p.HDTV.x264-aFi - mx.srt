1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,536
There's an old adage,
"You can't go home again,"

2
00:00:06,896 --> 00:00:09,804
which was certainly ringing
true for us.

3
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:14,746
Archie had been in a war,
Betty was an FBI agent,

4
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:19,230
Veronica was married,
Toni was Queen of the Serpents

5
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:21,312
and I was
a published writer.

6
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:23,575
So why were we
only talking about

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,132
how the town of
Riverdale had fallen

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,446
and Archie's pipe dream
to somehow save it?

9
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:31,551
Probably because
it was easier

10
00:00:31,635 --> 00:00:33,919
than the conversations
that awaited us.

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,517
Why didn't you
reach out?

12
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:44,185
I didn't think you wanted
me to after you left me that voicemail.

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,196
On the night of your
book launch?

14
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:50,192
After that,
I just assumed

15
00:00:50,277 --> 00:00:53,241
you didn't
want to hear from me.

16
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:56,770
That wasn't my intention.

17
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:58,534
I'm sorry if it came off
that way.

18
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:00,887
It was nice
to see you,

19
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:07,185
even if it's strange to be
back here, just deeply uncanny.

20
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:11,048
Same old Archie, though.
Trying to save everyone.

21
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:13,145
Good luck with that, dude.

22
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:16,553
I mean I have
a book to write.

23
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:18,487
Yeah, after Pop's
retirement party,

24
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:20,343
I have to get back to
Quantico.

25
00:01:21,077 --> 00:01:23,457
It's good to see you, too,
Jug,

26
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:26,849
even though it is
a bit weird.

27
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,492
That's some rock on
your finger, Ronnie.

28
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:38,153
- He must be a great guy.
- Chad?

29
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:39,853
Yeah, he is,

30
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:42,460
underneath
the bluster and bravado.

31
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:46,445
What about you, Bugle Boy?

32
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,793
I'm sure you've had a
swarm of lovers.

33
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:50,986
I don't know about that.

34
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:57,824
The last real relationship I was
in... was, well, it was with you.

35
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:04,072
Devil-may-care fling
never hurt anybody, Archie.

36
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:07,608
Besides, you should be
having fun at this point in your life.

37
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:10,140
Because
once you're married...

38
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:14,305
Well, that's why this is
just a quick jaunt for me.

39
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:17,777
I have to go back to my life,
my husband.

40
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,090
Yeah, for sure.

41
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:27,253
- Mom?
- Shh.

42
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:30,020
I brought you a vanilla
milkshake, extra thick.

43
00:02:30,105 --> 00:02:32,899
Oh, thanks, sweetheart.
Will you put in the fridge?

44
00:02:32,983 --> 00:02:35,235
Keep your voice down.
The twins are finally asleep.

45
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,611
Sure.

46
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:39,340
- Is Polly home yet?
- Nope. Not yet.

47
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:42,128
It's pretty late. Where is she?

48
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:45,804
Oh, you know, out and about
at work. You know your sister.

49
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:21,907
Jones, it's Samm.
Where the hell are you?

50
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:25,327
And where are your pages?
Scribners... Forsythe Jones,

51
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:29,164
you currently owe $9,876
to Premiere Credit.

52
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:32,697
If you do not pay the outstanding
balance within 24 hours...

53
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:41,832
So, how did the
Bughead reunion go?

54
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:44,471
As well as it could have,

55
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:46,973
considering not all of us
could be happily shacked up

56
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,892
with our
high school sweethearts, Kev.

57
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:51,686
Uh, FBI agent,
high school drama teacher.

58
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,727
I'm technically not an
agent yet.

59
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:00,695
-Oh, my God.
What? What is it?

60
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:04,905
Charles. He kept files of everyone
in my family, including me and...

61
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:08,486
tapes of our
phone conversations, I think.

62
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:14,126
Edgar, is it
really you?

63
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:16,296
No, bitch,
it's your sister.

64
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,133
- What?
- And you're as good as dead to me now too.

65
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,178
What the...

66
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:26,451
- Is that... - Me, calling Polly
on Halloween years ago.

67
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,123
Let's just get right
to it, Daddy.

68
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:34,042
I want back in on the
family businesses.

69
00:04:34,126 --> 00:04:36,022
I'm confused.
Don't you live in New York?

70
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:40,215
As it so happens, Chadwick and
I are looking for a weekend home,

71
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:41,983
possibly here in Riverdale.

72
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:43,802
I see.

73
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:48,055
Well, unfortunately for you, Hermosa
moved the rum business to Miami.

74
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,435
To
Toni Topaz years ago.

75
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,770
Without telling me?

76
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:55,605
It must have slipped my mind.

77
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:58,484
Like how you forgot to tell me
that you were marrying Chad.

78
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:01,861
By the way, if you're truly
interested in a weekend home,

79
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:04,113
might I suggest a property
in SoDale?

80
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:06,783
Oh, you mean Stepford
for bougie mobsters?

81
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,927
No, thanks. I'm good.

82
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:15,083
So you want me to give
you a job?

83
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,960
I just need some quick cash.

84
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:20,046
Kinda hoping you could hook me
up with something short-term.

85
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,923
You're lucky I'm even
willing to serve you, Jones.

86
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:25,385
What? Why? What
the hell is he doing here?

87
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:27,345
No way, Toni. No way.

88
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:31,138
Gathering some research for
your next book there, Jones?

89
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:36,354
Hang on. Are you guys
actually upset about my novel?

90
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:38,064
You made the Serpents look like
fools in it.

91
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:41,276
You mean the Vipers?
The Vipers were the good guys.

92
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,902
I didn't use your actual names.

93
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:45,280
You think people around here
couldn't figure out

94
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:48,700
who, what was that one
character's name, "Toothy" was?

95
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:50,285
Yeah, or Pop Eye?

96
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:52,871
You mocked our Serpent
traditions and codes,

97
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:55,164
and now you're asking for
our help?

98
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:58,293
Toni, guys.

99
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:01,129
Okay, I'll help.
I'll give you some advice.

100
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:03,214
Watch your back, Jones.

101
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:05,761
You've made a lot of enemies in
this town.

102
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,183
Principal Weatherbee,

103
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:16,978
as I wrote in my email, I'm here to
relaunch Riverdale High's RROTC program.

104
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:20,273
Archie, I meant to reply, but
it's been chaotic, to say the least.

105
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:21,612
What's up?

106
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:23,574
It's looking like
Riverdale High might not be

107
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:25,909
opening up its doors
next Monday.

108
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:29,037
Like everything else in this town, our
budget's been cut almost to nothing.

109
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:30,690
- Thanks to...
- Hiram Lodge.

110
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:33,297
Is there anything
I can do, sir?

111
00:06:33,463 --> 00:06:36,753
Alice, you're on the PTA. Any word on
which way the school board's leaning?

112
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:40,758
The board has some serious doubts.
I mean we're a skeleton crew here.

113
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:44,553
Kevin, you're teaching what,
five classes?

114
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:50,100
Drama, Debate, Biology, Gym and
Sex Ed.

115
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:51,643
So are we
dead in the water?

116
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:53,812
Not yet. There are some members
of the board

117
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,773
that would like to see
the school stay open

118
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:59,287
if we can prove that we have
the personnel and resources

119
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:01,528
that are required,
which is questionable.

120
00:07:01,612 --> 00:07:04,156
Well, the board will hear
arguments before the vote, right?

121
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,241
So we should all be there.

122
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,536
I'll speak, and in the meantime,
let's target the board members

123
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,538
who are still waffling and
work on them.

124
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:14,500
If we lose this vote,
we lose this school.

125
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,769
And that's another nail in
Riverdale's coffin.

126

It's Tabitha, right?
Tabitha Tate?

130
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:54,692
It is. And you're
Jughead Jones.

131
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:58,542
Yeah, I am. Hey, I noticed that
you're looking for a new waiter.

132
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,535
I'm definitely interested.

133
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:04,212
Thanks. But this definitely
isn't the right job for you.

134
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:05,429
You don't even know me.

135
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:07,358
Also, you can't just sit here
all day using my internet.

136
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:10,166
You have to actually
order food, not just coffee.

137
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:12,986
And then you have to pay for
said food.

138
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:16,346
My grandfather did things
his way, and I do them mine.

139
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:20,506
And the first rule of my diner
is no running tabs.

140
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:34,604
Toni Topaz.

141
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:36,797
You lost, old man?

142
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:40,177
It's okay, guys. I got this.

143
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,480
Look, you can save your breath.
If you're here to bribe me

144
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:47,543
or threaten me into giving up
the fight to save Riverdale High...

145
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:51,130
- How many students do you have?
- A hundred or so.

146
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:55,234
What if I offer them all a scholarship to
Stonewall? They'd be getting a world-class

147
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,653
education at zero cost.

148
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,406
Except for the fact that you're
on the board at Stonewall Prep,

149
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,325
which means on some level, the
school must reflect your morals,

150
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,953
which I'm not okay with.

151
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:11,208
What if I told you that there was an open
counselor position with a corner office

152
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:13,210
and a big, fat paycheck?

153
00:09:13,294 --> 00:09:15,004
Thanks, but no thanks.

154
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,131
So we're playing hardball, huh?

155
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:18,565
I guess so.

156
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,437
You know, it used to be Kevin
and I would sneak peeks

157
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:34,940
through that window,
hoping you were shirtless.

158
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:38,819
- And now you're spying on?
- Ghoulies.

159
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:41,322
They've turned the house into a
drug den.

160
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:44,967
Well, that tracks with everything
my mom says about this block.

161
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,595
I'm sorry, Arch.

162
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:50,164
It's only temporary.

163
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:52,708
Like Hiram Lodge trying to
close down Riverdale High.

164
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:57,254
I'm taking this town back, Betty,
building by building, if I have to.

165
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:58,898
Well, I can help.

166
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:02,843
I mean, I trained with the FBI.

167
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:08,741
I may just take you up on that, but
first, I need a little more information.

168
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,244
Where's the rest of
your team, Sheriff Keller?

169
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:13,452
You're looking at him.

170
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:15,898
Mayor Lodge cut my budget to
the bone.

171
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,525
I got no support staff and
no deputies.

172
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:21,112
And I'm covering the whole damn
county by myself.

173
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,407
Unless, of course, you count
Hiram's private security force.

174
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,860
They're connected to SoDale?

175
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:29,048
No, they work out of SoDale,
but they're corrupt as hell.

176
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:31,163
You should who's
running the force.

177
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:32,597
It's Reggie Mantle.

178
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:36,950
Well, maybe Reggie can help me
with my Ghoulie problem.

179
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:39,497
You call him,
he'll tip 'em off.

180
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,715
I mean, he's probably getting
some kind of a kickback from them.

181
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,801
You're not gonna get any help
from Reggie.

182
00:10:43,885 --> 00:10:48,013
Well, not knowingly, anyway.
You may not have any deputies left,

183
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:50,140
but you still have their
old gear, right?

184
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:53,977
Kevlar vests? Batons? Now you
might want to dust them off, Tom.

185
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:58,941
I'm gonna do some recon first,
but after that, we're going in.

186
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:06,490
I've been thinking a lot about your offer,
Trudy. Is that job still on the table?

187
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:08,624
<i>Hell yes, it is.
The Morris William Agency</i>

188
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,911
<i>would love to have you as a
sports agent.</i>

189
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:12,855
<i>But what about the
whole LA of it all?</i>

190
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,447
Well, I've been wanting to give
the West Coast a try for a while now.

191
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:18,919
Let me make some arrangements
and I'll get back to you.

192
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:21,338
- Okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

193
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:22,673
First class, of course.

194
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:25,300
<i>Yes, of course, Miss Lodge.</i>

195
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:30,222
<i>But I'm having a little trouble
with the credit card on file.</i>

196
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:31,541
Really?

197
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,153
That doesn't make sense.
Let me get back to you.

198
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,572
It's so weird, Chad.

199
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:40,159
I was doing some online
shopping, and

200
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:42,857
our American Excess card
was declined.

201
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:45,264
In fact, all of our
credit cards were declined.

202
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:46,810
Yeah, the same thing happened
to me.

203
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,870
But don't worry. I'll have it sorted
by the time you get back to New York.

204
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,236
Which is when, exactly?

205
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:56,619
The retirement party's in two
days, so probably the day after that.

206
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:59,155
Well, hurry.

207
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:02,921
- I miss you.
- I will. I miss you too.

208
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:04,400
Bye.

209
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:07,341
Miss Veronica.
Excuse me for interrupting.

210
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:09,303
No problem, Smithers.
What is it?

211
00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:11,972
I've noticed the same car
parked out front for two days now,

212
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:14,016
a black sedan with
tinted windows.

213
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,868
I fear you're being watched

214
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:17,493
followed.

215
00:12:17,895 --> 00:12:20,105
I wouldn't be surprised.

216
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:23,108
But is it a "Welcome back to
Riverdale" gift from my father

217
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:27,446
or a not-so-subtle message
from my overpossessive husband?

218
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:33,052
Either way, it's time to get creative
and bring an old friend out of mothballs.

219
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,457
How high are you willing
to jump for these?

220
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,376
Let's say twenty grand
for both.

221
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,232
I'll take thirty, but it has to
be in cash. Like, right now.

222
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,055
Also, you wouldn't by chance,

223
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,601
happen to have any
tasteful, discreet

224
00:12:57,685 --> 00:13:01,313
ladylike revolvers tucked
away somewhere, would you?

225
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:03,804
You know, this being
Riverdale and all.

226
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:05,564
I might have something.

227
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:56,401
Oh, my god, Polly!

228
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:57,612
You gave me a heart attack.

229
00:13:57,697 --> 00:13:59,242
You're the one
pointing a gun at me.

230
00:13:59,327 --> 00:14:00,356
Sorry.

231
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:02,031
Old habits.

232
00:14:02,115 --> 00:14:03,658
It's also 3:00 in the morning.

233
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,511
Well, you can go back to bed,
I'm not a burglar.

234
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:09,097
Hey, can I...

235
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:13,986
make you a cup of tea,
at least?

236
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,695
Polly, I want to apologize
to you.

237
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:30,257
I wasn't there for you on
the other side of the Farm

238
00:14:30,342 --> 00:14:32,444
when you needed me most.

239
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:37,525
Also for prank calling you
that year on Halloween,

240
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:41,171
I really didn't mean
what I said.

241
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:45,491
Well, it's a deep cut, Betty.

242
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:46,927
Yeah, I know.

243
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:49,596
I haven't forgotten.

244
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,975
If it's not too late, I'd like for us
to be real sisters to each other.

245
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:00,997
How long you in town for?

246
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:02,717
Just a couple days.

247
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,463
But once I finish at the
Academy, I'll be home a lot more.

248
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:08,166
I'm surprised you're not
already running the FBI.

249
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,926
I don't know about that.

250
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:15,281
I've missed you, Betty.

251
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:18,368
Mom, the twins...

252
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,734
we've all missed you.

253
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:37,835
Good morning.

254
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,629
Good morning, honey.
How'd you sleep?

255
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:42,673
Well, I woke up
when Polly got home.

256
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:45,301
Does she usually stay out
that late?

257
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:47,136
She's working
at that nightclub,

258
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,596
The Roving Eye.

259
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,948
She waitresses
a few nights a week.

260
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:54,393
Is that a good thing?

261
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:55,811
She helps with the mortgage,

262
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:57,772
gets the twins
everything they need.

263
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,565
She's doing her best.

264
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:00,983
- We all are.
- Oh, I know.

265
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:04,028
I just remember
the Roving Eye can be

266
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:06,697
- sketchy.
- Okay, that's not fair, Elizabeth.

267
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:08,574
You don't get to pop in,
take a look around

268
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:11,077
and judge your sister.
Or me, for that matter.

269
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,536
Ooh.

270
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,514
Can you get that?
It might be Toni.

271
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:17,708
Did you see
the morning paper, Alice?

272
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:21,629
"Local school counselor runs
seedy bar and snake dances."

273
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:22,849
It's a hit piece.

274
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:24,868
Hiram Lodge is trying
to ruin my credibility

275
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:26,124
in the eyes of
the school board.

276
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,468
Well, I'll run damage control.

277
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:29,512
I'll call each board member
if I have to.

278
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:31,192
Good. In the meantime,

279
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:34,141
if Hiram Lodge is trying to drag
the Serpent Queen down to his level,

280
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:36,035
he's gonna get himself bit.

281
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:48,739
- Archie, what's up?
- Jug.

282
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:51,551
How's the Five Seasons?
Room service every meal?

283
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:53,994
Morning, noon and night.

284
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:56,163
Look, I got an idea
for Pop Tate's retirement gift,

285
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:58,916
but I was wondering if maybe
one of us should say something.

286
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,584
You know, give a speech
about Pop Tate.

287
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:02,795
And since you're
the world famous writer...

288
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:03,921
Yeah.

289
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:05,131
Yeah, I'd love that.

290
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:07,400
Okay, great. Thanks, Jug.

291
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,812
Reggie,
it's good to see you, bro.

292
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:21,188
I appreciate you coming out.

293
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:22,773
Duty calls, Mantle answers.

294
00:17:22,857 --> 00:17:24,984
You having trouble
with your tenants, you said?

295
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:27,236
No, I'm having trouble
with the gang bangers

296
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,197
who are using my house
as a drug den, I said.

297
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:32,842
Well, let's see if there's
any merit to your claims.

298
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:41,165
It's messy, but I'm not
seeing any evidence

299
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:42,830
of drug paraphernalia.

300
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:44,986
Okay if we keep looking?

301
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:50,509
Nothing in here,
but stale cereal.

302
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:52,236
All right,
let's check upstairs.

303
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,703
I'm sorry, Andrews. I didn't
see any contraband anywhere.

304
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,952
Yeah.

305
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:05,150
You know, it's almost like
somebody tipped off the Ghoulies.

306
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:12,343
All right. Well, there's nothing
more for me to say or do.

307
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:15,189
But thanks
for your help, Reggie.

308
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:16,708
My pleasure, bro.

309
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:34,557
Feels strange to think
of not working at this place.

310
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,695
Well, on the bright side,
you won't have to deal

311
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,349
with annoying customers
like me anymore.

312
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:41,810
Now you know I had a lot worse
than you in here, Jughead.

313
00:18:41,894 --> 00:18:43,395
And it all worked out,
didn't it?

314
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:45,189
I lived to see my retirement.

315
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:47,191
And you, you're
a big-time writer now.

316
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:49,318
- Always knew you'd make a good...
- I'm sorry, Pop.

317
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:54,340
Uh, those are debt collectors.

318
00:18:58,697 --> 00:18:59,947
Hi there, gentlemen.

319
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:01,102
Counter or booth?

320
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:03,582
We're looking for someone.
Been known to hang around here.

321
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,893
Jughead Jones. Seen him?

322
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:16,011
No, I think I'd remember
a weird-ass name like that.

323
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,613
What do you want with him?

324
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,516
You just give us a call
if he comes in,

325
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,142
okay, sweetie?

326
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:25,329
Oh, I'll be sure
to do that, pumpkin.

327
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:27,039
Bye now.

328
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:36,115
Thank you.

329
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:38,659
It's not the greatest
first impression.

330
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:40,744
How much you need, Jug?
Maybe I can loan you some.

331
00:19:40,828 --> 00:19:42,788
I've been saving up...

332
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:45,040
I'm low, but I'm not low enough
to take your retirement money.

333
00:19:45,124 --> 00:19:46,959
I'll figure something out,
I always do.

334
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:49,040
Thanks for the interview.
See you tomorrow.

335
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,918
Hey, Jones.

336
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,480
If you still want it,
the waiter job's available.

337
00:19:55,088 --> 00:19:57,256
Okay.

338
00:19:57,341 --> 00:19:59,799
In a couple days,
could you just call them

339
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:01,618
and vouch for me
and say I have a job?

340
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:06,882
I'll send them half my weekly
salary so they don't break my legs.

341
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:11,030
Yeah, I think I can do that.

342
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:13,355
Long time
no see, Ronnie.

343
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:16,689
Reginald, I know you've been
working for my father,

344
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:18,740
- so let's skip the pleasantries.
- Fair enough.

345
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:20,128
I need to buy a car.

346
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:21,859
Nothing flashy,
just in good shape

347
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:23,233
and with excellent gas mileage.

348
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:24,443
I'm paying cash.

349
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:26,180
Who you runnin' from?

350
00:20:26,265 --> 00:20:27,641
Your husband?

351
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,209
Is that how you roll now?

352
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:31,462
I'm not running
from anyone, Reggie.

353
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,172
I'm taking the path
of least resistance,

354
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:35,016
and I'd rather not leave
a paper trail.

355
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:38,124
Now, will you sell me
a car or not?

356
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,033
If you're in trouble,
talk to your dad.

357
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:41,908
Like really, talk to him.

358
00:20:41,993 --> 00:20:43,953
'Cause he'll help you.
Even now, still,

359
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:45,556
with whatever you need.

360
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,765
You're sure you saw Polly?

361
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,475
No doubt about it.

362
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,435
So she's hanging with
the Ghoulies, probably using.

363
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,272
Seems like that's a safe bet.

364
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:07,833
- I'm sorry, Betty.
- I'm not sorry.

365
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,818
I'm pissed.

366
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:13,380
So my question is,
when do we kick their asses?

367
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,143
All right, thanks
to Reggie Mantle,

368
00:21:16,228 --> 00:21:18,252
I have enough intel
to sweep and clear the site.

369
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:20,020
How many Ghoulies
are in your house?

370
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,872
I counted a dozen
in these zones.

371
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:23,665
We hit 'em hard,

372
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,276
- we hit 'em fast.
- Nice.

373
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:27,221
It's been too long since the
Serpents rumbled with the Ghoulies.

374
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:28,420
Calm down, Sweet Pea.

375
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,172
I don't want
anyone dying today,

376
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,590
especially not my boyfriend.

377
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:33,133
Hopefully, they've
dropped their guard

378
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:34,551
and we can find
some narcotics in the house.

379
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:36,928
And like Kev said,
no one gets killed.

380
00:21:37,012 --> 00:21:38,513
None of us and none of them.

381
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,973
Wouldn't mind breaking
a few bones, though.

382
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:41,224
Hell, yeah.

383
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:45,645
♪ Don't you ever feel sad ♪

384
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:46,771
♪ Lean on me... ♪

385
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:50,959
Okay. Three, two, one. Go.

386
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:52,861
What the hell?

387
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,379
Get 'em.

388
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,420
You good?

389
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:21,137
- Yeah, you?
- Yeah.

390
00:22:28,252 --> 00:22:29,336
Jingle Jangle.

391
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,043
Just like the old days.

392
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:33,109
They've got a lab set up
in the bathroom.

393
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:35,986
Will that be enough to put
'em behind bars, Agent Cooper?

394
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:38,585
Yeah, Kev, that should do it.

395
00:22:43,054 --> 00:22:44,472
The Roving Eye.

396
00:22:44,556 --> 00:22:45,983
Hi, this is Polly.

397
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:48,184
I'm just calling to get
my schedule for the week.

398
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:49,574
Polly Cooper?

399
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:51,909
You haven't worked at the
Roving Eye for over a year.

400
00:22:52,235 --> 00:22:53,753
Who is this?

401
00:22:56,647 --> 00:22:57,931
Bad news.

402
00:22:58,016 --> 00:23:00,153
Two more teachers have
defected to Stonewall Prep,

403
00:23:00,238 --> 00:23:01,682
Ms. Crouton and Mr. Cedars.

404
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:03,073
Damn it, Ms. Crouton!

405
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:05,951
-That backstabbing...
We've got a bigger problem.

406
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:08,079
I had one of my girls
break into my Hiram's office

407
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:09,914
to see what dirt
we could use against him,

408
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:12,166
and she found his secret agenda
for the town hall meeting.

409
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,460
I love that it feels like we're
in an episode right now.

410
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:16,712
And besides deciding
about Riverdale High,

411
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:19,882
Hiram is also putting forth a
vote to unincorporate the town.

412
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,677
Based on the receipts, seems as
though he has enough people bribed

413
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:24,387
or terrorized
into passing the motion.

414
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,347
Wait, unincorporate the town,
what does that even mean?

415
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:28,224
It means that all the money

416
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:30,559
that the town gets from
the state for public services,

417
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,270
for maintenance,
for education, it goes away.

418
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:35,731
It means that Riverdale
as a town, ceases to exist.

419
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:38,818
So Hiram Lodge will finally
get what he's wanted for years...

420
00:23:38,902 --> 00:23:41,529
- The death of Riverdale.
- So his precious SoDale can thrive.

421
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:43,489
But if that happens,
would we even be able

422
00:23:43,573 --> 00:23:45,533
to keep the school open
with the board's support?

423
00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:46,992
Technically, yes.

424
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:48,202
But it's going to make it
much, much harder.

425
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:49,704
So we need to fight harder.

426
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:51,622
Alice, I'm going to need you
to go on RIVW

427
00:23:51,706 --> 00:23:53,207
and blow the whistle
on Hiram's plan.

428
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,667
He was trying to keep it secret

429
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:56,877
so no one would show up
and oppose him,

430
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:59,714
but we need the public there so
they could vote against Hiram's plan.

431
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:01,340
Okay, but what about
our teacher problem?

432
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:03,217
I think I can maybe help
with that.

433
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:06,679
Oh, do you know any
qualified teachers with degrees?

434
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:08,806
Because that's what it takes
to be a public school teacher.

435
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,141
What if Riverdale went private?

436
00:24:10,225 --> 00:24:11,559
That way we could choose
who we wanted.

437
00:24:11,643 --> 00:24:13,436
Yes, but we'd lose
all public funding.

438
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,645
Well, if the town
unincorporates,

439
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:15,747
we lose funding anyways.

440
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:17,558
We need an investor.

441
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:20,241
I think I might know someone.

442
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:25,349
Archie, if you have any
favors to call in, now is the time.

443
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,618
Reggie suggested
I come see you again.

444
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,580
I've been running around town
trying to vamp my way out of a problem,

445
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:35,541
when really I should be
facing it head-on.

446
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:38,811
With, maybe, your help.

447
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,430
Go on.

448
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:47,263
Chad is threatened
by my "alpha-ness."

449
00:24:47,428 --> 00:24:51,557
Because of that, he can be
somewhat possessive and controlling.

450
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:53,100
He was having me followed,

451
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:56,437
but I just shot out
his goon's tires. So...

452
00:24:56,521 --> 00:24:58,439
Ah, young love.

453
00:24:58,523 --> 00:25:00,024
I remember those days.

454
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:02,093
I knew you'd relate.

455
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:05,671
Which is why I'd appreciate
you having a little chat with him,

456
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,823
as only you can, Daddykins.

457
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:09,283
Nothing too draconian,

458
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:12,620
just tell him to stop trying
to manage me

459
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,330
or track me when I leave town.

460
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:15,790
Why don't you
tell him yourself?

461
00:25:15,874 --> 00:25:17,500
He's not taking my hints.

462
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:21,504
But I'm betting the Hiram Lodge

463
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:23,775
could be a lot more persuasive.

464
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:26,359
And then you
don't get your

465
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:29,112
little Barnard-educated
hands dirty, is that right?

466
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:32,473
Hmm.

467
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:34,391
So,

468
00:25:34,475 --> 00:25:37,106
just to be clear, you're
officially asking me for my help?

469
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:39,877
Sure.

470
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:42,739
Yes, I am.

471
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,669
Well, in that case...

472
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:47,505
No.

473
00:25:48,706 --> 00:25:50,265
Come again?

474
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:53,712
Remember you called me a dog

475
00:25:53,995 --> 00:25:56,169
and you told me that
I needed to be taught a lesson?

476
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:57,497
It's about seven years ago.

477
00:25:57,582 --> 00:25:59,767
You were cruel, Veronica.

478
00:26:00,251 --> 00:26:01,794
Brutal,

479
00:26:01,878 --> 00:26:03,587
when my body
was just a mass of bruises.

480
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:06,131
Well, now it's my turn
to teach you a lesson.

481
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:08,592
I warned you from the start

482
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:10,803
that no one
outside of this family

483
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:13,889
would understand
the Lodge ambition.

484
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,558
You made your bed.

485
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:17,852
You're gonna have to deal
with Chad yourself.

486
00:26:17,936 --> 00:26:21,286
And if that means you have to to
crawl into the mud to do it, then so be it.

487
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:23,732
You're a Lodge, after all.

488
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,527
You never had any intention
of helping me, did you?

489
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:28,362
You just wanted to hear me beg.

490
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:31,549
Hmm. I assume you don't
need my help finding the exit?

491
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:44,003
But Polly, it's not every day
that Pop Tate retires.

492
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:46,213
- We can bring the twins.
- I told you I have to work.

493
00:26:46,297 --> 00:26:47,590
Can't you take the night off?

494
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:49,300
Oh, my god. Mom,
I said get off my back!

495
00:26:49,384 --> 00:26:51,969
Polly, give Mom a break.

496
00:26:52,053 --> 00:26:54,363
It's fine. Polly has to work.

497
00:26:56,973 --> 00:26:59,534
Actually, I'm not so sure
she does, Mom.

498
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:03,122
I know you don't
waitress at the Roving Eye

499
00:27:03,272 --> 00:27:05,107
and that you've been
hanging out with the Ghoulies.

500
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:06,609
Elizabeth, stop it!

501
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:08,284
So how exactly are you
making all of this money

502
00:27:08,368 --> 00:27:10,829
to help out with the mortgage
and support the twins?

503
00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:13,143
Are you dealing? Tricking?

504
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:14,646
- Both?
- It's none of your business.

505
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,336
Actually, it is
because I care about you...

506
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:18,964
You don't live here.

507
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:20,953
You deserted us, okay?

508
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:23,164
Being a real sister doesn't
mean coming in for one day

509
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:24,834
and telling me how
to live my life,

510
00:27:24,992 --> 00:27:26,982
especially when you
don't know anything about it.

511
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,628
Wait, Polly.

512
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:49,435
- Samm, how are ya?
- At the end of my rope.

513
00:27:49,523 --> 00:27:52,168
Scribners wants pages,
or their money back.

514
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,542
Yeah, I know, I know.

515
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:54,837
-I'm working on something else.
What?

516
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:56,255
What have you been working on?

517
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:58,118
Actually...

518
00:27:58,419 --> 00:27:59,967
Let me send it to you.
Let me know what you think.

519
00:28:00,051 --> 00:28:01,481
Might be enough
to convince Scribners

520
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:02,594
that I'm not a one hit wonder.

521
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:05,030
Okay, I'm e-mailing you...

522
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:08,534
...right now.

523
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:19,909
I'm grateful
for your help, Betty.

524
00:28:20,905 --> 00:28:22,905
Believe me, I'd rather be
dealing with this mess

525
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,679
than the one I made
at my own house.

526
00:28:25,056 --> 00:28:27,056
I'm sorry to hear about that.

527
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,880
No!

528
00:28:37,836 --> 00:28:40,463
I'm grateful
for your help, Betty.

529
00:28:40,548 --> 00:28:42,881
Believe me, I'd rather be
dealing with this mess

530
00:28:42,966 --> 00:28:44,760
than the one I made
at my own house.

531
00:28:44,844 --> 00:28:46,487
I'm sorry to hear about that.

532
00:28:49,223 --> 00:28:50,557
It's okay.

533
00:28:50,744 --> 00:28:52,721
I'll be okay, I hope.

534
00:28:56,395 --> 00:28:58,575
Hey, after Pop's party,
I thought you and me,

535
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,359
Jughead and Veronica
could hang out,

536
00:29:00,443 --> 00:29:01,819
just the four of us.

537
00:29:01,903 --> 00:29:03,028
We haven't done that yet.

538
00:29:03,112 --> 00:29:05,489
No, yeah, that's a nice idea.

539
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:07,002
Let's do that.

540
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,260
Cool.

541
00:29:15,235 --> 00:29:17,070
Hey, do you want some pizza?

542
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,294
It's the least I can do
to thank you for everything.

543
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:20,546
Yeah.

544
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,857
Pizza. Yeah, that sounds great.

545
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:27,469
I'm gonna take a shower first.

546
00:29:27,553 --> 00:29:28,904
Oh, I sh...

547
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:31,098
I... me too.

548
00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:33,492
- Do you wanna go first?
- Should I go home first?

549
00:29:50,451 --> 00:29:52,803
♪ Say my name now ♪

550
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:56,765
♪ Don't make me wait now ♪

551
00:29:58,626 --> 00:30:02,921

553
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,437
Betty, what just happened?

554
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:19,274
I don't know.

555
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:21,485
Something we've been wanting
to do since high school,

556
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,320
but never got around to.

557
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,948
Yeah,
sounds about right.

558
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,243
- Just to be clear, we're...
- Friends.

559
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,453
Just good old friends.

560
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:33,080
We're both single adults.

561
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,554
We're allowed to have fun
every now and then, right?

562
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,709
Yeah.

563
00:30:37,793 --> 00:30:39,853
And it's okay
if we keep this to ourselves.

564
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:43,006
Yeah. Veronica's
a married woman,

565
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,027
and Jughead and I haven't dated
for seven years, so...

566
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:50,264
I think it's okay.

567
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,865
Okay, good.

568
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,688
What a gift!

569
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,939
Thank you, Archie.

570
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,691
Oh, it's from all of us, Pop.

571
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,943
It's a small token to show
how much you mean to us,

572
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,258
to Riverdale High,
to the whole town.

573
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:06,405
Yeah!

574
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,991
You know, I had to
drop out of school

575
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,452
to take over running
this place after my Pop,

576
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:15,706
the original Pop, passed away.

577
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,516
I never got to graduate.

578
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,877
This means the world to me.

579
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,190
Jug's gonna say a few words.

580
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,593
I think sometimes it can be
hard to put our faith in this town.

581
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:39,605
But I think Pop created
something really special here,

582
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,898
created a place for
the lost and wayward souls

583
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:43,625
of Riverdale to come to.

584
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,778
And I think, that's more than

585
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:48,614
jukebox or vinyl booths.

586
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,925
It's... like a lighthouse
in the storm.

587
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,054
And Pop himself,

588
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,222
he's many things.

589
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,917
He's a joker.

590
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:03,545
He's a soldier.

591
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:05,714
He's a cook.

592
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,628
He's
a really good listener.

593
00:32:08,884 --> 00:32:10,761
He's also a father.

594
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,489
He's a son, and a grandfather.

595
00:32:14,473 --> 00:32:15,908
And to many of us

596
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:19,078
and to me personally...

597
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:25,442
it's about the only reason
that I made it through.

598
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:28,504
You gave us a home, Pop.

599
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:33,509
Thank you.

600
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,803
To Pop Tate

601
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,164
who never let
the lights go dark.

602
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,874
Pop Tate!

603
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,925
Cheryl, I'm glad you came.

604
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,843
I wasn't sure you would,
after I

605
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:53,053
sent you my message.

606
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,305
It sounded rather dire,

607
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:57,474
plus, Pop always added
the drop of human kindness

608
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,809
to whatever my order was.

609
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,644
Have you considered my ask

610
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:04,648
to fund Riverdale
and the new teachers it needs?

611
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,692
It's the only thing that might,

612
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,027
might... save the school.

613
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:11,071
Look, I came here
to celebrate Pop,

614
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,966
not get caught up in small
town politics, Antoinette.

615
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,201
And I can barely afford

616
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,453
Thornhill's renovations
as it is.

617
00:33:18,537 --> 00:33:20,789
Cheryl, I know you think
you're cursed,

618
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,708
and the sins of your family
are so great,

619
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,960
there's nothing you can do
to atone for them.

620
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,920
But you're wrong.

621
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:29,857
There's a war going on
in Riverdale for Riverdale.

622
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,816
We need you.

623
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,345
I'm sorry. I can't.

624
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:37,013
It will start as
something good,

625
00:33:37,097 --> 00:33:40,075
and end up corrupted,
like everything I try to do.

626
00:33:41,977 --> 00:33:44,121
If you won't do it
for the town...

627
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,748
would you do it for me?

628
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,250
Please?

629
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:53,380
If our love ever meant
anything to you,

630
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,882
help us.

631
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:01,788
If I gave you the money,

632
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:03,662
who would these
new teachers even be?

633
00:34:07,753 --> 00:34:09,296
So you're really gonna
do this, huh?

634
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,089
Well...

635
00:34:11,173 --> 00:34:14,050
Run the RROTC
out of your old high school?

636
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:15,819
If I get a chance to, yeah.

637
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,889
It's kinda why I wanted us
to sneak in here,

638
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,323
the four of us.

639
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,227
Hiram's trying to
shut this place down.

640
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:26,202
And he's pushing to
unincorporate the town,

641
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:27,712
which would wipe Riverdale
off the map.

642
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:29,941
My father is nothing,
if not consistent.

643
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:31,777
Oh, I think we can stop him,

644
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,046
- or at least slow him down.
- How?

645
00:34:36,615 --> 00:34:38,241
We become teachers here.

646
00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:39,534
Mm...

647
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:41,077
I know it sounds crazy,

648
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:42,621
but it's also a way to
keep the school going,

649
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,956
which means
if Hiram wins the vote,

650
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,001
we still have a defendable
position, this school.

651
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:51,379
And if we can save it,
we can give people at least

652
00:34:51,463 --> 00:34:53,840
one more reason
to stay in Riverdale.

653
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:55,217
And in time,

654
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,635
we can bring this town
back to life.

655
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,069
Archie...

656
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,346
I'm married.

657
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,680
I have a life back in New York.

658
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:03,266
Yeah, and I have
a novel to write.

659
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,811
Veronica, plenty of people
commute to the city.

660
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,313
And Jug, you always said,

661
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:11,083
you do your best writing
in a booth at Pop's.

662
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:13,860
And it's not gonna be long...

663
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:15,439
a month or two,

664
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:16,905
just to give Weatherbee
enough time

665
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,782
to find permanent replacements.

666
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,216
I'm in.

667
00:35:21,272 --> 00:35:22,939
Quantico can wait
a couple months,

668
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:25,817
and I need to be here right now
for my mom and Polly.

669
00:35:25,901 --> 00:35:27,251
Thanks, Betty.

670
00:35:28,654 --> 00:35:30,004
Jug?

671
00:35:31,073 --> 00:35:32,863
I'd have to clear it
with my new job.

672
00:35:33,492 --> 00:35:35,077
But why not?

673
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:38,288
I'd like to shape some
impressionable young minds.

674
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:39,414
I'm in, too.

675
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:41,124
I'll make it work with Chad.

676
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,793
And considering that
what's happening here

677
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:44,753
is all my dad's fault...

678
00:35:44,837 --> 00:35:47,214
I need to give back
more than anyone.

679
00:35:47,298 --> 00:35:49,633
And I didn't really wanna be
a sports agent anyway.

680
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:51,551
That's awesome, Veronica.

681
00:35:51,635 --> 00:35:54,680
So... Bulldogs forever?

682
00:36:00,186 --> 00:36:02,104
Bulldogs forever!

683
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:05,065
Before
the school board votes

684
00:36:05,149 --> 00:36:06,858
on the fate of Riverdale High,

685
00:36:06,942 --> 00:36:10,112
Toni Topaz has asked
to say a few words.

686
00:36:10,196 --> 00:36:11,279
Good afternoon!

687
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:13,323
My name is Toni Topaz,

688
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:16,910
and I am a guidance counselor
at Riverdale High.

689
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:21,039
The point of a school board
is to make sure there's equity,

690
00:36:21,123 --> 00:36:24,710
that kids of all ages,
from all different backgrounds

691
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:28,004
have equal access to education.

692
00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:33,548
Well, with the help of one
very generous donor,

693
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:35,996
I'm happy to announce
that Riverdale High

694
00:36:36,081 --> 00:36:39,055
will be able to do that
as a private school.

695
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:43,320
And unlike other
private schools,

696
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:45,940
Riverdale will be tuition-free.

697
00:36:46,146 --> 00:36:48,684
And we're bolstering
our teaching staff

698
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:52,678
with notable alumnus
like Sergeant Archie Andrews,

699
00:36:52,903 --> 00:36:57,659
FBI trainee and Yale graduate,
Betty Cooper,

700
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:01,452
businesswoman and Barnard grad,
Veronica Gekko

701
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:06,249
and acclaimed author,
Forsythe Jones III.

702
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:08,293
So spread the news
far and wide,

703
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:09,863
that Riverdale
and its children,

704
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:12,046
will not be at the mercy

705
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,883
of Hiram Lodge's
destructive whims.

706
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:16,968
Thank you.

707
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:19,952
That's very nice.

708
00:37:23,058 --> 00:37:24,934
That was better than
Kendall Roy's speech

709
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:26,060
at the end of season two.

710
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,895
And now, I'd like to introduce

711
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,898
what I hope will be
my last motion as Mayor,

712
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:34,878
a proposition to unincorporate
the town of Riverdale.

713
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:38,465
All those opposed?

714
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:41,384
All those in favor?

715
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:46,956
Majority wins.

716
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,726
The township of Riverdale
is hereby dissolved.

717
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:59,623
What had taken
decades to build

718
00:37:59,707 --> 00:38:01,834
was toppled in
the blink of an eye.

719
00:38:01,918 --> 00:38:05,087
With the rap of a gavel,
Riverdale was no more.

720
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:07,548
And yet, life continues.

721
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:15,222
Samm, I was gonna call you.

722
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:16,974
Jones, Scribners loved
your story

723
00:38:17,058 --> 00:38:18,408
about the old man.

724
00:38:19,352 --> 00:38:20,853
- They what?
- Yeah.

725
00:38:20,937 --> 00:38:22,477
They think it's your next book
and a slam dunk.

726
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,177
Apparently, there's,
there's a huge market right now

727
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,691
for tragic Americana,

728
00:38:25,775 --> 00:38:27,317
dying community,

729
00:38:27,401 --> 00:38:29,528
all of the miserable people
who live there,

730
00:38:29,612 --> 00:38:31,783
you know, we'll call it
Elegy for a Small Town.

731
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:33,218
What do you think?

732
00:38:33,366 --> 00:38:34,742
Ah...

733
00:38:34,826 --> 00:38:37,369
No, I don't wanna
write about that.

734
00:38:37,453 --> 00:38:39,288
You don't have a choice, Jones.
This is your ticket

735
00:38:39,372 --> 00:38:41,582
under the literary grave
you dug for yourself.

736
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:44,418
Now you need to deliver.
Understood?

737
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:46,687
- Yeah, understood.
- Thank you.

738
00:39:02,645 --> 00:39:04,605
Hey, Mom. I checked upstairs.

739
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:06,713
The twins are playing,
but Polly's still not home.

740
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:08,125
I'm worried.

741
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,569
You know your sister.
She gets angry, storms off.

742
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:12,029
God knows when she'll be back.

743
00:39:12,113 --> 00:39:13,864
This is what happens.

744
00:39:13,948 --> 00:39:15,758
But this one's
on you, Elizabeth.

745
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:21,288
I'm not
coming home just yet.

746
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:24,124
I'm gonna stay in Riverdale
a little bit longer, Chad.

747
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,585
Oh... why is that?

748
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:30,088
My alma mater, Riverdale High,
has fallen on hard times

749
00:39:30,172 --> 00:39:31,632
and needs my help.

750
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:33,342
So, I'll be teaching there.

751
00:39:33,426 --> 00:39:35,010
That's absurd.

752
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:38,847
No, no. What's absurd is
you freezing our credit cards,

753
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:41,308
especially since I made
most of the money

754
00:39:41,392 --> 00:39:42,976
that's in our joint accounts.

755
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,235
Yeah.

756
00:39:44,386 --> 00:39:49,050
So, if they're not unfrozen
in the next, say, 30 minutes,

757
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:51,457
I'll consider it
an act of aggression.

758
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:53,417
You know, like you
having me followed.

759
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:55,002
And the next time you see me,

760
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:57,463
it'll be on Wall Street,
on the floor,

761
00:39:57,547 --> 00:39:59,173
when the markets open
Monday morning.

762
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,868
And this she wolf
will tear out your throat

763
00:40:01,953 --> 00:40:03,385
in front of
all the other alpha dogs,

764
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:04,970
with zero hesitation.

765
00:40:05,054 --> 00:40:06,972
Is that it, then?

766
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:08,599
- Are we done?
- You have 30 minutes

767
00:40:08,793 --> 00:40:10,186
to reactivate our cards.

768
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,033
- Jug.
- Hey... Sorry, it's late.

769
00:40:51,768 --> 00:40:53,477
Wondering if you could, uh...

770
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:54,770
use a roommate, now that you're

771
00:40:54,854 --> 00:40:56,647
in this big, empty house
all by yourself.

772
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:59,066
Yeah, what happened to
the Five Seasons?

773
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,069
It's a little rich
for my blood.

774
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:03,503
Come in.

775
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:15,099
<i>Hey, it's Polly.
Leave a message.</i>

776
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,694
Polly, it's me again.

777
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:21,461
I wanted to say that I'm sorry
about what I said before.

778
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:24,291
I really had no right
to judge you,

779
00:41:24,376 --> 00:41:26,760
especially after being gone
for so long.

780
00:41:26,844 --> 00:41:27,845
It wasn't my place.

781
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:30,323
So, I wanna tell you that

782
00:41:30,408 --> 00:41:32,602
I love you,
and that I'm here for you.

783
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:33,976
So just call me.

784
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,311
And I'll come find you,
wherever you are

785
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:38,313
or I'll see you
when you get home.

786
00:41:38,397 --> 00:41:40,999
Just please, please, please,
come home.

787
