1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,551
Previously on Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,679
If we divorce,
I can testify against you in court.

3
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:15,181
No one would believe
that the She-Wolf of Wall Street

4
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,226
didn't know about the dirty dealings
going on in her own business.

5
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,562
Archie, I'm staying in New York.

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,980
Ronnie, don't do this.

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,607
I'm not going to stop looking for Polly.

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,234
I will get justice, Mom.

9
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:30,238
I have a favor to ask. I have
some personal trauma I can't access.

10
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,866
I need someone I trust to watch over me.

11
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,785
You have to get some writing done.
I'll be back in the morning.

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,871
- Write.
- Tabitha. Tabitha, don't!

13
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,832
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,001
Uncle Frank, Kev's dad said
there was a prison break.

15
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,169
Boom.

16
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,922
Some inmates said they were paid
to trash the town, especially this school.

17
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,550
Only Hiram Lodge would be
crazy enough to do that.

18
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,388
Hiram's escapees
trashed everything.

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,766
Pulled wires from walls,
smashed circuit breakers,

20
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,893
even broke sinks and toilets.

21
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,104
How long until we can get
this place back in shape, Mr. Andrews?

22
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,023
At least three weeks.

23
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:09,110
- And that's if I can pull a crew together.
- Count me in, Archie.

24
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,447
Let's get started.
I guess it's back to remote learning.

25
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,204
Ms. Veronica. Welcome back.

26
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,413
Smithers.

27
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,417
Oh! Is that my special delivery?

28
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,419
Oh, ah, yes. It came last night.

29
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,339
Uh, there's something
you should know. Your fath...

30
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,508
Let me get eyes on the opal first.

31
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,478
Oh, Smithers.

32
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,147
My gem contact in Ethiopia did not lie.

33
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,400
This blue opal is even more stunning
than I imagined.

34
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,194
And just in time too.

35
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,447
I've got a buyer coming in
from Montreal, Mr. Sand.

36
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:59,369
I can use the commission from the sale
to start paying back Chad's investors.

37
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:04,332
Something happened while you were gone.
Your father's prison was compromised.

38
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,250
What?

39
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,586
The town was flooded
with convicts wreaking havoc and mayhem.

40
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,549
- Hit hardest was Riverdale High.
- Oh, my God.

41
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,220
Archie. Thank God.

42
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,139
I heard about the prison break.

43
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,225
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

44
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,061
School's a mess,
but it could have been a lot worse.

45
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,647
How did things go with Chad?
Did he sign the divorce papers?

46
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,150
Uh, not exactly.

47
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,901
Chad threw me a curveball.

48
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:37,407
I could explain, but for legal reasons,
it's better you don't know the details.

49
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,700
I know. I'm sorry.

50
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,619
I really hate
that I'm dragging you through this.

51
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,457
I appreciate it, but until you
and Chad are officially done...

52
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,003
I think we should keep our distance.

53
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,299
We can be friends, but that's it.
Not until those papers are signed.

54
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,301
I...

55
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,179
suppose that makes sense.

56
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,431
I'm gonna be busy anyway.

57
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,976
I told Tom I'd help him round up any
convicts who are still causing trouble.

58
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,188
Well, only when I feel like it.

59
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,190
Well, you are legally senile.

60
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,443
Good morning, sisters.

61
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,403
What are you so happy about?

62
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,489
Life, Cheryl. Everlasting life.

63
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,453
Whilst in prison,
I started my own ministry.

64
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,956
And now that I am free, I can see plainly

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,875
that continuing my good work

66
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,920
is precisely
what this wicked little town needs.

67
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,672
We'll hold two services a day,

68
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,758
right here on the estate.

69
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,301
A ministry.

70
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:42,347
Shouldn't you be hiding in the walls,
perchance the po-po come a-knocking?

71
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,430
Actually...

72
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,435
due to my active spiritual work,

73
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,312
I was up for early parole.

74
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,648
What we need is money,

75
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,610
not some sham religion created by
and for convicts.

76
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,863
God is on our side, child.

77
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,076
When we start this church,
he will provide.

78
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,936
- Hello?
- Is this Betty?

79
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,771
Yeah, who is this?

80
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,357
It's Tabitha. Tabitha Tate.

81
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,316
Hi.

82
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,529
I know this is out of the blue,
but I can't find Jughead anywhere.

83
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,781
I was supposed to watch him, long story.

84
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,325
Now he's missing. I'm worried about him.

85
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,329
Look, Jughead's been known
to go off-grid for days at a time.

86
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:55,253
I can stop by Pop's tomorrow
and check in with you if you want.

87
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,754
I appreciate that.

88
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,172
- Thank you, Betty.
- Yeah.

89
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,343
Give me the cash in your register! Now!

90
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,512
No problem.
Please, just don't hurt anyone.

91
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,097
Give me the money!

92
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,773
Jeremiah Peterson,

93
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,944
serving five to ten years
for two counts of armed robbery.

94
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:25,366
There's about to be three unless
you can help us find your fellow escapees.

95
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,744
Most of them are long gone.

96
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,371
Hightailed it out of Riverdale
after the prison break.

97
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,707
- A few stayed behind.
- How many?

98
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,500
I want a lawyer.

99
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,002
And some more meds.

100
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,257
Maybe after he's had some rest

101
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,342
and some painkillers,
he'll wanna talk to us.

102
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,553
I'll look in on him periodically.

103
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,637
Night.

104
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,681
Isn't it beautiful?

105
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,850
I was tracking this opal down for months.

106
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,727
It finally came in.

107
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,687
It's sublime.

108
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,568
Well, isn't this a small world?

109
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,861
Wait.

110
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,658
You're those psychos
from Thanksgiving seven years ago.

111
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,535
Don't even think about it, darling.

112
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,288
Hands up. Both of you.

113
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,583
Dodger, smash and grab.

114
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,007
We'll take that too.

115
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,682
Hope your insurance is all paid up.

116
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,606
What the hell just happened?

117
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,989
Hey. You should see this.

118
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,367
...to round up the majority
of these criminals.

119
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,037
We believe there's a small group
of escapees still at large

120
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,498
in the town formerly known as Riverdale.

121
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,251
Local philanthropist Hiram Lodge and I

122
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,337
are offering a reward for any information

123
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,550
that may lead to a safe capture
of any and all prisoners.

124
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,302
Wait. So Hiram sets free a bunch of cons.

125
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,347
Now he's offering a reward
for bringing them back?

126
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,016
A PR stunt to paint themselves as heroes.

127
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,728
Where are you going?

128
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,148
We need money to fix this school.
They're offering it.

129
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,650
I'm rounding up criminals and cashing in.

130
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,278
If it isn't my old friend...

131
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,363
- Hello, Archie.
- Hiram.

132
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,990
Governor Dooley.

133
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,201
I saw the press conference.
I'm going after your prisoners.

134
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,538
Do you have a list
of the missing convicts?

135
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,543
Here is some of the names
of the inmates confirmed to be at large.

136
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,421
Thank you.

137
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,092
You'll hear from me.
And keep your checkbook handy.

138
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,558
This is a mess. Blowing up the prison
was never a part of our greater plan.

139
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,060
- As far as you know.
- Cut the crap!

140
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,813
Just give me my cut of the palladium.

141
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,486
I've told you over and over again,
governor,

142
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,322
we didn't find any
beneath the prison, sadly.

143
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:13,159
And I don't believe you, partner.

144
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,204
But I'll give you 24 hours
to change your tune.

145
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,415
Be careful out there, Donald.

146
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,376
A lot of dangerous folk
still on the loose.

147
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,339
Might wanna watch your back.

148
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,804
Ronnie.

149
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,767
You said you needed my help,
but I'm done doing cleanup work.

150
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,187
Reggie. Thanks to your
and my father's machinations,

151
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,274
that thug Dodger Dickenson
and his crazy mom

152
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,734
ravaged my store.

153
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:51,072
They got away with half my stock,
not to mention an Ethiopian blue opal,

154
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,283
which you, Reginald,
are going to help me find.

155
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,453
Yeah, no.
Uh, this is not high school, Ronnie.

156
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,455
I work for one Lodge and it's not you.

157
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,249
How did that even happen?

158
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,794
My dad got into money trouble
and turned to your dad for help.

159
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,463
Now I'm working off my old man's debt.

160
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:12,218
Reggie, it's not too late to switch sides.
Fight with the good guys.

161
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,554
Nah. The bad guys pay better.

162
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,016
But I'll help you find your rock,
for old time's sake.

163
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,227
Thank you, Reggie.

164
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,358
Wow. So Jughead is taking
psychedelics to help him write now.

165
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,987
I guess I'm only sort of surprised,
actually.

166
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,949
I thought if I cuffed him,
he'd be contained until I came back.

167
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,660
But I couldn't stay. Not after...

168
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,786
What?

169
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:42,999
When he was high, he made a pass at me.
When I rebuffed him, he said...

170
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,959
What did he say?

171
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,795
He said, "Don't be such a Betty.

172
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,423
First sign of fun, you try to kill it."

173
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,387
Okay, um...

174
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:01,726
I'm sorry that Jughead put you
in this really awful position,

175
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,062
but he shouldn't really be
my problem anymore, or yours,

176
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,146
for that matter.

177
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,484
But, yeah, yeah. I'll help.

178
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,572
Last time I didn't act
on a missing person was my sister.

179
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,074
We'll start at the bunker.

180
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,702
- I wanna see it for myself.
- Thanks.

181
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,714
Hey, what are you giving him?
That's my prisoner.

182
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,507
Darla Dickenson?

183
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,677
Didn't realize I'd made
such an impression on you folks.

184
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,939
Mission accomplished.

185
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,274
In about two minutes,

186
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,486
Jeremiah won't be saying much
of anything to anyone.

187
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,490
Oh. And I hooked us
a little bonus prize too.

188
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,340
Well, he left his phone here.

189
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,175
That's never a good sign.

190
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,264
Okay. Although this will be
potentially cringey,

191
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,725
I think we should read
Jughead's manuscript.

192
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:29,605
See if there's any clues
about where he may have wandered off to.

193
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,191
We'll each take half.

194
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,904
What am I looking for?

195
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,827
Any conspicuous locations
or people that he mentions.

196
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,745
Anything that might be a lead.

197
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,339
Oh, what do we have here?

198
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,884
Fallen on hard times, friend?

199
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,596
Just trying to keep warm.

200
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,307
Hey, uh, wanna make some money?

201
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,517
No, I'm good.

202
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,812
No, really, take it. I insist.

203
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,596
My mom's building a case
to grant you an early release

204
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,307
because of your heroism
the night of the prison break.

205
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,268
If you help us find these convicts,
it should bolster your chances.

206
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,021
I'll help. Might even know
where some of them are hiding.

207
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,564
I also heard of convicts

208
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,442
squatting in a tuna warehouse
out on the docks.

209
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,652
Great. We'll start there.

210
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,988
- No answer?
- No. Straight to voicemail.

211
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,866
- Thanks for asking.
- Talked to your dad earlier.

212
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,284
He knew we were meeting here.

213
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,162
It's Riverdale. He could be doing
literally anything. Onwards.

214
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,707
- Are we going in armed?
- Yeah. Batons, Tasers and zip ties.

215
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,834
No guns. Minimal bloodshed.

216
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,044
Let's go get them.

217
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,801
All this stuff
about Mothmen and mole people.

218
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,721
Where did Jughead get the shrooms anyways?

219
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:29,600
His ex Jessica came up
from New York to deliver them.

220
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,477
Maybe he's reached out to her.

221
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,066
Seven years later,
still the same passcode.

222
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,238
Hey, Jones. How was your trip?

223
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,364
Is this Jessica?

224
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,115
Yeah, who the hell is this?

225
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,618
This is Betty Cooper. I'm...

226
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,827
Wait. The Betty?

227
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,747
Oh, my God.
I have so many questions for you.

228
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,126
I'm calling because you sold Jughead
mushrooms and now he's missing.

229
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,088
- Has he reached out to you?
- No.

230
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,590
But don't worry.
Sometimes when he has writer's block,

231
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,260
Jones goes on walkabouts, he calls them.

232
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,972
He's not blocked.
He wrote his book, such as it is.

233
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,808
I thought Diner Girl was supposed
to watch him.

234
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,184
He slipped past her.

235
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,770
Amateur. I'll come up to help you look.

236
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:18,232
- No, that's really not necessary...
- He owes me 500 bucks.

237
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,067
Text me your address.

238
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,654
Okay. Uh, well, I guess
we'll see you tomorrow.

239
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,032
Maybe she can actually help us.

240
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,952
Also I'm a little curious to meet her.

241
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:38,252
Efforts are afoot to rebuild Riverdale.

242
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:44,633
But this town shan't be saved
until its soul is saved.

243
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,468
What say ye?

244
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,178
May our souls be saved!

245
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,472
Amen, I say back to ye!

246
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:56,228
Now, give yourselves over
to the holy sweetness.

247
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:00,524
Drink of his sweet water and be saved.

248
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:04,695
Who exactly is he, Mumzie?

249
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,947
Whose sweet water are they tasting?

250
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,368
The sweetness of this water...

251
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,954
comes from a son

252
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,958
who died for the sins
and the darkness of this world.

253
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:18,918
Yes.

254
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,296
I speak of my son, Jason.

255
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,675
For years,
I searched to find meaning in his death.

256
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,386
But then, I realized something.

257
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,932
Jason was a sacrifice.

258
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:37,853
To lay bare the sins
of this accursed place.

259
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,563
And now it is up to us

260
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:44,318
to shepherd the soul of this township
back into the light.

261
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:46,946
To that end,

262
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:51,575
if you have any coins or bills
that you could spare, even a penny

263
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,245
will help to ensure
Riverdale's spiritual future.

264
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,497
Praise be.

265
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,841
I'm gonna drain the vein.

266
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,974
- What the...?
- What the hell?

267
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,477
There are warrants out for your arrest.
And we're taking you in.

268
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,564
You don't have guns.

269
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,192
That was a bad idea.

270
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,445
Drop it. Before I drop you.

271
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,573
Let's go.

272
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,329
What are you doing here?

273
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,583
Our old nemeses Dodger
and Darla Dickenson stole my blue opal.

274
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,210
I got one of the cons to spill.

275
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,839
Dodger was here talking up
some fancy rock, but slipped out

276
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,882
before you clowns stormed in.

277
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,051
That's my buyer.

278
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,178
He's getting restless. Okay.

279
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,264
I have to deal with him,
but, Archie, please,

280
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,933
I need you to find Dodger and Darla,
and get my opal back.

281
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,185
All right. Let me get this straight.

282
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,896
You went off to New York,
which I didn't want you to do,

283
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,525
you may have spent the night with your
husband, who didn't sign divorce papers.

284
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,652
- Now you want me to go find a rock?
- I'm sorry

285
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,738
about what happened with me and Chad.

286
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,532
But you're going after the Dickensons
no matter what, right?

287
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,951
Then you can get me my opal.

288
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,702
Fine.

289
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,796
Hey. You should rest.

290
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,673
You're banged up pretty bad.

291
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,677
- You changed my bandages?
- Yes, sir.

292
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,472
You got a fever. Probably an infection.

293
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,975
I gave you aspirin,
but what you need are antibiotics.

294
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,478
Sent a pal of mine out to score you some.

295
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,439
You're shivering.

296
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,522
Here.

297
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,362
Thanks.

298
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,826
Yeah, those guys,
they kicked the tar out of you.

299
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,537
You're lucky you're alive.

300
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,040
I'm lucky you were there.

301
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,959
- What's your name?
- Calvin.

302
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,586
But people call me Doc.

303
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,380
There's this one guy named Doc.

304
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,926
He would stay up all night just to make
sure the junkies didn't mess with me.

305
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,428
And one day, these drunken businessmen

306
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:20,057
who had heard about
our little shanty town, they found Doc...

307
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,020
and beat the life out of him.

308
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,856
I didn't move. I didn't say anything.

309
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,943
I watched.

310
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,570
What's yours?

311
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,447
Henry.

312
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,199
Well, Henry...

313
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,203
you wanna tell me
how you ended up on Sketch Alley?

314
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,748
I took some shrooms.

315
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,085
I had a bad trip.

316
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,046
I was in and out for a while.

317
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,507
And then I guess I...

318
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,551
wandered here.

319
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,722
I really should go. Thank you very much.

320
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,101
Hey, hey. You're not going anywhere.

321
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,771
Look, my friend will be back soon.
And until then, you sleep.

322
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,025
There you go.

323
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,446
Donald, it's Hiram.

324
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,577
I have some new information regarding
what we were discussing earlier.

325
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,956
If you can meet me ASAP,
I'm at the office.

326
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,418
Satisfied?

327
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,088
Not until I get my share of the palladium.

328
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,215
Or you're dead.

329
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:36,967
Or both.

330
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,852
Archie said
Jughead has been living in here.

331
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,521
Oh, my God.

332
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,233
Jessica, what do you think?

333
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,736
Our apartment back in New York
was even messier.

334
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,779
What the hell
has he been doing these days?

335
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,532
The maple mushrooms I gave Jones

336
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,826
shouldn't have triggered
a psychotic episode.

337
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,287
- Was he taking anything else?
- Not that I know of.

338
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,875
We should confirm that.
Luckily, I know all about hiding places.

339
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,293
Especially his.

340
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,298
We can search for him and his stashes,

341
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,468
see if there are any other drugs
he might have been sampling.

342
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,851
Where else could he be hiding out?

343
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,603
Or hiding contraband?

344
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:34,358
Well, it's a long shot, but he did live
under the stairs at Riverdale High once.

345
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:38,237
- Has a desk there, same as the rest of us.
- That's our next stop.

346
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,422
Well, he is not in the teacher's lounge.

347
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,759
He's not under the stairs.

348
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,471
Pretty sure he's not hiding
in a desk drawer.

349
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,933
Where would he have done most
of his writing, if not here or his crib?

350
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,602
The bunker but we already checked it.

351
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:14,314
But you don't know
what we're looking for. Take me there.

352
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,649
Okay.

353
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,446
You're shameless, Mumzie.

354
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:25,492
Swindling those people out of their money
whilst defiling the memory of Jay-Jay.

355
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,703
I am doing no such thing.

356
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,455
I've spent enough time
with corpses to know the truth.

357
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,332
There is no invisible world,

358
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,710
just eternal rot.

359
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,712
We are worm food at best.

360
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,090
- Do you honestly believe that?
- Well...

361
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,761
there was a time when I wanted
to believe in something more.

362
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,684
A time when I thought I was speaking
to Jay-Jay in the beyond.

363
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,853
But you ruined that.

364
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,898
Your gaslighting, your lies,
your deranged Julian doll.

365
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,736
You showed me
that there is nothing eternal.

366
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,196
Just the cruelty of mothers.

367
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,868
Any faith I had went up in flames
when I gave Jason his Viking funeral.

368
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,375
But, Cheryl, there is a realm
beyond this mortal coil

369
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,045
where maple syrup flows in rivers.

370
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,505
Don't you wanna be part
of something larger?

371
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,715
Of course I do.

372
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,552
I just don't think
you're a part of it, Mother.

373
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,939
Daddy, I can't talk right now.

374
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,775
Veronica Lodge.

375
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:44,613
You don't know me, but my associates
and I have taken your father hostage.

376
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,365
See, he owes me something
and he won't give it over.

377
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,494
So if you wanna see him
or his fellow captives,

378
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,163
Governor Dooley or Sheriff Keller,
alive again,

379
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,083
- you better follow my instructions.
- What do you want?

380
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,166
Palladium.

381
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:01,254
We dug it out of the ground
for your father and now we want our share.

382
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,424
But he won't tell us where it is.

383
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,469
So I thought maybe
you could get through to him.

384
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,807
We're at the El Royale,
there's three of them...

385
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,558
Daddy?

386
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,938
Do not cooperate with these thugs.

387
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,064
What's palladium?

388
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,024
I don't know.

389
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:21,942
Daddy?

390
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:26,696
That was Double D putting a bullet
into Governor Dooley's stomach.

391
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,367
It'll probably take a few hours
for him to bleed out.

392
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,703
The next bullet goes into your father.

393
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,749
So if you wanna save their lives,

394
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,626
find me that palladium!

395
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,002
Wait, Double D?

396
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:45,006
Is Dodger Dickenson there?
And does he have a blue opal?

397
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,590
He might.

398
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,763
I'll get you the palladium,
but I want my father and the others back.

399
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,431
And my opal.

400
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,683
- Deal.
- I'll be in touch.

401
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,019
What was that about?

402
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,229
Reggie...

403
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,023
...what do you know
about my dad and palladium?

404
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:09,239
Okay. Now I'm officially worried.
Dad has never been out of touch this long.

405
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,825
Your dad's been
in tough spots before, Kev.

406
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,494
He'll be okay. We're gonna find him.

407
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,123
- Veronica?
- Archie, where are you?

408
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,500
Home. We haven't found Dodger
or his mom yet.

409
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,336
I know where they are.
They're with some other guy named Ted.

410
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,420
Oh, crap.

411
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,594
I know that guy. He's a beast.

412
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,597
They're holed up at the El Royale
and they're keeping my father,

413
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,765
Governor Dooley
and Sheriff Keller hostage.

414
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,683
Wait, what?

415
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:40,645
They're looking for palladium.
Reggie thinks he knows where it is.

416
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,940
- Can you meet us at Daddy's office?
- We're on our way.

417
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,943
I know where your dad is.

418
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,532
Confirmed.
My father is literally Lex Luthor.

419
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,576
If he's hiding any palladium,
it's in there.

420
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,205
Archie, you still ride
with those tools in your truck?

421
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,416
Yes, I do.
Do you guys wanna give me a hand?

422
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,879
And I will track down a dolly.

423
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,680
Well done, fellas.

424
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:21,186
Depressing.
I can see why Jones likes this place.

425
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,446
- Damn it. Where is it?
- What are you even looking for?

426
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,365
Jones's manuscript.

427
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,786
Uh, I have it. I took it
when we searched this place earlier.

428
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:42,332
Can I read it? Is there anything in there
that will help us find Jones?

429
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,709
Not that we could pinpoint.

430
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,919
Okay.

431
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,216
Mmm... New idea.

432
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,262
If this is where he tripped,
should we do the same?

433
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,388
I'm sorry. What?

434
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,015
I have shrooms,
from the same batch I gave Jones.

435
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,894
If we take some,
maybe we could see what he saw,

436
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,021
experience what he experienced.

437
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,232
It'll be like retracing his steps.

438
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,110
Give us a sec?
We've just never tripped before.

439
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,028
- Yeah.
- Just gonna...

440
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,614
We're not gonna do that.

441
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,616
- What is she trying to pull?
- I don't know.

442
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,286
She gave him drugs.
She's trying to get us to take drugs.

443
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,329
She's got multiple agendas.

444
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:25,333
This was, I think, a really bad idea.

445
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,085
- Let's pivot.
- New new idea.

446
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,256
I wonder if I should go back to New York.

447
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,425
You two have Riverdale covered,

448
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:37,053
but what if Jughead is on his way
back there to confront his demons?

449
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,348
- That might be a good idea.
- Could be. Good idea.

450
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,350
But it is a long ride back.

451
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,811
Can we grab a bite before I go?

452
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,815
Jones couldn't stop talking about Pop's
when I met him.

453
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,359
Yeah. For sure.

454
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,237
Okay. Come on, ladies. It'll be my treat.

455
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,292
- I didn't ask you for a thing.
- Good point.

456
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,836
- I didn't ask you for anything.
- Doc?

457
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,915
- Did you get the palladium?
- Yes, but there's a catch.

458
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,293
It's locked in a safe.
We have it but not the combination.

459
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,921
- Luckily...
- I have the man who does.

460
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,924
All right. But you make the delivery.

461
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,093
Not your boyfriend. Just you.

462
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,348
Deal. I'll be there in half an hour.

463
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,935
I give you the safe, you give me my opal
and free the hostages.

464
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,814
And Archie tells me you're a military man,
so I know you'll honor your word.

465
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,275
What's the plan, boys?

466
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,612
Once I'm inside,
I can buy us, say, 30 seconds.

467
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,697
Ted knows the El Royale.

468
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,283
- He'll have eyes on all the entrances.
- No, not all.

469
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:26,329
When I took over, I put in a new roof.
There's a skylight covered with tar paper.

470
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,416
We tear it off and drop in like Batman
with the element of surprise.

471
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,836
He doesn't know you're with us,
Uncle Frank, which gives us an advantage.

472
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,879
They've got my dad. I'm going in too.

473
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,965
- Count me in as well.
- Same.

474
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,634
Good. We'll need the manpower against Ted.

475
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:42,781
You really didn't have to do that.
I own this diner.

476
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,575
No way. I love splurging on new friends.

477
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,287
It's a lesson I live by.
Help out when you can.

478
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,540
And maybe don't leave people alone
when they're tripping on mushrooms.

479
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,168
I assumed he'd be safe in the handcuffs.

480
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,586
Well, another lesson,

481
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,756
maybe don't give psychedelic shrooms
to someone in a delicate state.

482
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,300
How about don't betray your boyfriend
the way you did?

483
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:07,180
Getting with his best friend,
that's some Shakespearean-level treachery.

484
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,515
Okay. Yeah.

485
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,559
Clearly, in the stories
Jughead has been telling,

486
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,855
he's cast himself
as the blameless victim here.

487
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,525
But Jughead's not so innocent.

488
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:23,905
Yeah, no, actually,
he left me this voicemail,

489
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,490
mmm, two years ago.

490
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,284
Betty, where the hell are you?

491
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:32,247
You said you were gonna come to
my release party, but, what, you bailed?

492
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,833
Of course you bailed.

493
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,669
You've just been blowing me off for years.

494
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,963
Why should I have expected
anything different?

495
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,506
You know, I see you.

496
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:45,593
I see what I should have seen
seven years ago.

497
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,721
You pretend to be nice,
but you're only looking for weak spots.

498
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,392
And when you find them,
you press on them like a bruise.

499
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,435
Like when you hooked up with Archie?

500
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:59,941
You know, you found the one person
that would hurt both me and Veronica,

501
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,360
and you just went there.

502
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,988
You're a cold, fake, duplicitous bitch.

503
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,866
And once people read my book,
everyone's gonna see that.

504
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:08,950
Wow.

505
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,704
- That's darkness.
- Yep.

506
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,081
I was living with Jughead then.

507
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,544
Yeah. Things were good for a while.

508
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,464
But then these writing deadlines started
to get the best of him,

509
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,385
and he started spiraling
into this destructive behavior.

510
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,638
To be fair, so did I.
I'm a writer as well.

511
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,307
We cared about each other.

512
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,560
We just weren't good for each other.

513
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,645
I couldn't be around that energy.

514
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,565
So I got out.

515
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,363
Mmm. Are you guys hot?

516
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,783
I'm feeling hot.

517
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,035
Oh, crap.

518
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,915
I feel bad now, but I'm just gonna say it.

519
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,752
When I got the fries, I sprinkled
some dried mushrooms on them.

520
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,337
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

521
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,130
- They tasted different.
- I'm sorry.

522
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:08,760
I was gonna chill until you guys started
tripping, then grab the manuscript.

523
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,471
- Is that why you came here?
- Why didn't you ask for it?

524
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:16,059
Probably PTSD from asking Jughead if
I could read whatever he was working on,

525
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,061
and then him biting my head off.

526
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,605
We should get you guys some place safe.

527
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:27,904
What is so important about this manuscript
that you would drug us to get it?

528
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,530
It's literal gibberish.

529
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,159
After he used you as fodder
for The Outcasts,

530
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,787
I was afraid
he'd write about our time in New York.

531
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,916
And I really don't want my parents
or my friends reading that.

532
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,255
Go ahead.

533
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,259
He probably won't even remember
writing it.

534
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,552
If he ever turns up.

535
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,265
I'm sure you don't want any more advice,

536
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,769
but just let the trip take you
wherever it may go.

537
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,438
It should be gentle and mellow.

538
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:06,109
Ride it out together.
Don't fight it. Okay?

539
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,868
Just let the tunes wash over you.

540
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,413
And thanks for understanding.

541
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:23,079
- Search her.
- Show me the blue opal first.

542
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,208
Okay. Now you can search me.

543
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,422
Isn't it fab?
It's from Lacy's new fall line.

544
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,843
A dozen hidden pockets
for that businesswoman on the go.

545
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,803
Better not be wasting my time.

546
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,598
And that's 30 seconds, you Neanderthal.

547
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,408
I take it, that's worth a lot.

548
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,868
It is.

549
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:48,664
Tomorrow, I'll hand it over to my buyer,
but tonight, this blue baby is all mine.

550
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,667
Thanks to you and your A-Team.

551
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,838
So when the governor
regains consciousness,

552
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,758
we'll be asking him
to give your uncle a full pardon.

553
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,968
I won't say no to that, Ronnie.

554
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,013
So...

555
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,893
we're still feeling good
about our decision?

556
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,230
To hold off until my divorce is final?

557
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,899
Yeah.

558
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,110
But I am torn.

559
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,781
Well, then...

560
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:28,704
I better work on making this divorce
happen as fast as humanly possible.

561
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,417
I'll be seeing you soon, Archie.

562
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,592
Thought you might like an update.

563
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,011
Where's the palladium?

564
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,764
That doesn't really matter because...

565
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,933
I'm not sharing.

566
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,769
Not now, not ever.

567
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,272
I've moved heaven and earth to get here.

568
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,649
I've dedicated years of my life
to this cause.

569
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,317
You have no idea.

570
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,404
So as soon as you're healthy enough,

571
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:06,867
I suggest you go back to that cushy,
little mansion of yours and never return.

572
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,371
Or else.

573
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,083
Are we clear?

574
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,128
Yeah.

575
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,890
Good morning. Feeling better?

576
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,020
- Yeah.
- My friend came by with the antibiotics.

577
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,813
Gave them to you while you were out.

578
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,858
Hey, that guy...

579
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:40,818
- Did I...?
- Kill him?

580
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,112
Nah. But you knocked him out.

581
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:47,366
Dragged him to the edge of Sketch Alley
and dumped him on the curb.

582
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,786
Someone will find him.
But you need to get home.

583
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:53,914
Well, I can't yet.

584
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,292
And why is that?

585
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,341
Something happened to me in New York.

586
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,635
I know it's something horrible,
I just can't remember what.

587
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,514
I keep getting these... delusions.

588
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,184
They're like images or memories, maybe.

589
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,353
And I, uh...

590
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,191
I just know I can't go home
until I... figure it out.

591
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,360
Sounds like you know
where you're going, then.

592
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,407
My name is not... Henry, it's...

593
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,952
- Jughead. I know.
- You knew?

594
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,414
Well, not right away
but I figure you had your reasons.

595
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,879
I'm so sorry,
for everything that happened. I...

596
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,007
- I wish I would have done something.
- You were a kid.

597
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:50,763
There's nothing you could have done.
Now, you just focus on yourself.

598
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,182
Find your way back
from wherever it is you've been.

599
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,769
Thanks, Doc.

600
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,315
I'll come back and see you.

601
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,284
Oh, my God.

602
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,414
How many days did we sleep through?

603
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,875
A week and a half, it feels like.

604
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:28,217
Oh, my gosh.
Did I give Jessica Jughead's manuscript?

605
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,720
You did. Yep.

606
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,516
And you played his message.

607
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,394
The message for us.

608
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,354
Oh, God.

609
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,356
It's okay, Betty. It is a...

610
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,360
secret amongst friends.

611
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,994
And, look, I know
we haven't found Jughead, but, um...

612
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,665
what you're doing,
looking for those missing girls?

613
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,625
I wanna help.

614
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,548
I appreciate that, Tabitha.

615
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,685
Speaking of messages...

616
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,105
It's Jughead.

617
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,566
Is he okay? What's he saying?

618
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,319
Oh, God. Where to start?

619
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:33,157
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I haven't called.

620
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,075
I'm just sorry for everything.

621
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,495
If you blame yourself
about me wandering off, don't.

622
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,247
I was high out of my mind.

623
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,791
I'm fine. I'm safe, more or less.

624
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,712
I'm heading to New York.
There's something I need to confront.

625
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:50,007
I'm not sure what, but I wouldn't
have gotten this far without you.

626
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:54,053
When I get back to Riverdale,
maybe we can finish that dance. Okay.
