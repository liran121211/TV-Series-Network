1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,011
Michael Corleone,
Tony Soprano, Scarface.

2
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:15,223
All ruthless gangsters.
All heroes of their own story.

3
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,058
And every hero...

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:22,230
...has an origin story,
including Hiram Lodge.

5
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:27,652
Even though he's been Riverdale's
chief tormentor for ten years now,

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,571
shockingly little is known about him...

7
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,906
how he came to be...

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,785
and why he's obsessed
with destroying our poor town.

9
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,997
What is his "Rosebud" as it were?

10
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,420
And why does he collect
lost souls like Reggie Mantle?

11
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,808
And why are
the Reggie Mantles of the world...

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,104
drawn to Hiram Lodge like moths to flame?

13
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,575
- That was a short day.
- I have an errand, Dad. I'll be back.

14
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,619
Well, you better be back by 10.

15
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,788
- We got...
- McPharlins coming in. I know.

16
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,207
I said I'll be back.

17
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,543
And you are certain it's him?

18
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,714
There is no room for error here.

19
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,382
Wow.

20
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,094
Great work.

21
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,892
No. This is personal.
I'll handle it myself.

22
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,769
Tonight.

23
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,991
Reggie. You are not on my calendar.

24
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,497
That's my father's debt to you.

25
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,957
All of it.

26
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,752
Mr. Lodge,
I appreciate you bailing my old man out

27
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,379
when his business was in trouble.

28
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,341
But this makes him square, right?

29
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,467
That it does.

30
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:21,558
The only question I have is:
What does this mean for our arrangement?

31
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,727
Well, the truth is,
I'd like to keep working for you.

32
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,189
But I want real advancement.
I'm good with numbers.

33
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,984
And I have ideas.

34
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,695
Some big, big ideas.

35
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:41,327
Okay, I tell you what, Reggie,
I will find a privileged place for you

36
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,913
if you do me one last favor.

37
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,208
I need you to get me a gun.

38
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,295
A ghost gun, one that can't be traced.

39
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,008
- Is that a problem for you?
- No, sir. No problem.

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,553
I'll bring it to you
after my last shift at the lot.

41
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,472
You will not find a better deal
in all of Riverdale.

42
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,101
Come on, Sam, you're not gonna
cheap out on your son, are you?

43
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,269
Excuse me?

44
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,647
Let's go, Sean.

45
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,942
Let me ask you, Mr. McPharlin.

46
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,029
Do you remember your first car?

47
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,700
Mine was a 1970 Chevelle.
I named her Bella.

48
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,329
And boy, oh, boy, the memories
Bella and I made together...

49
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:28,583
Cruising, going on dates,
late nights at the drive-in.

50
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,711
Mine was named Red Ruby.

51
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,839
She was an '84 Challenger.

52
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,133
Mr. McPharlin,

53
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,512
this is the car
your son will pick up his prom date in.

54
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,598
The car he'll take with him to college.

55
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,975
The car he'll get laid in.

56
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,562
We'll take it. Right, Dad?

57
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,402
I was gonna close that deal.

58
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,905
You didn't need to step in there
with that trash talk.

59
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,531
You're getting rusty.

60
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,492
- I have a half a mind to...
- To what?

61
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,412
Beat me like you used to?

62
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,082
Go ahead and try, old man.

63
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,542
I'm not in high school anymore.

64
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,796
It's the sale that matters.

65
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,924
Set some of that money aside
for this month's payment to Hiram.

66
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,218
I took care of Hiram. It's over.

67
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,094
We're paid off.

68
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,933
Is that true? You don't have
to work for that gangster anymore?

69
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,311
That gangster pulled your ass
out of the fire.

70
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,356
- I'm still gonna work for him.
- Why?

71
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,193
What about our dream
about being partners? Full partners.

72
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,237
That's your dream, Dad.

73
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,156
From where I'm standing,
my future is with Hiram.

74
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,577
I gotta go.

75
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,750
Hiram, I'm asking you,
just leave my son alone.

76
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,169
The debt's paid. Just let him go.

77
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,381
Reggie is a grown man
who makes his own decisions.

78
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,549
Reggie is a fool.

79
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,844
He's blinded by your money.
Doesn't care how you get it.

80
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,680
Maybe you're failing
to see your own son's potential.

81
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,349
If he were my son, I'd be proud of him.

82
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,855
Hiram, I swear, if you don't let him go...

83
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,483
Choose... your next words wisely.

84
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,654
Or better yet...
get the hell out of my office.

85
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,830
Untraceable, like you asked.

86
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,913
Excellent.

87
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:38,296
Reggie, your father came to see me.
He, uh, stormed in, made wild demands.

88
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,133
If you're gonna work for me,
get your house in order first.

89
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,635
- I'm so sorry...
- Don't apologize. Fix it.

90
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,972
Then meet me back here tonight.

91
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,143
You went to see Hiram Lodge
behind my back.

92
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,063
Dad, you don't get
to speak for me. Not anymore.

93
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,358
Can't even look at you. I'm so ashamed.

94
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,442
Me...?

95
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,448
Nothing I ever do is good enough
for you, is it?

96
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,452
But just because your life is crap

97
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,038
doesn't give you the right
to take it out on me.

98
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,372
You beat me.

99
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,336
You punched down at me my whole damn life.

100
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,087
But I stayed.

101
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,633
After all you did...

102
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,636
I stayed.

103
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,930
Not anymore.

104
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,645
You know...

105
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,525
Hiram has done more with his life...

106
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,944
than you ever will.

107
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,695
And as far as I know,

108
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,656
he never laid a finger

109
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,367
on his wife or daughter.

110
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,335
- How'd it go with your father?
- I don't have a father anymore.

111
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,881
- That's a rather bold statement.
- I mean it.

112
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,260
Of that, I have no doubt.

113
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,056
It reminds me
of my relationship with my father.

114
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,642
He didn't approve of your business either?

115
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,310
To put it mildly.

116
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,186
Where is he now?

117
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,860
Therein lies a tale.

118
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,619
All done.

119
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,712
I must have left my wallet
in my other jacket.

120
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,384
- It's okay. Just pay me double next time.
- No, no, no.

121
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,889
I tell you what,
I got something better than cash.

122
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,768
That, my friend, is palladium.

123
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,771
It's a precious metal
worth more than gold.

124
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,275
That tiny piece alone
would fetch you $100.

125
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,320
- Where'd you get it?
- An old buddy of mine told me

126
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,405
there are unmined veins
of palladium upstate,

127
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,825
in a small Rockland County town
called Riverdale.

128
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,370
- Riverdale? On the Sweetwater River?
- Yes, sir.

129
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,832
You head north to Riverdale,
it might just change your life.

130
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,641
The promise of buried palladium had...

131
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,936
captured my father's imagination.

132
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,187
So we moved...

133
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,816
- Me, my father, my mother.
- -to an apartment in Riverdale.

134
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,779
- And was there palladium?
- There were mines.

135
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,659
My father got a job at one,
but after six months,

136
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,993
there was a collapse.

137
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,915
He survived, but the mines were shut down.

138
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,417
And no palladium?

139
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,213
Rumors of it. But no.

140
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,927
But my father decided
we would stay in Riverdale,

141
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,471
make our American dreams come true.

142
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,350
My mom got a job waiting tables at Pop's.

143
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,102
- She's not going yet?
- She's not.

144
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,939
Here's some hot dogs for you.
Pancakes for you. Anything else?

145
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,315
No. Thank you.

146
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,740
While my father and I returned
to our old line of work.

147
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,204
- All done. Five dollars, sir.
- Gotta be joking.

148
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,416
- They're still all scuffed up in front.
- I've done my best, sir.

149
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,750
Not good enough, pal.

150
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,087
Hey! You need to pay us.

151
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,422
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

152
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,132
Jaime, just let it go.

153
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,676
It's just one shine, that's all.

154
00:09:56,345 --> 00:10:00,683
After the mine collapse,
my father seemed somehow diminished.

155
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,146
You know, the...
The light in his eyes had dimmed.

156
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,610
In time,
we became fixtures outside of Pop's.

157
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:15,698
Our customer base grew. I was polishing
as many shoes as my father.

158
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,330
That's good enough, kid.

159
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,295
I don't know
if I can make change for this.

160
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,756
- Consider it a tip for a job well done.
- Thank you.

161
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,840
Yeah, no problem.

162
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,970
Listen, if you're ever looking
for extra work,

163
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,222
you come see me at Cucina Sacasa.

164
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,849
I might have something for you.

165
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,687
Have a good evening, gentlemen.

166
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,196
Ah-ah. Don't be fooled, Jaime.

167
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,325
That man is a gangster.

168
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,951
His money is blood money.

169
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,911
All right?

170
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,458
Hey, Hermione.

171
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,341
You can ask me out every day, Jaime,
but my answer will always be the same. No.

172
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,301
Come on. Why not?

173
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,554
My mother sort of forbids it.

174
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:27,395
She doesn't want me to date the son
of a man who shines shoes for a living.

175
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,400
With all due respect,
your mom cleans toilets

176
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,903
and changes bedsheets at the Five Seasons.
What's the difference?

177
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,280
I'm really sorry.

178
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,033
She just wants what's best for me.

179
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,037
But for what it's worth,
I do think you're cute.

180
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,582
Hermione's words
cut me to the bone.

181
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,796
As long as I shined shoes for a living,
I was a second-class citizen.

182
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,091
But I refused to accept that.

183
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,302
- Is that what I have to know?
- Yeah.

184
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,504
I'd like to work for you, sir.

185
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,519
- Sure.
- Why is that?

186
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,107
Because you have two things I don't.
Money and respect.

187
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,071
It's not respect, kid. It's fear.

188
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,866
- There's a big difference.
- I wanna be feared too.

189
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,870
- What's your name?
- I'm Jaime Luna, sir.

190
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,248
I'm Vittorio Alto.
My friends call me Vito.

191
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,375
Your pop know you came to see me?

192
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,877
No, sir.

193
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,466
You got guts.

194
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:52,521
All right. I got a delivery for you
to make. Think you can handle it?

195
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,733
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

196
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,952
- What do you want?
- I have a delivery from Vito Alto.

197
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,288
Good.

198
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,923
You don't look like
one of Vito's typical employees.

199
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,176
- What's your name?
- Jaime Luna.

200
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,719
You people.

201
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,723
You work twice as fast for half the pay.

202
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,064
This is for Vito.

203
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,446
Thanks, kid. Any problems?

204
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,824
The guy I delivered to made comments
that didn't sit well with me.

205
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,036
About my background, you know?
Where I come from.

206
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Join me.

207
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,548
This guy, that's Louie.

208
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,343
Everybody knows Louie's a clown.
You don't take that personally.

209
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,473
I try not to,
but sometimes it makes me really angry.

210
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,559
Still, you kept your cool.

211
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,602
And in this business,
that means everything.

212
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,688
- Understand me?
- Yes, sir.

213
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,690
Cheer up, kid.

214
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,568
Easiest money you're ever gonna make.

215
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,530
And there's plenty more...

216
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,534
if you wanna keep making deliveries.

217
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,540
- You can count on me, boss.
- Good boy.

218
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:39,420
Vito was right. The money I earned
delivering packages in one week

219
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,715
eclipsed what I would've made
shining shoes for two months.

220
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,677
Whoever said
money couldn't buy happiness was a sucker.

221
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,970
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey.

222
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,891
I haven't seen much of you.
Where you been?

223
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,518
Got a job at that fancy Italian place.

224
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,855
- I make deliveries.
- Very nice shoes for a delivery boy.

225
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,690
You know.

226
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,484
Pays well...

227
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,154
and I get good tips.

228
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,285
With money also came confidence.

229
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,427
And I needed every ounce of it
to win over Hermione Gomez.

230
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,183
So how about that date, gorgeous?
You know I'm nothing if not persistent.

231
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,936
Perhaps to a fault, Jaime.

232
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,148
You know what?

233
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,526
You twisted my arm.

234
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,864
I'll allow you to buy me dinner
at Pop's tonight. How does that sound?

235
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,033
Sounds great. Seven?

236
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,836
Order anything on the menu.
Order it all if you want.

237
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,882
Didn't realize there was money
in the shoeshine business.

238
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,384
Well, there isn't.

239
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,345
But that doesn't stop my dad
from working like a dog,

240
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,348
day in and day out,
to provide for my mom and me.

241
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,474
I can relate.

242
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,270
My mother's sacrificed so much
working at the Five Seasons...

243
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,065
all to make my life easier.

244
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,902
- I wish there was a way to repay her.
- Exactly.

245
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,655
It's the reason I got this other job.

246
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,533
Oh, yeah? Where? Doing what?

247
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,453
Making deliveries for Vittorio Alto.

248
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,166
You mean, Vito, the gangster?

249
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,836
Mr. Alto's a businessman.

250
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,672
Working for him is gonna be
my ticket out of Riverdale.

251
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,757
What can I get you two?

252
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,469
A hamburger
with a side of onion rings, please.

253
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,806
And same for me, Pop.
And a chocolate shake. Two straws.

254
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:03,981
And if you did make it out of Riverdale,
where would you go?

255
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,360
I'd be living in a penthouse
in New York City,

256
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,946
running my own business.

257
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,574
- What, did I say something funny?
- No.

258
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,411
In fact, as it so happens...

259
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,497
- ...I wanna live in Manhattan too.
- Are you Jaime Luna?

260
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,459
Yeah. What's the problem?

261
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,378
You're under arrest
for trafficking of a Class II narcotic.

262
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,589
You have the right to remain silent.

263
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,992
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

264
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,596
This is no joke, kid.

265
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,391
We know what operation's being run
out of that Italian place.

266
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:43,520
Look, give us the name of your supplier,
and you can walk out of here

267
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,397
and get back to your date at the diner.

268
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,690
How does that sound?

269
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,944
I've got nothing to say to you.

270
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,655
How does that sound?

271
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:01,997
Mr. Alto?

272
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,210
- How can we help you?
- I'm here about Jaime Luna.

273
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,128
He's in trouble.

274
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,597
Your bail's been posted.

275
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,765
You're free to go.

276
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,227
Did you talk?

277
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,104
Not a word.

278
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,566
- Who'd you call?
- No one.

279
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,577
- Not even your family?
- Especially not my family.

280
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,163
They'd be so ashamed of me.

281
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,498
Sit down.

282
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,134
You're a good boy, Jaime.
You protected me.

283
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,386
In turn, you protected my business.

284
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,518
I'm proud of you.

285
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,898
- Here.
- Thank you, sir.

286
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:14,361
You've proven yourself. I'm gonna give you
a bump up. No more deliveries.

287
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:18,115
From now on, you're gonna be collecting.
That makes you part of the inner circle.

288
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,950
Thank you, Vito. Really.

289
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,911
- Can I impart a friendly advice, kid?
- Always.

290
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,997
You afraid to call your folks at home?

291
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:31,003
Way I see that, you're still worrying
about other people's expectations

292
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,005
when you should be worrying
about yourself.

293
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,091
You gotta be your own man,

294
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,385
especially if you wanna make it
in this business.

295
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,429
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, sir.

296
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:45,559
Good. By the way, you better marry
that pretty girl who came by here earlier.

297
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,519
Hermione? She came here?

298
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,190
She's got her head screwed on right.
And she had your back when you needed it.

299
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,900
You don't let her get away.

300
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,824
- I might have blown my one shot with her.
- I wouldn't be so sure of that.

301
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,662
Especially since I got you something,
a bonus to go with your promotion.

302
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,124
Hey.

303
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,961
I thought
tonight we could finish our date.

304
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,630
- Don't even try.
- Fine.

305
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,508
Well, if not that,
then at least let me give you a ride home.

306
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,684
I'm thinking about
changing my name.

307
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,146
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

308
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,274
I'm tired of living
in someone else's shadow.

309
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,193
I wanna be my own man.

310
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,447
What are you planning to call yourself?

311
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,076
Well, I was thinking Hiram Lott.

312
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,287
As in, I'm gonna have a lot in life.

313
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,916
Hiram sounds nice.

314
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,751
Strong.

315
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,919
Unique.

316
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,129
But Lott?

317
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:03,720
I think you can do better.
How about something statelier like Lodge?

318
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,139
Hiram Lodge.

319
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,309
That's not half bad.

320
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,202
"Fred Andrews."

321
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,911
Here.

322
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,539
"Jaime Luna"?

323
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,960
I go by a different name now.

324
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,170
You can call me Hiram Lodge.

325
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,757
Uh-huh. Have you filled out the paperwork?

326
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,343
It's being processed
at the courthouse as we speak.

327
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:48,056
Luna or Lodge, you'll still be shining
my old man's shoes for burgers, Jaime.

328
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,036
What's my name, Mantle?

329
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,620
Say it!

330
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,081
I wanna hear you say it.

331
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,919
- Hiram Lodge.
- That's right. Don't you ever forget it.

332
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,158
I got a call from your school.

333
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:52,162
You beat up two students
'cause they wouldn't call you Hiram Lodge?

334
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,878
Are you crazy?

335
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,964
You forsake our family name
for what? For vanity?

336
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,300
You think I'm a fool?

337
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,055
I know
where you're getting all this money.

338
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,225
It's from that damn gangster.

339
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,434
So what?

340
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,727
So what?

341
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,605
It's dishonest!
More than that, it's criminal.

342
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,694
- That man will ruin you, Jaime.
- It's Hiram.

343
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,322
I'm doing what I'm doing for you and Mom.

344
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,492
To give you the things you deserve,
things you can't afford.

345
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,285
You sad, stupid boy.

346
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,456
Working for the likes of Vito, are you...?

347
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,501
It's gonna cost you everything.

348
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,548
Everything you love, Jaime.
You brought shame to this family.

349
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,717
Then it's a good thing
I'm not a Luna anymore, Dad.

350
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,386
I don't wanna be like you,

351
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:53,098
spending my days shining
the shoes of men who look down on me.

352
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,768
You can lecture me
all you want about shame,

353
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,063
but you can't buy Mom a dishwasher

354
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,023
or new shoes for yourself.

355
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,485
It's embarrassing.

356
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:10,407
Being your son... is embarrassing.

357
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,845
Mr. Vito, with all due respect,

358
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,015
I want you to leave my son alone.

359
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,019
He's a good boy but impressionable.

360
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:45,442
Tell me, Javier,
do you not want your son to be successful?

361
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,904
He's got nice things, a pretty girlfriend.

362
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,532
Seems to me your son's old enough
to make his own decisions.

363
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,328
I think you misunderstand me.

364
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,165
I'm not asking you.

365
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,251
I'm telling you.

366
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,715
Whatever arrangement exists
between you and my son, it's over.

367
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,677
Or what? What are you gonna do?

368
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:15,889
I'll call the police...

369
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:21,144
and tell them everything about you
and your dirty business.

370
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,023
I see.

371
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:32,781
Well, in that case, maybe you can, uh,
let me think it over, compadre.

372
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,159
I'll be in touch.

373
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,795
My... My father was a smart man.

374
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:53,301
He believed human nature was good.

375
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,928
But...

376
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,933
he was wrong.

377
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,815
- How you doing today, Javier?
- Hey. Morning, Pop.

378
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,235
It's gonna be a good day. I can feel it.

379
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,092
Hit it!

380
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,493
Hiram,

381
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,415
Lourdes, I'm Apollonia, Hermione's mother.

382
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,418
- I'm very sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

383
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,963
Javier seemed like a warm and caring man.

384
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,007
Thank you for coming, Mrs. Gomez.

385
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,259
He was a good man.

386
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,262
Even for a lowly shoe shiner.

387
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,349
I, uh...

388
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,561
I misjudged him.

389
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,272
I'm not proud of that.

390
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,859
- My deepest apologies, Hiram.
- Thank you.

391
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,364
He seems so calm.

392
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:41,493
It's shock, I think.
He hasn't said much since it happened.

393
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,245
Mm. Such a tragedy.

394
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:49,209
I suppose, but you know
what they say about playing with fire...

395
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,170
- What are you getting at, Penelope?
- I'm just pointing out.

396
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,214
One day,
he can't rub two nickels together.

397
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:58,259
The next, he's driving a sports car
and taking you out on the town.

398
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,844
We all know the truth.

399
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,972
Your boyfriend is a gangster.

400
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,601
What did Jaime think would happen
when he started working with criminals?

401
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,311
His name is Hiram.

402
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,355
As for what he thought would happen,

403
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,608
he thought he'd be able
to make a better life for his family.

404
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,611
Family is more important to him
than anything.

405
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,530
Can either of you skanks say the same?

406
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,540
- Hey.
- Hey.

407
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,460
Are you hanging in there?

408
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,587
Hmph. Trying.

409
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,091
I just want you to know,

410
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,220
whatever you need, I'm here for you, okay?

411
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,606
Thank you.

412
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,576
Mrs. Luna, I wanted to come
in person to pay my respects.

413
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,954
Your husband, he was a good man,

414
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,831
an honest man.

415
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,459
His kindness will be missed.

416
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,630
I'm sorry for your loss.

417
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,884
Take as much time as you need, kid.

418
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,929
When you're ready to come back to work,

419
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,474
come see me
and we'll pick up where we left off.

420
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,645
No disrespect for the dead
but now, at least,

421
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,064
you can become the man
that you were destined to be.

422
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,405
Forget about that. Right now,
I want you to focus on your mother.

423
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,993
Okay? Whatever she needs,
whatever you need, you come see me.

424
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,163
Capiche?

425
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Thanks, Vito.

426
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:20,193
I am so lucky
that I still have you, Jaime.

427
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,405
But I beg you,

428
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,408
please be done with this nasty business.

429
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,663
I promise you, I will.

430
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:48,137
Hey, kid, heard about your old man.
I'm sorry for your loss.

431
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,809
I'm looking for Vito.
He came by my house earlier.

432
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,814
Well, he ain't here.
But pull up a chair. We'll deal you in.

433
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,566
Sonny's on a losing streak...

434
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:05,154
Did Vito have my father killed?

435
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:53,494
I never found out why Vito wasn't
at the Cucina that night.

436
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,622
Probably dumb luck.

437
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,749
But I made my point.

438
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,219
I'm gonna put the shakes in the fridge.

439
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,727
Vito skipped town and never came back.

440
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,064
He knew if he did,
he'd meet the same fate as his underlings.

441
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,114
What happened to Vito?

442
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,910
Word is, he went abroad to visit family.

443
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,080
But from now on,
you should consider me the new Vito.

444
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,959
- Hiram Lodge. Understood?
- Yeah. Works for me.

445
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:52,178
From that day forward,
I was Riverdale's new boss.

446
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,182
People paid me their dues, and soon...

447
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,602
I was moving up in the world.

448
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,272
I was the biggest fish
in a somewhat small pond.

449
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,665
- Then what happened?
- I got married, Reggie.

450
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,209
I became a father.

451
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,462
And I knew true happiness.

452
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,674
Remember when you told me
that we would move to New York together?

453
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:34,804
It's time, Hiram, to leave all this behind
and keep your promise.

454
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,891
Not only for us but for your little girl.

455
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,733
Whatever you want, mi amor.

456
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,741
So we moved to New York
and the rest is history.

457
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,411
That's one hell of a saga, Mr. Lodge.

458
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,874
But what brought you back to Riverdale?

459
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,962
Turns out that my father was correct
about the palladium.

460
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,506
He was simply looking in the wrong place.

461
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,551
I did discover a vein of palladium.

462
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,637
It was thin, but it was a sign that...

463
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,266
I would succeed
where my father had failed.

464
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,604
I built a prison over that vein,
so that behind the walls,

465
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,065
I could do whatever I wanted
and nobody could see.

466
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,649
As a smokescreen.

467
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,528
- You had your prisoners doing the digging.
- Yes.

468
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,865
But now that vein is tapped
with a disappointingly small yield.

469
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:43,164
So I need to get to the one that I found
under the Blossom maple groves.

470
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,247
If I fail...

471
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:51,422
all my efforts in Riverdale, all my gains,
all my losses, will be for nothing.

472
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,260
I will not let that happen.

473
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,265
I will finish what my father began.

474
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,939
You're unstoppable, Mr. Lodge.

475
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:13,569
You started with nothing
and got everything you wanted.

476
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,530
Is that what you take away from my story?

477
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,950
You have money. Respect. A business.

478
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,203
What more could a man want?

479
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,333
I want you to drive me somewhere.

480
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,796
I'd like to visit an old friend
in a nursing home.

481
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,548
Mind if I ask who?

482
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,215
Not at all.

483
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,969
Vittorio Alto.

484
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,014
The man who murdered my father.

485
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,746
Hello, Vito.

486
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,669
It's me, Hiram Lodge.

487
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,257
Son of Javier Luna.

488
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,684
It's taken me years to find you...

489
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,937
but my luck finally turned.

490
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,608
Do you remember when we first met?

491
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,030
I said I wanted to be feared like you?

492
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,115
Yeah.

493
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,703
You tell me, Vito, at this very moment...

494
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,124
you afraid of me?

495
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,268
Adiós, Vito.

496
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,827
Reggie, I wanna thank you
for your help and your discretion tonight.

497
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,665
I won't be needing you any longer.

498
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,168
- For the rest of the night?
- No.

499
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,882
You're done, Reggie.
I no longer require your services.

500
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:43,302
Mr. Lodge, hold on, I want this.

501
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,888
I want what you have.

502
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,807
Yeah, you don't see it, Reggie.

503
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,353
But from where I'm at...

504
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,856
if I could go back...

505
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,612
spend a few more years
shining shoes with my dad...

506
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,617
I'd do that in a heartbeat.

507
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,452
But I can't go back to that car lot.

508
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:15,793
I left so I could prove to my father
what I can do, who I can be.

509
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,004
Just give him one more chance.

510
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,089
Or not.

511
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,635
But your debt is paid.

512
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,056
I'm giving you an out, Reggie.

513
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,560
Do not insult me, and accept it.

514
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,531
What are you still doing here?

515
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,785
Why aren't you home?

516
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,418
I'm sorry, Reg.

517
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,630
I'm ashamed.

518
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,053
I've never done right by you.

519
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,637
Not ever.

520
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,063
But I wanna start, son.

521
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,565
Your timing's good, Dad.

522
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,944
I'm done with Mr. Lodge.

523
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,780
Thank God.

524
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,742
- If you're serious about your offer...
- I am.

525
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,203
Then you gotta let me run
with the ball a little bit.

526
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,831
Trust that I can take care of things.

527
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,501
Listen to my ideas.

528
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,170
I have good ideas sometimes.

529
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,466
If you can do that, then we can try.

530
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,717
One more time.

531
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,011
How does that sound?

532
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,520
Mantle and Son?

533
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,902
It's okay, Dad.

534
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,570
It's okay.

535
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,157
I cannot believe Dorinda.

536
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,368
When I told her
I was coming back to Riverdale,

537
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:16,580
she referred to it as my ex-husband's
"crime-infested hellhole."

538
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,875
Which is accurate but it still
makes you want to strangle her.

539
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,545
Mom,
can't we just have a nice lunch?

540
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:26,841
I invited you here to see the renovation,
not trash-talk the people on your show.

541
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,884
Come on, it's reality television.

542
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,929
What do you think we do,
bring each other cups of sugar?

543
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,809
How's your father? Have you seen him?

544
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,102
Oh, you know.

545
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,939
- Only when he wants to cause trouble.
- Which is always.

546
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,858
- You know what his problem is?
- What?

547
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,110
He's never satisfied by what he has.

548
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,694
Never.

549
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,738
He will never be happy.

550
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,326
Sadly, that tracks.

551
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,456
He should've retired
when he had the chance.

552
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,291
Seven years ago. Remember?

553
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,042
Please, he would sooner die.

554
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,170
Was he ever even
really sick back...?

555
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,222
Hermosita...

556
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,057
it's done.

557
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:23,689
I don't know how you found Vito,
but your grandfather has been avenged.

558
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:27,568
A bullet to the head.
I saw it when I went to do cleanup.

559
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:31,614
- Did you find any security cameras?
- Yes. They've been wiped clean.

560
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,408
Good. Very good.

561
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,913
I've sacrificed so much to get this far,
I can't stumble now.

562
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:47,087
And when I've mined
all the palladium that eluded my father...

563
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,678
I'll get back everything else
I've lost too.
