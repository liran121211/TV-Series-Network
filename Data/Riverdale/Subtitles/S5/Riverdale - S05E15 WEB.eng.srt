1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,261
Our story is about a town...

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,304
No, scratch that.

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,057
Our story is about three young women,

4
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,059
bursting with talent.

5
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,437
They were the best of friends until,

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,522
sadly, they weren't.

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,775
Our story is about how they parted ways,

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,778
found their own unique voices,

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,072
and then rediscovered each other.

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,949
But not without some drama.

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:37,662
Okay, I would like to make a toast.

12
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,458
To my roommate and my best friend,

13
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,293
Melody Valentine,

14
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,920
who, against all odds, left law school

15
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:51,509
in order to, uh, write and publish
her very first novel, Summer Storm.

16
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,636
I'm so proud of you.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,805
You fearlessly chased your dream.

18
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,099
And you're a badass for it.

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:00:59,893
I love you.

20
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,187
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,813
Cheers.

22
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,191
Cheers.

23
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,151
Thank you, Val.

24
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,071
I love you. I love you so much.

25
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,158
As my best friend mentioned,

26
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,910
I was gonna be a lawyer.

27
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,288
But when I started looking for my voice,

28
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:24,542
I knew I wasn't gonna find it
inside of Harvard's Law Library.

29
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,086
It was inside of me,

30
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,506
in the form of this book.

31
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,968
I just... I guess I just had
to be brave enough to listen to it.

32
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,931
And it's not just gonna be a book.

33
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,642
Tell everyone the good news, babe.

34
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,771
Okay, well, uh,
it's not "official" official,

35
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,689
but my book's been optioned.

36
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,899
By Tyler Perry.

37
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,901
And it's gonna be a movie,

38
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,822
and the best part is...

39
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,698
Well, I'm really excited

40
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,493
because it looks
like Valerie's gonna play the lead.

41
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,410
Yeah!

42
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,163
Yes!

43
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,666
Cheers to that.

44
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,209
Cheers to that.

45
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,672
That was such a fun party,
my love.

46
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,591
I'm so glad we celebrated you.

47
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,843
Me too, baby.

48
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,179
I do wish you didn't bring up
the whole movie thing.

49
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,639
And why is that?

50
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,185
Tyler wants a big star to play the lead.

51
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,732
Someone splashy,
like Keke Palmer or Amandla Stenberg.

52
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,317
Not Val.

53
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,111
No.

54
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,407
Not if we want the movie
to get made, he says.

55
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,165
- That was a fun night.
- It was amazing.

56
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,250
I'm so proud of Melody.

57
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,877
She's like a real adult.

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,712
You, too, movie star.

59
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,131
We're not there yet.

60
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,757
I'm still a barista.

61
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,844
Oh, please.
Hey, you're so much more than that.

62
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,346
You are a poet. An actress.

63
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,681
An activist.

64
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,726
- The love of my life.
- Alan, you're making me blush.

65
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,313
Speaking of...

66
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,817
I know you said you needed some time
to think it over, but...

67
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,446
I was wondering
if maybe you have an answer for me.

68
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,490
Yeah, I have been thinking, I promise.

69
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,576
But I'm still unsure.

70
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,579
Getting married is such a big step.

71
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,708
Okay, well, no pressure.
Because I'm fine either way.

72
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,544
Just let me know when you decide.

73
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,462
I will.

74
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:39,052
And until then,
just know that I love you, Alan Mayberry.

75
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,929
No matter what.

76
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,472
I love you too, Val.

77
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,564
That was "Kiss My Hand,"
the latest number-one single

78
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,734
from the multi-platinum
recording artist Josie McCoy.

79
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,154
Even as the mystery surrounding
the superstar's whereabouts continues

80
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,199
after failing
to appear on-stage this weekend in Berlin.

81
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,742
The world wants to know:

82
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,077
What happened?

83
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,120
Where did Josie vanish to?

84
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,207
Excuse me, uh,
I'd like to place an order to go.

85
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,834
Double cheeseburger,
cheese fries, and a chocolate shake.

86
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,421
Wait, where's Pop Tate?

87
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,967
Oh, that's my grandpa. He retired.

88
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,264
Oh, my God, are you...?

89
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,932
Are you Josie?

90
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,935
Are you the Josie McCoy?

91
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,521
In the flesh and the faux fur.

92
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,775
Unbelievable. Josie McCoy in my diner.

93
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,443
This is such an honor.

94
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,780
At the risk of fangirl-ing even more
than I already am, I...

95
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,322
I have to ask.

96
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,867
What brought you to Riverdale?

97
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,746
Just needed
to take a little break for a while.

98
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,917
You know, some me time,
to recenter myself and to write.

99
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:57,297
Well, what's it like being back?
Is...? Is it how you remember?

100
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,381
I thought I told the front desk,
no autographs.

101
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,508
I am so sorry, Ms. Newmar,

102
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,010
but hotel policy,

103
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,221
no live music in our rooms after 9 p.m.

104
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,973
There have been complaints.

105
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:58,060
Damn, Mr. Lodge,
nice to know you're still a little bitch.

106
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,773
Excuse me? What makes you think
you can speak to me that way?

107
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,942
Uh, well, for starters,

108
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,195
you're here in your jammies,

109
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,655
whining that my music's too loud.

110
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,785
To me that screams, once a little bitch,
always a little bitch.

111
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,372
Move him
if he's got a problem with my music.

112
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,792
- Excellent idea, Ms. Newmar...
- Just turn it down.

113
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,096
Veronica, do you have a minute?

114
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,517
For you, Tabitha, I've got five.

115
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:45,066
So I just had an encounter
with someone who really inspires me.

116
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,651
I won't say who, but...

117
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,112
She reminded me
of why I came to Riverdale.

118
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:54,075
My dream, my ambition,
which is to franchise Pop's.

119
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,369
But to do that, I need more capital.

120
00:08:56,452 --> 00:09:00,581
So I thought maybe
I could give you my nest egg to invest?

121
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,043
Right now probably isn't the best time.

122
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,419
Why's that?

123
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,339
Chad pulled me into financial quicksand.

124
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,176
A Ponzi scheme I'm trying
to dig myself out of by trading again,

125
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,512
but it'll be months before I can cover

126
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,265
what Chad stole
from his clients in our name.

127
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,310
And should
any of our investors start pulling out,

128
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,230
the whole house of cards
comes crashing down.

129
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,231
Got it.

130
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,649
Enough said.

131
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,569
Good luck to you.

132
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,653
Thanks.

133
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,115
Waldo, look who's visiting.

134
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,867
Ms. McCoy!

135
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,037
As fabulous as ever!

136
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,373
Aw. Thanks, Mr. Weatherbee.

137
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,126
What brings a star like you
back to our humble halls?

138
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,295
Yeah, inquiring minds wanna know.

139
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,841
Actually, I have a favor to ask.
I'm here to do some songwriting.

140
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,177
I was wondering
if I could use the music room to record.

141
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,430
Of course, I'd pay top dollar.

142
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,098
Just name your price.

143
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,477
Can your payment be teaching
a music class at Riverdale High?

144
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,480
It hasn't been
the easiest year for our students.

145
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,733
For you guys, I'll happily do it.

146
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,110
That's fantastic news.

147
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,321
They'll be so excited.

148
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,117
Smithers, what's going on?

149
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,872
Uh... send her in.

150
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,547
Alexandra Cabot.
What are you doing in Riverdale?

151
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,841
Veronica Lodge.

152
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,177
Well, I could ask the same thing.

153
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,766
But I'm here about some investments
that I made with your squirrely husband.

154
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,852
I've been calling Chad, but he's MIA,

155
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,688
so I made a day trip to pull my money out.

156
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,901
I'm feeling fiscally antsy, you see.

157
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,694
Of course.

158
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:59,075
And I could absolutely give you
the money back right now.

159
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,785
- Or...
- Or?

160
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:06,999
Well, I just stumbled across
this new investment opportunity

161
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,795
that I'm extremely,
extremely excited about.

162
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,421
Out of curiosity,

163
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,591
how do you feel about diners?

164
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,468
Tell me more.

165
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:33,983
No way.

166
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,761
- Yeah!
- Really, really good.

167
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,306
Oh, my gosh.

168
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,475
Archie Andrews.

169
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,644
Josie. I knew it was you.

170
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,273
Oh, hi.

171
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,946
And now I'm back in Riverdale
to work on this new album.

172
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,033
You should come to the Whyte Wyrm tonight,
formerly the speakeasy.

173
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,743
Everyone would love to see you.

174
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,663
I actually, uh, have
some songwriting I need to do.

175
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,332
Just for a drink or two.
It's been seven years.

176
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,543
Yeah, something like that.

177
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
Okay.

178
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,592
Can I meet you there?
I have some phone calls to make.

179
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,011
Give you two guesses
who Josie calls.

180
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,935
I freaked and sent her to voicemail.

181
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,146
At which point,

182
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,732
a phone
in the living room started to ring.

183
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,651
Hey, Josie.

184
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,735
What's up?

185
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:04,492
No, we even made
this sexy firemen's calendar

186
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,412
to raise money for the fire station,
but, anyway, enough about me.

187
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:13,042
- What about you, Josie?
- Well, it's been a whirlwind.

188
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,128
Oh, don't worry, Josie,
I've kept them all apprised,

189
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,714
from your special
on Entertainment Tomorrow

190
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,466
to your Vanity Flair cover.

191
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,761
It's so great that you're here.
You can help us save Riverdale.

192
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,640
We've been needing a face,
a celebrity to help get people excited.

193
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,517
Give her a minute. She just got here.

194
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,770
Oh, we should do a benefit concert.

195
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,147
That would be so much fun,
just like old times.

196
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,732
Old times?

197
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,817
I don't mean to offend you, Veronica,

198
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,112
but I didn't have
much of a say in our old times.

199
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,698
And now we're more acquaintances
than friends.

200
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,783
Yikes.

201
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,826
Oh, Jughead, the last time I saw you,

202
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,288
you were robbing Pop Tate's
at gunpoint in a Serpents mask.

203
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,706
Everybody on the ground!

204
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,291
- No.
- Get down!

205
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,419
- Uh...
- That was so many years ago.

206
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:02,132
Uh-uh. Betty, you and I have spoken
all of, what, one time in high school?

207
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,093
If I could jump in for a moment,

208
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,346
none of you deserve to be in the presence
of such musical greatness.

209
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,640
Cheryl, you once sent me a pig's heart.

210
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,189
Something that still haunts me,
so jump down off that soapbox, shall we?

211
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,819
I came to Riverdale to make an album,

212
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,823
not to cause trouble,
so if you'll kindly excuse me...

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,084
Josie McCoy?

214
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,422
- Sweet Pea?
- What are you doing at Pop's?

215
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,008
Leaving.

216
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,134
You want a ride?

217
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,263
Wherever you're going?

218
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,791
Sneaking out of your own hotel room?

219
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,084
Sweet Pea.

220
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,962
Last night was exactly what I needed.

221
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,300
But I've got things to do
and people to meet.

222
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,426
Of course.

223
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,470
You're a busy star.

224
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,648
Bye, stud.

225
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,114
Val, Mel,
thank you so much for meeting me.

226
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,408
How have you both been doing?
What are you doing?

227
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,161
I've been doing a lot of art

228
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,580
and getting into political activism.

229
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,959
Val's gonna save the world
one peaceful protest at a time.

230
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,627
That's really amazing, Val.

231
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,836
How about you, Melody?

232
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,385
I stay busy. I'm a YA novelist.
I just had my first book published.

233
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,222
I heard something about that.
Tyler Perry's producing a movie of it?

234
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,016
- It's, um, starring...
- What about you, Josie?

235
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,227
What brings you to Riverdale?

236
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,649
I needed a break from my tour.

237
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,527
Thought I'd finally write
about my hometown.

238
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,824
And since you guys were
a big part of my experience here,

239
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,370
I'd love to have you join me
on one of the tracks.

240
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,164
I don't know
if either of you do any performing still.

241
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,737
Nice!

242
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,665
Yeah, we still do a bit
of performing on the side.

243
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,084
- Music was my first love, so...
- Mine too.

244
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,546
Which is why it was so hard
when you just disappeared on us.

245
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,298
I know. I know I did.

246
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,384
But when I got the opportunity
to tour with my dad...

247
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,845
We're not talking about that, Josie.

248
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,014
We're talking about before you left town.

249
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,559
You stopped calling us.
We stopped hanging out, playing gigs.

250
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:32,272
- We thought we'd done something wrong.
- The irony is that your dad was like us.

251
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,356
A sideman.

252
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,862
You'd think you of all people
would've respected your sidewomen more.

253
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,615
I'm sorry.

254
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:43,742
Truly, I am.

255
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,496
I know the value of what you both did
and what you brought to the table.

256
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:53,085
I understand if you don't wanna record
this song, but it's an open offer.

257
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,045
We'll think about it.

258
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,424
But either way,
it was good catching up with you, Josie.

259
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,136
I like to think of myself as a connector.

260
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,431
My friend, Tabitha Tate, wants
to franchise her family's diner.

261
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:10,394
My other friend, Alexandra Cabot,
is always looking for a smart investment.

262
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:14,147
Tabitha, why don't you tell Xandra
what you told me last night?

263
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,192
I believe
that America is ready for a new start.

264
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,654
The face of that new start
should be Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

265
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,739
Small-town feel, even in big cities.

266
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,702
Look through our packet.
It details our expansion strategies.

267
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,705
No need. I've already made my decision.

268
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,166
I love diners,
and I'm feeling your homespun vision.

269
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,336
But may I suggest a tweak or two?

270
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,922
What kind of tweaks?

271
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,340
You may not know this,

272
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,427
but I am a performer
as well as a businesswoman,

273
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,098
and I've always
romanticized singing diners.

274
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,935
We have a proud tradition
of singing here at Pop's.

275
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,605
Singing is something
we can definitely talk about.

276
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,650
Yeah, talking isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

277
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,021
Well, I always say, going out for a meal
isn't just about the food,

278
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,689
it's about the experience.

279
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,526
Singing clearly enhances
the Pop's experience.

280
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,027
Agreed.

281
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,823
Toni, thank you so much
for jumping in on such short notice.

282
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:31,535
Also, what, pray tell, is in that bag?

283
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:35,622
The most adorable baby jeans
from Old Navy you've ever seen.

284
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,916
Thanks for asking me.

285
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,336
I thought it would induce labor.
But no such luck.

286
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
- Bye.
- Bye.

287
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:48,176
So, Xandra, do we have a deal?

288
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,344
Almost.

289
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:53,014
The creative is there, but now I need
to see your books and finances.

290
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:57,144
Everything from the last 20 years.

291
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,562
Sure.

292
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,315
I can make that happen.

293
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,325
Mom.

294
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,628
What are you doing in Riverdale?

295
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,673
How did you even know?

296
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,092
A mother always knows.

297
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,346
When I heard you had disappeared,

298
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,893
I had a hunch
you might find your way to Riverdale.

299
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,686
Ms. Newmar.

300
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,441
What happened, Josie?

301
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,036
When I got your call
with the news about Dad, I was in Berlin.

302
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:03,543
Seconds from stepping onto a stage
in a stadium filled with 80,000 people.

303
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,964
Mom? What's going on?

304
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,842
I just got word.

305
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,802
Your dad passed away, baby.

306
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,015
It was sudden. A heart attack.

307
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,602
Oh, my God. Mom.

308
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,774
I'm in Berlin,
in the middle of a world tour.

309
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,444
I know, and that's why I don't want you
to worry about anything.

310
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,363
We'll meet up right after.

311
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,823
It'll go by in a flash.

312
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,461
After that call, I...

313
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,256
I couldn't perform.

314
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:53,009
I just turned around
and walked away from everything.

315
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,803
And you came to Riverdale.

316
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,515
I haven't been back in years.

317
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,977
Just thought I could disappear here.

318
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,522
Like in high school.

319
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,106
Josie, I...

320
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,319
I brought your father's ashes.

321
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:17,075
His last request was
that they be scattered around the country.

322
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,995
All the little spots he toured and loved.

323
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,580
Sounds about right.

324
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,583
And that's not all.

325
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,881
Some songs he wrote or reorchestrated,

326
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,009
but never got a chance to record.

327
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,778
Val? Hey.

328
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,031
Do you have a minute to talk?

329
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,116
Sure, Mel. What's up?

330
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,787
Well, I've been thinking a lot about Josie

331
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,290
and how she didn't do right by us.

332
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,377
And how I wanna do right by you, Valerie.

333
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,671
But that means being honest
with each other.

334
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:17,302
I don't think we'll be making Summer Storm
into a movie anytime soon.

335
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,763
What happened?

336
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,140
Tyler Perry wants a star to play the lead.

337
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,724
That...

338
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,477
I mean, that makes sense.

339
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,439
If it means your movie gets made,
I wouldn't wanna hold you back.

340
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,941
I told him no.

341
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,319
What do you mean, no?

342
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,821
I just sent Tyler an e-mail that said.

343
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:41,409
I wasn't interested
in making Summer Storm into a movie...

344
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,745
unless it starred you.

345
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,123
Val, that role is yours.

346
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,168
We'll get it done, Valerie.

347
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,170
The two of us together.

348
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,253
The right way.

349
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,969
Is that Josie again?

350
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,221
It's her mom.

351
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,642
Well, I've dug through your books,

352
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:09,479
and, uh, first off,
we literally need to reprice everything.

353
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,942
I think bringing prices up to date
is totally doable, right?

354
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,195
- Yeah.
- And then there's the milkshake.

355
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,114
Oh, it's divinity in a glass.

356
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,074
You're losing money on them.

357
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,243
However, if we adjust the recipe

358
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:27,789
to replace real milk with instant milk,
we can save a ton of money.

359
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,291
Pop's milkshakes are
our signature product,

360
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,127
developed by my great-great-grandfather.

361
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,753
I can't change the recipe.

362
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,797
Girl, relax. It is just a milkshake.

363
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,802
Alexandra, you may not know this,

364
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,848
but Pop started off selling one thing,
chocolate milkshakes,

365
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,100
hence the name Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

366
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:51,688
That was back when this was the first
and only Black-owned business in town.

367
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,897
It was open 24/7,

368
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:57,318
a safe place for people like us
when those were few and far between.

369
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:01,948
So, no, it's not just a milkshake,
and this isn't just a business.

370
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,158
It's a legacy.

371
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,119
I can't give that up for a bottom line.

372
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,292
This doesn't feel right anymore. Sorry.

373
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,922
Well, Veronica,
I'm assuming you're prepared for me

374
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,425
to withdraw my money
from your portfolios ASAP.

375
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,177
If that's what you wanna do.

376
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,931
But the banks are closed,
so you'll have to wait until tomorrow.

377
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,142
See you bright and early.

378
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,189
Thought you'd be here.

379
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,943
What are you doing here?

380
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,612
Your mom called us.

381
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:44,532
We're so sorry about your dad, Josie.
Why didn't you tell us?

382
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:48,995
If we'd known, Josie, we would have
never said any of those things to you.

383
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,955
It's okay, Mel.

384
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,668
You both were 100% right.

385
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,297
You know,

386
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,593
sometimes I think

387
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:09,140
watching my dad spend his entire career
just outside of the spotlight

388
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,519
is why I became so obsessed

389
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,354
with getting it for myself.

390
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,609
But now I would give anything

391
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,154
to play with him just one more time.

392
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,326
With you guys one more time.

393
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,746
Then let's do it, Josie.

394
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,123
That's why we came.

395
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,419
To tell you, if you still wanna record
that song together,

396
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,255
we're totally down.

397
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,260
Oh, my gosh, that's...

398
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,594
That's amazing.

399
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,430
- What?
- What?

400
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,558
Nothing, nothing. I just...

401
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:55,436
How would you feel about playing
a one-night-only concert?

402
00:30:56,896 --> 00:31:01,526
That would be incredible, Josie,
but what's the occasion?

403
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,112
You guys giving me another shot

404
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:08,074
makes me think that maybe
some other people might deserve one too.

405
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,412
Josie, Melody, and Valerie.

406
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,248
I feel like I'm
in sophomore year again.

407
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,791
What's going on?

408
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,459
- Hi, Archie.
- Hey, Archie.

409
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,296
We're gonna help you
and the gang save Riverdale.

410
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,298
Are you sure? You didn't exactly...

411
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,632
Please.

412
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,803
When a superstar offers to help,
you don't try to talk them out of it.

413
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,597
What are you thinking?

414
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,849
Well, we're thinking,

415
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:37,186
a one-night-only Josie and the Pussycats
reunion concert at the Whyte Wyrm.

416
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,023
With proceeds going
to a fund to reincorporate

417
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,567
the former town of Riverdale.

418
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,611
Josie and the Pussycats reunited.

419
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,616
If that doesn't save Riverdale,
nothing will.

420
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,790
Toni, how overdue are you?

421
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,042
A week.

422
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:02,045
I thought it'd be good
for the baby to see the Cats live.

423
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,880
Plus, I wouldn't miss this.

424
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,550
Dr. Curdle Junior? Hey.

425
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,302
Did someone die?

426
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,970
No, Ms. Cooper.

427
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,306
- I'm a huge Josie fan.
- We both are.

428
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,324
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

429
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,578
Let's give it up
for Valerie Brown and Melody Valentine.

430
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,208
Listen.

431
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,168
I've played a lot of venues.

432
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,337
The Sydney Opera House,

433
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,713
Dodger Stadium,

434
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,758
the Apollo.

435
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:58,304
But there is no better spot
to play music than here.

436
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:03,601
Riverdale nourishes artists
like myself and Valerie and Melody.

437
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,563
And, heck, even Jughead Jones.

438
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:16,739
So this next song is something
my dad wanted to hear me perform.

439
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:22,662
It's originally sung by one
of his favorite artists, Nina Simone.

440
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,413
This is for him.

441
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,996
- Toni?
- I'm sorry. I think I'm having my baby.

442
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,165
Oh, crap.

443
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,919
Um... Okay.
Is there a doctor in the house?

444
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,963
- I'm a doctor.
- I can do it.

445
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,341
We prepared for a home birth.
I need another pair of hands.

446
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,300
I'll do it.

447
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,345
- Let's go, go, go.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

448
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,895
As exciting as a random birth
in the back of a diner is,

449
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:57,275
not to mention the coincidence
of crossing paths with Josie in Riverdale,

450
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:01,946
my mind naturally turns back
to business, as always.

451
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,866
- Oh, really?
- Josie's little speech got me thinking.

452
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,536
With her celebrity endorsement of Pop's,

453
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,832
a franchise seems like
an even more lucrative prospect.

454
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,085
We're not changing the milkshake recipe.

455
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,587
Pop's original milkshake recipe and all.

456
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,882
Typical Riverdale.

457
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,593
The Pussycats always getting upstaged
by something.

458
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,847
Better a new baby than a dead body.

459
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,309
Still, it felt pretty great
performing together again, didn't it?

460
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,311
Agreed.

461
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,981
Well, would you ladies
ever consider going on tour with me?

462
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,025
I wanna drive around the country

463
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,737
and visit all
the small cool places my dad played,

464
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,238
to honor his final wish.

465
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,824
What do you say?

466
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,284
Intriguing.

467
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,704
But wait. Would we be like
your opening act or something?

468
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,789
No, all three of us would be headlining.

469
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,124
I can't believe this.

470
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:56,958
I mean...

471
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,587
I have to talk to Alan,

472
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,632
about a lot of things, including the fact
that I'm not ready to get married.

473
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,634
- Wait, what?
- I'll fill you in later.

474
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,722
But, Josie, I'm in.

475
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,058
Yes, yes!

476
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,144
Melody?

477
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:20,649
God, I mean, I...
I have to talk to Nancy about it.

478
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,945
But now that my movie's on the backburner,
I guess it could be like a book tour?

479
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,864
Absolutely.

480
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,908
- Are we doing this?
- Yes.

481
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,409
- Okay.
- Yes.

482
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,583
- Well?
- It's a boy.

483
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,756
Finally some good news in this crazy town.

484
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,763
Not gonna lie, Josie.

485
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,891
We were hoping you'd stay
and be Riverdale High's new music teacher.

486
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,644
Ha. Uh, my destiny lies elsewhere.

487
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,396
Have an amazing tour, Josie.

488
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,980
I'm gonna call you, okay?

489
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,316
I'm gonna live vicariously through you.

490
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,820
Deal. But you guys should come out
and see me sometime.

491
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,530
We will 100%, Josie.

492
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,865
Especially if we can get backstage passes?

493
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,534
Uh, hell, yes, you can.

494
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,120
Look who came to say bye.

495
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,872
Oh, my God.

496
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,709
What is this cutie patootie's name?

497
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:21,793
Tony.

498
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,755
Anthony, after my grandfather.

499
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:29,718
Congratulations again, Toni, Fangs, Kevin.

500
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,637
He's really beautiful.

501
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,060
You know, Alan,
you don't have to come with us.

502
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,645
I still love you, Val.

503
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,065
I'm in it for the long haul,
married or not.

504
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,693
In case I haven't told you today,

505
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,988
I'm crazy about you, Alan Mayberry.

506
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,573
See?

507
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,451
Plenty of time.

508
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,414
I don't know how I'm gonna handle
being on the road without you, Nance.

509
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,498
You'll be fine.

510
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,750
We'll check in every night.

511
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,420
I know. I just...

512
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,924
It's not gonna be the same, you know?

513
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,512
Hey, Josie.

514
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,556
Hi.

515
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,892
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh, yeah.

516
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,647
So I've been thinking, and, uh...

517
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,776
Is there any chance
that I can tag along with you?

518
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,321
I'd pull my weight. I could...

519
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,282
I could drive the bus,
or I could be your roadie.

520
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,909
I could be your...

521
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,204
I could be your anything.

522
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,543
It'll be a tight squeeze, but yes.

523
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,296
Great. I'll, uh... I'll load my stuff.

524
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,468
- You almost ready, honey?
- I think so.

525
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,637
Unless this town has
any more surprises for me.

526
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,804
Josie McCoy.

527
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,473
Yes?

528
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,185
My name is Toots Sweet. I am a musician
who toured with your father.

529
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,354
We've always had each other's backs.

530
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,980
That's why I'm here.

531
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,360
I was with Myles
in New Orleans before he passed.

532
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,071
He was mixed in bad stuff.

533
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,866
Debts, petty crimes, even voodoo.

534
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,454
I don't believe
your father died of natural causes.

535
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,499
Are you saying
that my father was murdered?

536
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,918
I'm sorry. This must come as a shock.

537
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,754
Mr. Sweet,
we've lived long enough in Riverdale

538
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:33,050
to know that when someone passes away,
foul play is always on the table.

539
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,432
I know where the first stop
of my tour's gonna be.

540
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,600
New Orleans.

541
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,977
It is.

542
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,605
Let's get out of here
before we run out of room on the bus.

543
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,543
And there you have it.

544
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,045
The story of three young women,

545
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,173
old friends who found
their way back to each other

546
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:18,387
and who set off together towards magical,
musical mysteries unknown.

547
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,891
- We love you guys!
- We love you!

548
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:27,313
Do yourself a favor
and remember our names, all three of them:

549
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:32,151
Josie McCoy,
Valerie Brown, and Melody Valentine.

550
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,070
'Cause you'll be hearing from us again.
