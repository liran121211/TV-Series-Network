1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,219
Portrait of a town in flames.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,557
Thanks to a fire extinguisher
Mr. Andrews kept stored in the hall closet

3
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,393
and another one under the kitchen sink,

4
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:23,356
what could have been a suburban inferno
was, instead, merely the latest indication

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,901
of how far the now non-existent
town of Riverdale had fallen.

6
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:31,281
An arsonist on the loose,
and no firemen to battle the fires.

7
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,364
Archie.

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,370
You see this guy in the front?

9
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,955
That is my Grandpa Artie.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,790
He was a fireman back in the day.

11
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,168
Oh, jeez,
I think I know where this is going.

12
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,371
The best counterattack
is not to fight fire with fire,

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,547
but to fight fire with a fire department.

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,133
What, no mano a mano with Hiram Lodge?

15
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,926
I called Ronnie. She's gonna talk to him.

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,429
Oh, Ronnie is. That's interesting.

17
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,638
You see this rookie?

18
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,974
He ended up becoming
Riverdale's fire chief for 20 years.

19
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,435
He's retired now,
but he still lives in Riverdale.

20
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,145
Well, go get him, soldier.

21
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,108
I'm hoping we already know
the answer, Dr. Curdle Junior, but...

22
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,196
is this my sister's body?

23
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,281
Your sister's been missing for a week.

24
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,493
These remains have been in Swedlow Swamp

25
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,453
for approximately three years.

26
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,247
The bog preserved her.

27
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,083
Well, do you have a cause of death yet?

28
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,377
At first blush,
blunt-force trauma to the head.

29
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,048
What happens to the body now? To... To her?

30
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:34,135
Without identification, she'll be sent
to the crematorium for disposal.

31
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,306
Dr. Curdle, will you just wait a beat
while I do some digging for her identity?

32
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,265
Of course.

33
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,029
All right. I'm going back
to Swedlow Swamp.

34
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,478
Polly, or at least her phone,
is still out there.

35
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,149
Daddy. Someone set fire
to Archie's house last night

36
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,276
and this attack
has your fingerprints all over it.

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,363
Why would I wanna burn down
the Andrews family home?

38
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,281
The rash of arson cases around town

39
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,993
is meant to drive
any remaining long-term residents away

40
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,038
so your precious SoDale
becomes the only game in town.

41
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,289
Am I getting warm, Daddy?

42
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,667
Riverdale can't be saved.

43
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,919
Your high school is a joke.

44
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,840
Heck, you haven't had garbage pickups
in months. The place smells like a corpse.

45
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,216
It's not coming back to life.

46
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,843
We'll see about that, Daddy.

47
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,928
This just became personal.

48
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,894
Wow. Was I ever that young?

49
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,813
Feels like a lifetime ago.

50
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,815
It doesn't have to be, Chief Russell.

51
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,608
I mean, you could come out of retirement.

52
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,027
This town needs a fire department.

53
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,530
Hiram Lodge
didn't just shut down the department,

54
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,532
he firebombed the firehouse.

55
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,950
Then we'll operate out of my gym.

56
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,993
And I'll be the first volunteer,
following in my Grandpa Artie's footsteps.

57
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,831
It was an honor
working with your grandpa, Archie.

58
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,417
But this is a young man's battle.

59
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,239
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Miss Winchester herself.

60
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,949
Come for another surprise visit, Cheryl?

61
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,826
Thank you for taking care
of the River Vixens

62
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,244
whilst I was self-isolating,

63
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,747
but, as Elton John likes to say:

64
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,540
"The bitch is back in town."

65
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,125
And this squad is my birthright.

66
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,294
Wrong. The Vixens are mine now, hon.

67
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,921
I restarted them,

68
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,380
I'm financing them,

69
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,174
and we've been doing all the work.

70
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,218
So, what are you gonna do about that?

71
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,221
What every Vixen throughout history
has done to settle a dispute:

72
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,182
- Challenge you to a dance-off.
- I'm pregnant.

73
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,852
- Does that mean you forfeit?
- I'll dance for Miss Topaz.

74
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,187
As her proxy.

75
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,442
You know, I usually have a rule
about annihilating high school students,

76
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,737
but you seem particularly insufferable.

77
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,220
Now, let's decide this.

78
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,640
All those in favor of moi as your HBIC?

79
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,730
And all those for me?

80
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,985
A tie.

81
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,405
In that case, I'd be willing
to share control of the Vixens...

82
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,615
if your ego could handle that.

83
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,035
Agreed. For now.

84
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,166
Why are you buffoons just standing there?
Take it from the top!

85
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,257
Well, I spoke with my father,
and, of course, he denies

86
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,427
having anything to do
with setting your porch on fire, Archie.

87
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,264
Figures. And I spoke
to the old fire chief,

88
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,308
and he won't help.

89
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:56,105
So, now I have no fire engine,
no volunteers, and no one to train them.

90
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,109
I could maybe help with that.

91
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,528
My best friend Katy Keene's
roommate, Jorge,

92
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,406
his ex-boyfriend
is an actual New York firefighter.

93
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,867
Let me see if I can get him
out here for a day or two.

94
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,827
Ronnie, that would be amazing. Thank you.

95
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,538
In the meantime,
after my tête-à-tête with dear old Daddy,

96
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,208
I came up with a crazy idea

97
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,127
to bolster Riverdale's struggling economy.

98
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,211
Listen up, guys.

99
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:22,924
This week, you're going to learn
how to revive a dying economy.

100
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,801
Namely, ours.

101
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,053
Step one, create jobs.

102
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:31,599
Who wants to renovate a seedy video store
and turn it into a jewelry shop?

103
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,476
And be exempt from the midterm exam?

104
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,320
Tabitha. Check this out.
Spent the afternoon at the library.

105
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,031
Found an article
about Old Man Dreyfuss and his crew.

106
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,201
"Four of the five miners
detailed an encounter

107
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:53,788
with the frightening humanoid creature
they described as a Mothman."

108
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,997
Well, he wasn't lying.

109
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,583
Or he was lying to you now
and they were lying back then.

110
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,502
Except I kept looking for more articles

111
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,463
and I found that one
written two months after the Mothman one.

112
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,509
"A group of residents in the town
of Riverdale were stunned late last month

113
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,345
as they watched a mysterious sight unfold.

114
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,974
Unexplained lights materializing
and hovering in the dark sky."

115
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,644
Read the last paragraph.
Do you see who's quoted as an eyewitness?

116
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,524
No way.

117
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,171
You think you can get me an interview?

118
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,827
Hey, sarge. Nice digs.

119
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,581
What? Jackson. When did you
get released from the hospital?

120
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,374
A couple of days ago.

121
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,338
I signed up
for the program the VA was offering,

122
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,919
the therapeutic housing.

123
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,379
Why? You don't need that, do you?

124
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,592
Some of us need help
transitioning to civilian life, yes.

125
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,427
I'm sorry. No, I'm happy for you.

126
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,387
Figure I'd take up your invitation
before I go.

127
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,682
Well, your timing's perfect. I'm about
to go to the bar to meet some friends.

128
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,605
Come inside,
drop your stuff off, and we'll go.

129
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,608
So, I went through all the archives
in the sheriff's office, Dr. Curdle,

130
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,371
and there was only one
missing person filed

131
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,570
in the last seven years, Margaret Harper.

132
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,032
I'm sorry, Miss Cooper,
but Margaret Harper isn't a match, either.

133
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,700
According to this police report,

134
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,453
Margaret had braces
at the time of her disappearance.

135
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,081
There's no evidence of braces
on our Jane Doe.

136
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,836
Okay. So, she's not Polly or Margaret.

137
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,505
She's a third missing girl.

138
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,758
And three's a pattern.

139
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,771
Guys, this is Eric Jackson.

140
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,524
We served together.
I trust him with my life.

141
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,027
- Eric, these are the guys.
- Nice to meet you, fellas.

142
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,695
Jackson, thank you for your service.

143
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,780
My dad served as well.

144
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,863
No greater honor.

145
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,909
So, I'm looking for a few good men.

146
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,869
Story of my life.

147
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,038
I'm hoping
to assemble a volunteer fire department

148
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,761
to replace the one Hiram Lodge disbanded.

149
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,751
Guys who aren't afraid to run
into a burning building and save lives.

150
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,088
So... I figured I'd start with you guys.

151
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,340
We don't know the first thing
about firefighting.

152
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:13,469
Except for what I learned watching
Backdraft over and over in junior high.

153
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,764
And that is why Veronica's
getting an expert from New York.

154
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,141
It's gonna be fine. Trust me.

155
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,225
So, who's with me?

156
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,899
Civilians.

157
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,444
Thank you for coming in,
Miss Harper.

158
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,322
I don't want to reopen old wounds,

159
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,118
but I was working
on another missing person's case

160
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,328
when I came across your daughter's file.

161
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,582
Margaret was... a bright girl.

162
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,376
But she fell in with the wrong crowd.

163
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,003
Were you and Margaret close?

164
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,296
Not so much.

165
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:52,216
I think she...
felt like she couldn't talk to me.

166
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,384
Once she...

167
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,345
She started going with the truckers.

168
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,892
Miss Harper, what do you believe
happened to your daughter?

169
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:02,976
I...

170
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,396
I have no idea.

171
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,858
Which, in a way, makes it so much worse.

172
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,402
Yeah. I understand.

173
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,279
Sheriff Keller did what he could.

174
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,531
But he was one man.

175
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,326
And the whole town was falling apart.

176
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,956
There was a social worker... named Toni.

177
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,375
She was a godsend.

178
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,345
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Cheryl Blossom.

179
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,556
I'd heard rumors that Queen Elsa
had come down from the mountain.

180
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,266
It was a Vixens emergency.

181
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,852
Well, how are your art skills these days?

182
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,480
Flawless as ever. Why?

183
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,357
I want you to design something for me.

184
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,568
Something that would fit
on this printing plate.

185
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:59,033
I was a Cavalry Scout
before being selected for sniper school.

186
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:03,871
By the time I graduated, I could
bull's-eye a playing card at 500 meters.

187
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,832
All right, guys.
Last question for Corporal Jackson.

188
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,626
Ask him anything.

189
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,046
What was the commander like in the Army?

190
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,129
I'll show you.

191
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,891
I got this nifty hunk of metal
from a grenade on the battlefield.

192
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,979
But if it weren't for your commander,
I'd have been sent home in a body bag.

193
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:35,194
Sergeant Andrews is the kind of man
that never stops giving back.

194
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:39,615
Hell, that's why he's trying to start
a volunteer fire department on his own.

195
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,075
Wait. Can we help with that?

196
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,398
What, with the fire department?

197
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,162
No, you got school and football.

198
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,248
Due respect, so do you, sir.

199
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,331
Damn.

200
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,752
My own friends turned me down,
and you guys are in?

201
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,796
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

202
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,923
Okay then.

203
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,885
But you have to be 16 to sign up
and you need your parents' permission.

204
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,723
What's this, Miss Lodge?

205
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,850
Prototypes.

206
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,769
The real money will be printed,
not photocopied.

207
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:15,776
So... There was a town in Oregon
on the verge of economic collapse,

208
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,778
much like our beloved Riverdale.

209
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,198
Until they started printing
their own money.

210
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:25,286
Money they could use as actual currency,
but only in their town.

211
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,621
So, it keeps getting reinvested
in the town.

212
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,749
- How does that work?
- Simple.

213
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,877
I pay you for remodeling my jewelry shop
with Riverdollars,

214
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,463
which you then funnel back
into Riverdale's economy

215
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,548
by spending it at Pop's or the Bijou.

216
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,674
And they'll accept it?

217
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,635
Yes. Which they can either redeem with me

218
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,472
or hopefully use it
to pay their own employees

219
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,098
to keep the flow going.

220
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,602
I've already sold one
of my Glamergé eggs for $50,000,

221
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,771
which will serve as collateral
for the new currency.

222
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,691
It's an investment I'm happy to make,
especially if it gets people in the habit

223
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,653
of spending more and supporting
local businesses in Riverdale.

224
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,405
Any questions?

225
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,658
Yeah. When do we get paid?

226
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,168
Mom?

227
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,880
I found Polly's phone.

228
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,383
No sign of her,
but... I found this in the swamp.

229
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,678
That means Swedlow Swamp
is exactly where we should keep looking.

230
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,932
Betty Cooper. What can I get you?

231
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,185
Toni, does the name Margaret Harper
mean anything to you?

232
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,521
Yeah. She went missing a few years ago.

233
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,357
Yeah. I've been looking for Polly,
as you know,

234
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,150
and I came across Margaret's file.

235
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,821
And I talked to her mom,
who said that you really helped her.

236
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,364
I mean, I tried to.

237
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,200
The truth is there's a lot
of Margarets in Riverdale.

238
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,994
She's just one of the few
that went missing and got reported.

239
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,247
- Yeah.
- I tried to set them up with jobs

240
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,375
or a support group,
but it's hard, you know?

241
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,459
Of course.

242
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,924
Toni... I found a body in Swedlow Swamp.

243
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,175
Oh, my God.

244
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,343
It wasn't Polly.

245
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,470
It wasn't Margaret, but...

246
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,306
my mom found Polly's phone there.

247
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,893
Something really bad
is happening... in that swamp.

248
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,062
And we need your help searching it.

249
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,398
Well, the Serpents
are at your disposal, Betty.

250
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,691
Thank you.

251
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,946
Thanks for coming
to meet with us, Pop.

252
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,825
No problem. Any excuse to visit
the Chock'lit Shoppe now that I'm retired.

253
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:33,455
So, about that article we called you for,
the one with the lights,

254
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,017
you were quoted, I was wondering
if you remember what happened.

255
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,418
Clear as day.

256
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,254
It was one night about 50 years ago.

257
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,131
It was late.

258
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:47,177
There were probably five
or six people in the diner.

259
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,680
Here you go. And here you go.

260
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,308
Two world-famous burger combos. Enjoy.

261
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:57,605
When all of a sudden, you could feel this,
I don't know, electricity in the air.

262
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,571
We all walked out
to the parking lot to take a look.

263
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,908
Then, a few minutes later...

264
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,118
the lights were gone.

265
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:57,373
And it was just a beautiful autumn night.

266
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,876
That's incredible, Grandpa.

267
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,004
- What do you think it was?
- We all had theories.

268
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,007
Some said aliens.

269
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,677
But the most credible explanation I heard

270
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,223
was that it was military testing
from an army base outside Riverdale.

271
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,058
Did it ever happen again?

272
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,518
The lights?

273
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,601
No.

274
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,729
But I'll tell you,

275
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:25,192
a part of me wished
the lights would come back.

276
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,320
I just got goose bumps.

277
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,907
You know who else was here
that night you should talk to?

278
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,701
- Who?
- Who?

279
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,369
Cheryl's grandmother.

280
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,915
- Nana Blossom.
- Yeah.

281
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,050
Welcome to day one
of Riverdale's Volunteer Fire Academy.

282
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,971
Today's our first day of training with
a real firefighter from New York City,

283
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,514
who's gonna help get us into shape.

284
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,892
Bernardo Bixby from Engine 141,
the floor is yours.

285
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,060
Thanks, Archie.

286
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,772
So, a show of hands, how many of you
have had prior experience fighting fires?

287
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,697
That's okay. We're gonna start
with the most important lesson.

288
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,825
You must work as a team.

289
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,453
No one goes into a burning building alone.

290
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,831
Now, a team is only as strong
as its weakest link.

291
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:25,252
And on my crew, there are no weak links!

292
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,414
Yeah.

293
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,313
Why's Veronica printing Monopoly money
with her face on it?

294
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,631
Relax.

295
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:15,928
You will still get your normal paycheck.
This is mad money, to spend in Riverdale.

296
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,847
Like here or at the Bijou or...

297
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,520
Whiskey. We better make that a double.

298
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,530
I've seen a porcelain doll
possessed by my deceased brother

299
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,073
move faster than you lot!

300
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,617
What the hell is this, Cheryl?

301
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,328
Vixens practice, obvi.

302
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,414
We need to be doing two-a-days
if we want to avoid public embarrassment.

303
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,058
We're supposed to be coaching together.

304
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,335
Clearly you went behind my back
and scheduled a practice.

305
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,754
Well, I knew you would cause
a scene like this, Toni. Duh.

306
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,091
- Oh...
- Vixens, call Nurse Nightingale.

307
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,884
Cheryl, this ends now.

308
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,638
Vixens, like Blossoms, are forged in fire.

309
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,057
Hmm, wow. Sounds like
something your mother would say.

310
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,476
Careful where thoust treads, Toni.

311
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,603
You're on thin ice.

312
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,652
Polly!

313
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,612
Polly!

314
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,866
Hey, Polly?

315
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,455
That's far enough!

316
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,625
Every one of you
is trespassing on private property.

317
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,878
Retreat immediately
or face the consequences.

318
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:31,961
Hiram.

319
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,256
My daughter's missing.

320
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,008
She might be somewhere in your swamp.

321
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,385
Alice, as a father, I feel your pain,

322
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,180
but I can't have people
wandering through here.

323
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,015
All of this is gonna be my new turnpike.

324
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,683
Well, it's also a crime scene.

325
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,269
Well, if it is,
it's not your jurisdiction, sheriff.

326
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:52,816
Well, I'm with the FBI, so the FBI
is declaring this a crime scene.

327
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,340
Oh, I think you're gonna need better

328
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,321
than that badge you got out
of a JackerCrack box, Betty.

329
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,157
In the meantime, off my property.

330
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,742
Now.

331
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,756
Nana Rose,
my grandfather claimed

332
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,967
that you were at the Chock'lit Shoppe
50 years ago

333
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,887
when a bright light appeared in the sky.

334
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,681
Oh, yes. I remember it well.

335
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:29,478
My suspicion is that the light came
from the Mothmen ship.

336
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,522
"The Mothmen"? Again.

337
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,691
A few weeks after the incident,

338
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:39,196
I found a hideously misshapen body

339
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,031
in the maple forest.

340
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,075
A Mothman corpse?

341
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,121
An autopsy was performed.

342
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,624
An autopsy...? Like an alien autopsy?

343
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,794
Nana Rose, why has no one heard
about this before?

344
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,964
Oh, the Mothmen
didn't want us talking about it.

345
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,174
You spoke to them?

346
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,928
Well, they came to Thornhill
looking for their missing friends.

347
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,515
They... don't like to be known.

348
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,310
And they didn't like me
keeping their deceased, either.

349
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,105
I told them it had been cremated.

350
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,856
Had it been cremated?

351
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,238
No. I kept it.

352
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:26,118
Perfectly preserved
in a barrel of maple syrup.

353
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,747
I could try to find it
for you if you like.

354
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,296
Congratulations.

355
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,091
We've successfully introduced
50,000 Riverdollars

356
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,259
into our town's economy.

357
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,095
Yeah!

358
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,638
So, what's next?

359
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,931
We pump more money in.

360
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,766
Exactly. But how much more?

361
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,935
Another thousand? Ten thousand?

362
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,020
Ten thousand!

363
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,857
Wrong. If we flood the market
with new bills, we risk inflation,

364
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,526
or triggering a run
on the bank, which is me.

365
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,404
And... since I'm the one on the hook,

366
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,574
I say we build our economy
slow and steady.

367
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,826
Very clever, mija.

368
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,536
Daddy.

369
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,205
I'm in the middle of a class.

370
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,415
I'm sorry for interrupting,

371
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,710
but I had to congratulate you
on your newest enterprise.

372
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,463
Plastering your face over currency.

373
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,467
Even at my most audacious,
that thought never occurred to me.

374
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,845
Well, it's a good thing I've never limited
myself to what you thought possible.

375
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,638
- Mm.
- Now, if you'll excuse me...

376
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,058
Oh, wait. You and Archie?

377
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,477
Printing money.

378
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,479
Starting a fire department.

379
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,897
Who does such things?

380
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,774
We believe in Riverdale.

381
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,484
And we're bringing it back.

382
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,569
Now, really, Daddy, take a hike.

383
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,366
Where were we?

384
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,953
So, then sarge over here decides

385
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,664
to try and feed this stray dog
outside the outpost.

386
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,958
Now, this dog looked more
like a wolf to me.

387
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,503
- Don't believe him. It was a dog.
- How big are we talking?

388
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,837
Oh, timber wolf-size.

389
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:01,921
Anyways.

390
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,132
Sarge pours out this MRE
out onto his hand,

391
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,926
sticks it through the fence,

392
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,595
and then the dog
almost bites his arm off, and...

393
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,889
Show them your scar, sarge.

394
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,267
Afternoon, sir.

395
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,686
How can we help you?

396
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,483
- Thought this place was shut down.
- It was. We reopened it.

397
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,777
Now it's gonna house
the new volunteer fire department.

398
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,697
- Do you live on Sketch Alley?
- I do. Name's Earl.

399
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,158
We haven't had a fire department
in a long time.

400
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,036
Lot of buildings burned down 'cause of it.

401
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,538
Well, things are changing.

402
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,624
We're gonna make this town better
for you, your friends.

403
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,126
For everyone.

404
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,752
Heard that talk before.

405
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,130
Hope you can back it up.

406
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,638
Come on, Glen. There has to be
someone you can send my way.

407
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,558
Betty, you have a Jane Doe
and two missing girls

408
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,894
with problematic histories. Look, you
gotta let the local police handle this.

409
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,272
It's one sheriff, Glen.

410
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,650
Up against a rich psychopath
who won't let us search his land.

411
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,360
- So, I'm begging you...
- Betty.

412
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,615
He's back. The Trash Bag Killer.

413
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,119
- What?
- TBK's re-emerged.

414
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,455
- In Tulsa, we think.
- How man...?

415
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,210
- Are there any victims?
- Two. So far.

416
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,255
Look, why don't you send me what you got
and I'll see what I can do.

417
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,465
No, Glen.

418
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,594
Uh... You focus on TBK.

419
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,056
Catch that bastard, okay?
I'm gonna handle everything here myself.

420
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,517
And I'll check in with you.

421
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,005
Damn it, Betty, we warned you.
You're trespassing on private property.

422
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,298
I'm not going anywhere.

423
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,967
My sister is missing.

424
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,219
Other girls, too.

425
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,013
My mom is suffering,
and it's because of your boss

426
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,807
that I'm the only person out here
who can do anything about it.

427
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,144
So, if you wanna stop me,
you'll have to shoot me.

428
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,604
Wait.

429
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,236
I found something
while patrolling the swamp.

430
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:34,282
But cone of silence,
Hiram can never know I told you.

431
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,037
Okay, you have my word. Cone of silence.

432
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,871
What is it?

433
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,166
Another body.

434
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,091
Cadet Burns!

435
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,095
When O2 rapidly enters
an oxygen-depleted environment

436
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,181
causing an explosion,
what is that phenomenon called?

437
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,349
A backdraft, sir!

438
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,935
Correct! Your reward is 30 more pushups.

439
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,353
Next question!

440
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,855
- You guys the fire department?
- Trying to be.

441
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,233
- The pool hall's burning down!
- What, here on the alley?

442
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,152
- Let's move!
- Grab the hose! Go, go!

443
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,535
- We got eyes on a connector!
- Get the hose! Archie, get everyone back!

444
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,246
Earl's in there!
My friend Earl's still inside.

445
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,248
Sarge, don't even think about it.

446
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,127
- Sarge, no!
- Archie, stop!

447
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,233
Mija. Has the Treasury Department
shown up to arrest you yet?

448
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:54,696
Daddy, that Riverdollar bill you had
in your fist, where did you get that?

449
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,033
It's amazing what you find in the trash
when there's no one around to collect it.

450
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,117
I knew it.

451
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,829
So, now you're printing fake Riverdollars
to sabotage me?

452
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,165
You accusing me
of counterfeiting your counterfeit money?

453
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:08,501
My numbers aren't adding up,
and my numbers always add up.

454
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,755
Someone is flooding the economy
with money I didn't print.

455
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,717
Which devalues the money you did print.
Funny how economics works, isn't it?

456
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,179
As Archie would say, Daddy, you suck.

457
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,142
Where did you find this body, Miss Cooper?

458
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,564
I didn't... exactly. An associate did.

459
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,485
In the swamp. And I kn...
I know it's not Polly, but is it...?

460
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,487
Margaret Harper. Yes.

461
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,281
The tell-tale braces
are present on her teeth.

462
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,034
Likely cause of death, trauma.

463
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,662
The left side of her body was pulverized.

464
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,581
As if... with a wrecking ball.

465
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,250
Oh, my God.

466
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,424
Wherefore are my precious Vixens?

467
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,218
I canceled practice.

468
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,636
We need to talk.

469
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,764
For starters, they're our Vixens,
as we agreed.

470
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,516
Fine, fine, fine.

471
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,352
They're our Vixens. Happy now?

472
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,106
No. I wasn't gonna do this, Cheryl,
but I'm officially calling you out.

473
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,620
You've gotten away
with murder in this town

474
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,819
because of your money and your privilege.

475
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:19,280
And I know you've been
through hell and back time and again.

476
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,968
But that doesn't give you a right to be
a holy terror in this town for no reason.

477
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,203
As if you have any idea
what it's been like for me,

478
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,872
holed-up in Thornhill
for the last seven years.

479
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,291
Oh, spare me. This isn't Drag Me to Hell.

480
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,459
You cursed yourself.

481
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,255
And what you're doing
isn't some grand sacrifice, it's selfish.

482
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,258
Oh. So, now funding the school is selfish.

483
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,136
Money alone isn't gonna solve
the problems of this town.

484
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,597
There are people out here
every single day putting in real work.

485
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,106
And I'm not gonna let you
take over the Vixens

486
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,769
for reasons of vanity or revenge.

487
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,690
Cheryl, I want you out here with us,

488
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,192
on the ground, one of the good guys.

489
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,220
But you're gonna have to take
a good hard look in the mirror

490
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,864
and get it together first.

491
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,827
Your cruelty... is beyond words.

492
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,965
Nana Rose! I need your wisdom.

493
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,384
My heart has once again been shattered.

494
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,889
Oh. Miss Marble.

495
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,766
To what do we owe this pleasure?

496
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,768
Miss Blossom.

497
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,603
I went to sell your brother's portrait

498
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:35,273
and made the most disturbing
yet fascinating discovery.

499
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,567
It was a forgery.

500
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,695
A very skillful forgery.

501
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:45,325
And before I call the authorities,
I thought we should chat.

502
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,034
Don't you agree?

503
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,207
What did Bernardo say, sarge?

504
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,834
Rule number one,
don't run into a burning building alone.

505
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,628
Never gonna let me live this down,
are you?

506
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,796
No, sir.

507
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,549
Well, the good news is you're okay,
and you managed to save that man's life.

508
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,551
We know what started the fire yet?

509
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,471
Well, I mean, it's an old building.
It wasn't up to code.

510
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,349
- Still, it's hard not to think it was...
- Arson.

511
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,976
Probably started by Hiram Lodge.

512
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,603
Wait. Who's Hiram Lodge?

513
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,313
Well, he used to be mayor.

514
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,024
Now he's building a new town next to here

515
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:22,529
and doing everything he can to try
and run the rest of us stragglers out.

516
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,365
Another fat cat lining his pockets
by gaming the system.

517
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,367
Welcome to Riverdale.

518
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,785
All right. I'll see you, fellas.

519
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,869
- Bye, sheriff.
- Yeah.

520
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,333
Man, screw that Hiram guy.

521
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,001
It's okay, Eric.

522
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,506
This is just how life is. For now.

523
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,675
No, it's how life always is.

524
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,679
Guys like us are just cannon fodder
for scumbags like Hiram.

525
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:52,642
That guy you pulled out of the building,
Earl, he's one of us. A vet.

526
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:56,396
Another grunt who got chewed up
and spit out by corporate greed.

527
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,651
Man. What the hell
are we fighting for over there

528
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,445
if this is what happens to us
when we come home?

529
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,205
A second body.

530
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,583
They found a second body in the swamp?

531
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,226
How do you think they did that, Reggie?

532
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:22,422
I don't know, boss. It's a big swamp.
But this is not the hill to die on.

533
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,675
No, no, no. The turnpike,
just like the rest of SoDale,

534
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,427
is a necessary smokescreen.

535
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,511
I know.

536
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,222
But... you could either be a villain

537
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,474
and pour concrete over the swamp,

538
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,686
or you could be a hero...
and let them search it properly.

539
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,355
Sure, the turnpike gets delayed.

540
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,732
But who cares?

541
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,901
We both know that's not the real endgame.

542
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,323
You make a good point, Reggie.

543
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,327
We'll acquiesce to the Cooper ladies.
Let them... wade into the muck a while.

544
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,786
I'll make the call.

545
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,251
We're so, so sorry, Deanna.

546
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,544
But you're... You're...

547
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,381
You're sure it's my Margaret?

548
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,427
Yeah. It's her.

549
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,762
No question.

550
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,265
All these years.

551
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,229
At least...
At least now I know where she is.

552
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,565
I can say goodbye.

553
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,236
Who hurt her?

554
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,822
We don't know yet, Miss Harper.

555
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,826
And my sister is also missing.

556
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,788
Other girls, too.

557
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,376
And so, I swear to you...

558
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,171
we will find out who did this.

559
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,850
- Wait, that's not...
- It is. Yeah.

560
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,229
A special delivery,
courtesy of Nana Rose Blossom.

561
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,648
Straight from the Twilight Zone.

562
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,615
Damn, the smell alone.

563
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,159
That's maple syrup and decay.

564
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,869
It's like a rotting tooth.

565
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,329
It could be anything, Jughead.

566
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,833
It could be... It could be human bones
mixed with fake synthetic bones or...

567
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,126
Or it's a Mothman.

568
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,209
It's...

569
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,838
- It's...
- We're not experts.

570
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,340
This person is, though.

571
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,968
- Who?
- This is Dr. Diane Whitley.

572
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,971
She's an anthropology professor
at Centerville U.

573
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,888
She specializes in ancient cultures

574
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,474
and urban legends
and extraterrestrial phenomena.

575
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,768
I say we call her
and see if she'll come here

576
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,396
and examine this
and tell us what we're dealing with.

577
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,356
So what? In the meantime, it's just...

578
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,691
It's business as usual

579
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,485
while a Xenomorph melts
in my diner's back room?

580
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,322
I'll take the night shift. I'll make sure
no one stumbles upon our little friend.

581
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,410
We have to get
to the bottom of this.

582
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:01,539
I suspect my father has flooded the market
with counterfeit bills.

583
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,500
So we'll have to do
an in-depth forensic accounting,

584
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,753
recall all the Riverdollars in circulation

585
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,796
and determine how deep a hole we're in.

586
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,718
But for now, sadly...
we'll have to shut down our operation.

587
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,147
Where did you get those ink stains
on your paws?

588
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,899
And don't say "art class."

589
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,860
I want the truth. Now.

590
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,072
We printed up ten grand instead of one.

591
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,866
Wow.

592
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:42,955
So it wasn't my father
who screwed me over, it was you guys.

593
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,125
You got greedy
and triggered an economic collapse.

594
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,460
Well done, class.

595
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,669
F's for everyone.

596
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,212
We're sorry.

597
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,547
What can we do?

598
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,508
Well...

599
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,595
you're responsible
for that money you printed.

600
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,514
Ten thousand dollars.

601
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,476
And unless you've got a secret stash
of baby Glamergé eggs,

602
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,019
you'll have to work it off.

603
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,190
By providing Riverdale
a much-needed service.

604
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,950
Jackson.

605
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,618
Earl didn't make it.

606
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,789
No.

607
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,583
Yeah, and I found out more
about your pal, Hiram Lodge.

608
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,419
That bastard's done plenty
to deserve what's coming to him.

609
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,379
Jackson.

610
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,631
You put that rifle down. Now.

611
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:35,967
That's an order!

612
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,770
Sorry, sarge,
we're not in the army anymore.

613
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,844
No.

614
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,806
I'm sorry. I won't let you do this.

615
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,058
I won't let you ruin your life
over Hiram Lodge!

616
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,228
My life's already ruined!

617
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:51,107
I lost my leg fighting in a war
that didn't change a damn thing!

618
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,401
None of us mattered.

619
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:59,031
Eric, I know this is dark now,
but when you get into that VA home,

620
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,492
they'll help you see
that things can get better.

621
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,245
They canceled my slot.

622
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,414
I found out this morning.

623
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,917
I needed help. A lifeline, man. I'm lost.

624
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,544
Damn it, I'm lost, Eric!

625
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,965
The only reason I'm fighting so hard
to save this town

626
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,050
is because it's the only thing
keeping me sane.

627
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,680
I'm white-knuckling it out here, too.
I promise you.

628
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:28,102
And my friends don't know...
because they wouldn't understand.

629
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,941
What are we gonna do, sarge?

630
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,903
For a start?

631
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:43,242
I think you should stay in Riverdale.
The fire department needs a new commander

632
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,620
and I can't think
of a better man for the job.

633
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,120
And maybe...

634
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,334
Maybe... we can help each other stay sane.

635
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,152
It was exactly as Pop said.
Things started to shake.

636
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,362
The jukebox turned on.

637
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,741
It was 2 a.m. I went outside.
There was this bright white light.

638
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:51,037
And then I woke up in a booth
and it was 6 a.m.

639
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,872
Hours had gone by. I lost time.

640
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,333
It was a dream.

641
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,043
Prompted by my grandpa's story.

642
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,879
Or is it possible
that you were sleepwalking?

643
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,631
Or... had you been drinking?

644
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,217
That's... besides the point.

645
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,741
I haven't gotten to the craziest part yet.
Will you follow me?

646
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,763
Please?

647
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,480
After I woke up, the first thing I did
was come in here.

648
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,983
Oh... my God.

649
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,194
- I don't understand.
- Me neither.

650
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,322
But something very strange happened
in Riverdale last night.

651
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,869
Paying off your debt
while cleaning up the town.

652
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,497
If there ever was a teachable moment.

653
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,917
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a delivery to make.

654
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,755
So, what's up, guys?

655
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,676
Gossip around the teacher's lounge
is that Weatherbee nixed your RROTC cadets

656
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,637
from being volunteer firefighters.

657
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,182
Yeah, well, he was pretty pissed
I brought them to a burning building.

658
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,852
Well, we wanna sign up. Like we
should have done in the first place.

659
00:39:56,936 --> 00:40:00,648
I appreciate that, guys, but it's
too late. Bernardo's back in New York.

660
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,817
No one left to train us.

661
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,569
Maybe I can help on that front.

662
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,946
Chief Russell.

663
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:11,575
Word got around. About a crazy hero
running into a burning building.

664
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,660
Alone.

665
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,995
Gotta say, it inspired me.

666
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,289
Okay, chief. You're the expert.

667
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,499
What do we need first?

668
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,794
Well... a firetruck might be nice to have.

669
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,217
You gotta be kidding me.

670
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,137
Ronnie, what the hell?

671
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,723
What? I wanted to do my civic duty.

672
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,143
To help you and hurt my father.

673
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,687
- How...? How much do we owe you?
- Oh, don't worry.

674
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,356
We'll be putting out
a "Firefighters of Riverdale" calendar

675
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
to defray the costs.

676
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,446
But in the meantime,
I just wanted to help.

677
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,490
Anything for you, Archie.

678
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,455
Two young women went missing
on the Lonely Highway:

679
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,165
Margaret Harper and Polly.

680
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:02,042
We found Margaret's remains
in Swedlow Swamp.

681
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,128
Where I found Polly's phone.

682
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,590
And we also found
another set of remains in the swamp,

683
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,801
belonging to an unidentified young woman.

684
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,053
And I reached out to sheriffs' offices

685
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,348
in the counties that touch
along the Lonely Highway

686
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,185
asking about any unsolved
missing persons reports,

687
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,895
specifically young women.

688
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,189
And they came back with 13 names.

689
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,400
And I've been in touch
with a network of social workers

690
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,111
in towns the Lonely Highway runs through,

691
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,446
and I got 11 names back.

692
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,115
Five of which overlap with Tom's list.

693
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,534
So, we're talking about 21 missing girls.

694
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,496
How many of them
are we gonna find in Swedlow Swamp?

695
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,248
At least Hiram has agreed
to let us search it now.

696
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,833
Twenty-one girls.

697
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,794
- They can't all be runaways.
- What do you think?

698
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,087
Human trafficking?

699
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,342
Or a serial killer.
