1
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,633
Incoming!

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,176
Fire! Fire!

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,017
Jackson!

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,860
You're gonna be safe down here. I got you.

5
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,528
Hey, look at me.

6
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,196
- You'll be okay.
- Sarge.

7
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,409
Sarge, I can't feel my legs.
Are they there? I can't look.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,619
Retreat!

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,997
Sarge, are they there?

10
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,624
Are they?

11
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,804
- Contact, 2 o'clock, 150 meters!
- Eric.

12
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,640
- Contact, 2 o'clock, 130 meters!
- Stand down!

13
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,356
Eric. It's me. Eric, don't shoot!

14
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,488
Okay. Okay. Shh, shh, shh.

15
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,073
You're okay. You're okay.

16
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,247
Nighthawk, can you hear me?

17
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,917
Loud and clear, Base Station.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,628
I'm still a bumper sticker
on this shady-ass truck.

19
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,213
Headed north.

20
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,800
He's approaching the westbound turnoff
at Exit 49.

21
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,554
Too far. Two more miles
and you'll be out of range.

22
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,931
He's pulling over.

23
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,935
I'm gonna park and approach on foot.

24
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:47,023
Betty, just please, please be careful.

25
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,072
Hey.

26
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,284
Didn't think I'd come across anyone.

27
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,538
Yeah, I'm just taking a break,
stretching my legs.

28
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,999
It gets lonely out here
on the long, dark road.

29
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,044
You want some company?
Even for a little bit?

30
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,754
What, in the woods?

31
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,298
Or maybe back of my truck?

32
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,758
That sounds good.

33
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,390
Do you do this a lot?

34
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,268
Pick up pretty girls on the road?

35
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,189
Yeah, I guess I've had
my fair share of encounters. Yeah.

36
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,775
Uh, before we...

37
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,695
do this, uh...

38
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,572
I wanna make sure that you've got cash.

39
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,365
That's all I needed to hear.

40
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,535
- FBI! Freeze!
- Don't move.

41
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,786
What is this?

42
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,497
FBI. We're taking you in for solicitation.

43
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,959
Okay, this is a mistake.
I am also with the FBI.

44
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,460
No, you're not, Betty.

45
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,088
You quit. Remember?

46
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,134
What are you doing?

47
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,761
I'm trying to catch our killer.
What are you doing, Glen?

48
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,638
Trying to clean up the Lonely Highway.

49
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,640
By entrapping young women?

50
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,268
We should be helping them,
not arresting them.

51
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,062
God, I should have stabbed you harder.

52
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,858
You do realize it's illegal
to impersonate an FBI agent, right?

53
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,277
You shouldn't have that badge or a gun.

54
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,070
Hand them over.

55
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,364
Or should I arrest you?

56
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,932
Wait. Kevin?

57
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,105
Compulsion, thy name is Kevin of Finland.

58
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,860
Does Eric have chronic nightmares?

59
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,154
Yeah. But...

60
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,200
Nothing like last night.
It's like he was living it.

61
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,788
What about you?
Any nightmares since the war?

62
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,875
Yeah. I mean, yeah, at first.

63
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,503
But I haven't had one in months.

64
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,757
I've known soldiers like Eric.

65
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,927
They've crossed the Rubicon
and the only way back is with help.

66
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,930
Wasn't there a recovery place
that Eric was supposed to go to?

67
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:28,101
Yeah. He tried calling,
and they kept promising him a spot, but...

68
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,227
Still nothing.

69
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,896
Don't give up.

70
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,149
In the meantime,
I'll look into something else.

71
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,698
What are those?

72
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,159
Leads I got on the DL
from a former colleague in New York.

73
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,746
Names of fat cats
with money burning holes in their pockets.

74
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,039
Potential investors.

75
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,582
Branching out from jewelry?

76
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,877
I need to start making money, Reggie.
Real money.

77
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,339
To replace all the funds that Chad lost
in his pathetic Ponzi scheme.

78
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,842
Funds I'm responsible for. The snake...

79
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,345
So I'm getting back
into aggressive investment banking.

80
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,681
Don't you have to be on Wall Street?

81
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,224
Common misconception.

82
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,935
All you need is two things,

83
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,603
this and names.

84
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,106
Which means, time to make it rain.

85
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,401
Good morning, Cheryl.

86
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,944
Can I help you?

87
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,947
No, no, no, sweet Kevin.

88
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,199
The question is, can I help you?

89
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,535
We saw each other in the woods.

90
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:31,789
I was seeking inspiration
for my next sermon, but what about you?

91
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,752
I thought you gave up cruising
after your latest violent encounter.

92
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,046
I did, for a while.

93
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:38,963
I see.

94
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,549
Do you know what I believe, Kevin?

95
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,676
I don't think
you were looking for a hookup.

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,846
I also think you were looking for meaning.

97
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,805
Peace.

98
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,768
No. I'm pretty sure
I was just looking for a hookup.

99
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,687
Kev-Kev.

100
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:59,525
I don't know if you heard, but my mother
and I recently started a ministry.

101
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,153
Why don't you come to a service?

102
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,964
You might find the answers
you're looking for.

103
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:08,034
No offense, Cheryl, but that sounds
like a classic Blossom scam.

104
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:12,997
Well, I can't speak for Mumzie,
but for me it's no scam.

105
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,667
Understand, my calling is
for a high purpose.

106
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,672
Since I began ministering,
I felt the best I have since...

107
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,885
Since the night
of that misbegotten key party.

108
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,472
What's the harm in trying one service?

109
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,184
Okay. Yeah.
I'll come, just to check it out.

110
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,357
You're lucky it was Glen
and not the Highway Killer.

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,318
- You would have been on your own.
- I didn't wanna lose him.

112
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,863
I doubt I'll be spending more time
on the Lonely Highway,

113
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,074
now that Glen's gunning for me.

114
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:53,329
So maybe we bring the Lonely Highway here,

115
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,873
to Pop's and the Whyte Wyrm.

116
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,500
Go on.

117
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,045
The Highway Killer is most likely
a trucker, right?

118
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,383
Well, what if we offer something
to lure truckers in?

119
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,759
Entertainment?

120
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,386
Smart.

121
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,471
We're not going after truckers, plural.

122
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,266
We're going after one trucker, our killer,

123
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,893
who is targeting young women.

124
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,064
Have you ever seen Coyote Ugly?

125
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,444
Um, please. "Can't Fight the Moonlight"
is one of my karaoke go-tos.

126
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,864
So maybe that's what we need
to tempt our little friend.

127
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,825
Riverdale's very own Coyote Ugly.

128
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,620
And we can wire Pop's and the Wyrm
with closed-circuit cameras.

129
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,291
We can start compiling a database
that not even the FBI has.

130
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,501
Tracking regulars,
running license plates...

131
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,585
Let's do it.

132
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,170
Together.

133
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,798
We'll talk to Fangs.

134
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,386
We wait six hours to see someone

135
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,972
and they tell us
we haven't filled out the right forms.

136
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,727
Sorry, sarge, but that's what happens
every time I go to the VA.

137
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,645
Archie, Eric,
come into the living room.

138
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,944
Fellas, meet our new roommate.

139
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,666
Where'd you get this idea?

140
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,002
I've known many veterans who adopted pets.

141
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,125
It's part of their transition
back to civilian life.

142
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,632
Helps with their anxiety,
adds structure to their day,

143
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,217
gives them a loyal companion.

144
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,677
- Where'd you get him?
- At the shelter downtown.

145
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,180
According to the vet,
they found him near a dumpster.

146
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,098
Did they tell you
what happened to his ears?

147
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,059
No. They weren't sure.

148
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,728
Hey, Arch, didn't you have a dog?

149
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,605
- What was his name?
- Vegas.

150
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,815
- What happened to him?
- When I enlisted,

151
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,526
Mom took him to Chicago with her.

152
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,903
He died while I was overseas.

153
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,404
Aw, damn.

154
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,032
I'm sorry, Arch.

155
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,951
He was my best friend.

156
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,788
Maybe this little pooch will be good
for both of you.

157
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,398
Let me ask you this,
have you ever invested in an IPO?

158
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,817
We have numerous opportunities
in the pipeline

159
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,152
that I'd be happy to walk you through.

160
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,199
Of course, Mr. Mamet.
Thank you for your time.

161
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,579
You win some, you lose some.

162
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,582
Yes, but I'm losing more
than winning, Reggie.

163
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,251
Back in New York,
when I was the She-Wolf of Wall Street,

164
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,003
I had a team of 20.

165
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,005
But now I'm one broker

166
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,841
with no firm to back her up.

167
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,802
Let's double our chances.
Let me work for you.

168
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,762
You can't just start trading.

169
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,765
You have to understand finance,
politics, diplomacy...

170
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,017
Really?

171
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,769
'Cause I've been listening to you all day

172
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,981
and it sounds to me like you just need
to know how to close a sale.

173
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,108
Like I do at my old man's car lot.

174
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,735
I can close, Ronnie.

175
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,862
I'm a closer.

176
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,447
Give me a shot.

177
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,530
Okay.

178
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,702
It's two o'clock now.

179
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:24,957
If you can turn one lead into a sale
by the time the stock exchange closes,

180
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,711
- I'll cut you in.
- One client? By six o'clock?

181
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,797
The New York Stock Exchange
closes at 4, Reggie.

182
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,467
Clock's ticking.

183
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:42,016
So, Fangs, we have an idea
that we would love for you to run by Toni.

184
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,061
- Okay.
- If we want to attract the Highway Killer,

185
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,855
we have to give him
something enticing to look at.

186
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:52,485
So, what do you think about turning
this place into a Coyote Ugly-style bar?

187
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,862
Like the Tyra Banks movie?

188
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,197
Exactly.

189
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,076
Hot ladies dancing on the bar.
Fully clothed, of course.

190
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,038
And free-flowing booze.
It would be the perfect thirst trap.

191
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,544
And who are the hot ladies?

192
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,628
Us.

193
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,129
We are.

194
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,593
I'm trying to get a referral to a doctor.

195
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,515
My name is Sergeant Archie Andrews.

196
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:26,227
I'm calling on behalf of Eric Jackson
about getting him some treatment.

197
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,437
I've left my number.

198
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,856
If you could give me a call back,
that would great.

199
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,941
Thank you.

200
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,282
How you doing?

201
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,828
Thinking about Vegas?

202
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,540
No. I'm thinking about Bingo.

203
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,165
Who's Bingo?

204
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,133
He was this stray dog
that our platoon adopted.

205
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,595
- What happened to him?
- He didn't make it.

206
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,099
Yeah. We don't like talking about it much.

207
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,310
It's probably why Eric is so happy
about this new dog.

208
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,855
To make up for Bingo.

209
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,857
Yeah.

210
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,150
That makes sense.

211
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,823
I want this for you.

212
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,242
And more importantly,
you should want this for yourself.

213
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,744
You're a smart guy, Bobby.

214
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,874
Think about what this investment
could mean for your family.

215
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:35,129
I'm talking a down payment on a house,
college tuition for your son or daughter,

216
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,799
vacations you deserve
but haven't been able to afford.

217
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,051
You're in at 100?

218
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,098
Mr. Stone,

219
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,601
I'm telling you, you won't regret this.

220
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,729
Mm-hm. I'll e-mail you the paperwork.

221
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,234
Very good, Reginald.

222
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,195
You're a natural salesman.

223
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,697
Welcome, officially, to Pearls and Posh.

224
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,284
Look, Cheryl, I don't mean to offend you,

225
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,162
but your service wasn't exactly my speed.

226
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:09,788
To each his own.

227
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:14,126
But there is a hole inside you
that you're trying to fill.

228
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,086
I think I know what it's about.

229
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,256
Fangs, how you left things with him.

230
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,097
Breaking up with him,
especially the way I did,

231
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,058
is the worst thing I've done.

232
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,435
- Maybe ever.
- Regret.

233
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,562
It haunts you.

234
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,025
I know because it haunts me too.

235
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,569
Go to your man.

236
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,822
Try to make amends. Say you're sorry.

237
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,866
Ask for clemency.

238
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,287
Regardless of how he responds,
you'll feel better having tried.

239
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,002
Kevin.

240
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,257
Hey, this is a surprise.

241
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,383
Hey, Fangs.

242
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,263
I know we haven't talked,
but I have stuff to get off my chest,

243
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,932
- so I hope you'll hear me out.
- For sure.

244
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,684
Right now isn't a good time.

245
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,563
If I don't say it now,
I'm gonna lose my nerve, so just...

246
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,608
- Kev...
- More baguette to the rescue.

247
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,028
- Oh, my God.
- Kevin!

248
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,905
- Moose?
- It's been a while.

249
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,825
This isn't... This isn't what it looks...

250
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,493
You're seeing Moose Mason?

251
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:33,289
- We just ran into each other.
- Kev, why don't you sit down?

252
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,083
We'll have a glass of wine,
we can talk about this.

253
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,585
Yeah. No, thank you.

254
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,920
I've gotta wake up from this nightmare

255
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,923
in which my ex-boyfriends
are sleeping together.

256
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,217
Kevin.

257
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,185
- Hey, Eric!
- Incoming!

258
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,063
I know you're tired,
but you gotta wait until nightfall,

259
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,815
then I can carry you out of here.

260
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,818
We're gonna get you help,
but you gotta keep your eyes open.

261
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,115
Sarge, is...?

262
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,952
- Is that Bingo?
- Yeah. I'll bring him back.

263
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,705
- Where is he?
- In the middle of no-man's-land.

264
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,167
That's no good.
You can't go out there. You'll get shot.

265
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,878
I can make it if I'm fast.

266
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,339
You can't go out there. No way.

267
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,883
- I can't just ignore him.
- You will die.

268
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,011
You're my only hope of getting out.

269
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,014
I can get Bingo and bring him back,
and I can take you both.

270
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,767
We're in their crosshairs.
We've gotta wait them out.

271
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,353
I have to do it.
I can't leave Bingo out there to die.

272
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,105
Sarge, no! I won't let you!

273
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,859
Eric, what the hell?

274
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,986
Sarge, you gotta help. The dog, he's gone!

275
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,739
- What?
- He's missing. We gotta find him!

276
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,663
- How did he get out?
- It's okay. Calm down. I found him.

277
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,665
- Where?
- Come here, check it out.

278
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,053
- How'd he get in there?
- I guess the door was ajar.

279
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,932
He was looking for a place to hide.

280
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,649
Mr. Preston, it's Reginald Mantle
from Pearls and Posh.

281
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,902
Do I have an exciting proposition for you.

282
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,697
Yes, Mr. Gibbs, we're smaller
than some of the New York firms,

283
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,449
but it means we'll work
that much harder for you.

284
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,452
And just to be clear,
though I want your business,

285
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,162
I don't need your business.

286
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,875
Nolan, there's no judgment here.

287
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,503
If you wanna go
the target-mutual-funds route, I get it.

288
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:48,132
It's safe. But the truth is,
scared money doesn't make money.

289
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,634
What I'm offering you is a sure thing.

290
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,428
Welcome aboard, Mrs. Artemis.

291
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,848
You will surely be bragging
to your friends at tea time this Saturday.

292
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,934
Speak to you very, very soon.
Okay. Bye-bye.

293
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,438
I just closed my fifth client.

294
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,773
I just closed my third. We're killing it.

295
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,818
We are proving ourselves
to be capable, but...

296
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,572
we need more leads to call.
I'm all tapped out of names.

297
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,117
What's my commission
for all the fish I'm catching?

298
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,036
Industry standard, 5%.

299
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,039
If I get us some fresh leads,
will you bump me to 15%?

300
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,708
If you can really bring in new business:

301
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,834
10%.

302
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,253
Okay, then. But there's one caveat:

303
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,048
The leads are from SoDale.

304
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,342
SoDale? What are you talking about?

305
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,095
The thing about SoDale is,
it doesn't exist.

306
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,097
It's a muddy field with no construction.

307
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:41,935
Your dad sold his investors on a vision
of something that will never be built.

308
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,772
He's using the money
to fund his palladium search.

309
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,191
Aren't his investors asking questions?

310
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,108
Constantly.

311
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,528
But he's always got an excuse
for why the new houses aren't finished.

312
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,988
So I'm thinking...

313
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,616
What if we go
after my father's investors...

314
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,454
and get them to pull out of SoDale
and invest with us?

315
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,582
Reggie, you're a genius.

316
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,176
Hey. It's okay. Just calm down.
Keep some pressure on it.

317
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,761
What the hell happened?

318
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,864
Eric took the dog for a walk.
They ran into a bigger dog.

319
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,890
Our guy freaked out,
Eric tried to calm him down...

320
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,267
- And he bit my arm!
- That's it. We're done.

321
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,228
- Where are you going?
- I'm calling the shelter.

322
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,105
Archie, please. This is all my fault.

323
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,525
Give me five minutes to clean up Eric
and I'll explain everything.

324
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,404
So how is a rescue dog biting Eric
your fault?

325
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,699
Dog I brought home isn't
an ordinary rescue.

326
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,327
The woman at the shelter told me,
based on his injuries,

327
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,996
he was likely part of a dog-fighting ring.

328
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,708
Are you kidding?
That's happening here in Riverdale?

329
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,003
They started a few years ago,
after everyone began moving away,

330
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,839
leaving their pets behind.

331
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:56,426
The shelter rescues as many as they can,
but some wound up with the wrong people.

332
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,887
Scumbags who pit dogs against each other

333
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,348
and bet on which ones will win
and which ones will die.

334
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,724
I'll be back.

335
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:11,483
Mrs. Rawald, you wouldn't have happened
to invest in SoDale LLC?

336
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,988
Uh-huh. And how is that investment doing,
Mr. Barry?

337
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,533
Have you seen any houses in SoDale?
Any blueprints?

338
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,828
Construction's not happening
as quickly as I'd like.

339
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:28,333
I have it on very good authority
that there will never be a SoDale.

340
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:34,256
So... might I suggest you withdraw
your funds from SoDale LLC

341
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,633
and invest with us at Pearls and Posh.

342
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,844
You're telling me SoDale's a scam?

343
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,723
Give me a minute.
I'll get Hiram Lodge on the other line.

344
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,726
Chris Barry. Always a pleasure
to hear your voice.

345
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,228
- How's Cindy?
- I'm not happy.

346
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,231
I have a source telling me
that I made a bad investment with you.

347
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,441
SoDale.

348
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,568
Whoa! That's absurd.

349
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,404
SoDale is the finest investment
you could put your money into.

350
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,615
In fact, you should double down.

351
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,075
How does 30% returns
over three years sound?

352
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,914
He's selling me on 30% at three years,
Ms. Posh. Can you match that?

353
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:11,001
How about an ROI of 35% at three?

354
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,172
I'll throw in a Glamourge Egg as a bonus,
but that's my final offer.

355
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,423
What do you say, Chris?

356
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:20,177
This is onetime-only, exclusive FOH,
"Friends of Hiram," offer.

357
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,055
Thirty-five percent
and a Glamourge Egg. Okay.

358
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,764
I'm in.

359
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,309
Thank you, Mr. Barry.

360
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,270
You are in good hands at Pearls and Posh.

361
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,608
Sorry, Lodge,
but I'm pulling out of SoDale.

362
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:38,362
If I don't get my money back, I'll be
calling the State Attorney's office.

363
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,988
Best of luck with your venture.

364
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,118
To you, Ronnie.

365
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,415
The She-Wolf of Wall Street.

366
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,091
So, what happens now?

367
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,928
We take the night off
to help Betty and Tabitha,

368
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,890
and then we keep doing
exactly what we're doing.

369
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,271
Fangs with Moose, you say?

370
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,899
Yeah, I caught them having wine
and cheese.

371
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,734
That's diabolical.

372
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,737
Kevin, you did nothing wrong.

373
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,283
And you brought your sacred truth
to his profane threshold.

374
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,617
That alone is a victory.

375
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,745
Then why do I feel so forsaken?

376
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,002
In godless times like these,

377
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,379
instead of focusing on yourself,

378
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:41,425
perhaps the only way to know true comfort
is by comforting others.

379
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,596
Tonight, I'm assisting Betty and Tabitha
in a most ingenious ruse

380
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,974
to thwart the evil goings-on
of the Lonely Highway.

381
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,145
Work with us on this, Kevin.

382
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:58,734
And perhaps in service,
you will find peace and meaning.

383
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,988
Okay, gather round, people.
This is it.

384
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,906
Hopefully, it will be a big night.

385
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,700
We'll be checking everyone's IDs,

386
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:10,037
aka writing down their names
and driver's license numbers,

387
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,330
regardless of their age.

388
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,624
After my new cameras catch
their faces coming in.

389
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,917
Mom, you'll work the bar,

390
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,545
keeping an eye out for anything sketchy.

391
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,880
As I usually do.

392
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,049
Shouldn't Fangs be here?

393
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,884
Isn't he managing for Toni?

394
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,887
Yeah, but he's helping Archie
with some dog thing tonight,

395
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,388
so Toni asked me to step in.

396
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,183
Veronica, Cheryl, Tabitha,
and I will be performing.

397
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:35,312
While we keep the truckers busy,
our stealth team of Kevin and Reggie

398
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:39,566
will be jimmying open their trailers
and looking for anything suspicious.

399
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,526
If you find something, I'll check it out.

400
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,363
Our main goal of the night is recon, okay?

401
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,115
Get names, get licenses.

402
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:51,453
And, cardinal rule, no one goes off alone
with any truckers, okay?

403
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,163
Are we ready to do this?

404
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,002
I asked around, Archie, and it's true.

405
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,296
The dog-fighting ring in town.

406
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,548
Once a month,
sickos from as far as Montreal

407
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,593
meet to at that address to bet on dogs.

408
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,763
- That's where the ringleader lives.
- When's the next round?

409
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:13,058
Not for another couple of weeks.
Enough time to loop in Sheriff Keller.

410
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,812
We're not looping in Sheriff Keller.
Or my uncle.

411
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,231
I don't want this scumbag arrested.

412
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:23,401
- I want him hurt.
- Sarge, our priority is saving the dogs.

413
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,906
Yeah. But that doesn't mean
we can't settle up with this guy too.

414
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,453
- Hey. What's going on?
- I'm an agent with the FBI.

415
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,998
We're investigating illegal contraband
being shipped down from Montreal.

416
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,959
I need you to open up the back.

417
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,803
Okay, no contraband.
But can you explain the blood?

418
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:59,266
Yeah. I just did a huge meat delivery.
That's cow's blood.

419
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,977
I assume you have documents
to back that up?

420
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,853
Yeah. In my cab.

421
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,537
Get the dogs. I'll go inside.

422
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,206
- Hold on.
- Just do it. This won't take long.

423
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,591
- Those your dogs outside?
- Who are you?

424
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,760
I said, are those your dogs?

425
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,262
Yeah. I train them.

426
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,556
Why? You wanna buy one?

427
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,560
You and me,
we're gonna have a real dog fight.

428
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,911
- You like that? You sicko!
- Stop.

429
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,540
- You like getting beaten?
- Sarge! Sarge, enough!

430
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,963
You can call Sheriff Keller now
or the garbage man, I don't care which.

431
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,174
But if you touch one more dog,

432
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,593
I'm gonna dig your grave myself.

433
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,183
Not a complete success.

434
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:27,395
But 57 truckers total with their names
and driver's license numbers.

435
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,982
Not a bad start to a list
of possible suspects, partner.

436
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,110
I'll do some background checks on them,

437
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,488
and tomorrow night
we'll do more dancing and recon.

438
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,782
No rest for the weary, huh?

439
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,836
Hey.

440
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,883
Is this where the Wild Foxes perform?
Saw a sign on the highway.

441
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:01,554
Uh, yeah, but you missed it.
Our last call was an hour ago.

442
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,972
Come back tomorrow.

443
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,308
Shoot. I was looking
for a good time tonight.

444
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,353
What are you doing now?

445
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,153
I was gonna go home, but...

446
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:22,158
I could be down
for a little fun if you are.

447
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,368
Yeah, hop in.

448
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,663
I know a motel not far from here.

449
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,039
Sounds good.

450
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,712
So are you just passing through town?

451
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,798
Visiting my grandmother.

452
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,844
She's pretty sick.
I'm getting ready to say my goodbyes.

453
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,680
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- No. It's all right.

454
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,934
It's a beautiful thing, really,
watching someone pass.

455
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,730
Watching as the light fades
from their eyes.

456
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,483
There's nothing like it.

457
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,780
You mind if I stop to take a leak?

458
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,864
No, sure.

459
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,283
I'll be two minutes, tops.

460
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,996
Tabitha. I got him.

461
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,415
I'm on my way. Don't do anything crazy.

462
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,754
Betty. Are you okay?

463
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:03,838
Yeah.

464
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,631
I am.

465
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,384
But I need your help with him.

466
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,981
I'm gonna take a shower.

467
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,153
Wild guess...

468
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,239
- You guys went after the dog fighter.
- Yeah.

469
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,367
Sarge went berserk on him.

470
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,953
I wish he wouldn't have done that.

471
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,667
Can't say that I'm surprised.
Not after what happened to Bingo.

472
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,544
What are you talking about?

473
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,798
Bingo. Your platoon dog?

474
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:53,012
Archie told me how you two were
pinned down in the foxhole...

475
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:59,477
and you had to sit there and listen
to Bingo howling and dying and...

476
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,399
Frank, Bingo wasn't a dog.

477
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,195
He was a grunt like me.

478
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,452
What do we do now?

479
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,998
We find a out-of-the-way place
to park the truck.

480
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,208
What about the guy? The killer?

481
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,211
I have a place
where we can take him and keep him.

482
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,839
- Shouldn't we hand him over to the FBI?
- Not yet.

483
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,509
If there's a chance
he knows where Polly is...

484
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,846
I want him to give up that information.

485
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,391
At which point, we will hand him over.

486
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,652
Arch, Eric told me the truth about Bingo.

487
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,280
Wanna talk about it?

488
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,616
What's there to talk about?

489
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,452
I've been to war, Archie.

490
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,996
I know the impossible decisions
you have to make.

491
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,916
To hear Eric tell it,
if you had gone back for Bingo,

492
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,294
you and Eric probably wouldn't
have made it either.

493
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,381
You made a choice in the moment
and it was the right choice.

494
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,885
You can't save everyone.

495
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,013
It feels wrong.

496
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,349
Everything feels wrong.

497
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,603
I'm trying to save this town,
but it is so...

498
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,688
corrupt.

499
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,068
Broken, full of awful, despicable people.

500
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,779
I mean, the lowest of the lows.
Dog fighters.

501
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,115
Makes me think
there's nothing worth saving here.

502
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,826
Don't lose sight of what you're doing.

503
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,628
Kevin, I heard you being summoned
to Weatherbee's office.

504
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,963
Were you fired for your cruising ways?

505
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:56,094
No, Cheryl. Actually, the opposite.
I've just been named Teacher of the Year.

506
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,887
Oh, but that's incredible.

507
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,640
So why the forlorn face?

508
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,518
- Is it Fangs?
- Yeah.

509
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,479
But also it's my entire life.

510
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,980
I love being a teacher,

511
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,608
but it was never supposed
to be my life's calling.

512
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:16,280
This award is a painful reminder
of all that I haven't accomplished.

513
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:20,159
I'm supposed to be in New York.
Writing, performing, directing.

514
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,205
Instead, I'm in Riverdale,
still cruising the woods.

515
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,707
Unlucky in love,

516
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,418
being named Teacher of the Year
at a dying high school.

517
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,088
This can't be my life. It can't be.

518
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,842
I think I have an idea
that might not fix all of your problems,

519
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:39,095
but will replenish your artist's soul.

520
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,352
Well? What do you think?

521
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,272
Not everybody in Riverdale is rotten.

522
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,066
How'd you guys pull this off?

523
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,319
Eric and I called some shelters, told them
we had dogs that needed homes.

524
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,990
Good dogs who maybe need
more attention and rehabilitation

525
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:02,034
before they can get adopted
'cause of what they've been through.

526
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:05,621
- Almost gives you hope again, huh?
- Almost.

527
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,959
No, this is good. This is great.

528
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:13,421
Hey, Sarge. You think it'd be okay
if we call him Bingo?

529
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,632
- Wouldn't be disrespectful, would it?
- No, no. Hey!

530
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,093
We loved Bingo.

531
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,429
I think he'd be honored.

532
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,023
Brothers and sisters, this week,

533
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:36,861
I learned a simple yet profound truth.

534
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,698
It is in making those around us feel good

535
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:43,242
that we ourselves may find salvation.

536
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,246
"Comfort. Yes, comfort, my people."

537
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,498
Isaiah, Chapter 40, Verse 1.

538
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,959
As a reminder of that lesson,

539
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,462
today's closing hymn
will be "Everything Is All right"

540
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,673
from the iconic musical
Jesus Christ Superstar.

541
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:03,012
And singing with me will be our ministry's
new artistic director, Kevin Keller.

542
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:16,377
Let me start by saying
I'm sorry you had to walk in on that.

543
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:20,006
We were trying to figure out a way
to tell you without causing a spiral.

544
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,633
- My spiraling days are over.
- Listen.

545
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,429
I know this may be impossible, Kev...

546
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,724
but I'd love for us to be friends.

547
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,769
We are friends, Fangs.

548
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,648
And if you and Moose make
each other happy, I'm happy. Seriously.

549
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,045
We'll be in this together, Jim.

550
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,589
We're both family men. Wife and kids.

551
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,425
I can hear it in your voice
that you want this.

552
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,219
I'm gonna pass you on
to the queen of the shop,

553
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,431
and she's gonna tell you
why you deserve it, okay?

554
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,098
Hold on.

555
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:17,188
- I think I got him. He just needs a push.
- Say no more.

556
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:23,152
Mr. Nesper, I hear you're considering
a promising opportunity,

557
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,612
and I just have to say,

558
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,740
this isn't about
what you're putting down right now.

559
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,450
This is about legacy.

560
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,952
How are you talking care
of yourself and your family

561
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,246
for the rest of your life and theirs?

562
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,795
We absolutely can
and we'll do that for you, Mr. Nesper.

563
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:45,549
And might I add that Pearls and Posh
is honored to be doing business with you?

564
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,094
Bingo!

565
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,391
Bingo!

566
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,143
You there?

567
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,020
Answer me, private! That's an order!

568
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,693
Eric, what's happening?
Why isn't Bingo answering me?

569
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,404
He's dead, sarge.

570
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,949
Bingo is dead.

571
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,765
Hello?

572
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,937
Yeah, this is Sergeant Andrews.

573
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,233
I was calling on behalf of my friend,
Corporal Jackson.

574
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,698
Bingo?

575
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,836
I think I might need help too.
