1
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,389
I'm not gonna lie to you.

2
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:17,308
What awaits us is like nothing
we've ever faced.

3
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,060
But we will not be afraid.

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,399
- Do you know why?!
- 'Cause we're Bulldogs!

5
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:27,318
And Bulldogs never give up.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,282
Men, your mission is to penetrate
the enemy's defenses,

7
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,411
retrieve your fallen brother
and return safely to base.

8
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,538
- Are we clear?
- Sir, yes, sir!

9
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,998
Let's do this!

10
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,833
Let's do this thing! Yeah!

11
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,840
Hut 32! Hut 32!

12
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,063
Reggie!

13
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,367
Let's go!

14
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,661
Let's go, Bulldogs, let's go!

15
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,998
- One more time!
- Let's go, Bulldogs, let's go!

16
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,460
When I say "bull," you say "dogs."

17
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,962
-Bull! Bull!
-Dogs! Dogs!

18
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,131
When I say "bull," you say "dogs."

19
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,009
-Bull! Bull!
-Dogs! Dogs!

20
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,735
Archie. Just a little help.

21
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,327
Archie!

22
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,517
Rise and shine, sergeant.

23
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,813
At ease, Andrews.

24
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,857
Ready to go home, son?

25
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,277
Home?

26
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,115
No, sir. No, I'm ready
to get back in the fight.

27
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,951
Sergeant, you've given
seven years to the Army.

28
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,411
Seven good years.

29
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,497
Every man in your unit
will attest to that.

30
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,457
They're alive because of you.

31
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,876
Not all of them, sir.

32
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,255
I've done some digging.

33
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:57,552
The RROTC program
at your old high school has been inactive.

34
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,305
I can't think of anyone
more qualified to bring it back.

35
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:04,350
All due respect, sir, I didn't join
the Army to be a desk jockey.

36
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,352
This is not a request, sergeant.

37
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,897
It's an order.

38
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,565
Sign your papers.

39
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,402
And by the by,
Corporal Jackson just transferred in.

40
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,534
"In the late summer of that year,
we lived in a house, in a village

41
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,454
that looked across the river
and the plain to the mountains.

42
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,300
In the bed of the river,
there were pebbles and boulders.

43
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,636
Dry and white in the sun.

44
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,223
And the water was clear
and swiftly moving.

45
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,266
And blue in the channels."

46
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,977
Look who cleans up respectable.

47
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,063
Give me a break.

48
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,111
How you feeling?

49
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:01,074
Actually, they got me
on so many pain meds, I'm good.

50
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,327
You? Going somewhere?

51
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,370
Yeah, home.

52
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,913
Riverdale.

53
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,167
Taylor wants me running the RROTC,
working enlistment.

54
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,710
Dude, that's messed up.

55
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,257
Jackson...

56
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,177
I just wanna tell you how sorry I am.

57
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,639
I really wish it was me in that bed.

58
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,848
I do too.

59
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,940
Sarge,

60
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,694
only reason I'm still breathing is
'cause of you.

61
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,367
Riverdale, huh?

62
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,453
Sounds nice.

63
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,459
This is my address.

64
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,753
When you get out of here, look me up.

65
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,213
Thanks, Sarge.

66
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,798
Will do.

67
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,146
Something wrong, soldier boy?

68
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,524
No. No, everything's fine.

69
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,902
If you're hungry, grab a stool.
Coffee's fresh.

70
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,575
Or if you want something stronger,
head downstairs.

71
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,675
Damn, Toni. It's good to see you.

72
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,386
Yeah. You too. You're all grown up.

73
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,346
I don't know about that.

74
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,516
-But you, you're, uh--
-Pregnant?

75
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,976
Yeah, I am.

76
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,271
Still a badass though.
Who's the dad? Can I ask?

77
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,355
You can.

78
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,900
But I'm not gonna answer you. It's--

79
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:08,196
It's a secret. Just for now.
Glad to see you're back in one piece.

80
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,114
Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm good.

81
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,118
-Who owns this place now?
-Me and the Serpents.

82
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,872
We all put our cash together
and bought it from Hiram Lodge.

83
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,417
A girl's gotta be creative
to survive in Riverdale these days.

84
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,924
Toni, the bus ride into town...

85
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,427
I can't explain it. It--

86
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,931
Everything felt or feels--

87
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,766
Different? Weird?

88
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,977
Yeah. To be honest,
it doesn't feel like Riverdale.

89
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,689
Yeah. Well, a lot has changed
since we graduated high school.

90
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,149
Yeah, no kidding.

91
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,152
For starters, where's Pop Tate?

92
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,654
Well, haven't you heard?

93
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,490
I thought that's why you came back.

94
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,116
No, I was reassigned here.

95
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,287
Toni, what happened to Pop Tate?

96
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,405
How are the nightmares, Betty?
Are they still keeping you up at night?

97
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,658
-No. I haven't had one in weeks.
-Good.

98
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,202
I'm more than ready to get back to work.

99
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,787
You are working, I thought.

100
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,374
I've been assigned to cold cases,
which means I'm filing all day.

101
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,710
Betty, you suffered severe trauma.

102
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,588
You were, and still are, only a trainee.

103
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,259
I caught serial killers
in high school, Dr. Starling.

104
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,344
Not like the Trash Bag Killer.

105
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,347
You'd be surprised.

106
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,976
I found something, Glen.
A connection.

107
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,146
There was a set of murders
in Odessa, Texas,

108
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,816
that stopped without the killer
getting caught, no explanation.

109
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,279
Months later, in Fargo, North Dakota,
there's a similar string of killings.

110
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,948
The victim profiles match,
as well as the methods used,

111
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,743
and, again, the killings stopped
for no reason.

112
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,954
You're thinking
we have a migrating serial killer?

113
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,914
Yes, Glen. I have a hunch.

114
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,499
Betty, stop.

115
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,837
You're supposed to be logging cold cases,
not sewing a crazy quilt out of them.

116
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,883
-The last time you followed a hunch...
-The Trash Bag Killer.

117
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,885
I get it. I messed up bigtime.

118
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,723
How am I supposed to make up for it
if I'm locked in a basement?

119
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,476
How am I supposed to redeem myself?

120
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,437
Listen, it's late.

121
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,856
How about we call it a day?

122
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,484
I can pick up some pizza and beer,
meet at my place.

123
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,904
I can't tonight. I have plans.

124
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,031
Oh. Do you?

125
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,033
I'm meeting friends for Thai.

126
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:05,081
Watch as the hunters
take off, chasing down their prey.

127
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,835
The gazelle, while badly wounded,
tries to run.

128
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,839
But after a long and meticulous stalk,

129
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:18,928
the hunters show no fear
as they chase down and kill their prey.

130
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,691
With their sharp teeth and claws,

131
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,944
they are bred for violence.

132
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,606
Where are you, kitty?

133
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,378
Any nightmares
this week, Betty?

134
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,800
No. Sleeping like a baby.

135
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,764
Unless you're willing to open up to me,

136
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,683
about what you went through
while you were held captive by TBK,

137
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,852
I won't be able to help you, Betty.

138
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,481
You know, when I got to TBK's lair...

139
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,734
Theresa was already dead.

140
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,739
It wouldn't have mattered if I'd gone
in there with a SWAT team.

141
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,032
He'd already killed her.

142
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,160
That's true.

143
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,163
But if you'd waited for backup,
you might not have been captured.

144
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,416
The Trash Bag Killer
might not have escaped.

145
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,334
Yeah.

146
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,170
That was a mistake.

147
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,589
I regret that.

148
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,885
You haven't said much
about your time in captivity.

149
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,055
Two weeks. Do you think about it a lot?

150
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,559
I think about
where TBK might be right now.

151
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,771
I think about the people he might--

152
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,482
He might hurt

153
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,276
because of me.

154
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,906
Sorry. I usually have it off.

155
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,744
I have to go home for a few days.

156
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,954
To Riverdale.

157
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,581
Okay. Yeah, sure.

158
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,042
While you're there,
pack up the FBI satellite office.

159
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,670
-Okay.
-Where you and your killer brother worked.

160
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,548
Yes, I will pack up the office.
No problem.

161
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,092
You have to watch my cat, Toffee.

162
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,927
Sure. Yeah, I can do that.

163
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,346
But I will need a key.

164
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,893
And since I won't be seeing you
for a few days,

165
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,769
do I get a kiss goodbye?

166
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,493
To one glorious year of marriage.

167
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,329
To you and me forever, babe.

168
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,581
Happy anniversary.

169
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,416
Happy anniversary, Chadwick.

170
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,129
The only thing we're missing is

171
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,132
a little Chad
or a little Veronica running around.

172
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:29,219
I have a feeling this could be the year.
Don't you think?

173
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,889
Hopefully.

174
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:38,646
Maybe it's time to think about
cutting back your hours at Lacy's.

175
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,775
It's 2021, Chad. Haven't you heard?
Women can have it all now.

176
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,655
I just-- I don't want you
to be unduly stressed.

177
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,490
I'm not stressed.

178
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,285
I miss being
on the trading floor with you,

179
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,122
all that adrenaline,
the highs of a filthy huge sale,

180
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,958
talking smack with the guys.

181
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,378
They called me
"The She-Wolf of Wall Street."

182
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,967
Wrap this one up for me, will you, doll?

183
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,095
He wants to put a dime on it?
With that spread?

184
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,723
Vinny, Vinny, Vinny.

185
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,518
-Hold on.
-I'm not letting you walk out of here

186
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,645
with this pathetic excuse
for an apology gift.

187
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,441
You know you're insulting
your own merchandise?

188
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,277
Not at all. You're looking
at off-the-rack items

189
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,406
when you committed a specialty-
showcase haute-couture offense.

190
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,034
Trust me on this one, Vinny.
You gotta go big.

191
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,786
Or your wife will never forgive you.

192
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,871
-T Dubs! How are you?
-Good, Ronnie.

193
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,374
Your tip took my portfolio
through the roof.

194
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,043
-You got the magic touch.
-I call them like I see them.

195
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,087
Oh, did Kendra like the bracelet?

196
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,090
-So about Kendra...
-Oh, T. Not again.

197
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,260
One second.

198
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,681
- Hey, stud.
- How's work, babe?

199
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,726
Great. Katy and I are
just a little slammed.

200
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,103
-You wanna meet us for dinner later?
-That's funny.

201
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,606
'Cause I went to Lacy's to surprise you,
and I'm standing next to Katy.

202
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,234
Hi, Katy. You, however,
are nowhere to be seen.

203
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,571
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing it is

204
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,656
not even knowing where my wife is?

205
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,577
Forget that you've been lying to me.
What happened to Lacy's?

206
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,996
-We decided you would work--
-I tried Lacy's,

207
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,915
but I needed something
with a little more edge.

208
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,251
-We were working towards having a baby.
-Oh, my...

209
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,587
-Or did you forget that?
-No. No, Chad.

210
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,589
You forgot. You forgot who I am.

211
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,090
Who you married.

212
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,890
Remember how it was in the beginning?

213
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,311
Things were so good.

214
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,272
You and me working side by side.

215
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,399
We were the power couple to beat.

216
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,401
And the sex?

217
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,405
The sex was amazing.

218
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,701
What happened?

219
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,412
The accident.

220
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,207
Chad...

221
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,170
you use the accident as an excuse
to try and control me...

222
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,713
-You almost died.
-So did you!

223
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,882
You didn't want me
going back to Wall Street

224
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,717
because it was too stressful,

225
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,096
and I didn't wanna keep having
the same argument, so I agreed.

226
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,723
But that was a mistake.
That's not who I am.

227
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,143
And the sooner you accept that,
the better off you'll be.

228
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,611
Ready, everyone.

229
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:34,905
And action!

230
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,282
From small town to big city,

231
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,452
my killer instinct always
gets me what I want.

232
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,164
And cut!

233
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,084
Oh, Hermione, my one-take wonder.

234
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,211
-You're my angel, you know that?
-Thank you.

235
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,464
-I wish all the Housewives could be you.
-Well, I try.

236
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,804
Wow, Mom. You make it look so easy.

237
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,849
Oh, please. For women who've been
through what we've been through?

238
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,475
This is a cake walk, mija.

239
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,396
Which reminds me, Andy wants to know
when you'll join us for an episode or two.

240
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,148
Mom, no.

241
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:13,610
I can't put my life on display.
Especially not when it's in utter turmoil.

242
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,945
What's wrong?

243
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,574
You're married to a successful man
who gives you whatever you want.

244
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,325
You don't even have to work.

245
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,870
I love working, that's the problem.

246
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,873
Chad wants to turn me
into a baby-making machine.

247
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,208
You don't wanna have kids? Since when?

248
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,835
We have plenty of time for that.

249
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,629
Right now? I don't wanna be a mom.

250
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,089
No offense.

251
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,301
I wanna be the She-Wolf of Wall Street.

252
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,886
Let me ask you something.

253
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:43,056
When you and Chad worked together,
you outperformed him. Right?

254
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,474
Almost every week.

255
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,477
Okay. That's threatening
to an alpha like Chad.

256
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,938
He's vain. Like Hiram.

257
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,815
Every marriage has its ups and downs.

258
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,110
And as for believing that you have
plenty of time to start a family?

259
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,072
I think the accident might have
shown you that's not the case.

260
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,515
Let's try this again.

261
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,939
Happy anniversary.

262
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,983
Happy anniversary.

263
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,569
I hate it when we fight.

264
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,155
Especially when it's my fault.

265
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,407
We never used to.

266
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,992
What happened?

267
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,787
The accident.

268
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,833
When our helicopter went down
on the way to Marcia's Vineyard...

269
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,045
I said a prayer, Veronica.

270
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,340
"If only one of us will survive,"
I thought...

271
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,468
"Please let it be my wife.

272
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,221
Let it be the woman
I wanna build a life with.

273
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,641
The woman I wanna be
the mother of my children."

274
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,062
We both survived, and all I could think
is now we can do those things.

275
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,855
I don't wanna waste a minute.

276
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,027
Does that make any sense to you at all?

277
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,239
It does.

278
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,576
But we're partners.

279
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,955
If I tell you that I wanna do something

280
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,750
and that I can handle
the stress of that thing...

281
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,462
you have to trust me, Chad.

282
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,257
I will.

283
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,359
Hold on.

284
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,777
You...

285
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,655
have got to open your gift first.

286
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,247
A new one comes out each year,
so you can start collecting them.

287
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:22,424
Well, Yvonne, I can see
that Josh was absolutely right about you.

288
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,677
-You are a woman of exquisite taste.
-Yes, I am.

289
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,554
I think I have just the thing.

290
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:34,186
We usually don't carry items
that are so high-end.

291
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,605
But I know a guy.

292
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,983
Best of all, a new Glamergé egg
is released each year.

293
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,777
You could start a collection.

294
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,819
Oh, my God.

295
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,655
It's perfect.

296
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,580
Archie?

297
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,665
Is everything okay?

298
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,998
What the hell, Jones?

299
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,000
- Hey, Samm Pansky, please.
- Hey.

300
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,752
-Hey.
-Jess, please.

301
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,170
Samm, it's me. Can we talk?

302
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,257
You'd rather talk to your agent
than your girlfriend? That's awesome.

303
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,510
Uh, can we meet for lunch
at that place you like?

304
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,345
Yeah. Great. I'll see you soon. Bye.

305
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,473
I have writer's block.

306
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,393
So do I. But I'm not punishing you for it.

307
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,436
Can we talk about this when I get back?

308
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,942
Samm, just give it to me straight.

309
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,195
Am I still in the running for
the staff writer job at The New Yorker?

310
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,282
No, kid. I'm sorry.
Just found out this morning.

311
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,076
You shouldn't be trying
to get a job as a reporter.

312
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,037
You're a fiction writer.
You should be working on your book.

313
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,455
How's that going, by the way?

314
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,625
I have writer's block.

315
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,171
You got a lousy work ethic
and a toxic relationship.

316
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,505
You drink too much.

317
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,716
So did Kerouac
and Hemmingway and Fitzgerald.

318
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,050
You want it straight?

319
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,429
Whatever heat you had coming off
of your first book is long gone.

320
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,390
A year ago, you could've had
a story published anywhere,

321
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,143
but now you're spoiled goods,
past your sell-by date.

322
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,352
Just need more time.

323
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,232
Scribner's called. They're threatening
to take back their advance.

324
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,651
-Did you hold them off?
-They wanna see pages!

325
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:50,071
It all comes down to, do you want a career
or be a one-hit wonder?

326
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,118
I can't hear you!

327
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,299
What?

328
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,303
Hey. Hey, Jess!

329
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,013
Did you see this?

330
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,515
Did--?

331
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,186
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
-I'll stay with Hailey.

332
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,313
-Why?
-This isn't working anymore.

333
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,982
We haven't been working for a long time.

334
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,693
Also, debt collectors are pounding
at the door.

335
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,736
Wait. When?

336
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,073
Today. After you blew me off
to meet with your agent.

337
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,033
Okay. Jess, please, wait--

338
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,785
Don't do this. All I need is just--

339
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,746
I don't know what you need, Jones.

340
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,957
But I'm definitely not it.

341
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:47,128
Good luck with your book.
It's the only thing you care about anyway.

342
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,732
Excuse me. This is you, isn't it?

343
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,237
It is you. Oh, my God.

344
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,323
I was sitting there,
reading your book, then I look up,

345
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,491
and there you are.

346
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,786
"Forsythe Pendleton Jones III."

347
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,872
-My friends just call me Jughead.
-Cora.

348
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,002
I'm a grad student at NYU.
English, of course.

349
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,258
It's wonderful, by the way. Your book.

350
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,468
The Outcasts, which is an homage--

351
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,096
To The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton.

352
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,099
The love story between the Viper leader
and the homecoming queen?

353
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,392
It's just so...

354
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,312
Romantic?

355
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,232
Sexy. I was gonna say.

356
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,111
It's a very sexy book.

357
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,687
-Morning.
-Morning.

358
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,482
Where'd you get that?

359
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,443
In one of your drawers. Is that okay?

360
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,614
Yeah. Not a big deal.
There's coffee brewing.

361
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,872
Hey, I remember this.

362
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,041
New York Magazine, right?

363
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,211
-They called you the--
-"New Brat Pack," yeah.

364
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,588
"The wunderkinds."

365
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,674
"The season's best
and brightest young writers

366
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,301
with so much potential."

367
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:05,475
Full disclosure, I've read the article
like a hundred times.

368
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,186
It's how I knew that bar was--

369
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,689
Is your usual hangout.

370
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,483
What?

371
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,778
Okay, so I really am a fan
of your book. Honestly.

372
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,740
But I do have an ulterior motive.

373
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,167
Would you mind reading my novel?

374
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:35,463
It's 342 pages. If you like it,
maybe you could give it to your agent?

375
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,132
Okay. Hold on.

376
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,471
Last night was a ploy
to get me to read your book?

377
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,603
Forsythe Jones, open up!

378
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,647
Who are they?

379
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,359
-Debt collectors.
-Are they gonna hurt you?

380
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,903
Jones, we know you're in there.
We can see your shadow.

381
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,532
-We can hear you shuffling. Let's go.
-I'll read your book, I swear.

382
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,909
Could you just do me a favor?

383
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,786
- Not going anywhere, Jones.
- Please?

384
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,458
-Can I help you?
-Where's Forsythe Jones?

385
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,461
Uh, he's not here.
I'm apartment-sitting for him.

386
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,797
He got a job writing in L.A.,
just left this morning.

387
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,258
Can I give him a message for you?

388
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,761
Tell him to call us. It's urgent.

389
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,888
You got it.

390
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,055
Will do.

391
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:33,897
Thank you.

392
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,025
No problem. But I'll expect to hear
from you by the end of the week.

393
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,860
-The end of the week?
-About my novel?

394
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,029
And about giving it to your agent?

395
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,822
And if I don't hear from you,

396
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,325
I know who I'm gonna call.

397
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,150
This is nuts. I haven't
seen you guys in, what, six years?

398
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,485
It's been seven.

399
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,322
Wow. Lots of catching up to do.

400
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:28,701
I had a job lined up after graduation
with Riverdale Social Services,

401
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,829
but their offices got shut down.

402
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,540
Lucky for her, we needed
a counselor at Riverdale High.

403
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,291
You're looking at the new Mrs. Burble.

404
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,336
Wait. You're working
at Riverdale High too, Kev?

405
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,255
Yep. Drama teacher.

406
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,466
Got my BA from Carnegie Mellon
in Pittsburgh, where...

407
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,636
I graduated
from the University of Pittsburgh.

408
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,724
We stayed boyfriends, believe it or not.

409
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,060
And now we live together here.

410
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,813
With me. In an apartment
on Cloverfield Lane.

411
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,648
That's amazing.

412
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,149
Sweet Pea, what about you, bro?

413
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,819
Mostly held down the fort here
while these guys were gone.

414
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,279
Then, when Toni got back...

415
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,574
We decided to revive the Serpents.
Under my leadership.

416
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,117
I was crowned the Serpent Queen.

417
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,452
Well, I gotta say, this place is sick.

418
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,956
Pulls in a different crowd though.
What's with the truckers?

419
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,208
Serpents drive trucks,
including me and Fangs.

420
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,960
- Toni had the hookup.
- Impressive.

421
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,129
Hey, what about Cheryl?

422
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,135
It's cool, guys.

423
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,680
-After graduation, Cheryl and I broke up.
-RIP, Choni.

424
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:35,310
After I got back from Highsmith,
I went to check on her a couple times...

425
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,103
Hello, Antoinette.

426
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,980
Cheryl.

427
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,691
I thought we could talk.

428
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,484
I'm afraid now isn't a good time.

429
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,030
We're in the midst
of renovating Thornhill.

430
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,491
And I've got my painting to finish.
Perhaps another day?

431
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,703
Uh... Sure.

432
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,873
Cheryl, are you okay?

433
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:03,046
I'm perfectly fine.
Do I appear to be otherwise?

434
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,548
My mistake.

435
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,188
And? Did you go back?

436
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,732
I did. Not too long ago.

437
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,777
But this time,
I wasn't Thornhill's only visitor.

438
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,571
Hiram was there
with his right-hand man Reggie.

439
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,615
Reggie's working for Hiram Lodge?

440
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:35,161
I will never sell you
my maple groves, you vulgarian.

441
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,080
Nana and I plan to be buried
amongst those trees.

442
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:41,292
-We could make that happen.
-Goodbye, would-be usurper.

443
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,010
-Business with Hiram Lodge?
-No.

444
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:55,223
He comes by every other week,
offering to buy my maple groves, but...

445
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,309
I'm really glad to see you, Toni.

446
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:02,689
I wonder if you would do me
the honor of letting me paint you.

447
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,114
Cheryl, no one's seen you
in town in years.

448
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,907
Don't worry about me.

449
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,909
Nana and I are just fine.

450
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,954
-There's no reason for us to leave.
-Okay.

451
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,374
Well, don't you wanna hear about me?

452
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,417
Let's see.

453
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,336
You graduated with a 3.9 GPA.

454
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,880
You majored in social work
with a minor in photography.

455
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,717
And you did extensive charity
and social work.

456
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,844
Am I missing anything important?

457
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,763
Well, other than the fact
I'm having a baby.

458
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,433
I'd heard that, yes.

459
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,311
Congratulations, Toni.

460
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,772
I won't ask who the father is.

461
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,483
I'm completely out
and open with my family.

462
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,985
We've talked about you.

463
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,196
They recognize and acknowledge
everything you've done

464
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,407
to make up for your ancestors' sins.

465
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,828
I think that they'd approve
of us being together.

466
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,167
I'm so happy to hear that, Toni.

467
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,628
But it's not nearly enough.

468
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:12,133
The Blossom curse runs deep.
I'm doomed to a life of unhappiness.

469
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,052
You think you're cursed.

470
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,180
Beloved Tee-Tee...

471
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,726
are you familiar
with the Winchester House?

472
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,103
I've seen the movie with Helen Mirren.

473
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:27,899
Sarah Winchester came
from a family of rifle-makers.

474
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,567
Winchester rifles.

475
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,527
One by one,

476
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:35,448
family members suffered
painful, horrific fates.

477
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:40,870
Cursed by the deaths brought on
by their family's stock and trade, rifles.

478
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,414
Only Sarah survived.

479
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,626
So she started to build a house.

480
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,837
The Winchester House.

481
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:55,176
She believed that as long as it remained
under constant construction...

482
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,763
the curse couldn't consume her.

483
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,099
Is that why you're rebuilding Thornhill?

484
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:04,977
Toni...

485
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,064
I'm glad you're doing so well.

486
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,900
You deserve to be happy.

487
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,201
She didn't say another word.

488
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,370
She just painted me for 12 hours,

489
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,372
and when she was done, I left.

490
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,834
A week later, a package showed up,
and it was my portrait.

491
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,132
She didn't keep it as a reminder
of what you guys had?

492
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,842
I guess she didn't want it.

493
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,720
Well done, my dear.

494
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,182
It's exactly like the original.

495
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,228
It's a perfect copy.

496
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,856
You've learned well.

497
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,693
Now, the question is...

498
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,406
would you be able to replicate
the work of a master?

499
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,783
Like, say, um...

500
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,493
Rembrandt?

501
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,501
Toni, earlier you said
the town had changed.

502
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,421
I'll regret asking this,
but can you tell me how?

503
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,341
-I think it might be better to show you.
-Okay.

504
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,467
Where are you staying?

505
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,512
I'm crashing at the El Royale.
My mom's renting out our house.

506
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,555
Right.

507
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,183
The renters. Um...

508
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,186
-I'll pick you up at the gym.
-Okay. Thanks, Toni.

509
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,272
-You mind if I stay to make a few calls?
-Go for it.

510
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,834
- Archie?
- Toni.

511
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,087
I figured a steel gate would be enough
to keep this gym intact,

512
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,048
but this place is like a war zone.

513
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:00,301
Wait till you see the rest of the town.
Come on, my bike's out front.

514
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,351
This was the fire station,
remember?

515
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,103
It was a burnt-up shell
when I got back from college.

516
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,772
No one's trying to rebuild it?

517
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,358
The town's funding has been stripped by--

518
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,235
-Hiram Lodge.
-Bingo.

519
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,070
Not only is the fire department gone,

520
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,198
but the Sheriff's Office is down
to one man, Kevin's dad.

521
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,325
I don't understand. What are people doing?

522
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,536
Fending for themselves?
The town's lawless now.

523
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,125
This was Pickens Park.

524
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,925
Where is everybody?

525
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,011
Whoever could afford
to leave is long gone.

526
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,224
Only the people who are too poor
or too proud to move on are still here.

527
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,772
This was Sketch Alley.

528
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,483
Now we just call it what it is. Skid row.

529
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,611
Those dogs are everywhere. Packs of them.

530
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,196
Some are rabid.

531
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,335
This is the fifth bus stop
that's been trashed, melted.

532
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,545
Five of dozens.

533
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,755
There's always a fire
burning in Riverdale.

534
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,883
Why burn a bench for no reason?
Where will people sit for the bus?

535
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,137
That's the thing.
Buses don't pass by here anymore.

536
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,431
Sometimes, my trucks do,

537
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,142
but only if they have to
and rarely at night.

538
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,811
Bad things happen here after dark.

539
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,147
They call this the Lonely Highway.

540
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,358
Why destroy an entire town for nothing?

541
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,487
-What does Hiram Lodge have to gain?
-I'll show you.

542
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:55,458
-I don't get it. Where are the houses?
-This isn't SoDale proper.

543
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,419
This is where Hiram's building
a turnpike that leads to SoDale,

544
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,588
about half a mile due east.

545
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,507
He's catering to the rich folk
who can commute into the city.

546
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,427
So he's strangling Riverdale
to boost SoDale?

547
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,013
Their kids will go to SoDale High?

548
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,682
Stonewall Prep. That place is the same.

549
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,726
Except Hiram bought a seat on the board.

550
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,895
And so the nightmare continues.

551
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:20,232
There's one more place
I think you should see on the tour.

552
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,777
But you'll have to brace yourself.

553
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,699
The Ghoulies moved into my house?

554
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,788
-Wanna go in there and knock some heads?
-As a matter of fact, I do.

555
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,166
First things first, Toni.
Can we go back to Pop's?

556
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,710
-See if any of them actually came?
-Okay.

557
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,426
Archie. I heard you were back.

558
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,429
Pop. It's good to see you. I missed you.

559
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,765
Same. I missed all of you.

560
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,114
Archie. Toni.

561
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,323
Veronica.

562
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,117
-Betty. Jughead.
-Hi.

563
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,744
I'll leave you guys to it, then.

564
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,414
No. You're as much
a part of this as any of us.

565
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,753
Look, guys.

566
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,840
Toni gave me a tour
of Riverdale today and it's--

567
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,717
It's a hellscape.

568
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,929
I know I called you here
for Pop's retirement party...

569
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,348
but we have a much bigger agenda now.

570
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,933
Riverdale's dying.

571
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,311
We might be the only ones who can save it.

572
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,577
Are you sure
I can't convince you to stay, Squeaky?

573
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,579
I'll give you more shifts
if it would help.

574
00:40:56,662 --> 00:41:00,958
I appreciate that, Tabitha,
but Riverdale is done with me.

575
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,210
And I am done with Riverdale.

576
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,254
Well, take care of yourself.

577
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,547
Will do.

578
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,396
Her name is Lynette Fields.

579
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,357
"Squeaky" to her friends,
not that she has many.

580
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,151
Mostly, she keeps to herself.

581
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:31,989
She came to Riverdale two years ago
for a fresh start that never happened.

582
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,451
Now she was 21, and it was time to go.

583
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,121
"Maybe things will be different
in San Francisco," she thought.

584
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,915
"Maybe I'll be happy there."

585
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,125
Unfortunately for Lynette,

586
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,461
she'll never make it to California.
