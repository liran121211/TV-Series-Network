1
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,353
Min-Min. You made it.

2
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,784
I've alerted the auction house
of my whereabouts,

3
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,163
so if you're sacrificing me
to your crimson gods, don't.

4
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,957
First of all, they're goddesses,

5
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,336
and I would never dream
of doing such a thing to you, pet.

6
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,214
Consider this evening an apology.

7
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,551
You said over the phone
you finished a new series of paintings.

8
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,094
That's the only reason I'm here.

9
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,514
Let's get to it then.

10
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,356
Welcome to my little Night Gallery,
I like to call it.

11
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,527
Where the depths
of the human psyche are plumbed,

12
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,530
and all manner of nightmares
are summoned up and bound to canvas.

13
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,742
I'm sensing Goya, Dali, Bacon.

14
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,660
My heroes.

15
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,996
Tell me about this one.

16
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,123
Ah, yes.

17
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,293
It's about a hero,

18
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,714
haunted by his past and plagued
by the trauma of his present.

19
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,223
Uh, my nightmares have...

20
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,518
been so vivid, Dr. Winters.

21
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,562
But confusing too. I mean, everything's...

22
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:47,982
jumbled up.

23
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,736
That's your subconscious trying
to make sense of the senseless.

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,032
Your anxiety is normal,
given the trauma you went through.

25
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,743
We can get it under control
with anti-anxiety medication.

26
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,037
No, no, no. No pills.

27
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,664
Okay. No pills.

28
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:08,002
You know, there are other ways
of dealing with anxiety, like EMDR.

29
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,381
Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprogramming.

30
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,425
Tell the story of what happened to you

31
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,221
while I move my hand
back and forth like this.

32
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,557
You follow my fingers with your eyes,

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,351
so that as you remember,
your body stays in the present.

34
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,270
Should we try it?

35
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,988
Private Butler.

36
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,616
We called him Bingo.

37
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,332
I...

38
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,548
I let him die.

39
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,761
He was caught in no-man's-land.

40
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,475
I was in a foxhole with Jackson,
who was bleeding out.

41
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,610
Repetition takes power away
from the memory.

42
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,820
Tell me the story again.

43
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,410
I gotta admit, you were right
about Dr. Winters, Eric.

44
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,870
She's a miracle worker.

45
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,580
You do an EMDR with her?

46
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,875
Doc's got me on this drug regimen.
Meds will help with the nerve pain.

47
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,544
- What about side effects?
- Nothing serious.

48
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,802
No.

49
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,932
Gentlemen, I've only recently learned

50
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,601
what everyone else in town seems
to have known for weeks,

51
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,103
if not months, that, allegedly,

52
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:53,524
the largest deposit of palladium on
this continent is beneath my maple groves.

53
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,737
Which is why I need a team of brawny,
strong men to reopen my mines

54
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,657
and harvest the precious metal
before Hiram Lodge steals it.

55
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,494
So, naturally, I thought of you
and, um, Andrews Construction.

56
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,746
I don't have any experience mining.

57
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,833
Archie, you've been a soldier,
a fireman, a football coach,

58
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,752
a teacher, and a bounty hunter?

59
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,588
Is a miner so far outside your purview?

60
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,425
Opening existing mines is doable.
I ran a crew in Alaska for a spell.

61
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,972
Okay. Count us in.

62
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,601
We'll set up one of my dad's old trailers
and run the whole operation from there.

63
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,852
Perfection.

64
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,938
And can you start immediately?

65
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,109
Ready to do this?

66
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,736
Yeah. I can smell the palladium from here.

67
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,615
Halt. Before you go forth, I would like
to offer my blessing as ministress.

68
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,201
Gather round and join hands.

69
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,745
You know, uh...

70
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,416
- I'm not religious.
- Keep an open mind.

71
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,754
To our Brother Divine,
in entering this dark cavity,

72
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,466
help keep our strapping muck-men safe
from harm and danger,

73
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,347
and let their great labors lead
to even greater riches.

74
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,141
- Amen!
- Amen!

75
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,224
Amen.

76
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,311
All right. In you go.

77
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,573
You okay, Andrews?

78
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,034
Yeah.

79
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,828
Yeah, let's do this.

80
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,175
- Where's Kev?
- He wasn't hungry,

81
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,968
- so he kept on digging.
- What?

82
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,472
No. No one works in the mines alone.

83
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,270
Kevin!

84
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,109
Kev, are you in here?

85
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,113
Kev!

86
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,117
Kev!

87
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,763
- Archie.
- Kevin, you can't stay back alone!

88
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,846
Look what I found.

89
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,689
It's a maple miracle.

90
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,526
Well done, Archie.

91
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,737
I'd suggest a celebratory toast,
but you have to get right back to it.

92
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,163
Another good session, Archie.

93
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,833
Dr. Winters,

94
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,796
if I agreed
to take some drugs for my PTSD,

95
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,632
what would you prescribe me?

96
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,677
A low dose of anti-anxiety medication,
as we discussed.

97
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,973
- Why? Did something happen?
- A crazy flashback.

98
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,309
I have a crew depending on me now,
so I can't get squirrely on them.

99
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,230
These will help.

100
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,659
Have you guys ever heard of the Mothmen?

101
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,287
Yeah. Jug was investigating them.

102
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,915
I saw his sketches,
but they're just a hoax, right?

103
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:38,999
Maybe.

104
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,880
There were some stories
from the truck drivers

105
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,923
who worked in the mines
when they were open.

106
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,509
And every so often,

107
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,012
they'd talk about these...

108
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,974
humanoid creatures that lived underground.

109
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,144
With big red eyes.

110
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:03,399
To absorb as much light as possible.
Not to mention they were cannibalistic.

111
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,944
Okay. Enough storytelling.
Get back to work.

112
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,917
Archie!

113
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,341
Help me, sarge!

114
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,599
Eric!

115
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,768
Eric?

116
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,812
Eric, you okay, buddy?

117
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,356
Eric?

118
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,987
Hey. Are you okay?

119
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,824
Archie? You okay?

120
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,077
You ran out like a bat out of hell.

121
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,955
- I'm fine. I had to get out of there.
- What happened?

122
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,499
I'm fine, Uncle Frank.

123
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,586
Someone's messing with me.

124
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,839
Someone's messing with my head!

125
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,926
What were those pills?

126
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,053
Sergeant Andrews,
you can't burst in here...

127
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,973
What were those pills you gave me?
Huh? Psychotics?

128
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,016
Hallucinogenics? LSD?

129
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,312
Whatever drugs she wants you to take,
don't. She's experimenting on us!

130
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,481
Who do you even work for?
Who do you work for?

131
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,193
Some government corporation?
Let me guess. It's Hiram Lodge.

132
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,820
The rum-maker?

133
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,822
I don't even know that man.

134
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,534
- Leave or I'm gonna call security.
- No. What were those pills?

135
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,495
You heard the doc.

136
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,205
Fine.

137
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,332
I'm gone.

138
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,214
- Jackson!
- Yo.

139
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,298
Jackson.

140
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,261
Stop seeing Dr. Winters.
Okay? She's dangerous.

141
00:09:56,137 --> 00:10:00,349
- What are you talking about?
- Listen, she's using us as guinea pigs.

142
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,062
With all due respect,
I'm not gonna stop seeing Dr. Winters.

143
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,609
I don't think you should either.
You got a lot of baggage.

144
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,943
More than you let on.

145
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,778
Losing that many men?

146
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,989
That's not easy.

147
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm surprised it didn't break you.

148
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,468
Hey, there he is.

149
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,178
Hey. Uncle Frank.

150
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,723
Uh, hey, listen.
Me and the guys were talking, and...

151
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,977
we think you should take the day off.
Rest up. Take your mind off things.

152
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,481
I'm not taking Dr. Winter's meds anymore.

153
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,399
They should be flushed out of my system.

154
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,235
Yeah. I don't think
you should go underground.

155
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,199
You could get caught up on the payroll,
so we don't fall behind.

156
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:02,787
- We'll come back and have lunch together.
- Yeah, yeah. Cool. Sounds good.

157
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,914
Great. Okay.

158
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,853
Uncle Frank!

159
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,481
Kevin!

160
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:32,942
Uncle Frank?

161
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,986
He loves me. He loves me not.

162
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,656
- Kevin.
- He loves me. He loves me not.

163
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,699
- He loves me.
- Archie!

164
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,701
- He loves me.
- Archie?

165
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,704
- Can you hear them? Can you hear them?
- Hear what?

166
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,166
The Tommy-knockers singing in my head!

167
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,918
Fangs, listen. Look at me.

168
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,712
There's monsters! There's monsters here!

169
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,006
Reggie! Reggie! Reggie! Look at me!

170
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,510
Take Kevin and Fangs,
get them out of here. Okay?

171
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,887
Take Kevin and Fangs,
get them out of here.

172
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,097
Okay.

173
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
Go! Go!

174
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,897
- Uncle Frank!
- You are a devil.

175
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,650
- And all devils go to hell!
- Eric! Stop! Eric!

176
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,778
Stop it. Eric! I'm not your enemy.

177
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,322
Yeah. You are. You're the devil!

178
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,740
No. I'm not!

179
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,831
- Uncle Frank, you okay?
- Yeah.

180
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,667
- What is going on down here?
- Gas. It's gas.

181
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,878
We gotta get everyone topside ASAP.

182
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,174
I wanna hear it from the horses' mouths.

183
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,051
What happened to your crew?
Why has the digging stopped?

184
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,470
It's not safe to work.

185
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:47,016
Given the state of delirium of the men,
those tunnels are full of carbon monoxide.

186
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,939
It's odorless,
and if you breathe enough of it,

187
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,020
it causes hallucinations,
violent outbursts.

188
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,148
Which all of us have been experiencing
to greater or less degrees.

189
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,525
That's annoying. How do we fix it?

190
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,213
We can hook up a pump
to make sure there's fresh air.

191
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,322
Yes! Do that.

192
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,782
And I'll order a flock of canaries.

193
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,784
But I want you back in there digging ASAP.

194
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,581
What are you doing here?

195
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,666
Dr. Winters, please.

196
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,920
It turns out I was suffering the effects
of carbon monoxide poisoning.

197
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,714
But I took my aggression out on you
and for that I'm sorry.

198
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:24,386
Don't cut me loose. I need help.
I haven't told you this, a lot of men...

199
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,391
A lot of men died under my command.

200
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,604
I started seeing one of them,
Private Bingo, but now I...

201
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,030
Now I'm seeing all of them.

202
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,992
I don't know
what you want me to say, Archie.

203
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,331
I'm scared to be alone with you
after how you came in here last time.

204
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,500
And if you're experiencing

205
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,670
such an extreme level
of hallucination, then...

206
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,840
I don't think it's safe for you
to be around anyone.

207
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,644
These paintings, Cheryl,

208
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,938
their subject matter is somehow...

209
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,982
more haunted than before.

210
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,067
Thank you, Minerva.

211
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,528
My God.

212
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,697
Inspired by my poor, dear cousin.

213
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,577
Wrestling with the question:
"Who is the true monster,

214
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,080
the ghoul our girl is hunting
or the girl herself?"

215
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,757
I am not as used to this
as you are.

216
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,052
But we just caught a man
who might be the Highway Killer.

217
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,930
Are you sure we shouldn't
hand him over to the authorities?

218
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,809
No. If we do that,
I could get cut out of the investigation.

219
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,311
He might have killed Polly.

220
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,605
I know I can get
that information out of him.

221
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,981
It is what I do.

222
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,278
But I think it's time
you bow out, Tabitha.

223
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,238
Just let me handle this, okay?

224
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,282
- Wait, are you serious?
- Deadly.

225
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,910
Please trust me.

226
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,620
Okay.

227
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,124
But if at any point you need backup,

228
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,001
I'm here.

229
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:23,631
I don't want any other girls dying
and that includes you.

230
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,009
Yeah.

231
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,482
Hi. I'm Betty.

232
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,777
What's your name?

233
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,404
Martin.

234
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,494
No, it's not. That's not your name.

235
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,789
That's the name on the driver's license
you've been carrying around.

236
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,209
But the real Martin Tucker died
almost, mmm, 50 years ago?

237
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,338
I'm with the FBI.
So you should really start telling me...

238
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,509
about the women you've killed
along the Lonely Highway.

239
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:10,928
All of them.

240
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,805
If you're with the FBI,

241
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,016
then why am I in some shop class

242
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,810
instead of in jail right now?

243
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,603
I want a phone call.

244
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,814
I am a citizen of the United States.

245
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:22,982
I have rights.

246
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:27,444
Mm-hm. Yeah. Well, actually, you're not
in the United States anymore.

247
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,448
You're in Riverdale.

248
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,866
Welcome.

249
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:38,831
And killers of women do not have rights.

250
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,167
And if you're thinking
of yelling for help,

251
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,878
it's a long weekend.

252
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,380
Let me guess.

253
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,592
You're one of those women
who runs around entrapping men,

254
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,011
gets off on it.

255
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,846
Who hurt you?

256
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,306
A bitter boyfriend?

257
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,898
Okay. Well, I'll be back.

258
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,861
Maybe next time we can have
a more fruitful conversation.

259
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:09,987
If not...

260
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,741
guess I'll just have to get creative.

261
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,757
Mary-Catherine Avery,

262
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,136
last seen two years ago
waiting tables at a diner in Seaside.

263
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,682
Nicole Houston, missing a year ago
while hitchhiking to Canada.

264
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,484
Polly Cooper, last seen this past summer.

265
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,534
Hmm, I thought I recognized her
for a second, but, no, I was mistaken.

266
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,414
Alison McCall.

267
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,377
It's been a minute,
but I never forget a face that pretty.

268
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,963
Where is she?

269
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,551
An old hiker's trail
in the northeast corner of Swedlow Swamp.

270
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,262
She's underneath a gorgeous sycamore tree.

271
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,014
You just gotta dig!

272
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,560
So did you find her?
She's a real bitch, isn't she?

273
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,563
They're dog bones, you psychopath.

274
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,940
Oh, right.

275
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,943
That's where I buried my old dog
after she passed away.

276
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,528
Poor little thing.

277
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,280
Sorry about the confusion, Agent Cooper.

278
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,950
How do you know my name?

279
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,869
There's been stories
up and down the highway

280
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,998
about some crazy, rogue FBI agent
out looking for her sister.

281
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,710
Polly. Where is she?

282
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:53,423
If I knew and if I told you,
you'd be like every other woman,

283
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,176
casting me aside
after getting what you want!

284
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,052
Fine.

285
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,267
Let's talk about something else.

286
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,727
Why did you start doing this?

287
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,439
- I wanted to see how it would feel?
- And?

288
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,988
- How does it feel?
- No different from hunting with my family.

289
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,448
These... Uh...

290
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,619
These people that you're hunting...

291
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,581
aren't animals.

292
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,459
They're human beings with families.

293
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,503
No, they're just prey.

294
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,131
That's how I see it.

295
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,101
Mom?

296
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,355
I have to tell you something.

297
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,232
What is it, honey?

298
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,905
I... captured a trucker.

299
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,075
I think he's the man
who may have killed Polly.

300
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,912
The man who's been killing
the young women on the highway.

301
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,371
Oh, my God.

302
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:12,002
One thing serial killers do...

303
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,881
is dehumanize their victims
before killing them.

304
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,301
It's risky, Mom,
but I believe that if he saw you...

305
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,847
really saw you as a grieving mother

306
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,016
and Polly as a human being...

307
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,230
he might confess.

308
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,107
There's no guarantees but maybe...

309
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,901
I'll do it.

310
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,487
Okay. Good.

311
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,616
Okay.

312
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,247
I wanna tell you
about my daughter, Polly.

313
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,043
This was her at 10 years old.

314
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,212
My little golden girl.

315
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,927
She loved to dance and swim.

316
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,138
She was a baton-twirler.

317
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:10,352
You can't imagine
what it's like to be a mother

318
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,106
that has no idea where her child is.

319
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,236
Your...?

320
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,283
- Your daughter?
- Yeah?

321
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,538
Your daughter squealed like a pig
when I slit her throat.

322
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,832
You monster!

323
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,626
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

324
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,711
Hey, hey.

325
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,629
- Please.
- No!

326
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,465
Stop it.

327
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,846
We're not getting through to him.

328
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,431
Have to push harder.

329
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,350
Okay, appealing
to his humanity didn't work.

330
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,523
But maybe if he believed
that he was actually going to die,

331
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,899
maybe then he would talk.

332
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,360
Why don't you just kill him, Betty?

333
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,738
Mom, come on.

334
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,744
- That scumbag killed my daughter.
- It's not gonna make you feel any better.

335
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,163
I'll feel better knowing
that my daughter's killer's dead.

336
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,332
So do it, Betty.

337
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,127
As your mother, I give you permission.

338
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,588
Kill that monster.

339
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,011
I wanna try one more thing first.

340
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,933
I know my sister's dead.

341
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,312
I've accepted that.

342
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:40,567
So I'm asking you one more time
to tell me where Polly is.

343
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,154
Please.

344
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:47,240
There's no earthly reason
for me to do that.

345
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,411
Okay, then.

346
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,293
Here's what's gonna happen next.

347
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,839
I'm not gonna kill you
because I want you to suffer.

348
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,507
So...

349
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,928
I'm gonna start carving pieces off of you.

350
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,891
First, I'll use a chain saw on your feet.

351
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,812
I'll cut them off at the ankles
and then cauterize the wounds.

352
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,233
And then I'll cut off your legs
at the knees...

353
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,944
cauterize those wounds.

354
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,030
And then your upper legs at the groin.

355
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,409
And then I'll move on to your hands,
sever them at the wrists.

356
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,913
And by that point, you might die
of a heart attack, but I don't know.

357
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,667
You seem pretty strong.

358
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,628
And I have a couple tricks up my sleeve.

359
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,715
Wait. Okay, wait.

360
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:55,433
Did your sister have blue eyes
and a tattoo of the infinity symbol?

361
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,187
And did she ever go
by the name "Patty" instead of "Polly"?

362
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:02,898
Yeah.

363
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,862
Do you remember her?

364
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,825
Not in the least.

365
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,756
Please. Just kill me.

366
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,384
Just kill me, please.

367
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,263
You tiny, pretty thing.

368
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,057
I'm not going to kill you.

369
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,561
I'm gonna carve pieces off of you.

370
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,149
First, I'll use a chain saw on your feet.

371
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,196
Then I'll cauterize the wounds.

372
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,511
So, Betty...

373
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,804
did you do it?

374
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,765
Nope.

375
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,393
But he did it himself.

376
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,229
Bit off his own tongue.

377
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,730
Swallowed it.

378
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,817
And choked to death on it.

379
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,737
Maybe he was afraid
of what I was gonna do to him,

380
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,615
or maybe he finally felt guilty
about what he'd done.

381
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:39,621
So he takes his secrets to the grave
and we're no closer to finding Polly.

382
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:43,166
We'll have to wait and see
what Dr. Curdle's autopsy report says.

383
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,627
Do you feel better?

384
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,588
Now that he's dead?

385
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,928
I do.
I think some lives were saved tonight.

386
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,722
Do you feel better?

387
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,558
Yeah.

388
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,311
But based on a few things he said,

389
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,356
my gut's telling me
that he's not the only killer.

390
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:11,403
I think maybe
there's a family of them hunting together.

391
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,834
My God.

392
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,919
It's remarkable, isn't it?

393
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,840
Portrait of a young writer caught
betwixt fact and fiction,

394
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,635
memory and madness, truth and trauma.

395
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,262
Interpret it for me.

396
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,267
Let's just say it's about the stories
we tell ourselves to survive.

397
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,769
And about addiction.

398
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,066
Would anyone new like
to start us off?

399
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,281
Uh... Yeah. Sure.

400
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:03,705
Uh, my name is
Forsythe Pendleton Jones III.

401
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,123
Welcome, Forsythe.

402
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:09,627
It's just kind of weird being in here
at night not as a teacher but as a...

403
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,214
An alcoholic.

404
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,718
We're happy to listen
to whatever you want to say.

405
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,764
I guess I'll start
with when I left Riverdale.

406
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,933
After high school,
I joined the Iowa Writers' Workshop.

407
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,436
I thought Iowa was gonna be an escape,

408
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,940
but in reality, my freshman year
was actually kind of boring.

409
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,611
So I focused on my craft.

410
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,573
Origins of storytelling stuff,
like Greek myths, Dostoyevsky,

411
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,241
The Sopranos.

412
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:46,206
And every afternoon at dusk,
I'd segue from coffee to whiskey.

413
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,624
And I'd start writing.

414
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,961
And from those late nights came
the first few chapters of a novel

415
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,172
and, I hoped, my ticket out of Iowa.

416
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,676
So I polished the pages and sent them off
to a hundred literary agents in New York.

417
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,429
And one got back to me.

418
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,934
A guy named Samm Pansky.
He was an old-school legend, and he wrote:

419
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:09,270
"Hey, kid. Drop me a line
next time you're in New York."

420
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,148
So I took Samm up on his offer.

421
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,069
Based on what I've read,

422
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,446
you got a lot of talent, kid.

423
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,242
I got you something.

424
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,372
- What's this for?
- What?

425
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,041
An agent can't get his client a gift?

426
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,376
Wait, are...?

427
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,213
I have an agent? Are you my agent?

428
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,925
Welcome to the Samm Pansky family.

429
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,593
Hey, Betty.

430
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,264
Oh, I'm surprised you picked up.

431
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:49,018
My roommate has some company over,
so I'm just killing time.

432
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,062
Yeah, that's rough.

433
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,358
I got an agent.

434
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,362
He signed me after reading
two chapters of my new novel.

435
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,072
Jug, that's huge.

436
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,323
Congratulations.

437
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,200
Please tell me your Iowa friends

438
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,786
are taking you out
for a celebratory drink.

439
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,915
Yeah, uh, they are but later.

440
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,711
And that night, I decided
that I was gonna move to New York City

441
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,421
and become a proper writer.

442
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,424
In my new apartment, in the East Village,

443
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,218
I was hit
with a lethal case of writer's block.

444
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:29,684
Luckily, my girlfriend, Jessica, knew
where to score some maple mushrooms.

445
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,769
- Do you have it?
- Yeah.

446
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,437
- Perfect. Oh, yeah.
- Hey.

447
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,529
When I was tripping on shrooms, it...

448
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,532
just felt like...

449
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:49,204
doors to my mind just swung right open.

450
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,040
I wrote 200 pages that night.

451
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,630
And from that crazy, raw first draft
came The Outcasts.

452
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,510
Well...

453
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,933
I think The Outcasts...

454
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,938
is gonna be a monster YA hit.

455
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:19,150
And let me tell you, YA is hot.
Which means moola. Lots of moola.

456
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:20,984
YA it is.

457
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:28,159
The year leading up to the publication
of the book was just a whirlwind.

458
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,620
I was drinking pretty steadily.

459
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:34,707
And though Jess had moved in,
I was still holding on to the past.

460
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,630
Or more specifically, my ex.

461
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,938
Spoiler alert.

462
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,566
It was not a great night. No.

463
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:04,946
It quickly began to derail
after I got a call from Betty...

464
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,947
All right. Bye.

465
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,326
...saying she wasn't going to be able
to make the book release after all.

466
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:19,252
Stumbling in the general direction
of my party, I called Betty,

467
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:24,299
and I left her just this crazy,
super-toxic voicemail.

468
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,925
Please leave a message.

469
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,927
Betty. Of course you bailed.

470
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,555
You've been blowing me off for years.

471
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,057
Why should I have even expected
anything different?

472
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:33,975
I see you, Betty.

473
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,268
I see now...

474
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,063
what I should have seen seven years ago.

475
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,232
You pretend to be nice...

476
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,233
but really...

477
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,237
you're looking for weak spots.

478
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,782
And when you find them,

479
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,828
you just press on them like a bruise.

480
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:58,833
Like when you hooked up with Archie,
you really found the one person...

481
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,420
...that would hurt
Veronica and I the most.

482
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,131
And you just went there.

483
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:09,385
You're a cold, fake, duplicitous bitch.

484
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:13,306
And when people read my book,
everyone is gonna see that.

485
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,858
And then...

486
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,736
I vanished.

487
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,197
I was swallowed up by the dark.

488
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:36,454
So "swallowed up by the dark,"
was that a metaphor?

489
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,622
No, I wish.

490
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,874
One moment
I was stumbling in a back alley,

491
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:45,338
and the next moment
I was waking up in a hospital room.

492
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Where am I?

493
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,392
Hey, hey.

494
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,519
You're okay.

495
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,856
You're at St. Vincent's.

496
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,276
You went on a bender, Jones.

497
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,194
An epic one.

498
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:10,863
The hell happened?

499
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,451
Actually, I don't wanna know.

500
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,288
- How long was I out?
- A few days.

501
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,124
Oh, my God.

502
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,628
Oh, I wish I could say
that that signaled a fresh start

503
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,297
for Jess and I but nope.

504
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,883
No, we kept on drinking
and fighting and...

505
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,969
Certainly not writing.

506
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,141
So when my old pal Archie Andrews
called out of the blue,

507
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,600
I came home.

508
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,935
Here. To Riverdale.

509
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,941
But something was still gnawing at me,
at my mind and my sanity.

510
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,527
And, uh, I was still drinking.

511
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,987
Heavily. Heavily.

512
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,532
And shortly after that, I hit rock bottom.

513
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,534
On skid row, no less.

514
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,746
Then I figured
I needed to go back to New York City.

515
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,583
Find out what happened to me
the night of my book release

516
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,960
when I lost those days of my life.

517
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,880
So I went back to St. Vincent's Hospital

518
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,007
and requested a copy
of my discharge records,

519
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,552
which said I had been treated
for a rabies infection.

520
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:15,803
So I went to see Jess.

521
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,387
Rabies.

522
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,099
What the hell happened? Jess.

523
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,059
Just tell me.

524
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,812
You disappeared the night of your party.

525
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,607
And three days later,
you ended up at St. Vincent's.

526
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,568
The doctors said when you came in,
you were out of your mind,

527
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,778
raving and ranting.

528
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,779
About what?

529
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,364
She told me that I had been...

530
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,786
yelling about a Rat King.

531
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:42,788
A man...

532
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,751
that lived underneath
the streets of New York City.

533
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,169
Wait. I'm sorry.

534
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,003
A what?

535
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,173
Yeah. No, let me explain. Um...

536
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:57,720
The night of my book release,
I never even made it to the party.

537
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,723
Moments after I left
that voicemail for Betty,

538
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:05,728
I fell down a sinkhole
that had opened up in the pavement.

539
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,815
Yeah, it's rare, but I guess it happens.

540
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,610
There must have been some impulse in me

541
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,280
to just vanish or walk away
from the shambles of my life.

542
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,200
Because I thought to myself,
"I could stay here."

543
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:24,872
So I pushed together a couple crates
and formed this kind of cot,

544
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,290
then I tried to sleep.

545
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,336
But that is when he showed up.

546
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,965
Who are you?

547
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,345
- Samm?
- I'm the king of the underworld.

548
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,724
And you are a trespasser here.

549
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,021
- No! No!
- What good are you?

550
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,898
I mean, what do you even do?

551
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,982
I'm a...

552
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,026
I'm a writer.

553
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,819
I tell stories.

554
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,700
I can tell you a story.
Let me tell you a story.

555
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,035
All right.

556
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,164
Go ahead.

557
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,294
Tell me a story.

558
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,797
Now, luckily, I had a copy
of my book, The Outcasts, on me.

559
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,049
So I read it aloud.

560
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,971
And the Rat King ate it up.

561
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,312
That's what I'm talking about.
You're a born storyteller.

562
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,064
And because of that,
I want you to stay down here with me,

563
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,109
- where you'll regale me with your tales.
- That sounds great.

564
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:39,322
I'll come back tomorrow when everything
will be prepared for your arrival.

565
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,405
There,

566
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:44,744
away from my responsibilities
and expectations,

567
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,456
deadlines and dead-end relationships,
I, uh...

568
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:52,960
I was very eager
to join the Rat King's domain.

569
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,799
But that night... she came to visit me.

570
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,883
Jughead.

571
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,677
Jughead, wake up.

572
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,807
Betty. What the hell?
What are you doing here?

573
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,892
I'm saving you.

574
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,645
You're in danger.
You need to get out of here.

575
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,105
- Danger? What do you mean?
- Listen to me.

576
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,191
The city floods the sewer
once every two weeks.

577
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,861
That's happening any minute, okay?
If you stay down here, you will drown.

578
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,781
Come with me.

579
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,869
Betty walked behind me...

580
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,414
urging me through those dark tunnels.

581
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,210
It was a lot like that Greek myth
of Orpheus and Eurydice.

582
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,296
The two young lovers try
to escape the underworld together.

583
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,965
Well, somehow,

584
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,594
I made it to the light
and to civilization.

585
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,224
Some back alley in the East Village.

586
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,934
I was dirty.

587
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,602
I was just out of my mind.

588
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,480
I was also infected,
which I didn't know at the time.

589
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,525
So the cops found me,
and they picked me up,

590
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,527
and they took me
to St. Vincent's Hospital.

591
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:07,243
Betty saved me in the darkness
like she had so many times before.

592
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,751
So how much of what you told us was true?

593
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,878
That's a good question.

594
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:22,216
Well, when Jess told me
what I told her at the hospital, I felt...

595
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,847
that I needed to return
to the physical site of that core trauma.

596
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,848
That darkness.

597
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,644
And it took me two days,
but I found the alley

598
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,648
and... the sinkhole
that was now paved over.

599
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,069
And next to it, there was a sewer grate,
which I pried open.

600
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,531
And I entered the abyss.

601
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,953
It was definitely familiar.

602
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,500
I'd absolutely been there.

603
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,131
Confirmed when I found a copy of my book.

604
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:08,637
Scribbled in the margins was the story
of the Rat King and his captive

605
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,890
that I had completely made up.

606
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,560
Going to the source of my trauma
made me understand the Rat King

607
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,479
was just a fiction I'd conjured

608
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,231
to distract myself
from what really happened down there.

609
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,529
The night of my book launch,
I was angry...

610
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,615
and drunk.

611
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,245
And I fell into a sinkhole
and I lost consciousness.

612
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:38,667
And when I came to, I couldn't scream
for help because I was covered in rats.

613
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:45,508
I was afraid that if I opened my mouth,
they would crawl into it.

614
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,551
Oh, that's so...

615
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,845
It's horrible.

616
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,348
The worst part was that...

617
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,809
The whole event just...

618
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,062
made me realize how alone I was.

619
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,021
You know?

620
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,735
That night was supposed
to be one of my greatest triumphs,

621
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,862
and I was in a dark hole.

622
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,074
Literally and existentially.

623
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:15,995
And no one...

624
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,125
Like, no one missed me?

625
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
At all?

626
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,339
And that's what I'm dealing with now.

627
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,884
Just the wreckage of my life.

628
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,015
Step one is,
I need to get my drinking under control.

629
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,352
- That's why I'm here.
- We're glad you are.

630
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,313
Thank you for your share.

631
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,901
All right. So who's next?

632
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,573
Well...

633
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,410
A truly masterful showing, Cheryl.

634
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,457
Hope you know I didn't just bring you here
for the paintings, Minerva.

635
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,587
Although, there is one more piece
I'd love to show you.

636
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,589
I painted us as...

637
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,261
Psyche? Revived by Cupid's kiss.

638
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,263
It's gorgeous.

639
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:16,931
Do you love it?

640
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:23,314
Cheryl, last time I was here,
your nana suggested sacrificing me

641
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,065
to an angry eldritch terror.

642
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,944
Are you saying you feel nothing, Min-Min?

643
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,991
Look, I do love the painting.

644
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:38,287
And despite our last encounter,
I still have feelings for you.

645
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,707
But I'm about to leave
on an art-buying trip to South Africa.

646
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,626
In the morning?

647
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,919
Yes, I'm afraid so.

648
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,839
Well, that still leaves us with tonight,
doesn't it?

649
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,174
Yes.
