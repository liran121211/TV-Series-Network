1
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,886
[Jughead] From the start,
this story has been about a town.

2
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,473
And the people who lived in that town.

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,352
And the darkness that lived
in some of those people.

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,104
Clifford Blossom.

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,314
The Black Hood.

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,941
The Gargoyle King.

7
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,401
The Stonies.

8
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,822
Add to their ranks my sister, Jellybean,

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,533
who had been the voyeur-slash-auteur

10
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:37,078
making the videotapes that had been
disturbing our town for months.

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,625
This isn't your fault, Jug.

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,294
[Jughead sighs]

13
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,587
Just feels like it.

14
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,548
I was the one that convinced her
to move out here,

15
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,218
away from everything she ever knew.
Then I ignored her.

16
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,430
You were in the fight of your life
at Stonewall Prep.

17
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,724
[dramatic music playing]

18
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,059
JB's tough.

19
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,187
She'll get through this.

20
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,443
Hey. How is she?

21
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,447
I don't know. I really don't know.

22
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,159
Don't know if you're gonna like this.
I've been looking into child therapists.

23
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,995
I found one that has excellent references.

24
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,332
Well, I hope they're in Ohio
because that's where I'm taking Jellybean.

25
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,460
-Back to Toledo.
-Maybe you're right.

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,047
-She might need her mother.
-And her father.

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,050
What does that mean?

28
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,302
Alice...

29
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,097
she's my little girl.

30
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:42,143
If this isn't a cry for help,
I don't know what is.

31
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,146
Can we at least have a conversation
about this?

32
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,148
Yeah. Yeah, we will.

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,485
But first things first.

34
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,697
Jellybean finally told me where her
accomplices are hiding out most nights.

35
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,199
[knocking on door]

36
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,079
Jug? Mr. Jones? What's going on?

37
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,957
-We need you to open up your gym.
-Right now?

38
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,668
After we make a couple stops.

39
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,545
[knock on door]

40
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:14,092
Gentlemen.
To what do I owe this late-night call?

41
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,679
You need to reinstate Tom Keller
as sheriff. Right now.

42
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,475
[dramatic music playing]

43
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,040
[Jughead] Asleep,
they almost looked innocent.

44
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,585
It's just messed up.

45
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,548
We survived the death of Jason,
the Black Hood and the Gargoyle King,

46
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,801
but I didn't even consider
how the fallout of all that

47
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,887
would affect the generation
coming up behind us,

48
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,804
[thunder rumbling]

49
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,014
including Jellybean.

50
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,852
Unless a meteorite strikes this town
in two days,

51
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,812
we'll have survived graduation.

52
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,813
But will they?

53
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,111
Are we just doomed to be haunted
by this town for the rest of our lives?

54
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,029
[thunder crashes]

55
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,575
[Archie] Dad. Dad.

56
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,118
What gives? Take the picture.

57
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,914
-The ceremony starts in ten minutes.
-What's taking so long?

58
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,625
I-- I just can't believe we're here.

59
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,961
Archie, you're graduating.

60
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,215
Didn't think I'd live to see this day.

61
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,426
-[thunder crashes]
-[dramatic music playing]

62
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,274
-It's not even graduation yet.
-No, but it is your last day.

63
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:57,737
-Well, we don't know that yet.
-I do. I have a really good feeling.

64
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,822
You've been applying yourself
so much lately.

65
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,617
-Yeah, we'll see. Love you, Mom.
-Love you.

66
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,925
As honorary chairperson and
de-facto queen of tonight's semi-formal,

67
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,677
this one's for you, Jay-Jay.

68
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,763
[tender music playing]

69
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,859
[Veronica] Presents? For moi?

70
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,077
It's been a while since
you've worn any pearls from me,

71
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,247
so maybe you'll wear them
for the last day of school.

72
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,969
Is it true what they say about your dad?

73
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:09,058
That he's the devil incarnate?
I stand by my father.

74
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,782
-[Alice crying]
-[Betty] Please stop crying.

75
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,203
I was already picturing
Thanksgiving break.

76
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,622
You were gonna come home
on the train from Yale

77
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,583
and everyone would be here.

78
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,335
[tender music playing]

79
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,920
FP, Jughead, Jellybean.

80
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,132
You, Charles, Polly and the twins.

81
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,677
Yeah, that would have been nice.

82
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:49,057
-[sighs] Now it's just gonna be me, alone.
-Hey.

83
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,144
Even if it's just you and me
having turkey meatloaf at Pop's,

84
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,980
I will be here for Thanksgiving, okay?

85
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,693
And Christmas. And whenever you need me.

86
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,404
I love you so much, Elizabeth.

87
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,533
I love you too, Mom.

88
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,994
[school bell rings]

89
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,503
Seventy-five years ago,
the first senior class of Riverdale High

90
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,047
buried a time capsule
just before they graduated.

91
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,927
Now, as our seniors prepare for their
own graduation, it's time to open it.

92
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,762
-Ladies.
-[students applaud]

93
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:37,480
A copy of The Riverdale Register
from June 12th, 1945.

94
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:42,151
A copy of The Blue and Gold,
also from that same year.

95
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,739
This one's for Jughead. A Pop's menu

96
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,368
from when hamburgers only cost 15 cents.

97
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,163
A baseball card
of Ambrose "The Rocket" Pipps,

98
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,957
Riverdale's hometown hero.

99
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,211
Ew. A Red Circle comic book.

100
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:07,009
And lastly, a photo of four seniors,

101
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,514
and it's written here that this was taken
days before the boys headed off to war.

102
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,644
These will be on display for
closer inspection during graduation week.

103
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,690
And, fellow seniors,
enjoy your last day of high school!

104
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,277
[pop music playing]

105
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,779
Guys, doesn't this feel so weird?

106
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,740
Like, this is the last time
we'll all be hanging out together.

107
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,660
-Except for reunions.
-Yeah, and homecoming, Kev.

108
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,289
-It won't be the same.
-What exactly are we waiting for again?

109
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,999
Hot off the presses, chums.

110
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,500
-[Sweet Pea] Whoa, yearbooks.
-Oh.

111
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,087
-But Honey banned those, didn't he?
-Yes, but Honey is gone.

112
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,589
[Cheryl] Brava.

113
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,924
Well done, ladies. This is amazing.

114
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,469
There's even an entire page
dedicated to the Serpents.

115
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,181
-And a shout-out to the Pretty Poisons.
-And the musicals.

116
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,640
Despite the fact that--

117
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:59,103
[Bell over PA] Archie Andrews and
Jughead Jones to the principal's office.

118
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:03,274
Archie Andrews and Jughead Jones
to the principal's office.

119
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,193
Dead teens walking.

120
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,029
[suspenseful music playing]

121
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,075
-Guess who's graduating.
-Holy crap. You're a legend.

122
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,036
-Whew.
-What about summer school?

123
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,039
No more pencils, no more books,
no more teachers' dirty looks.

124
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,333
-I'm happy for you, Jug.
-[Bell] Archie.

125
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,168
He's ready for you.

126
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,838
It's gonna be all right.

127
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,590
-All right?
-Yeah.

128
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,515
[Weatherbee sighs]

129
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,851
I get no pleasure in telling you this,
Mr. Andrews,

130
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,397
but despite your efforts, you will not be
graduating with your classmates.

131
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,443
So, it's summer school for me.

132
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,780
Unfortunately,
that's not going to be enough.

133
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,283
You'll have to repeat your senior year.

134
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,080
I understand this is a shock.

135
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,209
But no one is going to hold this year
against you.

136
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,212
Yeah, I appreciate you saying that, sir.

137
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,467
Uh...

138
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,971
-Can I still--?
-Walk with your classmates?

139
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,890
Of course you can.

140
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,853
In fact, though it's last-minute...

141
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,358
I was hoping you might record
the graduation song for us.

142
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,528
Yeah, I'd be happy to, sir.

143
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,866
What's the verdict?
Summer school? Yea, nay?

144
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,577
Summer school, as expected.

145
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,913
But Weatherbee's letting me walk
with you guys.

146
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,417
-I'll have my diploma by the end of June.
-That's a relief.

147
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,670
-You can enjoy the last day of school.
-Yeah. Definitely.

148
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,927
[clock ticking]

149
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,847
[dramatic music playing]

150
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,610
-[school bell rings]
-[all cheering]

151
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,617
[indistinct chatter]

152
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,074
-Working on your speech?
-[Betty] Mm-hm.

153
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:02,203
Well, don't keep me in suspense.
What's it about?

154
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,667
Considering I haven't written any of it,
I guess you'll just have to wait and see.

155
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,419
Well, I'm sure you'll crack it.
You always do.

156
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,219
[knocking on door]

157
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,599
Ronnie. What's, uh--? What's going on?

158
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,271
I was cleaning out my room,
and I came across some choice items

159
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,857
that you've left
over the past three years.

160
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,819
And I wanted to give it back to you.

161
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,362
Oh.

162
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,536
Also, despite everything
that's happened between us...

163
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,623
I wanted to be with you tonight.

164
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,627
If only for one last time.

165
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,048
-Is that crazy?
-No.

166
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:57,842
Not at all.

167
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,720
In fact, I can't think of anything
I want more in this moment.

168
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,684
[dramatic music playing]

169
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,032
[tender music playing]

170
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,619
At school yesterday...

171
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,333
I spied you looking at that picture

What must have been going
through their minds.

175
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,978
Most of their classmates were heading
to college or in their family businesses.

after graduation, I--

-I'd go to Toledo with you and Jellybean.
-No. Uh-uh.

You're the first Jones man

I admit, I've been struggling
with what I wanted to say today.

And even death.

210
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:50,074
It's not fair that so many
of our classmates aren't here

211
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,367
to walk with us today.

212
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,163
It's not right
that some of our parents aren't here

213

214
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,381

other than the one steeped in violence.

216
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,763
Our class is lucky enough to remember
a time before the era of tragedy.

217

the generation coming up behind us.

220
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:30,280
And the one I want us, our class,
to remember as we head into the future.

00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,850
It's kind of the same plan I had
going to the Naval Academy.

344
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,771
Hardly. In fact,
it's nothing like the Naval Academy.

senior year, which I was gonna have to do.

Well, if that's what you feel is
the right thing for you, Arch, then--

351

Sorry, but no.
I won't sit here and support this.

You don't have a plan.
And I get that. That's scary. But this?

355

This is just straight-up lunacy, Archie.
And I won't indulge it.

360

a horror show in this town,

of the maple factory and groves,

and rehabilitate our family legacy.

371

373
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:50,460
If this is about my nana,
you need to get that out of your mind.

She's starting to come around.

375
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,715
She asked me if we were gonna
be living in the same dorm room

376
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,343

But I don't want you to have to choose
between your family and me.

382
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,823
Perhaps if I'm successful,
you won't have to.

383

towards my future, I wondered,

517
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,636
would we keep the vow that we made?

518
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,848
To return to our booth at Pop's
one year later?

519
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,182
Only time would tell.

Uh... No, I'm good.
I think it's time I take off.

525
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,961
I'm sorry they didn't make it.
They're probably just busy.

526
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,297
