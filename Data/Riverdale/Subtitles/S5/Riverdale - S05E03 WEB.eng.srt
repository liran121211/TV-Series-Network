1
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,886
From the start,
this story has been about a town.

2
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,473
And the people who lived in that town.

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,352
And the darkness that lived
in some of those people.

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,104
Clifford Blossom.

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,314
The Black Hood.

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,941
The Gargoyle King.

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,401
The Stonies.

8
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,822
Add to their ranks my sister, Jellybean,

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,533
who had been the voyeur-slash-auteur

10
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:37,078
making the videotapes that had been
disturbing our town for months.

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,625
This isn't your fault, Jug.

12
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,587
Just feels like it.

13
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,548
I was the one that convinced her
to move out here,

14
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,218
away from everything she ever knew.
Then I ignored her.

15
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,430
You were in the fight of your life
at Stonewall Prep.

16
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,059
JB's tough.

17
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,187
She'll get through this.

18
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,443
Hey. How is she?

19
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,447
I don't know. I really don't know.

20
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,159
Don't know if you're gonna like this.
I've been looking into child therapists.

21
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,995
I found one that has excellent references.

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,332
Well, I hope they're in Ohio
because that's where I'm taking Jellybean.

23
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,460
- Back to Toledo.
- Maybe you're right.

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,047
- She might need her mother.
- And her father.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,050
What does that mean?

26
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,302
Alice...

27
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,098
she's my little girl.

28
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,143
If this isn't a cry for help,
I don't know what is.

29
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,146
Can we at least have a conversation
about this?

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,148
Yeah. Yeah, we will.

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,485
But first things first.

32
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,697
Jellybean finally told me where her
accomplices are hiding out most nights.

33
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,079
Jug? Mr. Jones? What's going on?

34
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,957
- We need you to open up your gym.
- Right now?

35
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,668
After we make a couple stops.

36
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:14,092
Gentlemen.
To what do I owe this late-night call?

37
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,679
You need to reinstate Tom Keller
as sheriff. Right now.

38
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,040
Asleep,
they almost looked innocent.

39
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,585
It's just messed up.

40
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,548
We survived the death of Jason,
the Black Hood and the Gargoyle King,

41
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,801
but I didn't even consider
how the fallout of all that

42
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,887
would affect the generation
coming up behind us,

43
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,014
including Jellybean.

44
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,852
Unless a meteorite strikes this town
in two days,

45
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,812
we'll have survived graduation.

46
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,896
But will they?

47
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,111
Are we just doomed to be haunted
by this town for the rest of our lives?

48
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,575
Dad. Dad.

49
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,118
What gives? Take the picture.

50
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,914
- The ceremony starts in ten minutes.
- What's taking so long?

51
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,625
I... I just can't believe we're here.

52
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,961
Archie, you're graduating.

53
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,215
Didn't think I'd live to see this day.

54
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,274
- It's not even graduation yet.
- No, but it is your last day.

55
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:57,737
- Well, we don't know that yet.
- I do. I have a really good feeling.

56
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,822
You've been applying yourself
so much lately.

57
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,617
- Yeah, we'll see. Love you, Mom.
- Love you.

58
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,925
As honorary chairperson and
de-facto queen of tonight's semi-formal,

59
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,677
this one's for you, Jay-Jay.

60
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,859
Presents? For moi?

61
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,110
It's been a while since
you've worn any pearls from me,

62
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,247
so maybe you'll wear them
for the last day of school.

63
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,969
Is it true what they say about your dad?

64
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:09,058
That he's the devil incarnate?
I stand by my father.

65
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,782
Please stop crying.

66
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,203
I was already picturing
Thanksgiving break.

67
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,622
You were gonna come home
on the train from Yale

68
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,583
and everyone would be here.

69
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,920
FP, Jughead, Jellybean.

70
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,132
You, Charles, Polly and the twins.

71
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,677
Yeah, that would have been nice.

72
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:49,057
- Now it's just gonna be me, alone.
- Hey.

73
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,144
Even if it's just you and me
having turkey meatloaf at Pop's,

74
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,980
I will be here for Thanksgiving, okay?

75
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,693
And Christmas. And whenever you need me.

76
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,404
I love you so much, Elizabeth.

77
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,533
I love you too, Mom.

78
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,503
Seventy-five years ago,
the first senior class of Riverdale High

79
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,047
buried a time capsule
just before they graduated.

80
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,927
Now, as our seniors prepare for their
own graduation, it's time to open it.

81
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,762
Ladies.

82
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:37,480
A copy of The Riverdale Register
from June 12th, 1945.

83
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:42,151
A copy of The Blue and Gold,
also from that same year.

84
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,739
This one's for Jughead. A Pop's menu

85
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,368
from when hamburgers only cost 15 cents.

86
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,163
A baseball card
of Ambrose "The Rocket" Pipps,

87
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,957
Riverdale's hometown hero.

88
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,211
Ew. A Red Circle comic book.

89
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:07,009
And lastly, a photo of four seniors,

90
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,514
and it's written here that this was taken
days before the boys headed off to war.

91
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,644
These will be on display for
closer inspection during graduation week.

92
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,690
And, fellow seniors,
enjoy your last day of high school!

93
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,779
Guys, doesn't this feel so weird?

94
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,740
Like, this is the last time
we'll all be hanging out together.

95
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,660
- Except for reunions.
- Yeah, and homecoming, Kev.

96
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,289
- It won't be the same.
- What exactly are we waiting for again?

97
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,999
Hot off the presses, chums.

98
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,500
Yearbooks.

99
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,087
- But Honey banned those, didn't he?
- Yes, but Honey is gone.

100
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,589
Brava.

101
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,924
Well done, ladies. This is amazing.

102
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,469
There's even an entire page
dedicated to the Serpents.

103
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,181
- And a shout-out to the Pretty Poisons.
- And the musicals.

104
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,640
Despite the fact that...

105
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:59,103
Archie Andrews and
Jughead Jones to the principal's office.

106
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:03,274
Archie Andrews and Jughead Jones
to the principal's office.

107
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,193
Dead teens walking.

108
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,075
- Guess who's graduating.
- Holy crap. You're a legend.

109
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,036
What about summer school?

110
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,039
No more pencils, no more books,
no more teachers' dirty looks.

111
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,333
- I'm happy for you, Jug.
- Archie.

112
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,168
He's ready for you.

113
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,838
It's gonna be all right.

114
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,590
- All right?
- Yeah.

115
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,851
I get no pleasure in telling you this,
Mr. Andrews,

116
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,397
but despite your efforts, you will not be
graduating with your classmates.

117
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,443
So, it's summer school for me.

118
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,780
Unfortunately,
that's not going to be enough.

119
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,283
You'll have to repeat your senior year.

120
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,080
I understand this is a shock.

121
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,209
But no one is going to hold this year
against you.

122
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,212
Yeah, I appreciate you saying that, sir.

123
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,971
- Can I still...?
- Walk with your classmates?

124
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,890
Of course you can.

125
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,853
In fact, though it's last-minute...

126
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,358
I was hoping you might record
the graduation song for us.

127
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,528
Yeah, I'd be happy to, sir.

128
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,866
What's the verdict?
Summer school? Yea, nay?

129
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,577
Summer school, as expected.

130
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,913
But Weatherbee's letting me walk
with you guys.

131
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,417
- I'll have my diploma by the end of June.
- That's a relief.

132
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,670
- You can enjoy the last day of school.
- Yeah. Definitely.

133
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,074
Working on your speech?

134
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:02,203
Well, don't keep me in suspense.
What's it about?

135
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,667
Considering I haven't written any of it,
I guess you'll just have to wait and see.

136
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,419
Well, I'm sure you'll crack it.
You always do.

137
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,599
Ronnie. What's, uh...? What's going on?

138
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,271
I was cleaning out my room,
and I came across some choice items

139
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,857
that you've left
over the past three years.

140
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,819
And I wanted to give it back to you.

141
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,536
Also, despite everything
that's happened between us...

142
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,623
I wanted to be with you tonight.

143
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,627
If only for one last time.

144
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,048
- Is that crazy?
- No.

145
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,007
Not at all.

146
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,721
In fact, I can't think of anything
I want more in this moment.

147
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,619
At school yesterday...

148
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:31,333
I spied you looking at that picture
from the time capsule.

149
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,296
What gives?

150
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,968
I was just wondering what...

151
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,305
What must have been going
through their minds.

152
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,978
Most of their classmates were heading
to college or in their family businesses.

153
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,774
These guys were going out to fight a war.

154
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,324
You're not getting any crazy ideas,
are you?

155
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,744
Not unless you consider
summer school crazy.

156
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,423
Hey, I was thinking, uh,
after graduation, I...

157
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:23,803
- I'd go to Toledo with you and Jellybean.
- No. Uh-uh.

158
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,097
Well, you said it yourself,
family is what's most important right now.

159
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,185
You're the first Jones man
to get into college. You're going.

160
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,230
And you're old enough to be on your own.
You understand?

161
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,816
Right, boy?

162
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,284
And this, Nana, has been my locker
since the end of sophomore year.

163
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,955
Hmm. It's a lot nicer than the one you had
at Southside High.

164
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,499
But all your things are still in it.

165
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,169
I know.
I'll clean it out over the weekend.

166
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,006
A lot of special memories
with a lot of special people.

167
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,553
Including my girlfriend.

168
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:12,101
We're so incredibly proud of you, Toni.
The whole family is.

169
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,311
You've honored the Topaz name.

170
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,012
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay, Mom.

171
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,806
I'm just missing Dad.

172
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,393
I wish he was here.

173
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,188
He's here, honey. He's here.

174
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,821
Ladies and gentlemen,
it imbues me with such pride and joy

175
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,700
to invite to the stage
the senior class's valedictorian,

176
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,869
Miss Elizabeth Cooper.

177
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Hi.

178
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,176
I admit, I've been struggling
with what I wanted to say today.

179
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:34,558
High school is supposed to be
this amazing, safe time.

180
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:42,274
But our years were co-opted
with heartache and drama.

181
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,444
And even death.

182
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:50,074
It's not fair that so many
of our classmates aren't here

183
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,367
to walk with us today.

184
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,163
It's not right
that some of our parents aren't here

185
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,248
to watch those of us who are.

186
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,381
Those younger than us
have known no Riverdale

187
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,591
other than the one steeped in violence.

188
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,763
Our class is lucky enough to remember
a time before the era of tragedy.

189
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,308
When this was just a small...

190
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:21,021
sleepy, slightly boring town.

191
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,859
That's the Riverdale I wish upon
the generation coming up behind us.

192
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:30,280
And the one I want us, our class,
to remember as we head into the future.

193
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,783
So, please...

194
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,120
stay young...

195
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,789
for as long as you can.

196
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,252
Stay innocent for as long as possible.

197
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,340
Even if it's only for one more moment.

198
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,760
Thank you.

199
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,308
- Cheryl. Cheryl.
- Mother?

200
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,603
What's going on?

201
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,564
Well, I wasn't about to miss
my only child's graduation,

202
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,566
so I snuck in the back at the last minute.

203
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,612
Also, I wanted to tell you
about a decision that I've made.

204
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:01,950
With you being a grown woman now, I'm
gonna turn myself over to the authorities.

205
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,204
To pay for...
Well, some of the crimes I've committed.

206
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,287
What?

207
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,959
- But, Mumzie, you're a hothouse flower.
- I've spoken to Hiram Lodge.

208
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,213
He's promised to take proper care of me
in his private jail.

209
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,298
And with good behavior,

210
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:20,010
I may even be out in time to see you
graduate from Highsmith College.

211
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,095
Oh, Mumzie. If that's even happening.

212
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,599
Nightmare child, what do you mean?

213
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,061
Gotta hit the road
if we wanna make it by sundown.

214
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,062
Dad.

215
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,029
Boy, I know you would've given up Iowa
for Jellybean,

216
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,531
and I promise you,
she's gonna know it too, but...

217
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:47,621
But you going to college,
being a success...

218
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,749
that's good for us Joneses.

219
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,297
I love you.

220
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,092
I love you too, Jug.

221
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,521
So is this it?

222
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,857
The end of our story?

223
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,111
God, I hope not.

224
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,282
But you know, for now, I...

225
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,365
I know.

226
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,454
I know what you have to do.
And I love you for it.

227
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,016
- It's not too late, is it?
- No, it's not too late.

228
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,352
We're happy to discuss options with you,

229
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,812
but this isn't a decision
to be taken lightly.

230
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,232
I understand.
I'd love to hear what you have to say.

231
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,285
Hey, Pop.

232
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,955
Can I grab a clean menu?
It's for something Betty has planned.

233
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,834
I've been doing this a long time.

234
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,004
It's never easy watching you kids
head off to college.

235
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,548
Which reminds me, Pop,

236
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,094
the paperwork's coming your way,
but the gist of it is...

237
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,640
I'm signing over full ownership
of Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe diner to you.

238
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,684
Veronica.

239
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,479
I don't know what to say,

240
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,440
except... thank you.

241
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,069
You know, it's funny.

242
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,363
When I first came to Riverdale...

243
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,992
I never imagined I would call it home.

244
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,535
Ever.

245
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,789
And then I came here,

246
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,748
to Pop's.

247
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,336
And that's exactly what it felt like.

248
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Home.

249
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,761
Did everyone bring an item?

250
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,975
I am putting in today's copy
of The Riverdale Register

251
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,643
and The Blue and Gold.

252
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,855
My last edition as editor-in-chief.

253
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,775
And a bobby pin, in case anyone needs it.

254
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,612
I'm putting in a football
signed by all of the Bulldogs.

255
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,197
Long may they roar.

256
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,826
I am putting in a Pop's menu
and a La Bonne Nuit matchbook.

257
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,370
I am putting in the programs
from my musicals,

258
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,832
as well as a pair of Josie's cat ears.

259
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,333
I wish she was here with us.

260
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:24,337
Oh, HBIC shirt,
I found no one deserving of you.

261
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,715
Therefore, toodles!

262
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,470
The Pretty Poisons were fun,
but, uh, I'm gonna keep my Serpent jacket.

263
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,847
'Cause I'll always be one at heart.

264
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,851
Well, it's getting pretty full
in there, but...

265
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,401
Finally.

266
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,405
I'm putting in a guitar pick
and a hammer from my dad's toolbox.

267
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,298
You guys are the best friends
anyone could ask for.

268
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,885
Uh-oh.
Sounds like another vow is coming on.

269
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,346
So let's make a vow. Really.

270
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,640
The four of us right now.

271
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,849
That in one year,

272
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,770
no matter what's going on in our lives,
we'll meet back at Pop's.

273
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,230
One year from today.

274
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,607
And every year after that. Deal?

275
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,566
Deal.

276
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,197
Good.

277
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,617
Okay.

278
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,454
There's... There's something else.

279
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,665
You're very dramatique
this evening, Archie.

280
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,002
I'm joining the Army.

281
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,549
I know it's sudden.

282
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,720
But I enlisted and I leave
for basic training in the morning.

283
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,850
It's kind of the same plan I had
going to the Naval Academy.

284
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,771
Hardly. In fact,
it's nothing like the Naval Academy.

285
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,651
I can get my degree without repeating
senior year, which I was gonna have to do.

286
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,278
I'd be set up for college.

287
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,070
Look, guys.

288
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,740
For the first time in a long time...

289
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,996
I don't feel scared or uncertain
about my future.

290
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:27,669
Well, if that's what you feel is
the right thing for you, Arch, then...

291
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,213
Sorry, but no.
I won't sit here and support this.

292
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,924
Wait. Ronnie, wait, wait. Ronnie.

293
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,636
- You know there's a war going on, right?
- Of course.

294
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:43,018
You don't have a plan.
And I get that. That's scary. But this?

295
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:48,148
This is just straight-up lunacy, Archie.
And I won't indulge it.

296
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,192
Ronnie.

297
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:56,865
Toni.

298
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,160
I have something to tell you,
and it's not going to be easy.

299
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,871
I'm not going to Highsmith College.

300
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:07,083
I'm confused.
Because it doesn't have cheerleading?

301
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,045
That and...

302
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,467
- it just doesn't feel right anymore.
- If you don't go, I'm not going.

303
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,677
No. You must.

304
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,846
You will thrive there.

305
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:24,309
But I have to fix things here.

306
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,978
What are you talking about? What things?

307
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:31,900
The Blossom family name conjures
a horror show in this town,

308
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,818
and rightfully so.

309
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,322
But now that I have control
of the maple factory and groves,

310
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:41,701
I have a chance to lift up this town
and rehabilitate our family legacy.

311
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,662
But I need to be here...

312
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,331
where the damage was done.

313
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:50,460
If this is about my nana,
you need to get that out of your mind.

314
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,837
She's starting to come around.

315
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,715
She asked me if we were gonna
be living in the same dorm room

316
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,343
so she could send us care packages.

317
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,970
That's progress, right?

318
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:02,888
Toni.

319
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,812
You know I love you
with every ounce of my soul.

320
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:15,819
But I don't want you to have to choose
between your family and me.

321
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,823
Perhaps if I'm successful,
you won't have to.

322
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,201
And we can be together
with their full blessing.

323
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,912
But...

324
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,082
in the meantime...

325
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,165
Don't say it.

326
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,795
I don't wanna hear you say it.

327
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,758
Then you never shall.

328
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,306
How's Veronica doing?

329
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,600
Confused,

330
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,018
angry, worried.

331
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,479
Yeah. That makes sense.

332
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,278
Don't you think it's crazy that she had
no idea what Archie was planning to do?

333
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:03,825
Maybe it's me, but it seems like the two
of them have been squirrely since prom.

334
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,663
Did you notice that? I just don't know
what the problem could be.

335
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,166
What could have got them derailed?

336
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,379
I think I may know what happened, Jug.

337
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,724
- I have to tell you something.
- Oh, no.

338
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,102
During Hedwig...

339
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,397
Archie and I kissed.

340
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,776
Once. Only once, I swear.

341
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:43,573
I'm guessing Archie told Veronica,
that's why they've been acting so weird.

342
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,495
I didn't tell you, Jug, and I'm so sorry.

343
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,208
I should have told you
when it happened. I'm sorry.

344
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,418
I'm so sorry.

345
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,879
I'm so sorry.

346
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,625
All right. I better get going
if I'm gonna get Archie to the bus stop.

347
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,921
Yeah, I should go see
and be with Veronica.

348
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,883
Hey, when I get back, can we...

349
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,343
talk about us?

350
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,223
Yeah. Of course.

351
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,643
I love you, Jug.

352
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,062
I love you too, Betty.

353
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,652
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, just about.

354
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,361
Hey, come here.

355
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,031
You be a good boy, okay?

356
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,199
Look after Mom.

357
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,993
I love you, buddy.

358
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,876
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you.

359
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,629
Thank you for everything.

360
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,986
Vee.

361
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,283
I have to apologize to you
about something.

362
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,993
I know, Bee.

363
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,705
And I'm not mad at you.

364
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,458
I can't be. Not today.

365
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,961
I'm too upset.

366
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,713
I'm sorry.

367
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,308
Listen, Jug.

368
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,732
Before I leave,
I have to tell you something.

369
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,068
Archie, I know.

370
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,404
About you and Betty? She told me.

371
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,282
It's okay.

372
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,248
- Seriously?
- Yeah, seriously.

373
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,213
I know neither of you did it
to hurt me or Veronica.

374
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:49,509
And maybe a little normal
high-school angst is good for us.

375
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,431
So, yeah. We're okay.

376
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,849
Seriously.

377
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,269
We always will be.

378
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:06,275
I feel so responsible for what's
happening between you and Archie.

379
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,278
It's not that, Betty. It's not.

380
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,574
It's how it's all ending.

381
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,454
So sudden and unresolved.

382
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,335
I wish I had said goodbye to him.

383
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:26,878
You know?

384
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,800
More than anything, I wish...

385
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,055
I wish I had hugged him one more time.

386
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,683
Let's do that. His bus may not have left.

387
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,893
I know how we're gonna get there.

388
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,401
- Guys.
- Jughead, where's Archie?

389
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:53,156
- The bus left a minute ago. He's gone.
- Well, not yet he's not. Get in.

390
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,581
No. Just I love you, Ronnie.

391
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,819
I love you, Archie!

392
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,321
I love you too, Ronnie.

393
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,120
Sir, can you pull the bus over? Please.

394
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,497
It's my girl and my friends.

395
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:34,173
You stay safe, Archie Andrews. I mean it.

396
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:35,882
I will.

397
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,428
I love you.

398
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,013
I love you.

399
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,399
Later, bro.

400
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,985
Don't "bro" me.

401
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,331
- See you in a year, Arch.
- See you in a year, Betty.

402
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,031
We'll rebuild here, Nana.

403
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,034
And not just our ancestral mansion,
Thornhill,

404
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:30,957
which I burned down in my youth,
but the Blossom name and legacy.

405
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,467
Once Archie had left,

406
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,263
it was as if the glue that held our group
together had begun to dissolve.

407
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,139
First to go was Veronica.

408
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,102
Guys, I'm gonna take a little time off
before school starts.

409
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,439
Spend the summer with my mom
and Andy Cohen in the Hamptons.

410
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,441
Your mom will love that.

411
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,487
She was gone within a week.

412
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,323
As for Betty and me, things had changed.

413
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,076
We never talked about her and Archie,

414
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,662
about the growing distance between us.

415
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,914
Not even when she announced...

416
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,125
I'm going to New Haven early.

417
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,048
My mom and I are taking a road trip
before she drops me off.

418
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,848
You guys deserve the R & R.

419
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,852
What's gonna happen to us?

420
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,689
I still love you.

421
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,525
I'll always love you.

422
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,489
I'll always love you too.

423
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,374
But for now, you should focus on Yale.

424
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,294
And I'll focus on Iowa.

425
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,352
After Betty left, it didn't feel right

426
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,062
to keep living at the Cooper's anymore.

427
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,443
So I moved into Archie's house,

428
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,738
which was empty for the time being,
waiting to be sold.

429
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,117
Then they cut the electricity.

430
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,418
Which was fine, but then the gas was
shut down and with it the hot water.

431
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:43,339
So I sought refuge in a place
I knew all too well.

432
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,302
Honey? I'm home!

433
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,598
I stayed there until August,

434
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:57,603
when it was finally time to go where
no Jones man had gone before, college.

435
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,982
But I couldn't leave town
without one last burger.

436
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,155
I'm gonna miss seeing you
in here every day.

437
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,741
I'm gonna miss you too, Pop.

438
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,008
As I paid the check and headed
towards my future, I wondered,

439
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,636
would we keep the vow that we made?

440
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,848
To return to our booth at Pop's
one year later?

441
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,182
Only time would tell.

442
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,870
Another refill, Jug?

443
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,416
Uh... No, I'm good.
I think it's time I take off.

444
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,961
I'm sorry they didn't make it.
They're probably just busy.

445
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,297
Yeah, probably.

446
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,236
It would be six years
before I saw my friends again.

447
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,823
We'd be different people, each of us.

448
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:38,078
Brought together by, of course,
a new crisis and mystery.

449
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,875
But that's another story

450
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,585
for another day.
