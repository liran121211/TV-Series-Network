1
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,052
There's an old adage:

2
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,680
"You can't go home again."

3
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,808
Which was certainly ringing true for us.

4
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,644
Archie had been in a war.

5
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,980
Betty was an FBI agent.

6
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,107
Veronica was married.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,276
Toni was Queen of the Serpents.

8
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,403
And I was a published writer.

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,408
So why were we only talking about
how the town of Riverdale had fallen?

10
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,703
And Archie's pipe dream
to somehow save it.

11
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:41,207
Probably because it was easier
than the conversations that awaited us.

12
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,127
Why didn't you reach out?

13
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:51,176
I didn't think you wanted me to,
after you left me that voicemail.

14
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,597
On the night of your book launch.

15
00:00:56,514 --> 00:01:00,268
After that, I just assumed
you didn't want to hear from me.

16
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,690
It wasn't my intention.
Sorry if it came off that way.

17
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,776
It is nice to see you.

18
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,780
Even if it's strange to be back here.

19
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,282
It's just deeply uncanny.

20
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,536
Same old Archie though,
trying to save everyone.

21
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,622
Good luck with that, dude.

22
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,000
I mean, I have a book to write.

23
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,629
After Pop's retirement party,
I have to get back to Quantico.

24
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,381
It's good to see you too, Jug.

25
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,093
Even though it is a bit weird.

26
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,976
That's some rock on your finger.

27
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,604
Must be a great guy.

28
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,897
Chad?

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,065
Yeah, he is.

30
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,818
Underneath the bluster and bravado.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,241
What about you, Bugle Boy?
I'm sure you've had a swarm of lovers.

32
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,409
I don't know about that.

33
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:04,958
The last real relationship
I was in was while I was with you.

34
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,381
A devil-may-care fling never hurt anybody.

35
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,426
You should be having fun
at this point in your life.

36
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,512
Once you're married...

37
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,766
Well, that's why this is just
a quick jaunt for me.

38
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,019
I have to get back to my life, my husband.

39
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,438
Yeah, for sure.

40
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,653
Mom?

41
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:37,574
I brought you a vanilla milkshake.

42
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,577
Oh, thanks, sweetheart.
Will you put it in the fridge?

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,912
Keep your voice down,
the twins are asleep.

44
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,873
Sure. Is Polly home yet?

45
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,499
Nope. Not yet.

46
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,168
It's late. Where is she?

47
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,172
Out and about. At work.
You know your sister.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,499
Jones, it's Samm.

49
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,044
Where the hell are you?
And where are your pages?

50
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,630
- Scribners is...
- Forsythe Jones,

51
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,716
you currently owe $9876
to Premiere Credit.

52
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,220
If you do not pay
the outstanding balance within 24 hours...

53
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,686
So how did the Bughead reunion go?

54
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,815
As well as it could have, considering.

55
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,194
Not all of us can be shacked up
with our high school sweethearts.

56
00:03:56,277 --> 00:04:00,657
- Uh, FBI agent. High-school drama teacher.
- I'm technically not an agent yet.

57
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,038
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

58
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,751
Charles. He kept files of everyone
in my family, including me.

59
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,172
And tapes
of our phone conversations, I think.

60
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,969
Edgar?

61
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,930
- Is it really you?
- No, bitch. It's your sister.

62
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,724
- What?
- You're as good as dead to me now.

63
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,768
What? Betty...?

64
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,353
- Is that...?
- Me.

65
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,856
Calling Polly on Halloween, years ago.

66
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,614
Let's get right to it. I want back in
on the family businesses.

67
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,449
Don't you live in New York?

68
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:48,037
As it so happens, Chadwick and I
are looking for a weekend home.

69
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,497
Possibly here in Riverdale.

70
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,499
I see.

71
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:55,837
Well, unfortunately for you,
Hermosa moved the rum business to Miami.

72
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,133
And I sold La Bonne Nuit
to Toni Topaz years ago.

73
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,635
- Without telling me?
- It must have slipped my mind.

74
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,222
Like how you forgot to tell me
that you were marrying Chad.

75
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,642
If you're truly interested
in a weekend home,

76
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,811
may I suggest a property in SoDale?

77
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,815
Oh, you mean Stepford
for bougie mobsters? No, thanks. I'm good.

78
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,780
You want me to give you a job?

79
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,951
I need cash. I was hoping you could
set me up with some short-term.

80
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,747
You're lucky
I'm even willing to serve you.

81
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,914
What? Why?

82
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,751
What the hell is he doing here?
No way, Toni.

83
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,755
Gathering some research
for your next book there, Jones?

84
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,052
Hang on. Are you guys actually upset
about my novel?

85
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,055
- You made the Serpents look like fools.
- You mean, the Vipers?

86
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,433
The Vipers were the good guys.
I didn't use your names.

87
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,770
You think people around here
couldn't figure out who...?

88
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,564
What was
that one character's name? Toothy?

89
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,107
Yeah, or Popeye?

90
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,568
You mocked our traditions and codes,

91
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,737
and now you're asking for our help?

92
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,197
Toni.

93
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,241
- Guys.
- Okay, I'll help.

94
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,661
I'll give you some advice.
Watch your back, Jones.

95
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,914
You've made a lot of enemies in this town.

96
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,798
Principal Weatherbee,
as I wrote in my e-mail,

97
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,759
I'm here to relaunch the RROTC program.

98
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,970
Archie, I meant to reply,
but it's been chaotic.

99
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,054
What's up?

100
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,184
Riverdale High might not be opening up
its doors next Monday.

101
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,894
Like everything else in this town,

102
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,106
- our budget's been cut, thanks to...
- Hiram Lodge.

103
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,527
- Is there anything I can do?
- Alice, you're on the PTA.

104
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,904
Any word on which way
the school board's leaning?

105
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,407
The board has some serious doubts.
We're a skeleton crew.

106
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,662
Kevin, you're teaching,
what, five classes?

107
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,124
Drama, debate, biology, gym, and...

108
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:57,875
And sex ed.

109
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,086
- Are we dead in the water?
- Not yet.

110
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,923
Some board members would like
to see the school stay open,

111
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,635
if we can prove that we have
the personnel and resources,

112
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,428
which is questionable.

113
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,098
The board will hear arguments
before the vote, right?

114
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,767
We should all be there. I'll speak.

115
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,935
In the meantime,

116
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,564
let's target the board members
who are still waffling and work on them.

117
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,233
If we lose this vote, we lose the school.

118
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,110
Another nail in Riverdale's coffin.

119
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,391
It's Tabitha, right? Tabitha Tate?

120
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,810
It is.

121
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,896
And you're Jughead Jones.

122
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,734
Yeah, I am. I noticed that you're looking
for a new waiter. I'm interested.

123
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,613
Thanks, but this isn't
the right job for you.

124
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,531
You don't even know me.

125
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,325
Also, you can't sit here all day.

126
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:18,206
You have to order food, not just coffee,
and then you have to pay for said food.

127
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,375
My grandfather did things his way
and I do them mine.

128
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,630
And the first rule of my diner
is no running tabs.

129
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,351
Toni Topaz.

130
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,147
- You lost, old man?
- It's okay, guys.

131
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,315
I got this.

132
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,276
You can save your breath.

133
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,114
If you're here to bribe me or threaten me
into giving up Riverdale High...

134
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,452
- How many students do you have?
- A hundred or so.

135
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,664
What if I offer them all
a scholarship to Stonewall?

136
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,792
They'd get a world-class education
at zero cost.

137
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,795
Except that you're on the board
at Stonewall Prep.

138
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,798
Which means
the school must reflect your morals,

139
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,675
which I'm not okay with.

140
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,637
What if I told you
that there was an open position

141
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,015
with a corner office
and a big, fat paycheck?

142
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,850
Thanks but no thanks.

143
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,437
- So we're playing hardball, huh?
- I guess so.

144
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,702
Kevin and I used to sneak peeks
through that window,

145
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,620
hoping you were shirtless.

146
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,831
And now you're spying on...?

147
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,960
Ghoulies. They've turned
my house into a drug den.

148
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,006
That tracks with everything
my mom says about this block.

149
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,508
I'm sorry, Arch.

150
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,885
It's only temporary.

151
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,055
Like Hiram Lodge trying
to close down Riverdale High.

152
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,724
I'm taking this town back.

153
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,769
- Building by building, if I have to.
- Well, I can help.

154
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,356
I mean, I trained with the FBI.

155
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,859
I may just take you up on that.

156
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,946
But first, I need
a little more information.

157
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,325
Where's the rest of your team?

158
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,911
You're looking at him.
Mayor Lodge cut my budget.

159
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,581
I've got no support staff and no deputies,

160
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,042
and I'm covering
a whole damn county by myself.

161
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,671
Unless, of course,
you count Hiram's private security force.

162
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,875
They're connected to SoDale?

163
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,133
They work out of SoDale.
They're corrupt as hell.

164
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,470
You should know
who's running the force. Reggie Mantle.

165
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,641
Maybe Reggie can help me
with my Ghoulie problem.

166
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,560
No. You call him, he'll tip them off.

167
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,104
He's getting a kickback from them.

168
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,775
- You won't get any help from Reggie.
- Not knowingly, anyway.

169
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:55,279
You may not have any deputies left,
but you still have their gear, right?

170
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,864
Kevlar vests, batons?

171
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,991
You might wanna dust them off.

172
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,786
I gotta do some recon first,
but after that...

173
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,623
we're going in.

174
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,837
I've been thinking about your offer,
Trudy. Is that job still on the table?

175
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,922
Hell, yes, it is.

176
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,133
The Morris William Agency would love
to have you as a sports agent.

177
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,094
But what about the whole L.A. of it all?

178
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,722
I've been wanting to give
the West Coast a try for a while.

179
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,809
Let me make some arrangements
and I'll get back to you, okay?

180
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:25,892
Okay.

181
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,814
- First class, of course.
- Yes, of course, Miss Lodge.

182
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,027
But I'm having a little trouble
with the credit card on file.

183
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,611
Really?

184
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,366
That doesn't make sense.
Let me get back to you.

185
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,785
It's so weird, Chad.

186
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:48,040
I was doing some online shopping
and our American Excess card was declined.

187
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,376
All of our credit cards were declined.

188
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,628
The same thing happened to me.
But don't worry.

189
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,797
I'll have it sorted
by the time you get back.

190
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,757
Which is when exactly?

191
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,804
The retirement party is in two days
so probably the day after that.

192
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,556
Well, hurry.

193
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,306
I miss you.

194
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,766
I will.

195
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,686
I miss you too. Bye.

196
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,523
Miss Veronica, excuse me for interrupting.

197
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,150
No problem. What is it?

198
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,069
I've noticed the same car
parked out front for two days.

199
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:21,198
A black sedan with tinted windows.
I fear you're being watched.

200
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,282
Followed.

201
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,618
I wouldn't be surprised.

202
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,539
Is it a "welcome back to Riverdale" gift
from my father

203
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:32,042
or a not-so-subtle message
from my over-possessive husband?

204
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,545
It's time to get creative.

205
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,299
And bring an old friend out of mothballs.

206
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,220
How high are you willing
to jump for these?

207
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,474
Let's say 20 grand for both.

208
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,558
I'll take 30.

209
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,019
But it has to be in cash.

210
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,479
Like, right now.

211
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:59,528
Also, you wouldn't by chance
happen to have any...

212
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,239
tasteful, discreet,

213
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,366
ladylike revolvers

214
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,619
tucked away somewhere, would you?

215
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:10,456
- This being Riverdale and all.
- I might have something.

216
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,883
Oh, my God. Polly.
You gave me a heart attack.

217
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,594
- You're the one pointing a gun at me.
- Sorry.

218
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,679
Old habits.

219
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,014
It's also 3 in the morning.

220
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,600
You can go back to bed. I'm not a burglar.

221
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,311
Hey, can I...

222
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,983
make you a cup of tea, at least?

223
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,742
Polly, I wanna apologize to you.

224
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,831
I wasn't there for you...

225
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,543
on the other side of The Farm
when you needed me most.

226
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,923
Also, for prank-calling you
that year on Halloween.

227
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,135
I really didn't mean what I said.

228
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,345
Wow.

229
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,682
- It's a deep cut.
- Yeah, I know.

230
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,643
I haven't forgotten.

231
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:02,902
If it's not too late, I'd like for us
to be real sisters to each other.

232
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,073
- How long you in town for?
- Just a couple days.

233
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,451
Once I finish at the academy,
I'll be home a lot.

234
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,871
I'm surprised
you're not already running the FBI.

235
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,497
I don't know about that.

236
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,419
I've missed you.

237
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,631
Ma, the twins...

238
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,176
We've all missed you.

239
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,986
- Good morning.
- Good morning, honey. How'd you sleep?

240
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:51,742
Well, I woke up when Polly got home.
Does she usually stay out that late?

241
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,828
She's working at that nightclub,
the Roving Eye.

242
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,705
She waitresses a few nights a week.

243
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,751
Is that a good thing?

244
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,046
She helps with the mortgage,
gets the twins everything they need.

245
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,631
She's doing her best.

246
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,548
We all are.

247
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,719
No, I know. I just remember
the Roving Eye can be sketchy.

248
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,888
Okay, that's not fair, Elizabeth.

249
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,016
You don't get to pop in
and judge your sister.

250
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,685
Or me, for that matter.

251
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,145
Ooh. Can you get that? Might be Toni.

252
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,357
You see the morning paper?

253
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,861
"Local school counselor runs seedy bar
and snake-dances."

254
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,988
It's a hit piece.

255
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,116
Hiram's trying to ruin my credibility
with the school board.

256
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,577
I'll run damage control.
I'll call each board member.

257
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,537
Good.

258
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,290
If Hiram is trying to drag
the Serpent Queen down to his level,

259
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,667
he's gonna get himself bit.

260
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,054
- Archie. What's up?
- Jug.

261
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,224
How's the Five Seasons?
Room service every meal?

262
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,643
Morning, noon and night.

263
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,354
I got an idea
for Pop Tate's retirement gift.

264
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,065
But I was wondering
if one of us should say something.

265
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,192
Give a speech about Pop Tate.

266
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:11,196
- Since you're the world-famous writer...
- Yeah. Yeah, I'd love that.

267
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,948
Okay, great. Thanks, Jug.

268
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,962
Reggie. Good to see you.
I appreciate you coming out.

269
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,050
Duty calls, Mantle answers.
You're having trouble with your tenants?

270
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:35,471
I'm having trouble with the gangbangers
using my house as a drug den.

271
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,099
Let's see if there's any merit
to your claims.

272
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:48,317
It's messy, but I'm not seeing
any evidence of drug paraphernalia.

273
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,070
Okay if we keep looking?

274
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,993
- Nothing here but stale cereal.
- Let's check upstairs.

275
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,793
Sorry, but I didn't see
any contraband anywhere.

276
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,460
Yeah.

277
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,340
It's almost like
somebody tipped off the Ghoulies.

278
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,347
There's nothing more for me to say or do.

279
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,267
- But thanks for your help.
- My pleasure.

280
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,036
Feels strange to think
of not working at this place.

281
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,331
You won't have to deal
with annoying customers like me.

282
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:48,127
Now, you know I had a lot worse
than you in here, Jughead.

283
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,545
It all worked out, didn't it?

284
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,465
I lived to see my retirement.
And you're a bigtime writer now.

285
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,300
- Always knew you'd make good.
- I'm sorry.

286
00:18:55,384 --> 00:19:00,097
Uh... Those are debt collectors.

287
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
Hi there. Counter or booth?

288
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,857
We're looking for someone.
Been known to hang around here.

289
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,650
Jughead Jones. Seen him?

290
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,493
No. I think I'd remember
a weird-ass name like that.

291
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,370
What do you want with him?

292
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,708
Give us a call if he comes in.
Okay, sweetie?

293
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,919
Oh. I'll be sure to do that, pumpkin.

294
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,545
Bye now.

295
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,183
Thank you.
It's not the greatest first impression.

296
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,895
How much you need?
I can loan you some. I've been saving up...

297
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,856
I'm not low enough
to take your retirement money.

298
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,942
I'll figure something out.
Thanks for the interview.

299
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,278
- See you tomorrow.
- Hey, Jones?

300
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,448
If you still want it,
the waiter job's available.

301
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,533
Okay.

302
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:08,081
In a couple days, could you just call them
and vouch for me and say I have a job?

303
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:13,086
I'll send them half of my weekly salary
so they don't break my legs?

304
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,632
Yeah. I think I can do that.

305
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,134
Long time no see, Ronnie.

306
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,677
Reginald.

307
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,348
You've been working for my father,
so let's skip the pleasantries.

308
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,433
- Fair enough.
- I need to buy a car.

309
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,519
Nothing flashy, just in good shape
and with excellent gas mileage.

310
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,939
- I'm paying cash.
- Who you running from?

311
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,067
Your husband? Is that how you roll now?

312
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,611
I'm not running from anyone, Reggie.

313
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:41,490
I'm taking the path of least resistance,
and I'd rather not leave a paper trail.

314
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,618
Now, will you sell me a car or not?

315
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:48,288
If you're in trouble, talk to your dad.
Really. Talk to him.

316
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,541
He'll help you, even now,
with whatever you need.

317
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,265
- You're sure you saw Polly?
- No doubt about it.

318
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,809
She's hanging with the Ghoulies,
probably using.

319
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,602
Seems like that's a safe bet.

320
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,562
I'm sorry, Betty.

321
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,730
I'm not sorry.

322
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,565
I'm pissed.

323
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,736
So my question is,
when do we kick their asses?

324
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,700
Thanks to Reggie Mantle,
I have intel to sweep and clear the site.

325
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:28,245
- How many Ghoulies are in your house?
- I counted a dozen.

326
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,914
We hit them hard. We hit them fast.

327
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,518
It's been too long since
the Serpents rumbled with the Ghoulies.

328
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:37,587
Calm down. I don't want anyone dying,
especially not my boyfriend.

329
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,716
Hopefully, they've dropped their guard
and we find narcotics.

330
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,093
And like Kev said, no one gets killed.

331
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:46,346
None of us and none of them.
Wouldn't mind breaking a few bones though.

332
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,430
Hell, yeah.

333
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,940
Ready? Three, two, one. Go.

334
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,927
You good?

335
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,387
- Yeah, you?
- Yeah.

336
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:39,483
Jingle-jangle. Just like the old days.
They've got a lab set up in the bathroom.

337
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,360
Will that be enough to put them
behind bars, Agent Cooper?

338
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,488
Yeah, Kev. That should do it.

339
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,828
- The Roving Eye.
- Hi, this is Polly.

340
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,122
I'm just calling to get my schedule.

341
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,457
Polly Cooper?

342
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,085
You haven't worked here for over a year.

343
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,169
Who is this?

344
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,590
Bad news.

345
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,801
Two more teachers
have defected to Stonewall Prep.

346
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,427
Miss Crouton and Mr. Cedars.

347
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,888
Damn, Miss Crouton! That backstabbing...

348
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,848
We've got a bigger problem.

349
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,769
One of my girls broke into Hiram's office
to see what dirt we could use against him,

350
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,146
and she found his agenda
for the town hall meeting.

351
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,524
It feels like we're in an episode
of Succession.

352
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,692
And besides
deciding about Riverdale High,

353
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,904
Hiram's also putting forth a vote
to unincorporate the town.

354
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,490
Based on the receipts,
he has enough people bribed

355
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,325
or terrorized into passing the motion.

356
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,327
Unincorporate? What does that mean?

357
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,205
It means that all the money
that the town gets from the state

358
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:39,251
for public services, for maintenance,
for education, it goes away.

359
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,711
It means that Riverdale,
as a town, ceases to exist.

360
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,715
Hiram will get what he's wanted
for years, the death of Riverdale.

361
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,509
So his SoDale can thrive.

362
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,513
If that happens, would we be able to keep
the school open with the board's support?

363
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,142
- Yes, but it will be much harder.
- We need to fight harder.

364
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,937
Alice, go on RIVW
and blow the whistle on Hiram's plan.

365
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,524
He was trying to keep it secret
so no one would oppose him.

366
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,527
We need the public there
so they can vote against his plan.

367
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,530
- What about our teacher problem?
- I can maybe help with that.

368
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,242
How? Do you know
any qualified teachers with degrees?

369
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,452
That's what it takes
to be a schoolteacher.

370
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,455
What if Riverdale went private?
We could choose who we wanted.

371
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,416
Yes, but we'd lose all public funding.

372
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,626
If the town unincorporates,
we lose funding anyway.

373
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,378
We need an investor.

374
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,256
I think I might know someone.

375
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,340
Archie,

376
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,886
if you have any favors to call in,
now's the time.

377
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,056
Reggie suggested I see you again.

378
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,768
I've been running around town,
trying to vamp my way out of a problem,

379
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,563
when, really,
I should be facing it head-on.

380
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,399
With, maybe, your help.

381
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,861
Go on.

382
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,908
Chad is threatened by my "alpha-ness."

383
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:57,537
Because of that, he can be somewhat
possessive and controlling.

384
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:02,417
He was having me followed,
but I shot out his goon's tires, so...

385
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,962
Ah. Young love. I remember those days.

386
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,255
I knew you'd relate.

387
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,843
Which is why I'd appreciate
you having a little chat with him.

388
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,803
As only you can, Daddykins.

389
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,847
Nothing too draconian.

390
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,433
Just tell him to stop trying to manage me.

391
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,770
- Or track me when I leave town.
- Why don't you tell him yourself?

392
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,647
He's not taking my hints.

393
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,483
But I'm betting the Hiram Lodge...

394
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,319
could be a lot more persuasive.

395
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:35,200
And then you don't get your little
Barnard-educated hands dirty, right?

396
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:42,123
Hmm. So, just to be clear,
you're officially asking me for my help?

397
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,627
Sure.

398
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,380
Yes, I am.

399
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,298
Well, in that case...

400
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
no.

401
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,012
Come again.

402
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:02,394
Remember you called me a dog?
That I needed to be taught a lesson?

403
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,313
It was about seven years ago.
You were cruel, Veronica.

404
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,897
Brutal.

405
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,567
When my body was a mass of bruises.

406
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,696
Well, now it's my turn
to teach you a lesson.

407
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,572
I warned you, from the start,

408
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:19,411
that no one outside of this family
would understand the Lodge ambition.

409
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,581
You made your bed.
You'll have to deal with Chad yourself.

410
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,876
If that means you have to crawl
into the mud to do it, then so be it.

411
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,462
You're a Lodge after all.

412
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:33,967
You never had any intention of helping me.
You just wanted to hear me beg.

413
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,387
Hmm. I assume you don't need
my help finding the exit.

414
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,025
But, Polly, it's not every day
that Pop Tate retires.

415
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,193
- We can bring the twins.
- I have to work.

416
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,196
- Can't you take the night off?
- Get off my back.

417
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,949
Polly. Give Mom a break.

418
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,951
It's fine. Polly has to work.

419
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,081
I'm not so sure she does, Mom.

420
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,044
I know you don't waitress
at the Roving Eye.

421
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,087
You've been hanging out with the Ghoulies.

422
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,132
- Elizabeth, stop it!
- How are you making all of this money?

423
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,010
To help out with the mortgage
and support the twins.

424
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,347
- Are you dealing? Tricking? Both?
- It's none of your business.

425
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,350
Actually, it is. Because I care about you.

426
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,644
You don't live here. You deserted us.

427
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,105
Being a sister doesn't mean
coming in for one day

428
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,776
and telling me how to live my life
when you don't know anything about it.

429
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,402
Wait, Polly...

430
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,507
- Samm. How are you?
- At the end of my rope.

431
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,093
Scribners wants pages or their money back.

432
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,637
Yeah, I know. I'm working on something.

433
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,305
What have you been working on?

434
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,975
Actually, uh, let me send it to you.
Let me know what you think.

435
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,645
It might convince Scribners
I'm not a one-hit wonder.

436
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:14,359
Okay, I'm e-mailing you right now.

437
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,328
I'm grateful for your help.

438
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,875
I'd rather be dealing with this mess
than the one I made at my own house.

439
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,502
Sorry to hear about that.

440
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,798
That's okay.

441
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,633
It'll be okay. I hope.

442
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,307
After Pop's party, I thought you, me,
Jughead, and Veronica could hang out.

443
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,144
Just the four of us.
We haven't done that yet.

444
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,480
No, yeah, that's a nice idea.
Let's do that.

445
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,151
Cool.

446
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,076
Hey, do you want some pizza?
It's the least I can do.

447
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,788
- Yeah. Pizza. Yeah, that sounds great.
- Okay.

448
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,878
- Gonna take a shower first.
- Oh, I should...

449
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,338
I... Me too.

450
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,132
- Wanna go first?
- Should I go home first?

451
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,092
Betty, what just happened?

452
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,137
I don't know.

453
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:10,558
Something we've been wanting to do
since high school but never got around to.

454
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,268
Yeah. Sounds about right.

455
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,105
- Just to be clear, we're...
- Friends.

456
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,067
Just good old friends.

457
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,362
We're both single adults. We're allowed
to have fun every now and then.

458
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,363
Yeah.

459
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,367
And it's okay
if we keep this to ourselves?

460
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,662
Yeah. Veronica's a married woman.

461
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:34,249
And Jughead and I haven't dated
for seven years, so...

462
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,502
I think it's okay.

463
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,962
Okay. Good.

464
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,176
What a gift.

465
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,386
Thank you, Archie.

466
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,096
It's from all of us, Pop.

467
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,473
A small token to show
how much you mean to us.

468
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,852
- To Riverdale High. To the whole town.
- Yeah.

469
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:59,190
You know, I had to drop out of school
to take over this place after my pop...

470
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,735
The original Pop passed away.

471
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,904
I never got to graduate.

472
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,575
This means the world to me.

473
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,537
Jug's gonna say a few words.

474
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,753
Sometimes it can be hard
to put our faith in this town.

475
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,634
But I think Pop created
something really special here.

476
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,597
A place for the lost and wayward souls
of Riverdale to come to.

477
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:36,185
And I think that's more
than a jukebox or vinyl booths.

478
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,147
It's like a lighthouse in a storm.

479
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:44,235
Now, Pop himself is many things.

480
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,155
He's a joker.

481
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,699
He's a soldier.

482
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,159
He's a cook.

483
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,079
He's a really good listener.

484
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,624
He's also a father.

485
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,375
He's a son.

486
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,627
And a grandfather.

487
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,087
And to many of us...

488
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,299
and to me personally...

489
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,389
he's about the only reason
that I made it through.

490
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,850
You gave us a home, Pop.

491
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,269
Thank you.

492
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:23,942
To Pop Tate.

493
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,112
- Who never let the lights go dark.
- To Pop Tate!

494
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,038
I'm glad you came.

495
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,541
I wasn't sure you would,
after I sent you my message.

496
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,001
It sounded rather dire.

497
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,255
Plus, Pop always added a drop
of human kindness to my order.

498
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,132
Have you considered my ask?

499
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,177
To fund Riverdale
and the new teachers it needs?

500
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,263
It's the only thing that might...

501
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,557
Might save the school.

502
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:01,270
Look, I came here to celebrate Pop,
not get caught up in small-town politics.

503
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,692
I can barely afford
Thornhill's renovations as it is.

504
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,111
I know you think you're cursed

505
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:12,281
and the sins of your family are so great,
you can't atone for them.

506
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,950
But you're wrong.

507
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,453
There's a war going on
in Riverdale for Riverdale.

508
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,414
We need you.

509
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,166
Sorry. I can't.

510
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,171
It will start as something good and end up
corrupted like everything I try to do.

511
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,467
If you won't do it for the town,

512
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,012
would you do it for me?

513
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,513
Please?

514
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,768
If our love ever meant anything to you,

515
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:42,979
help us.

516
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,528
If I gave you the money,
who would these new teachers even be?

517
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,035
You're really gonna do this?

518
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:01,372
You know, run the RROTC
out of your old high school, huh?

519
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,124
If I get a chance to, yeah.

520
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,628
It's why I wanted us to sneak in here,
the four of us.

521
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,715
Hiram's trying to shut this place down.

522
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,136
He's pushing to unincorporate the town,
which would wipe out Riverdale.

523
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,513
My father is nothing if not consistent.

524
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,349
We can stop him.
Or at least slow him down.

525
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,517
How?

526
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,772
We become teachers here.

527
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,234
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's a way to keep the school going.

528
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:34,405
Which means, if Hiram wins the vote,
we still have a defendable position.

529
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,615
This school.

530
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,283
And if we can save it,

531
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,828
we can give people
one more reason to stay in Riverdale.

532
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,123
In time,
we can bring this town back to life.

533
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:48,044
Archie, I'm married.
I have a life back in New York.

534
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,797
Yeah, and I have a novel to write.

535
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,674
Veronica,
plenty of people commute to the city.

536
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,301
Jug, you always said,

537
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,596
you do your best writing
in a booth at Pop's.

538
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,642
And it's not gonna be long.
A month or two.

539
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,229
Just to give Weatherbee enough time
to find permanent replacements.

540
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,814
I'm in.

541
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,608
Quantico can wait a couple months.

542
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,236
And I need to be here right now
for my mom and Polly.

543
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,319
Thanks, Betty.

544
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,114
Jug?

545
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,493
I'd have to clear it with my new job.

546
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,244
But why not?

547
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,124
I'd like to shape
some impressionable, young minds.

548
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,835
I'm in too. I'll make it work with Chad.

549
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:32,338
Considering that what's happening here
is all my dad's fault,

550
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,923
I need to give back more than anyone.

551
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,260
I didn't really wanna be
a sports agent anyway.

552
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,343
That's awesome.

553
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,722
So Bulldogs forever?

554
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,647
Bulldogs forever!

555
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,777
Before the school board votes
on the fate of Riverdale High,

556
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,030
Toni Topaz has asked to say a few words.

557
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,114
Good afternoon.

558
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:03,411
My name is Toni Topaz, and I am
a guidance counselor at Riverdale High.

559
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,708
"The point of a school board is
to make sure there is equity.

560
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,461
That kids of all ages,
from all different backgrounds,

561
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,881
have equal access to education.

562
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:20,386
Well, with the help
of one very generous donor,

563
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,349
I'm happy to announce that Riverdale High
will be able to do that

564
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,934
as a private school.

565
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:31,147
And, unlike other private schools,

566
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,274
Riverdale will be tuition-free.

567
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,402
And we're bolstering our teaching staff

568
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,780
with notable alums,
like Sergeant Archie Andrews,

569
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:44,785
FBI trainee
and Yale graduate Betty Cooper,

570
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,915
businesswoman
and Barnard grad Veronica Gekko,

571
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:54,086
and acclaimed author Forsythe Jones III.

572
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,255
So spread the news far and wide

573
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,926
that Riverdale and its children
will not be at the mercy

574
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,221
of Hiram Lodge's destructive whims."

575
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:04,804
Thank you.

576
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,725
That's very nice.

577
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,940
That was better than Kendall Roy's speech
at the end of Season 2.

578
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:18,819
And now I'd like to introduce what I hope
will be my last motion as mayor,

579
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,114
a proposition to unincorporate
the town of Riverdale.

580
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,202
All those opposed?

581
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,829
All those in favor?

582
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,168
Majority wins.

583
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,171
The township of Riverdale
is hereby dissolved.

584
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,642
What had taken decades to build
was toppled in the blink of an eye.

585
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,062
With the rap of a gavel,
Riverdale was no more.

586
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,606
And yet, life continues.

587
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,030
Samm, I was gonna call you.

588
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,950
Scribners loved
your story about the old man.

589
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,079
- They what?
- Yeah. They think it's your next book.

590
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:13,249
There's a huge market right now
for tragic Americana.

591
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,917
Dying community,

592
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,253
all of the miserable people
who live there.

593
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:20,047
We'll call it Elegy for a Small Town.
What do you think?

594
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,137
- I don't wanna write about that.
- You don't have a choice.

595
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,682
This is your ticket out
of the literary grave you dug.

596
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:33,144
- Now you need to deliver. Understood?
- Yeah, understood.

597
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,227
Thank you.

598
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,705
Hey, Mom. I checked upstairs.

599
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:56,083
The twins are playing,
but Polly's still not home. I'm worried.

600
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,419
You know your sister.
She gets angry, storms off.

601
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,005
God knows when she'll be back.
This is what happens.

602
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,341
But this one's on you.

603
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,846
I'm not coming home yet.

604
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,682
I'm gonna stay in Riverdale
a little bit longer, Chad.

605
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,143
Why's that?

606
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:18,939
My alma mater, Riverdale High, has fallen
on hard times and needs my help.

607
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,067
I'll be teaching there.

608
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,402
- That's absurd.
- No, no.

609
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,781
What's absurd is you freezing
our credit cards.

610
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:30,659
Especially since I made
most of the money in our joint accounts.

611
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,743
Yeah.

612
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:36,540
So, if they're not unfrozen
in the next, say, 30 minutes,

613
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:41,337
I'll consider it an act of aggression.
Like you having me followed.

614
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,549
And the next time you see me,
it'll be on Wall Street, on the floor,

615
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,343
when the markets open Monday morning.

616
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,762
This She-Wolf will tear out your throat

617
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,807
in front of all the other alpha dogs
with zero hesitation.

618
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,643
Is that it, then? Are we done?

619
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,270
You have 30 minutes
to reactivate our cards.

620
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:36,475
Jug.

621
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,602
Hey. Yeah. Sorry, it's late.

622
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,148
Wondering if you could use a roommate,

623
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,483
now that you're in this big house
all by yourself.

624
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:49,738
- What happened to the Five Seasons?
- It's a little rich for my blood.

625
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,322
Come in.

626
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,920
- It's Polly. Leave a message.
- Polly, it's me again.

627
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,049
I'm sorry about what I said before.

628
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:14,722
I really had no right to judge you,
especially after being gone for so long.

629
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,390
It wasn't my place, so...

630
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,436
I wanna tell you that I love you
and that I'm here for you,

631
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,190
so just call me and I'll come find you,
wherever you are.

632
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,358
Or I'll see you when you get home.

633
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,819
Just, please, please, please, come home.
