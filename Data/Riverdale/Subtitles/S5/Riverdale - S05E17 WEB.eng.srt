1
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:18,226
Ten nights working the Lonely Highway
and not even a nibble.

2
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,896
Truckers are not stopping for us.

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,816
We'd have better luck
at catching our killers

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,569
if we were flying solo.

5
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:31,740
Ten quiet nights with no new murders
is a win in my book.

6
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:36,327
When serial killers go quiet,
that is when you should be afraid.

7
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:41,916
That is when their desire to hunt
and kill is building up inside of them.

8
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,507
Dr. Curdle Jr., it's early for you.

9
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,177
I'm calling about our tongueless friend.

10
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,515
You asked me
not to report him to the authorities,

11
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:02,062
but I'm getting nervous
keeping his corpse in cold storage.

12
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,607
I'd like your permission
to incinerate the body in my crematorium.

13
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,526
No. He's evidence
for the Lonely Highway case.

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,448
It's risky for me, Miss Cooper,
and refrigeration's expensive.

15
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,493
Why don't I come by in a bit
with a payment

16
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,037
to help cover your extra expenses?

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,331
That would greatly ease my anxiety.

18
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,501
Okay. I will see you in a couple hours.

19
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:29,339
I thought leaving Chicago for Riverdale
would mean no nightlife. Ha.

20
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,675
- See you at dusk?
- See you at dusk.

21
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,261
I had just about
given up hope, Archie.

22
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:39,307
We haven't found the mother lode
of palladium yet, but I have faith.

23
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,770
Cheryl, me and the guys,
we're down there breaking rocks for you,

24
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,523
pulling 12-hour shifts,
when there's so much

25
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,567
- we could be doing topside.
- Yes, your crusade to save Riverdale,

26
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:53,321
which consists of what at this point?
Filling in potholes?

27
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:57,075
Maintaining the town's infrastructure
until we can get reincorporated.

28
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,577
Which I'm happy to do on my days off,
but it costs money.

29
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,829
I know where this is going.

30
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,997
If I'm putting my crew's focus
on the mines,

31
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,750
then I need your assurance
that if we find that palladium...

32
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,086
You and your men
will be fairly compensated.

33
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,382
In fact, I will deposit
a modest finder's fee via Chime,

34
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,343
in exchange for the nugget.

35
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,763
In the future, a portion
of whatever you unearth will be set aside

36
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,976
- to subsidize your revitalization efforts.
- We'll work our asses off for you.

37
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,604
Let's move on to the house in Sag Harbor.

38
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,524
That's mine. I won't sign
the divorce papers unless I get it.

39
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,320
I bought that house, Chad,
with money I made on Wall Street.

40
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,697
I want alimony too.

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,031
Fine, you worm.

42
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,366
And this apartment.

43
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,995
Fine. Fine.

44
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,999
Take The Pembrooke. You know what?
Take this ring and rot in hell.

45
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,501
I don't care, Chad. Take it all.

46
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,379
All I want, all I need is Archie.

47
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:58,428
Poor, dim, impressionable Kevin.

48
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,764
I'm worried for you.

49
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,978
When I started this ministry, it was
with nothing but the purest of intentions.

50
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:11,190
And now Cheryl has twisted it
into something profane.

51
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,235
Dare I say, cultlike.

52
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,238
When Cheryl made those bees dance
to her infernal tune,

53
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:21,034
I got distinct Wicker Man-like vibes.

54
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,828
If this religion is a cult,
you're in it too.

55
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,415
Hmph. Please. My will is a steel rod.

56
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,667
Can you say the same?

57
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,052
Pop's. This is Tabitha.

58
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,932
Oh, Mrs. Fields, of course.
How's Squeaky doing?

59
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,436
Riverdale is done with me.
And I'm done with Riverdale.

60
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,564
No, no, I haven't heard from her
since she left.

61
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:59,447
I admit, when Mr. Weatherbee told me
that two students had gotten into a fight,

62
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,408
you're the last person
I thought would've been involved, Britta.

63
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,287
I punched Tim Higgins once.

64
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,041
And only because
he wouldn't stop calling me...

65
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,378
homophobic names.

66
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,258
That's completely unacceptable.
I'll talk to Tim.

67
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,594
- But violence isn't the answer.
- I know.

68
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,722
The thing is, Miss Topaz, I think I am...

69
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,391
gay.

70
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:32,438
- I mean, I haven't told my family yet.
- Coming out can be a process.

71
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:37,735
And sometimes a difficult one.
It was for me when I came out.

72
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,071
But the good news is,

73
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,700
only you get to decide
when it's the right time.

74
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,287
I'll be here
if you need anybody to talk to.

75
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,497
If I wanted to talk to my parents...

76
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,917
- would you be there with me?
- Absolutely.

77
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,044
I'd be honored.

78
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,299
So my daughter continues
to be as much a thorn in your side

79
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,343
- as she is mine, huh?
- I keep hoping we might reconcile.

80
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,972
You won't.
Not as long as Archie's in the picture.

81
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,392
It's one of the things
I've learned over the years.

82
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,979
My daughter's greatest vulnerability
is her love for Archie.

83
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:18,026
So if you want a shot in hell
at saving your marriage...

84
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,157
you're gonna have to get rid of him.

85
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,867
It's a ghost gun.

86
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,413
No serial numbers. Untraceable.

87
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,585
Hey.

88
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,339
I just finished practice with the Vixens.
Wanna ride to Thornhill together?

89
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,009
Cheryl, can I ask you something?

90
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,053
When we pray,

91
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,097
who are we praying to? Jason?

92
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:53,728
Jason is more of a conduit,
a messenger to the higher power.

93
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,146
Which is what exactly?

94
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:57,939
I'm not sure.

95
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,026
- Let me fast on it.
- What?

96
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,694
It's like doing a cleanse.

97
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,865
No solid food, only hot water with lemon,
maple syrup, and a hint of cayenne pepper.

98
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,202
It flushes you out completely,
and then once I'm empty,

99
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:14,248
I can be refilled with wisdom
and answers for you, Kev-Kev.

100
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:23,716
I'm worried about a friend of mine.
A waitress who used to work here, Squeaky.

101
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,511
Her mom said that she never made it

102
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,680
- to her friends in California.
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.

103
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,808
Me too. Anything I can do to help?

104
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,185
There is, Jughead.

105
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,605
The Lonely Highway killings
are a mystery, right?

106
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,692
Everyone tells me there wasn't a mystery
you two couldn't solve back in the day.

107
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,946
So... I'm canceling all of your shifts.

108
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,616
You'll still get your weekly paycheck,
but it won't be to bus tables.

109
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,370
It will be to help Betty.
Betty, are you down with this plan?

110
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,871
Yeah. Yes.

111
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,207
- Jughead?
- Sure.

112
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,918
Great. What's the first step?

113
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,421
- I'm assuming you have case files.
- Yeah.

114
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,382
I'll start by reading those.

115
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,644
Chad?

116
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,263
So you captured a guy
who more or less confessed,

117
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,474
then they swallowed their own tongue

118
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,393
because they thought
you were going to dismember them?

119
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,855
That's the last big thing that happened.

120
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,274
You still think
this is several serial killers

121
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,610
- working in tandem over the years?
- Yeah. Yes.

122
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,778
A family of truckers

123
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,866
who have been kidnapping
and murdering hitchhikers and sex workers.

124
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,826
And Lerman Marshall Logan.

125
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:19,957
My ex-student that disappeared
and was somewhere for a week, remember?

126
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,626
Yeah, I've been thinking about him.

127
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:26,297
He doesn't fit any of the victim profiles,
which might be a clue in of itself?

128
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,634
He might be one of the only people
who encountered this family of yours

129
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,885
and survived.

130
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,639
At the time, Weatherbee didn't let me
talk to him because I was a teacher.

131
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,922
But now Lerman is transferred
and I've been fired, so...

132
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,374
- We need to talk to Lerman.
- Yeah. I'll find him on social.

133
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,609
Hi, Dr. Curdle. Um, I'm so sorry,
I have your money in small bills...

134
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,029
Another body's been brought in
from Swedlow Swamp.

135
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,865
I think you'll find it very interesting.

136
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,118
The victim is unlike any we've found.

137
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,496
The body has been completely dismembered.

138
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,583
- Why change their MO?
- Maybe to make the bodies harder to find?

139
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,336
- Have you identified the victim yet?
- Unfortunately not.

140
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,006
The body was mutilated
beyond all recognition.

141
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,926
But, based on the level of decomposition,

142
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,262
it could be your sister.

143
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,100
I'll need to perform
a DNA test on the remains,

144
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,811
- and then compare it to...
- Mine. Yeah, do it.

145
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,815
There's also a waitress from Pop's,

146
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,025
Lynette "Squeaky" Fields.

147
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,902
Vanished around the same time as Polly.

148
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,573
I'll reach out to her family
and ask for a sample as well.

149
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,827
It's so funny, Chad.

150
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,371
Your pathetic attempt to kill my lover

151
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,457
has made me rethink
what I want out of this divorce.

152
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,422
I'm getting everything.
And you're getting nothing.

153
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,508
And if you don't agree,

154
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,303
I'll press murder charges against you.

155
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,014
- How?
- You dropped the gun, idiot.

156
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,022
Check and mate, you little bitch.

157
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,360
Mmm, these croissants
are positively divine.

158
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:16,574
- You should try one.
- I already told you, Mother. I'm fasting.

159
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,326
For enlightenment.

160
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,077
As a matter of fact,

161
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,455
- I'm feeling rather...
- Light-headed?

162
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,581
Inspired.

163
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,502
I'm going to go paint
and let the invisible hand guide my brush.

164
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,088
- Oh, my God, Cheryl.
- I'm fine.

165
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,133
Just leave me be, you doubting Thomases.

166
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,514
I had Archie in my sights,
but the gun misfired.

167
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,394
Veronica stole my palladium.

168
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,523
Archie stole your wife.

169
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,027
I thought one bullet would right
these two wrongs, but...

170
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,574
As a wise man once said,
"Never send in a boy to do a man's job."

171
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,202
Get out of my sight, Chad.

172
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,414
You disgust me.
Better yet, get out of Riverdale

173
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,208
'cause you lost my daughter forever.

174
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Hi, handsome.

175
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,346
Hey. Ronnie.

176
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,849
- What's going on?
- Guess what's in here.

177
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,477
My divorce papers.

178
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
It's official.

179
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,980
I'm a free woman.

180
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,980
- You're going out?
- Yeah, I'm heading down to the station.

181
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,190
I don't mind the distraction
since Tom called

182
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:17,319
- and said there's another body found?
- Yeah. I went to the morgue.

183
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,532
I don't know if it's Polly.

184
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,201
The body, uh, is...

185
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,162
What, Betty?

186
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,539
It's dismembered.

187
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,208
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

188
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,670
I know. But Jughead and I have a lead.

189
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,588
Okay.

190
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,341
Keep me posted.

191
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,432
Look at what came out of me.

192
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,766
This.

193
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,852
This is your answer, Kevin.

194
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,314
The higher power we've been praying to,
drawing strength from.

195
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,773
I don't understand.

196
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,903
Earth, water, fire, and wind.
The fabric of the natural world.

197
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:04,658
- I'm still not following.
- The higher power is nature itself.

198
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,454
That's what
we should be worshipping, Kevin.

199
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,749
The elements. It all makes perfect sense.

200
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,505
- How do you figure that?
- For more than a century,

201
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,090
we, Blossoms,
have made our livelihood from maple trees.

202
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,761
But our roots go so much deeper
than I've ever considered.

203
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,930
Okay. So when we pray, we...

204
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,642
- pray to...
- Gaia. Mother Earth.

205
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,437
Okay. Got it.

206
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,816
You know, Cheryl...

207
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,487
I'm happy you found some clarity.

208
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,532
But I think I'm out.

209
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,286
This religion's gotten
a little too fringy, even for me.

210
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,747
I hope that's okay.

211
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,251
Of course it's okay, Kev.

212
00:13:56,126 --> 00:14:00,130
You've always been free to go.
But you will always have a place here.

213
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,642
- What if Lerman doesn't show up?
- He will.

214
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,311
I promised him my first edition copy
of War of the Worlds,

215
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,898
- which is actually a fifth edition.
- Hey, guys.

216
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,317
Whoever is terrorizing our town,

217
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,737
committing these inhumane murders,

218
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,115
you have to stop.

219
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,912
Every time the phone rings,
I pray it's about my daughter.

220
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,541
I pray for closure.

221
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,251
Just today,

222
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,086
another victim was found.

223
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,256
Their dismembered body is
at the Riverdale morgue.

224
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,385
What does it say about me
that I want it to be my daughter?

225
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,431
So that this nightmare will end.

226
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,976
So that I can wake up.

227
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,103
Please.

228
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,314
- Help me wake up.
- Mr. Jones?

229
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,858
Sorry, my bus was late.

230
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,819
Rough day, huh?

231
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,113
I'm worried about one of my students.

232
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,655
Britta Beach.

233
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,575
She's gay,

234
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,912
and she asked me to be there with her
when she came out to her parents.

235
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,831
So I was and...

236
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,832
Let me guess.

237
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,586
They didn't immediately say,
"We love you, no matter what."

238
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:25,549
Nope. They said, "Are you sure?
Do you have to be?"

239
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,260
I'm sorry, Toni. That sucks.

240
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,344
Bigtime.

241
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,555
It's such a lottery, you know?

242
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,975
Who your parents are,
what kind of family you grow up in.

243
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,187
It wasn't easy when I came out to my nana.

244
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,690
My dad was harsh when I told him I was bi.

245
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:46,111
He was like, "Great, you can choose.
So choose being with a woman."

246
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,699
"It's like...
It's not how that works, Dad."

247
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,408
Yeah.

248
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,037
Is Britta gonna be okay?

249
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,333
I talked her parents off the ledge,
I think.

250
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,336
But she's a tough kid.

251
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,546
So I hope so.

252
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,006
And for the record,

253
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,968
no matter what Baby Anthony is,

254
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,178
I'll be ecstatic.

255
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,346
Same.

256
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,235
What the heck was that?

257
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,328
- We need to get out of here.
- Eric's working down the tunnel.

258
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,539
- Get everyone topside. I'll find Eric.
- Archie!

259
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,040
Guys, get out! Come on!

260
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,876
- Everybody out! Let's go! Move!
- Let's get out of here!

261
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,254
Everybody, move, move!

262
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,693
What is it, you philistine?
I'm working on my 12 commandments.

263
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,406
Oh, my God, Kev.
How many are still underground?

264
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,866
Hello?

265
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,702
Cheryl, what's up?

266
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,080
Oh, my God. I'm on my way.

267
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,376
- Thanks for coming to meet us.
- Not a problem, Mr. Jones.

268
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,630
- I felt bad ghosting you like I did.
- That's okay. You're here now.

269
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,717
Are you still willing to talk
about that week you went missing?

270
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,510
Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready to.

271
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,430
Any details whatsoever could help
prevent this

272
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,182
from happening to anyone else.

273
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,475
Most of it's fuzzy.

274
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,311
The best I can piece together is,
I was sleepwalking,

275
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,272
like I sometimes do,
along the Lonely Highway.

276
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,943
Then, the next time I woke up,
I was in this metal shed.

277
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,823
It was small. No windows.
It looked like the inside of a spaceship.

278
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,284
That's how Polly described
where she was to my mom.

279
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,872
- What else do you remember?
- I could hear voices outside.

280
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,582
Voices. Plural?

281
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:07,211
- Yeah, maybe even a family?
- Were you alone in the shed?

282
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:11,882
Yeah. Till the Mothman came in
and helped me escape.

283
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,177
- The Mothman?
- That's what he called himself.

284
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,931
He had red eyes,
one bigger than the other,

285
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,183
or weird red markings on his face.

286
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,686
He said I was a mistake,
that I shouldn't have been caught

287
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,398
and that he was throwing me back the way
you throw a small fish back into a lake.

288
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,402
Wait, so he let you go,
he freed you from the shed,

289
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,863
then he took you to the Lonely Highway?

290
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,741
He said I better not tell anyone
what had happened

291
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:42,579
- or more Mothmen would come back for me.
- Oh, Lerman, this is very important.

292
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,581
Do you know where the shed is?

293
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,709
No. But it was close
to the Lonely Highway.

294
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,753
- I know that much.
- How do you know that?

295
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,755
I could hear trucks rumbling by.

296
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,094
Dr. Curdle has the DNA results.
He wants to tell us in person.

297
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,889
- Kevin, Cheryl, what's the update?
- Been trying Archie's phone and Eric's.

298
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,785
- They're not getting any signal.
- How long will it take to dig them out?

299
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,770
We need more hands.
We need heavy-duty equipment.

300
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,981
And it'll take hours, if not days.

301
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:13,068
Okay. Whatever you need,
no matter the cost, just do it.

302
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,654
You said there was an explosion.
What kind?

303
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,656
The kind that was triggered deliberately.

304
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,742
Who in their right mind would blow up
a mine on purpose?

305
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,370
I can guess.

306
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,042
Jackson.

307
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,384
You with me, buddy?

308
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,220
I'm here, sarge.

309
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,305
Okay, hold on.

310
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,188
Take shallow breaths.
Okay? We need to conserve oxygen.

311
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,271
The others...

312
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,192
- did they make it out?
- Yeah.

313
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,614
Yeah, it's just us. But don't worry,
I'm gonna dig us out, okay?

314
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,541
We ran your DNA
against the most recent victim

315
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,501
and it wasn't a match.

316
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,171
So it's not Polly again.

317
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:18,967
No. But the body parts were
a match to Lynette Fields.

318
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,761
Oh, my God. Squeaky.

319
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:26,350
There's more, I'm afraid. Your DNA did
come back as a match to another body.

320
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,936
Your tongueless John Doe.

321
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,231
The trucker? How can that be?

322
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,192
It seems he's your very distant cousin.

323
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,070
What? No, that's impossible.

324
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,907
All of the Coopers are either dead
or accounted for.

325
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,868
What about more distant relatives?
The Blossoms?

326
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,624
There's one last thing. When I was
at my lab, the morgue was broken into.

327
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,252
The body of the John Doe

328
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,630
and the severed limbs
of Lynette Fields were stolen.

329
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,965
They're covering their tracks.

330
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,718
They heard my mom on the news
and came here to steal the evidence.

331
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,888
- Like when our Mothman body was taken.
- Yes.

332
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,016
Yes, it is. Nana Rose gave us
that Mothman that was stolen.

333
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,353
Now your prime suspect tests positive
for Blossom DNA.

334
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,982
Lerman was held captive
by a Mothman near the Lonely Highway.

335
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,485
- They're connected. Their connection...
- Is the Blossoms.

336
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,989
You two go. I'm gonna get in touch
with Squeaky's family.

337
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:27,077
But, guys, when the time comes
to take these monsters down,

338
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,995
I want in.

339
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,500
Two miners,
Archie Andrews and Eric Jackson,

340
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,128
both Army veterans, remain unaccounted for

341
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,047
after the mine collapse
in Riverdale earlier today.

342
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,799
Relief efforts are underway.

343
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,843
The condition of the miners is not yet...

344
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,015
Oh, good. You're awake.

345
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,392
Mija?

346
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,854
Let's start with the obvious.
I know you're behind the mine explosion.

347
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,898
- Don't bother denying it.
- Untie me immediately.

348
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:02,321
It's ironic, I keep hearing
the words my guidance counselor said to me

349
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,822
way back in high school.

350
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,245
That our sick dance of death
could only end with one of us dying.

351
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,122
And now here we are.

352
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:16,626
Headed straight for an Oedipal tragedy,
set in motion when I was...

353
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,837
a 14-year-old girl.

354
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,006
Veronica, stop being so dramatic.

355
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,342
Oh, but this story is dramatic, Daddy.

356
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,470
The day of my quinceañera.

357
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,976
It was supposed to be...

358
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:39,775
the most important celebratory day
of my young life.

359
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,280
When I overheard you in your study,
talking with some of your friends,

360
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,200
telling them I was a disappointment.

361
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,831
That you wished Mom had given you a son
to follow in your footsteps.

362
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,546
How nice, you remember.

363
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,300
Do you know

364
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,304
what it does to a 14-year-old girl...

365
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,142
to hear that kind of dismissal
from her own father?

366
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:21,775
I've spent an entire lifetime
chasing your approval and love.

367
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:22,859
And for what?

368
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:27,030
Sociopaths are incapable of love.

369
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,918
Which is why I wanna be very clear
with you right now.

370
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,005
If Archie dies...

371
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,006
you die.

372
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,058
Can you feel it, Daddy?

373
00:23:56,643 --> 00:24:01,022
Our dance of death is finally coming
to an end.

374
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,569
Nana, we need to talk to you
about the Mothmen.

375
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,904
I've told you what I know.

376
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,658
Look at me. Look right at me.

377
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:12,868
Right now,

378
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,288
young women, including my sister,

379
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,207
who was a member of your family,

380
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,418
are being abducted,

381
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,254
tortured, and murdered.

382
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,718
So focus and answer our questions.

383
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:34,890
Right. You gave my friend and I
a corpse inside a maple barrel.

384
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,434
Who was it?

385
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,394
The truth, Nana.

386
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,188
I'm ashamed to admit it.

387
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,481
It was Cousin Timothy.

388
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:47,068
I came across his corpse
in the woods after he passed,

389
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,237
and I put him in a barrel.

390
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,324
Poor Timothy was born
with so many defects.

391
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,702
Okay. Cousin Timothy,
this is a blood relative of yours?

392
00:24:55,785 --> 00:25:00,165
My late husband was
a compulsive philanderer.

393
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,085
He made the beast with every woman
who worked on our estate.

394
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,546
The maids, the cooks, the nannies.

395
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,423
When they swelled with child,

396
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:11,843
he forced me to pawn them off
to avoid a scandal.

397
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:17,682
But I knew a barren couple
who lived in a cabin in the woods.

398
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,017
The Starkweathers.

399
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,894
I gave the children to them.

400
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,729
How many children in total?

401
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,775
Ooh, over the years, half a dozen.

402
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,695
The trucker that I caught,
he must have been one of them.

403
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,780
A Starkweather.

404
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,616
A Blossom, dear. In part.

405
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,158
Nana,

406
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,536
you're saying

407
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,166
there is a secret,
illegitimate clan of Blossoms

408
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,962
that have lived in the woods
for two generations?

409
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,589
Why did you call the corpse a Mothman?

410
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,633
The family kept to themselves,

411
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,511
didn't like eyes prying
into their business.

412
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,764
So they created a fiction,

413
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,808
the Mothmen,

414
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:04,145
one which we Blossoms were
all too eager to embrace.

415
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,440
Do they still live in the woods?

416
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,777
Oh, my, no.
They migrated from there to the mines.

417
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,990
And then when that closed down,
they moved closer to the highway.

418
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,577
Who else has been propagating
the Mothmen idea for decades?

419
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,914
- In plain sight, right off the highway?
- Old Man Dreyfuss.

420
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,793
Yes. Dreyfuss Starkweather, yes.

421
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,461
Is he still alive?

422
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,423
Oh, my God, Jug,
you and I have both been there.

423
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,883
Polly could have been there,
right under our noses.

424
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,596
It's Toni. There's an emergency.

425
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,053
Are you still with me, Jackson?

426
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,846
How...?

427
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,681
How we doing, sarge?

428
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,433
Not great.

429
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,727
We're losing a lot of oxygen.

430
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,438
And a lot of blood.

431
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,321
I have no idea
how we're gonna get out of here.

432
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,616
You don't really believe that,
do you, sergeant?

433
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,162
Bingo.

434
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,249
I thought we were square.

435
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,128
Apparently not.
Apparently, you need a kick in the ass.

436
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,674
You remember back at basic,
during our first PT test,

437
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,261
you did double the number of push-ups
or pull-ups as any other guy?

438
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,680
You don't have an ounce of quit in you!

439
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,433
Bingo, I'm only one man.

440
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,727
All due respect, sarge...

441
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,771
no, you're not.

442
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,191
Come on, guys. Double time.

443
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,985
Let's help the sergeant get him
and Corporal Jackson out.

444
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,916
Britta ran away last night.
Her mom called to see if she was here.

445
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,711
They got into a fight. When her mom went
to check on her, she was gone.

446
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,756
She left a note saying,
"Now you don't have to deal with me."

447
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,759
Did Britta give any indication
as to where she might have gone?

448
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,554
We called her friends.
No one knows anything.

449
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,682
If she's trying to get out of Riverdale
using the Lonely Highway,

450
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,059
we need to go to that junkyard ASAP.

451
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,354
- You know where the Highway Killer is?
- Killers, yeah. We think.

452
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,898
- But we need a team to go in with us.
- I wanna come.

453
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,902
Fangs, you stay here,
in case Britta comes back. Is that okay?

454
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,779
Um, not really, no.

455
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,990
Toni, you're a mother now.

456
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,993
You can't go out on crazy raids anymore...

457
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,536
I have to, Fangs.

458
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:10,123
Britta came to me for help,
and I saw myself in her.

459
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,624
As for Baby Anthony,

460
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,043
I don't want him to think
that his mom was a coward

461
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,046
and that I didn't do everything I could
to help somebody in need.

462
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,550
Besides, there's nobody better
to take care of him than you.

463
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,093
Than my mom, you mean?

464
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,430
'Cause if you're going on this raid,
I'm going with you.

465
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,349
I'll be watching your back. No discussion.

466
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,227
Well, how about we watch
each other's backs?

467
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,895
Deal.

468
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,192
Any luck finding a first aid kit in here?

469
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,651
I'm looking, sit down.

470
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:44,699
Veronica. You're stressed, you're injured,
you need to take a break.

471
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,868
Or at least go home, get cleaned up.

472
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,746
I can't go home.
Archie's trapped in a mine.

473
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,332
I know, but you will want
to be your gorgeous self

474
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,292
when Orpheus emerges from the underworld.

475
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,961
And probably not with an infected hand.

476
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,048
Trust me. Go get refreshed,
and I'll hold down the fort here.

477
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,635
And not to worry,
I've got some serious backup.

478
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,930
I call upon fire,

479
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,142
which consumed my brother's body
and mighty Thornhill once upon a time.

480
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,729
I call upon wind, as I have once before.

481
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,441
Blow a cool gust across Archie's brow.

482
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,321
I call upon water,

483
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,866
where I saw my departed brother
in the icy depths of Sweetwater River

484
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,912
and where I, myself, was reborn.

485
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,539
And lastly...

486
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,458
I call upon the earth.

487
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:41,005
Dear Gaia,
please return Archie and Eric to us.

488
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,465
Open a path for them,

489
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,968
so that they may return
to the land of the living.

490
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,543
Pippi, turn off all the lights
in the apartment.

491
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,965
Pippi, play Wagner.

492
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,342
Full volume.

493
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,375
Miss Veronica?

494
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,588
Pippi, lights on, music off.

495
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,672
Miss Veronica.

496
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,093
What happened?

497
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:51,928
Chad broke in...

498
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,180
and attacked me.

499
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,314
Cheryl, any news?

500
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,238
Came to finish the job?

501
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,493
I can't tell you
how tempting that proposition is.

502
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,664
Then again,
I've already seen blood spilt today.

503
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,249
Besides...

504
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,795
unlike you, I stick to my word.

505
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,006
I told you, you'd die if Archie did.

506
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,135
Well, he didn't, Daddy.

507
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:38,182
Archie is alive, above ground,
and waiting for me.

508
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,394
You failed, yet again.

509
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:47,608
You literally dropped a mountain on Archie
and still couldn't kill him.

510
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,735
You know...

511
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,447
I used to admire you...

512
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,197
grudgingly.

513
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,450
But I did.

514
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,246
But now you're just this...

515
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,165
silly cartoon.

516
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,629
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

517
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,466
'Cause you're no longer a threat to me.

518
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,969
But if you ever come after me
or Archie again,

519
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,679
you'll end up getting shot.

520
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,475
- Just like Chad did today.
- What?

521
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,144
Call Dr. Curdle for the details.

522
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,146
Bye, you little bitch.

523
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,693
Jughead, you're gonna distract Dreyfuss
while the rest of us search the junkyard.

524
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,863
If Britta is being kept in the place
my sister and Lerman were held,

525
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,866
we're looking
for some kind of windowless shed.

526
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:40,369
- You know how to use a stun gun?
- I'm from Chicago, yes.

527
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,413
- Jughead? You good?
- Yeah.

528
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,248
- I'm good.
- We're ready, then?

529
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:45,666
Jug, you're up.

530
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,586
The rest of us, let's split off,
so we can cover more ground.

531
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,841
You again.

532
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,178
Hey, Mr. Dreyfuss,
I'm so sorry to drop by unannounced.

533
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,805
I just got back into town.

534
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,183
I was hoping you and I could continue
our conversation about the Mothmen.

535
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,935
Let me grab some moonshine.

536
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:07,146
Actually, it's a little cold.
Mind if we talk inside?

537
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,608
Don't mind the mess.

538
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,203
- Live here alone?
- Yep. Just me.

539
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,372
No family, huh?

540
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,668
I thought
we were gonna discuss the Mothmen.

541
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:33,047
But they are your family,
aren't they, Mr. Starkweather?

542
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:38,177
I wondered
if we were gonna have trouble with you.

543
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,226
- How much have you figured out?
- Not all of it.

544
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,188
- Do you mind if I take a stab at it?
- Be my guest.

545
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,400
The Mothman corpse we had at Pop's,

546
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,696
that was, uh, Timothy, your half brother.

547
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,867
You took it. You must have overheard
Tabitha and I talking about it

548
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,162
when you came to pick up
your Thursday night order of pork chops.

549
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,664
And you did, we have receipts.

550
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,250
You also stole the bodies from the morgue.

551
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,128
It was another brother...

552
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,507
who swallowed his own tongue
just to keep your secret.

553
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,885
Which is what, to your thinking?

554
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,054
That you and your inbred brothers

555
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,766
drive up and down the Lonely Highway,
searching for women to murder.

556
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:31,147
Lerman, he was an outlier
because it's women that you're after.

557
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,608
Why?

558
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,277
To survive.

559
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:41,365
So we started going after the people
that no one would miss.

560
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,116
Runaways...

561
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,537
sex workers, drug addicts.

562
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:50,666
To, what, steal from them?
Those people couldn't have had much money.

563
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,418
You're right, of course.

564
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,545
But we don't need much to survive.

565
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,966
Anyway, after a while,
it wasn't about that.

566
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,220
It was about...

567
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,303
The hunt?

568
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,016
- The sport of it all?
- Yep.

569
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,894
So the Mothman story,
that was just a cover?

570
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,314
Just a spooky, little tale
to keep people away

571
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,149
from all the disappearances.

572
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:20,613
And if someone goes missing, then maybe
they were taken up in an alien spaceship.

573
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,617
People believe what they wanna believe.

574
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,078
Nobody cared about those girls.

575
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,540
You are so wrong about that.

576
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,835
- Britta?
- Miss Topaz?

577
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,672
I'm gonna get you out. Hold on.

578
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,232
Betty?

579
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,250
Wanna test that armor
against a point-blank shotgun blast?

580
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,838
Didn't think so.

581
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,566
Betty, are you okay?

582
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,862
- I heard you scream. What happened?
- We found Britta. She's fine.

583
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,780
- Scared but fine.
- Okay.

584
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:48,117
Remember what you told us about Lerman,
how a Mothman helped him escape?

585
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,371
Apparently, not all Starkweathers
are evil incarnate.

586
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,831
Oh, my God. Britta.

587
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,880
Oh, my God. Jughead.

588
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,218
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

589
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,763
He tried to chew his tongue off
and choke on it.

590
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,516
- Not before he answers our questions.
- Your hunting days are over, you sick...

591
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,686
How does it feel?

592
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,272
My foot? Like it's on fire.

593
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,442
The rest of me? Like I'm a complete ass.

594
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,737
Who would have known
we were walking into The Hills Have Eyes?

595
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,821
Toni...

596
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,285
we can do this, right?

597
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,622
Like, all of us?

598
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,207
Oh, yeah.

599
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,085
We got this.

600
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:44,215
You and me,
just watching each other's backs.

601
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,183
Not even the earth swallowing you whole

602
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,228
could keep us
from this moment, Archiekins.

603
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,525
Another brush with death
to add to your ever-growing list.

604
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,028
Your guardian angel deserves a raise.

605
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,072
More than one, Ronnie.

606
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:28,843
Mr. Starkweather,
I've spoken to my colleagues at the FBI,

607
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,720
and they'll be here soon to take you
and your brothers away.

608
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,765
But before that happens...

609
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:41,397
I would very much appreciate it
if you would tell me where my sister is.

610
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,361
Please tell me.

611
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,619
She's in the junkyard.

612
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,706
I can draw you a map.
