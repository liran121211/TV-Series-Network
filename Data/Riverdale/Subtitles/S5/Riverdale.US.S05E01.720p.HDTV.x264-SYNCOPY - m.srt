1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,367
<i>Previously, on</i>
<font color="#ffff00">"Riverdale"...</font>

2
00:00:01,438 --> 00:00:02,828
I just have to ask.

3
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:05,110
<i>When you were pretending
to be with Betty...</i>

4
00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:07,567
<i>you didn't feel anything,
did you?</i>

5
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:09,569
<i>I can't stop thinking
about you, Betty.</i>

6
00:00:09,654 --> 00:00:11,523
<i>I've tried,
but it's impossible.</i>

7
00:00:11,608 --> 00:00:13,193
<i>I wanted to share
something with you.</i>

8
00:00:13,278 --> 00:00:14,953
<i>It's a song I wrote for you.</i>

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,687
Stop. Whatever this is,
it's just over.

10
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:22,541
Hey, Mom, I'm ready to get
serious about the Naval Academy.

11
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:24,356
He's dying, Archie.

12
00:00:24,488 --> 00:00:26,323
And I don't know what to do.

13
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:29,991
- What is this?
- Footage of their houses

14
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:31,801
being watched
from across the street,

15
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:34,614
for hours upon hours.

16
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:36,153
Maybe it's just a prank.

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:38,044
This is clearly an escalation.

18
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:41,364
It's a warning or a promise
of violence to come.

19
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:43,563
This was on our doorstep.

20
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:44,981
Maybe it's another copycat?

21
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:46,700
I've seen this place before.

22
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:48,903
Oh, my God.

23
00:00:49,184 --> 00:00:51,137
Are they stabbing Mr. Honey?

24
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:02,582
Hey, did you
reach out to Mr. Honey?

25
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,817
We did, he's fine.
No one's tried to kill him.

26
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:06,317
Well, for now, at least.

27
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:09,997
In the meantime, you mind
breaking this down for me?

28
00:01:10,122 --> 00:01:11,443
Well, it's the Auteur again.

29
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:13,724
Seems like they've moved on
from recreating a killing

30
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:16,045
to re-enacting
a metaphoric murder.

31
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,440
Us and our friends
getting Mr. Honey fired.

32
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,941
And there is one other thing.

33
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:22,277
I wrote a story
Killing Mr. Honey,

34
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:25,196
within which was a
fictionalized version of this cabin.

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,698
I don't think
that's a coincidence.

36
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:30,442
All right, uh, who else knew
about that story?

37
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:31,620
- Just us.
- Yeah.

38
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:32,833
Me and Betty.

39
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:34,864
I mean, unless
I'm being watched or hacked.

40
00:01:35,332 --> 00:01:36,942
This is interesting.

41
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:39,294
It's four ticket stubs.

42
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,176
From, like,
the movie theater?

43
00:01:41,294 --> 00:01:42,797
Admission to watch the tapes?

44
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:45,614
Stubs have the letters
"B" and "V" on them.

45
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:48,466
The hell?
Like Betty and Veronica?

46
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:49,958
No, Blue Velvet.

47
00:01:50,222 --> 00:01:51,825
Like Blue Velvet Video?

48
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:54,498
As in the one place that all
roads keep coming back to,

49
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,376
that video store
and that crypt-keeper, David.

50
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,625
If he's not the Auteur, he's
connected to the Auteur somehow,

51
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:02,848
- or at least he's a fan.
- We'll bring him in.

52
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:06,112
I'll call you in the morning.
Get some rest.

53
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:07,940
Okay, good night.

54
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:16,778
Early morning run, Archiekins?

55
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:18,833
I got my physical for the
Naval Academy this week.

56
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:20,061
Well, I find it hard
to believe

57
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:22,895
they wouldn't be impressed
by my teenage Thor.

58
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:25,373
You could always serve
your country in the USO.

59
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,380
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, nothing.

60
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,559
This new song you've written.

61
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:35,469
- Oh.
- Mmm-hmm.

62
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,528
That is nothing. Just
something I'm kicking around.

63
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:41,887
Play it for me.

64
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,242
No, Ronnie,

65
00:02:44,326 --> 00:02:46,388
I stink and so does this song.

66
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:47,641
Trust me.

67
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,398
Okay.

68
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:52,216
I do like the idea of you
getting back into music, though.

69
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:55,627
Right now, my focus is on
impressing the Commandant.

70
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:56,898
And you will.

71
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:59,049
Because I'll be there
to make sure of it.

72
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,242
It's Daddy.

73
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:08,719
- He wants me home for breakfast.
- That's too bad...

74
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,704
'cause I was gonna ask you if
you wanted to join me in the shower.

75
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:36,305
Hey, there you are.
Come, sit, join us.

76
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:37,883
I have news.

77
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,664
Please don't tell me you and
Mom are chaperoning prom?

78
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:42,242
We are, but no.

79
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:44,468
My news is that
according to my doctor,

80
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:46,763
my core strength
is building back up.

81
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:50,672
In fact, my grip is almost as
strong as it was pre-diagnosis.

82
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:53,352
- What are you saying, Daddy?
- I'm beating it.

83
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,861
I'm beating this damn disease.

84
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:57,384
Honey, that's incredible.

85
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:00,336
It is, assuming it's true.

86
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:03,281
Forgive me
if I call your doctor

87
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:05,686
to confirm that this isn't
another one of your stories?

88
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:06,914
Fine.

89
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:10,094
Does he know why
you're bouncing back?

90
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,742
I've been trying this new workout
regimen that seems to be helping.

91
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:27,773
Thank you, Doctor. TTFN.

92
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,648
Well, it seems to be true.

93
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:35,164
Well, this calls
for celebration.

94
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,273
Cheers.

95
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:40,016
Salud.

96
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,594
Huh. He's not talking.

97
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:47,180
Unless you count movie quotes.

98
00:04:47,382 --> 00:04:50,326
Well, what did he have to say about
his store's initials on those ticket stubs?

99
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,242
- He's never seen them before in his life.
- Right.

100
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:57,000
You know, I don't know if this creep
is responsible for making the videos,

101
00:04:57,084 --> 00:05:00,253
but I can't shake the feeling that
somehow he is profiting off them.

102
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:01,656
Same.

103
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:03,715
Where's your partner-in-crime?

104
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,328
She's following up
on another lead.

105
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,012
What exactly are you
accusing me of, young lady?

106
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:11,514
I'm not accusing. I'm asking.

107
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:16,686
If I made a videotape of you and your
classmates murdering poor Mr. Honey?

108
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,647
Things haven't changed much,
I see.

109
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:22,025
- Mr. Weatherbee, you're back?
- Indeed.

110
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:24,528
Just in time for senior prom
and graduation.

111
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:28,266
How... How are you?

112
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:31,945
I told Edgar I wasn't the mole.
He cut it off.

113
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:35,400
I make it through most nights
without waking up screaming.

114
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:44,438
Two businesses? Another
besides this community center?

115
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:48,902
Yes, Commandant. Archie is also
the owner of Andrews Construction,

116
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:52,555
a business he inherited
after his father's passing.

117
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:57,672
Well, I have to say, I am truly
impressed by you, Mr. Andrews.

118
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:58,927
Thank you, sir.

119
00:05:59,012 --> 00:06:00,436
However,
when it seemed like you

120
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,946
were no longer
interested in the Academy,

121
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,949
I started looking
at other candidates to appoint.

122
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:06,885
Is there someone else
you're considering, sir?

123
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:09,281
Yes, a young man from Queens,

124
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:11,944
who's been training rigorously
for the Academy.

125
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:14,430
He's also a boxer like I was.

126
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:18,070
And, as you know, we have a
proud boxing tradition in the Navy.

127
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,839
I'm looking for a champion.

128
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:22,695
Crazy idea,

129
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,672
if you're considering Archie
and someone else,

130
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:28,091
how about deciding it
with an exhibition bout?

131
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:29,938
Right here at the El Royale.

132
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:32,688
You know, I do feel
that Archie and this young man are

133
00:06:32,773 --> 00:06:34,461
otherwise evenly matched.

134
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,173
Okay. I'll have my office
reach out to K.O. Kelly,

135
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:41,646
to see how quickly he can
hop a train to Riverdale.

136
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,690
Wait a minute. K.O. Kelly
is your other candidate?

137
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:46,192
Yes. Why? You know him?

138
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:47,914
Um, yes.

139
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:51,313
He's only dating
one of my BFFs, Katy Keene.

140
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:58,522
Well, Ms. Bell was a bust.

141
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:00,373
Yeah, well, Charles
didn't have much luck

142
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:02,164
with the video store's
owner, either.

143
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,460
You know, I do have an idea
of someone we could talk to

144
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:06,337
who might be able
to give us dirt on David.

145
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:09,424
The only caveat being
he's tried to kill me.

146
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:16,543
Our momentous best day
is almost upon us, T.T.

147
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:20,127
Can I ask, why do you want
to be prom queen so badly?

148
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:22,070
Want, T.T.?

149
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:24,532
Does Elizabeth want
to be the Queen of England?

150
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:27,745
A better question is why don't
you wanna be prom queen?

151
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:30,820
Listen,
if it's important to you,

152
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:32,508
it's important to me.

153
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:36,096
But the only royalty I care
about is being Serpent Queen,

154
00:07:36,326 --> 00:07:39,078
which I will be, again.
You'll see.

155
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey, Cheryl, Toni. Is this where
I sign up to run for prom person?

156
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:46,502
Oh, no, Kev, I don't think
you wanna do that.

157
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:50,381
Yeah, no, I don't, actually, but Fangs
has always wanted to be prom king,

158
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:51,924
- so here we are.
- Well.

159
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:53,387
I hate to rain
on Fangs' parade,

160
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,255
but Toni and I are campaigning
to be co-queens,

161
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:57,930
and it has been my destiny to
wear that prom crown since birth.

162
00:07:58,014 --> 00:08:01,642
I have spent my entire life
fantasizing about being prom queen,

163
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:04,395
and a part of that fantasy
is that I exist in a world

164
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,586
where everyone wants me
to be prom queen

165
00:08:06,723 --> 00:08:08,684
and certainly not themselves.

166
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,111
Does that make sense?

167
00:08:12,153 --> 00:08:14,363
Yeah. Yeah.

168
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:17,409
Thank you, Kevin. As my
friend, I knew you'd understand.

with your fight,

172
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:34,467
I've booked us the presidential
suite at the Five Seasons

173
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:37,762
for our apres-prom rendezvous.

174
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:39,722
It'll be just you, me,

175
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:43,267
a bathtub full of rose petals and...

176
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:45,394
K.O. Kelly!

177
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:47,813
- Ronnie.
- Hi.

178
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:49,315
Hey.

179
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,025
Welcome to Riverdale.

180
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:53,194
K.O., this is Archie Andrews.

181
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:55,321
- Archie, this is K.O. Kelly.
- Ah...

182
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:57,823
So, you're my competition.

183
00:08:57,907 --> 00:09:00,785
No offense, but are we
even in the same weight class?

184
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:03,746
I'm bigger
than I look, bro.

185
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,083
Boys, boys! Save the sparring
for the ring.

186
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,502
I promised Katy I'd show
K.O. a good time tonight.

187
00:09:09,586 --> 00:09:13,172
Yeah, I'm down. But first, Ronnie, do
you know where I can drop my stuff?

188
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:15,466
As a matter of fact, I do.

189
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,470
Archie has graciously agreed to have
you stay with him and train at his gym.

190
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:21,889
- I'm heading there now if you need a ride.
- All right.

191
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:22,973
Play nice, boys.

192
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:30,147
Well, well, well. Never
thought I'd see you two again.

193
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:32,316
What brings you
around these parts?

194
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,112
Look, Bret, we know you sold
your sex tapes to Blue Velvet Video.

195
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:39,699
Now, the owner, David, keeps
coming up in an ongoing investigation

196
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:41,993
that we're conducting,
but he's not talking to us.

197
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:44,371
We need a way in.
We need leverage.

198
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,791
Yeah. I know David.

199
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,335
But if he's not talking,
why should I?

200
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:54,171
See, I happen to have a friend
in there with you.

201
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:57,049
His name is War Baby. Mmm-hmm.

202
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:59,386
Do you know who he hates
more than anyone?

203
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:02,138
Preppies.

204
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:06,017
What's the investigation?

205
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,398
Someone is making videos
of us and our friends

206
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:15,651
doing disturbing,
violent things.

207
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:17,987
We think this David person
is connected to them.

208
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:21,198
Did he ever mention or host any
screenings with the videos in stock?

209
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:25,495
Some of David's customers
prefer... shared experiences.

210
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:28,664
Underground, immersive

211
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:30,141
red-band screenings.

212
00:10:30,226 --> 00:10:32,744
If we wanted to attend one of these
screenings, what would we need to do?

213
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:34,420
You'd have to be on the list.

214
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:38,507
Or you'd have to prove to David

215
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:39,718
that you're the real deal.

216
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:43,012
Bring him a tape.

217
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:44,847
Something to make him sit up

218
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:46,641
and take notice,

219
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:47,934
like, say, a snuff film.

220
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,568
Holy moly! That guy's
gotta have 50 pounds on you.

221
00:10:57,652 --> 00:11:00,112
Yeah, no joke.

222
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:01,822
What am I gonna do, Mr. Keller?

223
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:03,324
He's gonna cream me
tomorrow night.

224
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:05,409
Well, honestly, Archie,

225
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:08,705
I think a little psychological
warfare might be your best bet.

226
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:10,873
You're smaller than he is,

227
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:12,477
but I'm willing to bet
you're stronger.

228
00:11:15,336 --> 00:11:16,755
Let's go show 'em.

229
00:11:18,423 --> 00:11:20,800
- You got a mean left hook on you, K.O.
- Thanks.

230
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:22,635
Been punching bag
since I was a baby.

231
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:27,807
Look, I promised Ronnie
no betting on our actual match,

232
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:30,476
but how about you and me
make a little side bet?

233
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,771
That, pound for pound,
I'm stronger than you are.

234
00:11:34,272 --> 00:11:36,649
Unless you're too scared.

235
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:40,236
Twenty... 21...

236
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,573
27... 28... 29...

237
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:49,829
91... 92... 93...

238
00:11:49,913 --> 00:11:54,250
122... 123... 124...

239
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:58,213
129... 130...

240
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,549
131...

241
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:05,553
Okay, I'll admit it.
You got more endurance.

242
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:08,639
But when it comes to brute
power, we'll see who's stronger.

243
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:11,767
The Heavyweight Heartbreaker
or the Red Hope.

244
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:13,269
Yeah, we will.

245
00:12:13,353 --> 00:12:15,020
And tomorrow
your ass is grass.

246
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:18,484
But, tonight, Ronnie wants us
to show you a good time

247
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:19,809
so we're going
to her speakeasy.

248
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:22,153
Her what?

249
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:25,614
Okay, I know this is Riverdale,

250
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:27,152
but where do we get
a snuff film

251
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:29,535
in which someone
gets murdered on screen?

252
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:31,454
But those are just
urban legends, I thought.

253
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:34,373
Well, not according
to Nicolas Cage movies.

254
00:12:34,457 --> 00:12:36,876
- Maybe we can make one.
- A snuff film?

255
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,627
Well, a facsimile of one.

256
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:39,962
It just has to be
convincing enough

257
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:41,756
for David
to let his guard down.

258
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,924
We could even borrow the
equipment from the AV club.

259
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:47,219
And Jellybean probably still has that
fake blood left over from Halloween.

260
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:48,971
Who's our murderer?
Who's our victim?

261
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:51,975
We just need a brute
and a scream queen.

262
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:55,770
No, I won't help you.

263
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:58,647
No, no, Cheryl,
it's not an actual snuff film.

264
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:01,650
It's an act. It's a way
to get closer to the Auteur,

265
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:04,487
the person who's been creating
those re-enactment videos,

266
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:07,990
including the one
with Jason and your father.

267
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:11,327
I do want to expose
that defiler.

268
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:12,787
What's this movie about anyway?

269
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:15,623
Uh, it's a classic tale,
one as old as time.

270
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:19,168
Girl meets a boy, boy
promises to make girl a star,

271
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:22,254
and then the boy
kills the girl.

272
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:23,863
Charming.

273
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:26,290
Okay, but I'll need a wig.

274
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:28,829
I don't want anyone to recognize
me by my signature red mane.

275
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:29,999
Okay.

276
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:39,355
Well, how do I look?

277
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:41,398
Oh, my God,
you look incredible.

278
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:43,025
What about me?

279
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:45,097
Terrifying, Reg.

280
00:13:45,695 --> 00:13:48,197
- What happens next, Mr. De Palma?
- Yes.

281
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,949
Now, Reggie
is going to kill you

282
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:52,535
in the most brutally
exploitative way imaginable,

283
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:55,424
and I am going to film
the hell out of it.

284
00:14:05,008 --> 00:14:07,032
<i>Veronica speaking French...</i>

285
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:09,173
Is everyone
having a good time tonight?

286
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:16,224
Excellent.

287
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:19,081
In honor of my friend
K.O.'s visit,

288
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:22,015
I thought I'd share
a little tune for you tonight.

289
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:24,353
It was written by someone
very special to me.

290
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:27,372

You've got a big day tomorrow.

303
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:28,433
K.O., please tell Katy that I'm
sorry she's not gonna be here

304
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:31,311
when my boyfriend
beats up her boyfriend.

305
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:33,439
I'll let her know.

306
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,983
Good night.

307
00:15:37,526 --> 00:15:38,401
Good night.

308
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:39,614
Wait.

309
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:42,572
Yeah?

310
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:43,991
I love you.

311
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,013
I love you, too.

312
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:55,035
I have a proposal
I'd like to share with you.

313
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,710
I'd like us to host a din-din
before the dance.

314
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,660
I'm down. Who should we invite?

315
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:02,759
Mmm, the Vixens,

316
00:16:02,843 --> 00:16:07,806
- Kevin, Fangs...
- I was thinking our families.

317
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,261
Specifically yours, my love.

318
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:14,519
Cheryl, even though I'm out
to my grandparents

319
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:16,878
and I'm their
favorite grandchild,

320
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:21,223
I don't think they can handle
some big gay prom dinner party.

321
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:23,011
Well...

322
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:26,339
what happens when I meet them
at graduation?

323
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,148
Do I just pretend like
you're not my girlfriend?

324
00:16:32,373 --> 00:16:34,809
Honestly, that's probably
a good idea.

325
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,581
T.T., you can't be serious.

326
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:40,589
I know it's crazy
and backwards,

327
00:16:40,673 --> 00:16:42,769
but that's my reality, babe.

328
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:49,306
Hey, I'm curious, Archie.

329
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:51,543
What made you seek out
the Naval Academy?

330
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:54,566
Well, all my friends
applied to college.

331
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:57,683
I kind of missed the boat
on that.

332
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,097
And I got a second chance
with the Commandant.

333
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:05,831
The Academy, it feels like it
could be a good place to start over.

334
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:07,198
Completely.

335
00:17:07,282 --> 00:17:08,325
Well...

336
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:10,327
not completely.

337
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,230
You and Ronnie are in it
to win it, Katy says.

338
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,542
I don't know, bro,
sometimes I worry

339
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:19,044
that I'm holding her back,
you know?

340
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:20,128
I feel you.

341
00:17:21,505 --> 00:17:25,294
But that is
for the ladies to decide,

342
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,507
not lugs like us.

343
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:30,305
We lucked out.

344
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,893
Good night, bro.

345
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:46,426
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Kev.

346
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:48,481
We have a favor to ask.

347
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:51,368
We are trying to sell a
snuff film to this video store,

348
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:54,329
but I can't go in there because
the owner's gonna recognize me

349
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:56,915
from the time I raided
the place with the FBI.

350
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:58,875
But I don't want Betty
to go in alone, so...

351
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,378
- You had me at snuff film.
- Thank you, Kev.

352
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:03,672
We just have to
stop by my house.

353
00:18:03,756 --> 00:18:05,882
I need to grab a backup,
just in case.

354
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,012
Cool.

355
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:14,808
I need to talk to you
about something, Nana,

356
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:17,558
and I'm really hoping
that you'll keep an open mind.

357
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,761
I think I know
what this is about.

358
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:23,496
Your girlfriend stopped by
for a visit, Antoinette.

359
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:25,879
My girlfriend did? What?

360
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:28,785
When were you gonna tell me
that you were dating a Blossom?

361
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:32,242
Nana, it's not what you think.

362
00:18:32,326 --> 00:18:34,119
Cheryl isn't what you think.

363
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:37,789
That family, over the decades,
has taken everything from us.

364
00:18:37,873 --> 00:18:41,084
- And from our people.
- That's ancient history.

365
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:43,920
And I promise you Cheryl
is nothing like her family.

366
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:49,426
If that's true, then why have you
kept her hidden like a dirty secret?

367
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,162
It's because you know
it's wrong.

368
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:53,596
No, it's because I knew this
would be your irrational reaction.

369
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,099
About this? Yes.

370
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:58,602
I will not allow you
to date a Blossom.

371
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:05,775
You look familiar to me.

372
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:09,571
Both of you do.
You come in here before?

373
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:11,489
- Nope, never, shockingly.
- Mmm-mmm.

374
00:19:11,573 --> 00:19:15,618
A classmate of mine from prep
school said that you buy videos.

375
00:19:15,702 --> 00:19:18,037
Underground videos.

376
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,707
My friend and I saw this video
at a party last weekend.

377
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:25,295
And we boosted it. It's of
a girl getting killed for real.

378
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:26,880
A snuff film.

379
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:29,591
Let me take a look.

380
00:19:42,437 --> 00:19:45,982
Sorry, kids, you were conned.

381
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:48,026
Or you're trying to con me.

382
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,403
But this snuff is a fake.

383
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:54,741
We were worried that this tape might
not be authentic, so I brought a backup

384
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:57,953
that I know for a fact
is the real deal.

385
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:06,711
I'm making
this movie so we never forget

386
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:08,838
what your daddy
sacrificed for us.

387
00:20:08,922 --> 00:20:10,715
You do love your daddy,
don't you, Harold?

388
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,218
- Yes, Mommy.
- What is this?

389
00:20:13,302 --> 00:20:15,136
And you want your daddy
to keep living with us?

390
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,763
The birth of a serial killer.

391
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:17,889
Yes, Mom.

392
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:20,348
The Black Hood as a little boy.

393
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:22,435
Is that really him?

394
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,729
- The Black Hood?
- Yeah.

395
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:26,316
That's my dad.

396
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:28,481
This is insane.

397
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:35,089
Could I screen this at a little
film festival/rave I'm organizing?

398
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:40,036
Yeah, as long as
we're invited to the screening.

399
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:44,167
<i>because we don't want Daddy
to be taken away from us, do we?</i>

400
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:46,094
<i>- No.
- But you,</i>

401
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:49,644
<i>you will do better.
You must do better.</i>

402
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:09,951
That a boy. Go get him, Arch.

403
00:21:25,268 --> 00:21:28,520
Welcome to
the Film Society, girlie.

404
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:32,608
We got your daddy's movie
playing in Room 317.

405
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:49,792
Welcome to the Film Society.

406
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:52,544
My dad's playing
in Room 317, apparently.

407
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:53,955
Awesome.

408
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:13,651
So, what exactly are we
supposed to be looking for here?

409
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,403
To see if any of the Auteur's
movies are playing

410
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:19,489
or if any of these people
are fans of his.

411
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:32,084
Let me just get
a lay of the land first.

412
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:06,994
<i>Can you
do that, Harold? Convince him?</i>

413
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,851
<i>You're a good boy, Harold.</i>

414
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,459
<i>Your father made a mistake.
But you, you will do better.</i>

415
00:23:13,543 --> 00:23:15,363
<i>You must do better.</i>

416
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:16,778
- Betty.
- Hmm..

417
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:47,010
These are
all the Auteur's films.

418
00:23:47,104 --> 00:23:49,307
Well, then
he's gotta be in here.

419
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,794
Do you know who the director
of this is?

420
00:23:59,297 --> 00:24:00,965
Do you know who the director
of this...

421
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,134
Are you the director?

422
00:24:04,218 --> 00:24:06,929
- Hey!
- Oh, I'm actually such a big fan.

423
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,847
- If I'm lucky, I'll get an autograph.
- Who is that?

424
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:11,971
Ponytail Playmate.
You're even hotter in person.

425
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:19,608
Whoa, whoa, hey!

426
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,360
Jug, we're leaving, we're
leaving, we're leaving.

427
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:22,706
Go, go, go.

428
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:27,403
Here.

429
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,868
Give me
two big breaths.

430
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:34,560
Jug, look.

431
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:39,253
Oh, that's him.
That's gotta be him.

432
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,443
Come on, Arch!

433
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,356
- Jellybean?
- Jughead?

434
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:05,388
Betty, go. Let me stay
with Jellybean. Go, after him!

435
00:25:07,531 --> 00:25:09,324
-What are you doing here?
Doing here?

436
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,827
My friends and I heard
there was a party.

437
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,453
Am I in trouble?

438
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:15,457
No, no, you're not in trouble.
Come on, let's go.

439
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,419
Stop, stop, stop!

440
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:22,046
Fight's over.

441
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,307
Ladies and gentlemen, the
first judge has scored the fight

442
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:35,903
in favor of K.O. Kelly.

443
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:42,441
Our second judge has scored
the fight for Archie Andrews.

444
00:25:45,486 --> 00:25:48,247
And our third judge,
the Commandant,

445
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:53,410
has scored the fight in favor

446
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:55,203
of K.O. Kelly,
your winner tonight.

447
00:26:09,927 --> 00:26:11,470
You're a hell
of a fighter, Archie.

448
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:14,640
I'll tell you what,
why don't we stay in touch,

449
00:26:14,724 --> 00:26:17,476
and, come fall,
you reapply to the Academy,

450
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,716
we'll see if we can't
make it happen for you then.

451
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,138
No, thanks, I'm good.

452
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:23,568
Archie, don't be disrespectful.

453
00:26:23,653 --> 00:26:26,583
Your blood's still boiling.
I understand, son.

454
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:28,820
I'm not your son.

455
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:31,075
And I'm not applying
to your school again.

456
00:26:39,255 --> 00:26:41,124
Cheryl, what the hell
did you do?

457
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,709
What the hell, indeed, Toni.

458
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:44,044
I thought you didn't want
me to meet your nana

459
00:26:44,128 --> 00:26:45,420
because I'm a lesbian.

460
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,506
But, surprise!
It's me and my family

461
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,591
she hates
with a fiery vengeance.

462
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:52,094
Cheryl, you have to admit that
your ancestors were horrible to mine.

463
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:55,097
And now, my nana is begging
me not to go to prom with you.

464
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:57,683
She says that it would
dishonor our family.

465
00:26:57,767 --> 00:27:04,356
Look, I'm truly, truly sorry
I went to see your nana.

466
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,026
But I really hope we're still
going to prom together, T.T.

467
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,863
I hope that when I'm posing
for pictures in my amazing dress,

468
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:15,727
that you're there with me,
looking equally undeniable.

469
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:24,042
How did you even know
where to go, Jellybean?

470
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:26,878
My friend, Lauren, from soccer.

471
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:28,959
Her older brother
heard about a rave.

472
00:27:29,044 --> 00:27:31,787
- From who?
- I don't know. He's on some email list.

473
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:35,803
Jug, I swear, I've never been
to a rave before.

474
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,341
Will you just promise me
you're not gonna go

475
00:27:37,474 --> 00:27:40,561
to any more X-rated raves
from now on?

476
00:27:40,646 --> 00:27:42,858
Especially if I end up
in the University of Iowa.

477
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:44,764
- Okay?
- Yes.

478
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:47,700
- You promise me?
- I promise.

479
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,981
Archie.

480
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,617
I'm sorry about the fight.

481
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:14,216
I wish I hadn't suggested it.

482
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:17,599
And I know
this sucks right now,

483
00:28:18,735 --> 00:28:21,646
but the Naval Academy
wasn't your only option.

484
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:23,567
Yeah, it kinda was, Ronnie.

485
00:28:23,652 --> 00:28:25,904
Hey, listen.

486
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,255
Do you wanna blow off prom?

487
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,518
We could do something.

488
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:34,716
Anything you want.
Just the two of us.

489
00:28:35,044 --> 00:28:37,544
No, this will be the last dance
we have with our friends.

490
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:40,263
Can't miss it.

491
00:28:42,315 --> 00:28:43,733
Are you sure, Archie?

492
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:46,542
I'm in.

493
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:02,732
I still wanna take a picture
of you, dear.

494
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:05,481
You look like an angel.

495
00:29:05,566 --> 00:29:07,599
Thank you, Nana.

496
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,372
Perhaps your camera will capture
the sublime tragedy of my life.

497
00:29:12,532 --> 00:29:15,743
- Okay.
- Don't start crying yet, Cheryl.

498
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:18,271
Toni, you came.

499
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:21,582
Was there ever any doubt?

500
00:29:26,754 --> 00:29:27,963
Ready?

501
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:34,013
Oh, that's nice.

502
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:37,394
Looking sharp, Archie.

503
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,443
Thank you, sir.

504
00:29:40,064 --> 00:29:42,989
You know, uh, Veronica told me
about the Naval Academy.

505
00:29:43,229 --> 00:29:45,185
- Unlucky break.
- It wasn't meant to be.

506
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:46,950
Well, look, um...

507
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:49,446
if you decide to stay
in Riverdale, Archie,

508
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:52,104
it just so happens
I'm in need of a deputy mayor

509
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:53,887
to oversee community outreach.

510
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:55,693
I think
you'd be perfect for it.

511
00:29:58,744 --> 00:30:01,455
Well, Archiekins,
what do you think?

512
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,841
Am I dazzling?

513
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,168
Wow.

514
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:14,760
Okay, you two, snuggle up
for a picture.

515
00:30:14,844 --> 00:30:17,450
This is a memory you're
going to treasure forever.

516
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:19,052
Smile and say, "Endgame."

517
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,265
Three, two, one...

518
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,722
Damn, boy, you're handsome.

519
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:28,690
Like father, like son.

520
00:30:28,774 --> 00:30:31,177
Oh, my gosh. Betty.

521
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,583
Betty Cooper,
you take my breath away.

522
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,622
Jughead Jones,
the feeling's mutual.

523
00:30:49,545 --> 00:30:51,310
Okay, guys, picture time.

524
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:55,374
Smile.

00:31:46,848 --> 00:31:49,475
to surviving this crazy town

538
00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:52,300
and making it a night
that we'll never forget.

539
00:31:52,385 --> 00:31:54,512

Happy prom night, lover.

542
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:13,170
Did you and Daddy
have a nice chat?

543
00:32:13,254 --> 00:32:15,797
Did you know he was gonna
ask me to be his deputy mayor?

544
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:18,050
He might've mentioned it.

545
00:32:18,134 --> 00:32:20,302
But did he tell you
about my big idea?

546
00:32:20,386 --> 00:32:21,887
No.

547
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:24,514
I'm going to defer Barnard
for a year

548
00:32:24,598 --> 00:32:26,934
so you and I can work together,
side by side.

549
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,478
Ronnie...

550
00:32:29,562 --> 00:32:32,564
No, I... I don't think
that's a good idea.

551
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:35,734
I couldn't live with myself if I knew
I was holding you back that way.

552
00:32:35,818 --> 00:32:37,361
But you're not.

553
00:32:37,445 --> 00:32:39,905
I'm choosing to be with you.
This is my decision.

554
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:42,491
I'd be dragging you down.
I don't want that.

555
00:32:42,575 --> 00:32:45,160
I'd rather lose
one meaningless year

556
00:32:45,244 --> 00:32:47,496
than be out of sync with you,
maybe forever.

557
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,839
Ronnie, I wrote that song
for Betty.

558
00:32:58,588 --> 00:33:00,232
Come again?

559
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:05,278
The song that you found
and sang at the speakeasy.

560
00:33:07,657 --> 00:33:09,161
It was for Betty.

561
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:13,314
I don't understand.

562
00:33:15,172 --> 00:33:17,052
- Did you guys...
- We kissed.

563
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:19,911
Hedwig,

564
00:33:20,237 --> 00:33:23,407
but that's it, and we didn't
wanna hurt you and Jughead.

565
00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:29,547
Well, the votes have been tallied
and double-checked by Ms. Bell.

566
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:33,693
It is now my honor to announce
this year's prom king and queen.

567
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:40,799
Actually, make that
prom queens.

568
00:33:40,883 --> 00:33:43,233
Congratulations
to Miss Cheryl Blossom

569
00:33:43,318 --> 00:33:44,970
and Miss Antoinette Topaz.

570
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:49,123
Your new prom queens,
let's hear it!

571
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,685
Mr. Weatherbee,
fellow classmates,

572
00:33:56,956 --> 00:33:59,207
tonight, Toni and I
are being named

573
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:02,568
Riverdale High's first
openly gay royal couple.

574
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:06,747
However, no queenship is
complete without their court.

575
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:10,193
So would my dear cousin
Betty Cooper, Jughead Jones,

576
00:34:10,278 --> 00:34:12,154
Veronica Lodge

Did they just kill that guy
from Blue Velvet Video?

594
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:10,631
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

595
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,772
What the hell just happened?

596
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:23,086
Well, we didn't get to finish
our ceremonial dance,

597
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,295
but we did win our crowns.

598
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:28,925
Come, fair T.T.,
our carriage is waiting

599
00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:31,139
to whisk us back
to Thistlehouse.

600
00:36:34,014 --> 00:36:35,546
What's wrong, my sugarplum?

601
00:36:35,631 --> 00:36:37,779
I can't go home
with you, Cheryl.

602
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,006
Because of your nana.

603
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,842
But I don't understand.
I thought you picked me.

604
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,553
For tonight, I did.

605
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:48,091
My nana said that if I
didn't get home by midnight,

606
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:50,094
that she would never
speak to me again.

607
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,907
I hope you can understand.

608
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,410
Of course, Toni.

609
00:36:55,494 --> 00:36:59,576
Family is
the most important thing.

610
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:02,998
Go and be with your nana.

611
00:37:04,628 --> 00:37:06,467
And thank you for tonight.

612
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:10,070
Despite those moments
of video horror,

613
00:37:10,342 --> 00:37:12,858
I will treasure these memories.

614
00:37:13,387 --> 00:37:14,756
Always.

615
00:37:15,472 --> 00:37:17,140
Thank you, Cheryl.

616
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,608
I'm sure we'll be able
to work it out.

617
00:37:19,852 --> 00:37:22,639
- She just needs time, okay?
- Okay.

618
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:35,006
I don't wanna finish
this conversation, Archie.

619
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:37,895
But we have to.

620
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:40,576
I know.

621
00:37:41,189 --> 00:37:44,702
Did Betty tell Jughead about
what happened between you two?

622
00:37:44,787 --> 00:37:45,996
No.

623
00:37:49,178 --> 00:37:50,928
We both swore we wouldn't.

624
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,631
Well, we should keep it
that way.

625
00:37:58,787 --> 00:38:00,733
No need to blow them up, too.

626
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:04,951
I agree.

627
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:12,779
So, what do we do now?

628
00:38:15,714 --> 00:38:18,091
Clearly, our last two weeks
of high school

629
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:20,514
are going to be fraught.

630
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:23,131
And I don't want them

631
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,147
overshadowed by...

632
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:28,134
this.

633
00:38:30,383 --> 00:38:32,756
So, after graduation,

634
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:37,177
we go our separate ways,
Archie.

635
00:38:37,262 --> 00:38:38,889
No big drama,

636
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:41,436
no fireworks,

637
00:38:43,516 --> 00:38:45,852
I'll go to Barnard,

638
00:38:47,815 --> 00:38:50,484
and you do whatever
feels right to you.

639
00:39:15,577 --> 00:39:17,361
Where did they go?

640
00:39:17,597 --> 00:39:20,205
- Where's the creepy video store guy?
- And our doppelgangers.

641
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,624
Why does every one
of our dances

642
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,501
turn into
a Jamie Lee Curtis movie?

643
00:39:37,473 --> 00:39:38,826
Veronica?

644
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:42,444
What's wrong?

645
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:45,467
Was it that horrible video?

646
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:49,027
No.

647
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,467
It's not that, Mom. Um...

648
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,967
Something happened
between Betty and Archie.

649
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,069
Oh, honey.

650
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,404
I'm so sorry.

651
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:10,535
It's okay.

652
00:40:13,593 --> 00:40:15,115
It'll be okay.

653
00:40:19,015 --> 00:40:21,350
There, there, my child.

654
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:25,105
It shall all be fine
in the end.

655
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:28,623
- Not this time, Nana.
- Oh.

656
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:32,459
Today, I realized Toni and I
won't end up together.

657
00:40:32,654 --> 00:40:36,074
Once again, I'm a victim
of this family's curse.

658
00:40:37,784 --> 00:40:39,870
I can no longer outrun
my fate.

659
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,044
I am a Blossom...

660
00:40:43,925 --> 00:40:45,584
destined to be alone.

661
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:51,398
We got an APB out for David.

662
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:54,258
If he's behind the videos
and he is fleeing,

663
00:40:54,342 --> 00:40:57,593
- he's not gonna get far.
- Okay, but what if he wasn't the Auteur

664
00:40:57,678 --> 00:40:59,029
and he was really killed?

665
00:40:59,114 --> 00:41:02,058
Well, then, the video shown at
prom was an actual snuff film.

666
00:41:02,142 --> 00:41:04,185
What do we do?
We do?

667
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:08,014
- Continue our search for David.
- Or wait for the next video to drop.

668
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:11,529
Pray that it's not the straw
that breaks the camel's back.
