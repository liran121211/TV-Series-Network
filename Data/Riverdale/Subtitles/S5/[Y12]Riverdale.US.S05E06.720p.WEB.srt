00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,009
Well, Jug,

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,344
you ever think we'd have
a night before the first day
of school again.

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,930
No, not in a million years.

00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,975

00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,149
Well, I'm gonna hit the sack.
Big day tomorrow.

You know after all these years,

11
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,660
it's still kind of adorable
to witness your
back-to-school jitters.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,370
Well, I'd be there already

13

Well, as long as you're
taking it seriously.

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,898
We will absolutely talk about
my experiences overseas,

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,775
but the RROTC's focus

37
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,694
is on physical fitness,
and military history.

38
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:55,240
So I'll ask again,
what year was the
United States Army founded?

39
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,992
So this semester
our main project in Shop Class

40
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,787
will be taking apart
this classic car.

41
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,624
A 1954 Crestline
and putting it back together.

42
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,751
Any questions
before we get started?

43
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,963
Wasn't your dad
like the Black Hood?

00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,048
He was.

45
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,384
As a matter of fact,
he taught me everything
I know about cars.

46
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,970
So, any relevant questions?

47
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,349
[Jughead] Who did
the summer reading?

48
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,355
Who can tell me what it was?

49
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,111
This is gonna be great.

50
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,907
[Hiram] By all rights,
that school
should be shut down.

51
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,244
Instead, I'm told
there are over
100 students enrolled.

52
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,912
What do you care, Mr. Lodge?

53
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,706
You got what you wanted.

54
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,876
Riverdale doesn't even exist
since you unincorporated it.

55
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,504
Reggie, a high school
offers hope,

56
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,632
and people are sentimental
about Riverdale High

57
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,426
for reasons that elude me.

58
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,678
And as long as it remains open,
there's a slight chance

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,142
the town will grow
back around it like a weed.

60
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,561
And that
is bad for our business.

61
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,063
I hear you.

62
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,440
So what are you thinking, boss?

63
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,279
As you can see,
this used to be a video store
back in the day,

64
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,115
but with a little TLC,

65
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,035
it'll be the perfect spot
for my new jewelry store.

66
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:26,039
I cut my teeth
in the Diamond District
as you know, Smithers.

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,458
I think I could bring
a little Manhattan magic
to this town

formerly known as Riverdale
in the form of exquisitely
high end bling.

69
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:37,342
And will Mr. Gekko, be involved
in this business enterprise?

70
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,969
I haven't decided yet.

71
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,473
He knows I'm in Riverdale,
teaching temporarily,

72
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,434
but the permanence
of opening a shop,

73
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,894
might send him spiraling.

74
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,607
Well, Miss Cooper...

75
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,859
how was the first day?

76
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,988
Well, they're terrified of me.

77
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,407
Being that I'm the daughter
of the Black Hood and all.

78
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,701
Oof. That sucks.

79
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,872
Yeah. On top of which I can't
stop thinking about Polly.

80
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,832
Didn't your mom say
she does this sometimes?

then reappears.

82
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,544
Yeah, that's why
I'm trying not to panic.

83
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,343
Well, in the meantime,
maybe I can distract you.

working at Pop's.

85
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,850

I have a crazy idea.

to come run Pop's?

You must have had every CEO
offer that you wanted.

101
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,903
Or I could become the CEO
of my family business

102

at my fancy schools

103

173
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,784
Plan B. Pop quiz.

174
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,415
Hand these out.

175
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,966
Supply and demand

176
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,594
is the foundational principle
of economics.

177
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,304
So I'm going to make sure
that you all--

178
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,016
Special delivery
for Miss Gekko.

179
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,728
Chad, what are you doing here?

180
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,146
Surprising my wife.

181
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,731
But I'm in the middle
of a class.

182
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,482
I'll just wait
quietly at the back.

183
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,156
[Veronica exhales]

184
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,914
[Archie] Mr. Weatherbee.
Uh, Waldo.

185
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,333
I want to bring
Bulldog football

186
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,335
back to Riverdale High
as a coach,

187
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,087
I think having a football team
would be huge for school pride

188
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,422
and would help bring

189
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,381
what's left of this town
back together.

190
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,760
You know where
we're at financially.

191
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,386
I'll get the money somehow.

192
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,554
We even have enough players?

193
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,931
I only need eleven.

194
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,268
All right, Mr. Andrews.
Let's see what you can do.

195
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,982
[Chadwick] As you can imagine,
my wife tells this guy

196
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,234
exactly where he can
stick his designer loafers.

197
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,361
[all laughing]

198
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,991
Archie, This is Chadwick,
my husband.

199
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,451
He surprised me with a visit...

200
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,994
[Kevin] ...and some
delicious cupcakes.

201
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,205
[Chadwick] So you're
the famous Archie.

202
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,582
Nice to meet you.

203
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,839
[Toni] Well, we've survived
two days of the school year.

204
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,008
How about we
celebrate tonight?

205
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,885
It's karaoke Tuesday
at the Whyte Wyrm.

206
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,720
Obviously, I'll be
defying gravity.

207
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,181
As long as I can
get a vodka tonic,
I will be watching.

208
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,349
I don't know if we...

209
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,684
That sounds good.

210
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,061
[surprised] What?
You hate karaoke.

211
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,355
[Chadwick] What's that
expression, uh, when in Rome,

212
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,691
embarrass yourself
in front of a group
of total strangers?

213
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,323
[Toni] Betty, do you
have a minute?

214
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,075
Sure. What's up?

215
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,078
Earlier, Kevin mentioned
that your sister's missing.

216
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,330
Yeah. Why? Have you
heard something?

217
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,082
Well, you know how Fangs
and some of the other Serpents

218
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,250
are truckers now?

219
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,335
Yeah.

220
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,212
Well, I asked around,
and some of the guys

221
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,339
have occasionally
seen Polly

222
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,258
hanging out
at this sketchy truck stop

223
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,968
right off
the Lonely Highway.

224
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,594
[Betty] Doing what?

225
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,055
Dealing for the Ghoulies
or hooking up with truckers.

226
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,057
[Betty sighs] Or both.

227
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,143
[Toni sighs] Yeah.
Well, sadly,

228
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,604
Polly's not the only
young woman in Riverdale
making a living that way.

229
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,149
Fangs said that
some of the truckers
arrange meetings

230
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,485
with these women
by posting on Nedslist.

231
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,154
I don't know
if Polly has an account.

232
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,655
Yeah, Okay.
Thank you, Toni.

233
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,365
I'll look into it.

234
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:25,786
Do you know where exactly
this truck stop is?

235
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,246
The thing is,
Miss Blossom,

236
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,873
the men have been
threatening to quit.

237
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,125
[Cheryl] Under
no circumstances.

238
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,127
Constant hammering of nails
and buzzing of saws

239
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,629
is the only thing that quiets
my troubled soul.

240
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,339
Tell your brutes
they'll get their blood money

241
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,383
and a bonus
for their patience.

242
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,845
Now be gone from my sight.

243
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,935
Thanks to that
charitable donation

244
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,604
Toni squeezed out of me,

245
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,648
the Blossom coffers
are empty, Nana.

246
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,443
It's time
for Operation Goldfinch.

247
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,403
Call Krespy's
and have him send
an appraiser over

248
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,822
whilst I finish my copy
of this portrait of Jay-Jay.

249
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,867
[sighs] And pray my subterfuge

250
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,494
will save us
from financial ruin.

251
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,959
[Betty] According to my mom,
Polly doesn't have a laptop,

252
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,461
-but I asked the twins...
-[Kevin sighs]

253
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,213
...and they said,
sometimes, she uses theirs.

254
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,715
So Polly doesn't have
a Nedslist account.

255
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,217
But Patty does.

256
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,552
[Kevin] Oh, my God.
Check sent messages.

257
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,221
Who was the last person
she contacted?

258
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,974
Someone named
"TruckerBoy69".

259
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,852
And apparently,
they arranged to meet up
the night she disappeared.

260
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,481
Okay, so, either
he knows something,
or he did something.

261
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,025
Send him a message
asking to get together again.

262
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,487
[Betty typing]

263
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,822
Okay. Sent.

264
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,785
Okay. Now we just wait,
I guess.

265
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,328
Can we karaoke
while we wait?

266
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,459
[all] Cheers!

269
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,553
By the way, Jones,

270
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,513
I have the next subject
for your book.

271
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,265
[Tabitha] A real character.

272
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,432
Oh, yeah? Who's that?

273
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,768
Old Man Dreyfus.

274
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,187
Lives on and runs a junk yard
off the Lonely Highway.

275
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,981
He came in today
for a plate of pork chops

276
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,025
and I asked if you could
interview him for your book.

277
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,193
He said yes.

278
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,695
Did you get his number?

279
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,114
Oh, no. [laughs]
Dreyfus does not have a phone,

280
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,657
but I do have
his address, though.

281
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,117
Okay, what's his story?

282
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,494
Oh, you've gotta
ask him about "The Mothman."

283
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,455
-The Mothman?
-[Tabitha] Mmm-hmm.

284
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,999
[Toni on mic]
All right, all right!

285
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,794
We've got a special treat
for you guys.

own this place
back in the day.

forgot it's Gekko now.

One more
is all I needed.
What's your name, bro?

346
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,085
I'm Britta.
Is that cool?

347
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,213
As long as you don't mind

348
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,589
playing both sides
of the ball, Britta,

349
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,507
you complete my team.

350
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,718
Now I just need funding.

351
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,263
How much funding?

352
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,389
Twenty thousand.

353
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,600
There's gotta be
some kind of sports budget.

354
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,061
There is, but the little money
that's available

355
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,522
is already been earmarked
for something else.

356
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,315
What about Cheryl?
Can you ask her?

357
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,650
No way.

358
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,277
I already called in
my one favor.

359
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,653
Nobody's stopping you.

360
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,323
[Cheryl] You need more money
from me, you say?

361
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:22,161
Yes, for the football team.

362
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,496
Well, I've already
done my part for the school

363
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,540
and at a great
personal cost.

364
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,459
Cheryl, I just thought...

365
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,922
[sighs] given the fact
your brother was a Bulldog,

366
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,134
that you might want
to honor him.

367
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,468
How dare you
play my brother

368
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,179
as if he were
a red king card, Archie?

369
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,763
[Cheryl] Be gone!

370
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,640
And never darken the halls
of Thornhill again.

371
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,643
Leave!

372
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,031
When did the Krespy's
appraiser say he was
coming again, Nana?

373
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:05,537
Oh, she, dear. Minerva Marble,
and, um, tomorrow, she said.

374
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,583
Truckrboy69
responded.

375
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,460
He said, "So good to hear
from you, Patty.

376
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,378
I was afraid you were
still mad at me.

377
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,380
How's tonight?"

378
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,758
-Mad about what?
-That's exactly what
I'm going to find out

379
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,801
when you and I go
stakeout the truck stop,

380
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,512
he suggested, right off
exit 42.

381
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,317
[owl hooting]

382
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,920
Hi, there. I'm Jughead Jones.
I work at Pops with
Tabitha Tate.

383
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:59,049
She told me that you'd be
that you'd be willing to tell
me the story about the, uh,

384
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,467
Mothmen.

385
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:09,851
[Dreyfuss] About thirty,
forty years ago, me
and some buddies got hired

386
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:13,647
to dig out a collapsed
mine not far off
the Lonely Highway.

387
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,400
One night, we went to bed.

388
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,486
The next morning when we
woke up, one of the guys,

389
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,655
Ramos was missing.

390
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,783
We worked he whole day
but Ramos never showed.

391
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,159
Until the next morning

392
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,913
when Ramos was back,

393
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,957
but Raymond was missing.

394
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:37,546
Ramos told us that some
Mothmen had taken him
up in their ship,

395
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,672
and now they had Raymond.

396
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,050
Did you believe him?

397
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,927
Not at first.

398
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,055
[Dreyfuss] But the next
morning, Raymond
was back.

399
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,266
But Arnold was missing.

400
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,228
And sure enough, Raymond
said the Mothmen had
taken him up in their ship.

401
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:59,234
Now when you see Mothmen,
are you talking...

402
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:03,613
Aliens, Angels, Mothmen,
call 'em whatever you like.

403
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,409
They live in the woods
and the caves off
the Lonely Highway.

404
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,497
Mr. Dreyfuss, I've lived
in Riverdale almost my
whole life.

405
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,834
Why have I never heard
of the Mothmen before?

406
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,962
There were some articles
back in the day. Ask around.

407
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,756
Some people remember.

408
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,132
Well, aren't you worried
that they're gonna come back

409
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,884
for you living out here
all by yourself?

410
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,385
[Dreyfuss] I'm not afraid.

411
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,803
I'm hopin'.

412
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,305
I'm hopin' they come back
for me.

413
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,432
I want to go up in their
ship like the others.

414
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,695
[engine whirring]

415
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,869
This is definitely
the place.

416
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,094
[Betty] Franview Freight Lines.

417
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,888
That's him in the blue rig.

418
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,474
-That's truckerboy69.
-What? Betty, are you sure?

419
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,486
[door opens]

420
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,615
You're not Patty.

421
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,284
No, I'm her sister
and I'm with the FBI.

422
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,285
You're coming with me.

423
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,127
I keep saying I didn't
do anything wrong.

424
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,588
You arranged to meet
my sister at that truck stop.

425
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,716
And that's the last time
anyone's seen her.

426
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:51,138
Look, I did meet Patty
three nights ago.

427
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,557
She'd scored some
Jingle-Jangle
and reached out.

428
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,934
-We met up at
the truck stop.
-And then what?

429
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,521
I told her that we should
take a drive
to clear her mind.

430
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:04,401
She was down with that plan,
but about a half a mile up
the highway, she freaked.

431
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,695
Jumped out of the truck,
started running.

432
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,738
I tried to get her back
in my cab, but she
wouldn't listen.

433
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,906
She just kept running.

434
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,869
That's the last time
I saw her.

435
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,329
Honest to God.

436
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,040
So you just left her there
on the side of the road.

437
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,043
I didn't have a choice.
Patty was scared.

438
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,379
I didn't want to make it worse.

439
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:28,258
What part of the highway?
I need you to be very specific.

440
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,641
Hey, honey. What's going on?

441
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,809
Why are you getting home
so late?

442
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,896
It's about Polly, mom.

443
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,647
I have a lead
I need your help with.

444
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,068
But you should sit down.

445
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,032
[bell ringing]

446
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,075
Look, I'm sorry, team.

447
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,369
The thing is, I should've got
my ducks in a row first

448
00:24:56,411 --> 00:25:00,665
-and secured the funding.
-And the school really can't
give us any money at all?

449
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:04,127
No. There's no funding
for sports, clubs, extra...

450
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,046
[music playing]

451
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,797
[cheering]

452
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,484
Toni, since when are
the Vixens back?

453
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,154
Since I made it a priority
in the budget last year?

454
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,198
There isn't even a sports thing
for them to cheer for.

455
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,116
Uh, get over yourself Archie.

456
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,662
The Vixens are a sports team,
and this year we're gonna be

457
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,914
competing against
other cheer squads.

458
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,415
I'm not even sure I'll manage
to do that.

459
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,136
Forget the school.

460
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,430
Isn't there anyone else
who could sponsor the Bulldogs?

461
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,194
It's Doris Bell.

462
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,156
You told me to keep you
apprised of goings on at
the school.

463
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:19,786
Well, there's something
I think you should know.

464
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,539
I see.

465
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,540
Thanks, Miss Bell.

466
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:32,007
So sorry for the interruption,
Miss Marble.

467
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:35,969
How are you finding that
portrait of my beloved brother?

468
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,931
I mean, figurative is back in
vogue, and the artist who
painted your brother

469
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,768
was chosen for next year's
Venice Biennale.

470
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,105
I believe this portrait
could easily fetch

471
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:51,735
-a quarter of a million dollars
at auction.
-And worth every penny.

472
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,323
I wonder...

473
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,450
might I get to keep
my JJ for

474
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:03,580
one more night so we can say
our proper ta-tas?

475
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,167
I understand. I'm staying at
the Five Seasons in town
overnight,

476
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,419
but I'll be around
first thing in the morning.

477
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:13,340
Even better, I'll have my men
pack it up and deliver it to
your hotel.

478
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,384
Well, Miss Blossom, it was a
pleasure dealing with you.

479
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,929
Should you decide to sell
any other items in your
collection, do let me know.

480
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,598
I will indeed, Miss Marble.

481
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:32,400
Now that she has authenticated
our original,

482
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:37,906
we can swap in your
perfect copy and Marble
shall be none the wiser.

483
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,203
What's the matter, child?

484
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:48,750
Oh, nothing. You know...
Just some upsetting news from
Riverdale High.

485
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,252
I'll be fine.

486
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,306
Betty.

487
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,349
Oh, my God.

488
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,143
[gasping]

489
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,107
These are her things.

490
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,485
These are Polly's things.

491
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,409
[Jughead] More coffee, champ?

492
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,744
Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jug.

493
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,663
How goes it with the Bulldogs?

494
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,832
It doesn't.

495
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,208
The kids don't have
any equipment.

496
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,168
They can't afford
any equipment.

497
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,963
And the school doesn't have
any money.

498
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,715
Well, if you promise to never
bring up

499
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,008
the epic highs and lows
of high school football again,

500
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,344
I can ask Tabitha
if she's willing to sponsor
the team.

501
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,346
That can't hurt.

502
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,098
There is one more person
I can ask.

503
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,936
Veronica.

504
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,188
But that would be weird, right?

505
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,400
I just interviewed a guy who
wants to be abducted by
Mothman aliens.

506
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,735
I think weird is relative.

507
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,988
I say go for it.

508
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,114
Embrace the weird.

509
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,243
What do you think,
Chad?

510
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,287
I know it's a tad sleazy
at the moment,

511
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,290
but it's the perfect spot
for a jewelry store.

512
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:13,877
Good foot traffic,
close to SoDale.

513
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:18,423
Only bad thing is it's not in
New York. But maybe that's
the whole point, huh?

514
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,720
Cards on the table, Chadwick.
Being back in Riverdale,

515
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,015
seeing my friends,
working on a new business,

516
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,185
it's been good for my soul.

517
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:35,565
So we would have a place in the
city and a place in Riverdale
where I'd be welcome?

518
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:41,362
Yes, but I need your support
on this Chad, and love.

519
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,406
You have it.

520
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,289
Just curious.

521
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,458
Are we going to buy a new house
or stay at the Pembrooke?

522
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,543
Bite your tongue.

523
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:59,255
I'm never leaving
that apartment, but it could do
with a remodel.

524
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,928
It's time for a change,
starting with a clean slate.

525
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:11,017
What happened to her Betty?
What happened to Polly out on
that highway?

526
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,144
I don't know, Mom.

527
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,731
But I do know one thing,

528
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,400
if that creepy guy in jail had
hurt Polly,

529
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,986
he wouldn't have told us
exactly where to go.

530
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,446
So we have nothing.
We have no leads.

531
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,532
We have...
She could be anywhere.

532
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,201
We didn't find Polly's
cell phone,

533
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,162
so we can trace it
through the phone company.

534
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,207
Or if they can't do it,
maybe the FBI can.

535
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,500
[sobbing] And if not?

536
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,383
We wait...

537
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,304
and we hope.

538
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,689
[Chadwick] So I need to be
back in the city
on Monday, the 19th.

539
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,191
That's fine. We have your
niece's birthday party
that weekend.

540
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:04,696
So Mondays through Thursdays,
I'm in the city, then here
every other weekend.

541
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,948
And I'll be in New York
every other weekend.

542
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,453
[chuckles]

543
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:15,707
You know, there is one other
option that your father,
of all people,

544
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:19,377
suggested. Um, I could move
to Riverdale full time

545
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,379
and help him manage the
SoDale properties.

546
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,051
You're in finance,
not real estate.

547
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,388
And wait, have you and
my father been talking
behind my back?

548
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,598
[knock on door]

549
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,896
-Archie.
-Hey, Veronica.

550
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,273
-Sorry to come by unannounced.
-Don't be. Come in.

551
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,861
Archie, this is unexpected.

552
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,863
Chad. Hey, you're still here.

553
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:55,204
Um, listen, the thing is,
I'm restarting

554
00:31:55,246 --> 00:32:01,210
the football team at
Riverdale High, and there's no
budget for anything.

555
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,338
Say no more.

556
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:06,299
As a former Vixen, I made an
oath to always support my
beloved Bulldogs.

557
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,051
I will absolutely cover
the startup costs.

558
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,761
Thank you, Veronica.

559
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,055
And I promise I'll pay you back
one hundred percent.

560
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,599
You mean, pay us back
one hundred percent.

561
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,810
Of course.

562
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,937
Pay you guys back.

563
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,773
Thank you, Chad.

564
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,484
You know, actually,
now I think about it.

565
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,863
You're a vet, a proud guy.

566
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,199
You don't want to be taking
handouts, do you?

567
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,825
So how's this for an idea?

568
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,036
Instead of us loaning you
the money,

569
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,205
what if you renovate
our apartment?

570
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,749
-This apartment.
-Babe, what are you
talking about?

571
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,086
We help out Archie's team,
he does this job for us and
gets paid.

572
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,047
I'm sure Archie has
a million other things,

573
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,548
-he's got to be doing
right now.
-[Archie] No, it's fine.

574
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,886
I definitely don't want
to be taking handouts.

575
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,597
I'll call some of my dad's
old crew and see if any of them
can help out.

576
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,017
Awesome-sauce.

577
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,436
-Thanks again, Ronnie.
-Of course. I'll see you at
school tomorrow.

578
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,570
Okay. What the hell was that?

579
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,031
He's my friend.

580
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,659
A guy like that, I'm sure he'd
rather do a little work than
crawl to you for charity.

581
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,494
You didn't have to be
such a dick about it.

582
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,663
Excuse me?

583
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,249
Have I not been accommodating
to your every whim since
I've been here?

584
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,584
I've been nice to your friends.
I even sang karaoke.

585
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,878
I didn't realize
those were such chores for you.

586
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,676
They weren't.

587
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:36,347
I wanted to do them for you.
If I came across dickish
with Archie,

588
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:40,810
um, I'm sorry, but it won't
happen again, okay?

589
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,605
-Okay.
-Good.

590
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,775
What's for dinner?

591
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,447
-Can we get Pop's take out?
-Ugh, I don't think
I can handle

592
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,115
another greasy burger and
onion rings.

593
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,077
Let's go out.

594
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,955
There's this Italian place
that your dad mentioned.
Mia's?

595
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,715
Sure. Let's go to Mia's.

596
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,058
Are you working on your
Mothmen chronicles?

597
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,226
It is so bizarre, Tabitha.

598
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,437
So I ended up
talking to old man Dreyfus,

599
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,439
and he did tell me the names of
the people that he used to
work with.

600
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,649
All his buddies from back in
the day.

601
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:33,488
-Tracked them down just so I
could corroborate his story.
-Uh-huh?

602
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,073
Get this.

603
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,492
They're all dead.

604
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,080
Couldn't that just be
a coincidence because
they're old?

605
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,624
Well, curiously,
they all died from cancer.

606
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:49,879
And, yeah, that could be a
coincidence, but maybe,
just maybe,

607
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,468
they were all exposed to the
same radiation on
the spaceship. Hm?

608
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,387
Uh, is that what happens when
you go aboard a spaceship?

609
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,306
Oh, I have no idea.
But it makes a great story.

610
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,976
What's the next step?

611
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,938
Dreyfus said that some articles
were produced after their
close encounter,

612
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,107
so just tracking those
ones down.

613
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,070
I'm in.

614
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:20,118
If you want some help,
unless you're like
the lone wolf type or whatever.

615
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,246
Sure.

616
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,000
More the merrier.

617
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,840
[knock on door]

618
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,386
-Betty.
-Hey.

619
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,888
-Is Chuck at home?
-No, he's working.

620
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,685
My mom and I are waiting
to hear something.

621
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:51,440
Anything about Polly and she's
driving me crazy.

622
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:55,361
Yeah. I'm feeling pretty crazy
and frustrated myself.

623
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,501
Let's go upstairs.

624
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,386
[sighs]

625
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,140
[cell phone ringing]

626
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,184
-Is that me?
-It's me, I think.

627
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,108
Yeah, it's my friend, Todd
from the academy.

628
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,860
It's probably about
Polly's phone.

629
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:42,241
I should go, but this...
was really nice.

630
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,388
-What's this?
-Chad.

631
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,143
Upon reflection, I think
we need to pump the brakes.

632
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,275
Back in New York,
I had the instinct

633
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:20,238
that we should take some time
to be by ourselves.

634
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,659
And as fun as the last few days
have been,

635
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,246
-I still think we need a break.
-Because of Archie?

636
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:32,792
No, Chad. Because of me.

637
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,336
Because I need real time and
space to figure out

638
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:41,259
if I'm a Pop's girl or
a Mia's girl or both.

639
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,305
It's not gonna be a problem,
is it?

640
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,309
Not at all.

641
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,311
Just let me know
when you're ready to talk.

642
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:06,993
Cheryl.

643
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,662
Hi, Toni.

644
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,624
I was going to give you a call
and then I thought, mmm no.

645
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,252
Stealing my Vixens warrants
a visit in person.

646
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,676
You're playing
a very dangerous game, Topaz.

647
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,056
All right. You've each been
assigned a locker.

648
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:33,227
That's to go along with your
new cleats, your new uniform
and pads.

649
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,896
I'm also psyched to announce
our generous sponsor

650
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:39,567
for all this stuff
and other Bulldog expenses
is Veronica Gekko.

651
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,986
Lodge, actually.
Veronica Lodge.

652
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,824
Okay. Well, you heard the lady.

653
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,326
Let's give Veronica Lodge
a round of applause.

654
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,745
[all applauding]

655
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:58,127
You asked me to call if
anything interesting or
important happens.

656
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:03,007
Well, you should know what's
going on in the boys
locker room right now.

657
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:05,885
I see.

658
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,347
Well, thank you, Miss Bell.

659
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:13,017
Your information is, as always,
very much appreciated.

660
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:13,976
We'll be in touch.

661
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:20,900
You see, now I'm angry.

662
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,569
-What happened?
-Archie Andrews made good

663
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,988
on his promise to you
and started a football team...

664
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,658
with my daughter's money.

665
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:36,665
So maybe this time,
we pay him a visit.

666
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,876
I heard from my friend
Todd at the FBI.

667
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,296
He traced the call to
somewhere in this region.

668
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,507
Swedlow Swamp?

669
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,259
I don't understand.
What was Polly doing there?

670
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:51,389
And how on earth are we going
to find her? That's acres and
acres of marsh land.

671
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,183
We'll just have to keep calling
her cell phone until we
hear it ring.

672
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,646
[Kevin] Assuming it's
still charged.

673
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,576
We've been out here for hours.
We're freezing.

674
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,828
-Maybe we should pick it up--
-Shh.

675
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,830
I hear something.

676
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:19,875
Let's split up.

677
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,429
Guys, guys over here.

678
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,107
[Jughead] Archie,
there's a fire!
