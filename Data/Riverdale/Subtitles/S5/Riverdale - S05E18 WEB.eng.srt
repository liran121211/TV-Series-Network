1
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,178
Here you go, Betty.

2
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,764
- These are on the house.
- Thank you, Fangs.

3
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,059
Thank you guys for rallying.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,144
Of course.

5
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,313
How are you holding up, Bee?

6
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,192
As good as I can be, I guess.

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,569
How are the twins?

8
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,240
They're okay, surprisingly.

9
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:36,995
Cheryl volunteered
to take them for a few days.

10
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,080
They have been asking
about their mom though.

11
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,126
And I told them
that she's somewhere beautiful

12
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,461
and close by.

13
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,422
We hung up a hummingbird feeder
in the rose garden,

14
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,549
and they wait for their mommy to visit it.

15
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,759
Beautiful, Cheryl.

16
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,806
- How's your mom?
- She's not good, Jug.

17
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,892
She won't leave the house.

18
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:03,188
She's listening
to this Next to Normal cast album

19
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,647
on repeat.

20
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,982
What's Next to Normal?

21
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:10,070
It's a Broadway musical
that she took Polly and I to see...

22
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:15,033
one year for Mother's Day in the city.

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,910
What's it about?

24
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,119
This family.

25
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,290
To be honest, watching it,

26
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,293
it felt like it could have been...

27
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,546
about us.

28
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,510
The mom, she wants this normal...

29
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,013
perfect family.

30
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,016
But she's lying to herself.

31
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,187
She and her husband don't love
each other anymore.

32
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,857
She fights with her daughter a lot.

33
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:52,570
And one of her kids is... dead.

34
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:57,283
- Jeez, Betty.
- It's actually a really beautiful show.

35
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,205
And we had the best day.

36
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,584
Just the three of us
walking around New York.

37
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,673
So your mom is just listening
to this album?

38
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,341
Over and over again.

39
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,681
I don't even know
what she's thinking or feeling.

40
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,352
Mom.

41
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,189
- The record was skipping.
- I, uh...

42
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,693
I'm just tired. That's all.
I'm gonna go take a nap.

43
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,530
Okay. I'm gonna clean up down here.

44
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,620
Poor Betty and Alice. It's heartbreaking.

45
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,703
Yeah.

46
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,666
What can we do for them?

47
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,629
I think we're just on standby
for whatever they need.

48
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,885
In the meantime,
Archie, I've been thinking.

49
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,265
Those seven years
we lost after graduation...

50
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,394
- I don't wanna lose any more.
- Yeah, me neither.

51
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:35,441
So, what do you think
about us moving in together?

52
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,070
Wow, seriously?

53
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,489
I think it's an amazing idea.

54
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,742
I'm surprised you're okay
with living with roommates.

55
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,871
Oh, I just assumed
we'd live here at The Pembrooke.

56
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,874
My house has a little more room.
We'd be able to grow into it.

57
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,006
All right, yeah.
Let's give it a go, lover.

58
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,594
Waldo, what's going on?

59
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,849
We have a bit of a situation
with one of our students, Britta Beach.

60
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,309
Oh, no, is she okay?

61
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,476
Oh, she's fine.

62
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,813
But our janitor, Mr. Poppins,
found her in a closet under the stairwell.

63
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,192
- She's been living there.
- Well, sadly, I can guess why.

64
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,237
- Where is she now?
- In the cafeteria, getting hot breakfast.

65
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,948
- Can you help?
- Of course.

66
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,575
And I know who to call.

67
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,785
Britta, this is a friend, Miss Weiss.

68
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,163
She's a social worker like me.

69
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,124
You wanna tell us what's been going on?

70
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,132
My parents basically kicked me out.

71
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,846
They blamed me getting kidnapped
by those crazy brothers

72
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,973
on my deviant gay lifestyle.

73
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,769
Britta, there's nothing deviant
about you or your identity.

74
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,396
Matter of fact, you're perfect.

75
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,981
And we support you.

76
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,108
I have a full house of foster kids,

77
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,819
and I'm happy
to offer you a place to sleep,

78
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,323
anything else you might need,
at least for a few nights.

79
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:09,327
It'll give me more time to find you
a permanent, safe and loving home.

80
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,412
Thank you, Miss Topaz.

81
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:21,214
Hey, Mom. I'm gonna go for a hike.
Do you wanna come with me?

82
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,715
I don't think so, honey.

83
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,759
Mom.

84
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:31,641
I know you're grieving,
but you need to find a way to move on.

85
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,769
Do you remember our ski trip
to the Catskill Mountains?

86
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,481
You and Polly didn't wanna
come off the bunny hill.

87
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,900
I know you miss Polly, Mom.

88
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,445
We both do.

89
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,575
It's not... just that. It's...

90
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,881
Those are all of the kitchen updates
I've made since I took over.

91
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,012
Anyway, uh, Mom and Dad,

92
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,015
I thought it would be nice for us
to have dinner at Pop's tomorrow night.

93
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,642
For Mother's Day?

94
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:24,272
No, darling, we made reservations
at a nice Italian restaurant.

95
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,607
Um... Cucina Sacasa.

96
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:30,236
You really don't want to eat at Pop's
while you're here?

97
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,446
Dad, you practically grew up
in this place.

98
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,575
- And I couldn't get away fast enough.
- Okay.

99
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,744
Cucina Sacasa sounds perfect.

100
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,081
Jones, does that work for you?

101
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,334
Yeah, sure. That sounds great.

102
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,168
Great.

103
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,549
And, uh, why would your busboy come
to dinner with us?

104
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,218
Oh, because he's also my boyfriend, Dad.

105
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:04,312
So, uh... your parents are
pretty intense, huh?

106
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,230
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

107
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,691
And I'm your boyfriend now?

108
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,486
It would be great
to have a buffer at dinner.

109
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,571
Will you do it?

110
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,698
Pretend to be your boyfriend? Yeah, sure.

111
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,576
You know, if you want, you could...

112
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,454
You could just ask me
to be your real boyfriend.

113
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:25,291
Jughead, as you know,
that is an intriguing possibility to me,

114
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,627
but your timing couldn't be less perfect.

115
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,881
Riverdale and the rest of the world
are in a perpetual state of crisis.

116
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,800
There's no such thing as perfect timing.

117
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,645
Unbelievable.

118
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,944
Mom, where did the piano come from?

119
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,615
I ordered it on Glamazon.

120
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,744
Remember when I gave you girls lessons?
You loved them so much.

121
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,875
Oh, Mom, Archie and Veronica
invited us over for dinner tonight.

122
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,628
What if we went? It's just next door.

123
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,421
No, I'm cooking tonight.

124
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,340
Polly's favorite. Meatloaf.

125
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,841
For all of us. Will you join?

126
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,847
Sure. I just have
to go pick something up first.

127
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,734
Wow, Ronnie, this looks amazing.

128
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,569
It's chicken cordon bleu.

129
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,533
Remember, boys, when Ina Garten tells you
to keep your rolls tight, you listen.

130
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,623
Ina Garten, the Barefoot Contessa?

131
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,090
- Fire off Main.
- I'll grab the keys.

132
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,884
- I'm so sorry, babe.
- No apologies, Superstud.

133
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,845
- Duty calls, city needs you.
- We'll nuke it up when we get back.

134
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,180
Don't wait up, okay?

135
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,847
Sir, yes, sir.

136
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,065
- I'll eat in the garage.
- Sounds good.

137
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,641
Mom, what is this?

138
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,309
Oh, Betty, perfect timing.

139
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,813
I know I went a little overboard,
but isn't this so nice?

140
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,898
All of us together around one table again?

141
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,316
Mom, stop.

142
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,610
You are freaking me out.

143
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,614
Tell me, is your plan to just never leave
the house ever again?

144
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,032
Why would I?

145
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,326
I have everything I need right here.

146
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,036
All of my children.

147
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,998
Mom.

148
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,421
You know Charles
and Polly aren't really here, right?

149
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,182
- What's that?
- Polly's ashes.

150
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:02,062
I thought having them
might bring you comfort or closure.

151
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,400
That can't be right.
I'm sitting right here.

152
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,485
Tell Betty to stop being such a brat.

153
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,353
Hey.

154
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,523
I have an idea.

155
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,360
Why don't you and I go into the city?

156
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,321
See a Broadway show?

157
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,490
That'd be really good for you.

158
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,784
For both of us.

159
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,746
- Yeah, I'd like that.
- Okay.

160
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,249
Thank you, honey.

161
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,109
Didn't hear you come in last night,
Mr. Inferno.

162
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,902
Oh, my God, redacted.

163
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,946
Hey, Jug, pass me a loofah.

164
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,200
- Um, where's Archie?
- He slept at the station,

165
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,411
so the guys could go home
and take a power nap, clean up.

166
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,871
Guy's a prince, right?

167
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,966
So they all left you.

168
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,634
All your congregants.

169
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,178
It was bound to happen.

170
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,097
Forget your cruelty, Mother. I'm praying.

171
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,058
Yes, to your false gods.

172
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,438
You said my ministry was a scam
and that yours was genuine,

173
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:14,903
when, really, it was the pathetic attempt
of a narcissist to prop herself up.

174
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:15,988
Enough!

175
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,615
My ministry is real.

176
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,492
My God is Gaia.

177
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:25,122
And now I see plainly,
my devil, Mother, is you.

178
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,356
An exorcism, nightmare child? That's rich.

179
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,052
Toodle-oo.

180
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,265
Hey, by the way,
thanks for helping me cram

181
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,142
for the Series 7 exam, Ronnie.

182
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,478
You must think
it's nuts that I wanna pursue

183
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,189
- being a licensed stockbroker.
- Not at all.

184
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,860
Trust me, if anyone understands
the thrill of Wall Street, it's me.

185
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,028
Or it was.

186
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,242
Okay, next question:
"A broker who lives in Greenwich

187
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,744
decides to work
from her Miami pied-à-terre.

188
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,288
How long can she do so
without violating regional law?"

189
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:52,501
Thirty days. Then she must report back
to her original branch office.

190
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,588
Boom, Mantle the Magnificent for the win.

191
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,007
I'm telling you, Ronnie,

192
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,594
in five years,
I'm gonna have the swankiest penthouse

193
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:06,056
in New York City
and a killer job on the stock exchange.

194
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,100
How does that sound?

195
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,437
Sounds like heaven, Reggie.

196
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:22,197
Our Smardi's reservation is at 6:30,
our Moulin Rouge tickets are at will call,

197
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,366
I have our Tramtrack confirmation,

198
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,994
and I splurged
and got us two business class seats.

199
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,412
Why only two?

200
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,165
What? Mom, are you okay?

201
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,917
You're leaving me behind?

202
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,837
No, honey, let me explain.

203
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,839
Mom, no, don't go there.

204
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,425
Whatever this is,
okay, it's just memories.

205
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,271
Mom, please, let's just go.

206
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,989
It's not real.

207
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:08,327
It's just your guilt or grief.

208
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,858
They don't exist.

209
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,109
But I do.

210
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,258
- No, I need them and they need me.
- I need you.

211
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,701
You weren't here.

212
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,372
I begged you to stay and you left.

213
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,708
For seven years, you were gone.

214
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,586
And when you did finally come back...

215
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,672
all of this started with Polly.

216
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,841
You drove her away.

217
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,759
She died.

218
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,597
She's dead because of you.

219
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,744
Jughead Jones.

220
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,539
Join me a second?

221
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,553
Jughead, you seem
like a nice enough fellow,

222
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:17,390
so you should know
my daughter's going through a phase.

223
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,936
Whatever this is between you,
it's a passing fancy.

224
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:26,441
Well, I can assure you, sir,
I really like your daughter.

225
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,527
And I'm pretty sure
she feels the same way.

226
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,613
Son,

227
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,573
man to man,

228
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,159
she's out of your league.

229
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:40,538
I'm not trying to belittle you,
I'm simply being realistic. My advice?

230
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:45,794
Do all of us a favor and don't show up
to that Mother's Day dinner.

231
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,963
You remind me of Hiram Lodge.

232
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,589
I don't know who that is.

233
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,926
But, please,
have a Swellegrino for the road.

234
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,908
Sorry I missed dinner again.
It's like the entire town's on fire.

235
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,119
Actually, Archie...

236
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,580
can we check in?

237
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,584
About us and where we're going?

238
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,924
- This sounds serious.
- I just wanna know...

239
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,512
I just want to know where you see us...

240
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,182
and yourself, in the next five years.

241
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:50,108
You know I would never do anything
to hold you back, from any opportunity.

242
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,903
But in my...

243
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,490
heart of hearts,

244
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,246
in five years, I see myself in Riverdale.

245
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,042
Is that a deal breaker?

246
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,381
Of course not, Archiekins.

247
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:16,968
I just...

248
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,180
I think it's important for us...

249
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,850
to have these honest conversations.

250
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,675
Toni, you've been going at it all night.
You want to take a break for lasagne?

251
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,135
I can't, Fangs.

252
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,971
I've spent all day
trying to find a place for Britta to live.

253
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:06,518
I tried group homes,
youth shelters, other social workers.

254
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,102
No one will take her.

255
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:14,526
You know, this might be a terrible idea,

256
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,112
but there is one more person
you could ask.

257
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,741
Someone with a newfound penchant
for helping people.

258
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,535
No. No way.

259
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,871
Why not? Cheryl really has changed.

260
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,749
And any port in a storm.

261
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,792
Right?

262
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,768
Hey, Betty. What's going on?

263
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,188
- I could've come to your house.
- No, Kev.

264
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:57,235
Home is bad and getting worse.

265
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,989
I'm just petrified for my mom.

266
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,950
She's in this cocoon

267
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:08,371
where Polly and her normal,
perfect family are thriving.

268
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,249
I'm just lost.

269
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,168
We both are.

270
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,151
Maybe my mom was right.

271
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,823
And it's my fault Polly's dead.

272
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,115
Betty, it's not.

273
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,452
And you still have a choice.

274
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,597
Sometimes when we're in free fall...

275
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,518
...we test our loved ones' love.

276
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,563
We push people away.

277
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,274
Hold on tighter.

278
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:24,257
Make the commitment to your mother.
Go back, pick up the pieces.

279
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,009
Catch each other.

280
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,437
What's keeping
your boyfriend, Tabitha?

281
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,647
Too much ketchup
to scrape off the countertops.

282
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,400
Guys, please stop being mean
about Jughead.

283
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,653
If you're still upset
that I left Chicago for Riverdale

284
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,406
to run our family business, Dad,
then just say so.

285
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:52,118
You had a wonderful career.
You could have worked with me.

286
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:00,168
Hold that thought, Dad.
My date just showed up.

287
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,876
Tee-Tee for tea time.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

288
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:10,131
I have a favor to ask, Cheryl.
There is this girl that needs a home.

289
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,798
Britta Beach.

290
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,177
Her story's similar to yours.

291
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,804
Didn't go so well with her family
when she came out.

292
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:23,352
So I thought, if you had the space,
maybe you could offer her a place to stay?

293
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,522
Poor cherub.

294
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:32,153
But I must admit, I'm surprised
you'd trust me with such precious cargo.

295
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,489
I loved you.

296
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,867
And I felt your love.

297
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,914
And I know the huge capacity for love
your heart has.

298
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,209
It's exactly what Britta needs.

299
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,422
Well, then I'd be honored.

300
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,967
Archie, can we talk?

301
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,636
Okay.

302
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,474
In my marriage with Chad...

303
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,228
I felt like I was muted.

304
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,896
Like I was fading.

305
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,984
And it happened so slowly,
I didn't even notice it at first.

306
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:17,573
And the thing is,
I'm starting to feel that way again here.

307
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,660
Like I'm not myself.

308
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,121
Like I'm losing myself.

309
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,205
I am sorry. I...

310
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,707
I had no idea.

311
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,876
Archie, I think...

312
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,088
I think...

313
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:37,885
we should take a beat
until we figure out what we're doing.

314
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,346
We shouldn't rush this.

315
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,976
Or maybe we just go back to dating
and having fun like we used to.

316
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,521
That's a sweet idea.

317
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,317
But we're not in high school anymore.

318
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,585
Betty.

319
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,674
- What are you doing here?
- I took the record player out.

320
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,178
You won't need it anymore.

321
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,721
Years ago,

322
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,684
I made you a promise
that I would come back to Riverdale,

323
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,312
which I broke.

324
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,566
But right now I'm making you a new one.

325
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,819
I'm not leaving you alone.

326
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,945
Ever.

327
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,787
I love you so much, Mom.

328
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,705
I'm here.

329
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,377
I'm so sorry.

330
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,840
I didn't mean
that horrible thing I said to you,

331
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,218
that Polly was your fault.

332
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:44,886
It's okay, Mom.

333
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,395
The irony is...

334
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:22,068
all I ever wanted was for us
to be a normal family.

335
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,287
I'm glad they decided
to do a memorial and bury the ashes.

336
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,875
It was really beautiful,
everyone coming together like that.

337
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:24,672
As the bard once said,
"We cannot hold mortality's strong hand."

338
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:30,302
But we can hold each other's.
Remember what's really important.

339
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,934
Seemed like Britta
and Cheryl were getting along well.

340
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,520
She's already got Britta in a cape.

341
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,482
You did a really good thing, Toni.
For both of them.

342
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,070
Fangs...

343
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,119
I think I love you.

344
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,373
If I'm being honest...

345
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,921
I think I love you too, Toni.
