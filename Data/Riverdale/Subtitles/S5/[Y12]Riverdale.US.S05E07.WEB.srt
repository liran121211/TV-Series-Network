1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,712
[Jughead]
Portrait of a town in flames,

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:07,924
thanks to a fire extinguisher
Mr. Andrews kept stored
in the hall closet,

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:11,344
and another one
under the kitchen sink.

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,681
What could have been
a suburban inferno
was instead

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,808
nearly the latest indication
of how far

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,478
the now non-existent
town of Riverdale had fallen.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,272
An arsonist on the loose

8
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,274
and no firemen
to battle the fires.

9
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,317
Archie...

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,113
You see this guy
in the front?

11
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,115
That is my Grandpa Ardy.

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,908
He was a fireman
back in the day.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,744
Oh, geez.
I know where this is going.

14
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,204
The best counterattack
is not to fight fire with fire

15
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,331
but to fight fire
with a fire department.

16
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,876
What, no mano-a -mano
with Hiram Lodge?

17
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,544
I called Ronnie.
She's gonna talk to him.

18
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,130
Oh, Ronnie is.
That's interesting.

19
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,882
[Archie] You see this rookie?

20
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,675
He ended up becoming
Riverdale's fire chief
for 20 years.

21
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,136
He's retired now
but he still lives
in Riverdale.

22
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,389
Well, go get 'em, soldier.

23
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,142
[Betty] I'm hoping we already
know the answer, Dr. Curdle Jr,

24
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,643
but...

25
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,897
Is this my sister's body?

26
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,357
Your sister's been missing
for a week.

27
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,402
These remains have been
in Swedlow Swamp

28
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,571
for approximately three years.

29
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,782
The bog preserved her.

30
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,034
Well, do you have
a cause of death yet?

31
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,702
At first blush,

32
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,412
blunt force trauma
to the head.

33
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,624
What happens to the body now,
to her?

34
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,250
[Dr. Curdle Jr.]
Without identification,

35
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,461
she'll be sent
to the crematorium
for disposal.

36
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,339
Dr. Curdle,
will you just wait a beat

37
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,965
while I do some digging
for her identity?

38
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,551
-Of course.
-Right. I'm going back
to Swedlow Swamp.

39
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,720
Polly, or at least her phone
is still out there.

40
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,725
Daddy, someone set fire
to Archie's house last night

41
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,811
and this attack
has your fingerprints
all over it.

42
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,897
Now, why would I want
to burn down
the Andrews' family home?

43
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,816
The rash of arson cases
around town

44
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:51,611
is meant to drive
any remaining long-term
residents away,

45
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,614
so you're precious SoDale
becomes the only
game in town.

46
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,366
Am I getting warm, Daddy?

47
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,576
Riverdale can't be saved.

48
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,537
Your high school is a joke.

49
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,539
Heck, you haven't had
garbage pickups in months.

50
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,457
The place smells
like a corpse.

51
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,792
It's not coming back to life.

52
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,044
We'll see about that, Daddy.

53
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,754
This just became personal.

54
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,344
Wow.

55
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,720
Was I ever that young?

56
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,472
Feels like a lifetime ago.

57
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,474
It doesn't
have to be, Chief Russell.

58
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,685
You could come out
of retirement.

59
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,645
This town
needs a fire department.

60
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,231
Hiram Lodge didn't just
shut down the department.

61
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,233
He firebombed the fire house.

62
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,277
Then we'll operate
out of my gym.

63
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,904
And I'll be the first volunteer
following in
my Grandpa Ardy's footsteps.

64
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,907
It was an honor working
with your Grandpa, Archie.

65
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,160
But this is
a young man's battle.

66
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,544
[bell chimes]

67
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,423
[upbeat music playing]

68
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,179
[door opens]

69
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,764
[record scratches]

70
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,815
Well, well,
well, if it isn't
Miss. Winchester herself.

71
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,817
You come for another
surprise visit, Cheryl?

72
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,904
Thank you for taking care
of the River Vixens
whilst I was self-isolating.

73
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,198
But, as Elton John
likes to say,

74
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,701
"The bitch is back in town"
and the squad
is my birthright.

75
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,870
Wrong. The Vixens
are mine now, hon.

76
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,332
I restarted them,
I'm financing them,

77
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,500
and we've been doing
all the work.

78
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,377
So what are you gonna do
about that?

79
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,505
What every Vixen throughout
history has done
to settle a dispute...

80
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,882
Challenge you to a dance off.

81
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,551
-I'm pregnant.
-Does that mean you forfeit?

82
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,511
I'll dance for Ms. Topaz

83
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,971
as her proxy.

84
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,976
You know, I usually have a rule
about annihilating
high school students

85
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,396
but you seem
particularly insufferable.

86
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,483
[hip-hop music playing]

87
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,206
[music stops]

88
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,624
[blows air]

89
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,128
[sighs wearily]

90
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,171
Now let's decide this.

91
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,215
All those in favor of moi

92
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,341
as your HPIC.

93
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,552
[whooping]

94
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,431
And all those for me?

95
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,017
[all cheering]

96
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,062
A tie. In that case,

97
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,648
I'd be willing to share control
of the Vixens,

98
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,650
if your ego
could handle that.

99
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,902
Agreed...for now.

100
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,658
Why are you buffoons
just standing there?
Take it from the top.

101
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,035
[snaps finger]

102
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,750
Well, I spoke with my father
and of course, he denies

103
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,003
having anything to do
with setting
your porch on fire, Archie.

104
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,504
Figures.

105
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,341
And I spoke
to the old fire chief

106
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,343
and he won't help.

107
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,179
So, now I have no fire engine,

108
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,931
no volunteers
and no one to train them.

109
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,727
I could maybe help with that.

110
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,188
My best friend Katy Keene's
roommate Jorge,

111
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,358
his ex-boyfriend is an actual
New York firefighter.

112
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,360
Let me see if I can
get him out here
for a day or two.

113
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,320
Ronnie, that would be amazing.
Thank you.

114
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,782
In the meantime,
after my tete-a-tete
with dear old Daddy,

115
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,242
I came up with a crazy idea

116
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,578
to bolster Riverdale's
struggling economy.

117
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,583
Listen up, guys. This week
you're going to learn
how to revive a dying economy.

118
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,752
Namely, ours.

119
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,754
Step one, create jobs.

120
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:24,133
Who wants to renovate
a CD-video store and turn it
into a jewelry shop

121
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,260
and to be exempt
from the mid-term exam?

122
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,728
Tabitha, check this out.

123
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,355
I spent the afternoon
at the library.

124
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,108
Found an article
about Old Man Dreyfuss
in the script.

125
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,819
"Four of the five minors
detailed an encounter

126
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,487
with a frightening
humanoid creature

127
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,322
they described as a Mothman."

128
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,033
-Well, he wasn't lying.
-Or he was lying to you now

129
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,785
and they were lying back then.

130
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,246
Except, I kept looking
for more articles
and I found that one

131
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,915
written two months
after the Mothman one.

132
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,834
"A group of residents
in the town of Riverdale

133
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,419
were stunned late last month

134
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,754
as they watched
a mysterious sight unfold."

135
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,925
Unexplained lights
materializing,
hovering in the dark sky."

136
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,679
Read the last paragraph.
Do you see who's quoted
as an eye witness?

137
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,851
No way.

138
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,771
Think you can
get me an interview?

139
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,820
Hey, Sarge, nice digs.

140
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,947
[gasps] Jackson.

141
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,699
When did you get released
from the hospital?

142
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,659
A couple of days ago.

143
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,454
I signed up for the program
the VA was offering,
the therapeutic housing.

144
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,373
-Why? You don't need that,
do you?
-[chuckles]

145
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,959
Some of us need help
transitioning to civilian life.

146
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,003
-Yes.
-I'm sorry.
No. I'm happy for you.

147
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,963
Figured I'd take you up
on your invitation before I go.

148
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,590
Well, your timing's perfect.

149
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,675
I'm just about to go to the bar
to meet some friends.

150
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,011
Why don't you come inside?
Drop your stuff off
and then we'll go?

151
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,974
So I went through
all the archives

152
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,809
in the Sheriff's office,
Dr. Curdle,

153
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,811
and there was only one
missing person file
in the last seven years.

154
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,688
Margaret Harper.

155
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,691
I'm sorry, Ms. Cooper,
but Margaret Harper
isn't a match, either.

156
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,443
According
to this police report,

157
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,946
Margaret had braces
at the time
of her disappearance.

158
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,282
There's no evidence of braces
on our Jane Doe.

159
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,203
Okay...

160
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,289
So she's not Polly
or Margaret.
She's a third missing girl.

161
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,751
And three is a pattern.

162
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,057
Guys, this is Eric Jackson.

163
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,101
We served together.
I trust him with my life.

164
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,687
-Eric, these are the guys.
-Nice to meet you, fellas.

165
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,397
Jackson, thank you
for your service.

166
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,442
-My dad served as well.
-No greater honor.

167
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,861
So, I'm looking
for a few good men.

168
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,988
Story of my life.

169
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,865
I'm hoping to assemble
a volunteer fire department

170
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,867
to replace the one
Hiram Lodge disbanded.

171
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,703
Guys who aren't afraid
to run into a burning building
and save lives.

172
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,747
So...

173
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,415
Figured I'd start
with you guys.

174
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,709
We don't know
the first thing
about firefighting.

175
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,463
Except for what I learned
watching Backdraft
over and over in junior high.

176
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,925
That is why Veronica
is getting an expert
from New York.

177
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,970
It's going to be fun.
Trust me. So who's with me?

178
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,810
[sighs] Civilians.

179
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,647
[Betty] Thank you
for coming in, Ms. Harper.

180
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,941
I don't want to reopen
old wounds

181
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,861
but I was working
on another missing persons case

182
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,947
when I came across
your daughter's file.

183
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,159
Margaret was a bright girl.

184
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,995
But she fell in
with the wrong crowd.

185
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,914
-Were you and Margaret close?
-Not so much.

186
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,000
I think she

187
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,960
felt like
she couldn't talk to me

188
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,254
once she...

189
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,172
She started going
with the truckers.

190
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,595
Ms. Harper, what do you believe
happened to your daughter?

191
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,763
[sighs]

192
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,515
I have no idea.

193
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,602
Which in a way
makes it so much worse.

194
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,021
Yeah. I understand.

195
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,815
Sheriff Keller
did what he could.

196
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,942
But he was one man

197
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,153
and the whole town
was falling apart.

198
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,782
There was a social worker

199
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,868
named Toni.

200
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,536
She was a godsend.

201
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,380
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Cheryl Blossom.

202
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,007
I'd heard rumors
that Queen Elsa

203
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,133
had come down
from the mountain.

204
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,926
It was a Vixens emergency.

205
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,596
Well, how are your art skills
these days?

206
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,098
Flawless as ever. Why?

207
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,476
I want you to design something
for me,

208
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,395
something that would fit
on this printing plate.

209
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,149
[Eric] I was a cavalry scout,

210
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,444
before being
selected for sniper school.

211
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,029
By the time I graduated,

212
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,324
I could bullseye
a playing card at 500 meters.

213
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,077
Right, guys. Last question
for Corporal Jackson.

214
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,453
Ask him anything.

215
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,663
What was the Commander like
in the army?

216
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,790
[all snickering]

217
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,500
I'll show you.

218
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,966
I got this nifty hunk of metal

219
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,635
from a grenade
on the battlefield.

220
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,471
But if it weren't
for your commander,

221
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,640
I'd have been sent home
in a body bag.

222
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,351
Sergeant Andrews

223
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,854
is the kind of man
that never stops giving back.

224
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,439
Hell, that's why
he's trying to start

225
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,192
a volunteer fire department
on his own.

226
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,777
Wait. Can we help with that?

227
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,237
What, with the fire department?

228
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,864
No,
you got school and football.

229
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,908
With due respect,
so do you, sir.

230
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,119
Damn.

231
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,538
My own friends turned me down
and you guys are in?

232
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,997
[all] Yeah.

233
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,751
Okay, then.

234
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,629
But you have to be 16
to sign up and you need
your parent's permission.

235
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,049
[student] What's this,
Ms. Lodge?

236
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,135
Prototypes.

237
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,555
The real money
will be printed,
not photocopied.

238
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,099
So,

239
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:09,228
there was a town
in Oregon on the verge
of economic collapse,

240
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,731
much like
our beloved Riverdale.

241
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:15,109
Until they started
printing their own money.

242
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,071
Money they could use
as actual currency
but only in their town,

243
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,240
so it keeps getting
reinvested in the town.

244
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,325
-How does that work?
-Simple.

245
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,412
I pay you for remodeling
my jewelry shop
with River dollars

246
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,956
which you then funnel back
into Riverdale's economy

247
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,167
by spending it at Pop's
or the Bijou.

248
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,252
-And they'll accept it?
-Yes.

249
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,254
Which they can either
redeem with me,

250
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,090
or hopefully, use it to pay
their own employees

251
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,759
to keep the flow going.

252
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,262
I've already sold
one of my Glamerge eggs
for $50,000,

253
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,931
which will serve
as collateral
for the new currency.

254
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,600
It's an investment
I'm happy to make,

255
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,436
especially if it gets people
in the habit of spending more

256
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,522
and supporting
local businesses in Riverdale.

257
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,984
-Any questions?
-Yeah.

258
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,486
When do we get paid?

259
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,330
[Betty] Mom?

260
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,665
I found Polly's phone.

261
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,751
No sign of her,

262
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,503
but I found this in the swamp.

263
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,380
That means Swedlow Swamp
is exactly where
we should keep looking.

264
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,550
Betty Cooper.
What can I get you?

265
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,678
Toni, does the name
"Margaret Harper"
mean anything to you?

266
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,181
Yeah. She went missing
a few years ago.

267
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,975
Yeah. I've been looking
for Polly, as you know,

268
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,811
and I came across
Margaret's file.

269
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,606
And I talked to her mom
who said that
you really helped her.

270
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,398
I mean, I tried to.

271
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,902
The truth is,
there's a lot of Margarets
in Riverdale.

272
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,112
She's just one of the few
that went missing
and got reported.

273
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,656
Yeah.

274
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:47,117
I try to set them up
with jobs or a support group,

275
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,411
-but it's hard, you know.
-Of course.

276
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,332
Toni,

277
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,501
I found a body
in Swedlow Swamp.

278
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,045
-Oh, my God.
-It wasn't Polly.

279
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,673
It wasn't Margaret,

280
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,175
but my mom found
Polly's phone there.

281
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,054
Something really bad
is happening in that swamp

282
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,597
and we need your help
searching it.

283
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,183
All the Serpents
are at your disposal, Betty.

284
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,769
Thank you.

285
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,231
Thanks for coming
to meet with us, Pop.

286
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,108
No problem.

287
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,361
Any excuse to visit
the Chock'lit Shoppe
now that I'm retired.

288
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,115
So about that article
we called you for,

289
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,158
the one with the lights,

290
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,702
you were quoted on it
and I was wondering
if you remember what happened.

291
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,078
Clear as day.

292
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,747
It was one night
about 50 years ago.

293
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,792
-[rock music
playing on jukebox]
-It was late.

294
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,168
There were probably

295
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,046
five or six people
in the diner.

296
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,382
Here you go. And here you go.

297
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,551
Two World Famous
burger combos. Enjoy.

298
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,261
-[static buzzes]
-Then all of a sudden,

299
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,722
you could feel this...
I don't know,

300
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,098
electricity in the air.

301
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,349

[distinct whooshing]

307
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,899
We all walked out
to the parking lot
to take a look.

308
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,693
Then, a few minutes later,

309
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,529
lights were gone

310
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,200
and it was just a beautiful
autumn night.

311
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,453
That's incredible, Grandpa.

312
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,706
-What do you think it was?
-We all had theories.

313
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,209
Some said aliens.

314
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,295
But the most
credible explanation I heard

315
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,506
was that
it was military testing

316
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,967
from an army base
outside Riverdale.

317
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,135
Did it ever happen again?

318
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,388
-The lights?
-No.

319
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,348
But I'll tell you,

320
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,850
a part of me wished

321
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,936
the lights would come back.

322
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,107
I just got goosebumps.

323
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,484
You know who else
was here that night
you should talk to?

324
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,319
-Who?
-Who?

325
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,279
Cheryl's grandmother.

326
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,659
-Nana Blossom?
-Yeah.

327
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,337
Welcome to day one
of Riverdale's volunteer
fire academy.

328
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,755
Today's
your first day of training

329
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,674
with a real firefighter
from New York City

330
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,551
who's gonna help
get us into shape.

331
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,679
Bernardo Brigsby
from Engine 141,
the floor is yours.

332
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,305
Thanks, Archie.

333
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,849
So show of hands,
how many of you

334
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,600
have had prior experience
fighting fires?

335
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,400
That's okay. We're gonna
start with the most
important lesson.

336
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,486
You must work as a team.

337
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,031
No one goes
into a burning building alone.

338
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,701
A team is only as strong
as its weakest link.

339
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,119
And in my crew,

340
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,788
there are no weak links.

Why is Veronica printing
Monopoly money
with her face on it?

344
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,294
Relax. You will still
get your normal pay check.

345
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,589
This is Mad Money
to spend in Riverdale,

346
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,051
like here
or at the Bijou, or...

347
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,970
-[bell dings]
-Whiskey.

348
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,348
You better make that a double.

349
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,105
[blows whistle]

350
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,316
I've seen a porcelain doll
possessed by
my deceased brother

351
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,110
move faster than you lot.

352
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,529
What the hell is this, Cheryl?

353
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,448
Vixen's practice, obvi.

354
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,951
We need to be doing two days
if you want to avoid
public embarrassment.

355
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,953
We're supposed to be
coaching together.

356
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,871
But clearly,
you went behind my back
and scheduled a practice.

357
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,082
Well, I knew
you'd cause a scene
like this, Toni.

358
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,416
Duh.

359
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,669
Vixens, call Nurse Nightingale.

360
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,546
Cheryl, this ends now.

361
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,631
Vixens, like Blossoms,

362
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,383
are forged in fire.

363
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,635
Hmm. Wow.
That sounds like something
your mother would say.

364
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,013
Careful where
thoust treads, Toni.

365
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,515
You're on thin ice.

366
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,612
[engine revving]

367
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,406
[tires screeching]

368
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,784
That's far enough.

369
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,120
Every one of you is trespassing
on private property.

370
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,706
Retreat immediately
or face the consequences.

371
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,166
Hiram,

372
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,834
my daughter's missing.

373
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,627
She might be somewhere
in your swamp.

374
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,921
Alice, as a father,
I feel your pain,

375
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,841
but I can't have people
wandering through here.

376
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,676
All of this is going
to be my new turnpike.

377
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,178
It's also a crime scene.

378
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,014
Well, if it is, it's not
your jurisdiction, Sheriff.

379
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,766
Well, I'm with the FBI.

380
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,269
So the FBI is declaring this
a crime scene.

381
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,855
Oh, I think you're gonna need
better than that badge you got

382
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,857
out of
a Jacker Crack box, Betty.

383
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,860
In the meantime,
off my property.

384
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,361
[guns clicking]

385
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,571
Now.

386
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,209
Nana Rose,
my grandfather claimed

387
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,545
that you were
at the Chock'lit Shoppe
50 years ago

388
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,548
when a bright light
appeared in the sky.

389
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,218
Oh, yes, I remember it well.

390
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:24,223
My suspicion
is that the light came
from the Mothman ship.

391
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,142
The Mothman...again.

392
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,394
[Nana Rose] A few weeks
after the incident,

393
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:34,066
I found
a hideously misshapen body

394
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,651
in the Maple Forest.

395
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,487
A Mothman corpse?

396
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,741
An autopsy was performed.

397
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,994
An autopsy...
Like an alien autopsy?

398
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,247
Nana Rose, why has no one
heard about this before?

399
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,833
The Mothman
didn't want us
talking about it.

400
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:53,835
You spoke to them?

401
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,629
Well, they came to Thornhill

402
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,589
looking for
their missing friends.

403
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,718
They don't like to be known.

404
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,889
And they didn't like me
keeping their deceased either.

405
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,724
I told them
it had been cremated.

406
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,768
Had it been cremated?

407
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:14,982
No.

408
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,025
I kept it.

409
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,904
Perfectly preserved
in a barrel of maple syrup.

410
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:25,575
I could try to find it
for you, if you like.

411
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:31,665
Congratulations.

412
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,794
We've successfully introduced
50,000 River dollars

413
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,837
into our town's economy.

414
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,839
[students cheer and applaud]

415
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,341
So what's next?

416
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,592
We pump more money in.

417
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,137
Exactly. But how much more?

418
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:45,679
Another thousand?

419
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,848
-Ten thousand?
-[all] Ten thousand.

420
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:48,432
Wrong.

421
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,434
If we flood the market
with new bills,

422
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,893
we risk inflation

423
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,438
or triggering
a run on the bank, which is me.

424
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,024
And since I'm the one
on the hook,

425
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,319
I say we build our economy
slow and steady.

426
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,487
[Hiram] Very clever, mi hija.

427
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,990
Daddy.

428
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,908
I'm in the middle of a class.

429
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,535
I'm sorry for interrupting,

430
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,204
but I had to congratulate you
on your newest enterprise,

431
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,082
plastering your face
over currency.

432
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,668
Even at my most audacious,

433
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,086
that thought
never occurred to me.

434
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,297
Well, it's a good thing.
I've never limited myself

435
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,840
to what you thought possible.

436
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,175
-Hmm.
-Now, if you'll excuse me--

437
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:28,347
Oh, wait.
You and Archie, printing money,

438
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,182
starting a fire department.

439
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,558
Who does such things?

440
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,477
We believe in Riverdale,

441
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,020
and we're bringing it back.

442
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,314
Now really, Daddy,
take a hike.

443
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,695
Where were we?

444
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,405
[man laughs]

445
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,492
So then Sarge over here decides
to try and feed this stray dog

446
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,910
outside the outpost.

447
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,495
Now, this dog
looked more like a wolf to me.

448
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,205
Don't believe him,
it was a dog.

449
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,331
How big are we talking?

450
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,540
Well, timber wolf size.

451
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,709
Anyways, so Sarge
pours out this MRE

452
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,587
out onto his hand,
sticks it through the fence

453
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,340
then the dog
almost bites his arm off.

454
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,633
Show 'em your scars, Arch.

455
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,634
[chuckles]

456
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,968
[wheels squeaking]

457
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,179
Afternoon, sir.

458
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,640
How can we help you?

459
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,683
I thought
this place was shut down.

460
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,061
It was. We reopened it.

461
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,939
Now it's going to house
a new volunteer
fire department.

462
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,357
Do you live on Sketch Alley?

463
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,400
I do.

464
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,984
Name's Earl.

465
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,445
We haven't had
a fire department
in a long time.

466
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,697
A lot of buildings
burned down because of it.

467
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,157
Well, things are changing.

468
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,326
We're going to make this town
better for you,

469
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,745
your friends, for everyone.

470
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,372
Heard that talk before.

471
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,166
Hope you can back it up.

472
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:46,007
Come on, Glen. There has to be
someone you can send my way.

473
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,929
Betty, you have a Jane Doe
and two missing girls
with problematic histories.

474
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,514
You got to let the local
police handle this.

475
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,601
It's one Sheriff, Glen,
up against a rich psychopath

476
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,186
who won't let us search
his land.

477
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,272
-So I'm begging you--
-Betty.

478
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,942
He's back.

479
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,360
The Trash Bag Killer.

480
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,863
What?

481
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,449
TBK has reemerged,
in Tulsa, we think.

482
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,783
How many...

483
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,578
Are there any victims?

484
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,746
[Glen] Two, so far.

485
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,125
Look, why don't you send me
what you've got
and I'll see what I can do.

486
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,168
No, Glen.

487
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,462
Uh...

488
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,964
You focus on TBK.

489
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,133
Catch that bastard, okay?
I'm going to handle

490
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:32,220
everything here myself,
and I'll check in with you.

491
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,187
[screams]

492
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,190
[sighs]

493
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,538
[gun cocking]

494
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,998
Damn it, Betty!
We warned you.

495
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,833
You're trespassing
on private property.

496
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,585
I'm not going anywhere.

497
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:08,173
My sister is missing,
other girls too.
My mom is suffering.

498
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,425
And it's because of your boss
that I'm the only person

499
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,261
out here who can do
anything about it.

500
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,430
So if you want to stop me,
you're gonna have to shoot me.

501
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,433
[Reggie] Wait.

502
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,606
I found something
while patrolling the swamp.

503
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,191
But cone of silence,

504
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,236
Hiram can never know
I told you.

505
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,656
Okay. You have my word.

506
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,865
Cone of silence.

507
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,867
What is it?

508
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,036
Another body.

509
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,672
Cadet Burns!
When O2 rapidly enters

510
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,050
an oxygen-depleted environment
causing explosion,

511
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,843
what is that phenomenon called?

512
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,220
A backdraft, sir!

513
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,847
Correct! Your reward
is 30 more pushups.

514
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,266
Next question--

515
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,560
-You guys the fire department?
-Trying to be.

516
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,727
The pool hall's burning down.

517
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,896
What, right here on the alley?

518
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,148
-Let's move!
-Grab the hose. Go, go!

519
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,737
We got eyes on a connection,
right there.

520
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,406
Get the hose hooked up!
Arch, you get everyone back.

521
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,908
Earl's in there.
My friend Earl is still inside.

522
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,243
Arch, don't even
think about it.

523
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,163
-[man 1] No, Arch.
-[man 2] Archie, stop!

524
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,263
[sighs]

525
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,729
Mi hija, has the Treasury
Department shown up
to arrest you yet?

526
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,441
Daddy, that River dollar bill
you had in your fist,

527
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,942
where did you get that?

528
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,319
You know, it's amazing
what you find in the trash

529
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,737
when there's no one around
to collect it.

530
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,488
I knew it.

531
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,366
So now you're printing
fake River dollars
to sabotage me?

532
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,619
Are you accusing me
of counterfeiting
your counterfeit money?

533
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,913
My numbers aren't adding up,
and my numbers always add up.

534
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,292
Someone is flooding the economy
with money I didn't print.

535
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,294
Which, of course, devalues
the money you did print.

536
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,297
It's funny
how economics works, isn't it?

537
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,841
As Archie would say,
Daddy, you suck.

538
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,469
[engaged tone]

539
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,055
Where did you find this body,
Ms. Cooper?

540
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,394
I didn't exactly.
An associate did in the swamp.

541
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,314
And I know it's not Polly,
but is it--

542
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:29,981
Margaret Harper?

543
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,735
Yes. The telltale braces
are present on her teeth.

544
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:39,866
Likely cause of death, trauma.
The left side of her body
was pulverized.

545
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,410
As if with a wrecking ball.

546
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,121
Oh, my God.

547
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,212
Wherefore are
my precious Vixens?

548
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,963
I cancelled practice.

549
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,590
We need to talk.

550
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,510
For starters,
they're our Vixens,
as we agreed.

551
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,804
Fine, fine, fine.

552
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,014
They're our Vixens.
Happy now?

553
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,350
No, I wasn't
gonna do this, Cheryl,

554
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,519
but I'm officially
calling you out.

555
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,187
You've gotten away
with murder in this town

556
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,648
because of your money
and your privilege.

557
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,193
And I know you've been through
hell and back time and again.

558
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,446
But that doesn't give you
a right to be a holy terror
in this town for no reason.

559
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,740
As if you have any idea
what it's been like for me,

560
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,410
holed up in Thornhill
for the last seven years.

561
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,037
Oh, spare me.
This isn't Drag Me to Hell.

562
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,580
You cursed yourself.

563
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,999
And what you're doing
isn't some grand sacrifice.

564
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,376
It's selfish.

565
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,712
Oh, so now funding the school
is selfish?

566
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,798
Money alone isn't going
to solve the problems
of this town.

567
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,885
There are people out here
every single day
putting in real work.

568
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:44,097
And I'm not going to let you
take over the Vixens
for reasons of vanity

569
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,141
or revenge.

570
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:52,480
Cheryl, I want you out here
with us on the ground,
one of the good guys.

571
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,399
But you're going to have
to take a good hard look

572
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,526
in the mirror
and get it together first.

573
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,448
Your cruelty is beyond words.

574
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,163
[sighs]

575
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,669
Nana Rose, I need your wisdom.

576
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,255
My heart has once again
been shattered.

577
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,426
Oh, Miss Marple.

578
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,678
To what do we owe
this pleasure?

579
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,307
Ms. Blossom, I went to sell
your brother's portrait

580
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:31,186
and made the most disturbing
yet fascinating discovery.

581
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,396
It was a forgery.

582
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,025
A very skillful forgery.

583
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:41,154
And before I call
the authorities,
I thought we should chat.

584
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,031
Don't you agree?

585
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,786
What did Bernardo say, Sarge?

586
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,413
Rule number, one don't run
into a burning building alone.

587
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,457
You're never going to let me
live this down, are you?

588
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,125
No, sir.

589
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,668
Now, the good news is,
you're okay.

590
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,962
and you managed to save
that man's life.

591
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,214
Do we know
what started the fire yet?

592
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,216
No. I mean,
it's an old building.

593
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,550
It wasn't up to code.

594
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,260
Still, it's hard not to think
it was--

595
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,722
Arson. Probably started
by Hiram Lodge.

596
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,808
Wait. Who's Hiram Lodge?

597
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,142
He used to be mayor.

598
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,436
Now he's building
a new town next to here

599
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:18,149
and doing everything he can
to try and run the rest
of us stragglers out of here.

600
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,027
Another fat-cat
lining his pockets
by gaming the system.

601
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,029
Welcome to Riverdale.

602
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,405
All right, I'll see you fellas.

603
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,241
-Bye, Sheriff.
-Yeah.

604
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,995
Man, screw that Hiram guy.

605
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,747
That's okay, Eric.

606
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,168
This is just how life is,
for now.

607
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,838
No, it's how life always is.

608
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,216
Guys like us are just
cannon fodder
for scumbags like Hiram.

609
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:47,428
That guy you pulled out
of the building, Earl,
he's one of us.

610
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,181
A vet.
Another grunt who got chewed up

611
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,308
and spit out
by corporate greed.

612
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:57,397
Man, what the hell
are we fighting for over there

613
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:00,275
if this is what happens to us
when we come home?

614
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,287
A second body.
They found a second body
in the swamp.

615
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,997
How do you think
they did that, Reggie?

616
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,040
I don't know, boss.
It's a big swamp.

617
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,084
But this is not the hill
to die on.

618
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,752
No, no, no, the turnpike,

619
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:23,089
just like the rest of SoDale,
is a necessary smokescreen.

620
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,008
I know.

621
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,928
But you could either
be a villain and pour concrete
over the swamp

622
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,891
or you could be
a hero and let them
search it properly.

623
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,477
Sure, the turnpike
gets delayed, but who cares?

624
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,688
We both know
that's not the real end game.

625
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,402
You make a good point, Reggie.

626
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,070
We'll acquiesce
to the Cooper ladies.

627
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,031
Let them wade
into the muck awhile.

628
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,616
I'll make the call.

629
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,955
[Alice] We're so,
so sorry, Diana.

630
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,665
But you're...

631
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,210
You're sure it's my Margaret?

632
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:06,299
Yeah, it's her.

633
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:10,428
-No question.
-All these years...

634
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,847
[breathing shakily]

635
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,184
at least, at least now I know
where she is.

636
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,519
I can say goodbye.

637
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,316
Who hurt her?

638
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,526
We don't know yet, Miss Harper.

639
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,697
My sister's also missing.

640
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,450
Other girls, too.

641
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,205
And so I swear to you,

642
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,750
we will find out who did this.

643
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,887
-Wait. That's not--
-It is.

644
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,141
Yeah. A special delivery
courtesy of Nana Rose Blossom

645
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,394
straight from
the Twilight Zone.

646
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,988
Damn, the smell alone!

647
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,198
That's maple syrup
and decay.

648
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,658
It's like a rotting tooth.

649
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,159
It could be anything, Jughead.

650
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,619
It could be...
It could be human bones

651
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,454
mixed with fake
synthetic bones or--

652
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,747
Or it's a mothman.

653
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,710
-It's... It's--
-We're not experts.

654
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,255
-This person is, though.
-Who?

655
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,798
This is Dr. Diana Whitley.

656
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,675
She's an anthropology professor
at Centerville U.

657
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,760
She specializes
in ancient cultures

658
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,803
and urban legends

659
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,722
and extraterrestrial
phenomenon.

660
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,641
I say we call her and see
if she'll come here
and examine this

661
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,184
and tell us
what we're dealing with.

662
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,396
So what, in the meantime,
it's just business as usual,

663
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,982
while a xenomorph melts
in my diner's back room?

664
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,151
I'll take the night shift.
I'll make sure
that no one comes in,

665
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,278
and stumbles upon
our little friend.

666
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,282
[Veronica] We have to get
to the bottom of this.

667
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,868
I suspect my father
has flooded the market

668
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,203
with counterfeit bills,
so we'll have to do

669
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,665
an in-depth
forensic accounting,
recall all the River dollars

670
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,918
in circulation and determine
how deep a hole we're in.

671
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,590
But for now, sadly,
we'll have to shut down
our operation.

672
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,894
Where did you get those
ink stains on your paws?

673
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,645
And don't say art class.

674
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:28,316
I want the truth... now.

675
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,860
We printed up ten grand
instead of one.

676
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,448
Wow!

677
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,701
So it wasn't my father
who screwed me over.

678
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,410
It was you guys.

679
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,747
You got greedy and triggered
an economic collapse.

680
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,917
Well done class.
F's for everyone.

681
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,460
We're sorry.

682
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,004
What can we do?

683
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:54,258
Well, you're responsible
for that money you printed.

684
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,010
Ten thousand dollars.

685
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,845
And unless you've got
a secret stash

686
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:02,642
of baby Glamerge eggs,
you'll have to work it off

687
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,937
by providing Riverdale
a much-needed service.

688
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,532
-Jackson.
-Earl didn't make it.

689
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,953
No.

690
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,080
Yeah, and I found out more
about your pal Hiram Lodge.

691
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,958
That bastard's done plenty
to deserve what's coming
to him.

692
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,461
Jackson, you put
that rifle down now.

693
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,131
That's an order!

694
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,423
Sorry, Sarge,
but we're not
in the army anymore.

695
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,009
No, I'm sorry.

696
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,636
I won't let you do this.

697
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,055
I won't let you ruin your life
over Hiram Lodge.

698
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,475
My life's already ruined.

699
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,895
I lost my leg fighting in a war
that didn't change
a damn thing.

700
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,190
None of us mattered.

701
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:55,069
Eric, I know this is dark now,
but when you get into

702
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,072
that VA home
they'll help you see
that things can get better.

703
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,323
[laughs sarcastically]

704
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,576
They canceled my slot.

705
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,620
I found out this morning.
I needed help.

706
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,539
A lifeline. Man, I'm lost.

707
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,541
Damnit, I'm lost, Eric.

708
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,170
The only reason
I'm fighting so hard

709
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,881
to save this town is because
it's the only thing
keeping me sane.

710
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,301
I'm white knuckling it out
here too.

711
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,594
I promise you.

712
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,347
And my friends don't know

713
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,932
because they
wouldn't understand.

714
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,560
[sighs]

715
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,771
What are we gonna do, Sarge?

716
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,066
For a start...

717
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,446
I think you should stay
in Riverdale.

718
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,864
The fire department
needs a new commander,

719
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,325
and I can't think
of a better man for the job.

720
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:48,122
And maybe,
maybe we can help
each other stay sane.

721
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,154
[jukebox starts playing music]

722
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,834
[music distorts]

723
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,050
[rumbling]

724
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,702
[wind gusting]

725
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,758
[breathing heavily]

726
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,816
It was exactly as Pops said.

727
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,318
Things started to shake.
The jukebox turned on.

728
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,986
-Uh-huh.
-It was 2:00 a.m.

729
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,405
I went outside
and there was
this bright white light.

730
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:48,659
And then I woke up in a booth
and it was 6:00 a.m.

731
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,328
Hours had gone by. I lost time.

732
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:55,166
It was a dream prompted
by my grandpa's story.

733
00:38:55,207 --> 00:39:00,629
Or is it possible
that you were sleepwalking
or had you been drinking?

734
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,923
That's besides the point.

735
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,884
I haven't even gotten
to the craziest part yet.

736
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,178
Will you follow me? Please.

737
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,144
After I woke up,
the first thing I did
was come in here.

738
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,231
Oh, my God.

739
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,150
I don't understand.

740
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,903
Me neither, but something
very strange happened
in Riverdale last night.

741
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,658
Paying off your debt
while cleaning up the town,

742
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,745
if there ever was
a teachable moment.

743
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,664
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a delivery to make.

744
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,503
So what's up, guys?

745
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,879
Gossip around
the teacher's lounge

746
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:45,216
is that Weatherbee
nixed your RROTC cadets

747
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,176
from being
volunteer firefighters?

748
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,220
Yeah, well,
he was pretty pissed

749
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,263
I brought them
to a burning building.

750
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,350
Well, we want to sign up
like we should have done
in the first place.

751
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,644
I appreciate that, guys,
but it's too late.

752
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,313
Bernardo's back in New York,
there's no one left
to train us.

753
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,317
Maybe I can help on that front.

754
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,610
Chief Russell.

755
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,904
Word got around
about a crazy hero

756
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:10,157
running into
a burning building alone.

757
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,660
Got to say it inspired me.

758
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,912
Okay, Chief, you're the expert.

759
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,288
What do we need first?

760
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,750
Well, a fire truck
might be nice to have.

761
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,752
[siren wailing]

762
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,048
[Archie] You've got
to be kidding me.

763
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,593
Ronnie, what the hell!

764
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,303
What?

765
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,765
I wanted to do my civic duty
to help you and hurt my father.

766
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,559
How much do we owe you?

767
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,310
Oh, don't worry.
We'll be putting out

768
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,105
a Firefighters of Riverdale
calendar to defray the costs.

769
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:46,193
But in the meantime,
I just wanted to help.

770
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,113
Anything for you, Archie.

771
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:55,161
Two young women went missing
on the Lonely Highway.

772
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:58,289
Margaret Harper and Polly.
We found Margaret's remains

773
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,750
-in Swedlow Swamp,
-Where I found Polly's phone.

774
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,545
And we also found
another set of remains

775
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:08,299
in the swamp belonging to
an unidentified young woman.

776
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,551
And I reached out
to sheriff's offices

777
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,929
in the counties that touch
along the Lonely Highway,

778
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,349
asking about any unsolved
missing person's reports,

779
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,726
specifically young women.

780
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,145
They came back with 13 names.

781
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,148
And I've been in touch
with a network
of social workers

782
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,650
in towns the Lonely Highway
runs through,

783
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,027
and I got 11 names back,

784
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,779
five of which overlap
with Tom's list.

785
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,574
So, we're talking about
21 missing girls.

786
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,076
How many of them
are we going to find
in Swedlow Swamp?

787
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,871
Well, at least Hiram has agreed
to let us search it now.

788
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,500
Twenty-one girls,
they can't all be runaways.

789
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,751
Well, what do you think?

790
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,920
Human trafficking?

791
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,256
Or a serial killer.
