1
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:18,560
Jug, ever think we'd have a night
before the first day of school again?

2
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,645
No. Not in a million years.

3
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,689
I'm cramming to finish this book

4
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,774
my students were assigned
for summer reading.

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,278
Of Mice and Men.
Feel like I'm living in the Twilight Zone.

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,322
Gonna hit the sack. Big day tomorrow.

7
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:36,077
On behalf of Lennie, George and myself:
Good night, sweet prince.

8
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,876
After all these years, it's still adorable
to witness your back-to-school jitters.

9
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,963
I'd be there if I wasn't waiting
on our house diva.

10
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,632
Could you tell Queen T
my truck is leaving without her?

11
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,344
This outfit is a masterpiece
that can't be rushed.

12
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,888
And we're taking my motorcycle.

13
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,523
Ms. Topaz. Mr. Keller. Nice to see you.

14
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,818
- Good morning, Waldo.
- I'll never get used to that.

15
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,349
I thought economics class
was just for seniors.

16
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,684
Um... Some of us are auditing.

17
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,775
Well, as long
as you're taking it seriously.

18
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,280
We will talk about
my experiences overseas,

19
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:59,160
but the RROTC's focus is
on physical fitness and military history.

20
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,539
So, again, what year was
the United States Army founded?

21
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,500
This semester,
our main project in shop class

22
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:09,838
will be taking apart this classic car,
a 1954 Crestline,

23
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,881
and putting it back together.

24
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,092
Any questions before we get started?

25
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,220
Wasn't your dad, like, the Black Hood?

26
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,513
He was.

27
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,475
As a matter of fact, he taught me
everything I know about cars, so...

28
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,727
Any relevant questions?

29
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,023
Who did the summer reading?

30
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,863
Who can tell me what it was?

31
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,660
This is gonna be great.

32
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,665
By all rights,
that school should be shut down.

33
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,751
Instead, there are over
a hundred students enrolled.

34
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,671
What do you care, Mr. Lodge?
You got what you wanted.

35
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:55,091
Riverdale doesn't even exist
since you unincorporated it.

36
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:58,136
Reggie, a high school offers hope.

37
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,806
And people are sentimental
about Riverdale High

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,433
for reasons that elude me.

39
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,184
As long as it remains open,

40
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:09,272
there's a slight chance
the town will grow back around it.

41
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,441
Like a weed.

42
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,360
And that is bad for our business.

43
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,572
I hear you.
So, what are you thinking, boss?

44
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,745
As you can see,
this used to be a video store.

45
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,872
But with a little TLC,

46
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,584
it'll be the perfect spot
for my new jewelry store.

47
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,421
I cut my teeth in the Diamond District,
as you know, Smithers.

48
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,383
I can bring Manhattan magic to this town
formerly known as Riverdale

49
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,636
in the form of exquisitely high-end bling.

50
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,766
And will Mr. Gekko be involved
in this business enterprise?

51
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,310
I haven't decided yet.

52
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,188
He knows I'm in Riverdale,
teaching temporarily.

53
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,068
But the permanence of opening a shop
might send him spiraling.

54
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,908
Well, Ms. Cooper, how was the first day?

55
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,662
Well, they're terrified of me.

56
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,498
Being I'm the daughter of the Black Hood.

57
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,292
Ooh. That sucks.

58
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,671
Yeah. On top of which
I can't stop thinking about Polly.

59
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,800
Didn't your mom say she does this?
Takes off for a couple of days?

60
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,135
Yeah. That's why I'm trying not to panic.

61
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,390
Well, in the meantime,

62
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,017
maybe I can distract you.

63
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,436
Tonight?

64
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,233
- My new roommate's working at Pop's.
- It's too risky.

65
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:39,070
It's not like we can go to my house,
with my mom and the twins.

66
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,697
We're in our 20s.

67
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,866
It's supposed to be easier
to find places to hook up.

68
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,329
Wait. I think I have a crazy idea.

69
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,126
It is dead
as a doornail in here, Jones.

70
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:57,338
If you wanna write, by all means.
At least until we get some customers.

71
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,426
I was actually kind of hoping
I could interview you for my book.

72
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,221
Me? Why, what's your book?

73
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,807
It's about Riverdale.
People who live here.

74
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,603
- Portrait of a Small Town type of thing.
- Okay. What do you wanna know?

75
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,693
You left a six-figure-a-year job
in Chicago to come run Pop's?

76
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,155
You must have had
every CEO offer that you wanted.

77
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,660
Or I could become the CEO
of my family business.

78
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,205
And take everything I learned
at my fancy schools

79
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,751
and invest it in something meaningful.

80
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,879
I'm not playing around with Pop's.
I put in that gas pump out front

81
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,256
to attract truckers
driving the night shift.

82
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,593
I have ideas
for merchandising, franchising...

83
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,017
Just great.

84
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,691
Wait. Aren't you one of our teachers?

85
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,775
Yeah, I am.

86
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,737
Take a seat. I'll get the menus.

87
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,450
What the hell?

88
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,205
Get out of here, man! Go!

89
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,457
Archie, get the hose.

90
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,686
Thank God you were...
What did you say you were doing?

91
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,648
Well, luckily, I was out, um...

92
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,025
night-jogging,

93
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,902
and I heard the alarm go off.

94
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:29,323
I saw some Stonewall Prep students
rushing off. Some real bruisers.

95
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,911
Probably football players.
The Stonewall Stallions. Hiram's team.

96
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,956
He sponsors them.
In return, they do odd jobs for him.

97
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,875
Like setting our school on fire?

98
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,836
I can try arresting them,
but Hiram'll have them out on bail.

99
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,466
- Hiram's got the DA in his pocket.
- That's part of it. The other part is...

100
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,677
Stonewall Prep Stallions are
the county's best football team.

101
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,429
The only ones who win games.

102
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,514
As much trouble as they cause,

103
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,309
they're the only thing
people have to root for.

104
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:00,146
The Bulldogs and Bulldog Pride
are things of the past.

105
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,650
They're star football players, so what?
They can't be above the law.

106
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,944
Who's their coach? Hiram?

107
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,030
Not quite.

108
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,493
There you go, boy.

109
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,369
Quick feet, quick feet.

110
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,835
What's up, Andrews? Come to watch
a championship squad in action?

111
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,338
Reggie, you scumbag.

112
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,383
Your boys paid Riverdale High
a visit last night.

113
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,887
- I heard you had some trouble.
- You're not even denying it.

114
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,139
Why would I? Unless there's proof.

115
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,143
Send your squad to my school again

116
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,687
and I'll give you a beatdown
like you've never had.

117
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:47,151
As for you boys, I'm looking forward
to kicking your asses on the field.

118
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,043
Wow.

119
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,005
Inspired.

120
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,677
Yes, it's true, I work at Pop's.

121
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:17,765
I would love to say that working
at Riverdale High paid a livable wage,

122
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,893
but alas, I had to take a second job.

123
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,605
But aren't you supposed to be
some kind of bigtime writer?

124
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,945
The only writing I wanna talk about today
is Of Mice and Men.

125
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:35,491
So can anyone tell me
what this book is about?

126
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,747
Okay, plan B.

127
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,331
Pop quiz.

128
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,878
Hand these out.

129
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,222
Supply and demand

130
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,850
is the foundational principle
of economics,

131
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,144
so I'm gonna make sure that you all...

132
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,897
Special delivery for Ms. Gekko.

133
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,527
- Chad, what are you doing here?
- Surprising my wife.

134
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,740
- But I'm in the middle of a class.
- I'll just wait quietly at the back.

135
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,296
Mr. Weatherbee, uh, Waldo,

136
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,674
I wanna bring
Bulldog Football back as a coach.

137
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,594
I think having a football team
would be huge for school pride,

138
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,513
and it would help bring what's left
of this town back together.

139
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,851
- You know where we're at financially.
- I'll get the money. Somehow.

140
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,062
- Will you have enough players?
- I only need 11.

141
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,566
All right, Mr. Andrews,
let's see what you can do.

142
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,365
As you can imagine,
my wife tells this guy exactly

143
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:01,118
where he can stick his designer loafers.

144
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,245
Archie.

145
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,414
This is Chadwick, my husband.

146
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,209
- He surprised me with a visit.
- And cupcakes.

147
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,961
So you're the famous Archie.

148
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,631
Nice to meet you.

149
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,513
Well, we've survived
two days of the school year.

150
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,515
How about we celebrate tonight?

151
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:26,060
- It's Karaoke Tuesday at the Whyte Wyrm.
- Obviously, I'll be defying gravity.

152
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,021
As long as I can get a vodka tonic,
I will be watching.

153
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,773
- I don't know if we...
- Sounds good.

154
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,317
What? You hate karaoke.

155
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,902
What's that expression? Uh...

156
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,155
When in Rome, embarrass yourself
in front of total strangers.

157
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,415
- Betty, do you have a minute?
- Sure, what's up?

158
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,625
Kevin mentioned your sister's missing.

159
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,628
Yeah. Have you heard something?

160
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,798
You know how Fangs
and other Serpents are truckers now?

161
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,634
- Yeah?
- Well, I asked around.

162
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,679
And some of the guys
have occasionally seen Polly

163
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,391
hanging out at this sketchy truck stop
off the Lonely Highway.

164
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,726
- Doing what?
- Dealing for the Ghoulies.

165
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,937
Or hooking up with truckers.

166
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,481
- Or both.
- Yeah.

167
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,360
Sadly, Polly's not the only young woman
in Riverdale making a living that way.

168
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,531
Fangs said some truckers
arrange meetings with these women

169
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,199
by posting on Nedd's List.

170
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,618
I don't know if Polly has an account.

171
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,371
Yeah. Thank you, Toni. I'll look into it.

172
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,167
Do you know where exactly
this truck stop is?

173
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,629
The thing is,
the men have been threatening to quit.

174
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,131
Under no circumstances.

175
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,633
The constant hammering of nails
and buzzing of saws

176
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,094
is the only thing
that quiets my troubled soul.

177
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,931
Tell your brutes they'll get their money
and a bonus for their patience.

178
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,351
Now begone from my sight.

179
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,943
Thanks to that charitable donation
Toni squeezed out of me,

180
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,071
the Blossom coffers are empty, Nana.

181
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,324
It's time for Operation Goldfinch.

182
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,701
Call Crestby's to send an appraiser

183
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,120
whilst I finish my copy
of this portrait of Jay-Jay.

184
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,501
And pray my subterfuge will save us
from financial ruin.

185
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,382
According to my mom,
Polly doesn't have a laptop,

186
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,469
but I asked the twins
and they said she uses theirs.

187
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:27,515
So Polly doesn't have
a Nedd's List account, but Patty does.

188
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,017
Oh, my God. Check sent messages.

189
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,022
- Who was the last person she contacted?
- Someone named "TruckerBoy69."

190
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,400
And they arranged to meet up
the night she disappeared.

191
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,153
Either he knows something
or he did something.

192
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,448
Send him a message
asking to get together again.

193
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,119
Okay, sent.

194
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,582
Okay. Now we just wait, I guess.

195
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,210
Can we karaoke while we wait?

196
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,966
Cheers.

197
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,352
By the way, Jones,
I have the next subject for your book.

198
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,396
A real character.

199
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,024
- Oh, yeah? Who's that?
- Old Man Dreyfuss.

200
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,527
Lives on and runs a junkyard
off the Lonely Highway.

201
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,904
He came in today for pork chops

202
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,657
and I asked if you could
interview him for your book.

203
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,992
He said yes.

204
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,869
- Did you get his number?
- Oh, no.

205
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,746
Dreyfuss does not have a phone.
But I do have his address.

206
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,293
- Okay, what's his story?
- You've gotta ask him about the Mothmen.

207
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,420
The Mothmen?

208
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:44,842
All right, all right, we've got
a special treat for you guys.

209
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,845
She used to own this place
back in the day,

210
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,348
so let's give
an extra loud Whyte Wyrm welcome

211
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,268
to Veronica Lodge!

212
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,980
- She probably forgot it's Gekko now.
- Knock them dead, babe.

213
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,504
Good morning, lover.

214
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,090
Good morning, Ms. Gekko.

215
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,928
- Man, I haven't slept that well since...
- Forever.

216
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,430
I know.

217
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
Same.

218
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,982
It's fun having you here, Chad.

219
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,901
So...

220
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,324
Why don't I stay
in Riverdale for a few days?

221
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,534
What do you think?

222
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,413
I think that would be nice.

223
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,632
Congratulations,
you are the newest recruits

224
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,218
to Riverdale High's
legendary football program,

225
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,805
which will fulfill your physical education
requirements for this year.

226
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,182
- All good?
- Sir, yes, sir!

227
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,351
Six down. Five to go.

228
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,813
Who wants to play football
for the Bulldogs?

229
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,191
Welcome aboard.

230
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,276
And that's eight.

231
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,070
I'm looking for football players.

232
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,949
No previous experience required.
I just need a few more bruisers.

233
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,825
That's ten.

234
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,248
Who here wants to play for the Bulldogs?

235
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,420
Awesome. One more is all I needed.
What's your name, bro?

236
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,632
I'm Britta. Is that cool?

237
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,011
As long as you don't mind playing
both sides of the ball,

238
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,596
you complete my team.

239
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,266
Now I just need funding.

240
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,811
- How much funding?
- Twenty thousand.

241
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,898
- There's gotta be a sports budget...
- There is.

242
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,902
But the little money that's available has
already been earmarked for something else.

243
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:18,615
- What about Cheryl? Can you ask her?
- No way. I already called in my one favor.

244
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,242
Nobody's stopping you.

245
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,954
You need
more money from me, you say?

246
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,498
Yes. For the football team.

247
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:31,962
I've already done my part for the school.
And at a great personal cost.

248
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,048
Cheryl, I just thought...

249
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,053
given the fact
your brother was a Bulldog...

250
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,681
you might wanna honor him.

251
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,767
How dare you play my brother
as if he were a red king card.

252
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,146
Begone! And never darken
the halls of Thornhill again.

253
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,191
Leave!

254
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,369
When did the appraiser
say he was coming?

255
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,247
Oh, she, dear. Minerva Marble.

256
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,375
And tomorrow, she said.

257
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,379
TruckerBoy69 responded.

258
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,965
He said, "So good to hear from you, Patty.

259
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,802
I was afraid you were still mad at me.
How's tonight?"

260
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,388
- Mad about what?
- That's what I'm gonna find out

261
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,350
when we go stake out
the truck stop he suggested,

262
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,018
right off Exit 42.

263
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,467
Hi there. I'm Jughead Jones.
I work at Pop's with Tabitha Tate.

264
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,470
She told me you'd be willing
to tell me the story about the, uh...

265
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,806
The Mothmen.

266
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,939
About 30, 40 years ago,

267
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,109
me and some buddies got hired
to dig out a collapsed mine

268
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,194
not far off the Lonely Highway.

269
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,697
One night, we went to bed,

270
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,618
and the next morning, when we woke up,
one of the guys, Ramos, was missing.

271
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,330
We worked the whole day,
but Ramos never showed.

272
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,581
Until the next morning...

273
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,876
when Ramos was back,

274
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,379
but Raymond was missing.

275
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:42,634
Ramos told us that some Mothmen
had taken him up in their ship

276
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,428
and now they had Raymond.

277
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,473
- Did you believe him?
- Not at first.

278
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,768
But the next morning, Raymond was back,

279
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,854
but Arnold was missing.

280
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,398
And sure enough, Raymond said

281
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,984
the Mothmen had taken him up
in their ship.

282
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,531
Now, when you say "Mothmen,"
are you talking...?

283
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:08,785
Aliens, angels, Mothmen,
call them whatever you like.

284
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,998
They live in the woods
and the caves off the Lonely Highway.

285
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:20,047
I've lived in Riverdale my whole life,
why haven't I heard of the Mothmen before?

286
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,716
There were some articles.

287
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,427
Ask around, some people remember.

288
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,097
Aren't you worried
that they're gonna come back?

289
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,307
I'm not afraid.

290
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,602
I'm hoping.
I'm hoping they come back for me.

291
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,313
I wanna go up in their ship
like the others.

292
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,499
This is definitely the place.

293
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,807
Frankview Freight Lines.

294
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,393
That's him, in the blue rig.
That's Truckerboy69.

295
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,020
What? Betty, are you sure?

296
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,410
You're not Patty.

297
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:36,748
No, I'm her sister, and I'm with the FBI.
You're coming with me.

298
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,506
I keep saying, I didn't do anything wrong.

299
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,676
You arranged to meet
my sister at that truck stop

300
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,929
and that's the last time
anyone's seen her.

301
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:55,267
Look, I did meet Patty three nights ago.

302
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,019
She'd scored some jingle-jangle
and reached out.

303
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,313
- We met up at the truck stop...
- And then what?

304
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,900
I told her that we should take a drive,
to clear her mind.

305
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,402
She was down with that plan.

306
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,697
But a half a mile up the highway,
she freaked.

307
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,199
Jumped out of the truck, started running.

308
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,119
I tried to get her back in my cab,
but she just kept running.

309
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,331
That's the last time I saw her.

310
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,125
Honest to God.

311
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,253
So you just left her there?
On the side of the road?

312
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,130
I didn't have a choice.

313
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,924
Patty was scared.
I didn't wanna make it worse.

314
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,218
What part of the highway?

315
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,762
I need you to be very specific.

316
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,060
Hey, honey.

317
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,397
What's going on? Why are you home so late?

318
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,815
It's about Polly, Mom.

319
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,652
I have a lead I need your help with.

320
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,823
But you should sit down.

321
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,662
I'm sorry, team.

322
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,374
I should've gotten my ducks
in a row first, secured the funding.

323
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,711
And the school really can't give us
any money? At all?

324
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,923
No. There's no funding
for sports, clubs, extra...

325
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,279
Toni, since when are the Vixens back?

326
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,324
Since I made it a priority in the budget.

327
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,119
There isn't even a sports team
for them to cheer for.

328
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,498
Get over yourself, Archie.
The Vixens are a sports team.

329
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:45,252
And this year, we're gonna be competing
against other squads.

330
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,295
Not even Cheryl managed to do that.

331
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:01,851
Forget the school. Isn't there anyone else
who could sponsor the Bulldogs?

332
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,073
It's Doris Bell.

333
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,785
You told me to keep you apprised
of goings-on at the school.

334
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:24,040
Well, there's something
I think you should know.

335
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,003
I see. Thanks, Ms. Bell.

336
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,261
So sorry for the interruption, Ms. Marble.

337
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,597
How are you finding that portrait
of my beloved brother?

338
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,394
Figurative is back in vogue,
and the artist who painted your brother

339
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,480
was chosen
for next year's Venice Biennale.

340
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,817
I believe
this portrait could easily fetch...

341
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,778
a quarter of a million at auction.

342
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,531
And worth every penny.

343
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,867
I wonder...

344
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,289
might I get to keep my Jay-Jay
for one more night?

345
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,292
So we can say our proper ta-ta's?

346
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,960
I understand.

347
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:13,340
I'm staying at the Five Seasons,
but I'll be around in the morning.

348
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,843
Even better,
I'll have my men deliver it to you.

349
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:20,347
Hm. Well, it was a pleasure
dealing with you.

350
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,017
Should you decide to sell
any other items, do let me know.

351
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,186
I will indeed, Ms. Marble.

352
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,863
Now that's she's authenticated
our original,

353
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,449
we can swap in your perfect copy.

354
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,535
And Marble shall be none the wiser.

355
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,748
But what's the matter, child?

356
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,876
Oh. Nothing, Nana.

357
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,296
Just some upsetting news
from Riverdale High.

358
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,631
I'll be fine.

359
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,351
Betty!

360
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,814
Oh, my God. No. Oh.

361
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,945
These are her things.

362
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,323
These are Polly's things.

363
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,123
- More coffee, champ?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jug.

364
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,292
How goes it with the Bulldogs?

365
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,044
It doesn't.

366
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,131
The kids don't have any equipment.
They can't afford equipment.

367
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,591
And the school doesn't have any money.

368
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,053
If you promise to never bring up
the epic highs and lows

369
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,724
of high school football, I can ask Tabitha
if she's willing to sponsor the team.

370
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,850
Yeah. Can't hurt.

371
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,644
There is one more person I can ask.

372
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,689
Veronica.

373
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,859
But that'd be weird, right?

374
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:59,779
I interviewed a guy who wants
to be abducted by Mothmen aliens.

375
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,449
I think weird is relative.

376
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,118
I say go for it. Embrace the weird.

377
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,789
What do you think, Chad?

378
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:14,627
I know it's a tad sleazy, but it's
the perfect spot for a jewelry store.

379
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,714
Good foot traffic, close to SoDale.

380
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,508
The only bad thing is,
it's not in New York.

381
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,386
But maybe that's the whole point, huh?

382
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,848
Cards on the table, Chadwick.

383
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,434
Being back in Riverdale,
seeing my friends,

384
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,436
working on a new business,

385
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,521
it's been good for my soul.

386
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:38,026
So we'd have a place in the city
and a place in Riverdale.

387
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,904
- Where I'd be welcomed?
- Yes.

388
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,324
But I need your support on this, Chad.

389
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
And love.

390
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:47,826
You have it.

391
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,378
Are we gonna buy a new house
or stay at the Pembrooke?

392
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:01,132
Bite your tongue,
I'm never leaving that apartment.

393
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,552
But it could do with a remodel.

394
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,805
It's time for a change.

395
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,432
Starting with a clean slate.

396
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,144
What happened to her, Betty?

397
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,855
What happened to Polly
out on that highway?

398
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,732
I don't know, Mom.

399
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:23,863
But I do know one thing,
if that creepy guy in jail had hurt Polly,

400
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,241
he wouldn't have told us where to go.

401
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,953
So we have nothing. We have no leads.
She could be anywhere.

402
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,622
- We didn't find Polly's cell phone.
- No.

403
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,542
So we can trace it
through the phone company.

404
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,919
Or if they can't, maybe the FBI can.

405
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,545
And if not?

406
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,346
We wait.

407
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,767
And we hope.

408
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,984
So I need to be back in the city
on Monday, the 19th.

409
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,570
Fine. We have your niece's
birthday party that weekend.

410
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,446
So Mondays through Thursdays,

411
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,032
I'm in the city,
then here every other weekend.

412
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,702
And I'll be in New York
every other weekend.

413
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,878
You know, there is one other option
that your father suggested.

414
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:25,300
I could move to Riverdale full-time
and help him manage the SoDale properties.

415
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,637
You're in finance, not real estate.

416
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,600
And wait. Have you and my father
been talking behind my back?

417
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,442
- Archie.
- Hey. Sorry to come by unannounced.

418
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,776
Don't be. Come in.

419
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,531
Archie. This is unexpected.

420
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,408
Chad. Hey, you're still here.

421
00:31:55,288 --> 00:32:00,752
Um... Listen, the thing is, I'm restarting
the football team at Riverdale High.

422
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,380
And there's no budget for anything.

423
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,757
Say no more.

424
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,050
As a former Vixen,

425
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,636
I made an oath to always support
my beloved Bulldogs.

426
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,638
I will cover the start-up costs.

427
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:15,016
Thank you, Veronica.
I promise I'll pay you back 100%.

428
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,144
You mean, pay us back 100%.

429
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,729
Of course.

430
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,565
Pay you guys back.

431
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,108
Thank you, Chad.

432
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,987
You know, actually,
now I think about it...

433
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,990
you're a vet, a proud guy.

434
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,785
You don't wanna be taking handouts.

435
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,287
So how's this for an idea?

436
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,872
Instead of us loaning you the money,

437
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,459
what if you renovate our apartment,
this apartment?

438
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,169
What are you talking about?

439
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,589
We help out Archie's team,
he does this job for us and gets paid.

440
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:50,218
I'm sure Archie has other things
he's gotta be doing.

441
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,386
No, it's fine.

442
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,597
I don't wanna be taking handouts.

443
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,184
I'll call some of my dad's old crew,
see if they can help out.

444
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,395
Awesome sauce.

445
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,065
- Thanks again.
- Of course. See you at school tomorrow.

446
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,699
Okay. What the hell was that?

447
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,325
He's my friend.

448
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,870
I'm sure he'd rather do a little work
than crawl to you for charity.

449
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,914
You didn't have to be
such a dick about it.

450
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:20,998
Excuse me.

451
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,669
Have I not been accommodating to you
since I've been here?

452
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,171
I've been nice to your friends.
I even sang karaoke.

453
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,757
I didn't realize
those were such chores for you.

454
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,969
They weren't.

455
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,764
I wanted to do them for you.

456
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,060
If I came across dick-îsh
with Archie, I'm sorry.

457
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,397
It won't happen again, okay?

458
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,316
Okay.

459
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Good.

460
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,154
What's for dinner?

461
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,907
Can we get Pop's takeout?

462
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,869
I can't handle another greasy burger
and onion rings.

463
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,620
Let's go out.

464
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,542
There's this Italian place
that your dad mentioned. Mia's?

465
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,049
Sure.

466
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,218
Let's go to Mia's.

467
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,644
Are you working
on your Mothmen chronicles?

468
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,521
It is so bizarre, Tabitha.

469
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,607
I ended up talking to Old Man Dreyfuss.

470
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,901
He did tell me the people
he used to worked with.

471
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,111
All of his buddies from back in the day.

472
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:36,115
Tracked them down,
just so I could corroborate his story.

473
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,618
Get this.

474
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:40,953
They're all dead.

475
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,249
Couldn't that be a coincidence
because they're old?

476
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:50,129
Curiously, they all died from cancer,
and, yeah, that could be a coincidence.

477
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,422
But maybe...

478
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,050
just maybe...

479
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:59,055
they were all exposed to the same
radiation on the spaceship. Hmm?

480
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,933
Ah. Is that what happens
when you go aboard a spaceship?

481
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,060
No idea. But it makes a great story.

482
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,896
What's the next step?

483
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,399
Dreyfuss said that some articles
were produced after their encounter,

484
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,693
so I'm just tracking those ones down.

485
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,862
I'm in.

486
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,866
If you want some help.

487
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,996
Unless you're like the lone-wolf type
or whatever.

488
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,748
Sure.

489
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,420
More the merrier.

490
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,597
- Betty.
- Hey.

491
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,891
- Is Jughead home?
- No. He's working.

492
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:51,440
My mom and I are waiting to hear
something, anything about Polly.

493
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,776
And she's driving me crazy.

494
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,698
Yeah. I'm feeling pretty crazy
and frustrated myself.

495
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,463
Let's go upstairs.

496
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,769
- Is that me?
- It's me, I think.

497
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,527
Yeah. It's my friend Todd
from the academy.

498
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,654
It's probably about Polly's phone.

499
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,952
I should go, but this... was really nice.

500
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,304
What's this?

501
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,183
Chad...

502
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,646
upon reflection,
I think we need to pump the brakes.

503
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,485
Back in New York,

504
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,237
I had the instinct that

505
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,657
we should take some time
to be by ourselves.

506
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,535
And as fun as the last few days have been,

507
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,121
I still think we need a break.

508
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,958
- Because of Archie?
- No, Chad.

509
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,126
Because of me.

510
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:39,423
Because I need real time and space
to figure out if I'm a Pop's girl...

511
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,425
or a Mia's girl...

512
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:43,885
or both.

513
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,058
That's not gonna be a problem, is it?

514
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,643
Not at all.

515
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,064
Let me know when you're ready to talk.

516
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,286
Cheryl.

517
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,330
Hi, Toni.

518
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,333
I was gonna give you a call,
and then I thought:

519
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:18,879
"Hmm. No, stealing my Vixens
warrants a visit in person."

520
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:26,178
You're playing
a very dangerous game, Topaz.

521
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,891
You've each been assigned a locker.

522
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:35,646
That's to go along with your new cleats,
your new uniform and pads.

523
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,983
I'm also psyched to announce
our generous sponsor for all this stuff

524
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,402
and other expenses is Veronica Gekko.

525
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,530
Lodge, actually. Veronica Lodge.

526
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,490
Okay.

527
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,118
You heard the lady.

528
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,495
Let's give her a round of applause.

529
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,004
You asked me to call if anything
interesting or important happens.

530
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:05,551
Well, you should know what's going on
in the boys' locker room right now.

531
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,261
I see.

532
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:14,894
Well, thank you, Ms. Bell.
Your information is very much appreciated.

533
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,520
We'll be in touch.

534
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:19,939
You see...

535
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,111
- now I'm angry.
- What happened?

536
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,822
Archie Andrews made good
on his promise to you

537
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,366
and started a football team.

538
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,161
With my daughter's money.

539
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,000
So maybe this time, we pay him a visit.

540
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,337
I heard from my friend Todd
at the FBI.

541
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,673
He traced the call
to somewhere in this region.

542
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,050
Swedlow Swamp?

543
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,886
What was Polly doing there?

544
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:53,349
How are we gonna find her?
That's acres and acres of marshland.

545
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,936
We'll have to keep calling
her cell phone until we hear it ring.

546
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,399
Assuming it's still charged.

547
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,869
We've been out here for hours.

548
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,080
I'm freezing. Maybe we should...

549
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,249
Shh. I hear something.

550
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,460
Let's split up.

551
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,181
Guys. Guys, over here!

552
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,349
What?

553
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,693
Archie, there's a fire!

554
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,161
On the back porch too!
