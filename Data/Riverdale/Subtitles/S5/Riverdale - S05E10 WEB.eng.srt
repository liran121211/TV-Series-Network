1
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,261
This one's
for all you night owls

2
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,054
burning the candle at both ends.

3
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,889
Stay hungry, my friends.

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,643
Aw, this one is
one of my all-time favorites.

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,187
Duran Duran? Top five for me.

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,439
For sure.

7
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,875
- Sorry. I should go.
- I'll... No, I'll go.

8
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,627
- I have school tomorrow. So I gotta...
- Yeah.

9
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,962
...get to those damn kids.

10
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:49,299
Totally. I will see you later, then.

11
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,594
Hey, I was thinking since I'm in town,

12
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,263
it might be nice
to get to know your family.

13
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:59,976
Well, with Polly missing, my mom is
pretty much my family. And the twins.

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,564
But I wanted to tell you, I asked Jughead
Jones to meet us at the FBI office.

15
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,941
He's been helping me with the case.

16
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,527
This is an official FBI investigation now.

17
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,239
No Jugheads allowed. Tell him.

18
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:18,536
Okay. So, what is your strategy
moving forward?

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,206
The Lonely Highway is 200 miles long.

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,376
How many rest stops are along it?
How many stretches of beaches or marsh?

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,504
- How many cul-de-sacs?
- I get it.

22
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,798
There's ground to cover.
Let's start covering it.

23
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,924
We already have.

24
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,846
I've got ten agents on the Lonely Highway,
searching every lot, field and ditch.

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,432
Okay. Shouldn't I be canvassing with them?

26
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,393
No, I need your expertise here

27
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,355
with something I'm surprised
you haven't brought up yet...

28
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,397
your father.

29
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,778
Some of the remains date back
to when he was still alive

30
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,863
and actively killing people.

31
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,783
There have been murders since he died.

32
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:00,286
We should be looking
for someone in their 50s or older.

33
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,081
Or you buy my theory
that it's an assortment of killers.

34
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,167
- What if your dad's one of many?
- What do you want me to be doing?

35
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:10,713
Didn't your father undergo extensive
analysis at the Sherwood Asylum?

36
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,134
- Yeah.
- Let's start with reviewing those tapes.

37
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,098
Parent-Teacher Night
is always nerve-racking.

38
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,684
But this one is make it
or break it for us.

39
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,018
We need to show the parents

40
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,355
that we can educate and protect their kids
during these troubled times.

41
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,067
Archie, I'd like you to join Kevin
in giving tours of the school.

42
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,611
Good idea. With Toni out
on bed rest for her pregnancy,

43
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,239
- we're short on tour guides.
- I can do that.

44
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,991
Oh, Chadwick.

45
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,035
Since you picked up, does this mean
you've signed the divorce papers?

46
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,497
No, Veronica. I'm your husband
and you're my wife.

47
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,458
And what we went through
binds us for life.

48
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,711
For God's sake, Chad.

49
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:53,423
Stop wasting my time
and sign the damn papers.

50
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,180
Cheryl Blossom, have you lured me
out here to seduce me?

51
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,850
Hmm. Mayhap, Minerva.

52
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,731
But it's also time to harvest
our sweet, sweet sap,

53
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:13,151
which will become
this year's bounty of maple syrup.

54
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,319
What is it?

55
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:20,658
I'm shooketh.
Our maple trees have always provided.

56
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,911
This is your fault.

57
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,914
You are not meant to be happy.

58
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,874
The curse won't allow it.

59
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,712
The maple groves will be nothing
but a burden on us, barren.

60
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,757
We must pray for deliverance.

61
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,510
The only praying that needs to happen
is for sanity,

62
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,263
which you seem to be sorely lacking.

63
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,765
Ta-ta, Nana.

64
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,772
- Samm, what's the good word?
- I got great news, pal.

65
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:54,442
Pop Culture Weekly wants to publish
an excerpt from your new book.

66
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,111
That's great exposure.
What are we sending?

67
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,615
That's the rub. Pop Culture Weekly
wants something more...

68
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,660
sensational than what you've been writing.

69
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,288
Yeah, aliens as a metaphor for trauma.
I'm still trying to get underneath that.

70
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,583
Great. But they usually give this slot
to Stephen King.

71
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,294
Maybe you can channel him
instead of Raymond Carver.

72
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,378
Bye, Jones.

73
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,509
You betrayed me at that game.

74
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:23,763
Mr. Lodge, you're right.
It won't happen again.

75
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,515
You have my loyalty.

76
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,726
That's a lovely mea culpa,
but that football game

77
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,813
sparked some life
into the former town of Riverdale.

78
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,400
You can feel its broken spirit rebuilding.

79
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:40,321
Riverdale High, which should be rubble,
is hosting a Parent-Teacher Night.

80
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,659
What can I do to redeem myself?

81
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,580
- Do you know what palladium is?
- It's like gold, right?

82
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,042
Only rarer and more valuable.

83
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,838
I've been digging for it
behind my prison walls.

84
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,967
But the palladium vein beneath it
is completely tapped

85
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,052
and is yielding next to nothing.

86
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,974
Now we need to move to the vein
underneath the Blossom Maple Groves.

87
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,227
Luckily, I have an idea
that will take care of the prison

88
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,563
and help bring about
Riverdale's ruination.

89
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,315
What do you need me to do?

90
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:19,694
I'll handle the prison.
You get me those groves.

91
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,821
On it, boss.

92
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,703
- General Taylor.
- At ease, sergeant.

93
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,457
I didn't want to say anything
until top brass signed off on it,

94
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,502
but I nominated you for a Silver Eagle
Medal for your last mission.

95
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,964
For acts of bravery under enemy fire
and overwhelming odds.

96
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,969
All due respect, sir, but that mission
was a disaster. I lost ten men.

97
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,054
So did I.

98
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,973
But you saved Corporal Jackson's life.

99
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,685
- Carried him 14 miles on your back.
- I appreciate this, truly.

100
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,147
But accepting an honor for that mission
just doesn't feel right to me.

101
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,649
I'm sorry to hear that.

102
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,736
But you will be accepting
the Silver Eagle.

103
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,404
And that's a direct order.

104
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,700
Now, brief me on how
your recruitment efforts are going.

105
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,963
Screw you, Stephen King.

106
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,644
- What's up?
- There's something on this tape.

107
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,983
How were relations
between you and your wife Alice?

108
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,985
We weren't in a good place.

109
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,947
She wouldn't touch me or even look at me.

110
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,158
So I started connecting
with women on Nedd's List...

111
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,163
That's how women working the
Lonely Highway make their connections too.

112
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:07,760
Ms. Veronica, this arrived for you
at the Pembrooke. It's from Mr. Gekko.

113
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,345
From Chad?

114
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,640
Ugh. Pray to God
these are my divorce papers.

115
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,243
I'd like to pose a question that goes
to the heart of being a soldier:

116
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:38,666
When issued an order,
do you follow it without question?

117
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,376
Sir, yes, sir.

118
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,502
Good answer.

119
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,338
What if you don't believe in that order?

120
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,759
What's your responsibility then?
What do you do?

121
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,638
You follow the order, Sergeant Andrews.
No questions asked.

122
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:58,144
Anyone, even a general,
is capable of making a wrong call, sir.

123
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,901
My granddaughter is not at home.

124
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:10,740
And you, dear boy,
are certainly not her type.

125
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:15,745
I'm actually here to see you, Ms. Blossom.
About your lovely groves.

126
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,248
May I come in?

127
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,757
I don't know why Juniper
and Dagwood can't share a cake.

128
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,471
Cooper residence.

129
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,642
Are Juniper and Dagwood all right?

130
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,728
What kind of accident?

131
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,484
So I have a favor to ask.

132
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,195
Can I j...? Can I say something first?

133
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,491
I'm sorry that I tried to kiss you.

134
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,953
That was totally inappropriate of me.

135
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,871
Well, I leaned in too.

136
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,292
I'm sorry. Things are just complicated
for me right now.

137
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,837
I know you've met Betty.
She and I had a terrible breakup

138
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,382
back in high school,
and I never really recovered.

139
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:14,053
And my most recent relationship
was more toxic than nuclear waste.

140
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,721
Define "toxic."

141
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:21,018
It's this girl, Jessica.
Um, she's also a writer.

142
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:26,357
We would drink a lot, party a lot.
We'd fight, break up, get back together.

143
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,279
Got it. Well, then, as they say,
let's just be friends.

144
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:37,785
So as your friend, can I ask you my favor?

145
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,370
Sure.

146
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,999
So Pop Culture Weekly wants to run
an excerpt on my new book,

147
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:47,295
which is great,
but I'm having bad writer's block.

148
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,674
Like when I was back in New York
before I finished The Outcasts.

149
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,801
Well, what'd you do back then?

150
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,011
Maple mushrooms.

151
00:09:56,345 --> 00:10:00,516
Yup. I took a trip,
had some psychedelic visions,

152
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,853
and when I came to,
I had written 500 pages.

153
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,314
By ingesting magic fungi?

154
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:12,445
I have, uh, some personal trauma
that I can't access.

155
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:18,284
I'm hoping that these maple mushrooms
will allow me to break through.

156
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,956
So I need someone that I trust
to just watch over me,

157
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,251
make sure I don't get into any trouble
while I'm under.

158
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:31,255
I'm sorry, Jughead,
but I can't help you with this.

159
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:37,136
As your friend, I don't think
you should be doing psychedelics,

160
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,806
alone or with me.

161
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,561
Why do you have to go back?
You don't owe him anything.

162
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,813
I do.

163
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,617
A few years ago, Chad and I went
to a party on Marcia's Vineyard.

164
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,287
We had too much to drink
and got into a terrible fight.

165
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:07,750
And I was so angry that I...

166
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,213
I wished he would just die...

167
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,385
put me out of my misery of a marriage.

168
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:21,972
Okay, so you had...
You had a dark thought.

169
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,974
So has everyone.

170
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:29,063
True. But that night, we left.

171
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,734
We got into the helicopter
to fly back to the city.

172
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,823
Chad was at the stick,
something malfunctioned,

173
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,034
and the next thing I know,

174
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,747
I'm waking up
in Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.

175
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,873
What?

176
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,459
The helicopter crashed?

177
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,089
- You didn't do anything wrong.
- I did.

178
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,008
I wished him dead.

179
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,053
And then I stayed with him out of guilt.

180
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,682
Now I have to face him, Archie,

181
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,143
if only to get closure.

182
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,897
And then I'll be on the first train
the next morning.

183
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,192
The next morning? Does that mean...?

184
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,237
No, no. I'm staying with Katy
in Washington Heights.

185
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,366
And once all of this is behind us,

186
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,827
we'll be free to be together.

187
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,588
Sweethearts, what happened
at school today?

188
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,427
Your principal seems to think
that you pushed your classmate

189
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,055
down some stairs on purpose.

190
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,141
Jerry said Mommy was dead.

191
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,854
Jerry got a concussion
and he broke his shoulder.

192
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,358
And it could've been much, much worse.

193
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,321
Juniper, Dagwood. He could've died.

194
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,202
How dare you, Nana.

195
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,204
These groves were my birthright.

196
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,665
- You had no right to sell them.
- The groves are worthless.

197
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,127
Now we've passed them on,
the curse shall be upon them.

198
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,297
There is no curse!

199
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,727
Hey, Speedy. Yeah, it's Jones.

200
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,773
Yeah, I know, it's been a while.
How are you? Good.

201
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,235
How is that stock
of maple mushrooms holding up?

202
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,863
Great. No, but I moved.

203
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,616
I'm in Riverdale now.
Could you send a runner?

204
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,287
That's awesome, man.
Cool, you are the best. Thanks.

205
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,215
Hello?

206
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,927
Sergeant Andrews, this is
Sara Bellum with The New York Times.

207
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,389
I'm calling about
your last tour of duty. In Uzbekistan.

208
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,640
What about it?

209
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,518
I've been investigating your CO,
General Taylor,

210
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,646
who I believe sent you
on a dirty mission. Can we meet?

211
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,360
They pushed a kid down the stairs, Glen,
on purpose.

212
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,487
And they had no remorse, none.

213
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,449
I'm worried that they're bad seeds, like...

214
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,868
I'd like to meet them.

215
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,495
- Especially after what you've told me.
- Why?

216
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,541
I mean, you're also trying to get
to know my mom better.

217
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,544
What gives?

218
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,255
I guess you'd find out eventually.

219
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,055
"Family of Darkness:

220
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:55,311
Varying Displays of the Serial Killer Gene
in the Cooper Family Tree."

221
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,856
Glen, what is this?

222
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,441
It's my dissertation.

223
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,944
About me and my family?

224
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:09,325
Yeah. Betty, the Coopers
are a perfect case study

225
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,951
of nature versus nurture.

226
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,247
Look, you and Charles both have the genes.

227
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,499
He's a serial killer, you're not.

228
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,630
Your father didn't have the genes,
but he was a murderer. Why?

229
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,259
Glen, people are dying...

230
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,386
People are dying on the Lonely Highway,

231
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,641
and you're working on a... A term paper?

232
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,018
Is this why you came to Riverdale?

233
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,854
I came for both reasons.

234
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,357
Okay, fine. Then I quit.

235
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,942
You're not gonna do that.

236
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,612
You need me to find your sister.

237
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,784
And besides,
aren't we having a good time here?

238
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,373
Does that answer your question?

239
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,550
It's messed up, Uncle Frank.

240
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,220
My CO, General Taylor,
arrived in Riverdale,

241
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,682
wanting to award me the Silver Eagle Medal
for my last mission.

242
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,101
Then I got a call from a reporter

243
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,394
at The New York Times

244
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,731
who's investigating that mission, among
others, all ordered by General Taylor.

245
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,193
I think General Taylor's trying
to get ahead of this investigation.

246
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,988
And I think that mission I led was shady,

247
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,241
and now he's trying to turn it
into some kind of heroic event.

248
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,786
Yeah, well, it'd be harder to discredit
a mission that's celebrated

249
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,832
and splashed all over the news.
Taylor wouldn't be the first general

250
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,167
trying to buy a soldier's loyalty
with a medal.

251
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,129
So, what do I do?

252
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,881
Do you wanna be the guy
who helps sell the cover-up

253
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,092
or the guy who stands up against it?

254
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,178
I won't disrespect
the sacrifice my men made.

255
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,390
Good, you hold on to that.

256
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,018
Even if you're called before the Senate.

257
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,272
I appreciate the counsel.
By the way, how are you holding up?

258
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:09,695
It's, uh, kind of strange in here, Arch.
Something's brewing.

259
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,197
You can feel it. Like a riot.

260
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,408
Keep your head down and lay low.

261
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,453
I gotta run.
It's, uh, Parent-Teacher Night.

262
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,498
All right. Good luck out there, soldier.

263
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,838
I asked for the groves and you delivered.

264
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,424
Welcome back to the fold, Reggie.

265
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,427
So when do we start to dig?

266
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,387
Let's say two weeks.

267
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,683
But first, we savor
tonight's fireworks at my jail.

268
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,312
Nice try, you simpletons.

269
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,773
But you'll be shocked to learn
the contract you have

270
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,025
is totally devoid of meaning.

271
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,778
I had Nana Rose declared legally senile
half a decade ago.

272
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,197
She has no power to do anything.

273
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,866
Now it's time for you to accept the fact

274
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:59,620
that you will never get
my precious groves.

275
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,788
Toodles.

276
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:08,378
- Mr. Lodge, I th...
- No. No, no. No excuses. Just fix it.

277
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,224
Jess. What are you doing here?

278
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,558
Surprised to see me?

279
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,728
Guess Speedy didn't mention
that I'm his new runner.

280
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,522
No, he didn't.

281
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:31,235
Yeah, when he told me you asked
for maple mushrooms, I got nostalgic.

282
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:37,324
What do you say, Jones?
One last trip for old times' sake?

283
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:41,078
- Baby, are those the shrooms we're doing?
- Excuse me, who are you?

284
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,913
I'm his new girlfriend.

285
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,749
Yeah. I'll take it from here.

286
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,042
Thanks.

287
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,462
All right, then.
That'll be 500 for the fungi.

288
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,048
Is there any way you can spot me?

289
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:57,094
Typical, Jones. You have a week.

290
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,638
Or else I'll come looking for you.

291
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,979
Did I miss something?

292
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,149
Clearly, there's no talking
you out of this.

293
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,527
But only this once.

294
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,242
Chadwick, I distinctly remember
making reservations at Fukumomo,

295
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,286
so whatever game you're playing...

296
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,456
Thought this would be more fun.

297
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,252
Like those early days
when we didn't have any furniture.

298
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,963
Chinese food by candlelight.

299
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,132
You said you'd have dinner with me.

300
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,846
Since this might be the last night
I see you, I wanted it to be special.

301
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,057
That's sweet. But you left out the part

302
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,269
where you blackmailed me
into coming with compromising photos.

303
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:51,064
Veronica, please. It's just dinner.

304
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,988
We can talk about the good times too.
It wasn't all bad, was it?

305
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,116
We had our moments.

306
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,331
All right, dinner here is fine,

307
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,251
but only because I haven't had
proper Chinese food in months.

308
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,003
Okay.

309
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,220
Voila.

310
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,805
I cooked the maple mushrooms into a sauce.

311
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,434
Pop's very first psychedelic cheeseburger.

312
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,019
I like it.

313
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
Delicious.

314
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,449
You don't have to stay with me
the whole time,

315
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,618
you can just check in periodically.

316
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,122
Okay. See you later.

317
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,090
Look what I found.

318
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,427
Our first date.

319
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,265
I can't believe you thought
a tour of the London Dungeons

320
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,808
was the way to woo me.

321
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,646
Our wedding song.

322
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,941
The first time we danced
as husband and wife.

323
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,991
Would you do me the honor
of making it our last too?

324
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,759
We've been through so much, Veronica.

325
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,263
I genuinely thought
we'd be together forever.

326
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,641
Chad?

327
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,686
That night...

328
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,897
the night of the accident...

329
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,568
I always wondered...

330
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,282
you didn't crash on purpose, did you?

331
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:13,290
Why would you ever think that?
We almost died.

332
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,252
Because then we'd be together forever...

333
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,047
in a different way.

334
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:31,391
Veronica, all I ever wanted to do was
just make you as happy as you make me.

335
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,564
I signed the papers
right before you walked in.

336
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:43,236
I told you,
I just want one last night together.

337
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,489
Thank you, Chad.

338
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,912
Tonight's making me happy.

339
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,551
Tick, tick,

340
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,304
boom.

341
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,830
If you won't sell them now, maybe
you will after they're burnt to a crisp.

342
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:47,467
And here is where I lead
your shining stars in song.

343
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,427
Kevin is an amazing glee club director.

344
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,263
As a matter of fact...

345
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:57,018
Not to worry, folks.
It's probably just the circuit breaker.

346
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,771
Why don't you wait here
and I'll be right back.

347
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,527
He was in the Army. He's got it.

348
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,658
Juniper, would you mind
getting the door for Grandma?

349
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,161
Were you expecting anyone?

350
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:19,416
No, I may have forgotten
to invite the Blossoms.

351
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,126
Charles.

352
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,757
Hey, Mom. Little sister.

353
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,390
Hi, Betty. Have you missed me?

354
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,316
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to explain what's going on.

355
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:49,321
I've been, uh, visiting Charles in prison
over the years.

356
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,205
They have guns, Mom.

357
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,460
I see that. They're not gonna hurt us.

358
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:07,088
Let's just get through whatever this is.

359
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,555
Why are you here, Charles?

360
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,683
Destiny.
There was an explosion at the prison.

361
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,520
While the other prisoners
headed off for the hills...

362
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,315
We came here,
to celebrate with our family.

363
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:29,527
Chic and I would like to be married,
with our family present.

364
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,113
How? You don't even have a minister.

365
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:39,788
Um, about that, Betty,
Charles had me get ordained online

366
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,666
- so I could marry them in prison.
- But this is so much better.

367
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,543
I mean, at home sweet home.

368
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,312
Watches, wallets, cell phones,
jewelry in the backpack.

369
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,599
Come on, hurry up.

370
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,643
What's going on out there?

371
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,368
Okay, okay, okay.

372
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,331
Drop it.

373
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,969
There's two more by the circuit breaker.
The school's under some attack.

374
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:03,473
Yeah. My dad texted me, said there was
a breakout at Hiram Lodge's prison.

375
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,309
- We need to move out.
- There are 11 civilians in here.

376
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:10,313
We don't know how many armed inmates
are out there. We stay put.

377
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,902
Then we barricade all entrances
and secure all access points.

378
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,946
Kevin, hold down the fort.

379
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,581
In front of these witnesses
and by the power vested in me

380
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,836
by the Universal Life Church,
I now pronounce you husband

381
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,462
and husband.

382
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,839
Juniper, don't get that.

383
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:36,922
Hey.

384
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,927
Glen, what are you doing here?

385
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,390
Glen, as in Glen Scot?

386
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,935
Charles? It can't be.

387
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,521
It is.

388
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,524
Right, you two went
to the Academy together.

389
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,236
Is that why you're writing
your dissertation about us?

390
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,321
- He's doing what?
- He's doing what?

391
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,159
Yeah. Yeah. He's writing a paper
about serial killers.

392
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,703
You know, nature versus nurture.

393
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,330
How it relates to the Cooper family.

394
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,041
What the hell, I don't count?

395
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,543
Of course you do, babe.

396
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,674
Since my old rival from the Academy
is interested in learning

397
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,676
what makes a serial killer tick,

398
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,304
I think we should play a game.

399
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,316
Would you put that gun away?
We're in a high school.

400
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,360
As far as I'm concerned,
we're behind enemy lines, sergeant.

401
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,697
- Hello? Anyone in here?
- Uncle Frank.

402
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,865
Archie, open up.

403
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,661
It's a good thing you told me
about Parents Night.

404
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,747
Kev's dad said there was a prison break.

405
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,918
Maybe not. I overheard inmates saying
they're getting paid to trash the town,

406
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,044
especially this school.

407
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,713
Only Hiram Lodge would be
crazy enough to do that.

408
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,257
He's made us a target, we gotta go.

409
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:11,100
You only have six bullets in that gun.
What are you gonna do when you run out?

410
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,186
The smart play here is to withdraw.

411
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,940
You want us to lead civilians out
into open hostile territory?

412
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,109
I went to this school,
I grew up in this town.

413
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,111
We can slip out through a tunnel.

414
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,364
I can get everyone
to the sheriff's station.

415
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,157
Sounds like a plan, sergeant.

416
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:42,006
So this fun game is called Pincushion Man.

417
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,008
Where the youngest member of a family

418
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,095
takes a pin and sticks it
in the Pincushion Man.

419
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,430
Tonight, that man is Glen.

420
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,016
- No.
- And if memory serves,

421
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,020
Juniper is the youngest member
of our family by three minutes?

422
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,817
Here's your pin, little lady.

423
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,905
All you have to do is stick it
in the Pincushion Man, nice and deep.

424
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:15,206
Please, please, Charles, I'm begging you.
She's 9 years old, okay?

425
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,168
This will scar her
for the rest of her life.

426
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:23,965
Me and you, we're lost causes,
there's no hope for us.

427
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,094
But there's still hope
for them, okay? Please.

428
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,555
Please let there be hope for the twins.

429
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,641
Please.

430
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
You're right.

431
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,528
Juniper doesn't need
to lose her innocence tonight.

432
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,907
That means you have to take her turn.

433
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,119
One round of Pincushion Man...

434
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,664
then we'll get back to the wedding.

435
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,126
And then we'll be gone in the dark.

436
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,170
Fine.

437
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,303
Juniper, Dagwood, get upstairs.

438
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,143
Please don't do this.

439
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,646
I don't have a choice.

440
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,066
Trust me.

441
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,569
Rot in hell, Glen.

442
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,405
I can't believe she did it.

443
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,120
Mom.

444
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,918
Mom?

445
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,841
Glen.

446
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,803
We need to get him
to a hospital right now.

447
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,430
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

448
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,975
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, no!

449
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,024
Jughead?

450
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:09,278
Tabitha. Oh, you're here.
Oh, my God, it's my muse.

451
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,072
Guess the shrooms kicked in, huh?

452
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,159
Shouldn't you be writing?

453
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,162
I've already completed it. The first part.

454
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,081
Who cares? Will you just dance with me?

455
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:24,502
- You have no idea what you're missing...
- I'm good, thanks.

456
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,296
- Don't be such a Betty.
- A what?

457
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,674
First sign of fun, you try to kill it.

458
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:35,054
Yep. Okay. Time for my contingency plan.

459
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,265
Bondage. Nice.

460
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,935
I'm sorry, but this is for your own good.

461
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,188
You have to get some real writing done.
I'll be back in the morning.

462
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,357
Wait, you're not serious, are you?

463
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,444
- Write. Write.
- Tabitha. Tabitha.

464
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,695
Tabitha, don't!

465
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,370
I can help you
out of this jam, baby.

466
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,081
Jess?

467
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,333
Oh, I knew you'd come back.

468
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:09,297
Of course.
Now calm down and let's get lit.

469
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,758
I'm in the mood to fool around.

470
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,343
I wish I could, but...

471
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,347
That won't be a problem.

472
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,265
Betty?

473
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,562
Shh. It's okay, Jug. I'm here now.

474
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,191
It was really awful what I did to you
senior year, wasn't it?

475
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,572
Can you ever forgive me?

476
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,534
Yeah. Yeah, I can forgive you.

477
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,864
It was really awful what I did to you
senior year, wasn't it?

478
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,492
Archie and I kissed...

479
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,623
I can help you
out of this jam, baby.

480
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,510
Mumzie?

481
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,847
- What are you doing here?
- Nightmare child,

482
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,183
I've escaped that hideous prison,
and praise God I did.

483
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,602
Flames are encroaching upon Thornhill.

484
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,312
Quickly, to the window.

485
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,275
Our groves...

486
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,568
The curse.

487
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:59,031
The curse of our ancestors demands
that all living Blossoms must die.

488
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,826
Unless...

489
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,036
Unless?

490
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,915
We sacrifice the interloper.

491
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:13,963
Oh, hell, no.

492
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,631
No, Min-Min, wait!

493
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,259
There's no time to give chase.
We must pray.

494
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,427
Pray for what?

495
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,471
We must pray for wind, to divert the fire.

496
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,702
What the hell?

497
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,996
You lied to me, Chad.

498
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,079
I can explain.

499
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:52,752
You told me you signed the divorce papers.
All that talk about not wanting to fight

500
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,545
- about closure?
- Hear me out.

501
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,549
Over the past year, I got involved
in an investment scheme.

502
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,969
It was supposed to be a sure thing,
an easy way to get us out of debt.

503
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,304
What debt?

504
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,390
I made some bad investments,
but I figured out a way to get us out.

505
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,518
It just meant borrowing
from other investors.

506
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,313
Tell me you didn't.

507
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,524
I had to make the investments
in the name of an existing company.

508
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,319
So I used your new jewelry store,
La Petite Bijoutière.

509
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,279
This is unbelievable.

510
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,449
You need to sign
those damn divorce papers right now.

511
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,493
Why would you want me to do that?

512
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:31,540
If we divorce,
I can testify against you in court.

513
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,504
No one would believe
that the She-Wolf of Wall Street

514
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:40,216
didn't know about the dirty dealings
going on in her business.

515
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,551
Don't worry, babe.

516
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,390
I'll make it all back. I just need time...

517
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,685
and a little help from you.

518
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,859
Sergeant, you have something
to discuss with me?

519
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,111
I do, sir.

520
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:06,033
I won't be accepting your commendation.
If I'd trusted my instincts

521
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,161
over your orders,
my men might still be alive.

522
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,876
And I know there's
some sort of cover-up going on.

523
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,629
I wanna make you a hero, Andrews.

524
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,925
But if you're not gonna play ball,
then I'll make you the scapegoat.

525
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:27,555
You have a choice,
dutiful soldier or traitor.

526
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,598
I'm at peace with my decision.

527
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,145
And if you do force me
to take the stand, I'll speak my truth.

528
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,228
Yes.

529
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,190
And we'll see who Washington believes.

530
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,851
"The Transubstantiation"?

531
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,117
Hey, how are you guys doing?

532
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,162
Uncle Frank's gonna lay low
here for a bit.

533
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,956
My mom will talk to the parole board
about how he helped us.

534
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,918
Yeah, fingers crossed
Mary Andrews comes through.

535
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,095
Hey, you on the train yet?

536
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,390
Archie, I'm staying in New York.

537
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,266
Why?

538
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,437
I have some business things to sort out.

539
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,607
I'll explain everything when I get back.

540
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,527
Ronnie, don't do this.

541
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,613
I have to. Just for a few days.

542
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,117
Fine. Have fun.

543
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,163
Thornhill didn't burn

544
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:20,209
because of that freak windstorm
but a lot of the groves did.

545
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,586
Cheryl will be begging us
to buy them from her now.

546
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:27,758
And the way my inmates left
Riverdale High, it won't reopen for weeks,

547
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,468
if ever.

548
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,346
You've done well, Reggie.

549
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:37,393
And today, today's a good day.

550
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,857
Okay, thanks for letting me know.

551
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,482
Bye.

552
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,487
That was Glen. He's okay.

553
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,532
Just a flesh wound, like I intended.

554
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,869
And Charles is still in the ICU
at Shankshaw,

555
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,580
but it seems like he's gonna make it.

556
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,167
There is something else though, Mom.

557
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:07,047
Um, the FBI has decided to...

558
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,385
relocate the Lonely Highway case upstate,

559
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,847
closer to their northern office in Derry.

560
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,766
But I'm not going
to stop looking for Polly, Mom.

561
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,395
As Glen so helpfully reminded me,

562
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,899
I do have an instinct for these things.

563
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,526
I will get justice, Mom.

564
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,791
Jughead, I brought you food...

565
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,888
Oh, my God.
