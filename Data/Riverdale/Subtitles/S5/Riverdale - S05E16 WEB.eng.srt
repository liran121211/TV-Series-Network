1
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:13,930
Our old-pal-turned-superstar,
Josie McCoy, had come and gone.

2
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,434
Leaving us all to our haunted existences.

3
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,770
No one more so than Archie Andrews.

4
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,232
The guilt over the deaths
of his platoon members

5
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,359
hanging on him like a shroud.

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,030
Veronica Lodge was also being haunted

7
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,033
but by a flesh-and-blood mistake
from her past.

8
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,537
What, Chad?

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,289
I have some great news.

10
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,001
I'm gonna be able to pay back
the funds I borrowed in one fell swoop.

11
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,212
I've been working on a little
something-something quietly,

12
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,924
but it's about to go public,
and with that comes a big payday.

13
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,595
Considering you always
screw things up?

14
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,222
No, Chad. I don't want or need your help.

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,808
At the rate Pearls and Posh is going,

16
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,311
I'll have our investors' accounts
restored in a month.

17
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,773
At which point, I'll divorce your ass
so fast, your head will spin.

18
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,690
Goodbye, Chad.

19
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:12,155
Brothers and sisters,
thank you for joining us today.

20
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,617
To conclude, Brother Kevin and I
will be performing a medley

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,580
from the iconic musical Joseph
and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.

22
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,834
Stop.

23
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,755
I have just had a revelation.

24
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,838
Okay.

25
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,885
Jason himself commands it.

26
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,179
No more singing.

27
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,263
Really?

28
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,936
As you know,
he was a young man of few words.

29
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,193
Hi, uh, my name is Jughead Jones,

30
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,237
and I am seven days sober.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,988
- All right.
- Good job, man.

32
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,033
I think I'm ready
to start my apology tour.

33
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,040
- Hey, Alice.
- Hey, Jughead.

34
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,752
Uh, Betty's not here.

35
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:12,924
She's, um, working the Lonely Highway,
doing God knows what.

36
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,141
That's okay.

37
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,601
- Will you tell her I stopped by?
- Sure.

38
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,360
You guys seen this crap?
The front page of today's Brave and True.

39
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,530
General Taylor is retiring
with full honors

40
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,532
and a 21-gun farewell salute.

41
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,784
Doesn't that burn you
after the crap he pulled?

42
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,787
- You said Taylor was under investigation.
- He was.

43
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,499
A reporter was looking
into some dirty missions

44
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,877
the general orchestrated, like ours, Eric.

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,255
I called her. Her editor killed the story.
Not enough evidence, she said.

46
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,551
Maybe take that as a sign, sarge.
Let it go. Move on.

47
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,177
Like hell.

48
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,643
You've missed weeks of work.

49
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,770
You didn't even arrange for a substitute.

50
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,522
I know. I'm sorry, Waldo.

51
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,732
I really am. I...

52
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,819
I was going through
some intense personal stuff.

53
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,406
I'm trying to get my life back together.

54
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,367
When you do,
maybe we can have you teach again.

55
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,871
But right now,
you're on administrative leave.

56
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,504
Pearls and Posh, this is Lodge.

57
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,091
Ms. Lodge, this is Diane Nelson.
I'm an agent with the SEC.

58
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,637
We'd like to schedule a time to come in
and review your books and finances.

59
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,013
Oh, why is that?

60
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,475
To ensure that Pearls and Posh is not
engaged in any financial malfeasance.

61
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,143
- Can we plan on tomorrow?
- Uh...

62
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,939
Ooh, I'm traveling tomorrow.

63
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,732
Can we try top of next week?

64
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,317
Sure. Top of next week is good.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,985
I'll follow up with an e-mail.

66
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,278
Great. See you then.

67
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:07,413
The SEC wants to look at our books,
which are not yet kosher.

68
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,459
Yes. It had to have been Chad
who tipped them off.

69
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,795
Wouldn't he be torpedoing himself too?

70
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,048
What he wants is for me
to ask for his help,

71
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,009
so he can balance our books
before the SEC reviews them.

72
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,262
I'd rather go to white-collar jail
than do that.

73
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,181
What we need is an influx of cash.

74
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,185
- My mind turns to...
- my father.

75
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,604
What? Like a short-term loan?

76
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,606
Remember those escaped prisoners

77
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,109
who were convinced
my father had a stash of palladium?

78
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,236
If we got our hands on that,

79
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,529
we could sell it,

80
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,156
and finish repaying
what Chad stole in my name.

81
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,201
If it was in his safe,
he would've moved it, but...

82
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,454
I have an idea who might know where.

83
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,292
Your old man's been in touch with Hermosa.

84
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,003
She's still in deep with him.

85
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,964
- I'll call her.
- Actually, uh...

86
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,174
Let me.

87
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,219
While you were at Barnard...

88
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:09,392
we had a thing.

89
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,645
- What kind of thing?
- You... You know what kind.

90
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,024
You know what kind. Okay.

91
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,778
Hey, baby.

92
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,405
Long time no talk.

93
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,198
Yeah.

94
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,950
I miss you so much.

95
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,456
Why does my demon of a mother
always have to rain on my parade?

96
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,459
You're young, beautiful and a star.
And she isn't.

97
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,130
Which is why you need to prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt

98
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:43,468
that there is no higher authority than you
within this ministry.

99
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,635
You're not wrong.

100
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:49,098
So how do we put Mumzie
in the shade forever?

101
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,145
It's all about showmanship, Cheryl.
You need to upstage your mother.

102
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,814
Little-known fact:

103
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,944
If you perform three miracles,
you qualify for sainthood.

104
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,699
Being canonized has always been
one of my life goals. Go on.

105
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,911
In junior high,
I was obsessed with David Copperfield.

106
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,580
The magician. So...

107
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,583
I may have a trick or two up my sleeve.

108
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,420
Oh, I hope
you have at least three, Brother Kevin.

109
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,632
I need my halo and my wings.

110
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,426
That was some call, Reggie.

111
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,303
How's Hermosa doing?

112
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,389
A better question:

113
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,851
Did she just tell me
where the palladium is?

114
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,853
The answer is yes.

115
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,986
You're carrying a heavy weight, Archie.

116
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,367
It's not gonna get lighter
unless you share the burden, so...

117
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,829
What happened over there?
Ready to tell me?

118
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,759
We were ordered into a fire zone
to deliver medical supplies to civilians.

119
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,137
But that mission was just a cover-up.

120
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,808
General Taylor was determined to take down
a warlord controlling that region.

121
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,811
A chance to get that final star
on his uniform.

122
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:20,106
When he gave me the order, I pushed back.

123
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:25,653
I told him we weren't a strike force
and that it was a suicide mission.

124
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,531
Taylor didn't back down, so I... I caved.

125
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:34,245
And we were lambs to the slaughter.
My platoon got caught in some trenches.

126
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,747
We needed air support.

127
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,207
We couldn't get any signal.

128
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,003
Someone needed to reach higher ground,
so I told my men that I would go.

129
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,590
I thought I was protecting them
because I was taking the risk.

130
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,843
And when I got back...

131
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,100
...everyone was dead.

132
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,689
Aiden? Aiden?

133
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,485
Except Bingo.

134
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,200
Who died before the choppers reached us
and Eric, who lost his leg.

135
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,869
And now Taylor is walking away
with honors.

136
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,705
That's not right.

137
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,504
- That's not right, Uncle Frank.
- I know it's not.

138
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,382
But the Army's just gonna
circle the wagons around the general.

139
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,968
I wish I could tell you
this is a war you could win.

140
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,639
- But I don't know that it is.
- Maybe not.

141
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,352
But it's a war worth fighting.

142
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:44,732
And I'm gonna do everything that I can
to take Taylor down.

143
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:56,202
Lucky your father didn't change
all the security codes after he fired me.

144
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,330
Lucky that he doesn't keep
his palladium in a bank.

145
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,592
Jackpot.

146
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,891
We have to give Hermosa
a cut of whatever we make.

147
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,186
But if we can sell
the palladium off-market,

148
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,855
our profits should be enough
to fill in where we're short.

149
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,983
Question is, how do we sell it?

150
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,986
Well, first,
we'd have to smelt the palladium

151
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,822
down into something new
and unrecognizable.

152
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,740
I'm thinking Spanish doubloons.

153
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,077
Then I'll host an auction,
but for that to work...

154
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,248
there's one more person
we need to bring in.

155
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,166
What do you think?

156
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,004
I think that one can never have
too many spider brooches.

157
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,840
- So, yes, I'll help you, Veronica.
- Perfect.

158
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:56,470
As I said, I'm hosting
an exclusive by-invitation-only auction.

159
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,890
The centerpiece of which will be
some palladium doubloons I've acquired.

160
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,311
My guests have been asking
about the palladium's origins,

161
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,563
and I wanna say
that it came from your mines.

162
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,441
Not a problem. I'm always happy
to let you name-drop my family

163
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,151
in order to screw over your father.

164
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,195
Now, if that's all,
I'll be on my merry way.

165
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,448
Kevin and I are performing
our first miracle.

166
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,583
- Hey, Samm.
- Finally!

167
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,251
You've been ducking my calls.

168
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,171
- Yeah, no, sorry. I've been...
- Save your excuses.

169
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,174
The publisher is demanding
a manuscript ASAP.

170
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,385
If you don't deliver,
you will be blackballed.

171
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,888
Your career will be over. Over!

172
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,350
I have pages. I'll send them to you
by the end of the day.

173
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,186
This is your last chance, kiddo. Okay?

174
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,479
Don't disappoint me.

175
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,155
Hey, so...

176
00:10:56,238 --> 00:11:00,159
Before you say anything else,
I just... I wanna apologize.

177
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,371
I promised to keep an eye on you
while you were tripping,

178
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,956
and the moment things got weird, I just...

179
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,085
- I abandoned you.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

180
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,838
I never should have even put you
in that position.

181
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,882
And I'm sorry.

182
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,469
I'm so sorry
I dropped off the face of the earth.

183
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:22,056
And that I made you worry.
I'm sorry for everything, really.

184
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,724
It's okay.

185
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,601
I forgive you.

186
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,979
Great. So...

187
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,359
not to relive that horrible night,

188
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,447
but I dimly recall writing something

189
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,867
that resembled a novel before I yanked
my hand out of the handcuffs.

190
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,537
Jughead, you did write
your book that night.

191
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,539
I did? Okay, well, that's great.

192
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,499
- You know where it is?
- Yeah, um...

193
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,378
Betty gave it to Jessica

194
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,213
when she asked for it.

195
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,007
Wh...

196
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,053
Why would Betty...? Why would she do that?

197
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,306
Jess was trying to heal
and move on with her life,

198
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,435
so it seemed like
the right thing to do at the time.

199
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,438
- Wow, okay.
- I'm really, really sorry.

200
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,733
But, Jughead, your sobriety is
what's most important right now.

201
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,070
I don't think you should reach out
to Jessica. That could be triggering.

202
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,489
And if writing is gonna stress you out,

203
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,659
then maybe ask your agent
for another extension.

204
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,328
I don't have any more time, Tabitha.

205
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:31,208
I either write something new,
or I am not a writer anymore.

206
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,418
If I ever was.

207
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,671
Instead of my usual homily,

208
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,215
I thought today we might all benefit

209
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:43,971
from a demonstration
of my absolute authority in this ministry.

210
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:49,435
To that end,
as Jesus once changed water into wine...

211
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,565
Jason has granted me

212
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:59,069
the ability to turn water into...

213
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,491
maple syrup.

214
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,041
The nectar of the gods.

215
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,042
Truly.

216
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,257
- General Taylor.
- Sergeant Andrews.

217
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,469
I take it you're not here
to congratulate me.

218
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,180
No, sir. We both know the truth, general.

219
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:31,310
You sent me and my men into a war zone
without adequate support or intel.

220
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,729
Because of your recklessness,
good men died.

221
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,316
You're dishonoring the military
by pretending to be some kind of hero.

222
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,399
So...

223
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:45,282
I'm asking you, soldier to soldier,
to stand down and retire quietly.

224
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,826
"Soldier to soldier"?

225
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:53,290
You're just a kid from some Podunk town
who joined the military on a whim.

226
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,502
You might as well have gone
backpacking through Europe.

227
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,879
You don't understand the Army
or how it works,

228
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:03,050
and you certainly don't know
what it means to be a real soldier.

229
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,095
Don't cross me. You will regret it.

230
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:11,058
My men paid for your order with blood.

231
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,063
If you don't step down, general,
I'll demand a military tribunal.

232
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,982
I'll tell them everything.

233
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,402
Then I'll be forced
to put forth my version of events.

234
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,906
Highlighting how you,
Sergeant Andrews, went rogue

235
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,784
and led your platoon directly
into an ambush.

236
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,579
There's no paper trail
to support your claim.

237
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,999
So, as I said before,

238
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,334
it's my word against yours.

239
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,714
Pursue this and you'll be a traitor.

240
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,797
No.

241
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,389
You're the traitor, general.
I buried good men because of you.

242
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,474
I won't bury the truth any longer.

243
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,936
Regardless of the consequences.

244
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,441
Taylor left us no choice.

245
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,152
He won't back down,
so we need to take him out.

246
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,820
I don't know, sarge.

247
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,698
A trial would reopen wounds,

248
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,284
especially for the families
of those other guys.

249
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,537
We have to think about them
and what they would want us to do.

250
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,172
So let's say this,
I won't go after the general

251
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,508
unless I have the support and the approval
of our platoon's families.

252
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,594
How does that sound?

253
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,774
Would you mind reading my novel?

254
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,985
If you like it,
maybe you could give it to your agent?

255
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,390
My son trusted you
and you didn't protect him.

256
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,686
And now you expect us
to go through a trial

257
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,605
to relive his death all over again.

258
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,901
Ma'am, I know what Travis stood for,
what he believed in.

259
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,071
He fought for ideals
like truth and justice,

260
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,448
for betterment and human dignity.

261
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,036
He sacrificed his life for those things.

262
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,166
Let me ask you,
do you sleep soundly at night, sergeant?

263
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,418
Because I don't.

264
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,586
Not since the moment...

265
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,881
I received that folded-up flag.

266
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,844
Know why? Because you were supposed
to bring my Travis back to me.

267
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,432
Now, for the main event,

268
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,811
a collection of doubloons
smelted from grade-A palladium,

269
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,855
excavated from the Blossom mines.

270
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:09,111
With that in mind, let's begin at 150,000
to the gentleman in the fedora.

271
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:13,198
Do I have 170? One hundred seventy.
Nope. One hundred eighty.

272
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:17,411
No, 190,000 to the madam
in the front row. Shall we go to two?

273
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,205
Two hundred thousand to Mr. Sand.
Do I have 225?

274
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,374
Do I have 250?

275
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,334
Two fifty. Two seventy-five.

276
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,338
Two ninety against you, Mr. Sand.
Three hundred thousand.

277
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,383
That's $300,000
for these precious doubloons.

278
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,761
Going once. Going twice.

279
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,556
Sold to Mr. Sand for $300,000.

280
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,352
What a coup for such rare wonders.

281
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,733
Excuse me.

282
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:55,157
It's almost as if you wanted to sell
those doubloons to Mr. Sand for less,

283
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,117
so I wouldn't get the palladium.

284
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,704
But that would be so petty
and ridiculous of you, wouldn't it?

285
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,502
In fact, that's exactly what I did, Daddy.
Next time, don't crash my auction.

286
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,177
I never wanted Jim to join the Army.

287
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,056
I was afraid he wouldn't even make it
through basic training,

288
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:23,519
but he really believed that he had a duty
to protect and serve his country.

289
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,021
That there was no greater honor than that.

290
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,648
There isn't. No.

291
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,150
Jim knew what he was fighting for.

292
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,197
I remember I was incredibly relieved

293
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,201
when he started
sending me letters about you.

294
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,163
About the kind of leader you were. So yes.

295
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,376
Whatever you feel is right, you should do.

296
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,254
You have my full support.

297
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,721
You've already witnessed
one miracle.

298
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:04,852
Now, brothers and sisters, watch in wonder

299
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:09,773
as Cheryl manifests the collective pain
of our congregation.

300
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,110
Behold her alabaster hands,

301
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:17,447
how they bleed
with the blood of the stigmata.

302
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,950
Mimicking the holy wounds of Jason!

303
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,880
Ma'am?

304
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,261
I'd like to honor your husband's memory
by having General Taylor answer

305
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,596
for his actions.

306
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,931
But I'd like to do so with your consent.

307
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:48,520
To be honest, I've made peace
with what happened, Sergeant Andrews.

308
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,564
I loved Aiden more than anything.

309
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,441
We were high-school sweethearts, but...

310
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,903
my son is my focus now.

311
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,239
I need to start thinking about his future.

312
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,827
I'm trying to make it through the day
and even that's a struggle.

313
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,413
So I leave it to you, sergeant.

314
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,751
Ma'am.

315
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,962
You do what you see fit.

316
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,434
Who knew spreading light and love
could be this exhausting?

317
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,519
Yeah, it's the Broadway grind.

318
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,022
I got a list of potential third miracles,

319
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,859
although my strong preference is
that we do the staff and the snake trick.

320
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,583
Those snakes are unquestionably biblical,

321
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,613
I already know
what I want my third miracle to be.

322
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,492
Do you remember when I got revenge
on Mr. Honey years ago?

323
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,619
When he tried to ban
my back-to-school party?

324
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:49,957
Yeah. But, Cheryl,
bees are not in my repertoire.

325
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,792
I'm highly allergic.

326
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:56,129
Fear not, Kev. As a girl,
Nana Rose was an avid beekeeper.

327
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,340
She taught me all her apian secrets.

328
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:01,968
Okay.

329
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,577
- What do you want, Chadwick?
- I just got wind of your auction.

330
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,688
It pains me
to see you so desperate for funds.

331
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,439
So I'm double-checking.

332
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,526
Are you sure you don't want in
on my amazing deal?

333
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,404
Surely you've heard of CopterCab.

334
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:25,659
The helicopter taxis that fly 1 percenters
to Marcia's Vineyard for private parties?

335
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,369
- That's you?
- It is.

336
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,746
I'm more of a silent partner.

337
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,332
So do you want in or not?

338
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,543
Your father's also working with me.

339
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,838
I killed it at my auction.

340
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:41,508
So much so that all of
your swindled investors are paid in full.

341
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,385
Just in time for the SEC.

342
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,468
So, no,

343
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,764
I don't want in on your little scheme.

344
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:53,145
Well, listen, CopterCab's going public,
and we're celebrating at your father's HQ.

345
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,189
Why don't you come by,
blow off some steam?

346
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,775
You know what? I might just do that.

347
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,570
- Text me the deets, will you?
- Happy to.

348
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,447
And we'll toast to the future.

349
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,865
Looking forward to it.

350
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,533
Goodbye, Chadwick.

351
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,537
You're partying with that smug nitwit?
What am I missing?

352
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,997
Me, Reggie.

353
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,832
You're missing the old me.

354
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,420
I've been playing defense,
reacting to Chad's every move.

355
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,798
Well, now that I don't have
to worry about the SEC,

356
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,843
it's time I go on the offensive
and take Chad Gekko

357
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,345
off the chessboard of my life
once and for all.

358
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,100
And if Daddy gets caught
in my crosshairs, so be it.

359
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,407
Damn. It's good.

360
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,544
Hey, Jones.

361
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,255
Hey, I finished the novel.

362
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,466
Not a chapter, not a draft,

363
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,301
I mean, the whole thing.

364
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:11,473
It is about a budding young writer at NYU

365
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,895
just making their way through the world,
having a lot of sex and partying.

366
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,188
Sounds terrific.

367
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,648
Send it to me ASAP.

368
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,731
Yeah, okay.

369
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,860
Keep an eye out for it.

370
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,772
You're really
going through with this?

371
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,442
Telling our business
to a military tribunal?

372
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:49,946
There's no easy path through this, Eric.
So I'm doing what feels most right.

373
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,116
Going on behalf of myself
and the families that want me to advocate

374
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,869
for their brothers,
their sons, their fathers.

375
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,788
- I hope you'll go with me.
- You don't understand.

376
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:06,504
You weren't the only grunt Taylor brought
into his tent because of that mission.

377
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,135
He said it was gonna be
our moment of glory

378
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,804
and that there'd be
a big promotion in it for me.

379
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,850
All I had to do was
what I was trained to as a sniper.

380
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,729
Find a clear line of fire
and take out that warlord.

381
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,439
In our briefing, General Taylor said

382
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:27,442
our target was the only thing
that mattered.

383
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,529
But my platoon's safety
should have been my top priority.

384
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,368
We were vulnerable. And I knew it.

385
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:40,580
And when you went in to call for support,
I left our unit unprotected

386
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,624
to carry out Taylor's orders.

387
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,963
And I gotta tell you, sarge,

388
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,924
part of me thinks that
that's why I lost my leg.

389
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,469
As punishment
for how I betrayed you and the others.

390
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:59,307
No, you didn't do anything wrong.
I'll keep you out of it, Eric. I swear.

391
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,310
You were used
by the general the same way I was.

392
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:07,023
But you're done fighting, corporal.
Let me bring this home for you.

393
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,068
It'd be my honor.

394
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,869
Behold Cheryl Blossom
as she prepares her third

395
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,621
and final miracle,

396
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,082
the taming of the bees.

397
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:28,628
Witness as her purity keeps
her porcelain skin safe

398
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:33,174
- from these vicious, spiteful creatures.
- This is nothing but a farce.

399
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,970
I pray ye,
do not fall victim to her deceit.

400
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:40,265
For if ye do, this ministry shall
become nothing but a sham.

401
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,685
Brothers and sisters,
we find ourselves at a crossroads.

402
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,188
- Allow me to be your guide.
- Do not listen to this heretic.

403
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,898
Who are you going to put your faith in?

404
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:53,111
Cheryl, who shared the womb
with Jason the Divine?

405
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:57,240
Or her mother, a whoremonger,
an escaped convict?

406
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,825
Lies. Lies, all of it!

407
00:26:58,908 --> 00:26:59,909
Mother, enough!

408
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,455
Begone from my temple...

409
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,499
or I will smite thee.

410
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,545
For I am Cheryl Blossom,

411
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,589
Queen of the Bees.

412
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,271
You look ready for action.

413
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,358
I feel like I'm about to be walking
into a firing squad.

414
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,319
Taylor should be worried.
You tell the tribunal the truth.

415
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,446
And I'll be there to back you up.

416
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,365
Eric.

417
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,411
You don't have to do this.

418
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,375
I couldn't sleep, thinking I left
my brothers high and dry once.

419
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,211
I won't desert you again.

420
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,382
I wanna testify.
Don't even try to talk me out of it.

421
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,465
Wouldn't dream of it.

422
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,724
Boys, we did it.

423
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,144
In one hour, CopterCab will be
the publicly-traded future

424
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,022
of aero-entertainment
and we will be richer men.

425
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,106
Cheers.

426
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,318
Amen to that.

427
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,361
Veronica.

428
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,240
- What is this?
- Oh, Chadwick.

429
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,660
If you're gonna be one of the big boys,
you need to party like a big boy.

430
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,703
Isn't that right, Daddy?

431
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:30,417
So I invited some good-time girls.
I hope that's all right.

432
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:38,383
Differences aside, CopterCab is
a brilliant business idea, Chad.

433
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,262
And for the first time in a long time,
you've impressed me.

434
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,892
But for now, who wants some bubbly?

435
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,354
Cheers.

436
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,949
Uh, your mom tells me you're working
on the Lonely Highway?

437
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,412
Yeah. By dressing like Polly
and pretending to be a hitchhiker.

438
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,495
Is that safe?

439
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,584
Probably not,
but I'm running out of ideas, so...

440
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,628
What'd you wanna talk about?

441
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:29,225
I wanted to apologize, actually,
for that voicemail that I left you.

442
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,270
I don't remember all of it or...

443
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,231
even most of it.

444
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,818
But I know it was horrible.

445
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,319
And, uh...

446
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,825
Just... I'm sorry.

447
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,624
Why now after half a decade?

448
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,043
It's one of my steps.

449
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,172
Trying to clean up
my side of the track and I...

450
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,093
I'm in recovery, in case it's not obvious.

451
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,389
I'm an alcoholic.

452
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,685
An addict.

453
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,938
I think I'm an addict too.

454
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,982
Maybe a better word is "compulsive."

455
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,319
Because I can't stop hunting
for the trucker killer.

456
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:25,865
I'm on the highway 24/7
when I should be at home with my mom.

457
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,953
- Yeah, but your sister's missing.
- No, it's not that. It's, um...

458
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,207
It's more than that.
And it's sort of been...

459
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,001
my MO lately.

460
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,087
- What do you mean?
- Even when I was at Yale,

461
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,258
I was trying to be a normal... freshman.

462
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,720
Go on dates, make friends,
do extracurriculars.

463
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,639
But it just all felt so...

464
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,183
empty.

465
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,936
Classic Cooper.

466
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,526
You solved eight mysteries in high school
and you were still valedictorian.

467
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,445
But the void
I was so desperately trying to fill

468
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,781
didn't go away when I got to Quantico.

469
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,492
Which is when I...

470
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,912
really realized that...

471
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,209
I am more comfortable...

472
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:24,549
studying serial killers
than I am socializing with normal people.

473
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,801
And, um...

474
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,053
And then I read about TBK.

475
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,722
Trash Bag Killer.

476
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,805
That was, uh...

477
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,100
That was a nasty piece of work.

478
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,895
That's why I wasn't
at your book release party.

479
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,148
I wanted to go, but, um...

480
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,068
I got the offer that night
and I had to choose, you...

481
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,071
or the TBK task force.

482
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,781
That's all ancient history.

483
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,628
I'm consumed by them.

484
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,466
TBK and the trucker killer.

485
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,550
Betty, I think...

486
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:14,307
I think you should probably take a break
from all that, you know?

487
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,393
- Maybe stop hunting for a bit.
- I don't think I can.

488
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,149
I'm sorry. Can I...?

489
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,859
Just real quick.

490
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,614
- Hey, Samm.
- I just finished your book.

491
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,825
It's incredible!

492
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,827
Best thing you've ever written by far.

493
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,205
Uh, I can't do this, Samm.

494
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,042
I didn't write that book.

495
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,879
A grad student named Cora
gave it to me to read.

496
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,632
Wait. What are you saying to me right now?

497
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,134
- That there's no novel?
- Not even a wisp.

498
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,849
And a plagiarist to boot.

499
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:01,062
Listen, I know you got some life things
going on right now, but, um...

500
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,818
- I'm gonna have to drop you as a client.
- Yeah. I figured as much.

501
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:10,488
You're a good writer, kid.
I hope you can pull it together.

502
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,533
Hey, um, I'll send you Cora's info.

503
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,953
I'm sure she'll be thrilled
to hear from you.

504
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,080
Okay.

505
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,545
Sorry, that was...

506
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:35,096
You really struck a gold mine here.
I should have never doubted you.

507
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,726
- I don't know what I was thinking.
- You weren't. But that's okay.

508
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,646
'Cause you're here now
for probably my finest hour.

509
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,109
Gekko, we have a problem.
My Boysenberry's blowing up.

510
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,872
Something's wrong
with the CopterCab stock.

511
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:50,902
It's crashing.

512
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,490
- It's in free fall.
- What the hell is going on?

513
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,118
Were you in a helicopter crash
that you paid to cover up?

514
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,246
The Wall Beat Journal just published
an article about it.

515
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:03,958
You can't be a part of CopterCab
if you crashed a helicopter.

516
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,626
It's a bad look, yes.

517
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,088
Which is why you were a silent partner.

518
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,259
What did you do?

519
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:16,054
Planted the story with a reporter friend,

520
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,973
then came here
to distract you and your entourage

521
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,392
while CopterCab went down in flames.

522
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,645
- Veronica, you little...
- I'm gonna stop you right there, Chad.

523
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:29,692
Because whatever you think I am
doesn't come close to what you are,

524
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,651
which is scum.

525
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,279
A worthless, pathetic, little worm.

526
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,950
You stole money from your investors
to what, finance CopterCab?

527
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,370
But what a surprise.
In the end, you couldn't pull it off.

528
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,624
That's your problem
in a nutshell.

529
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,085
You can't land anything.

530
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,130
You'll never be an alpha, Chad.

531
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,174
You're a born beta.

532
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,385
And everybody who invested in this scheme,

533
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,222
you backed a losing horse, boys.

534
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:02,266
- You too, Daddy.
- Oh, please, mija.

535
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,977
I only invested a modest sum in CopterCab.

536
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,815
You may have destroyed
these clowns... but not me.

537
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,360
Oh, Daddykins.
You're in for a rude awakening.

538
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:17,490
Later, when you're alone,
give your SoDale model another look-see.

539
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,161
I think you'll find that you've lost
much more than you realize.

540
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,166
Come on, ladies. Let's get out of here.

541
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,960
This party's over.

542
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,298
Hey, Jughead.

543
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,594
You okay? I just mentioned "free food"
and you didn't salivate.

544
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,762
Yeah, um...

545
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,808
- I'm just worried about Betty, you know?
- Yeah.

546
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,768
I can imagine.

547
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,149
But I'm also... worried about you.

548
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,733
And your recovery.

549
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,279
I smelled booze on your breath
when you came in.

550
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,325
Yeah, I had a backslide.

551
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:06,330
Jughead, I know that you wanna help Betty,
but you need to focus on you.

552
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,416
She's out there alone.

553
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:12,086
I'm sure, but don't worry about Betty.
I'll take care of her.

554
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,797
Your priority is you.

555
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:16,882
Okay?

556
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,598
You know I'm a drunk, right?

557
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,683
And I'm a terrible busboy.

558
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:29,270
- Why are you so nice to me?
- Because you're my friend.

559
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,732
And I care about you.

560
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,697
So will you promise me
that you'll keep going to your meetings?

561
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,413
Yeah. Yes. Yes, I promise.

562
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,497
Good.

563
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,794
So tell me, what's going on with Betty?

564
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,075
Oh, no, no, no.

565
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,119
No, no, no.

566
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,707
Hello?

567
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,087
Yeah, this is Archie Andrews.

568
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,176
Okay.

569
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,016
Understood. Thank you so much. Bye.

570
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,022
That was the JAG officer with the verdict.

571
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,482
Hurry up before I hurl.

572
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,820
"The tribunal has determined
that Corporal Eric Jackson

573
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,322
was following
the direct and explicit orders

574
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,617
of his commanding officer,
and therefore, is not guilty

575
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,162
of any wrongdoing and remains
in good standing with the U.S. Army."

576
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,914
What about General Taylor?

577
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,792
His actions were determined
to be reckless and of poor judgment.

578
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,671
He was driven by his own self-interest,
and therefore, he is being discharged

579
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:19,755
without honors.

580
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:24,969
- The Army got it right.
- So... it's over?

581
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,761
It's over.

582
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,881
- Tabitha.
- Jughead told me what you're doing.

583
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,592
And it's dangerous and it's reckless,

584
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,471
and no matter what I say,
you're not gonna stop, I know that.

585
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,430
So...

586
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,435
- I'm going with you.
- Come again?

587
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,355
I'm getting changed
and I'm going with you.

588
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:22,068
Oh, and by the way,
my participation is not negotiable.

589
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,114
You boys did it.

590
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,950
You should be proud.

591
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,289
I am. Proud to have served
with the bravest men that I've ever known.

592
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,586
Here's to our fallen band of brothers.

593
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,424
To their service...

594
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,551
to their sacrifice.

595
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,679
Gone but never forgotten.

596
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,223
- Never.
- Never.

597
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,606
Cheryl, I have to ask.

598
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,943
How did you manage those bees
outside the tank?

599
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,947
Did you rub
some special insect-repelling ointment

600
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,156
all over your body?

601
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,368
The truth?

602
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,750
I didn't have any ointment
on any part of my body.

603
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,794
What are you saying?

604
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:34,306
Something inside me has shifted.

605
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,349
Kevin...

606
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,938
something powerful, something...

607
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,357
I can't explain.

608
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,859
But...

609
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:52,199
I'm feeling more connected to things
than I have in years.

610
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:58,414
I'm not saying
I'm the first-ever living saint...

611
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:03,961
but what if I am?

612
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:08,382
What if I, Cheryl Marjorie Blossom...

613
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,802
am the holiest of holies?

614
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,682
Wouldn't that be miraculous?

615
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,979
My name is Jughead Jones.

616
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,731
- Hey, Jughead.
- Hey, Jughead.

617
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,318
I used to be seven days sober,
but now I'm back down to one.

618
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,738
Hoping to make it to eight this time.

619
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,492
I'm worried about a couple of friends,

620
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:38,496
but I'm also trying to accept the things
that I cannot change.

621
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,331
And I'm grateful to you all.

622
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:49,131
And if there is some higher power, man,
I hope it's looking down on them tonight

623
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,549
and keeping them safe.

624
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,134
I don't know why.

625
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:56,764
I got this really bad feeling
about what happens next.
