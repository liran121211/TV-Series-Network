1
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,051
I'm not gonna
lie to you.

2
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:09,400
What awaits us
out there

3
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:11,054
is like nothing
we've ever
faced before,

4
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,882
but we will
not be afraid.

5
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:16,538
Do you know why?

6
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:18,148
'Cause
we're Bulldogs!

7
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:21,021
And Bulldogs
never give up.

8
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:25,025
Men, your mission
is to penetrate

9
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,113
the enemy's defenses,

10
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:28,115
retrieve your
fallen brother

11
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:29,942
and return
safely to base.

12
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:32,293
-Are we clear?
Sir, yes, sir!

13
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:33,468
Let's do this!

14
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:43,043
Twenty-two!

15
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:56,795
Reggie!

16
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:12,115
Let's go, Bulldogs,
let's go!

17
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,769
One more time!

18
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:16,076
Let's go, Bulldogs,
let's go!

19
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,382
I say "bull"
you say "dogs."

20
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:20,167
-Bull!
Dogs!

21
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,907
-Bull!
-Dogs!

22
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,953
I say "bull"
you say "dogs".

23
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,651
Bull!
Dogs!

24
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:44,452
I need
a little help.

25
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:51,894
Come on!

26
00:01:51,937 --> 00:01:53,069
Archie!

27
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:16,223
Rise
and shine, Sergeant.

28
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:21,271
At ease, Andrews.

29
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:22,577
You ready to
go home, son?

30
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,015
Home?

31
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:30,106
No, sir. No.

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,629
-I'm ready to get
back in the fight.
-Sergeant,

33
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,805
you've given
seven years
to the army.

34
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,459
Seven good years.

35
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:38,288
Every man in
your unit will
attest to that.

36
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:40,203
They're alive
because of you.

37
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:41,639
Not all of
them, sir.

38
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:46,296
I've done
some digging.

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,342
Turns out
the RROTC program

40
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:51,040
at your old
high school
has been inactive.

41
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,650
I can't think
of anyone
more qualified

42
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:53,912
to bring it
back to life.

43
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,305
With all due
respect, sir,

44
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,524
I didn't join
the army...

45
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:57,873
to be a desk jockey.

46
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,918
This is not a
request, Sergeant.

47
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:03,052
It's an order.

48
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:04,184
Sign your papers.

49
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,229
And by the by,

50
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:08,144
Corporal Jackson
just transferred in.

51
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:12,496
<i>"In the late summer
of that year,</i>

52
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,064
we lived in a house
in a village

53
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:18,067
that looked across
the river and the plain
to the mountains.

54
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:28,904
In the bed
of the river,

55
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:31,472
there were pebbles
and boulders...

56
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:34,126
dry and white
in the sun,

57
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,391
and the water
was clear and
swiftly moving

58
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,393
<i>and blue in
the channels."</i>

59
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:42,309
Look who
cleans up respectable.

60
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:43,875
Give me a break.

61
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,882
How you feeling,
brother?

62
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:53,972
Actually, they got me
on so many pain meds,

63
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:54,930
I'm good.

64
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,932
You?

65
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:59,021
-Going somewhere?
-Yeah, home.

66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,284
Riverdale.

67
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,634
Taylor wants me
running the RROTC,

68
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:04,722
working enlistment.

69
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,420
Dude, that's
messed up.

70
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:10,989
Look, Jackson.

71
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:15,733
I just want
to tell you
how sorry I am.

72
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:18,388
I really wish it was
me in that bed
instead of you.

73
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:19,563
I do, too.

74
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:28,311
Sarge...

75
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:31,401
the only reason
I'm still breathing
is 'cause of you.

76
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:38,103
Riverdale, huh?

77
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,193
It sounds nice.

78
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,069
This is my address.

79
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:49,898
When you get
out of here,
look me up.

80
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:51,029
Thanks, Sarge.

81
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:52,509
Will do.

82
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:48,522
Something wrong,
soldier boy?

83
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,090
Uh, no, no,
everything's fine.

84
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:54,005
Well, if you're hungry,
grab a stool.
Coffee's fresh.

85
00:05:58,096 --> 00:05:59,402
Or if you want
something
a little stronger,

86
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:00,664
you can always
head downstairs.

You're all
grown up.

104
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:45,856
Well, I don't know
about that.

105
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:47,554
But you,

106
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:49,338
-you're, uh...
-Pregnant.

107
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:50,731
Yeah, I am.

108
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,646
Still a bad ass, though.

109
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,038
Who's the dad?
Can I ask?

110
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:54,996
You can,

111
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,737
but I'm not gonna
answer you.

112
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,782
It's...
It's a secret.

113
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:00,523
Just for now.

114
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:01,698
But I'm glad to see
you're back
in one piece.

115
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,657
Yeah, yeah.
No, I'm good.

116
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,398
So, who owns
this place now?

117
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:07,661
Me and the Serpents.

118
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,793
We, uh, all put
our cash together

119
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:10,968
and bought it
from Hiram Lodge.

120
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:13,493
A girl's got
to be creative

121
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,190
to survive
in Riverdale
these days.

122
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:21,631
Toni, the bus ride
into town...

123
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:24,982
I can't explain it.
It...

124
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:27,898
Everything felt,

125
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,596
-feels...
-Different?

126
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,945
-Weird?
-Yeah.

127
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,555
I mean,
to be honest,

128
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,165
it doesn't even
feel like Riverdale
anymore.

129
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,558
Yeah, well, a lot
has changed
in the world

130
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,778
since we graduated
high school, Archie.

131
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:38,735
Yeah, no kidding.

132
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,956
I mean, for starters,
where's Pop Tate?

133
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,740
Well, haven't
you heard?

134
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,437
I thought that's
why you came
back to town.

135
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:47,831
No, I was
reassigned here.

136
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:51,661
Toni, what happened
to Pop Tate?

137
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,303
How are
the nightmares,
Betty?

138
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:26,957
Are they still
keeping you up
at night?

139
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,829
No, I haven't
had one in weeks.

140
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:30,744
Good.

141
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,702
I'm more than ready
to get back to work.

142
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:34,312
You are working,
I thought.

143
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,227
I've been assigned
to cold cases,

144
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:37,881
which means
I'm filing all day.

145
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:40,275
Betty, you suffered
severe trauma.

146
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:43,321
You were
and still are
only a trainee.

147
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:45,759
I caught serial killers

148
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,761
in high school, Dr. Starling.

149
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,458
Not like The Trash
Bag Killer.

150
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,940
You'd be surprised.

151
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,900
<i>I found something, Glen,
a connection.</i>

152
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:58,641
There was a set
of multiple murders

153
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,730
in Odessa, Texas
that just stopped

154
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:01,992
without the killer
getting caught.

155
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,472
-No explanation.
-Mm-hmm.

156
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:05,779
Two months later, in Fargo
in North Dakota,

157
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:07,781
there's a similar
string of killings.

158
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:08,999
The victim
profiles match

159
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,653
as well as the methods used,

160
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:12,568
and again, the killings just

161
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,525
stopped for no reason.

162
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:14,918
Let me guess,

163
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,703
you're thinking we have
a migrating serial killer.

164
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,661
Yes, Glen, I have a hunch.

165
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:20,576
Betty, stop.

166
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,491
You're supposed to be
logging in cold cases,

167
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,711
not sewing
the crazy quilt
out of them.

168
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,103
And the last
time you followed
a hunch...

169
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,410
Yeah, The Trash
Bag Killer.

170
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,673
I get it.
I messed up big time.

171
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,894
But how am I supposed to
make up for it

172
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:35,852
if I'm locked
in a basement?

173
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,593
How am I
supposed to
redeem myself?

174
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,728
Listen, it's late.

175
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,381
How about
we call it a day?

176
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:44,818
I can pick up some
pizza and beer.

177
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:45,775
We could meet
at my place.

178
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,649
I can't tonight.
I have plans.

179
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,781
Oh... Do you?

180
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,478
I'm meeting
friends for Thai.

181
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:57,787
<i>Watch as the hunters
take off</i>

182
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:00,268
<i>chasing down
their prey.</i>

183
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:05,186
<i>The gazelle,
while badly wounded, <i>
tries to run.</i></i>

184
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:08,145
<i>But after a long
and meticulous set-up,</i>

185
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:09,843
<i>the hunters
show no fear</i>

186
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,801
<i>as they chase down...</i>

187
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,425
<i>...with their sharp
teeth and claws...</i>

188
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:07,291
Where are you, kitty?

189
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,094
<i>Any nightmares
this week, Betty?</i>

190
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,098
No.

191
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:16,404
Sleeping like a baby.

192
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:20,060
Unless you're
willing to
open up to me

193
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:21,235
about your feelings,

194
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:22,627
about what you
went through

195
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,238
while you were held
captive by TBK,

196
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,935
I won't be able to
help you, Betty.

197
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:30,331
You know, when I
got to TBK's lair...

198
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:33,464
Teresa was
already dead.

199
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:36,990
It wouldn't
have mattered

200
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,426
if I'd gone in there
with an entire
SWAT team.

201
00:13:38,469 --> 00:13:39,688
He'd already
killed her.

202
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,083
That's true.

203
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:44,171
But if you had
waited for backup,

204
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:46,086
you might not
have been captured.

205
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,262
And the Trash Bag Killer
might not have escaped.

206
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:50,090
Yeah.

207
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:52,962
That was a mistake.

208
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:55,356
I regret that.

209
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,619
You haven't
said much

210
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:59,751
about your time
in captivity.

211
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,057
Two weeks.

212
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,058
Do you think
about a lot?

213
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:03,407
I think about

214
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:06,019
where TBK
might be right now.

215
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:10,284
I think about
the people
he might...

216
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,069
he might hurt...

217
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:14,941
because of me.

218
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,642
I'm sorry, I usually
have it turned off.

219
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,734
<i>I have to go home
for a few days...</i>

220
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:29,259
-to Riverdale.
-Okay. Yeah, sure.

221
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:30,695
And hey, while
you're there,
you can pack up

222
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,567
-the FBI
satellite office.
-Okay.

223
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,177
The one where you
and your serial killer
brother worked.

224
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:36,005
Yes, I will pack
up the office.

225
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,224
No problem.

226
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,617
You have to watch
my cat Toffee.

227
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:42,272
Sure. Yeah,
I can do that.

228
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,057
But I will
need a key.

229
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:48,931
And since I won't
be seeing you
for a few days,

230
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:50,237
do I at least get
a kiss goodbye?

231
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,934
Mm-hmm.

232
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,297
To one glorious
year of marriage,

233
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:08,908
to you and me
forever, babe.

234
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,258
Happy anniversary.

235
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,999
Happy anniversary,
Chadwick.

236
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,699
The only thing
we're missing is

237
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:21,094
a little Chad
or a little Veronica
running around.

238
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,965
But I have a feeling
this could be the year.

239
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:24,924
Don't you think?

240
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:27,665
Hopefully.

241
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,582
Maybe it's time to...

242
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:34,150
think about cutting
back your hours
at Lacey's.

243
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:37,110
It's 2021, Chad.
Haven't you heard?

244
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:38,502
Women can
have it all now.

245
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,244
I just...

246
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,986
I don't want
you to be
unduly stressed.

247
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,988
I'm not stressed.

248
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:48,948
Actually, I miss
being on the trading
floor with you.

249
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,471
I miss all
that adrenaline.

250
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,647
The highs of
a filthy huge sale,

251
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,779
talking smack
with the guys.

252
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:57,957
They called me
"the she-wolf
of Wall Street."

253
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,569
[announcer
indistinctly chattering
on TV]

254
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:03,484
Wrap this one
up for me,
will you, doll?

255
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,138
You want us to put
a dime on it?

256
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,966
With that spread?

257
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:11,187
Vinny, Vinny,
Vinny.

258
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:12,188
-Hold up.
-There's no way

259
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:13,233
I'm letting you
walk out of here

260
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:14,147
with this
pathetic excuse

261
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,278
for an apology gift.

262
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:19,108
You know
you're insulting

263
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:20,196
your own store's
merchandise, right?

264
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,328
Not at all.

265
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:22,111
But you're looking at
display counter,

266
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:23,678
off-the-rack items

267
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,027
when you've committed
a specialty showcase,

268
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,159
haute couture offense.

269
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,378
Trust me on
this one, Vinny.

270
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:29,684
You got to go big...

271
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:31,294
or your wife will
never forgive you.

272
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:32,774
T Dubs,
how are you?

273
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,297
Good, Ronnie.
That tip
you gave me

274
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:36,169
took my portfolio
through the roof
this year.

275
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:37,561
You've got
the magic touch.

276
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,215
I just call 'em
like I see 'em,
T Dubs.

277
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,521
Oh, by the by,
did Kendra
like the bracelet?

278
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,175
Uh...
So, about Kendra...

279
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:43,872
Ugh, T, not again.

280
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:47,006
One sec.

281
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:51,445
-Hey, stud.
<i>
How's work, babe?</i>

282
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:52,576
Great.

283
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,274
Katie and I are just
a little slammed.

284
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:55,884
You want to meet us
for dinner later?

285
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,538
<i>That's funny</i>

286
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:59,279
<i>because I went
to Lacey's <i>
to surprise you,</i></i>

287
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:00,106
<i>and I'm standing
next to Katie <i>
right now.</i></i>

288
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,977
<i>Hi, Katie.</i>

289
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,153
<i>You, however,
are nowhere <i>
to be seen.</i></i>

290
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:06,068
Do you have
any idea how
embarrassing it is

291
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,070
not even knowing
where my own wife is?

292
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,420
Forget that you've
been lying to me,
Veronica.

293
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:12,205
What happened
to Lacey's?

294
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,903
-I thought we decided
you'd work--
-I tried Lacey's,

295
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:17,427
but I needed
something with
a little more edge.

296
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,125
I thought we were
working towards
having a baby.

297
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:21,083
-Oh, my God.
-Or did you
forget that?

298
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:23,129
No. No, Chad,
you forgot.

299
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,695
You forgot
who I am,

300
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:25,653
who you married.

301
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:32,834
Remember how
it was in
the beginning?

302
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:38,274
Things were
so good.

303
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:41,234
You and me
working side by side
on the floor.

304
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:43,062
We were the power
couple to beat.

305
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:44,846
And the sex...

306
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,111
The sex was amazing.

307
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,420
What happened?

308
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,118
The accident.

309
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:00,122
Chad...

310
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,691
You use the accident
as an excuse to
try and control--

311
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,693
-You almost died.
-So did you!

312
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:07,477
You didn't want me
going back to Wall Street
after the accident

313
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,218
because it was
too stressful,

314
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:10,828
and I didn't want
to keep having
the same argument

315
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:12,961
over and over again,
so I agreed.

316
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:13,918
But that
was a mistake,

317
00:18:13,962 --> 00:18:15,137
that's not
who I am.

318
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:17,183
And the sooner
you accept that,

319
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:18,227
the better off
you'll be.

320
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:28,368
Ready, everyone.

321
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:30,848
And action!

322
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,763
From small town
to big city,

323
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:35,940
my killer instinct
always gets me
what I want.

324
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:43,122
Hermione,
my one-take wonder.

325
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,732
-You're my angel,
you know that?
-Thank you.

326
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:46,908
I wish all the housewives
could be as real as you.

327
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,039
Well, I try.

328
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:54,176
Wow, Mom,
you make it
look so easy.

329
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,223
Well, please, for women
who've been through
what we've been through,

330
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:59,225
this is
a cakewalk, <i>mija.</i>

331
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:00,530
Oh, which reminds me.

332
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:01,792
Andy wants to
know when you're
gonna come

333
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,185
join us for
an episode or two.

334
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:04,752
Mom, no.

335
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:07,233
I can't put
my life on display.

336
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:09,365
Especially not when
it's in utter turmoil.

337
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:11,150
What's wrong
with your life?

338
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,803
You're married
to a successful,
handsome man

339
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,631
who gives you
whatever you want.

340
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,024
I mean, you don't
even have to work
if you don't want to.

341
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:19,288
I love working.
That's the problem.

342
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,333
Chad wants
to turn me

343
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:21,377
into a baby-making machine.

344
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,074
So, you don't
want to have kids?

345
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:24,250
I mean, since when?

346
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:25,686
We have plenty
of time for that.

347
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:26,643
Right now,

348
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,428
I don't want
to be a mom.

349
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:30,560
-No offense.
-Mm-hmm.

350
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,823
I want to be
the she-wolf
of Wall Street.

351
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,869
Okay, let me
ask you something.

352
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:37,263
When you and Chad
worked together,
you outperformed him,

353
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:38,177
isn't that right?

354
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:40,222
Almost every week.

355
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,615
Okay.

356
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:43,225
That's threatening
to an alpha
like Chad.

357
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:45,445
He's vain,
like Hiram.

358
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:47,316
Every marriage
has its ups
and downs.

359
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,839
And as for
believing that

360
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,624
you have plenty
of time to start
a family,

361
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,452
honey, I think
the accident might
have shown you

362
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:54,802
that's not
necessarily
the case.

363
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:20,654
Let's try this again.

364
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:30,664
Happy anniversary.

365
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:33,884
I hate it when we fight.

366
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:35,538
Especially when
it's my fault.

367
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,498
We never used to.

368
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,760
What happened?

369
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,502
The accident.

370
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:45,766
When our helicopter
went down

371
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,246
on the way
to Marsha's vineyard,

372
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:51,075
I said a prayer,
Veronica.

373
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,035
If only one of us
will survive this crash,
I thought...

374
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:57,256
Please let it be my wife.

375
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,389
Let it be the woman
I want to build a life with.

376
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:02,783
The woman I want to be
the mother of my children.

377
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:05,568
And then we both survived,

378
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:07,788
and all I could think is
now we can do those things.

379
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:09,485
I don't wanna
waste a minute.

380
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:14,490
Does that make any sense
to you, at all?

381
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,015
It does.

382
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,977
But we're partners.

383
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,241
If I tell you that
I wanna do something,

384
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,418
and that I can handle
the stress of that thing,

385
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:32,595
you have to trust me, Chad.

386
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,295
I will.

387
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:54,922
Hold on,

388
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:59,013
you... have got to open
your gift first.

389
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,325
A new one comes out
each year,

390
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:07,978
so you can start
collecting them.

391
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:17,988
Well, Yvonne, I can see
that Josh was absolutely
right about you.

392
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:20,382
You are a woman
of exquisite taste.

393
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:21,557
Yes, I am.

394
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:23,429
I think I have
just the thing.

395
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:29,957
We usually don't carry items
that are so... high-end.

396
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:31,959
But I know a guy.

397
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:33,177
And best of all,

398
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,571
a new Glamerge egg
is released each year.

399
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:37,573
So you could
start a collection.

400
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:38,444
Oh, my God.

401
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:39,575
It's perfect.

402
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:49,716
Archie?

403
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,413
Is everything okay?

404
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:33,324
What the hell, Jones?

405
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:34,587
Hey,
Samm Pansky, please?

406
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,111
-Hey, hey.
-Jess, please.

407
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:39,200
Hey, Samm, it's me.
Can we talk?

408
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:41,463
Okay. So you'd rather
talk to your agent
than your girlfriend.

409
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,378
-That's awesome.
-Uh...

410
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,597
Can we actually meet
for an early lunch
at that place that you like?

411
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,946
Yeah, great.

412
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:47,469
All right.
I'll see you soon. Bye.

413
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:49,166
Jess...

414
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,604
-I have writer's block.
-So do I.

415
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:52,953
But I'm not
punishing you for it.

416
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:55,434
Can we talk about this
when I get back, please?

417
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,482
Samm, just give it
to me straight.

418
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:03,703
Am I still in the running
for the staff writer job
at the <i>New Yorker?</i>

419
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:07,228
No, kid. I'm sorry.
Just found out this morning.

420
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:09,491
But you shouldn't be
tryin' to get a job
as a reporter anyway.

421
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:10,884
I mean,
you're a fiction writer.

422
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,581
You should be workin'
on your book.

423
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,974
How's that goin',
by the way?

424
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:17,630
-I have writer's block.
-Mmm-mmm.

425
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:19,327
You got a lousy work ethic.

426
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,894
And a toxic relationship.

427
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:23,505
-And you drink too much.
-So did Kerouac
and Hemingway,

428
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,681
-and Fitzgerald.
-You want it straight?

429
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:28,554
Whatever heat you had
coming off of your first book
is long gone.

430
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:30,817
A year ago you could've had
a story published anywhere,

431
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,515
but now,
you're spoiled goods.

432
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:36,518
-Passed your sell-by date.
-I just need more time.

433
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:40,566
Scribner's called.
They're threatening to
take back their advance.

434
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:41,784
Well, did you hold 'em off?

435
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,351
They wanna see pages!

436
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:45,135
It all comes down to,
"Do you want a career?

437
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,833
Or do you want to be
a one-hit wonder?"

438
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,142
I can't hear you.

439
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:06,156
What?

440
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:08,637
Hey.

441
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:10,378
Hey, Jess.

442
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:11,640
Did you see this?

443
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:14,643
Did--

444
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's goin' on?

445
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:17,994
I'm gonna go stay with Hailey
until I find my own place.

446
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:18,865
Why?

447
00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:20,431
This isn't working anymore.

448
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:22,521
We haven't been working
for a really long time.

449
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,697
Also, literal debt collectors
are pounding at the door.

450
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,568
Je-- Wait. When?

451
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:27,874
Today.

452
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,702
After you blew me off
to meet with your agent.

453
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:31,442
Okay. Just...

454
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:33,096
Jess, please wait.
Don't, don't, don't
do this right now.

455
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,578
-All I need is--
-I don't know what
you need, Jones.

456
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,145
But I'm definitely not it.

457
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,191
Good luck with your book.

458
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:43,585
It's the only thing
you care about anyway.

459
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:04,563
Excuse me.
This is you, isn't it?

460
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:08,610
It is you.

461
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:10,177
Oh, my God.
I was just sitting over there
reading your book,

462
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,614
and then I look up,
and there you are.

463
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:16,357
Forsythe Pendleton Jones III.

464
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,967
My friends just
call me Jughead.

465
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:19,621
Cora.

466
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,450
I'm a grad student at NYU.

467
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:23,756
English, of course.

468
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:29,805
It's wonderful,
by the way... your book.

469
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,068
<i>The Outcasts,</i>which is
obviously an homage...

470
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:34,636
<i>The Outsiders</i>by S.E. Hinton.

471
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,683
And the love story
between the Viper leader
and the homecoming queen.

472
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:39,293
It's just so...

473
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:42,601
Romantic?

474
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,690
Sexy,

475
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:45,995
I was gonna say.

476
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,651
It's a very sexy book
you've written.

Where'd you get that?

487
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:28,821
In one of your drawers.

488
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,257
Is that okay?

489
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:32,781
Yeah, no.
It's not a big deal.

490
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,261
Uh, there's coffee brewing.

491
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,096
Hey, I remember this.

492
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:44,967
<i>New York Magazine,</i>right?

493
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:47,404
-They called you the--
-New Brat Pack.

494
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:48,536
Yeah.

495
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:50,059
The <i>wunderkinds.</i>

496
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:53,541
The season's best
and brightest young writers,

497
00:27:53,584 --> 00:27:55,108
with so much potential.

498
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,547
Full disclosure...

499
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,723
I've read the article
like a hundred times.

500
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:05,640
It's how I knew
that bar last night was...

501
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,774
is... your usual hangout.

502
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:10,210
What?

503
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:13,604
Okay, so I really am a fan
of your book. Honestly.

504
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:17,478
But I do have
an ulterior motive.

505
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:27,749
Would you mind
reading my novel?

506
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:29,142
It's only 342 pages.

507
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:30,665
And if you like it...

508
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,275
Maybe you could
give it to your agent.

509
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,321
Okay, hold on...

510
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:39,761
Last night was a ploy
to get me to read your book?

511
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:48,248
Forsythe Jones,
open up!

512
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,772
-Who are they?

513
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,992
-Debt collectors.
-Are they gonna hurt you?

514
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,733
-Forsythe Jones,
we know you're in there.
-Uh, uh...

515
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,473
We can see your shadow,
we can hear you...

516
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,911
-Let's go. Open the door.
-I'll read your book, I swear.

517
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:01,478
Could you, uh,
just do me a favor?

518
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:03,567
We're not going
anywhere, Jones.
-Please.

519
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,919
Can I help you, gentlemen?

520
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:08,137
Where's Forsythe Jones?

521
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:09,835
Uh, he's not here.

522
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:11,750
I'm apartment-sitting for him.

523
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,883
He got a job writing
for a TV show in LA,
just left this morning.

524
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:16,798
Can I give him
a message for you?

525
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:18,365
Tell him to call us.

526
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:19,540
It's urgent.

527
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:21,760
You got it.

528
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:22,848
Will do.

529
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,812
Oh...
Thank you.

530
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,466
No problem.

531
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:33,946
But I'll expect
to hear from you
by the end of the week.

532
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:34,860
The end of
the week?

533
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:36,252
About my novel.

534
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:37,819
-And about you
giving it to your agent.
-Mmm.

535
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:40,082
And if I don't hear from you...

536
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,867
I know exactly
who I'm gonna call.

537
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:15,335
This is nuts.

538
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:17,032
I haven't seen you guys,
in what, six years?

539
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:18,860
Actually,
it's been seven.

540
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:22,081
Wow. Lots of
catching up to do.

541
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:24,431
Well, I had a job lined up
after graduation

542
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:26,302
with Riverdale Social Services,

543
00:30:26,346 --> 00:30:28,130
but their offices
got shut down.

544
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:31,090
Lucky for her, we needed
a guidance counselor
at Riverdale High.

545
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,874
You're looking at
the new Mrs. Burble.

546
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:35,529
Wait. You're working at
Riverdale High, too, Kev?

547
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:36,399
Mmm.

548
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:38,053
Yep. I'm the drama teacher.

549
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,838
Got my BA
from Carnegie Mellon,

550
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,448
in Pittsburgh, where...

551
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:44,451
I've graduated from
the University of Pittsburgh.

552
00:30:44,494 --> 00:30:45,582
Okay.

553
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:46,801
Whoo!

554
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,064
We stayed boyfriends,
believe it or not.

555
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:51,850
-And now,
we live together here.
-Mm-hmm.

556
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:52,938
With me.

557
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:54,504
In an apartment
on Cloverfield Lane.

558
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:56,158
-That's amazing.

559
00:30:56,202 --> 00:30:57,986
Sweet Pea,
what about you, bro?

560
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,075
Mostly held down the fort here
while these guys were gone.

561
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,774
-And then when Toni got back...
-We decided
to revive the Serpents,

562
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:05,037
under my leadership.

563
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,690
I was crowned
the Serpent Queen.

564
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:09,563
Well, I gotta say,
this place is sick.

565
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:10,912
Pulls in a different
crowd, though.

566
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:12,305
What's with all the truckers?

567
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:13,915
Serpents drive trucks
to make cash.

568
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,221
Including me and Fangs.

569
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:16,787
-Toni had the hookup.
Impressive.

570
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:18,877
Hey, what about Cheryl?

571
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:24,360
It's cool, guys.

572
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:26,928
As you know, after graduation,
Cheryl and I broke up.

573
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,147
RIP, Choni.

574
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,062
After I got back
from Highsmith,

575
00:31:30,105 --> 00:31:33,065
I... went to go check on her
a couple times

576
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:39,158
Hello, Antoinette.
Cheryl, I, uh...
thought we could talk.

577
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:41,029
I'm afraid now
isn't a good time.

578
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:44,424
As you can see,
we're in the midst
of renovating Thornhill,

579
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:47,166
and I've got
my painting to finish.

580
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:48,254
Perhaps another day?

581
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:51,474
Yeah... Sure.

582
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:54,651
Cheryl, are you okay?

583
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:58,960
I'm perfectly fine.

584
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:00,875
Do I appear
to be otherwise?

585
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:03,312
My mistake.

586
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:17,979
And did you go back?

587
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:19,111
I did.

588
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:20,460
Not too long ago.

589
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:23,028
But this time I wasn't
Thornhill's only visitor.

590
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:26,118
Hiram Lodge was there
with his new
righthand man, Reggie.

591
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:29,121
Wait, Reggie's working
for Hiram Lodge?

592
00:32:29,164 --> 00:32:32,733
I will never sell you
my maple groves, you vulgarian.

593
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:34,735
Nana and I plan to be buried
amongst those trees.

594
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:36,955
-We can make that happen.

595
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:39,044
Goodbye, would-be usurper.

596
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,009
Business with Hiram Lodge?

597
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:50,142
No. He comes by
every other week

598
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:51,970
offering to buy
my maple groves.

599
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,014
But...

600
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:55,103
I'm really glad to see you.

601
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:56,061
Toni...

602
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:57,714
I wonder

603
00:32:57,758 --> 00:33:00,456
if you would do me the honor
of letting me paint you.

604
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:03,720
I...

605
00:33:05,635 --> 00:33:09,030
Cheryl, no one's seen you
in town in years.

606
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:10,379
Don't worry about me,

607
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:12,468
Nana and I are just fine.

608
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:14,688
There's no reason for us
to leave Thornhill.

609
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:16,211
Okay.

610
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:19,171
Well, after all this time,
don't you wanna hear about me?

611
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:20,433
Let's see.

612
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:22,957
You graduated with a 3.9 GPA.

613
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,525
You majored in Social Work,
with a minor in Photography.

614
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:28,267
And you did extensive charity
and social work.

615
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,399
Am I missing
anything important?

616
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:32,923
Well, other than the fact
I'm having a baby...

617
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:36,405
I'd heard that, yes.

618
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:40,496
Congratulations, Toni.

619
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,324
I won't be gauche
and ask who the father is.

620
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:45,153
Oh, and I'm completely
out and open with my family.

621
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:46,894
We've talked about you.

622
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:49,853
And they recognize
and acknowledge
everything you've done

623
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:53,161
to make up
for your ancestors' sins.

624
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:56,599
And Cheryl,
I think that they'd approve
of us being together.

625
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:02,431
I'm so happy
to hear that, Toni...

626
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:05,956
But it...
it's not nearly enough.

627
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,523
The Blossom curse runs deep.

628
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:10,309
I'm doomed to a life
of unhappiness.

629
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:11,788
You think you're cursed.

630
00:34:13,747 --> 00:34:14,965
Beloved TT...

631
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:19,144
Are you familiar
with the Winchester House?

632
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:21,668
I have seen the movie
with Helen Mirren.

633
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:25,454
Sarah Winchester came
from a family of rifle makers.

634
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:27,152
Winchester rifles.

635
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:29,545
One by one,

636
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:33,549
family members suffered
painful, horrific fates.

637
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:38,554
Cursed by the deaths brought on
by their family's stock
and trade... rifles.

638
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,818
Only Sarah survived.

639
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:44,299
And so she started
to build a house.

640
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,955
The Winchester House.

641
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:52,960
And she believed
that as long as it remained
under constant construction,

642
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:56,485
the curse couldn't consume her.

643
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:58,879
Is that why
you're rebuilding Thornhill?

644
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,492
Toni...

645
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:06,016
I'm glad you're doing so well.

646
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:08,845
You deserve to be happy.

647
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:17,724
<i>She didn't say
another word.</i>

648
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:20,205
<i>She just painted me
for 12 hours,</i>

649
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:21,945
<i>and when she was done,
I left.</i>

650
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,947
And a week later, a package
showed up in the mail,

651
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:25,384
and it was my portrait.

652
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:31,694
She didn't keep it
as a reminder
of what you guys had?

653
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:33,435
I guess she didn't want it.

654
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:38,179
<i>Well done,
my dear.</i>

655
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:41,008
It's exactly like the original.

656
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,055
It's a perfect copy.

657
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,189
You've learned well.

658
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:52,324
Now, the question is...

659
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:56,719
Would you be able to replicate
the work of a master?

660
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:58,895
Like, say, um...

661
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:00,201
Rembrandt.

662
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,253
Toni, earlier you said
the town had changed.

663
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:11,560
I'm probably gonna
regret asking this,
but can you tell me how?

664
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:13,562
I think it might be better
to show you.

665
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:15,260
Okay.

666
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:16,348
Where you staying?

667
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:17,523
I'm crashing at the El Royale,

668
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,307
since my mom's
renting out our house.

669
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:20,395
Right.

670
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:21,875
The renters.

671
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:24,356
Um... I'll pick you up
at the gym.

672
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:25,835
Okay. Thanks, Toni.

673
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,750
Hey, do you mind if I stay here
to make a few calls?

674
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:29,099
Yeah. Go for it.

675
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:51,034
-Archie?
Toni.

676
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:53,515
I figured a steel gate
would be enough
to keep this gym intact

677
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,169
but this place
is like a war zone.

678
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,302
Well, wait till you see
the rest of the town.

679
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:59,086
Come on.
My bike's out front.

680
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,920
This was the fire station,
remember?

681
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:08,443
It was already
a burned-up shell

682
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:09,662
by the time
I got back from college.

683
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:11,359
No one's trying to rebuild it?

684
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:14,188
The town's entire funding
has been completely
stripped by--

685
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,798
-Hiram Lodge.
-Bingo.

686
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:17,539
And not only
is the fire department gone,

687
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:20,107
but the sheriff's office
is now down to one man...

688
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,326
Kevin's dad.

689
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,153
I don't understand.
What are people doing?

690
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:24,416
Fending for themselves.

691
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:26,287
The town's lawless now, Archie.

692
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:32,032
This was Pickens Park.

693
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,301
Where is everybody?

694
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:42,999
Whoever could afford
to leave is long gone.

695
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:44,871
Only the people
who are too poor,

696
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:47,221
too proud to move on,
are still here.

697
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,488
This was Sketch Alley.

698
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:55,447
Now we just call it
what it is...

699
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,318
Skid row.

700
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:59,538
-And those dogs are everywhere,
packs of them.

701
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:00,800
Some are rabid.

702
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,118
This is the fifth bus stop
that's been trashed, melted.

703
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:16,555
Five of dozens.

704
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:18,557
Nowadays, there's always
a fire burning in Riverdale.

705
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,036
Why burn a bench
for no reason?

706
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,429
Where are people
gonna sit for the bus?

707
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:22,952
Well, that's the thing, Archie.

708
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:25,346
Buses don't pass by
here anymore.

709
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,695
Sometimes my trucks do.

710
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:30,220
But only if they have to,
and rarely at night.

711
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:32,745
Bad things happen here
after dark.

712
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:35,574
They call this
"The Lonely Highway."

713
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:38,838
Why destroy an entire town
for nothing?

714
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:40,927
What does Hiram Lodge
have to gain?

715
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,232
I'll show you.

716
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:51,546
I don't get it.
So, where are the houses?

717
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,505
This isn't SoDale proper.

718
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,724
This is where Hiram's
building a turnpike

719
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:59,380
that leads to SoDale
about half a mile due east.

720
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:00,686
Hiram's catering
to the rich folk

721
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:02,165
who can commute into the city.

722
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:05,125
So he's strangling Riverdale
to boost SoDale.

723
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:07,562
And let me guess,
their kids will go
to SoDale High.

724
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:09,303
Actually, Stonewall Prep.

725
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,652
That place is the same.

726
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:12,524
Except Hiram bought himself
a seat on the board.

727
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:15,178
And so the nightmare continues.

728
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,180
Archie, there's actually
one more place

729
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:19,531
I think you should
see on the tour.

730
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:22,447
But you're gonna have to
brace yourself.

731
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,408
The Ghoulies moved
into my house?

732
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:30,106
Do you wanna go in there
and knock some heads?

733
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,544
As a matter of fact,
yeah, I do.

734
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,285
But first things first, Toni.

735
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:37,200
Can we go back to Pop's?
See if any of them
actually came?

736
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:38,245
Okay.

737
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:45,992
Archie, I heard you were back.

738
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:48,429
Pop... It's good to see you.

739
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:51,389
-I missed you.
-Say, I missed all of you.

740
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,621
Archie. Toni.

741
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:09,015
-Veronica, Betty...
-Hi.

742
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:12,410
Jughead. I'll, uh,
leave you guys to it then.

743
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:13,672
No.

744
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:15,195
You're as much a part of this
as any of us.

745
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,723
Oh, guys.

746
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:24,160
Toni gave me a tour
of Riverdale today, and it's...

747
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,512
It's a hellscape.

748
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:30,906
I know I called you here
for Pop's retirement
party, but...

749
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,517
We have a much
bigger agenda now.

750
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:35,824
Riverdale's dying.

751
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:38,044
And we might be
the only ones who can save it.

752
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,146
Are you sure I can't
convince you to stay, Squeaky?

753
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:55,104
I'll give you more shifts
if it would help.

754
00:40:55,148 --> 00:40:57,846
I appreciate that, Tabitha,
but...

755
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,500
Riverdale is done with me.

756
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,763
And I am done with Riverdale.

757
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:04,070
Well, take care of yourself.

758
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:05,419
Will do.

759
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:21,087
<i>Her name
is Lynette Fields.</i>

760
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,045
<i>Squeaky, to her friends.</i>

761
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:25,570
<i>Not that she has many,
mostly she keeps to herself.</i>

762
00:41:25,613 --> 00:41:29,574
<i>She came to Riverdale
two years ago <i>
for a fresh start</i></i>

763
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:30,966
<i>that never happened.</i>

764
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,579
<i>Now, she was 21,
and it was time to go.</i>

765
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:37,538
<i>"Maybe things will be different in San Francisco," she thought.</i>

766
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:39,801
<i>"Maybe I'll be happy there."</i>

767
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:42,195
<i>Unfortunately for Lynette,</i>

768
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:44,327
<i>she'll never make it
to California.</i>
