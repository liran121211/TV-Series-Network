1
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,261
- Previously on Riverdale:
-I just have to ask.

2
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,513
When you were pretending to be with Betty,

3
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,890
you didn't feel anything, did you?

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,892
I can't stop thinking about you, Betty.

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,020
I've tried, but it's impossible.

6
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,398
I wanted to share something.
A song I wrote for you.

7
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,943
Stop. Whatever this is, it's just over.

8
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,989
Hey, Mom? I'm ready to get serious
about the Naval Academy.

9
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,782
He's dying, Archie.

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,784
And I don't know what to do.

11
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,162
What is this?

12
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,206
Footage of our houses
being watched from across the street.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,042
For hours upon hours.

14
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,962
- Maybe it's a prank.
- This is an escalation.

15
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,213
It's a warning.

16
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,425
Or a promise of violence to come.

17
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,926
This was on our doorstep.

18
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,554
- Maybe it's a copycat?
- I've seen this place before.

19
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,015
Oh, my God.

20
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,059
Are they stabbing Mr. Honey?

21
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,945
Hey, did you reach out to Mr. Honey?

22
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,323
We did. He's fine.
No one's tried to kill him.

23
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,950
- Well, for now at least.
- In the meantime,

24
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,788
- mind breaking this down for me?
- It's the auteur again.

25
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:24,375
They've moved on from recreating a killing
to reenacting a metaphoric murder.

26
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,920
Us and friends getting Mr. Honey fired.

27
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,379
And there is one other thing:

28
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,673
I wrote a story
called "Killing Mr. Honey,"

29
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,676
within which was a fictionalized version
of this cabin.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,304
- I don't think that's a coincidence.
- All right. Uh...

31
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,932
Who else knew about that story?

32
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,184
- Just us. Me and Betty.
- Yeah.

33
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,852
Unless I'm being watched or hacked.

34
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,021
This is interesting.

35
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,400
- It's four ticket stubs.
- For, like, the movie theater?

36
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,319
Admission to watch the tapes?

37
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,738
Stubs have the letters B and V on them.

38
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,326
- What the hell? Like Betty and Veronica?
- No. Blue Velvet.

39
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,078
Like Blue Velvet Video.

40
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,039
The place that all roads
keep coming back to.

41
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,000
That video store
and that crypt keeper, David.

42
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,962
If he's not the auteur,
he's connected somehow.

43
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,839
- Or at least a fan.
- We'll bring him in.

44
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,217
I'll call you in the morning.
Get some rest.

45
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,093
Okay. Good night.

46
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,145
Early morning run, Archiekins?

47
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,272
Physical for the Naval Academy this week.

48
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,691
I find it hard to believe
they wouldn't be impressed

49
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,442
by my teenage Thor.

50
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,736
You could always serve
your country in the USO.

51
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,447
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, nothing.

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,493
Just this new song you've written.

53
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,458
That is... nothing.
Just something I'm kicking around.

54
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,752
Play it for me?

55
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,464
No. Ronnie. I stink.

56
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,466
And so does this song. Trust me.

57
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,430
Okay. I do like the idea
of you getting back into music though.

58
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,933
Right now my focus is on impressing
the commandant.

59
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,395
And you will. Because I'll be there
to make sure of it.

60
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,945
It's Daddy.
He wants me home for breakfast.

61
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,071
That's too bad.

62
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,160
I was gonna ask you if you wanted
to join me in the shower.

63
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,390
Hey. There you are. Come, sit. Join us.

64
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,267
I have news.

65
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,020
Please don't tell me
you and Mom are chaperoning prom.

66
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,396
We are. But no.

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,984
My news is, according to my doctor,
my core strength is building back up.

68
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,239
In fact, my grip is almost as strong
as it was pre-diagnosis.

69
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,532
- What are you saying?
- I'm beating it.

70
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,536
- I'm beating this damn disease.
- That's incredible.

71
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,206
It is, assuming it's true.

72
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,334
Forgive me if I call your doctor

73
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,878
to confirm that this isn't another one
of your stories.

74
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:14,962
Fine.

75
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,174
Does he know why you're bouncing back?

76
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,303
I've been trying
this new workout regimen that's helping.

77
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,942
Thank you, doctor. TTFN.

78
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,697
Well, it seems to be true.

79
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,199
This calls for a celebration.

80
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,201
Cheers.

81
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:55,128
Ah. He's not talking.
Unless you count movie quotes.

82
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,631
What did he say about his store's initials
on those tickets?

83
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,384
- Never seen them before in his life.
- Right.

84
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,929
I don't know if this creep is responsible
for making the videos,

85
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,558
but I can't shake the feeling
that he is profiting off them.

86
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,641
Same.

87
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,730
- Where's your partner-in-crime?
- Following up on another lead.

88
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,317
What exactly are you accusing me of,
young lady?

89
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,777
I'm not accusing. I'm asking.

90
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,989
If I made a videotape of you
and your classmates

91
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,991
murdering poor Mr. Honey?

92
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,160
Things haven't changed much, I see.

93
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,288
- Mr. Weatherbee, you're back.
- Indeed.

94
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,874
In time for senior prom and graduation.

95
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,252
How...? How are you?

96
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,465
I told Edgar I wasn't the mole.
He cut it off.

97
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,551
I make it through most nights
without waking up screaming.

98
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,935
Two businesses? Another besides
this community center?

99
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,228
Yes, commandant.

100
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,398
Archie is also the owner
of Andrews Construction,

101
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,485
a business he inherited
after his father's passing.

102
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:06,074
Well, I have to say,
I am truly impressed by you, Mr. Andrews.

103
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,867
- Thank you.
- However,

104
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,369
when it seemed like
you were no longer interested,

105
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,747
I started looking at other candidates.

106
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,583
Someone else you're considering?

107
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,543
Yes, a young man from Queens,

108
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,379
who's been training rigorously
for the Academy.

109
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,465
He's also a boxer like I was.

110
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,594
As you know, we have
a proud boxing tradition in the Navy.

111
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,180
I'm looking for a champion.

112
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:33,976
Crazy idea: If you're considering Archie
and someone else,

113
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,354
how about deciding
with an exhibition bout?

114
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,147
Right here at the El Royale.

115
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:43,194
I do feel that Archie and this young man
are otherwise evenly matched.

116
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,240
Okay. I'll have my office reach out
to KO Kelly,

117
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,118
see how quickly
he can hop a train to Riverdale.

118
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,995
Wait a minute.
KO Kelly is your other candidate?

119
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,497
Yes, why? You know him?

120
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,252
Um... Yes. He's only dating
one of my BFFs, Katy Keene.

121
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,551
Well, Miss Bell was a bust.

122
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,346
Charles isn't having much luck
with the video store's owner either.

123
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,765
I do have an idea
of someone we could talk to

124
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,642
who might be able to give us dirt.

125
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,979
The only caveat being
he's tried to kill me.

126
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,318
Our momentous day is almost
upon us, Tee-Tee.

127
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,406
Can I ask, why do you wanna be
prom queen so badly?

128
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,366
"Want," Tee-Tee?

129
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,161
Does Elizabeth want to be
the queen of England?

130
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,247
A better question is,
why don't you wanna be prom queen?

131
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,665
Listen.

132
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,918
If it's important to you,
it's important to me.

133
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,547
But the only royalty I care about
is being Serpent Queen.

134
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,215
Which I will be. Again.

135
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,760
- You'll see.
- Hey, Cheryl. Toni.

136
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,305
Is this where I sign up
to run for prom person?

137
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,807
Oh, no, Kev.
I don't think you wanna do that.

138
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,225
No, I don't, actually.

139
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,312
But Fangs has always wanted
to be prom king, so...

140
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,647
- here we are.
- I hate to rain on Fangs's parade,

141
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,108
but Toni and I are campaigning
to be co-queens,

142
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,235
and it has been my destiny since birth.

143
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,114
I have spent my entire life
fantasizing about being prom queen.

144
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,492
A part of that is I exist in a world

145
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,871
where everyone wants me to be prom queen
and certainly not themselves.

146
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,372
Make sense?

147
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,542
Yeah. Yeah.

148
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,630
Thank you. As my friend,
I knew you'd understand.

149
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,393
Whatever happens with your fight,

150
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,647
I've booked us the presidential suite
at the Five Seasons for our...

151
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,149
après-prom rendezvous.

152
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:50,947
It'll be just you, me,
a bathtub full of rose petals, and...

153
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,865
KO Kelly!

154
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,492
Ronnie.

155
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,993
- Hi.
- Hey.

156
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,373
Welcome to Riverdale.
KO, this is Archie Andrews.

157
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,583
Archie, this is KO Kelly.

158
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,669
So, you're my competition.

159
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,089
No offense, but are we
in the same weight class?

160
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,176
- I'm bigger than I look, bro.
- Boys, boys.

161
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,303
Save the sparring for the ring.

162
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,806
I promised Katy I'd show KO a good time.

163
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,476
Yeah, I'm down. But first,
know where I can drop my stuff?

164
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,771
As a matter of fact, I do.
Archie has graciously agreed

165
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,857
to have you stay with him
and train at his gym.

166
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,736
- I'm heading there now if you need a ride.
- All right. Play nice.

167
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,535
Well, well, well...
Never thought I'd see you two again.

168
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,036
What brings you around?

169
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,374
Look, Bret. We know you sold
your sex tapes to Blue Velvet Video.

170
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:47,461
The owner, David, keeps coming up
in an investigation we're conducting,

171
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,172
but he's not talking to us.
We need a way in.

172
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,216
We need leverage.

173
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,722
Yeah. I know David.
But if he's not talking, why should I?

174
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,560
See, I have a friend in there with you.
His name is War Baby.

175
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,564
Mm-hm. Know who he hates more than anyone?

176
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,400
Preppies.

177
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,237
What's the investigation?

178
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,535
Someone is making videos of us
and our friends

179
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,496
doing disturbing, violent things.

180
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,249
We think this David is connected to them.

181
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,502
Did he mention or host screenings
with the videos in stock?

182
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,757
Some of David's customers prefer
shared experiences.

183
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,428
Underground, immersive,
red-band screenings.

184
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,847
If we wanted to attend one,
what would we do?

185
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,098
Be on a list.

186
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,059
Or you'd have to...

187
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,937
prove to David that you're the real deal.

188
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,857
Bring him a tape.

189
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,319
Something to make him sit up
and take notice.

190
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,154
Say, a snuff film.

191
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,286
Holy moly.

192
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,039
That guy's gotta have 50 pounds on you.

193
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,374
Yeah, no joke.

194
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,126
What am I gonna do, Mr. Keller?

195
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,504
- He's gonna cream me tomorrow.
- Well...

196
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:15,800
Honestly, a little psychological warfare
might be your best bet.

197
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,470
You're smaller, but I bet you're stronger.

198
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,724
Let's show him.

199
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,104
- Got a mean left hook on you.
- Thanks.

200
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,481
Been punching bags since I was a baby.

201
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,819
I promised Ronnie
no betting on our actual match,

202
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,696
but how about you and me make
a little side bet.

203
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,990
That, pound for pound,
I'm stronger than you are.

204
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,869
Unless you're too scared.

205
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,498
Twenty. Twenty-one.

206
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,333
Twenty-seven.

207
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,877
Twenty-eight. Twenty-nine.

208
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,045
Ninety-one.

209
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,297
Ninety-two.

210
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,133
Ninety-three.

211
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:01,554
One twenty-two, 123, 124.

212
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,848
One twenty-nine.

213
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,267
One thirty.

214
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,269
One thirty-one.

215
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,521
Okay, I'll admit it,

216
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,481
you got more endurance.

217
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,943
When it comes to brute power,
we'll see who's stronger:

218
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,029
The Heavyweight Heartbreaker
or the Red Hope.

219
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,114
Yeah, we will.

220
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,325
And tomorrow, your ass is grass.

221
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,786
But tonight, Ronnie wants us
to show you a good time,

222
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,413
so we're going to her speakeasy.

223
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,999
Her what?

224
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,170
This is Riverdale,
but where do we get a snuff film

225
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,839
in which someone gets murdered on-screen?

226
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,716
Those are urban legends, I thought.

227
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,636
Not according to Nicolas Cage movies.
I mean, we can make one.

228
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,056
- A snuff film?
- Well, a facsimile of one.

229
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,517
Just convincing enough
for David to let his guard down.

230
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,269
Borrow equipment from the AV Club.

231
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,522
Jellybean still has
that fake blood from Halloween.

232
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:59,278
- Who's our murderer? Who's our victim?
- We just need a brute and a scream queen.

233
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,948
No. I won't help you.

234
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,951
No, no, Cheryl.
It's not an actual snuff film.

235
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,077
It's an act.

236
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,913
A way to get closer to the auteur,

237
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,790
the person creating
those reenactment videos,

238
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,252
including the one
with Jason and your father.

239
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,005
I do want to expose that defiler.

240
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,800
- What's this movie about?
- It's a classic tale.

241
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,345
One as old as time. A girl meets a boy.

242
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,805
Boy promises to make girl a star and...

243
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,183
then the boy kills the girl.

244
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,101
Charming.

245
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,354
Okay. But I'll need a wig.

246
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,689
Don't want anyone to recognize me
by my red mane.

247
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,774
Okay.

248
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,950
Well? How do I look?

249
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,745
- Oh, my God. You look incredible.
- What about me?

250
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,248
Terrifying, Reg.

251
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,501
- What happens next, Mr. De Palma?
- Yes!

252
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:59,964
Now, Reggie is going to kill you
in the most brutally exploitative way,

253
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,550
and I am going to film the hell out of it.

254
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,563
Is everyone having a good time tonight?

255
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,444
Excellent.

256
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,698
In honor of my friend KO's visit,

257
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,158
I thought I'd share
a little tune for you tonight.

258
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,786
Written by someone very special to me.

259
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,331
This one's for you, Archiekins.

260
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,470
All right. Now, it's straight to bed,
my burly boys.

261
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,722
Big day tomorrow. KO?

262
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,100
Please tell Katy that I'm sorry
she's not gonna be here

263
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,020
when my boyfriend beats up her boyfriend.

264
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,064
I'll let her know.

265
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,774
Good night.

266
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,195
- Good night.
- Wait!

267
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:48,905
Yeah?

268
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,616
I love you.

269
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,493
I love you, too.

270
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,293
I have a proposal I'd like to share.

271
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,088
Host a din-din before the dance.

272
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,757
I'm down. Who should we invite?

273
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,970
Mmm. The Vixens, Kevin, Fangs...

274
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,388
I was thinking...

275
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,766
our families. Specifically yours, my love.

276
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,646
Even though I'm out
to my grandparents, mm,

277
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,190
I'm their favorite grandchild.

278
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:28,070
I don't think they could handle
some big, gay, prom dinner party.

279
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,153
Well...

280
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,574
What happens when I meet them
at graduation?

281
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,080
Do I just pretend
like you're not my girlfriend?

282
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,250
Honestly, that's probably a good idea.

283
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,127
Tee-Tee, you can't be serious.

284
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,672
I know it's crazy and backwards,

285
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,966
but that's my reality, babe.

286
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,305
Hey, I'm curious, Archie.

287
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,975
What made you seek out the Naval Academy?

288
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,853
Well, all my friends applied to college.

289
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,814
I missed the boat on that.

290
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,317
And I got a second chance
with the commandant.

291
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,570
And the Academy...

292
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,448
feels like it could be
a good place to start over.

293
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:13,907
Completely.

294
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,452
Ah. Not completely.

295
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,455
You and Ronnie are in it to win it,
Katy says.

296
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,753
I don't know. Sometimes I worry
that I'm holding her back.

297
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,836
I feel you.

298
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,884
But that is for the ladies to decide.

299
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,218
Not lugs like us.

300
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,637
We lucked out.

301
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,225
Night, bro.

302
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,946
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Kev.

303
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,990
We have a favor to ask.

304
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,660
We're trying to sell a snuff film
to this video store, but...

305
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,080
I can't go in there,
the owner's gonna recognize me

306
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,582
from the time
I raided the place with the FBI.

307
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,542
But I don't want Betty to go in alone.

308
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,087
- You had me at "snuff film."
- Thank you.

309
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,381
Just have to stop by my house.
I need to grab a backup.

310
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,549
Just in case.

311
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,517
I need to talk to you, Nana.

312
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,103
I'm really hoping
you'll keep an open mind.

313
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,313
I think I know what this is about.

314
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,025
Your girlfriend stopped by, Antoinette.

315
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,361
My girlfriend did? What?

316
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,364
When were you gonna tell me
that you were dating a Blossom?

317
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,742
Nana, it's not what you think.

318
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,577
Cheryl isn't what you think.

319
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,706
That family, over the decades,
has taken everything from us.

320
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,709
- And from our people.
- That's ancient history.

321
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,629
I promise you,
Cheryl is nothing like her family.

322
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:55,467
If that's true, then why have you kept her
hidden like a dirty secret?

323
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,719
Because you know it's wrong...

324
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,305
No, it's because I knew
this would be your reaction.

325
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,307
About this? Yes.

326
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,269
I will not allow you to date a Blossom.

327
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,986
You look familiar to me. Both of you do.

328
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,363
You come in here before?

329
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,115
Nope. Never. Shockingly.

330
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,827
A classmate of mine from prep school
said that you buy videos.

331
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,705
Underground videos.

332
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,416
My friend and I saw this video
at a party last weekend...

333
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,584
And we boosted it.

334
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,420
It's of a girl getting killed. For real.

335
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,255
A snuff film.

336
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,175
Let me take a look.

337
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,898
Sorry, kids.

338
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,735
You were conned.
Or you're trying to con me.

339
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,029
But this snuff is a fake.

340
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,781
We were worried
that this tape might not be authentic,

341
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:04,161
so I brought a backup
that I know for a fact is the real deal.

342
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,295
I'm making this movie
so we never forget

343
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,380
what your daddy sacrificed for us.

344
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,424
You do love your daddy, don't you, Harold?

345
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,927
- Yes, Mom.
- What is this?

346
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,095
Want your daddy
to keep living with us?

347
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,681
- The birth of a serial killer.
- Yes, Mom.

348
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,352
- The Black Hood. As a little boy.
- Is that really him?

349
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,729
- The Black Hood?
- Yeah.

350
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,815
- That's my dad.
- And what happens to sinners?

351
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,402
- This is insane.
- Could I screen this at a little...

352
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:41,198
film festival-slash-rave I'm organizing?

353
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,367
...they're gonna ask
who killed his family.

354
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,453
Yeah. As long as we're invited
to the screening.

355
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,789
...but not Daddy,
because we don't want Daddy

356
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,708
- to be taken away from us, do we?
- No.

357
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,294
But you? You will do better.

358
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,837
You must do better.

359
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,685
Go, Archie!

360
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,061
Archie!

361
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,775
Attaboy. Go get him, Arch.

362
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,584
Welcome to the Film Society, girlie.

363
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,423
We got your daddy's movie
playing in Room 317.

364
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,391
Box.

365
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,690
Welcome to the Film Society.

366
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,319
- My dad's playing in Room 317, apparently.
- Awesome.

367
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,838
So, what are we supposed
to be looking for?

368
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,384
See if any of the auteur's movies
are playing.

369
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,344
Or if any of these people are fans.

370
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,982
Maybe just get a lay of the land first.

371
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:11,264
...saw kill his family,
make sure he doesn't say Daddy.

372
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,850
Can you do that, Harold? Convince him?

373
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:18,355
You're a good boy, Hal.
Your father let him escape. But you?

374
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,192
You will do better. You must do better.

375
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,443
- Betty.
- Yeah.

376
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,623
Box.

377
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,969
Psychosis is the loss of contact
with external reality,

378
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,972
a severe mental disorder
in which thoughts...

379
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,600
- These are all the auteur's films.
- Then he's gotta be in here.

380
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,608
Do you know who the director of this is?

381
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,863
Do you know who the director...?

382
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,447
You the director?

383
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,827
- Hey!
- Oh, no. It's just I'm such a big fan.

384
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,998
- See if I can get an autograph.
- Ponytail Playmate. Hotter in person.

385
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,966
Hey! Jug, we're leaving. We're leaving.

386
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,508
Go, go, go.

387
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,808
Attaboy. Give me two big breaths.

388
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,353
Jug, look.

389
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,234
Oh, that's him. That's gotta be him.

390
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,828
Come on, Arch!

391
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,464
- Jellybean?
- Jughead?

392
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,635
Betty, go. Let me stay with Jellybean.
Go. After him.

393
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,431
- What are you doing here?
- No, why are you?

394
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,516
My friends and I heard there was a party.

395
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,978
- Am I in trouble?
- No. You're not. Let's go.

396
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,317
Stop, stop, stop.

397
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,401
Fight's over.

398
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:41,957
Ladies and gentlemen, the first judge
has scored the fight in favor of KO Kelly.

399
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,381
Our second judge has scored the fight
for Archie Andrews.

400
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,552
And our third judge, the commandant...

401
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,891
...has scored the fight in favor

402
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,143
of KO Kelly, your winner tonight.

403
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,286
You're a hell of a fighter, Archie.
I'll tell you what.

404
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:24,374
Why don't we stay in touch, and come fall,
when you reapply to the Academy,

405
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,877
- we'll see if we can make it happen.
- No, thanks. I'm good.

406
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,255
Archie. Don't be disrespectful.

407
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,008
Your blood's still boiling.
I understand, son.

408
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,345
I'm not your son.
And I'm not applying again.

409
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,482
- Cheryl, what the hell did you do?
- What the hell indeed.

410
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,319
I thought you didn't want me to meet
your nana because I'm a lesbian.

411
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:56,489
But, surprise, it's me and my family
she hates with a fiery vengeance.

412
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,075
Admit that your ancestors
were horrible to mine.

413
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,245
Now my nana is begging me
not to go to prom with you.

414
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,622
She says it would dishonor our family.

415
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,707
Look.

416
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:10,295
I'm truly, truly sorry
I went to see your nana,

417
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,215
but I hope we're still going
to prom together.

418
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,094
I hope that when I'm posing for pictures
in my amazing dress...

419
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,432
that you're there with me,
looking equally undeniable.

420
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,982
How did you even know where to go?

421
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:35,612
My friend Lauren from soccer,
her older brother heard about a rave.

422
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,448
- From who?
- I don't know. Some e-mail list.

423
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,577
Jug, I swear,
I've never been to a rave before.

424
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,374
Promise me you're not gonna go
to anymore X-rated raves from now on?

425
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,335
Especially if I end up
in the University of Iowa. Okay?

426
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,545
- Yes.
- Do you promise me?

427
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,214
I promise.

428
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,524
Archie.

429
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,487
I'm sorry about the fight.

430
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,365
I wish I hadn't suggested it.

431
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,827
And I know this sucks right now, but...

432
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,956
the Naval Academy wasn't your only option.

433
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,792
- Yeah, it kind of was, Ronnie.
- Hey.

434
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,002
Listen.

435
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,839
Wanna blow off prom?

436
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,135
We could do something. Anything you want.

437
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,636
- Just the two of us.
- No.

438
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,305
This will be the last dance
we have with our friends.

439
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,808
Can't miss it.

440
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,311
Are you sure, Archie?

441
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,189
I'm in.

442
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,415
I still wanna take a picture of you, dear.

443
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,792
You look like an angel.

444
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,377
Thank you, Nana.

445
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,298
Perhaps your camera will capture
the sublime tragedy of my life.

446
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,677
- Okay.
- Don't start crying yet, Cheryl.

447
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,263
Toni. You came.

448
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,850
Was there ever any doubt?

449
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,273
Ready?

450
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,737
Oh, that's nice.

451
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,950
- Looking sharp, Archie.
- Thank you, sir.

452
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,829
Veronica told me about the Naval Academy.

453
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,499
- Unlucky break.
- It wasn't meant to be.

454
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,000
Well, look. Um...

455
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,920
If you decide to stay in Riverdale,

456
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,757
I'm in need of a deputy mayor
to oversee community outreach.

457
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,759
I think you'd be perfect for it.

458
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,640
Well, Archiekins, what do you think?

459
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,850
Am I dazzling?

460
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,478
Wow.

461
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,903
Okay, you two. Snuggle up for a picture.

462
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,906
This is a memory
you're going to treasure forever.

463
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:28,701
Smile and say, "Endgame." Three, two, one.

464
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,123
Damn, boy. You are handsome.

465
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,042
Like father, like son.

466
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,336
Oh, my gosh. Betty.

467
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,180
Betty Cooper, you take my breath away.

468
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,724
Jughead Jones.

469
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,102
The feeling's mutual.

470
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,314
Okay. Picture time.

471
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,527
Smile.

472
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,828
I'd like to propose a toast.

473
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,123
To surviving this crazy town

474
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,335
and making it a night
that we'll never forget. Whoo!

475
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,711
Cheers!

476
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,768
Happy prom night, lover.

477
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,063
Did you and Daddy have a nice chat?

478
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,066
Did you know he was gonna ask me
to be deputy mayor?

479
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,817
He might have mentioned it.

480
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,612
But did he tell you about my big idea?

481
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,449
- No.
- I'm going to defer Barnard for a year.

482
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,160
So, you and I can work together,
side by side.

483
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,244
Ronnie...

484
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,207
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

485
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,169
I couldn't live with myself if I knew
I was holding you back that way.

486
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,462
But you're not.

487
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,173
I'm choosing to be with you. My decision.

488
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,759
I'd drag you down. I don't want that.

489
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,678
I'd rather lose one year

490
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,347
than be out of sync with you,
maybe forever.

491
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,065
I wrote that song for Betty.

492
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:06,942
Come again.

493
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:12,407
The song that you found
and sang at the speakeasy?

494
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,035
It was for Betty.

495
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,248
I don't understand.

496
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,210
- Did you guys...?
- We kissed.

497
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,796
Once, during Hedwig.

498
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,050
But that's it, and we didn't want
to hurt you and Jughead.

499
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,015
Votes have been tallied
and double-checked by Miss Bell.

500
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:41,144
It is now my honor to announce
this year's prom king and queen.

501
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,151
Actually, make that prom queens.

502
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:52,613
Congratulations to Miss Cheryl Blossom
and Miss Antoinette Topaz.

503
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,908
Your new prom queens! Let's hear it!

504
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,583
Mr. Weatherbee, fellow classmates,

505
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,378
tonight, Toni and I are being
named Riverdale High's

506
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,298
first openly-gay royal couple.

507
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,760
However, no queenship is complete
without their court.

508
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,680
So, would my dear cousin,
Betty Cooper, Jughead Jones,

509
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,141
Veronica Lodge,
and Archie Andrews please join us

510
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,185
for the traditional promenade court dance?

511
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,844
- What?
- What the hell's going on?

512
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,970
What happened?

513
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,223
If this is another Reggie Mantle prank...

514
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,523
Don't think this is Reggie.

515
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,097
Stop. Stop it, please!

516
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,473
Stop!

517
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,007
Did they kill that guy
from Blue Velvet Video?

518
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,758
Yeah. Come on. Let's go.

519
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,306
What the hell just happened?

520
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,521
Well, we didn't get to finish
our ceremonial dance,

521
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,399
but we did win our crowns.

522
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,318
Come, fair Tee-Tee.

523
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,362
Our carriage is waiting
to whisk us back to Thistlehouse.

524
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,535
- What's wrong, my sugarplum?
- I can't go home with you.

525
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:46,996
Because of your nana.

526
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,501
- I thought you picked me.
- For tonight I did.

527
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:57,506
She said if I didn't get home by midnight,
she would never speak to me again.

528
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,258
I hope you can understand.

529
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,219
Of course.

530
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,720
Toni,

531
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,474
family is the most important thing.

532
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,144
Go and be with your nana.

533
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,856
And thank you for tonight.

534
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:19,904
Despite those moments of video horror,
I will treasure these memories.

535
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,366
- Always.
- Thank you, Cheryl.

536
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:28,329
I'm sure we'll be able to work it out.
She just needs time.

537
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,789
- Okay?
- Okay.

538
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,093
I don't wanna finish
this conversation.

539
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,637
But we have to.

540
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,598
I know.

541
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,894
Did Betty tell Jughead
about what happened?

542
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:52,978
No.

543
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,484
We both swore we wouldn't.

544
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,741
We should keep it that way.

545
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,702
No need to blow them up, too.

546
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,831
I agree.

547
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,839
What do we do now?

548
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:27,138
Our last two weeks of high school
are going to be fraught.

549
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:32,018
And I don't want them overshadowed by...

550
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,438
this.

551
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,817
So, after graduation...

552
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,447
we go our separate ways, Archie.

553
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,906
No big drama.

554
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,451
No fireworks.

555
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,955
I'll go to Barnard and...

556
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,460
you do whatever feels right to you.

557
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,154
Where did they go?

558
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,574
- Where's the creepy video store guy?
- And our doppelgangers.

559
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:32,161
Why do all of our dances turn
into a Jamie Lee Curtis movie?

560
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:46,925
Veronica?

561
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,554
What's wrong?

562
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,849
Was it that horrible video?

563
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,268
No.

564
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,356
It's not that, Mom.

565
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,154
Something happened
between Betty and Archie.

566
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,698
Oh, honey.

567
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,539
I'm so sorry.

568
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:18,957
It's okay.

569
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:22,962
It'll be okay.

570
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,427
There, there, my child.

571
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,514
It shall all be fine in the end.

572
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,642
- Not this time, Nana.
- Oh...

573
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:40,521
Tonight I realized
Toni and I won't end up together.

574
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:44,400
Once again, I'm a victim
of this family's curse.

575
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,112
I can no longer outrun my fate.

576
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,031
I am a Blossom.

577
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,868
Destined to be alone.

578
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,665
We've got an APB out for David.

579
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:03,711
If he's behind the videos
and he is fleeing, he's not gonna get far.

580
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:07,173
But what if he wasn't the auteur
and he was really killed?

581
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,426
Then the video shown at prom
was an actual snuff film.

582
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,470
What do we do? What can we do?

583
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,514
- Continue our search for David.
- Or wait for the next video.

584
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,894
Pray that it's not the straw
that breaks the camel's back.
