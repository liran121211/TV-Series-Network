-He's putting his life in danger, Mom.

174
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:49,148
More importantly, his behavior is putting
our lives in danger.

175
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,485
He has to stop. You know that, right?

176
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,862
[dramatic music playing]

177
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,572
Your father is a fool.

178
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,159
What do I need to do?

179
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,372
Well, first,

180
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,459
sell us your shares of Lodge Industries.

181
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,213
You also need to give us
a copy of his little black book.

182
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,549
The one with his underworld contacts.

183
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,510
We know he has one.

184
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,929
Hmph.

185
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,226
Sounds like you two are planning
a hostile takeover.

186
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,229
I am so in.

187
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,358
[Charles] Thanks for meeting me.
Forensics is on the way.

188
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,446
You were right, Jughead.
David was tying up loose ends.

189
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,448
First Bret, then himself.

190
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,825
So much for answers.

191
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,077
[shocking music playing]

192
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,578
Dead men tell no tales.

193
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,457
Did David seem suicidal to you?

194
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,460
Maybe he decided
suicide was his only escape.

195
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,586
It's plausible.

196
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,964
I don't know.

197
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,094
It all just feels a little too neat.

198
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,141
-[Archie] What's going on, Mom?
-[Mary] Hey.

199
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,893
I wanna talk to you about a call I had

200
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,313
with a defense lawyer
for your father's hit-and-run case.

201
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,190
[dramatic music playing]

202
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,734
The judge is getting ready
to make his decision,

203
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,862
and the lawyer reached out to me,

204
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,573
to us, as your dad's family,

205
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:25,035
to see if we would be willing
to make a statement in court,

206
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,662
asking the judge for leniency.

207
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,497
For the dad or the son?

208
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,126
Well, George Augustine pled guilty
to keep his son out of it.

209
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,421
He's not contesting his role
in the accident.

210
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:41,343
But he might get a lesser sentence
if we publicly forgive him.

211
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,845
Forgive him?

212
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,975
Mom, I still have nightmares about
how Dad died.

213
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,643
I know it's a lot to ask.

214
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,732
So, I thought that maybe
we could write a letter and send it.

215
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,276
And you don't have
to relive seeing him again.

216
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,944
I see him every day.

217
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,530
-Ten, 20 times a day.
-I can only imagine.

218
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,743
Well, do you wanna consider it, at least?

219
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,663
[Hiram] Are you both insane?

220
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,584
Scaring off my associates
with false threats about the FBI?

221
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,338
Taking control
over Lodge Industries' board?

222
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,509
-What do you think you're doing?
-We're shutting you down, Daddy.

223
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,512
You need to retire.
For our safety and yours.

224
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,554
Papi,

225
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,598
your reign is done.

226
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,187
It's time for you to let
the next generation take over.

227
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,730
You don't understand.

228
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:39,193
Reverting back to my true nature has
given me back my strength, my stamina.

229
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,487
That's not how medical science works.

230
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,740
-We've cut you off at the knees.
-The hell you have.

231
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,408
[dramatic music playing]

232
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,870
Girls, all I need to do business
are my fists and a gun.

233
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,207
Get the hell out of my study
before I throw you both out.

234
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,709
Get out!

235
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,552
[cell phone buzzing]

236
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,473
Holy crap.

237
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,687
-Jug, what is it? What's wrong?
-Uh, nothing's wrong.

238
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,650
I was accepted to the University
of Iowa's writer's workshop.

239
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,818
Are you serious?

240
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,070
It's no Ivy League
and it's in the Midwest,

241
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,365
but it's one of the greatest creative-
writing programs in the country.

242
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,535
Hot damn! My boy's going to college.

243
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,371
-I'm so proud of you.
-[Alice laughs]

244
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,332
-[Betty] Mm.
-[Alice] This calls for a celebration.

245
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,418
Let's get in the car, go to Pop's.

246
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,754
All the cheeseburgers
and banana splits that we can eat, huh?

247
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,924
[Jughead] Come on.

248
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,010
[tender music playing]

249
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,728
Mumzie.

250
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,525
I've begun to think I've got work
to do here in Riverdale.

251
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,694
Important work.

252
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,155
Our family's redemption.

253
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,661
I tried to reanimate the maple business,
but the Blossom board shut me down.

254
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,204
Out of spite.

255
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:24,173
They have always been a bunch
of hateful bitches. All of them.

256
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,095
Make yourself scarce, Cheryl.

257
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,015
Go away. But don't go alone.

258
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,059
You'll need an alibi.

259
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:41,190
Tee-Tee, I know things have been
somewhat strained

260
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,525
since "Prom Night, Interrupted,"

261
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,528
so what do you say you and I take

262
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,324
a mini vacation away
from both of our families?

263
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,785
I say, "Let's get this weekend started."

264
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,870
[tender music playing]

265
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,083
[scribbling noises]

266
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,465
[dramatic music playing]

267
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,311
No! Shut up!

268
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,270
[Jeffrey] Stop!

269
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,606
He didn't do it.

270
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,943
-What?
-It was me.

271
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,904
It was my fault. I'm sorry.

272
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,323
I'm so sorry.

273
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,293
[cell phone buzzing]

274
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,052
-Hello?
-[girl] You have to help me, Betty.

275
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,429
[thunder rumbles]

276
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,306
Donna? What the hell?

277
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,851
Somebody's killing us.

278
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,478
What are you talking about?

279
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:05,941
First Bret, then Joan,
and I think I'm next.

280
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,985
My life is at stake.
I'm going into hiding.

281
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,572
Oh, God. Give me a break,
you narcissistic psycho.

282
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,284
There's no murder conspiracy
against your preppy cabal.

283
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,037
We know who killed Bret,
and now he's dead, too.

284
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,538
Then what about Joan?

285
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,040
[suspenseful music playing]

286
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,209
Sorry. I'm not being drawn
into your twisted reindeer games again.

287
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,463
Whoever's doing this,
it has to be related to--

288
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,132
Oh, to when you tried
to kill my boyfriend with a rock?

289
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,259
Yeah. Never call me again.

290
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,427
Bye, Donna.

291
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,266
[Betty] Hi, can I speak
to Joan Berkeley, please?

292
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,771
[woman] No, I'm afraid not.
Joan's passed away. Who is this?

293
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,272
Oh, my God. Um...

294
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:50,027
I'm a classmate of hers
from Stonewall Prep.

295
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,944
Donna?

296
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,489
Yes, it's Donna.

297
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,284
I don't mean to upset you further,
but how did it happen?

298
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,952
Joan was murdered.

299
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,330
She was walking home
from school through the woods,

300
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,541
someone came up behind her
and hit her on the head with a rock.

301
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,213
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Please accept my condolences.

302
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,554
Okay, Donna may not have been lying.

303
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,058
Now we have a preppy murderer
on the loose?

304
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,602
Apparently.

305
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,313
Hope Donna's somewhere safe.

306
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,944
I've been thinking about
Papi's stubbornness.

307
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:36,573
I may have a way of breaking him of it.
It's a one-two punch.

308
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,868
I deliver the first blow,
you deliver the second.

309
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,413
-What are you talking about?
-Papi's delusions.

310
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,959
He thinks that acting
like a street brawler

311
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,919
is what's keeping him healthy.

312
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:53,882
But you told me the last time
he got roughed up, he called you for help.

313
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,509
Which you gave.

314
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,512
So, it's time we burst his bubble

315
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,765
and show him that you
in no way condone his behavior.

316
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,060
What would you have me do instead?

317
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,313
The exact opposite.

318
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,489
-[door opens]
-[George] Archie Andrews?

319
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,620
Mr. Augustine?

320
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,623
What are you doing here?

321
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,419
Look, if this is about the letter,
I haven't written it yet.

322
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,341
There's been a change in the proceedings.

323
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:43,473
My son took it upon himself
to confess to the hit-and-run.

324
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,269
They're charging him as an adult.

325
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,521
[dramatic music playing]

326
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,691
Would you write the letter for him
and not me?

327
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,109
It could mean the difference

328
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,528
between months or years
of jail time for Jeffrey.

329
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,824
Mr. Augustine, I've...

330
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,581
I've thought about what your son did
over the last few months.

331
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,337
He hit my dad.

332
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,426
And that was an accident, yeah.
Something I might have done.

333
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,847
But I'll tell you one thing
I never would have done:

334
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,645
I never would have kept driving.

335
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,316
I never would have left him or anyone.

336
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,653
Okay, that wasn't an accident.

337
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,740
-He was so scared.
-And what do you think my dad was?

338
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,503
[shocking music playing]

339
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,384
So, David wasn't the auteur?

340
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,637
Or maybe this is one of his accomplices.

341
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,729
[gasps] Oh, my God.

342
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,276
He did it. He's finally got in the house.

343
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,587
Wait, that's me.

344
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,056
That's it. We're getting out of here.

345
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,058
-We have to leave.
-Everybody pack a bag.

346
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,144
We'll check into the Five Seasons.

347
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,647
[cell phone buzzing]

348
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,112
[Veronica sighs] Here we go.

349
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,789
Oh, my God. Daddy, what happened?

350
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,209
I got jumped outside the mayor's office.
Some hoods were waiting for me.

351
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,338
Hey, can you get the first aid kit?

352
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,423
[dramatic music playing]

353
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,801
No.

354
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,645
Your astrological sign might be
the scorpion, Daddy,

355
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,733
but, in fact, you're like a dog.

356
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,153
A dog who needs to be trained.

357
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,281
When a dog soils a carpet,
you know what you do?

358
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,160
You rub his nose in it.

359
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,206
How many times is this going to happen?

360
00:22:54,998 --> 00:23:00,629
How many times are you gonna be attacked
and beaten by younger, stronger men?

361
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,589
What's the point of battling a disease

362
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:07,052
if you're just gonna get yourself killed
on the street like some mangy dog?

363
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,137
Be smarter than that.

364
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,057
Go out on top. Exit gracefully.

365
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,350
And with dignity.

366
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,561
Better that than to die on the street...

367
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,606
blood flowing into the gutter.

368
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,736
Think about that

369
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,449
as you lick
your own wounds tonight, perrito.

370
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,631
[Hermosa] Good job.

371
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,510
Looks like you are a Lodge after all.

372
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,681
What did you have your men do to him?

373
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,225
He's worse than last time.

374
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,520
Papi needed to be taught a lesson.
That's exactly what we did.

375
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,072
Nana?

376
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,867
Pray tell, who are you mourning?

377
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:17,414
The entire Blossom family has sailed
into the underworld, Cheryl.

378
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,542
It's just us now.

379
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,086
What? What happened?

380
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,880
They poisoned themselves.

381
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,965
[dramatic music playing]

382
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:32,053
A, um, suicide note
in Cricket's pocket stated

383
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:38,018
that our extended family wanted
to sacrifice themselves

384
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:42,230
to atone for all the ancient Blossom sins.

385
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,816
Hmph.

386
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,153
How timely.

387
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,533
And, Mumzie, I'm sure
you had nothing to do with this?

388
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:03,084
Consider it
an early graduation gift, Cheryl.

389
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,047
With the Blossom board no more,
you now have full control

390
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,966
of all Blossom holdings to do with
as you please.

391
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,478
So, our parents have calmed down,
Jellybean's asleep,

392
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,064
-and I'm filled with dread.
-Yeah, me, too.

393
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,691
Jug, if the auteur got into the house,

394
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,319
he's probably been inside
many times before.

395
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,654
Definitely.

396
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,408
Given the supposedly
privileged information he seems to have

397
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,202
about us and our friends,

398
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,872
maybe he's been doing more
than just watching.

399
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,707
Like what, listening?

400
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,836
You don't think...?

401
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,382
Who likes to bug phones?

402
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,638
Who else would have the resources
to kill Joan in the outside world

403
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,848
and the connections
to kill Bret inside prison?

404
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,521
-We have to go back to the house.
-Fun times, Cooper.

405
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,315
[suspenseful music playing]

406
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,236
[door opens]

407
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,780
[door closes]

408
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,952
I got your message.

409
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,579
Thanks for coming, Charles.

410
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,376
Found your bug.

411
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,713
On the phone.

412
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,884
Same kind you gave me
to use on the Stonies.

413
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,140
You got sloppy.

414
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,184
Or overconfident.

415
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,980
Or maybe I wanted to be caught.

416
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,983
Just waiting for you to catch up.

417
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:54,195
You've been listening to
our phone conversations since Halloween.

418
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,363
If not before.

419
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,368
Yes. But only to protect you, Betty.

420
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,623
You killed Joan and Bret. Don't lie to me.

421
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,876
I'll know.

422
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,380
I did. Yes.

423
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:18,303
And you tried to kill Donna,
but she slipped away. Why?

424
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:22,390
Donna and her friends committed
a heinous crime and got away with it.

425
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,770
-It didn't sit well with me.
-Bret didn't. He was in prison.

426
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,063
Bret was odious.

427
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,065
[Jughead] Yes, he was.

428
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,610
It took us a second
to figure out how you did it.

429
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:37,155
Killing Bret in prison.
But then it made so much sense.

430
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,326
Your boyfriend, Chic, killed him.

431
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,538
I love you, babe.

432
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,041
I love you, too.

433
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,670
Bret was gonna tell us
that you and Chic were still in deep.

434
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,048
True love knows no boundaries.

435
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:59,010
I'll guess that Joan and Bret aren't
the only people you've killed.

436
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,013
That's correct. How'd you guess?

437
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,642
Because you taught me
everything I know about serial killers.

438
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,771
Because that's what you are, isn't it?

439
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,566
You're so good at identifying us.

440
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,154
But I was your blind spot.

441
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,741
And I only kill people who deserve it.

442
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,036
Horrible people
who hurt those that I love. [sighs]

443
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,707
Betty, I'm putting myself in your hands.

444
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,088
You're going to prison
for the rest of your life.

445
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,966
You'll come with us and you'll confess

446
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,927
to all of your crimes,
including the videotapes.

447
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,930
Oh, no. I'm not the auteur.

448
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,182
Yes, you are.

449
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,935
You killed David,
made it look like a suicide

450
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,938
and then framed him as the auteur
because we were getting too close.

451
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,106
[snickers]

452
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,775
Well, yes, I... I killed David.

453
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,196
But he was a degenerate,
who helped scumbags like Bret.

454
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,285
-I'm not behind the videotapes.
-Who is?

455
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,333
What kind of teacher would I be
if I just gave you the answer?

456
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,128
You'll figure it out.

457
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,131
I have no doubt.

458
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,805
[Hiram] I've given some thought

459
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,933
to what the two of you have been
saying about me...

460
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,019
retiring.

461
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,065
And as much as I hate to admit it,
maybe you have a point.

462
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,943
Though, if I do choose to step down,

463
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,154
what would that even look like?

464
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,573
You would take a break

465
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:47,118
while I go to Barnard
and Hermosa handles business affairs.

466
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:48,953
[Hiram] After graduation,

467
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:54,209
I'll take a long, nice sabbatical
to the Caymans.

468
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,837
How's that sound, mi amor?

469
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,506
Sounds wonderful.

470
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,342
But I won't be joining you.

471
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,762
I've also decided to make a life change.

472
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,848
To do what?

473
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:13,269
Three years ago, Andy Cohen asked me
to be a Real Housewife of New York.

474
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,524
I turned him down
to focus on my family. Remember?

475
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,777
But really, Veronica,

476
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,613
I did it to protect you.

477
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:28,368
The only reason I got back together
with your father in the first place

478
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,203
was to keep you safe.

479
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:33,373
But now you're going off to college.

480
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,500
Hermosa's back in the picture,

481
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,003
so I don't see any reason
to put my ambitions on hold.

482
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,716
So, Hiram, I'm divorcing you.

483
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,889
I am moving back to the city,
and I am becoming a Real Housewife.

484
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,726
And, yes, for real.

485
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,063
Wow, Mom.

486
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,315
You win.

487
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:05,363
But do take that trip to the Caymans.
You need a break from Riverdale.

488
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,242
And Riverdale most definitely needs
a break from you.

489
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,496
[Mary sobbing]

490
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,293
[dramatic music playing]

491
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:22,380
-Mom, what the hell are you doing?
-Is that what it was like for you?

492
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:26,968
Is that what the Black Hood did
to your father? Did to you?

493
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,052
I was a coward.

494
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,638
-No!
-Yes. Mom, I let him down.

495
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,349
No. Archie, just listen to me.

496
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,353
I called your Uncle Frank
after George Augustine came to see you.

497
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,149
-Wait. How did you know about that?
-He came to see me, too.

498
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:46,279
Archie, please, just talk to me.
I need to know what's going on inside you.

499
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,405
Nothing, Mom!

500
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:51,242
I wish you hadn't called Uncle Frank
and you hadn't watched this.

501
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,621
Send that to the sheriff.
Or to Betty and Jughead--

502
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,331
So more people can see it?

503
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,207
I got a better idea.

504
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,878
No one will watch this crap again.

505
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:07,008
Archie, no! No! No--! [screams]

506
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,138
Archie! Archie, please stop!

507
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,599
You're scaring me.

508
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,439
[sobbing]

509
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,820
[door opens]

510
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,035
They're getting their stuff
and coming home.

511
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,287
Jeez. Your poor mother.

512
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,748
First Chic and now Charles?

513
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:45,546
Two sons, one real,
one fake, both psychos.

514
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,218
How are you doing?

515
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,845
Are you okay?

516
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,391
[tender music playing]

517
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,102
Fine? I don't-- I don't know.

518
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:02,105
Like, of course,
my brother's a serial killer.

519
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,651
-I can't stop thinking about--
-The videotapes. Yeah.

520
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:11,447
Yeah, it just made perfect sense
that Charles was the auteur.

521
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,618
I mean, he bugged the house.

522
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,913
He would have overheard everything
he needed to make those recreations.

523
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,834
I don't know who else had access
to all that information.

524
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,295
What?

525
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,134
What is it, Jug?

526
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,766
-[intense music playing]
-[door opens]

527
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,523
What are you doing here?

528
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,984
Your mom called.
She's worried about you. So am I.

529
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:51,696
I'm sorry, but you don't get
to worry about me. You left.

530
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,907
-You have no idea what I'm going through.
-You're wrong, kid.

531
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,702
I know it better than most.
That hopelessness, the pain...

532
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,996
We have both seen people die.

533
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,373
And we survived.
The guilt that you carry with you?

534
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,876
-You can't just fight--
-I don't want your advice.

535
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:09,005
I don't want anything from you.
You're a fraud! You're a coward!

536
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,590
Is that all you got?!

537
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:14,010
I know you wanna hit me so do it.
Give me your best shot.

538
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,472
Pathetic.

539
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,100
If you wanna take me down, take me down!

540
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,024
Let it out, Archie. Let it all out!

541
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,408
Let go of that anger, son.

542
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,377
[sobbing]

543
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,341
I'm sorry.

544
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,429
I'm sorry.

545
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,394
[Jughead] Jellybean.

546
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,023
I need to ask you something. Be honest.

547
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,691
[suspenseful music playing]

548
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,693
Are you making those videotapes?

549
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,282
Yes.

550
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,455
Why?

551
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,047
[tender music playing]

552
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,468
I don't know what I would've done
if you hadn't showed up.

553
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,221
It's a long road you're on.

554
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,600
Takes years to heal.

555
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,271
Maybe even your entire life.

556
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,985
-I really appreciate you being here.
-Any time, Archie.

557
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,196
But if I'm being honest,

558
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,533
you're not the only reason I came back.

559
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,912
I'm finally ready to turn myself in.

560
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,083
Answer for the things I did
when I was a mercenary.

561
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,835
Really?

562
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,798
-Are you sure?
-The only thing I need is representation.

563
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,886
-You know any good lawyers in town?
-I might be able to think of one.

564
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,304
[Mary chuckles]

565
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,435
What's this about, Jug?

566
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,813
We should do this over drinks.

567
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,152
Betty and I found out
who's filming those videotapes.

568
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,237
[dramatic music playing]

569
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,323
It's Jellybean.

570
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,868
What? What, is this a joke?

571
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,622
No. Do you remember
that first video we were sent?

572
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,665
It was right after I went
to Stonewall Prep.

573
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,168
That wasn't a coincidence.

574
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,420
What? What is this?

575
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,631
[Jughead] Fast-forward.

576
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,514
It's literally six hours of our house.

577
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,601
You better start making sense.

578
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,729
The videos had the intended effect:
To unsettle us.

579
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,398
But that wasn't the reason
why Jellybean made the videos.

580
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,193
-What? What was it?
-She wanted me to stay.

581
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,821
The big brother she just got to know
was already leaving

582
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,406
to Stonewall and then to college?

583
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,661
She had figured the best way
to keep me in town was a mystery.

584
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,623
How--? How'd she even get the idea
to make videotapes?

585
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:34,460
Do you remember that weird kid
she hung out with and played G&amp;G?

586
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,087
Ricky?

587
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,591
-Yeah.
-Well, they started hanging out again.

588
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,010
He introduced her to Blue Velvet Video.

589
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,555
After watching their weirder videos,
she got the idea.

590
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,392
To film all those houses.
Jellybean and Ricky did that?

591
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,435
At first it was just
the two of them, but...

592
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,063
I guess they roped in
some of their friends.

593
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,190
Some kids from Archie's community center.

594
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,527
Once the simple, voyeur footage
wasn't making an impact,

595
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,612
especially to me,
she decided to up the game.

596
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,530
Guys?

597
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,784
I have an idea. Let's make a movie.

598
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,536
A real movie.

599
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,461
[Jughead] That first recreation?
You remember it? It was Betty and I.

600
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,673
She wanted to get my attention,
and it worked.

601
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,012
Then she moved on
to the Jason Blossom recreation

602
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,471
and Midge's murder.

603
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,309
Her and Ricky just rented
the original videos from Blue Velvet.

604
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:36,772
She and those kids made all the masks
and the props and the sets.

605
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,400
It's actually pretty impressive.

606
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:44,613
-Didn't they realize what they were doing?
-I don't think so. It was a game to them.

607
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,033
Like make-believe.
So much so that they ended up

608
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,786
breaking into Riverdale High to recreate
that "Killing Mr. Honey" video,

609
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,206
after she snuck on to my laptop
to read the story I was working on.

610
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,668
-[FP] Where did they do all this?
-All over town.

611
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,921
Their hideout was the Lodge's cabin
in the woods. The murder cabin.

612
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,636
And then David,
before he was killed by Charles,

613
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,139
gave them permission to shoot
the prom massacre video

614
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,724
inside the Scarlet Suite.

615
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,352
That one was bad but not as bad
as the one of Mr. Andrews

616
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,811
being shot by the Black Hood.

617
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:21,567
-And the video inside our house?
-That was her and Ricky, too.

618
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,737
She did all this to keep you in Riverdale?

619
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,323
That's what she told me.

620
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:34,413
I don't think she understands the enormity
and the darkness of what she did.

621
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,090
Sorry.

622
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,050
[dramatic music playing]

623
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,011
It's okay, JB.

624
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,971
It's okay, honey.

625
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,849
[FP sighs]

626
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,480
Uncle Frank and I will visit Dad's grave.

627
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,525
But I wanted to give you
the letter for the Augustines.

628
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:07,029
I'll make sure the judge gets it.
Thank you, Archie.

629
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,994
[door opens]

630
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,831
[door closes]

631
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,751
[Archie] "To the Honorable Judge Britton:

632
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:26,048
Losing my dad has been the hardest thing
I've ever dealt with in my life.

633
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,050
I miss him every day.

634
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,011
It hurts me and my mom

635
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,056
and anyone who was ever lucky enough
to have known him.

636
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:39,186
But I know it also hurts
Jeffrey Augustine and his father.

637
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:45,443
When my dad passed, I made a vow
to honor his memory every single day.

638
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,029
My dad didn't believe in
an eye for an eye.

639
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:53,033
He believed in forgiveness
and kindness and compassion.

640
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,162
What happened was a terrible accident.

641
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,582
But Jeffrey's life doesn't need
to be ruined.

642
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:04,628
That's not what my dad would have wanted.
It's not what me or my mom want.

643
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:10,468
Fred Andrews believed in lifting up
those around him and in second chances.

644
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,012
And I'm asking you to do the same.

645
