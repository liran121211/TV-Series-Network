-Hey.

Hey, babe.
How was the store?

13
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:35,383
I had to go to
a couple different places,
but I got regular milk,

14
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:40,388
oat milk, almond milk
and two varieties
of sugary cereals.

15
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:44,261
You're the best, Kev.
I'm sorry about
all these crazy cravings.

16
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:46,307
-It's all good.
-Are you okay?

17
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:47,873
Totally.

18
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,921
Not nervous about
the big announcement?

19
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:53,270
Not at all.
Why would I be?

20
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,708
-[Archie] Okay, you ready?
-I'm ready.

21
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:04,151
Wow, I was so
not ready.

22
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:11,114
Now, what do you think?

23
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:13,203
I think you've come
a long way from
when you were eight

24
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:15,205
and said you wanted
to be a firefighter.

[Jughead] Thanks for coming
to meet us, Dr. Whitley.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,307
You mentioned
having a specimen
that needed examining.

30
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:31,265

00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,222
Um...

32
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,269
it's the damnedest
thing, Doc.

33
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:37,009
Someone stole it.

00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:39,099
Uh-huh.

37
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:46,758
Suddenly, this blinding light
appeared in the sky,

38
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:48,934
and the last thing I remember,
I was looking up at it.

39
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:50,980
But then I lost
several hours.

the Mothmen mummy--
-The specimen?

41

The specimen was gone.

42
00:01:58,074 --> 00:01:58,988
Hmm.

43
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:01,469
Mr. Jones,

44
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:03,253
I'm an anthropologist
with an interest

45
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:06,909
in extraterrestrial phenomena,
not a psychologist.

46
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:09,738
But in the majority of cases
like you're describing,

47
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,523
when a person claims
to have had a close encounter,

48
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:17,572
they are, in fact,
often repressing a
traumatic experience.

49
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:22,098
You said in the
majority of cases.
What about the other ones?

50
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,405
The other cases,
I believe they're
telling the truth.

51
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:29,192
If you'd like, I can perhaps
help you determine what
you're dealing with here.

52
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,889
Truth or repression.

53
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,893
There's a
support group I lead--

54
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,982
We're so sorry for making you
drive all the way from
your university, Doctor.

55
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:39,289
But I don't need
a support group.

56
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,118
If I am repressing something,
I think I prefer to keep
it repressed, you know?

00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:46,775
Should you
decide otherwise,

00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:48,211

the other bodies. It's like
it's been there for a while.

monogamous too.

we're about to do...

don't you think, Betty?

Oh, I can assemble a list

Oh, that won't
be necessary.

I already hired
my contractor.

104
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:09,874
So what do you want
to have done to your apartment?

Demolition. I want it all
torn out, down to the studs.

I actually wanted to talk
to you about stepping back
from the Vixens.

138
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,317
Tell me, did it really
not occur to you

139
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:48,146
to give me any advance warning
about your offspring's lineage?

140
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,541
Well, to be honest, Cheryl,
I wanted to tell you.

141
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:54,849
Not just as my co-captain,
but as my friend.

142
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:57,982
But based on your recent
behavior, I...

143
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:00,550
didn't even know if we had
that relationship anymore.

144
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:02,857
And did this harebrained idea
originate with Kevin or--

145
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,467
Me, Cheryl.

146
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:10,865
When I was a junior
in Highsmith College,

147
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,910
I found out that I have
a medical condition

148
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:16,174
that makes it hard for me
to get pregnant,
the older I am.

149
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:18,916
Oh.

150
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:22,267
Toni, I had no idea.

151
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:25,140
I'm so sorry.

152
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,709
Anyways, the doctor said that
if I really want to have kids,

153
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:30,058
I need to do it
while I'm young.

154
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:33,453
Okay.

155
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:37,413
-But Kevin and Fangs?
-Fangs is like family to me.

156
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,156
We got initiated into
the Serpents together.
And when Fangs and Kevin

157
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,681
started talking about
adoption or looking
for a surrogate mother,

158
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:46,640
I volunteered.

159
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,644
Splendid.

160
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:53,560
So you've got an insta family
while I'm withering away
at Thornhill.

161
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:55,779
Look, I'm having a baby
with Kevin and Fangs.

162
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:01,437
But I still care
about you deeply.

163
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,962
And if you want,
maybe we can still try
and make this work.

164
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:09,184
I don't see how
that's possible anymore.

165
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:14,189
But congratulations.
I'm very happy for you.

166
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,628
[school bell ringing]

167
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:20,151
You know, it's funny.
I always figured the first
baby would be

168
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,284
yours and Jughead's
or Archie and Veronica's.

169
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:23,764
How times change,
I guess.

170
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,593
Yeah. You're not kidding.

171
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:27,898
That sounded loaded.

172
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:28,812
What gives?

173
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,121
You have to keep it
a secret though, okay?

174
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:35,123
Oh, God.

175
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,559
Please don't tell me you
and Jughead
are getting back together.

176
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:37,517
No! It's...

177
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:40,432
It's me and Archie.

178
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:44,393
We've been doing this casual
friends with benefits thing.

179
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:45,350
Shut the front door.

180
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:46,874
Yeah, it's an...

181
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:49,311
It's an escape.

182
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:52,096
And we're in this bubble
and I don't want it to burst.

183
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,577
And I also don't want
to get in too deep
with him, you know.

184
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,144
Why?

185
00:08:56,187 --> 00:09:00,191
Because Archie's this
lit window in the dark,

186
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,193
and I don't want
that light to ever go out.

187
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:08,591
The importance of sight,
the way we see the world

188
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,985
or how we interpret what
happens to us is one
of the biggest themes

189
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:13,248
in the <i>Slaughterhouse-Five.</i>

190
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:18,253
Now Billy has "discovered"
the truth, and that's why
he can, at any one point,

191
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:19,863
be at his daughter's wedding,

192
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:22,431
be fighting the Germans
or he could be millions

193
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:25,477
of light years away
as a captive in some alien zoo.

194
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:28,959
Billy has
"achieved true sight."

195
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,526
Or at least that's
one interpretation.

196
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,658
-[gunshot]
-[dramatic music playing]

197
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,706
[boy] Mr. Jones?

198
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,578
Mr. Jones, are you okay?

199
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:39,883
Yeah, I'm sorry.

200
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,103
Uh...

201
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:44,845
What was I saying?

202
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:45,933
You said that there was
another interpretation.

203
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:49,719
Yes, that Billy is crazy.

204
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,156
[dramatic music playing]

205
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:56,291
[school bell ringing]

206
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:58,380
[Jughead] Hi, Dr. Whitley?

207
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:00,251
Yeah. Uh, it's Jughead Jones.

208
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:02,689
Sorry to bother you.

209
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:06,649
Upon further consideration,
I think I might be interested
in joining that group.

210
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:10,435
Making progress? Or are you
too distracted by my beauty?

211
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,829
I'm painting you as Diana
with Actaeon, the stag.

212
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:15,136
I'm sure you'll find
it satisfactory.

213
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,225
You have a unique talent.

214
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:19,531
I recognized it right away.

215
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,664
I had to have
an original Cheryl Blossom.

216
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,927
Once this painting is finished,
will you leave me in peace?

217
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:26,887
I haven't decided yet.

218
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,541
Oh, who cares?

219
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,761
After the dagger
my beloved Toni stuck
in my heart,

220
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,328
what does anything
else matter?

221
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,678
Go on.

222
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:38,463
She lured me
out of the house
where I feel safe

223
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:41,466
just to torture me
with her happiness.

224
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,861
It's cruel,
don't you think?

225
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:50,084
As an outsider, it seems to me
that fate has put an obstacle
before you, Ms. Blossom.

226
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:52,782
This Toni person's
happiness.

227
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:55,698
And you must either rise
above it, or...

228
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,441
Throw a little chaos at it.

229
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,010
[cell phone ringing]

230
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:08,842
Katy Keene?

231
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:10,321
How are you, girl?

232
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:12,454
[Katy] <i>Oh, my God, girl,
I'm reeling.</i>

233
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:15,022
<i>So I'm having lunch
with Francois
in the Lacy's Cafe</i>

234
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:18,068
<i>and who strolls in
with the heiress to
the Spiffany's fortune?</i>

235
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:20,418
<i>Chad. Your Chad!</i>

236
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:22,638
<i>V, what the hell
is going on
with you two?</i>

237
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,686
Well, clearly, he's trying
to make me jealous.

238
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:29,993
[Katy] <i>Totally. Which means
I'm about to pour hot coffee
into his lap.</i>

239
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,734
Perfect!

240
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:35,564
And I, Katy Keene,
will be fighting
fire with fire.

241
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:43,920
Wow, you boys made
some real progress.
Well done.

242
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:45,966
Oh, you know what
we should do?

243
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,229
Document our reno journey.

244
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:49,186
Let me get
between you two.

245
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:52,668
Come on.

246
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,369
Perfection. Now flex
for my followers.

247
00:11:58,413 --> 00:11:59,240
[Archie chuckles softly]

248
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,028
[cell phones chiming]

249
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:08,553
Is yours from Cheryl too?
She wants us to gather
at the Whyte Wyrm for drinks.

250
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,034
Well, shall we, boys?

251
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:11,905
I'm buying.

252
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:14,995
[music playing]

253
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,261
You know, I thought
you had a thing
going with Betty.

254
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:21,915
It's just a casual thing.

255
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,048
Okay, but what
about Veronica?

256
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:27,485
The looks, the smiles,
the banter?

257
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:30,271
-Dude. She's married
to Jackson.
-[laughs]

258
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,230
Sarge juggling two ladies.

259
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,540
-[Toni] Cheryl,
what's this all about?
-I wanted to apologize

260
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:43,110
for being so cuckoo to you
earlier. Will you let me
have a do-over?

261
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:47,288
Of course, Cheryl. You know
your support means
the world to me.

262
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:53,424
So, will you let me host
a modest celebration
for you, Kevin and Fangs?

263
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:56,384
Okay, sure.

264
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:57,298
Amaze.

265
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:03,565
[clears throat]

266
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:06,742
[Cheryl] Hear ye, hear ye,
fellow friends and fiends.

267
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,658
Now that everyone
is swan-diving
into sad adulthood

268
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:15,751
with babies and marriages
and arthritis, etcetera,
I'm throwing a party.

269
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,233
One last hurrah
to celebrate our wild
misspent youth.

270
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:23,498
One final chance to recall
our reckless teenage selves.

271
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,849
I mean, who could forget
my iconic spin the bottle
parties of yore?

272
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,546
Aren't we a little
old for that?

273
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,116
Which is why this little fete
will be a key party.

274
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,205
You heard me right.

275
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:39,688
A classic American
and oh-so-adult round
of sexual switcheroo.

276
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:43,170
We'll draw keys and pair off.
And if the spirit moves you,

277
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:45,302
you are strongly encouraged

278
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:49,829
to act on any and all
animal impulses.

279
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:57,532
I'm texting you the deets now,
but bring keys for my bowl

280
00:13:57,575 --> 00:14:01,797
and your well-oiled libidos.

281
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,146
[cell phones chiming]

282
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:14,723
Oh, my God, Polly!

283
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,333
When did you get back?
Is Mom... Does Mom...

284
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:18,770
No, no, you can't, you can't
be here. He'll find you.

285
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,860
-What? Who will?
-TBK.

286
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,645
-Wha... [gasps]
-[screams]

287
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:24,864
You shouldn't have
gone in alone.

288
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:27,475
[screaming]

289
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,045
Oh, my God.

290
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:34,351
[breathing heavily]

291
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:44,579
[typing on cell phone]

292
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:50,063
Good thing your mom still
leaves that spare key
under the gnome.

293
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:51,368
Beats climbing the trellis.

294
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,459
[mysterious music playing]

295
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:58,462
What's wrong?

296
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:02,945
Just a nightmare.

297
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:06,688
I don't want to talk about it,
though. I just want to forget.
Is that okay?

298
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:09,865
Yeah. Whatever you want.

299
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:23,618
Nice spread, sarge.
And you're up before me.
Not bad.

300
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:26,969
I actually haven't
gone to bed yet.
I was over at Betty's.

301
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,753
[sarcastically] Uh-huh.

302
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:31,321
-Shut up, Jackson.
-[chuckling]

303
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:35,412
I thought it was going
to be a booty call. Which I
was more than fine with.

304
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:39,677
But this time
it felt different.

305
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,637
It didn't feel great.

306
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,160
And if I'm being
completely honest,

307
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:50,210
you were right about
me and Veronica.

308
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,908
I mean, I would never
do anything about it...

309
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,521
but there's definitely
something still there.

310
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:03,397
So about Cheryl's party,
I was thinking.

311
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,356
It's like she said,
one last night of
carefree abandon, right?

312
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,360
So what if you brought one
of your hot trucker beaus
to spice things up?

313
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:12,623
I mean, you must have
a regular hookup, right?

314
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:13,973
Yeah, maybe.

315
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:17,280
Why would I
do that, Kevin?

316
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:20,414
We just closed
our relationship
like, yesterday.

317
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:23,983
Well, I've always been curious
about the company you keep
on the road,

318
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,987
and you never brought
a friend home per our rules.

319
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,686
Yeah, exactly.
So, why now?

320
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,645
What's going on with you?

321
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:39,999
Nothing. But before we become
husbands and fathers,

322
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:44,742
let's get every horn dog
impulse out of our systems
once and for all.

323
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:49,138
No strings, no guilt,
no secrets.

324
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,233
Betty. Oh, thank God.

325
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:59,496
Your sister. She called.
She's alive.

326
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,369
What? When?
Are you sure
it was Polly?

327
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:05,459
Yes, of course. I'm sure.
I know the sound
of my own daughter's voice.

328
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,461
What did she say? Walk me
through everything.

329
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:12,248
Okay. Um, the phone rang,
the landline. I picked up
and it was Polly.

330
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:15,991
She was hysterical.
She was talking
a mile a minute.

331
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,081
Um, I tried to keep her
on the phone, but she was...
she was scared.

332
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,650
Mom, are you sure it wasn't
just some crank?

333
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:25,044
Yes. She was scared.

334
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,351
Uh, she couldn't...
she couldn't see anything.
She was being kept somewhere.

335
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:31,615
It was dark. Everything was
cold and smooth, like metal.

336
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:33,226
Quite frankly, it sounded
like a spaceship.

337
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,360
In most of the
missing persons cases,

338
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:41,321
after two days, the chances
of a victim being found alive
are almost nothing,

339
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:44,106
Mom, Polly's been gone

00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:49,379
Well, well.

507
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:52,121
Looks like fate
has brought us
together yet again.

508
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:56,735
-Antoinette.
-How did I know this
was going to happen?

509
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:02,044
Destiny has manifested.

510
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,830
I could feel it.

511
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:08,181
After making this night
all about you, I knew we
would end up together.

512
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,923
I don't believe
in fate, Cheryl.

513
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:14,796
But I do believe in
your ability to be
a master manipulator.

514
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,277
Hush, Toni.

515
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,410
And follow me, I have
a super-surprise.

516
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:38,864
A gift to you
and your little one.

517
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:40,387
A nursery.

518
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,215
Cheryl, what the hell
is this?

519
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:44,260
A place where
we can be together.

520
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:47,002
With or without
Kevin and Fangs.

521
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:49,222
Depending on whether
or not they survive
the night's festivities.

522
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:51,615
So is this why
you threw a key party?

523
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,182
So you could
hurt Kevin and Fangs?

524
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:57,099
To show you how fragile
some unions can be, yes.

525
00:29:57,143 --> 00:30:00,537
And to show you
a path forward.

526
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:03,932
Don't you see? All these years,
I've been compelled to work

527
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:07,893
on restoring Thornhill without
ever truly understanding why.

528
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,421
But now,
I see it so clearly.

529
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:21,080
It was to make a sanctuary
for your child, if not, ours.

530
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:23,125
Cheryl, you've got
to be kidding me.

531
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:26,737
I'm not bringing my baby
into this house of horrors.

532
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:29,871
The last two months,
all you've been trying to do
is draw me out of Thornhill.

533
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:32,569
Yeah, and as my reward,
you're trying to trap me here
like you did at Thistlehouse

534
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:34,571
with your
two dead brothers?

535
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:36,269
Well, it's not
going to work.

536
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:38,097
I'm done trying to bring you
down from the mountain.

537
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,926
I'm done trying to have
a normal friendship with you.

538
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,102
That was my mistake.

539
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:46,540
I should have just left
our relationship where
it belongs. In the past.

540
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:50,631
Look, I'm sorry I led you on.
And I'm sorry I agreed
to this stupid party.

541
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,286
I really, really am.

542
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:00,597
So how long have you
and Fangs been together?

543
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,471
Coming up
on eight years.

544
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,255
-Open for the last three.
-Hm.

545
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,909
But that door's closing,
I hear.

546
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:09,955
Yeah, it's been discussed.

547
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:12,871
Well, I'm rooting
for you guys.

548
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:16,700
I mean, I don't really
know you, but Fogarty,

549
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:19,442
man, he's a keeper.
He'll make a great dad too.

550
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:26,623
Rick, did Fangs
ever mention me
when he was with you?

551
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:30,714
Not really.

552
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:33,239
Then again, it might have
been awkward, considering
the context, you know?

553
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:36,503
Yeah, yeah,
that makes sense.

554
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,725
[Tabitha] All right, okay.

555
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:44,076
Whoops, okay. [laughing]

556
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:49,429
Oh...

557
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:52,040
I think the world
turned sideways
for a minute there.

558
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:55,087
Yeah, it does
that sometimes.

559
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,742
Tabitha, you think I actually
had a close encounter or...

560
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:02,398
I don't know.

561
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:06,228
But I do think that there is
something from your past

562
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:09,101
that you are trying
to avoid dealing with.

563
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:14,802
You know something with those
blackouts back in New York.
Some friendly advice.

564
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:17,500
You should talk to someone,
like a therapist

565
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:21,983
who specializes
in cases of trauma.

566
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:24,638
[exhales sharply]
Yeah, maybe you're right.

567
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,253
But, for tonight...

568
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:34,648
just...

569
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:37,259
sleep.

570
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:39,566
[snoring]

571
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:41,524
All right.

572
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:42,699
[door closes]

573
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:53,580
-You're home.
-Mmm-hmm, yeah.

574
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:58,324
Turns out Reggie
is 100% straight.

575
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:03,372
-Who'd you
get paired with?
-Rick.

576
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,286
Mmm.

577
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:07,376
Nothing happened, but...

578
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,992
Fangs,

579
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:14,949
I gotta tell you something.

580
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:21,695
I love you so much,

581
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:26,569
but I'm not ready
to get married.

582
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,397
[Fogarty] What?

583
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:32,532
Why?

584
00:33:35,187 --> 00:33:37,319
Because you don't
want to give up
cruising in the woods.

585
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:40,235
Okay, so don't,
that's fine.

586
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,454
It's not about
the woods.

587
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:44,805
Uh, it's about me.

588
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,634
Where I'm at.

589
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:49,462
Where you're at.
[laughs sarcastically]

590
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:51,812
What about Toni?

591
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,597
Hmm?

592
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:57,078
What about the fact
that we're having
a baby together?

593
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,168
I'm not sure yet.

594
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:03,476
Kevin, why are you
imploding us?

595
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,090
Especially when you pushed
for all of this. Being open,

596
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:12,789
starting a family,
getting married.

597
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:16,315
Yeah, it's messed up.

598
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:18,926
[Kevin] I know, I know.
I'm so messed up.

599
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,971
I'm, I'm...

600
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:21,929
I'm just sorry.

601
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:23,713
I'm sorry.

602
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,978
-[Betty] <i>Here we are.
-[door slams]</i>

603
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:32,853
With a free pass
to do whatever we want.
So, why aren't we?

604
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:35,160
I think 'cause we're
right on the edge.

605
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,512
That's what
it feels like, yeah.

606
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,084
Betty,

607
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:52,351
before we do anything,
I have to be honest
with you.

608
00:34:58,226 --> 00:35:00,010
I, uh...

609
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:01,969
I still have feelings
for Veronica.

610
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:06,495
I shouldn't, but I do.

611
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:10,630
Shouldn't?

612
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:18,159
Archie, you and I
should make sense.

613
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,946
The all-American boy,
the girl next door.

614
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,604
But deep in our cores,
we are such different people.

615
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,523
And getting closer to you,

616
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:37,700
the one thing I know is that
I don't want my darkness
to overtake you.

617
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,876
Betty.

618
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,443
And don't
get me wrong.

619
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:46,796
It's been saving my sanity
to escape with you.

620
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,236
But what's coming next with
my mom and Polly is probably
going to be the darkest thing

621
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,153
I've ever faced.

622
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:58,156
So, you get to face
whatever's coming alone?

623
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,161
-No way.
-No

624
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:06,251
[sniffles]

625
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:07,208
Not alone.

626
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:10,429
Still with you,

627
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:12,996
as a friend,

628
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:18,350
because that's what
I think I'm going to need.

629
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:24,573
More than a lover,
more than an escape.

630
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,098
A friend.

631
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:35,367
A window of light
in the dark.

632
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,374
And that's what I'll be.

633
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:50,425
Did you invite
me here specifically
to make me jealous?

634
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:55,778
-To humiliate me?
-[sighs] Neither.

635
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:58,564
But I really did think it was
time to stop playing games,

636
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:01,175
and avoiding the truth.

637
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:07,790
As ill-advised as Cheryl's
party was tonight,

638
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:11,403
it confirmed something
I've been feeling
for a really long time, Chad.

639
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:13,056
[suspenseful music playing]

640
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:29,203
[intense music playing]

641
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:33,076
[panting]

642
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:41,520
[Minerva] <i>It's sublime, Cheryl.</i>

643
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:47,395
Thank you, Minerva.
Considering so much
of my life is sheer ugliness,

644
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:48,701
I'm relieved

645
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:51,007
-you think so.
-Oh, Cheryl...

646
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:53,793
You made me beautiful
because you're beautiful.

647
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:55,577
No, I'm not.

648
00:37:56,578 --> 00:37:58,972
I'm repulsive.

649
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:01,714
No. Cheryl,
you are...

650
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:03,716
You're gorgeous.

651
00:38:09,243 --> 00:38:10,766
[pleasant music playing]

652
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:31,352
Hey.

653
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:37,315
I went by your house, but Eric
told me you were on duty the
next couple of nights, so...

654
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:39,969
Yeah. Serves me right
for starting a fire department.

655
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:45,888
Archie...

656
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,897
Chad and I are
getting a divorce.

657
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:59,424
He's on his way
back to New York for good.

658
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:04,211
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

659
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,823
I think,

660
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:11,914
in my heart of hearts,
I knew it had to happen.

661
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:14,961
You know, I was devastated
when I found out
you were married.

662
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:19,357
But that was nothing

663
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,750
like the pain I felt
seeing you unhappy.

664
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:27,190
More than anything,
Ronnie, I just...
I want you to be happy.

665
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:32,282
Good.

666
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:36,417
Because I might know
a way that you can
help me with that.

667
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:37,418
Wait, I...

668
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:41,683
I need to tell
you something.

669
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:45,165
Betty and I,

670
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:48,386
we didn't hook up after
the key party, but we...

671
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:51,389
we have hooked up a few times
since we got back to Riverdale.

672
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:54,957
I wondered about that.

673
00:39:56,742 --> 00:40:00,659
What was it? Just two
lost lonely souls

674
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:03,183
-looking for a connection?
-Something like that.

675
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:07,405
We're just friends
is the truth.

676
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:09,972
