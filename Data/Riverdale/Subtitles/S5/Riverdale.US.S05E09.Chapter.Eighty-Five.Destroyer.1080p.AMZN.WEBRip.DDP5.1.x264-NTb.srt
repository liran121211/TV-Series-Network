1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,200
The science fiction writer
Arthur C. Clarke

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,680
said this about aliens,

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,160
"Two possibilities exist.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,200
Either, we are alone
in the universe

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,600
or we're not.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,730
-Both are equally terrifying."

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,820
Mom, come on.
It's almost time for the game.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,090
Polly's out there, Mom.

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,580
We don't even know if that was
her blood on the phone booth.

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,190
She called us
from that booth a half hour
before we got there.

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,620
Who else's blood would it be?

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,930
We'll find out
when the FBI calls me back

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,280
with their analysis.

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,370
Maybe you should get back
into your support group

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,420
with all of those other moms.

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,650
All right. Bring it in.

17
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,310
We lost again.

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,010
We totally could've been
practicing for regionals,

19
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,750
instead of wasting
our time here.

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,970
I couldn't agree more,
Cassandra.

21
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,850
Could not agree more.

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,640
All right, guys,
that was another tough one.

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,770
But the Baxter High Ravens
are number two in the league.

24
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,420
You guys fought hard out there.

25
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,640
Keep fighting. We're gonna
break through. All right?

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,820
While I do believe
Coach Andrews

27
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,780
is the best motivator
a Gridiron Gang could ask for,

28
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,130
as your de facto team owner,

29
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,220
what can I do
to incentivize you?

30
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,440
How about ten grand

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,610
to whichever Bulldog
scores first this season?

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,490
All right?

33
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,800
You okay, Derek?

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,150
I'll be all right.

35
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,190
It just sucks to lose, Coach.

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,320
I'm giving it my all.

37
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,200
I hear you, man.

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,850
There was
no better player than you
out on that field today.

39
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,860
Seriously,
what do we do?

40
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,860
Push them more?

41
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,820
I'm already
running them ragged.

42
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,990
Not to mention,
there's zero fan support.

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,300
The Bulldogs were supposed
to inspire the town

44
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,690
and Riverdale was supposed
to rally behind the Bulldogs,

45
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,220
but no one even comes
to our games.

46
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,910
In that case,

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,090
I'll get the town to back
our Bulldogs again.

48
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,180
You just keep those kids
motivated, Coach.

49
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,790
What about me?

50
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,880
Don't coaches
need motivation too?

51
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,190
Chin up, Andrews.

52
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,110
And the incidents,
they go back decades, Samm.

53
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,110
There's dozens of people
seeing things
they can't explain.

54
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,550
There's even support groups.

55
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,770
Slow down, Jones.

56
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,250
You're writing
about aliens now?

57
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,900
Yeah, but it's
not just about aliens.

58
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,770
It's about personal trauma.

59
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,210
And if I'm right,
it's about a town's
collective trauma.

60
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,340
Could you please just take
the idea to Scribners?

61
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,340
Y-Yeah, I'll let you know
what they say.

62
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,780
Thank you. I appreciate it.

63
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,440
Tabitha.

64
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,140
How do you feel about Pop's
hosting a pancake breakfast

65
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,620
so that folks
can mix and mingle

66
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,450
with the new and improved
Riverdale Bulldogs?

67
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,930
Sounds fun.

68
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,630
And if it brings in
warm bodies, then great.

69
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,280
Amazing!

70
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,890
And what if, hypothetically,

71
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,070
Pop's became
the official sponsor

72
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,940
of the Bulldogs?

73
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,900
Let's give it a shot.

74
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,900
I like supporting underdogs.

75
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,080
I will express order
the pancake mix and the syrup.

76
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,640
Oh, no. No.
Don't order the syrup.

77
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,430
I have
a special supplier for that.

78
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,080
I'm sorry, but I cannot donate
my precious maple resource

79
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,260
to help fund that collection
of tatterdemalions

80
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,260
you call
a football team, Archie.

81
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,960
Moreover,
the Vixens can no longer,
in good conscience,

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,830
continue cheering for
the bad news Bulldogs.

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,090
Cheryl, please.

84
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,750
Just stick around
for one more game

85
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,400
and maybe help get
some more people in the stands.

86
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,450
My Vixens are cheerleaders,
not boosters, Archie.

87
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,490
Fine. I'll do it myself.

88
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,580
Hi, Ms. Bell

89
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,630
Can you turn this on, please?

90
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,330
Attention, everyone.
This is Coach Andrews.

91
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,420
You may not know this,
but a bunch of your classmates

92
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,420
are out there
busting their asses
on the football field

93
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,860
to represent this school

94
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,420
and to represent
each and every one of you.

95
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,030
So why don't you all
show some school spirit

96
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,510
and support your team.

97
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,650
Starting with...

98
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,690
the free pancake breakfast

99
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,300
that Pop's is hosting
tomorrow morning.

100
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,960
Give them your support.
And, hell...

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,830
you might even get something
out of it yourselves.

102
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,050
And what about the Vixens?

103
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,050
One more game.

104
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,010
I'll even come out
of retirement

105
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,140
to give the people something
they'd actually like to see.

106
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,670
Namely, moi.

107
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,330
But first,
there's something broken
I need to fix.

108
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,900
Don't forget to turn in
your short story assignments

109
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,070
on the way out, guys.

110
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,210
Thank you.

111
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,510
Good job. Thank you.

112
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,100
Glen.

113
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,800
Did you get the blood results
from the phone booth back?

114
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,670
I did.

115
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,670
The recovered blood
is AB-negative.

116
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,200
The rarest type.

117
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,020
Under one percent
of the population.

118
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,680
And a match for Polly.

119
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,250
So, she... She's really...

120
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,730
I'm so sorry, Betty.

121
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,300
No, you're not.

122
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,430
If you had cared at all
about me or my sister,

123
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,780
you would have done something
to help me.

124
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,390
Betty, look,
I realize you're upset--

125
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,570
Screw you, Glen.

126
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,580
I must admit,

127
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,450
it is a bit disturbing.

128
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,280
Waldo, a kid is held captive
by mole people.

129
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,420
Only to escape

130
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,640
and be abducted by
a family of mothmen

131
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,770
who operate on him
in a spaceship,

132
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,160
in graphic detail.

133
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,730
Doesn't it ring
any alarm bells for you?

134
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,600
But the child survives.

135
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,560
He's found on the side
of the highway.

136
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,080
What do we know about Lerman?

137
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,170
Well, he's a good student,
average grades.

138
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,960
Is there any trouble at home?

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,830
He has sustained
a substantial number
of injuries.

140
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,180
A broken arm, a black eye,

141
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,480
was on crutches for a while.

142
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,920
I know what you're thinking,
Mr. Jones,

143
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,320
but I spoke to Lerman
and his parents.

144
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,670
They couldn't be nicer people.

145
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,100
So what?
He's just accident prone?

146
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,370
And then what about this story?

147
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,280
Some kids get hurt a lot.

148
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,200
And, yes...

149
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,200
sometimes a story
is just a story.

150
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,550
Order up.

151
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,690
Behold. 'Tis the nectar
of the gods.

152
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,650
Amazing!
Thank you again.

153
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,480
Enjoy.

154
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Thank you.

155
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,780
We're feeling optimistic
about the rest of the season,
Mrs. Davis.

156
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,220
And your son plays
a huge part in that.

157
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,960
Which is why, Derek,

158
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,700
-I want you to be
captain of the team.

159
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,880
And what's the team gonna do
for my son, Coach Andrews?

160
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,530
Uh, I'm not sure I understand.

161
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,840
Derek's a damn good player.

162
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,360
And football could be
his ticket out of this town.

163
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,370
-He could get a scholarship--
-Mom, chill!

164
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,540
I have to think
of my son's future, Coach.

165
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,020
Not just your team's.

166
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Excuse me.

167
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,640
No, I understand.

168
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,990
So sorry to interrupt.

169
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,380
Coach, we have a situation.

170
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,000
I take it you didn't come
for the hotcakes, Reginald?

171
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,700
No.

172
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,530
I'm here on behalf of

173
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,880
the Greater Rockland County
High School Football League.

174
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,750
The eight other teams
in the conference

175
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,880
and our commissioner saw fit
to send me as a representative.

176
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,010
We're all in agreement.

177
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,580
We'd like for the Bulldogs

178
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,410
to withdraw from the league
like... yesterday.

179
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,020
You guys, uh, suck.

180
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,460
Screw you, Reggie.

181
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,070
Riverdale has a right to play.

182
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,370
Come on, Andrews.
The Bulldogs are
an embarrassment.

183
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,550
They're tainting
the league's prestige.

184
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,730
So, can we tell the league
you're withdrawing?

185
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,600
Like hell.

186
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,210
I want the names
of every member of
this so-called league.

187
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,740
Doesn't it kill you, Coach?

188
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,910
To watch the Bulldogs
lose week after week.

189
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,440
Yeah. Well, it's not
all about winning, Reg.

190
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,480
Keep telling
yourself that, loser.

191
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,490
Loser. Loser. Loser.

192
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,890
Y-You want to talk about it?

193
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,420
A few days ago,
you were getting married
and having a kid,

194
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,590
and now, uh...
Now we're moving you out.

195
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,030
It was my decision, you know.

196
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,300
Maybe you're right, Dad.
Maybe...

197
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,860
I'm not the kind of guy
who deserves a family.

198
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,820
Hold on, now.

199
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,650
You, you don't really believe

200
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,690
that you don't deserve
happiness now, do you?

201
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,610
You know what, Dad,
I actually don't want
to talk about it.

202
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,920
Given how invested you are

203
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,750
in seeing Riverdale High fail
on all fronts,

204
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,270
I find it hard to believe
you're not behind

205
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,150
the league's attempt
to oust the Bulldogs.

206
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,980
All I know about the Bulldogs
is that they're garbage

207
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,110
and that they haven't even
scored this season.

208
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,460
They will against
your precious Stallions.

209
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,160
Oh, please.

210
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,330
We'll be wiping Bulldog blood
off our cleats for weeks.

211
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,810
You seem so sure.

212
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,770
How about a wager?

213
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,120
Ooh. What are the terms?

214
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,650
If your Stallions

215
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,820
keep my Bulldogs
off the scoreboard,

216
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,650
we'll withdraw
from the league, voluntarily.

217
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,700
If, however, we do score,

218
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,960
you'll have to convince
your good friend,

219
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,360
the commissioner,
and his legion of doom,

220
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,660
to stop trying
to muscle out the Bulldogs.

221
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,400
I will take that bet.

222
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,670
Great.

223
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,030
Hey, Lerman.
Could you hang back for a sec?

224
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,650
Story is great.

225
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,040
It's very vivid, it's intense.

226
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,350
I wanted to ask you
what inspired it.

227
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,520
Uh, just a series
of dreams I had.

228
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,830
Really? Recurring?

229
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,350
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

230
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,180
Now some experts believe that

231
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,190
stories about aliens
and the like

232
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,840
are really about traumas
that people have experienced

233
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,800
and that these stories
are cries for help.

234
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,720
What? What do you...
What do you mean?

235
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,240
I mean,
is this story real, Lerman?

236
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,370
Any part of it?

237
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,380
Did someone hurt you?

238
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,730
Like what you wrote about

239
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,770
or tie you up,
or keep you locked up?

240
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,680
Mr. Jones...

241
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,910
it's just a story. Okay?

242
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,080
I...
I never should've
written it. I'm sorry.

243
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,910
Sorry. I have to go.

244
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,480
Sweet cousin,
what a surprise.

245
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,310
Any news on your fair sister?

246
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,620
Yeah. As a matter of fact,

247
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,320
that's why I'm here, Cheryl.

248
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,500
When Jason first disappeared,

249
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,500
for a long time,
no one knew where he was

250
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,110
or what had happened to him.

251
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,900
But when you learned
that he had died,

252
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,720
was it helpful
to know the truth?

253
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,770
To say it was soul-crushing

254
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,210
would be an understatement.

255
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,830
So what if you'd never
learned the truth?

256
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,390
If you had had hope
that he might still be alive?

257
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,830
When I learned the truth,

258
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,270
I was able to grieve
for my brother.

259
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:01,620
From my experience,
it is better to know the truth

260
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,360
and make your peace with it.

261
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,720
Does this mean Polly's...

262
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,600
I don't know what
it's gonna do to my mom.

263
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,350
What's going on?

264
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,050
Why aren't you guys
dressed for practice?

265
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,350
Derek transferred.

266
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,830
He got recruited to play
for Stonewall Prep.

267
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,310
We're doomed.

268
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,710
As much as
I hate Stonewall Prep,

269
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,410
I can't blame Derek.

270
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,410
Enrolling there,
playing for the Stallions.

271
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,370
It's his best shot at college.

272
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,900
And they're a team
that wins games.

273
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,380
The Bulldogs will be, too.

274
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,250
You've only
just re-launched them.

275
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,690
Not to mention,
we're down a player.

276
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,600
The league won't even let us
on the field with ten.

277
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,690
It seems to me
like the Bulldogs

278
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,350
just need a little motivation.

279
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,260
Something to
get them energized.

280
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,920
Luckily...

281
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,010
I just came up
with one of my genius ideas

282
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,360
that will rally the troops

283
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,750
and maybe even
recruit some new ones.

284
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Mom.

285
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,510
Mom.

286
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,250
We got the blood results back.

287
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,560
Is it Polly's?

288
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,170
No.

289
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,750
No, it was O-positive.

290
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,830
It wasn't a match.

291
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,800
Oh, thank God!

292
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,150
Thank God!

293
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,720
Oh, thank you, Betty.

294
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,170
Hey, you're awake.

295
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,650
Perfect timing.

296
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,960
I ordered a platter
of cold cuts from Pop's.

297
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,310
Would you mind running
to get it?

298
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,960
What's happening?

299
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,790
Oh, I decided
you were right about me

300
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,450
getting back into
the support group.
I'm hosting today.

301
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,060
Would you mind running
to get the cold cuts?

302
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,190
Yeah. No. Of course.

303
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,760
What's the buzz, Waldo?

304
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,800
It was him?

305
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,020
Mr. Jones,
these are the Logans.

306
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,460
Lerman's parents.

307
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,460
Oh, hi.

308
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,810
They've come in to discuss
a conversation you had
with their son.

309
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,210
In what world, Mr. Jones,

310
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,730
do you think
that it's appropriate

311
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,650
to encourage
these wild fantasies

312
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,000
that Lerman is obsessed with?

313
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,740
Death and aliens
and underground monsters?

314
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,130
What's wrong with you?

315
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, I'm sorry.

316
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,010
I'd figured
it was my responsibility
as Lerman's teacher.

317
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,050
The story he wrote...

318
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,050
might've been alluding
to some troubles at home.

319
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,400
Then why didn't you come to us?

320
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,400
Instead, you ambush our child?

321
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,320
Mr. and Mrs. Logan,

322
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,240
Mr. Jones' behavior
was wildly inappropriate.

323
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,760
But I can promise you
that it will never
happen again.

324
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,500
Oh, we know it won't,

325
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,940
because we don't want him
teaching our child.

326
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,200
Now, wait.
I didn't reach out to your so--

327
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,590
Not a problem at all.

328
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,200
We'll move Lerman
to another English class.

329
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,510
How dare you break protocol
in such a reckless manner!

330
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,690
I told you, I had already
vetted the Logans.

331
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,910
I know. No. I'm sorry. I...

332
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,740
I felt like something was off.

333
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,870
My instinct was telling me
something strange was going on.

334
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,780
One more misstep...

335
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,610
I mean,
even just a little one...

336
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,140
and you're done at my school.

337
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,620
Kevin. Fangs.

338
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,400
Thank you both for agreeing
to this tete-a-tete.

339
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,880
Toni may never forgive me,

340
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,100
but I will never forgive myself

341
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,370
if I don't try to repair

342
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,240
what my antics
have torn asunder.

343
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,110
Namely, hashtag Kangs.

344
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,980
Your games brought up
deeper issues between
Kevin and I.

345
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,290
-Agreed.
-See? Consensus.

346
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,070
Go on, Fangs.

347
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,080
You've never been all in,
Kevin.

348
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,380
Y-You've always,
always held back.

349
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,210
And I don't know
if that's because of me

350
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,390
or if it's because
you're ashamed of being gay.

351
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,560
I am not ashamed
of being gay.

352
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,960
Dude, you go to the woods,

353
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,910
you hook up
with anonymous strangers.

354
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,000
You don't want to be
in a real relationship

355
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,090
with a real gay guy.

356
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,700
Fangs, don't.

357
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,790
You're not me.

358
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,790
You don't know
my experience, okay?

359
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,270
We were about
to get married, Kevin.

360
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,930
I want to know
everything about you,

361
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,150
the good and the bad.

362
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,020
I think it's too late for that.

363
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,980
-Kevin, please.
I gotta go.

364
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,460
Cheryl, please butt out
of our lives.

365
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,160
What? Are you having a party

366
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,120
and I wasn't invited?

367
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,030
No. Um, it's for
my mom's support group.

368
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,650
How's she doing?

369
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,830
there've been... developments

370
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,780
in Polly's case.

371
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,440
Um, apparently,

372
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,620
the blood they recovered

373
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,660
at the phone booth

374
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,530
is a match for hers.

375
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,970
Which means
most likely that, um...

376
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,280
Oh, God. Betty, I'm so sorry.

377
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,630
And the worst part is,
she disappeared four weeks ago,

378
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,160
which means she has
or had been alive

379
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,330
that entire time,

380
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,200
somewhere along
the Lonely Highway.

381
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,810
So I just didn't do enough.

382
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,820
Hey, I actually met
someone that lives on
the Lonely Highway.

383
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,340
I mean,
he's kind of an eccentric kook,

384
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,000
but he sees a lot of
what goes on out there.

385
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,300
Maybe he might've seen
or heard something
about the missing girls.

386
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,700
If you want,
I can put this tray on ice,
and I can...

387
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,920
take you to go meet him.

388
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,180
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

389
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,190
All right. Bring it in.

390
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,930
What's the point
in practicing, Coach?

391
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,930
We don't even have
enough players anymore.

392
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,670
Bulldogs are a team, Britta.

393
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,670
We play for each other
and for the love of the game.

394
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,930
Yoo-hoo! Got room for one more?

395
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,500
Bulldogs, I wanna introduce you
to a friend of mine

396
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,240
who plays professional football

397
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,420
for a little team
called the New York Goliaths.

398
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,330
-Holy crap!

399
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380
It's T Dub!

400
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,250
Wow! It's a pleasure
to meet you, bro.

401
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,430
You're one hell of a player.

402
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,120
Oh, man. I appreciate it.

403
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,560
Heard you're one hell
of a coach.

404
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,130
How are you even here?

405
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,690
Ronnie and I go way back.

406
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,960
T Dub was one of
my most loyal clients

407
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,870
when I was selling jewelry
in New York.

408
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Hey. Uh, is it cool
if I say a few words
to the team?

409
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,270
Yeah, please.

410
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,230
Some of you might've seen me
play for the Goliaths,

411
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,580
but my career started off
in a small town
just like Riverdale,

412
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,840
with a coach who pushed me
to be what I could be.

413
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,630
He believed in me.

414
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,540
Just like Coach Andrews
believes in you.

415
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,370
But you gotta be the ones
to make it happen on the field.

416
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,370
You're not underdogs.

417
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,720
You're the damn Bulldogs!

418
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,250
Yeah!

419
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,250
Y'all ready to prove
these haters wrong?

420
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,900
Yeah!

421
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,900
You must be Britta.

422
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,990
Heard you got a cannon.

423
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,470
Come on. Let's see.

424
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,300
This might be the shot
in the arm we needed, Ronnie.

425
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,830
I just wish T Dub
could suit up for us.
We're still short a player.

426
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,000
Oh, Archiekins, not for long.

427
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,440
Behold, a group
of Bulldogs-to-be.

428
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,410
Hey...

429
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,980
-who wants to play football?

430
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,150
We have a problem.

431
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,980
The interest in the Bulldogs

432
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,410
is growing, not waning.

433
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,590
I do not want people

434
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,290
rallying around this team
or that school

435
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,860
or that town.

436
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,340
I want you to target
their weakest link

437
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,990
and knock some heads.

438
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,950
We don't need to go there.

439
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,520
We're still gonna
crush the Bulldogs

440
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,950
on the field
fair and square. Easy.

441
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,130
Your loyalty lies with me.
At Stonewall.

442
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,870
Yeah, but I'm not gonna
break some kid's legs
for no reason.

443
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,700
Yeah.

444
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,190
Consider yourself benched,
Reggie.

445
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,360
I'll be leading Stallions
into battle against
Riverdale High.

446
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,670
So be it.

447
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,670
I'll be standing
with the Bulldogs, then.

448
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,160
What were you doing
out here?

449
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,510
Just working on a book.

450
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,640
So, the old-timer
that owns this place

451
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,210
has been here for decades.

452
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,390
Mr. Dreyfuss, hi.

453
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,040
-Jughead Jones,
you remember me?
-'Course I do.

454
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,870
Great. This is Betty Cooper.

455
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,180
She's a friend of mine,
from the FBI.

456
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,350
-We were hoping that you could
help us with an investigation.
-Come on up.

457
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,700
We're
one hundred percent certain

458
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,920
that my sister made a call
from the payphone

459
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,360
on the Lonely Highway.

460
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,930
But when we got there,
it was destroyed.

461
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,710
Shredded? Like a tin can?

462
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,020
Exactly, yeah.

463
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,500
Have you seen that before?

464
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,240
Back in the summer of '77.

465
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,020
And again in '82.

466
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,850
I know what happened
to your sister.

467
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,510
She's had an encounter.

468
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,860
Yes, right.
But... But with who?

469
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,730
The mothmen.

470
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,730
I'm sorry. The mothmen?

471
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,390
What makes you say that?

472
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,040
The phone booth.

473
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,520
You see,

474
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,700
their ships use
anti-matter fusion reactors

475
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,530
that create
a gravity field that, uh,

476
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,450
that allows them to levitate,
like, like a balloon.

477
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,410
But anything that gets caught
in that stasis,

478
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,150
well, it gets crushed,
like it's made
out of papier-mache.

479
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,110
I knew our friends
were back in town.

480
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,810
I've been pickin' up
their chatter on my radios.

481
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,290
That was a colossal
waste of time.

482
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,640
Look, a lot of people
believe this stuff.
And there is some evidence.

483
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,430
My sister went missing, Jug.

484
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,430
She was taken by someone.
Not some thing.

485
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,600
What are you even saying?

486
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,300
I'm saying that things happen,

487
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,820
especially in Riverdale,
that you and I can't explain.

488
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,830
Sometimes, there isn't
a logical explanation.

489
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,790
-Sometimes,
unexplained phenomenon--
-No, someone is...

490
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,490
kidnapping, torturing,
and murdering women,

491
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,310
that's not a phenomenon.

492
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,010
It's just pure evil.

493
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,270
But I'll be damned if I let it
happen to anyone else.

494
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,970
Can you hurry up?
I need to get back
to Riverdale.

495
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,640
Because I care about you.

496
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,470
You don't live here.

497
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,040
You deserted us.

498
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,480
Okay, being a real sister

499
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,130
doesn't mean coming in
for one day and telling me
how to live my life.

500
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,180
Especially when you don't know anything about it.

501
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,220
My daughter is alive!

502
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,700
-She called--
Betty, you
have to help me.

503
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,970
I don't know,
I ran as fast as I could.
You have to come get me.

504
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,400
Polly, I wanna tell you
that I love you,

505
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,970
and that I'm here for you,

506
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,410
just please, please,
please come home.

507
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,190
Hey, how's it going?

508
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,880
Good, good.

509
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,540
I haven't seen you
in here before.

510
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,190
My name's Shane.
I'm visiting from LA.

511
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Ah. Well...

512
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,680
I guess it's true
what they say about LA guys.

513
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,420
Oh, what's that?

514
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,730
That they're... hot.

515
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,990
And what to they say
about guys from Riverdale?

516
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,170
Why don't you tell me?

517
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,740
-What the hell are you doing?
-Oh.

518
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,220
Uh, I'm sorry.

519
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,870
I must've misread
the situation. I thought--

520
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,700
-You thought I was like you?
-No.

521
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,620
-You thought I wanted you?
-No.

522
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,230
You think I came here
to be groped
by your pathetic ass.

523
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,320
No, no--

524
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,480
-What the hell?
-Hey! What are you doing?

525
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,270
Saving your life,
whether you want it
saved or not.

526
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,960
Get the hell out of here.

527
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,100
You're leaving
these girls alone,

528
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,930
and you're never
coming back here again.

529
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,930
Hey, these girls are the ones
looking to trick.

530
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,280
Tell your dirtbag friends

531
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,150
the party's over.

532
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,640
Put a little ice on it.

533
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,640
These bruises will settle down
in a few days.

534
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,730
You keep those cuts clean.

535
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,000
-Thanks, Dad.
-You're a grown man.

536
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,050
And as your father...

537
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,270
I'm terrified for you
right now.

538
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,660
What's going on, son?

539
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,010
I think...

540
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,020
I'm ashamed of myself...

541
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,540
of being gay.

542
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,720
Is this something
that... that I did?

543
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,720
No.

544
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,330
No, Dad. No.

545
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,990
It isn't your fault, okay?

546
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,210
You've... you've always
accepted me.

547
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,900
You've never judged me.

548
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,870
-But, Mom--
-What? What happened?

549
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,870
There was this one time...

550
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,530
we were
back-to-school shopping.

551
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,180
And she made

552
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,620
some offhand comment.

553
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,230
Like, about needing
to buy me...

554
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,410
husky clothes.

555
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,550
I don't know.

556
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,030
Man, I just felt...

557
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,810
like, so ashamed.

558
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,080
So, I, uh...

559
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,740
I told her I was meeting Betty.

560
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,300
And I went to Fox Forest...
to be alone.

561
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,400
I didn't even know
it was a cruising spot.

562
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,400
And there was this
other guy there,

563
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,790
and he was telling me
I was cute...

564
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,930
or whatever.

565
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,670
And it was like...

566
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,630
all the stuff Mom said,
just washed away.

567
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,290
And ever since then,
I... I've been cruising.

568
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,900
It's like I'm hardwired
this way,

569
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,120
or something.

570
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,690
I don't know.

571
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,670
Get out. Now.

572
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,850
You--

573
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,460
-You're not Patty.
-No, I'm her sister.

574
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,290
You can't do this.
You can't arrest me again.

575
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,290
You let me go.
You got nothing on me.

576
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,160
You're right, John.

577
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,030
I'm not gonna arrest you.

578
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,380
But you are coming with me.

579
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,310
Waldo, what's going on?

580
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,660
Jughead, is Lerman with you?

581
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,960
What?

582
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,660
No, definitely not.

583
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,400
I've been steering clear
with him. Why?

584
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,840
His parents just called me.
They think Lerman ran away.

585
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,400
Any idea where he might be?

586
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,020
Oh, God, no.
I haven't talked to him.

587
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,370
Tell the Logans that I'm
calling in some help, okay?

588
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,330
Come on.

589
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,020
Please don't do this.

590
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,600
I told you.
I don't know where Patty is.

591
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,510
What? Why are you doing this?

592
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,730
-You really
have to ask me that?

593
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,220
You are still preying

594
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,610
on these girls.

595
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,220
Exactly the same way

596
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,390
you preyed on Polly.

597
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,790
I have a family.

598
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,750
I had a sister.

599
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,540
No one looked out
for those girls.

600
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,370
No one was protecting them.

601
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,800
I couldn't even protect Polly.

602
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,160
But I can deliver justice.

603
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,960
-Jughead?
-Betty. Hey,
this is an emergency.

604
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,140
One of my student is missing,
and I think
he's on the Lonely Highway.

605
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,100
I'm on the highway.

606
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,580
I'm ten miles north of town.

607
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,450
I'm leaving
from town right now.
I'll meet you halfway.

608
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,540
-Who is it?
-Lerman Logan, he's 14.

609
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,110
I'm on my way.

610
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,470
I'll send someone
to come untie you tomorrow.

611
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,950
If I remember.

612
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,260
Here are
the Stonewall Stallions

613
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,830
versus the Riverdale Bulldogs.

614
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,310
Let's go.

615
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,660
Go. Go.

616
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,810
Lerman. Thank God.

617
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,340
Yeah, he was walking
on the shoulder in a daze.

618
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,340
You okay, bud?

619
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,610
Mr. Jones...

620
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,260
did it happen again?

621
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,140
Thank you
for finding Lerman.

622
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,140
We'd hoped you wouldn't
have to go through this again.

623
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,010
-Again?
-Yeah, Lerman is a sleepwalker.

624
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,150
Has been since he was little.

625
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,500
We thought he grew out of it,
but, uh...

626
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,760
then he started
hurting himself.

627
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,670
He walked into a door.

628
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,160
Another time,
he burned his hand
on the stove.

629
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,850
Even fell out of a window once
and broke his arm.

630
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,730
So, we started locking
his bedroom door at night.

631
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,860
Now, we gave him
the whole basement
to himself.

632
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,080
We just... We made sure
he was safe.

633
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,690
So you were the "Mole People"
who were keeping him locked up.

634
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,340
All we've done is try our best
to protect him.

635
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,430
I remember we were so terrified

636
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,090
after that morning
we found the front door open

637
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,570
and, and...

638
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,180
Lerman was just gone.

639
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,620
That whole week,
we thought we lost my boy.

640
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,930
No, wait. He left
in the middle of the night
and was missing for a week?

641
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,060
Where did he go?
What happened to him?

642
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,500
A good Samaritan
found him wandering
the Lonely Highway...

643
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,930
with no memory
of the prior week.

644
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,630
That's why we were so upset
with you, Mr. Jones.

645
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,240
We thought your questioning
might trigger...

646
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,070
Well, something
like this happening.

647
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,950
God only knows
what draws him to that highway.

648
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,080
I don't think
it's a coincidence, Jug.

649
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,220
Polly and Lerman both end up
on the Lonely Highway? No way.

650
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,440
I agree. But what are
the other connections?

651
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,960
When Polly escaped
and made that phone call,

652
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,620
my mom said,
she described being in

653
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,790
what sounded like
an alien spaceship.

654
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,670
Seriously?

655
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,450
They could've been abducted
by the same person.

656
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,580
Why would they keep Polly
but let Lerman go?

657
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,930
Well, maybe he escaped.

658
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,240
Which is why
we need to find out

659
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,150
what Lerman knows
about that missing week.

660
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,020
Yeah, we're going to have to
exhaust every possible option

661
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,940
no matter how insane
it might seem.

Look at me.

688
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,420
Hey, look at me. Don't worry
about the scoreboard.

689
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,600
I don't care what it says.
You guys are playing
with heart.

690
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,940
You're leaving it
all out there.

691
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,550
That is all I could ever
ask from you.

692
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,640
But listen,

693
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,430
this is your moment.

694
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,910
The whole town is behind you.

695
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,170
The people in those stands
are here for you!

696
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,390
Your teammates
are here for you!

697
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,910
I'm here for you!

698
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,910
And we're not gonna give up
on each other.

699
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,480
If you don't give up
on yourself,

700
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,920
then guess what?

701
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,610
You can't lose.

702
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,400
If you don't give up
on yourself,
you cannot lose.

703
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,270
This game is not over.

Let's make this a night
we'll remember forever.

706
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,280
This game is not over.
Come on, bring it in.

707
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,760
-Britta, on you.
-Bulldogs, on three!

708
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,670

something happen. Come on!

Archie!

734
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,870
Heck of a game, Coach.

735
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,870
Yeah? What game
were you watching?

736
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,050
Well, the Bulldogs
may not have triumphed
on the scoreboard,

737
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,700
but I'd say we've started
to win over the hearts
and minds of the town.

738
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,140
And thanks
to a little side wager
with my father,

739
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,100
the rest of the league
will no longer demand
that we withdraw.

740
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,930
Ronnie for the win.

741
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,890
I, just, uh...

742
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,890
I just wanted to say,
good game, Coach.

743
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,070
Hey. Thanks, Derek.
You played great out there.

744
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,330
What do you think, Ronnie?
Kid's got wheels, huh?

745
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,940
He sure does.

746
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,160
Just remember. Keep working.
Keep getting better.

747
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,210
I promise I will, Coach.
Just like you taught me.

748
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,960
Waldo, this is becoming
sort of a regular thing
for us?

749
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,260
So it seems.

750
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,090
But I just wanted
to let you know

751
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,660
that Lerman's parents
have pulled him out of school.

752
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,570
They've left Riverdale.

753
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,580
My God. Where'd they go?

754
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,360
They left me a message,
but no forwarding address

755
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,580
or contact information.

756
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,410
I suppose they wanted
a fresh start.

757
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,800
Yeah. Don't we all?

758
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,600
Hey, what's wrong?

759
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,900
Agent Cooper.

760
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,000
Glen, what's going on?

761
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,480
I came to check on you.

762
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,350
Why is my mom upset?

763
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,610
Because you...
You lied to me.

764
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,880
Elizabeth, you made me
feel like she might
still be out there.

765
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,970
That there might still be hope!

766
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,400
You told your mother
that the blood
in the phone booth

767
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,140
wasn't a match
for your sister's?

768
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:21,320
Mom,
I'm so sorry.
-Don't.

769
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,410
How could you? How dare you!

770
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,550
I can't imagine
what you must be going through,
Mrs. Cooper.

771
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,550
But I want you to know that
I will be personally
taking over this case.

772
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:35,810
No. I'm working
this case, Glen.
This is my sister!

773
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,860
I'll make sure that this
investigation is handled
thoroughly, by the book.

774
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,300
I'll leave no stone unturned.
