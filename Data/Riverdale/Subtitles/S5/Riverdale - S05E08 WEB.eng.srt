1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,677
A lot can happen in seven years.

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,016
But in Riverdale,
the more things change...

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,269
Oh, that was... That was hot, yeah.

4
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,813
...the more they stay exactly the same.

5
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:24,024
Hey. I'm Rick.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,610
- What's your name?
- Come on. No names.

7
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,363
- See you.
- Yeah.

8
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,162
- Hello.
- Hey.

9
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,164
Hey, babe. How was the store?

10
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,374
I had to go to a couple different places,

11
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,210
but I got regular milk,
oat milk, almond milk

12
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:48,840
- and two varieties of sugary cereals.
- You're the best, Kev.

13
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,177
- Sorry about all these crazy cravings.
- It's all good.

14
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,846
- Are you okay?
- Totally.

15
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,225
You're not nervous
about the big announcements?

16
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,935
Not at all. Why would I be?

17
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,355
- Okay, you ready?
- I'm ready.

18
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,571
Wow. I was so not ready.

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,160
Yeah, what do you think?

20
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,788
I think you've come a long way

21
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,749
from when you were 8
and said you wanted to be a firefighter.

22
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,803
Thanks for coming to meet us,
Dr. Whitley.

23
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:38,807
You mentioned having a specimen
that needed examining. May I see it?

24
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,229
It's the damnedest thing, doc.
Someone stole it.

25
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,108
I was babysitting it and then...

26
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:53,988
Suddenly,
this blinding light appeared in the sky.

27
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,157
Last thing I remember
I was looking up at it,

28
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,201
but then I lost several hours.

29
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,703
- Next thing I knew, the Mothman mummy...
- The specimen.

30
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,748
The specimen was gone.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,671
Mr. Jones, I'm an anthropologist

32
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,090
with an interest
in extraterrestrial phenomena,

33
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,092
not a psychologist.

34
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,928
But in the majority of cases
like you're describing,

35
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,764
when a person claims
to have had a close encounter,

36
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:24,811
they are, in fact,
often repressing a traumatic experience.

37
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:28,815
You said in the majority of cases.
What about the other ones?

38
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,276
In the other cases,
I believe they're telling the truth.

39
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:36,322
If you'd like, I can perhaps help you
determine what you're dealing with here,

40
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,116
truth or repression.

41
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,704
- There's a support group I lead...
- We're sorry for making you drive

42
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,415
from your university,
but I don't need a support group.

43
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,627
If I am repressing something,
I think I'd prefer to keep it repressed.

44
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,008
Should you decide otherwise,
here's my card.

45
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,552
Just in case. You take care.

46
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:08,646
Juniper, Dagwood,
this artwork is so beautiful.

47
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,524
Your mom's gonna love this
when she gets home.

48
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,526
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mom.

49
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,907
Hey, Mr. Keller. Everything okay?

50
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,870
Okay. I'll be right there.

51
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,038
What is it?

52
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,708
- They found another body in Swedlow Swamp.
- Another one?

53
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,084
But is it Polly?

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,794
No.

55
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,381
Tom says it looks like the other bodies,
like it's been there for a while.

56
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,009
- Call me the second you know?
- Okay. I love you.

57
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,093
Love you too.

58
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,474
- Your lats are looking huge.
- Thanks. Trying to keep up with you.

59
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,729
Fangs, we should talk about stuff.

60
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,565
Us. Before things get crazy.

61
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,444
I know we've been
in an open relationship and...

62
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,072
That was when I was on the road, mostly.

63
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,618
But now things are different. I get it.

64
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,247
And I wanna be monogamous too.

65
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,333
Also, I'm seeing
what we're about to do as...

66
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,837
As a fresh start for the both of us.

67
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,464
A clean slate.

68
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,677
And I hope you do too.

69
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,476
Hey, Mom. It's not her. It's not Polly.

70
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,436
Are you sure?

71
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,980
A hundred percent.

72
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,649
Dr. Curdle says
the remains are over a year old.

73
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,733
Oh, thank God.

74
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,569
Your sister's still out there.

75
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,197
It means she's still alive.
Don't you think?

76
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,281
Hopefully.

77
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,909
I love you, Mom.

78
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,160
Hang in there, okay?

79
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,339
Not now, Chad.

80
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,596
Clear the decks, Smithers.
We're starting our remodel ASAP.

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,432
Oh, very good, Ms. Veronica.

82
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,059
I can assemble
a list of contractors for you.

83
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,646
Oh, that won't be necessary.
I already hired my contractor.

84
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,108
What do you wanna have done
to your apartment?

85
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:21,195
One word, demolition.
I want it all torn out, down to the studs.

86
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,613
That's a big job.

87
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,909
But, yeah, I think my buddy Eric
would be up for helping out.

88
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,788
- What's your timeline?
- I want it done yesterday.

89
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,627
I need changes in my life, Archie.
Big changes.

90
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,755
How big are we talking about?

91
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,840
That's very cool.

92
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,136
What is this, plans for your
very own Shangri-la, Veronica?

93
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,931
- It'll be the new and improved Pembrooke.
- Looks swanky, Vee.

94
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,225
Hey.

95
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,353
Hey.

96
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,939
The Four Musketeers.

97
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,942
Pray tell, whyfor have we been summoned?

98
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:05,073
Hey, guys. Um, thanks for gathering
on such short notice.

99
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,201
Um, Fangs and I have an announcement.

100
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,286
- We're engaged.
- Oh, my God!

101
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,038
That's such good news.

102
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:15,458
- But wait, there is more.
- Yeah, we're having a baby.

103
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,793
Guys, that's great.

104
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,253
Wait, there's still more.

105
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,464
We're having the baby.

106
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,592
With me. I'm having our baby.

107
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,512
We're planning on raising
this child together, the three of us.

108
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,223
As one big, happy, non-traditional family.

109
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,684
What in the actual...?

110
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,488
And they call me Cherry Bombshell.

111
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,532
Cheryl. Good.

112
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,535
I wanted to talk to you about
stepping back from the Vixens.

113
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,788
Did it not occur to you
to give me any advance warning

114
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,373
about your offspring's lineage?

115
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,793
Well, to be honest, Cheryl,
I wanted to tell you.

116
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,879
Not just as my co-captain
but as my friend.

117
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,007
But, based on your recent behavior,

118
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,802
I didn't even know
if we had that relationship anymore.

119
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,096
Did this idea originate with Kevin or...?

120
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,347
Me, Cheryl.

121
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,061
When I was a junior in Highsmith College,

122
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,148
I found out that I have
a medical condition

123
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,401
that makes it hard for me
to get pregnant the older I am.

124
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,782
Toni, I had no idea.

125
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,492
I'm so sorry.

126
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:35,288
Anyways, the doctors said
that if I really wanna have kids,

127
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,665
I need to while I'm young.

128
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,916
Okay.

129
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,878
But Kevin and Fangs?

130
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,838
Fangs is like family to me.

131
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,966
We got initiated
into the Serpents together.

132
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,261
And when Fangs and Kevin
started talking about adoption

133
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,931
or looking for a surrogate mother,
I volunteered.

134
00:07:55,892 --> 00:08:00,813
Splendid. You've got an insta-family
while I'm withering away at Thornhill.

135
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,232
I'm having a baby with Kevin and Fangs.

136
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,278
But I still care about you deeply, and...

137
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,158
if you want, maybe we can still try
and make this work.

138
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,913
I don't see how that's possible anymore.

139
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,834
But congratulations.
I'm very happy for you.

140
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,297
It's funny, I always figured

141
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,299
the first baby would be
yours and Jughead's

142
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,177
or Archie and Veronica's.
How times change, I guess.

143
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,638
Yeah, you're not kidding.

144
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,015
That sounded loaded. What gives?

145
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,977
You have to keep it a secret, okay?

146
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,439
Oh, God. Don't tell me you and Jughead
are getting back together.

147
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,066
No. It's...

148
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,943
It's me and Archie.

149
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,614
We've been doing this
"casual friends with benefits" thing.

150
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,242
- Shut the front door.
- Yeah. It's an...

151
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:59,163
It's an escape, and we're in this bubble
and I don't want it to burst.

152
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,791
I also don't wanna get in
too deep with him.

153
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,875
Why?

154
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,171
Because Archie's this lit window
in the dark.

155
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,757
And I don't want that light
to ever go out.

156
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,094
The importance of sight.

157
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,348
The way we see the world
or how we interpret what happens

158
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,767
is one of the biggest themes
in Slaughterhouse-Five.

159
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,019
Now, Billy has "discovered" the truth.

160
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:26,816
And that's why he can, at any one point,
be at his daughter's wedding,

161
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,568
be fighting the Germans,

162
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:32,280
or he can be millions of light-years away
as a captive in some alien zoo.

163
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,702
Billy has "achieved" true sight.
Or at least that's one interpretation.

164
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,791
Mr. Jones?

165
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,042
Mr. Jones?

166
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,211
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

167
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,175
- What was I saying?
- That there was another interpretation.

168
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,677
Yes.

169
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,138
That Billy is crazy.

170
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,687
Hi, Dr. Whitley?

171
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,816
Yeah, it's Jughead Jones.
Sorry to bother you.

172
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,862
Upon further consideration, I might
be interested in joining that group.

173
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,408
Making progress?
Or are you too distracted by my beauty?

174
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,077
I'm painting you
as Diana with Actaeon, the stag.

175
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,079
You'll find it satisfactory.

176
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,916
You have a unique talent.
I recognized it right away.

177
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,586
I had to have a Cheryl Blossom.

178
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,213
Once this painting is finished,
will you leave me in peace?

179
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,258
I haven't decided yet.

180
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,302
Oh, who cares?

181
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,888
After the dagger
my beloved Toni stuck in my heart,

182
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,807
- what does anything else matter?
- Go on.

183
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,603
She lured me out of the house,
where I feel safe,

184
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,897
just to torture me with her happiness.

185
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,983
It's cruel. Don't you think?

186
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,194
As an outsider,

187
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,530
it seems to me that fate has put
an obstacle before you.

188
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,492
This Toni person's happiness.

189
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:03,204
And you must either rise above it or...

190
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,707
Throw a little chaos at it.

191
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,259
Katy Keene. How are you, girl?

192
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,637
Oh, my God, girl, I am reeling.

193
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,348
So I'm having lunch
with Francois in the Lacy's café

194
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,393
and who strolls in with the heiress
to the Spiffany's fortune?

195
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,395
Chad. Your Chad.

196
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,814
What the hell is going on with you two?

197
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,943
Well, clearly,
he's trying to make me jealous.

198
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,279
Totally. Which means I'm about
to pour hot coffee into his lap.

199
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,572
Perfect.

200
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,868
And I, Katy Keene,
will be fighting fire with fire.

201
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,751
Wow. You boys made some real progress.
Well done.

202
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,212
Oh, you know what we should do?

203
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,841
Document our reno journey.
Let me get between you two.

204
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,009
Come on.

205
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,681
Perfection.

206
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,350
Now flex for my followers.

207
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,482
Is yours from Cheryl too?

208
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,026
She wants us to gather
at the Whyte Wyrm for drinks.

209
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,155
Well, shall we, boys? I'm buying.

210
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,121
I thought
you had a thing going with Betty.

211
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,998
That's just a casual thing.

212
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,168
Okay, but what about Veronica?

213
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,545
The looks, the smiles, the banter...

214
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,505
Dude, she's married, Jackson.

215
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,634
Sarge juggling two ladies...

216
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,263
Cheryl, what's this about?

217
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:48,559
I wanted to apologize
for being so cuckoo to you earlier.

218
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,645
- Will you let me have a do-over?
- Of course, Cheryl.

219
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,482
Your support means the world to me.

220
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,649
So...

221
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:00,738
will you let me host a modest celebration
for you, Kevin and Fangs?

222
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,449
Okay. Sure.

223
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,784
Amaze.

224
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,959
Hear ye, hear ye,
fellow friends and fiends.

225
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,171
Now that everyone is swan-diving
into sad adulthood

226
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:21,175
with babies and marriages
and arthritis, et cetera,

227
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,927
I'm throwing a party.

228
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,430
One last hurrah to celebrate
our wild, misspent youth.

229
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:30,601
One final chance to recall
our reckless teenage selves.

230
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,104
Who could forget my iconic
spin-the-bottle parties of yore?

231
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,731
Aren't we a little old for that?

232
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,735
Which is why this little fete
will be a key party.

233
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,904
You heard me right.

234
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,074
A classic American and oh-so-adult round

235
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,408
of sexual switcheroo.

236
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,204
We'll draw keys, pair off,
and if the spirit moves you,

237
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:54,500
you are strongly encouraged to act on any

238
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,044
and all animal impulses.

239
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,760
I'm texting you the "deets" now,
but bring keys for my bowl

240
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,848
and your well-oiled libidos.

241
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,985
Oh, my God.

242
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,071
Polly. When did you get back?
Does Mom even know...?

243
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,949
- No, you can't be here. He'll find you.
- What? Who will?

244
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,034
- TBK.
- What?

245
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,288
You shouldn't have gone in alone.

246
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,586
Oh, my God.

247
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,354
Good thing your mom still leaves
that spare key under the gnome.

248
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,814
Beats climbing the trellis.

249
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,570
What's wrong?

250
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,407
Just a nightmare.

251
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,495
I don't wanna talk about it.
I just wanna forget. Okay?

252
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,747
Yeah.

253
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,458
Whatever you want.

254
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,846
Nice spread, sarge.
And you're up before me. Not bad.

255
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,891
I haven't gone to bed yet.
I was over at Betty's.

256
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,853
Shut up, Jackson.

257
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:43,192
I thought it was gonna be a booty call,
which I was more than fine with...

258
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,031
but this time it felt different.
It didn't feel great.

259
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,575
And if I'm being completely honest...

260
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,702
you were right.

261
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,789
About me and Veronica.

262
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,875
I would never do anything about it...

263
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,880
but there's something still there.

264
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,594
So about Cheryl's party, I was thinking,

265
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,389
it's one last night
of carefree abandon, right?

266
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,518
What if you brought one of your
hot trucker beaus to spice things up?

267
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,853
You must have a regular hookup, right?

268
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,355
Yeah. Maybe.

269
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,274
But why would I do that?

270
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,486
We just closed our relationship,
like, yesterday.

271
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:31,240
I've always been curious about
the company you keep on the road

272
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,660
and you've never brought
a friend home, per our rules.

273
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,037
Yeah, exactly.

274
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,415
So why now?

275
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,167
- What's going on with you?
- Nothing.

276
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,422
But before we become husbands and fathers,

277
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:51,927
let's get every horndog impulse
out of our systems, once and for all.

278
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,638
No strings, no guilt.

279
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,390
No secrets.

280
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,356
Betty. Oh, thank God.

281
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,692
Your sister. She called. She's alive.

282
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,737
What? When? Are you sure it was Polly?

283
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,698
Of course I'm sure. I know the sound
of my own daughter's voice.

284
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,075
- What did she say? Walk me through it.
- Okay.

285
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,496
Um, the phone rang. The landline.
I picked up, and it was Polly.

286
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,000
She was hysterical.
She was talking a mile a minute.

287
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,295
Um, I tried to keep her on the phone,
but she was scared.

288
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,882
Mom, are you sure
it wasn't just some crank?

289
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,799
Yes!

290
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,176
She was scared.

291
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,596
Uh, she couldn't see anything.
She was being kept somewhere.

292
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,766
It was dark. Everything was cold
and smooth, like metal.

293
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,601
It sounded like a spaceship.

294
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,897
In most missing persons cases,
after two days,

295
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,817
the chances of a victim being
found alive are almost nothing, Mom.

296
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,195
Polly's been gone for weeks.

297
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,905
No. You know what? No.

298
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,701
My daughter is alive!
She called, and she's calling back.

299
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,873
The lights were as bright as the sun,
hovering a few hundred feet above me.

300
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,666
That was the last thing I remember.

301
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,586
Woke up six hours later
by the side of the Lost Highway.

302
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,714
- No idea how I got there.
- Thanks for sharing, Bill.

303
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,094
Mr. Jones, didn't you have an experience
similar to the one described?

304
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,100
Uh, I was working late.

305
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,311
The diner was empty. Jukebox was playing.

306
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,482
And then things just kind of got crazy.

307
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:32,361
There were these lights
from outside the window.

308
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,532
They were so bright that I should
have been blinded, but then I...

309
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,078
Were you missing time too?

310
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,665
Yeah, I mean, I probably just fell asleep.

311
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,959
Blackouts are fairly common

312
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,962
during supposed encounters
with extraterrestrials.

313
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,089
Have you
ever blacked out before?

314
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,307
Jughead. You okay?

315
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,435
Uh, no, sorry. This was a mistake. Sorry.

316
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,565
Jughead!

317
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,901
Jughead!

318
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:22,619
I've been through enough in my life
to know when someone hits a nerve.

319
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,122
About something real.

320
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,171
I have blacked out. I didn't wanna talk
about it in front of strangers.

321
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,254
Okay.

322
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,884
Well, it's just me now.

323
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,264
When did it happen?

324
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,730
I was in New York City.

325
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,234
I was going pretty hard.

326
00:19:55,152 --> 00:20:00,073
I was drinking a lot and partying
and doing drugs and jingle-jangle.

327
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,450
Some harder stuff.

328
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,535
And I, uh...

329
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,999
I just did some things
I don't even remember.

330
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,003
I lost a lot of time.

331
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,216
Look, maybe you shouldn't go
to Cheryl's tonight.

332
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:23,055
We could go to a movie instead or,
I don't know, hang out.

333
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:27,059
No, I think a night at Cheryl's house
with some wanton debauchery

334
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,270
is what I need
to forget about all this alien crap.

335
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,152
Veronica Lodge, spreading plaster...

336
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:44,785
Since my jewelry store remains
closed tragically, I'm happy to help.

337
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,620
Where's Eric?

338
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,498
He ran down to the VA
to collect his disability.

339
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,999
Seems like a nice guy.

340
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,419
How'd he lose his leg?

341
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,589
On our last mission.

342
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,509
You'll never hear him complain.

343
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,469
The strong and silent type.

344
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,098
Sounds like somebody
I used to know back in the day.

345
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,857
So how about Kevin
and Fangs and Toni's announcement?

346
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,941
Yeah.

347
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,112
Sort of makes you take stock
of your own life, doesn't it?

348
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,326
I'm starting to realize
all the things I'm missing in my life.

349
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,622
And am I crazy or...

350
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,085
have you been feeling the same way too?

351
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,089
I'm not sure what I'm feeling.

352
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,010
Things are changing. Fast.

353
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,683
What happens
if we get matched at the key party?

354
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,229
I honestly don't know. Is Chad coming?

355
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,403
Yes, he is, as a matter of fact.
He should be on the train right now.

356
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,616
Good. I think that's a good thing.

357
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,409
Yeah, me too.

358
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,091
Keys, please.

359
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,428
- Where's the booze?
- Bar's in the gallery.

360
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,305
Hi.

361
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,352
Oh, good. Reginald, you got my message.

362
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,435
Welcome.

363
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,150
Where's Fangs?

364
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,362
Um, he is a bringing a date, I guess.

365
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,448
- One of his "cazh" hookups.
- Okay.

366
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,076
- It was my idea.
- Okay, why?

367
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,077
I don't know.

368
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,956
Maybe because I wanted to see
what he's giving up for me.

369
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
To get married.

370
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:01,588
Or maybe because I wanted to see if he'd
go through with it and bring someone.

371
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,763
Or maybe because I am
an emotional masochist.

372
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,306
Oh, Kev.

373
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,944
Archie Andrews.

374
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,487
Chad Gekko.

375
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,446
You made it.

376
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,490
Tell me, bro to bro,

377
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,202
how is it that in a Podunk town
like Riverdale,

378
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,454
all the females are so...

379
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,540
smoking hot?

380
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,757
Oh, my God.
Fangs' date is my cruising crush.

381
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,717
- Hey, Betty.
- Hi, Fangs.

382
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,430
Betty, Kevin,
this is my friend Rick. We, uh...

383
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,391
We both drive rigs along the same route.

384
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,436
- It's nice to meet you. Both.
- Nice to meet you.

385
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,479
Likewise.

386
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,357
Anyone care for a drink?

387
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,151
I'm buying.

388
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,072
- I see we have a surprise guest.
- Yes.

389
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,242
Seems like your ex's rather handsome
baby-daddy's brought a friend.

390
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,579
Oh, well. If he's collateral damage,

391
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,414
- then so be it.
- Hm.

392
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,959
Shall we gather everyone?
It's time for some party games.

393
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,004
You're here.

394
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,380
You came.

395
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,175
Which means you all feel it.

396
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,845
The impending crush of true adulthood.

397
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,889
Our 30s.

398
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,141
And soon after...

399
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,850
mortality.

400
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,936
The big sleep.

401
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,815
Tonight's key party, then,
is a bold rejection of death.

402
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,569
Since none of us are much for foreplay,
let's get into it. Shall we?

403
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,363
Some house rules, first and foremost,

404
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:54,576
whatever happens tonight
must be 100% consensual.

405
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,080
And because we are all a progressive,
fluid-inclusive group,

406
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,625
there will be no redrawing of keys.

407
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,918
But the main rule...

408
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,506
is you're allowed to do anything
you and your partner desire.

409
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,591
No one can hold you accountable.

410
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,761
It's a free pass to do anything
you've ever wanted.

411
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,261
Ever.

412
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,141
Are we clear? Perf.

413
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,519
Who wants to go first?

414
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,895
Minerva, the bowl.

415
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,445
I never like to be the second person
to do anything, so...

416
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:51,174
You know what they say,
everyone's a winner in a bull market.

417
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,676
No.

418
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,387
Not with your ex.

419
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,307
Chadwick, don't be rude.
Those are the rules, okay?

420
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,393
Get your hands off her.

421
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:03,936
Excuse me?

422
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,439
- She's my wife.
- Exactly.

423
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,026
- Why don't you show her some respect?
- We're not gonna do this.

424
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,489
I'm not gonna be some passive heroine
to be fought over by two Tarzans.

425
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,119
Oh, look. I got Chad's key.

426
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,954
Come on. We're leaving now.

427
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,539
Veto. That's breaking the rules.

428
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,542
Call my lawyer, Cheryl. Are you ready?

429
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,006
Fine. Always good to knock
a few pieces off the chessboard.

430
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,883
And married people are supremely boring.

431
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,678
- Who's next?
- I'll go.

432
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,603
I'll take him home.

433
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,482
No one else is leaving
without picking a key.

434
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,444
I don't care how inebriated Jughead is,
he has to draw.

435
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,821
No, no. I want to. Let me do it.

436
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,078
Ah. Those are my keys.
I guess it's meant to be.

437
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,538
Now can I take him home?

438
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,500
Whatever. Get this American Pickle
the hell out of my sight.

439
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,962
- Charming as ever, Cheryl.
- Come on, Jones. Party's over.

440
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,508
You're next, soldier boy.

441
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,554
- You mean me?
- Get up here, G.I. Jackson.

442
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,680
Do your duty.

443
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,733
Those are mine.

444
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,904
- How good are you at following orders?
- No one better.

445
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,450
Before the pickings get too slim...

446
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,170
- Toni?
- Nope. Guess again.

447
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,463
Actually...

448
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,674
those are mine.

449
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,261
Are you down with this?

450
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,139
It's no fun if you leave
with the guy you came with, right?

451
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,223
Agreed.

452
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,189
No promises but we'll see what happens.

453
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,530
On that note...

454
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,578
Imagine that.

455
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,418
Figured you'd end up at our house
one way or another.

456
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:38,091
I'm still traumatized
from spin the bottle, sophomore year.

457
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,969
Cry me a river, cousin.

458
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,686
Perf. Bye.

459
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,608
Well, well...

460
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,238
Looks like fate has brought us
together yet again, Antoinette.

461
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,325
How did I know this was gonna happen?

462
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,623
Destiny has manifested. I could feel it.

463
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,334
After making this night all about you,

464
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,420
I knew we would end up together.

465
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,547
I don't believe in fate, Cheryl.

466
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:22,010
But I do believe in your ability
to be a master manipulator.

467
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,928
Hush, Toni.

468
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,554
And follow me.

469
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,724
I have a super surprise.

470
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,575
A gift to you and your little one.

471
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,078
- A nursery.
- Cheryl, what the hell is this?

472
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,414
A place where we can be together.

473
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,416
With or without Kevin and Fangs.

474
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,377
Depending on whether
they survive the festivities.

475
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,173
So is this why you threw a key party?
To hurt Kevin and Fangs?

476
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:04,219
To show you how fragile
some unions can be, yes.

477
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,013
And to show you a path forward.

478
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,182
Don't you see?

479
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,143
All these years,
I've been compelled to restore Thornhill

480
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,313
without ever truly understanding why.

481
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,777
But... now I see it so clearly.

482
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:25,031
It was to make a sanctuary for your child.

483
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,909
If not... ours.

484
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,869
You've gotta be kidding me.

485
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,039
I'm not bringing my baby
into this house of horrors.

486
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,126
All you've been trying to do
is draw me out of Thornhill.

487
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,087
And as my reward, you try to trap me here

488
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,881
like you did at Thistlehouse
with your two dead brothers?

489
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,260
It's not gonna work. I'm done trying
to bring you down from the mountain.

490
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,054
I'm done trying to have
a normal friendship with you.

491
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,138
That was my mistake.

492
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:53,351
I should have just left our relationship
where it belongs, in the past.

493
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,937
Look, I'm sorry I led you on,

494
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,106
and I'm sorry
I agreed to this stupid party.

495
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,358
Really, really am.

496
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,241
So how long have you
and Fangs been together?

497
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,954
Coming up on eight years.
Open for the last three.

498
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,666
- Hmm. That door's closing, I hear.
- Yeah. It's been discussed.

499
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,335
Well, I'm rooting for you guys.

500
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,047
I mean, I don't really know you
but Fogarty?

501
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,885
Man, he's a keeper.
He'll make a great dad too.

502
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,636
Rick...

503
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,933
did Fangs ever mention me?
When he was with you?

504
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,602
Not really.

505
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,940
It might have been awkward,
considering the context.

506
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,027
Yeah, that makes sense.

507
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,364
All right. Okay.

508
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,492
Oops. Okay.

509
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,042
I think the world turned sideways
for a minute there.

510
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,836
Yeah, it does that sometimes.

511
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,337
Tabitha,

512
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,049
you think I had a close encounter?

513
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,010
I don't know.

514
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,222
But I do think that there is
something from your past

515
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,142
that you are trying to avoid dealing with.

516
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:19,354
Something with those blackouts
back in New York.

517
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:23,232
Some friendly advice:
You should talk to someone.

518
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:28,363
Like a therapist
who specializes in cases of trauma.

519
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,281
Yeah.

520
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,241
Maybe you're right.

521
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,623
But for tonight...

522
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,085
just...

523
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,586
sleep.

524
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,006
All right.

525
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,519
- You're home.
- Mm-hm.

526
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,395
Yeah.

527
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,692
Turns out Reggie is 100% straight.

528
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,903
Who'd you get paired with?

529
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,280
- Rick.
- Mm.

530
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,784
Nothing happened, but...

531
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,330
Fangs...

532
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,500
I gotta tell you something.

533
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,253
Okay.

534
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,132
I love you so much.

535
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,886
But I'm not ready to get married.

536
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,804
What?

537
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,309
Why?

538
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,648
Because you don't wanna give up
cruising in the woods? Okay, so don't.

539
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,732
That's fine.

540
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,693
It's not about the woods.

541
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,113
Uh, it's about me.

542
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,239
Where I'm at.

543
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,534
Where you're at.

544
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,162
What about Toni?

545
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:04,375
Hmm? What about the fact
that we're having a baby together?

546
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,378
I... I'm not sure yet. I...

547
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,964
Kevin, why are you imploding us?

548
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,510
Especially when you pushed
for all of this.

549
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,764
Being open, starting a family.

550
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,016
Getting married.

551
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,477
Yeah. It's messed up.

552
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,147
I know. I know. So messed up.

553
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,690
I'm... I'm...

554
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,317
I'm just sorry.

555
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:30,984
I'm sorry.

556
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,321
Here we are.

557
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,785
With a free pass to do
whatever we want, so why aren't we?

558
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,747
I think because we're right on the edge.

559
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,001
That's what it feels like, yeah.

560
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,340
Betty...

561
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,680
before we do anything,
I have to be honest with you.

562
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,394
I, uh...

563
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,607
I still have feelings for Veronica.

564
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
I shouldn't,

565
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:13,985
but I do.

566
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,990
"Shouldn't."

567
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,623
Archie, you and I should make sense.

568
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,169
The all-American boy, the girl next door.

569
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,925
But deep in our cores,
we are such different people.

570
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,180
And getting closer to you,

571
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,934
the one thing I know is I don't want
my darkness to overtake you.

572
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
Betty...

573
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,813
Now, don't get me wrong.

574
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,858
It's been saving my sanity
to escape with you.

575
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,445
But what's coming next
with my mom and Polly

576
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,948
is probably gonna be the darkest thing...

577
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,534
I've ever faced.

578
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,538
So you get to face
whatever's coming alone?

579
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,709
No way.

580
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,792
No.

581
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,505
Not alone.

582
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,675
Still with you.

583
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,386
As a friend.

584
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,100
Because that's what I think
I'm gonna need.

585
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,521
More than... a lover.

586
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,981
More than an escape.

587
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,358
A friend.

588
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,783
A window of light in the dark.

589
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,124
Then that's what I'll be.

590
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,132
Did you invite me here to make me jealous?

591
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,885
To humiliate me?

592
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,385
Neither.

593
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,057
But I did think
it was time to stop playing games.

594
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,559
And avoiding the truth.

595
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:14,065
As ill-advised
as Cheryl's party was tonight,

596
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,736
it confirmed something I've been feeling
for a really long time.

597
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,307
It's sublime, Cheryl.

598
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,434
Thank you, Minerva.

599
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,522
Considering so much of my life
is sheer ugliness,

600
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,857
I'm relieved you think so.

601
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,817
No, Cheryl.

602
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,195
You made me beautiful
because you're beautiful.

603
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,863
No, I'm not.

604
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,117
I'm repulsive.

605
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,078
No. Cheryl, you are...

606
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,122
You're gorgeous.

607
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,480
- Hey.
- Hey.

608
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,318
I went by your house,

609
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,779
but Eric told me you were on duty
the next couple of nights, so...

610
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,199
Serves me right
for starting a fire department.

611
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,163
Archie...

612
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,423
Chad and I are getting a divorce.

613
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,011
He's on his way back to New York,
for good.

614
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,305
I'm sorry.

615
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,765
Don't be.

616
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:18,147
I think, in my heart of hearts,
I knew it had to happen.

617
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:22,443
I was devastated
when I found out you were married.

618
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,738
But that was nothing...

619
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,575
like the pain I felt seeing you unhappy.

620
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,413
More than anything,
I want you to be happy.

621
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,665
Good.

622
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,631
Because I might know a way
that you can help me with that.

623
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,714
Wait, I...

624
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,344
I need to tell you something.

625
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,596
Betty and I...

626
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,683
We didn't hook up
after the key party, but we...

627
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,479
We have hooked up a few times
since we got back to Riverdale.

628
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,400
I wondered about that.

629
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:09,407
What was it? Just two lost, lonely souls
looking for a connection?

630
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,699
Something like that.

631
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,954
We're just friends, is the truth.

632
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,415
I thought you should know.

633
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,625
The way I see it...

634
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,711
the past is in the past.

635
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,967
I'm only interested in...

636
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,970
what we want.

637
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,805
Now.

638
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:35,723
In the present.

639
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,503
Hello?

640
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,464
This is a collect call
for Alice Cooper.

641
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,591
- I'll accept the charges.
- Mom, are you there?

642
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,468
- Polly.
- Betty, you have to help me.

643
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,112
I'm at some pay phone
in the middle of nowhere.

644
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,638
- Where are you?
- I don't know. I ran as fast as I could.

645
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,307
Come get me. I'm on the highway.

646
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,350
- The Lonely Highway?
- It looks like it.

647
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,270
I'm gonna hang up,
call me back on my cell.

648
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,356
- Mom and I are about to get in the car.
- -Hurry. They're coming.

649
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,274
Wait. There.

650
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,235
There, Betty!

651
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:39,996
Polly!

652
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,000
Polly!
