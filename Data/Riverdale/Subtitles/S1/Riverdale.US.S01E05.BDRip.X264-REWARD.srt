00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:02,712
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,007
<i>The story is about a town,
once wholesome and innocent,</i>

3
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:09,302
<i>now forever changed
by the mysterious murder
of Jason Blossom</i>

4
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:10,679
<i>on the 4th of July.</i>

5
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:12,889
- Can we talk, Ms. Grundy?
- About what?

6
00:00:13,098 --> 00:00:14,683
<i>You're the music teacher.
Can we talk about music?</i>

7
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:16,309
Why does she need
to leave town?

8
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:18,103
Because it's what's best.

9
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:20,146
I'll pack up my things,
I'll be gone by morning.

10
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:23,441
It's the only piece
of property in my name
and not your father's.

11
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:25,986
- Can I
get you anything?
- A job.

12
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,446
I can't very well have
the wife of Hiram Lodge,

13
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:31,282
on trial for fraud
and embezzlement,
balancing my books.

14
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:32,409
Oh, Hiram...

15
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:34,619
Where's the rest of it?

16
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:36,705
I saw you with that biker guy.

17
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:39,499
Your father hired
the Southside Serpents.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,292
Nice murderboard, Dad.

19
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:44,587
Who did this?

20
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,638
<i>Every town has one.</i>

21
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:56,182
<i>The spooky house
that all the kids avoid.</i>

22
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:59,853
<i>Ours was Thornhill,
the Blossom family's mansion,</i>

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,980
<i>with its very own graveyard.</i>

24
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,566
<i>And, trapped within its walls</i>

25
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:07,986
<i>like some gothic heroine,
was Cheryl Blossom.</i>

26
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:11,114
<i>Still grieving for her
beloved brother, Jason.</i>

27
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:15,118
<i>Linked in death
even as they were in life.</i>

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,148
I told you, Cheryl.

29
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:48,526
No more sleeping
in Jason's bed.

30
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:51,863
I... I was
working on the eulogy.

31
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:53,907
- For Jay-Jay.
- Don't bother.

32
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:57,827
You won't be speaking
at his memorial.

33
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,582
God knows what you'd say.

34
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,502
Something to humiliate us?

35
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:12,467
No.

36
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,904
- Hey, Rocky.
- Hey.

37
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:36,449
You know, I never thought
I'd say that I miss you
playing guitar, but...

38
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:37,992
Ah. Sorry, Dad.

39
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,203
Just trying to get back
in fighting shape
for the field.

40
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:43,164
So, this is all for football?

41
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:46,501
Coach Clayton's about to set
the starting line-up,
name a new captain.

42
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:49,754
It's like you said.
Football gets me
a scholarship,

43
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:52,298
which gets me to college,
where I can study music.

44
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,718
Captains get scholarships.

45
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,940
This is how my dad
had his Jason Blossom
murder board

46
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:10,275
before it was trashed.

47
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,278
Any leads on who did that?
Or what they were looking for?

48
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,196
Nope. No fingerprints.

49
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:17,949
But they stole
a bunch of files,
background checks,

50
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,994
and all the video
and audiotapes
of police interviews.

51
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:24,706
Hey, Betty...

52
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,416
Trev, hi!

53
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,627
- Sorry to interrupt...
- Oh, no... Uh, it's okay.

54
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:32,672
- We're just, uh, working on...
- Our murder board.

55
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:40,305
Well, I just wanted to
make sure we're still
on for tomorrow?

56
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:41,764
Absolutely, it's a date.

57
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:46,352
I mean, I'll...
I'll see you there. Bye.

58
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,354
- So, I'll see you. Bye.
- So... Bye.

59
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,565
Going on a date with Trev?

60
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,609
Does Mama Cooper
know about that?

61
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,527
Kev, I'm not on house arrest.

62
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:59,741
Okay, she's out of town
at a Women in Journalism
spa retreat.

63
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,160
Anyway, it's not
a "date" date.

64
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:04,996
You just called it a date.

65
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:06,664
You literally said,
"It's a date."

66
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:08,333
That's just my cover.

67
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,085
Really, it's an intelligence
gathering mission.

68
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:14,797
We should focus on
the one thing we have access
to that your dad doesn't.

69
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,175
The kids at Riverdale High.

70
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,677
You know, maybe Trev knows
something about Jason
he didn't think was important.

71
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,203
Damn it!

72
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:50,959
Andrews...

73
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,254
What the hell was that?

74
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:58,800
Where were you, Andrews?

75
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:00,885
Because you weren't on
my field just now.

76
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:02,178
I'm sorry, Coach.

77
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:04,764
Mantle!

78
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:06,557
Sup, Coach?

79
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,601
You wanna be captain?

80
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,271
Hell yeah, I do.

81
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,817
Then this here is what we call
a horserace, fellas.

82
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:18,653
Now, you got a week to show me
who wants top spot more.

83
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:21,614
Good luck.

84
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:26,286
- Look, Reg...
- Save it, Andrews.

85
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:30,081
If anybody deserves
to be captain and wear
Jason's number, it's me.

86
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:31,833
Not you.

87
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:45,346
Your usual. Turkey on rye,
hold the tomatoes, to-go.

88
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:48,933
Great. Can I get
a huge cup of coffee to go?

89
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,436
I'm running on little
or no sleep.

90
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:53,896
Archie. Up all hours.

91
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:57,025
Listen, I was thinking maybe
we should take another stab

92
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,401
at going on a date.

93
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:00,778
So, what do you say?
Dinner?

94
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:07,869
Fred, um... I'm married.

95
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,538
And you are, too.

96
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,665
I'm... I'm confused here.

97
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:14,667
So, the drive-in...

98
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:17,628
That wasn't a date?

99
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:22,425
Totally my bad.
I gotta go.

100
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:24,969
Hey, Fred, wait.

101
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:26,763
It's all good.
I'll catch you later.

102
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:34,771
Betty, you're positively
radiating Nicholas Sparks.

103
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,647
Tell me everything
about this Trev.

104
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,149
Oh, there's nothing to tell.

105
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:41,235
Just one of Betty's sources,
there's nothing
romantic in the offing.

106
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:42,820
Why is everything weird here?

107
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,989
Why can't a date
just be a date?

108
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:48,326
What about you, Archie?
How's life in a PG world?

109
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:52,747
PG. Post-Grundy.
What, too soon?

110
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,209
Coach Clayton says
I have a shot at being
varsity captain.

111
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,753
So I'm not thinking about
anything else right now.

112
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,755
And you're back
to being boring.

113
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:04,592
Are you, maybe, throwing
yourself into football as
a way to avoid your feelings.

114
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:06,260
I'm not avoiding
anything, Betty,

115
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,137
I'm trying to get
my life back on track.

116
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,056
I can help with that.

117
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,682
I know Ms. Grundy
was tutoring you.

118
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,226
Understatement of the year.

119
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,020
But there's this
amazing songwriter
from New York,

120
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,855
who's an adjunct
at Carson College?

121
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,357
Incredible mentor.

122
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,692
He does some coaching
on the side
and I told him about you.

123
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:22,944
You wanna meet him?

124
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,279
Yeah, yeah I'd love to,
but football...

125
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,532
No, Archie can.
And he will.

126
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,493
Call him if you want,
but do it soon.

127
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,495
His spots fill up fast.

128
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:33,621
Thank you, Val.

129
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:40,711
Hey, now you have zero excuse
for avoiding music.

130
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,674
Sorry to interrupt
Sad Breakfast Club,

131
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:48,261
but I'm here to formally
invite you to Jason's memorial
at Thornhill this weekend.

132
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,892
To my surprise and chagrin,
mother added you
to the guest-list.

133
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:58,187
In case you're tempted
to steal our silver
candlesticks, don't.

134
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,856
We'll be searching bags.

135
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:06,863
Hey, try to remember,
she is burying her brother.

136
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,451
Cheryl, wait.

137
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,829
You're in pain.
This is a horrible week
for you.

138
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,789
I'm sure it's why
you're being
particularly obnoxious.

139
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:19,167
- Maybe. What's your point?
- Look, I don't want
to be locked

140
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,002
in a catfight-to-the-death
with you.

141
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,587
That only ends in one way.

142
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,213
Mutual annihilation.

143
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:27,300
- Agreed.
- So, can't we just...

144
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,887
Be friends?
Or, at least, frenemies?

145
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:33,806
If you really want to
extend an olive branch,

146
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,267
come to a sleepover
I'm having.

147
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,061
Fine.

148
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,938
Sure. When?

149
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,690
The night before the memorial.

150
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:47,737
I don't want to spend
the night before I bury
my brother alone.

151
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,560
Hi, Mr. Castillo?

152
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,979
Yeah, my name's
Archie Andrews.

153
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,439
I'm a friend of Valerie's.

154
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,662
Talk to me about your music.

155
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,498
I started writing songs
this summer, Mr. Castillo.

156
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,667
- Oscar.
- Oscar.

157
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,877
After this kid
at my school died.

158
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:46,754
It's his...
It's his funeral this week.

159
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:50,550
Actually, the first song
I wrote was about him.

160
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,051
How many hours a day
do you spend writing?

161
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,386
At least a couple.

162
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,471
That's going to
have to change.

163
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,515
I know. And it will.
Once football season's over.

164
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:58,724
Football season?

165
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,810
Yeah, I play...
I play football,
is that a problem?

166
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:01,811
You tell me.

167
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,106
Before I sold my first song,
I was in the studio all day.

168
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,358
Waitering and bartending
all night.

169
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:10,111
There's no short-cuts,
unless you're a prodigy.

170
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,655
Definitely not a prodigy.

171
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,450
Do you have any songs
I can hear?

172
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,952
Yeah, yeah.

173
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,789
Where are your sheets?

174
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:23,165
Your sheet music?

175
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,544
I don't teach performance.

176
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:29,213
I teach song writing.

177
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,716
I focus on craft,
composition, lyrics.

178
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,051
To even talk about your songs
in a constructive way,

179
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,553
we need to be
on the same page.

180
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,389
Like, on actual pages.

181
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:40,099
Okay, I'll write out
my songs.

182
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:41,225
For tomorrow.

183
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:42,810
Tomorrow?

184
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:52,445
Jason's memorial will be
held in this room.

185
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,030
Before he's laid to rest

186
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:56,616
in the cemetery
on Thornhill's grounds.

187
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:59,744
We've invited
everyone on our list.

188
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:01,245
What list is that?

189
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:03,039
List of suspects, of course.

190
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,292
People with
grudges against us,

191
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,086
many of them members of
Riverdale's founding families,

192
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,254
I'm sorry to say.

193
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,799
Someone in this town
killed Jason.

194
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:16,093
You know,
that's our thought, too.

195
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:17,637
Since whoever broke into
my house

196
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:18,971
knew that I'd be
at the drive-in.

197
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,516
Which means, there's
a very real possibility

198
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:25,436
Jason's murderer
will soon be in this room.

199
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,939
That's why you've invited
the Lodges and everyone else?

200
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,484
To investigate them?

201
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,447
And you think I'm manipulative
and heartless

202
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:38,282
and making this
all about myself?

203
00:11:44,664 --> 00:11:46,332
I think it's great
what you guys
are doing for Jason.

204
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,834
You two were on the
water polo team together.

205
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,586
Were you guys close?

206
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,673
This is just us talking,
right?

207
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:57,259
Just because, I kind of
feel guilty about it.

208
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,889
A few months ago,
Jason started acting all,

209
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,224
like, weird and secretive.

210
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,267
Do you know why?

211
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,355
I thought it was about
your sister, to be honest.

212
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,190
They'd been dating a few weeks
when he changed.

213
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,734
Changed in what way?

214
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:15,111
We stopped hanging out,

215
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,862
he wouldn't call me back,
and then...

216
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,365
Then he started selling off
all his stuff.

217
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,784
Anything he could
sell for cash,
he was hawking.

218
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:24,912
Then I heard he was
dealing drugs...

219
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:26,831
What drugs?

220
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,541
Weed, pills, whatever.

221
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:29,625
I don't know for sure,

222
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,085
because by then
he stopped talking to me.

223
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:35,673
And all this started
after Jason and Polly
got together?

224
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:49,061
Great. Now write it down.

225
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:52,356
Musical notation. Not in tabs.

226
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,943
It's kind of obnoxious,
but Oscar's right.

227
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,656
You catch on quick, newbie.

228
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:03,701
Hey son, time to...

229
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,536
Uh, hey.

230
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:07,371
Hi. I, uh...

231
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,373
I'm... I'm his old man.

232
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,208
- Yeah, I'm Fred.
- Dad, this is Val.

233
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:12,626
Val, my dad.

234
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:16,297
Val. Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Val. Valerie.

235
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,841
Right,
<i>Josie and the Pussycats.</i>
Oh, I'm a big fan.

236
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,469
I... Yeah, I saw you guys
at Taste of Riverdale.

237
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,345
And you were rocking hard.

238
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,055
Thanks, Mr. Andrews.

239
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,683
Actually, Dad,
we're in the middle of
some music stuff, so...

240
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:31,437
Oh, right. Yeah.

241
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,273
I'm gonna just close this,
not all the way.

242
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:36,233
Yeah, um...

243
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:37,902
Thanks, Dad. Goodbye.

244
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,707
Hey, good timing.

245
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,668
Why don't you grab
a wrench and tighten up
that hose for me?

246
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:00,633
Dad,

247
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:05,304
every time I ask Mom
about Polly,
she shuts me down.

248
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,726
Can we please talk about it?

249
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:13,938
What happened?

250
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,190
What did Jason do
that was so bad?

251
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:21,403
Jason and Polly had a fight.

252
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,116
I don't know
what it was about,

253
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,619
but afterwards,
Polly was pretty devastated.

254
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,415
And I came home from work
one day and I...

255
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:37,586
I heard the water running
in the bathroom upstairs.

256
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,631
I went upstairs,
I knocked on the door,

257
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,384
I asked if Polly
was all right, and...

258
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:46,554
She didn't say anything.

259
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,765
So I kicked the door down.

260
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,645
Polly was trying to
hurt herself, Betty.

261
00:14:56,856 --> 00:14:58,440
That's why we sent her away.

262
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,444
To stop her from trying to
take her own life again.

263
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,789
Betty, I'm sorry.

264
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,666
That's hardcore.

265
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,043
I asked my dad
if I could call Polly.

266
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,545
He said she was doing better.

267
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,715
But then, when she heard
about Jason's death,
she had a big setback.

268
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,718
He doesn't want to
risk another one.

269
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,469
Why does a rich kid
sell drugs?

270
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,513
He was running away
from his parents.

271
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,640
Yeah. Probably.

272
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,976
Or drug dealers.

273
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:36,520
Oh, my God.
Is that possible?

274
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,606
It's a theory.

275
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,441
Yours is more likely.

276
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,068
But why would he have
to run away from
mommy and daddy?

277
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,404
Because they're monsters.

278
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,948
Yeah, but why,
specifically.

279
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,367
Well, we can't exactly
just ask them.

280
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:52,786
So we have to ask Jason.

281
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:57,708
Are you proposing
a seance or...

282
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:00,294
No. Dead men tell no tales.

283
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,047
But their bedrooms,

284
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:05,633
their houses...

285
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,553
Bulldog twenty-five, on two.
Bulldog twenty-five, on two.

286
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:10,888
- Ready?
- Break!

287
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,777
Red 32. Red 32.

288
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:26,320
Ready?

289
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:28,322
Hut! Hut!

290
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,244
Other side. Go left.

291
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:44,922
Hut!

292
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,609
Well done, Andrews.
Great hustle.

293
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:09,822
Ah!

294
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,498
- What's wrong with your hand?
- Nothing. It's fine.

295
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,292
- You're not playing
with a busted hand.
- I said it's fine, Reg.

296
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,004
Archie, sit this one out,
you'll thank me later.

297
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,714
Are you really
that scared of me?

298
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,509
Fellas, are we going to
chit-chat or we going to play?

299
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:31,719
Let's play.

300
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,223
Okay. Fine,
it's your funeral.

301
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,077
Isn't this your playing hand?

302
00:17:58,662 --> 00:17:59,872
Archie.

303
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,874
This hand is your instrument.

304
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,834
You need to take
better care of it.

305
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,588
And, you know,
stop punishing yourself
while you're at it.

306
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,090
- I'm not.
- You sure?

307
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:13,177
I got slammed because
I didn't know the play.

308
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:16,388
I didn't know the play
because, like an idiot,

309
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,475
instead of memorizing my plays
I was up late last night.

310
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,019
Working on some of my songs
with Valerie.

311
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:24,521
God, I'm such an idiot.

312
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:25,981
Valerie, huh?

313
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,360
No, I endorse this.

314
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:31,653
You jealous, Ronnie?

315
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,447
Please.

316
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,366
I had my seven minutes
in heaven
with Archie Andrews.

317
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,123
Okay. Good as new.

318
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,376
But try to take
better care of it.

319
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:50,047
That hand is going to be
worth millions one day.

320
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,854
These are... fine.

321
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,397
I was up all night.

322
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:08,982
Yeah, I can tell.

323
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,903
Your sheets are
sloppy, rushed.

324
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:14,655
Okay.

325
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,281
I listened to your songs.

326
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:19,034
I think they're, uh, juvenile.

327
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,411
They're repetitive.

328
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,873
- They're break-up songs.
- Yeah, right.

329
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,000
- But Ms. Grundy said that...
- Grundy.

330
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,294
She was your music teacher?
One who left?

331
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,841
This is hard to hear,
and for me to say, but,

332
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,175
I think she must've...

333
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,886
Connected with you
in a way that I just
don't see us doing.

334
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,640
Wait, are you...

335
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:42,933
Is that it?

336
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:44,101
You're saying
I should just quit?

337
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,519
I'm saying that...

338
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:48,981
I don't think I can help you.

339
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,367
Thank you for having me.

340
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:03,912
Cheryl invited you.

341
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,873
I have no idea
why you're here.

342
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,749
Me neither.

343
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,210
I thought there'd
be other girls.

344
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,547
Nana Rose, would you
like some more ham?

345
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,138
Veronica, would you like
some more maple ham?

346
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,682
I'm good.
It's delicious, though.

347
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,851
You can really
taste the maple.

348
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,396
You do know that
Riverdale was founded on
the maple syrup industry.

349
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,274
I didn't, actually.
Fascinating.

350
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,526
That's where Sweetwater River
got its name.

351
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,655
Perhaps you should
ask your father
about it, sometime.

352
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:41,491
How is he, by the way?

353
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:43,660
Okay.

354
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,079
There are worse things
than prison.

355
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,414
Like this dinner party.

356
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:48,540
What did you say?

357
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:54,671
Hmm.

358
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:02,262
It must have been
hard for you.

359
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,350
Watching your father being
handcuffed and dragged
out of your home

360
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,186
in front of you
and your neighbors.

361
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,021
All those reporters.

362
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,527
The worst part is
how fast it happened.

363
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,199
He was just, gone.

364
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,410
I didn't even get
a chance to say goodbye.

365
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,830
That's why I think
it's so great.

366
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,250
You're all getting a chance
to say goodbye
to Jason tomorrow...

367
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,751
Not all of us.

368
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,046
That's because some people
already got to say
goodbye to Jason.

369
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,633
While rowing him
across the river

370
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,552
to his death.

371
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:03,740
Hello?

372
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,941
Daddy! Seriously?

373
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,968
- Polly?
- Dad...

374
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:19,733
<i>Stop filming me!</i>

375
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,153
<i>Say hi to the camera, Polly.</i>

376
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:25,197
<i>I can't practice with you watching!</i>

377
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:27,991
<i>Daddy, I'm shy!</i>

378
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:41,380
I hope this isn't weird, but
Jason was crazy handsome.

379
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,131
The handsomest.

380
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:46,093
Something tells me
he would've liked you.

381
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,223
Why did you invite me tonight?

382
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,893
Why not Tina? Or Ginger?
Aren't they your besties?

383
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,312
And yet,
that night at the pep rally,

384
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,022
after I had my panic attack,

385
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,108
you helped me.

386
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:03,860
Not them.

387
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:07,239
Cheryl.

388
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:12,035
You're allowed to say
goodbye to your brother.

389
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,664
- But, why does it
have to be...
- In front of people?

390
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,165
Yeah.

391
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,586
Everything with Jason's
been so...

392
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,090
Public. Everyone
has an opinion.

393
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,883
Has been gossiping.

394
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,928
Saying he got
what he deserved,
or that he didn't.

395
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:33,098
I just... I want everyone
to know that I'm...

396
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,059
I'm sorry.

397
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,439
And that Jason deserved a...

398
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,818
A better family
than what he got.

399
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,821
Then do it. I'll help you.

400
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:52,242
And let Penelope
and Clifford Blossom
do their worst.

401
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:53,869
Oh, they will.

402
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,122
They'll kill me.

403
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,806
I am here for you, whenever.

404
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:18,351
But why didn't you
call the cops
or animal control services?

405
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,356
It was a message...

406
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,735
...for me
from the Serpents.

407
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,739
I didn't call the police
because I don't trust them.

408
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,158
I don't trust half the people
in this damn town.

409
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:34,951
Just you.

410
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:38,330
Which is why you gotta
tell me why the Serpents...

411
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,664
It's Hiram.

412
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:41,875
He owes them money.

413
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:43,877
How much money?

414
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:47,672
No, Fred. That's between
Hiram and the Serpents.

415
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,884
Thank you so much
for coming here tonight.

416
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,471
But I don't want to get you
any more involved
than you already are.

417
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,068
You ready to enter
the belly of the beast?

418
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:14,574
It was the best I could do.

419
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,419
Hi.

420
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:33,093
Penelope, I just want to
offer my condolences.

421
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:35,595
Hermione, that's so kind.

422
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:36,721
Hmm.

423
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:41,268
You think you're
so clever coming here
and offering your pity?

424
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:44,688
- What are you talking about?
- So you've come to gloat?

425
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:48,233
With warmest regards
from your husband I'm sure.

426
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:57,117
You ready?

427
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,119
Just about.

428
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,496
You go ahead.
I'll be down.

429
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,123
Okay.

430
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,810
I'm so sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Blossom.

431
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,480
I thought you might
want to have this.

432
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,111
You're so much like him.

433
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:43,580
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you, Archibald.

434
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,342
Did she just touch your hair?

435
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,261
That was really sweet
what you did.

436
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,764
She deserves it.
More than I do.

437
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:07,437
Days like today really put
things in perspective, huh?

438
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,608
I mean, at least we're here.

439
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:13,860
At least we're alive.

440
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,370
Got to pace yourself, Hal.

441
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:26,414
Be very unseemly to get
a DUI on your way home.

442
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:27,540
Wouldn't you think?

443
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:04,077
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

444
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,840
Welcome to Thornhill.

445
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,008
Thank you all for coming.

446
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,136
If you'll kindly
take your seats.

447
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,266
I'd like to start the memorial

448
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,686
with a few words about Jason.

449
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:34,858
You are only going
to make things worse.

450
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,999
The last time I saw Jason,

451
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,376
I was wearing this dress.

452
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,173
I know it's impossible.

453
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,424
But I swear,

454
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:01,593
when I put it on, it...

455
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,053
It feels like
he's in the room with me.

456
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:14,773
Even though we were twins,
I used to demand
I have my own birthday party.

457
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,193
Until one year,
out of the blue,

458
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,945
Jason convinced me we had to
combine them into one.

459
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,573
It wasn't until years later,
I found out why.

460
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:26,785
It was because no one
wanted to come to mine.

461
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:29,454
And Jason
didn't want me to know.

462
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:31,289
He protected me.

463
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,542
Every single day.

464
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:39,130
I wish, that day at the river,
I had protected him.

465
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:47,806
I'm so sorry, Jay-Jay.

466
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,559
We failed you. All of us.

467
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:10,620
I think we'll adjourn now
to the Winter Salon

468
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:12,247
for a light supper.

469
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,299
Hey.

470
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:27,095
- Hey.
- I didn't think you were
going to make it.

471
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,639
Yeah, I got off a little
late from work, but, um...

472
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,391
I did wanna pay my respects.

473
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,308
Yeah.

474
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:36,187
Also, I realized
something last night.

475
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,024
The bookkeeping position
at my company
that you applied for?

476
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,401
It's still open.

477
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:44,404
No snakes.
If you're interested.

478
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:45,947
Yes, yes, yes.

479
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,620
Um, thank you.

480
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,205
Yeah.

481
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:19,272
Is it me or did
the temperature just drop
like it does in horror movies?

482
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:22,108
That's just the icy chill
of the dead.

483
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:28,031
Where does a teenage boy
hide things?

484
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:32,076
Under the mattresses,
maybe in the drawers,

485
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:34,662
behind the headboard,
in the closet.

486
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:46,507
- Hello.
- Holy...

487
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:52,555
I'm so sorry,
we were just leaving.

488
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:55,850
Oh. It's you.

489
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:59,062
How lovely to see you again.

490
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,774
Come closer, I wanna get
a good look at you.

491
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:05,693
The horror. The horror.

492
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,157
Come closer, Polly dear.

493
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,832
It's nice to
see you again, too.

494
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:24,671
I'm sorry it had to be under
such terrible circumstances.

495
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:27,131
Well, of course
you're not wearing it.

496
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,051
- God bless.
- Wearing what?

497
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,220
The ring, Polly.

498
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:36,975
That ring has been
in the Blossom family
for generations.

499
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:41,312
You keep it close
to your heart, always.

500
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:45,900
But don't tell Penelope
I gave it to you.

501
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:50,905
Or she'll likely come and
snip it off your finger!

502
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:53,950
I won't, I promise.

503
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,786
Such a shame.

504
00:33:57,328 --> 00:34:01,165
Your wedding
was the last thing
I was living for.

505
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,293
I lost a grandson,

506
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:06,087
but you,

507
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:10,508
you've lost the love
of your young life.

508
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:13,011
Poor child.

509
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,345
Excuse me.

510
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:16,806
I have to...

511
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:18,891
I can't...

512
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:27,942
I had to. It's what Jason
would've wanted.

513
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:31,279
No, Cheryl. As always,
it's what you wanted.

514
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,784
I hope you enjoyed yourself.

515
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:41,080
'Cause after tonight,

516
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,959
there will be
no more River Vixens.

517
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:50,173
And if not for the fact
that no one would have you,

518
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:54,135
I'd be shipping you off
to a boarding school
in Europe tonight.

519
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,524
What if
Ms. Grundy was lying?

520
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:11,277
People lie all the time.
Maybe she didn't want to
hurt my feelings.

521
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:13,029
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

522
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,447
Castillo doesn't think
I have the chops.

523
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,324
So, Ms. Grundy said
you were good,

524
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,076
and you thought
you were good?

525
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:19,994
Castillo says you are bad,
and now you think you're bad?

526
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:22,371
I just...
I want to get this right.

527
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,623
You wouldn't understand.

528
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,875
Who wouldn't? You want me
to wallow with you?

529
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:27,418
I don't have time.

530
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:29,921
You have a band
backing you up, Val.
It's not that easy...

531
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,215
No, Archie, it's hard.

532
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:34,050
It's almost impossible.

533
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:35,885
But let me ask you this
right now.

534
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:38,096
Who's telling you
you can't do your music?

535
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:39,639
Your coach?

536
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,682
Mr. Castillo? Your dad?

537
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:43,851
Or is it just you?

538
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:52,902
You dragged me out
of the Blossom house,
and then

539
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:55,238
you don't talk to me
the whole way home.

540
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:57,532
Dad, Jason and Polly
were engaged.

541
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:00,159
Did you know that?

542
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,371
Oh, my God.

543
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,375
Of course you did.

544
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:10,837
Is that what you
and Clifford Blossom
were talking about?

545
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:13,256
That is none of your business.

546
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:15,883
Yes, it is my business.

547
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:19,053
So stop avoiding it
and just tell me
what's going on.

548
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:23,182
Clifford and I were arguing

549
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:26,102
because he
and his filthy clan

550
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,105
came this close to
destroying our family.

551
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:33,234
Your little friend Cheryl's
great-grandfather...

552
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,489
...murdered yours, Betty.

553
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,199
Why?

554
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:42,118
The same reason
they do everything.

555
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,703
Greed and hate.

556
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:51,210
They were in
business together.

557
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:53,838
Selling and trading
maple syrup.

558
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:56,299
And one day
great-grandfather Blossom

559
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,759
decided that he didn't
want to share the profits.

560
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:04,140
So he murdered my grandfather
in cold blood.

561
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:06,392
That's why you hated Jason?

562
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:11,147
Because of some blood feud
that happened before
you were even born?

563
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,733
They stole our
livelihood, Betty.

564
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,986
And I'd die before I let them
steal my daughter, too.

565
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:19,363
- Where is she?
- She is sick!

566
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:22,950
And Jason made her sick.

567
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:29,498
And she's not coming home
until she isn't sick anymore.

568
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:32,460
Fair warning. Stay out of it.

569
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,391
There's not a lot of love lost
between your dad and Clifford.

570
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,435
Or me and Penelope,
for that matter.

571
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:52,647
Still, that family...

572
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:55,191
to lose a child that young...

573
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,651
That way...

574
00:37:56,943 --> 00:38:01,906
I just spent the last 24 hours
in the gothic horror story
that is Cheryl Blossom's life.

575
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,993
And it just reminded me
how lucky I am.

576
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,248
To have a mom who protects me.

577
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:19,590
Then I need to tell you about
something that happened
last night at Pop's.

578
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:30,893
I saw a lot of fire and hustle
from both of you this week.

579
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:33,354
It was almost
too close to call.

580
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:43,614
Reggie, your time will come.

581
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,617
But for this season, at least,

582
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:51,372
this is a new number,
seeing that you took it upon
yourself to retire Jason's.

583
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:54,875
Which was the right call.

584
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:58,754
You know exactly
what a captain should
and would do.

585
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:05,386
Dude, are you insane?
Take the jersey.

586
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:08,264
I... can't.

587
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:10,349
I can't, Coach.

588
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,479
I love playing football,

589
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:19,483
but your starting line-up
deserves a captain whose
only love is football.

590
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:21,694
Someone like Reggie.

591
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:22,820
What?

592
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,033
I mean, yeah.

593
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:29,952
What? You're quitting
on me, Andrews?

594
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:33,122
No, and I really hope
you don't cut me, Coach.

595
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:34,707
Cause I friggin'
love being a Bulldog.

596
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:39,337
But that part of me that
I would have to give to you
if I were captain,

597
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:42,840
I gotta save that
for something else.

598
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:06,113
<i>Every town has one.</i>

599
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:09,617
<i>The house on the haunted hill
all the kids avoid.</i>

600
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,952
<i>Now that Jason was
buried in the earth,</i>

601
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:13,788
<i>it would only be
a matter of time</i>

602
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,457
<i>until something
poisonous bloomed.</i>

603
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:20,378
<i>In that long, cold shadow
cast by his death.</i>

604
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:28,761
<i>Whatever grew in the rich
black soil of
the Blossom's garden</i>

605
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:30,888
<i>always found its way
to the town.</i>

606
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:34,892
<i>Whether it was murder.
Or love. Or secrets.</i>

607
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:37,144
<i>Or lies.</i>

608
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:38,854
Juggie, I feel like
I don't even know

609
00:40:39,063 --> 00:40:40,773
who my mom and dad
are anymore.

610
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:42,858
Betty...

611
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:49,240
if your parents
lied about Jason and Polly,

612
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,034
there's probably more
that they lied about.

613
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:55,871
What do you mean?

614
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,125
Your dad said he would do
anything to protect Polly.

615
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,168
So the next logical
question is...

616
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:03,212
How far would he go
to protect her?

617
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:10,136
Jughead,

618
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:13,472
whoever broke into
Sheriff Keller's house

619
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:16,142
and stole all his evidence
wasn't at the drive-in.

620
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:29,280
My Dad wasn't at the drive-in.

621
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:49,175
We need to talk to Polly.
