Did you know that?

356
00:14:18,286 --> 00:14:20,133
She's taught a lot of people, Betty.
What's your point?

357
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:21,301
My point is,

358
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:23,202
you don't know anything
about her, Archie.

359
00:14:23,204 --> 00:14:25,371
- Doesn't that worry you?
- Betty, let this go.

360
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:27,540
- Archie, please...
- If you're really my friend,

361
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:28,808
you'll let this go.

362
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:31,377
Okay.

363
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,673
I'm sorry. I'm done.

364
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:37,183
I'll stop digging.

365
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,019
ARCHIE: I know it's not the drive-in,

366
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:41,788
but given our circumstances...

367
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,523
It's perfect.

368
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:46,930

talk about you and your life.

371

- I dunno.

372
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:00,206

373
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:02,942
Anything. Have you always
wanted to be a teacher?

374
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,510
No. [LAUGHS]

375
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:05,712
No, I, um...

376
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:08,800
I graduated Juilliard,

377
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:10,750
and I auditioned at Carnegie Hall,

378
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:13,319
Lincoln Center, all the big symphonies,

379
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:14,420
but I didn't

380
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:16,925
make the cut. Not even close.

381
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:19,258
I had a dream.

382
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:25,075
Sometimes that's all they are.

383
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,367
Just dreams.

384
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:30,169
And what about us?

385
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,139
Is this a dream?

386
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:34,941
Would that be so bad?

387
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,343
If it is...

388
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:41,047
It's a nice dream.

389
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,474
Where does this end, Geraldine?

390
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,154
I have no idea.

391
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:50,494
But we're here.

392
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:53,092
And for me...

393
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,662
That's enough.

394
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:06,472
So much for letting this go.

395
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:13,479
Are we really breaking
into Grundy's car right now?

396
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:16,382
How do you even know how to do that?

397
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:18,818

399
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,734
Okay, before going any further,

400
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:35,902
if I'm committing a felony,

401
00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:37,904
I need to at least ask the question.

402
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:40,706
Are you doing this because you
still have feelings for Archie, or...

403
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,308
No, Veronica.

404
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,943
We're doing this
because Grundy has Archie

405
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:46,412
under some kind of sexual spell,

406
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:47,862
and he won't listen to reason.

407
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:51,236
We're looking for anything that proves
Grundy isn't as clean as she says she is.

408
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,925

409
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:01,103
Okay, Ms. Gyver.

410
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:11,771

still on this crazy witch hunt.

It's not a witch hunt,
and it's not crazy.

00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:00,378
- You were in her car?
- VERONICA: Yeah,

422
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,613
and thank God we were.

423
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,381
- We found a gun.
- What?

424
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,284
And an ID with the name Jennifer Gibson.

425
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,454
This is proof Ms. Grundy
is not who she says she is.

426
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:10,585
Then who is she?

427
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:13,191
Obviously some sketch-queen
named Jennifer Gibson.

428
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,060
Archie, what if she had something to do

429
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:16,361
with Jason's murder?

430
00:18:16,364 --> 00:18:18,897
She taught him, she
made you lie about him,

431
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,932
we know she was at the
river, she has a gun.

432
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,501
So does Dilton Doiley, but you
never thought he killed Jason.

433
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:24,569
Open your eyes, Archie.

434
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,571
Jason was her student last year.

435
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,474
Everything about her is a
huge, boldfaced question mark.

436
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,443
Okay, whatever her name
is, she's not a killer.

437
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,210
You didn't ask her, did you?

438
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,512
About her name?

439
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,440
And why there's no record
of her before last year?

bought the land, and convince them

not to demolish a holy house of cinema.

from one of our job sites.

457

Right.
