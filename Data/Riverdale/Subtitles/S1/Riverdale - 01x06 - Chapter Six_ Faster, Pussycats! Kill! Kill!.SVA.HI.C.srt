- If you're interested...
- Yes, yes, yes.

7
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:16,227
Oh, Hiram.

What did Jason do that was so bad?

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,905
Jason and Polly had a fight.

13
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:30,241
Afterwards, Polly was pretty devastated,

14
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:32,043
so we sent her to a hospital.

15
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:34,946
If your parents lied
about Jason and Polly,

16
00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:36,764
there's probably more
that they lied about.

17
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:39,717
Dad, Jason and Polly were
engaged. Did you know that?

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,565
I'd die before I let
them steal my daughter.

19

So, Jughead...

36
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:53,958
I suppose we have you to thank
for Betty's ongoing obsession

37
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,927
with this Jason Blossom ghoulishness?

38
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:58,863
Actually, Mom, I was
the one who asked Jughead

39
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:01,299
to help me write it for
the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,380
- Sure, I'll show you.
- No, no. I'll show him.

When I was up there, looking
out... I don't know, I just I froze.

66
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:52,677
That was stage fright, Archie.

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,731
Yeah, but when I'm on the football
field, the stands can be packed.

68
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,695
Packed, and it doesn't
affect my game at all.

69
00:03:57,698 --> 00:04:01,185
Singing makes you vulnerable
in a way that football doesn't.

70
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:05,056
Or maybe what I was missing
out there onstage was my team.

71
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:07,358
Or at least a partner.

72
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:09,927
What if we sang<i> I Got You?</i>

73
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:12,096
Archie, I'm a Pussycat.

74

We're headlining the Variety Show.

75

89
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:11,895
What we're attempting is a
stealth operation, Archie.

90

the entire Scooby Gang,

91

- VERONICA: Excuse me.
- VALERIE: What do you mean?

96
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,810
Oh, nothing. Just that I had a
few words with our director/host,

97
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:35,679
and reminded him that he's heard
you sing on numerous occasions.

98

my artistic integrity.

have a slot if you want it.

you saw what happened.
