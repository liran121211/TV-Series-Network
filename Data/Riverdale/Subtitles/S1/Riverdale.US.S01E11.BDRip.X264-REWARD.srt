Polly's our woman

<i>Blossoms had something

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,175
And I'm gonna prove it.

5
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:11,096
My dad hired Jughead's dad
to trash the drive-in.

6
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:13,598
Dad, did you have
anything to do with
Jason Blossom's death?

7
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:14,724
I'm no killer.

8
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,601
- Do you believe him?
- I do.

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,561
Hiram Lodge's
daughter is here.

10
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,939
She said something
about her father being
connected to Jason's murder.

11
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:23,274
These kids are more
on the ball than the Sheriff.

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,111
<i>I'm messed up, Veronica...</i>

13
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:27,612

00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:31,074

29
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:07,444
so I can keep focusing on
the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

30
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:08,486
Unacceptable.

31
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:11,614
You made a commitment,
Ms. Cooper,
you need to honor it.

32
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,576
Especially since
this Homecoming is
also a Reunion Weekend.

33

<i>Or to make up for lost time.</i>

38
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:28,757
Archie, the reason
why I came...

39
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,175
You came
because of the divorce.

40
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:32,927
Because I called Dad.

41
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:36,931
You know, I thought that
Riverdale would be better
for you than Chicago.

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,808
- It would be safer...
- It's okay, Mom.

43
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:41,561
Really, I'm okay.

44
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:45,148
And I mean,
it hasn't been all bad.

45
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:46,858
My friends are amazing.

46
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,611
Dad and I are closer than
ever right now. And also...

47
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:50,862
You've been singing.

48
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:52,864
Songwriting, yeah.
And singing.

49
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:55,450
- And your dad tells me
that you're great.

50
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,577
I hope you'll play me
some songs before I go.

51
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:58,703
Yeah, for sure.

52
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,373
I'm playing at the dance.
So, if you want
to see me play live...

53
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:09,130
That's incredible, Paul.

54
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,174
You will keep us posted,
won't you?

55
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:13,968
Okay, thanks... Thank you.

56
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:16,554
Some good news for a change?

57
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:18,723
That was your dad's attorney.

58
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,642
Turns out, our statements
did make a difference

59
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,894
and the judge seems
inclined to give
your father a break.

60
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:24,104
How much of a break?

61
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,231
Time served.
A few more months,
if that.

62
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,732
And then what?

63
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:29,067
We move back to New York?

64
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,568
Or your father moves here.

65
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:32,737
What about the crimes
he's committed?

66
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:35,031
Including, maybe,
Jason Blossom.

67
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,117
Stop it, Veronica.

68
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,452
There is no proof
that your father had
anything to do with that.

69
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:41,496
He's in jail because of
the Blossoms, Mom,

70
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,206
that gives him a motive.

71
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:46,960
Okay. Veronica, you need to be
supporting your father,

72
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,795
not demonizing him...

73
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,965
Again, for things that
you have no proof of.

74
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:13,403
Dad,

75
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,071
have you been body-snatched?

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,739
Oh, I feel good, Jug.

77
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,616
Wanna look good, too.

78
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:20,910
Shave.
Clean the place up a bit.

79
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,245
A little paint...

80
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,913
Oh, I got us some
coffee and donuts.

81
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,957
And I read your, uh...
Your essay?

82
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,333
Manuscript?

83
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,127
- You did?
- Yeah.

84
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:31,379
- Really?
- I asked you for it, didn't I?

85
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:33,423
Yeah, I don't know.
I figured you were just
pretending to be interested.

86
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,175
This is excellent.

87
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:38,344
Me, I can barely
string two sentences together,

88
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,096
but you... You got a gift.

89
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,432
Thank God you're
not wasting it.

90
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,766
Mind if I ask you
a couple questions?

91
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,768
Yeah. Of course.

92
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:48,146
Why Jason Blossom, huh?

93
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,190
Out of all the things
you could write about,

94
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:51,649
why pick a dead kid?

95
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:53,651
I don't know. It was
sort like he picked me.

96
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,488
Tell the story that no one
was gonna tell.

97
00:03:57,697 --> 00:03:58,740
Or even know how to tell.

98
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,533
From the outside, looking in.

99
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:01,826
Who do you think killed him?

100
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:05,288
I mean, you and Betty
are in this deep.
You gotta have an opinion.

101
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:09,667
To me, I don't think
the question is,

102
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:10,793
"Whodunnit?"

103
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,754
I think the real question is

104
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:15,131
whether Riverdale
is a place of good

105
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,300
or a place of
darkness and evil.

106
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,259
Or both.

107
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:19,469
Most things are both.

108
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:22,305
Can I make one suggestion?

109
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,974
That's what Betty says,
and then it's about
a dozen suggestions.

110
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:27,810
I think, at a certain point,
you should

111
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,230
move on.

112
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,441
You can't let this be
the only story you're
gonna tell, Jughead.

113
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,401
Hell, it shouldn't even be
the most important one.

114
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:41,032
Ronnie, wait up.

115
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:43,243
Hey, I just wanted
to explain why I didn't
call you after the party.

116
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,702
My mom showed up
out of nowhere.

117
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,371
It's fine, you don't
owe me an explanation.

118
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,664
Wait, Veronica,

119
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:50,917
are we seriously not
gonna talk about what
happened between us?

120
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,335
Archie.

121
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:58,800
We had a moment.
A beautiful,
but fleeting moment.

122
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,386
- We spent the night.
- We crashed,
in separate beds.

123
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,763
I don't regret anything
we said, Veronica, or did.

124
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:05,056
Me neither,

125
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:07,058
but I think you might be
boyfriend-worthy.

126
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:09,560
I agree. Let's test
that theory at the
Homecoming Dance.

127
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,312
Unfortunately, I don't
have the bandwidth

128
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:13,564
to explore anything
with anyone right now.

129
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,400
Well, in that case,

130
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:17,986
what if we just finally get to
sing that duet together?

131
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:20,154
I kind of told my mom
I was performing.

132
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:26,411
Look, Archie, I'm sorry,
but for a million reasons,

133
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:28,538
we're going to have to
pretend our moment
never happened.

134
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:31,708
I'll see you later.

135
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,049
Oh, finally, close that door.

136
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:45,096
Ladies, I need you
to look around the room.

137
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:47,765
Whoever is not in this room
is on the table

138
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:49,684
as a possible murder suspect.

139
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,060
Including those Pussycats.

140
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:52,437
Oh, my God, Mom...

141
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:56,357
Now, let's talk
about your father.

142
00:05:56,941 --> 00:06:00,778
He has an epic grudge
against the Blossoms,
so yes.

143
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:02,363
It's totally within the
realm of possibility

144
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:06,242
that he hired someone
from jail to kill Jason.

145
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:07,910
Maybe Jughead's dad.

146
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,787
You really believe that?

147
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:13,291
My dad paid Jughead's
dad to trash the drive-in.

148
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,877
- Maybe he paid him to...
- Commit murder.

149
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:19,756
And, for all we know,
that gay Greaser Serpent
is an accomplice.

150
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:21,215
And what are you
basing that off of?

151
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,926
That you saw FP
and Joaquin talking?

152
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,261
It didn't look like
they were talking.

153
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,512
It looked like
they were conspiring.

154
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,139
Conspiring about what?

155
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:29,974
That's what
I need you to find out.

156
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,477
Either through Jughead
or FP directly,

157
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,937
without raising suspicion,
of course.

158
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:38,983
Which is why I have
prepared a seemingly
innocuous list of questions.

159
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:41,194
I already asked Jughead,
point-blank,

160
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,488
if he thought his father
had anything to do
with Jason's death,

161
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:44,739
and he said no.

162
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,617
And I believed him,
and I still believe him.

163
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,452
Betty, you're
too close to this.

164
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,829
I'm not going
to insult Jughead

165
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:54,082
or betray him
by entertaining this.

166
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:58,127
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a Homecoming Dance
to plan.

167
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:00,713
Come on, Vee, let's go.

168
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,135
Mrs. Cooper?

169
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:48,261
Yes?

170
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,227
I understand why Betty
doesn't want to get
in the middle of this.

171
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:59,605
But I don't feel the same
loyalty for the Jones
family that she does.

172
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,900
- I'm listening.
- Helping you
find out the truth

173
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:05,736
about FP will help me find
out the truth about my dad.

174
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:08,322
And whether or not
he hired FP to kill Jason.

175
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,409
What exactly
are you saying, Veronica?

176
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:12,869
I'm saying,

177
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:17,623
if you want to go after
Jughead's dad,
Mrs. Cooper, I'm in.

178
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:20,960
<i>Sorry to interrupt,</i>

179
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,795
but I have an
announcement to make.

180
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,382
One that tangentially
involves you, Betty.

181
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,802
I'm bringing Polly
to the dance as my date,

182
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:32,138
and we're campaigning as
co-queens of Homecoming Court.

183
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,391
- Because why?
- Because, Nightmare Smurfette,

184
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,644
by all rights, it should've
been Polly and Jason
on that stage being crowned.

185
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,271
This is the next best thing.

186
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,149
So... Don't forget to vote,

187
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,067
and I'll see
everyone at my coronation!

188
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:48,237
Betty, about the
Homecoming Dance,

189
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:50,865
can I play a couple songs?
I kind of told my mom that...

190
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:52,617
Whoa, you don't want me to?

191
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:55,912
No, no it's not that, Archie,
it's just, um...

192
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,873
This dance needs to be fun.

193
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,167
And your songs,
as amazing as they are...

194
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,919
They make you wanna
slit your wrists.

195
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:07,798
- In a good way.
- In an amazing way.

196
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,675
But no need to fret, Betty.

197
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,344
'Cause Archie asked me
to sing with him,

198
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,554
and we're thinking about doing
some upbeat covers.

199
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:16,307
We are?

200
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,142
Aren't we?

201
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:24,524
Not that I'm complaining,
Ronnie,

202
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,067
but why the change of heart?

203
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,654
Because I'm hoping
you'll say yes to the
favor I'm about to ask you.

204
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,822
Hey, if it's gonna help you,
then I'm in.

205
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:34,659
Remember when

206
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,912
you heard Clifford Blossom
say he put my dad in jail?

207
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:43,000
Well, I think my dad may have
gone after Jason as payback.

208
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,418
He's very eye-for-an-eye,

209
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,797
and I have a strong suspicion
he hired Jughead's dad
to do his dirty work.

210
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:51,551
Also, FP's done my dad's
bidding before.
He trashed the drive-in.

211
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,679
It's a big leap to go from
vandalism to murder, Ronnie.

212
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,389
I talked it over
with Mrs. Cooper.

213
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,474
- And...
- She's a part of this?
Are you nuts?

214
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:00,810
She's gonna keep FP busy
while we search his trailer

215
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,688
to find anything
that links FP to Jason.

216
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,106
Or, more importantly,
FP to my dad.

217
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,024
We should
just talk to Jughead.

218
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,402
No, what if he's protecting FP

219
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,778
or tries to warn him?

220
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:12,238
He's our friend, Ronnie.

221
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,574
My dad is this close
to being released,

222
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:18,369
and my mom's in denial
and she's ready to welcome
him back with open arms.

223
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:21,789
Me, I'd like to know
exactly who

224
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:23,666
we're inviting back
into our lives.

225
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,710
Look, Veronica, I really
wanna help you,

226
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,753
I do, and I definitely don't
want Jughead to get hurt,

227
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,339
but I'm telling you,
FP's cleaned up his act.

228
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:31,841
I hope you're right
about that, Archie,

229
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,926
because if not,

230
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:39,515
Jughead could get
dragged into something
very messy and very dangerous.

231
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:53,946
- Hermione, hi.
- Mary Andrews?

232
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:56,741
What... What are you
doing in town?

233
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,451
Oh just a
spur-of-the-moment visit.

234
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,454
I was hoping to surprise
Fred with lunch.

235
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:02,830
Oh, he's off-site.

236
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,166
He's picking up some
supplies from a vendor.

237
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,293
Yeah, he told me that
you were working for him.

238
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,502
With him.

239
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,340
Yeah, he says
he admires your chutzpah.

240
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,175
That's a very
Fred thing to say, huh?

241
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,926
Yeah, but in this case,
I agree.

242
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,262
You know,
I've been following the news.

243
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:21,015
Yeah.

244
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:25,102
Karmic payback
for being such a mean girl
in high school, I suppose.

245
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,079
Polly, thank God,
what's going on?

246
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:46,248
<i>And why are you running
to be Homecoming
co-queen with Cheryl?</i>

247
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:47,541
To keep her distracted.

248
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,834
Did you find something?

249
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,628
Not yet, but they're
definitely hiding things.

250
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,046
<i>Remember our deal, Polly,</i>

251
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,714
if you don't find anything
by Homecoming, it's over

252
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:55,091
you're coming home.

253
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,592
I just have to get
into their bedroom.

254
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,469
They protect it obsessively.

255
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:00,888
Well, you're not putting
yourself in any danger,
are you?

256
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,350
Betty, I gotta go, I'm sorry.

257
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,604
Your daily milkshake.

258
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,400
- You must be famished.
- Mmm-hmm.

259
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:15,027
What, with all the
exploring you've been doing.

260
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,074
The East Wing,
where Mr. Blossom and I

261
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,910
have our sleeping quarters,
is out of bounds.

262
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:26,330
Mr. Blossom values
his privacy. You understand.

263
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,499
I'm so sorry.
It won't happen again.

264
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,127
Good.

265
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:38,926
Thanks.

266
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:40,636
Hey, you.

267
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,014
- Why didn't you tell me
about the dinner?
- What?

268
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,766
Your mom basically
tackled me in the hall

269
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:47,685
to invite my dad and I
over before the dance.

270
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,190
- Did you not know?
- No, no, of course, I've just,
you know, got so many...

271
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,609
Plates are spinning...

272
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,237
I'm a little terrified
about the social
experiment of it all,

273
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:00,531
but I think it's good

274
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,949
for our families to
get to know each other.

275
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:05,870
I think it's important
for us. You know?

276
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:07,997
Yeah.

277
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,542
I know what you're doing, Mom.

278
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:12,960
Whatever do you mean?
I'm making peach pie

279
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:14,503
for our guests.

280
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,213
No, you're laying out
some kind of trap

281
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:17,673
for Jughead's dad.

282
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:19,383
On the contrary, Betty,

283
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:21,635
I took what you said
earlier to heart.

284
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,221
So you're not going to
question Jughead or his dad
about the murder then?

285
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,058
I mean, only if it happens
to come up as casual
dinner conversation.

286
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,936
I'm not playing this game
with you, Mom.

287
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:32,480
And neither is Jughead,

288
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,690
not after I tell him
what you're planning here.

289
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,901
Are you sure
that's a good idea, Betty?

290
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:41,405
When I invited Jughead,
he seemed so excited.

291
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:43,073
Like it really
meant a lot to him

292
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,825
that our families are gonna
get to know each other.

293
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,121
That's all I'm after, honey.

294
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,041
FP is innocent, Mom.

295
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,212
Jughead said so,
and I trust him.

296
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,591
I'm sure the question of FP's
guilt or innocence
won't even come up at dinner.

297
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,018
Now, this is
pretty good.

298
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:13,312
Oh, there he is.

299
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:17,107
Son, your mom and I
are trying to decide between
pizza and Chinese food.

300
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,819
- What do you think?
- Uh... We always do pizza.

301
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,947
Let me guess.
Pepperoni and red pepper?

302
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,824
All right, so, Moon Palace,
they still deliver.

303
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,117
- We can get, um...
- General Tso's chicken,

304
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:30,454
scallion pancakes,
vegetable dumplings,
family-style.

305
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,040
What's wrong, son?

306
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,042
Huh? Nothing.

307
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,797
I'm just... I'm not used
to coming home and
seeing you guys together.

308
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:40,923
It's nice, but...

309
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,804
- Hello?
- Jughead, hey.

310
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,391
Am I interrupting
a family meeting?
'Cause I can come back.

311
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,517
Absolutely not.

312
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,269
So, who's going to the dance?

313
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:56,313
Besides your dad and me...
Oh, and Hermione,
whom I invited.

314
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,148
- You did?
- We'll talk about it.

315
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,901
Wait, you guys are going
to the dance? Together?

316
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,154
We were talking about it.

317
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,699
We both want to hear you play,
if that's still happening.

318
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,284
If you're good with it.

319
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:12,621
Yeah, totally.
I'm great with it.

320
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,748
- Good.
<i>- So the worm turns.</i>

321
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,166
Mary and Fred.

322
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,377
A possible rekindling?

323
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,504
That would've been
a Li'l Archie's pipe dream.

324
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:22,131
Stranger things have
happened, man.

325
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,760
Like for instance,
my dad shaved.

326
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,847
Which is the equivalent
of tectonic plates shifting.

327
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:34,852
I was thinking,
maybe it's time I go back
and live with him again.

328
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:37,271
Based on the fact
that he shaved?

329
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,857
Well, he also hasn't missed
a day of work,

330
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,650
and he quit drinking.

331
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:43,569
That's...
That's great, Jughead.

332
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,238
But maybe you should wait
a little bit longer just to
make sure it sticks.

333
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,782
No, dude, I'm telling you,
something has shifted.

334
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,243
I mean, he even asked
to read my work.

335
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,038
The essays, the articles
I wrote about Jason.

336
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:55,372
- Your dad did?
- Yeah.

337
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,874
And he read them.

338
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:59,126
Even more surprisingly,
he engaged with them.

339
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:00,669
He asked me
questions about them.

340
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,380
- What kind of questions?
- Like who I thought did it.

341
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:05,549
Your dad asked you
who you thought
killed Jason Blossom?

342
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:09,470
You repeating everything
I'm saying is getting
really annoying.

343
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:13,724
Crap, I forgot. My mom likes
almond milk in her coffee,

344
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:15,309
and we don't have any, so...

345
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,727
I'm gonna go get some.

346
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,105
Well, you are
a terrible liar, Archie.

347
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:24,360
Off to a late-night
rendezvous with a certain
raven-haired princess?

348
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:28,364
Relax, man, I'm just giving
you a hard time.

349
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:37,331
Archie.

350
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,212
If this is a booty call...

351
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,130
Look, I've been thinking about
what you asked me.

352
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:46,799
I wanna help you.

353
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,968
What prompted
this return to sanity?

354
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,177
Jughead.

355
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:54,348
He's been hurt and
let down by his dad
so many times.

356
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,100
And what if FP
did help your dad?

357
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,102
That's what I'm saying,
what if?

358
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,561
But, Veronica...

359
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,064
Jughead can never find out.

360
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:03,983
And neither can Betty.

361
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,332
Oh, Pollikins,

362
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,460
it's much more fun
being friends
than mortal enemies.

363
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,838
And I'm glad we're honoring
Jay-Jay's legacy together.

364
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,923
This color
totally pops on you.

365
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:29,675
Okay, so I was thinking.

366
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,177
The theme for the dance is
"Blast from the Past," right?

367
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,179
So, I say, we go
retro and borrow

368
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,473
some of your mom's
vintage bling for the night.

369
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,518
Ooh, you're naughty, Polly.

370
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,650
My mom and dad
would fah-reak if
they knew we were in here.

371
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:49,570
So let's take our sweet time.

372
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,448
How many wigs
does your father have?

373
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:53,949
One for every mood.

374
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:59,079
Legend has it
that Clifford's hair
turned white overnight.

375
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,248
Supposedly, he saw the
ghost of Grandpappy Blossom

376
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:02,958
with his throat slit.

377
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,294
Now, me, I love a silver fox,

378
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,130
but we Blossoms live
and die by our red curls.

379
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,674
My father tried
dying it once, but...

380
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:14,511
But what?

381
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:21,018
What is that?
What did you find?

382
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,022
My nana's ring...

383
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:27,024
Which she gave to Jason.

384
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:30,152
He... He proposed to me
with that ring.

385
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,780
So how does
your mother have it?

386
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:35,282
I...

387
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,535
Hands off, Gollum.

388
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,579
The only way your mom
could have that ring

389
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,748
is if she or your dad
got it from Jason,

390
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:43,916
and he wouldn't
have given it up.

391
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,250
Not over his dead body.

392
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:47,669
Polly...

393
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,880
You are carrying
precious cargo,

394
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,133
but if you think
for one second

395
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,469
that those babies guarantee
your safety,

396
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,472
you're in for a
rude awakening.

397
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,944
Super-delicious, Mrs. C.

398
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,445
Sure is, Alice.

399
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,615
Been a long time
since I ate something
that didn't come in a

400
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,534
combo meal or a snack pack.

401
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,871
- So, FP...
- Mmm.

402
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,332
Betty tells me that you're
working for Fred Andrews now.

403
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,836
How do you balance
that with all of your
other responsibilities?

404
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,671
You mean like
being a father?

405
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,382
- And being a part of the
Southside community.
- Mom.

406
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,635
You can say
"Southside Serpent," Alice.
I'm not ashamed.

407
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:39,763
And it's not just me,
there's a bunch of us
working on Fred's site.

408
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:42,724
So, if you don't mind
me asking, I mean,
I'm just curious,

409
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,352
how did you make
your living before that?

410
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,855
I scraped by. Odd jobs.

411
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:53,402
I know that you
worked for the drive-in,
Jughead, before it was closed.

412
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,529
Did you find
work there, too, FP?

413
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,032
- Dad.
- Well, hung out a bit.

414
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,868
What can I say?
I'm a movie buff.

415
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,413
So, tell me,

416
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,708
were you upset
when Hiram Lodge
bought the drive-in land?

417
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,088
Stuff happens.

418
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,465
Let me rephrase that question.
Were you surprised?

419
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,221
I'll get it.

420
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,437
- Hi.
- Hey.

421
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,480
Right this way.

422
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,070
I thought you said she
wanted me to be here.

423
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,280
She does.

424
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,740
I mean, it is Homecoming
after all.

425
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,327
And our families should be
coming together.

426
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:45,204
Right, Mom?

427
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,963
It's the same as when
we were kids.

428
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,683
You start in the bedroom,
I'll start in here.

429
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,818
You wanted an explanation.

430
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,197
The last time
Clifford saw Jason

431
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,910
was the day my son washed
his hands of our family.

432
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,665
Jason wanted nothing more to
do with the Blossom name,

433
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,209
nor our lineage.

434
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:38,048
Including the ring,
which he threw in Clifford's
face as his final rebuke.

435
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:41,009
Clifford then gave the ring
to me for safekeeping.

436
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:44,346
I...

437
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,682
I thought the ring
had been lost...

438
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:50,936
Nothing's lost forever.

439
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,940
Everything comes back.

440
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,989
Now. Unless you have
any more questions,

441
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:05,075
I'll leave you to finish
getting ready for the dance.

442
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,832
And drink up, dear.
Before it melts.

443
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:29,683
I'm hoping maybe you have some
vacancies down at Sunnyside.

444
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:33,395
You see, I've been
sleeping in my office
down at the paper,

445
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,439
and it's just getting a little
chilly at night.

446
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,524
I bet your office
beats the trailer park.

447
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,443
I wouldn't be so sure.

448
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:43,030
You see, Alice here,
she's been redecorating
the <i>Register.</i>

449
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:46,158
The other day, she threw
a brick through the window.

450
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,784
- Is that so?
- Keep talking, Hal,

451
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:50,329
and the next brick I throw
may not be at a window.

452
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:54,333
You remember
our Homecoming, Alice?

453
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,959
Hal? Back in the day?

454
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:57,377
Castles in the Clouds?

455
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:58,879
Your mom ever tell you
about that night?

456
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,590
Just that she and my dad
were king and queen.

457
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,175
Yeah, they were. Of hell.

458
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,802
- Dad, please.
- No, this is a fun story,
I promise.

459
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:08,180
Fred and me,

460
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,433
we were all set
to play at the dance.

461
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,727
I was backstage,
dropping off our gear

462
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:16,146
when I heard
these voices yelling.

463
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,024
It was your mom and dad.

464
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:20,609
They were fighting about...

465
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:24,654
About I don't know what.

466
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:25,906
But it sounded like
life or death.

467
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,199
Shut up, FP.

468
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,867
Happy to oblige if you are.

469
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:34,706
I don't care what you
think of me, Alice,

470
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,793
but don't jerk me around.
Not in front of my son.

471
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:41,963
This was such
a nice idea, Mom,

472
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,049
but I think it's time that
we get to the dance.

473
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,176
So, is it okay if we
skip the peach pie?

474
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,682
What did you give her?

475
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:56,937
Polly was so agitated,
I gave her an
all-natural relaxer.

476
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,438
Nothing to hurt the babies,

477
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,690
but she will sleep
like a lamb till morning.

478
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,652
Was that story true?

479
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,986
About how you
got the ring back?

480
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,072
Every word of it.

481
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,742
You know,
your brother rejected us,

482
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,911
our way of life,
our business, everything.

483
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,415
And after I had groomed him
to take over the empire.

484
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,335
When really, I should have
been nurturing you.

485
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,671
Jason never had
the stomach for any of it.

486
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,005
But you...

487
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,968
You're a Blossom,
through and through.

488
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,138
Okay.

489
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:33,473
One more thing
before you go to the dance.

490
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,684
Nana Blossom's ring...

491
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:39,604
It's not in my jewelry box,
it's not with Polly.

492
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:41,523
Where is it?

493
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,860
It wasn't my fault,
it was Polly's.

494
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,611
She lunged at me,
trying to get it,

495
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,155
I didn't know what to do.

496
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,406
<i>I panicked.</i>

497
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:50,824
<i>I thought it would be
better for everyone</i>

498
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,534
<i>if the ring were just gone.</i>

499
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,035
<i>Down the drain.</i>

500
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:56,663
<i>That way, if Polly ever
said anything to anyone,</i>

501
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:59,958
there'd be no proof.
Just her word

502
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:01,918
against ours.

503
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,381
Did I do something wrong?

504
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:07,591
No...

505
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,926
It's quite right what you did.

506
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,742
Look, I checked everywhere.
Twice.

507
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,327
But there's nothing weird
or dangerous-looking.

508
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,288
Same out here,
just tumbleweeds
and dust bunnies, that's it.

509
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:40,582
- We need to keep looking.
- Veronica.

510
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,751
- Somewhere, there's
something that proves it.
- What?

511
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,628
What are we even
looking for, Ronnie?

512
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,421
A signed contract between
Jughead's dad and yours?

513
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,714
I doubt they're that stupid...

514
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:49,591
We'll switch... I'll take
the bedroom this time.

515
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,677
You wanted to see if we would
find anything incriminating,
and we didn't.

516
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:53,845
Then we'll look
somewhere else.

517
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,514
Outside or under the trailer.

518
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:56,973
Veronica,

519
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:58,266
what do you want?

520
00:25:58,475 --> 00:25:59,684
Do you want your dad
to be guilty?

521
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,145
I want to know, Archie.

522
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:04,189
One way or the other,
I need to be sure.

523
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,525
We can keep looking
forever, Ronnie,

524
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:07,859
and never find anything.

525
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,361
Then what about
when he comes home?

526
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,612
I'm not sure.

527
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,490
But I'll be right
there, next to you,

528
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,867
doing what I can
to help. If you'll let me.

529
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,203
And maybe I'm wrong,

530
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,872
but not finding anything
tonight feels like a win.

531
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,459
A major win for the home team.

532
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,878
What?

533
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:28,964
Just...

534
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,551
"Yea, though I walk through
the Valley of Darkness,

535
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:37,556
"and Archie Andrews
is there with a smile
and a sports metaphor."

536
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,402
It's Mrs. Cooper.

537
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,778
We need to go, right now.

538
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,196
FP could be on his way home,
let's go.

539
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,005
You be a gentleman
tonight, okay?

540
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:11,464
He always is, Mr. Jones.

541
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:17,262
Betty, would you mind
giving us just a minute?

542
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,930
No, of course. Take your time.
Thank you.

543
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:26,980
What's up?

544
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,024
Look, I've been thinking.

545
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,110
I mean, if it's
all right with you...

546
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:35,739
I could come back.

547
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,575
And I could... I could
come back home.

548
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:41,536
I'll do you one better.

549
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,456
It's time the whole family
gets back together.

550
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,916
Us, your mom, Jellybean.

551
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,294
They've got a
sweet set-up in Toledo,

552
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,087
- there's decent work there...
- In Toledo?

553
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:53,798
Well, why not Riverdale?

554
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,634
'Cause of dinners
like we just had.

555
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,761
And what you're writing
about in your book.

556
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:00,388
And hell, you know
what happens to people
like us in Riverdale, Jug.

557
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,432
We get chewed up.

558
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:16,780
Well, it's not
the Met Ball, but...

559
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,491
Thanks for letting me
tag along, Fred.

560
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,117
It was Mary's idea.

561
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,662
Always like to have a
beautiful woman on my arm.

562
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,996
Tonight, I have two.

563
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,874
Meanwhile, I'm having
major deja vu.

564
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:29,542
Remember when
this was our lives?

565
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,336
The best of times...

566
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:35,256
Betty, tonight after
the dance, I'd like to talk
to you about something.

567
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:36,633
It has to do with my dad.

568
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,134
Is everything okay?

569
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:39,511
Yeah...

570
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,304
Actually, things are great.

571
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:42,972
Better than they've been
in a while.

572
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:44,349
I just kind of wanna figure
something out together.

573
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,475
Mmm-hmm.

574
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:47,394
Oh, God...

575
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:48,937
Will you be okay alone
here for a second?

576
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,146
I think I should be fine.

577
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:52,315
I'll be right back.

578
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,695
Cheryl? Hey. Where's Polly?

579
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:57,946
She's fine.

580
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:00,907
She sugar-crashed and
canceled at the last minute,

581
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,200
leaving me high and dry,

582
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:06,037
which is why I'm never
doing anything nice
for anyone ever again.

583
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:07,539
Excuse me.

584
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:16,423
Well, well, well...
Mary Andrews.

585
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,259
Well, well, well...
Alice Cooper.

586
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,553
Saw you swanning in earlier
with Fred and Hermione.

587
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,389
I didn't realize that you were
a polyamorist.

588
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,725
I don't think that's
an actual word.

589
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,393
- It's a compliment, Mary.
- Huh.

590
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,228
I couldn't be seen in the
same room with those two.

591
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,230
Not after all their
monkey business.

592
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,275
Oh...

593
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:36,735
Oh... Did you not know?

594
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:39,028
You have been playing
the same game
since junior high

595
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:41,239
and it was tired
even back then.

596
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,075
Fred is a big boy,
he can do as he pleases.

597
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,495
I came here tonight
to have fun
with both of my dates.

598
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:48,913
So, if you have
a problem with that...

599
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:51,791
I have to take this.

600
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:57,589
Hey, Kev...

601
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,257
Have you seen Archie
and Veronica?

602
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:02,510
Oh, never mind, I see them.

603
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:10,560
What the hell?

604
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,445
There you are, Ms. Cooper.

605
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,281
Mayor McCoy would like
to review the evening's
itinerary with you.

606
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,949
What can I do for you,
Mayor McCoy?

607
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:27,744
Well, firstly,
I was wondering...

608
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:48,431
- Would you walk me up?
- I'm sorry. What?

609
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,557
To the stage?

610
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:50,683
Oh...

611
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,102
Actually,
Principal Weatherbee,
will you do the honors?

612
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:54,646
I have to... Go.

613
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:55,814
Excuse me.

614
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:01,986
Where were you guys?

615
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,074
We stopped...
We stopped at Pop's.

616
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,575
And what were you
just talking to my mom about?

617
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:09,536
- Betty...
- Guys, can we table this?

618
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:10,703
We gotta get ready.

619
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:11,621

670

We haven't exactly had
the conversation,

671
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,980
but the Magic 8-Ball says,
"Yes."

672
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:27,483
You Andrews men
are such players.

673
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:36,784
This is the first time
I've brought a boyfriend
to one of these things.

674
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:39,954
This is the first time
I've really had a boyfriend.

675
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:43,458
Mostly it's been hook-ups
with closeted guys.

676
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,336
Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt.

677
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:48,713
Have you seen Betty anywhere?

678
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,590
You all need tracking devices.

679
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:53,760
I think she was headed out
to the hall with Veronica
and maybe Archie.

680
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:54,886
Thanks.

681
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,440
Before you get mad,
let me explain.

682
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,816
Explain what?

683
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:10,735
That you're working with
my mom behind my back?

684
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:14,113
I'm sorry, Bee, but you know
FP had some kind of
arrangement with my dad.

685
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:16,115
I had to make sure it wasn't
about Jason Blossom.

686
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:17,575
And what's your excuse?

687
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:20,244
I was looking out for
Jughead in case FP
was doing shady stuff.

688
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:22,121
- To protect him.
- Blame me, Betty.

689
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,539
I asked Archie to help me.

690
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:26,584
Help you do what?
What did you two do?

691
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,544
Guys... Betty...

692
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:34,175
What's going on?

693
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:36,594
Why do I feel like I'm
suddenly left out?

694
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:42,475
Do you want to tell him
or should I?

695
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,268
Tell me what?

696
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:50,483
We went to your
dad's trailer to...

697
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:51,984
To search it, Jughead.

698
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,696
- Why would you guys do that?
- My mom put them up to it.

699
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:58,032
She was
convinced he was hiding
something about Jason.

700
00:35:58,241 --> 00:36:00,660
We were wrong. All of us.
We didn't find anything.

701
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:02,328
And Jug, we were only
doing it to prove that...

702
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:04,122
That my dad wasn't a murderer?

703
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,960
- You went behind
my back, Archie?
- Jug...

704
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,337
How did you...

705
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:13,506
When did you guys know
to go to my dad's trailer?

706
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:15,091
We knew he'd be
at dinner with...

707
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,511
No...

708
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:26,144
That's why your mom invited
my dad and I to dinner?

709
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,854
So these two could
break into his trailer

710
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,272
while she interrogated him?

711
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,482
No, I didn't know
what they were doing.

712
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,070
But yes, that is why
she invited you guys.

713
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:40,408
To think I was gonna pass
on moving to Toledo

714
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,243
with my family for you.

715
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,287
What?

716
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:47,331
When we went to my
dad's trailer, you asked
me if I believed him.

717
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:49,584
I said I did.

718
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:52,879
- Wasn't that
good enough for you?
- It was. It was good enough.

719
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,381
I didn't...
I tried to stop her.

720
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,009
You could've told me,
you could've warned
me about this.

721
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:02,054
You were so excited, Jug,
I didn't want to
disappoint you.

722
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,848
So instead you lied?

723
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,933
- You all lied to me?
- There they are.

724
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:09,228
- Betty. Thank God...
- Mom, don't...

725
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:11,731
No, you have to listen.
All of you.

726
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,399
My dad just told Mayor McCoy

727
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:15,067
about your dad, Jughead.

728
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:16,736
What about my dad?

729
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:18,237
He was just arrested.

730
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,199
For the murder of
Jason Blossom.

731
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:02,323
I'm not a perfect father,
Jughead, no getting
around that, but...

732
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:04,617
<i>I'm no killer.</i>

733
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,510
Kevin said someone tipped off
his dad, was it you?

734
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:26,264
- I was at the dance, Betty...
- Answer the damn
question, Mom.

735
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:27,390
And don't lie.

736
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:29,684
Was it you?

737
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:31,936
It was not.

738
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:33,729
But I'm glad that you're safe.

739
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:35,648
And as much as I like Jughead,

740
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:38,651
- I am so glad that you are
done with that family.
- "Done"?

741
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:40,403
I love Jughead.

742
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:44,198
He's as much my
family as you are,

743
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:46,075
more so right now.

744
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:48,077
You are not going anywhere,
young lady.

745
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:49,453
I am going to look
for Jughead.

746
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:52,707
Do not push me tonight, Mom,

747
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,544
because I will push back.

748
00:39:07,555 --> 00:39:11,100
If FP confesses, he might
drag us into this.

749
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:14,145
Talk about our dealings
with the Serpents.

750
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:17,982
But at least we'll know
if Dad hired him to...

751
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:21,569
And if he did?

752
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,279
And you can't
pretend otherwise?

753
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,282
We'll cut all ties with him.

754
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:29,577
He'll be dead to us.

755
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:32,663
We may not be able
to walk away so easily.

756
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,382
FP has always
had his demons.

757
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:46,218
I really thought he'd
changed, Mom, I...

758
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:49,597
It's very hard for people
to change, Archie.

759
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:52,933
You know, after
I heard you play

760
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:54,560
and before everything
happened,

761
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,730
I was going to ask you
to come to Chicago with me.

762
00:39:58,689 --> 00:39:59,648
To stay.

763
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,652
You could study music.

764
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:06,238
I'm not even thinking
about that right now, Mom.

765
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:07,740
No, I know, I know.

766
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:09,909
It's just,
I want you with me.

767
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,995
I don't think that this town
is safe anymore.

768
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:16,957
I feel like Riverdale is
getting ready to
slide off of a mountainside,

769
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,585
and I don't want you anywhere
around when that happens.

770
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:23,798
Just promise me you'll
at least think about it.

771
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:27,510
Yeah, I will.

772
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,193
That bastard
killed my baby.

773
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,988
He killed my Jason.

774
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:51,742
I want him dead
for what he did.

775
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:53,661
You have my word, darling.

776
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:56,831
You have my word.

777
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:12,763
Pop... Jughead hasn't
been by, has he?

778
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:16,100
Nope. You're not the
only one who's come
looking for him.

779
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:20,229
Betty...

780
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:21,856
- Thank goodness.
- We were gonna call you.

781
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:25,484
I'm not talking to you,
either of you, ever again.

782
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:27,194
It's about Jughead.

783
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:29,447
Kevin called me. And he said
his dad found a gun,

784
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:31,198
the gun that killed Jason,

785
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:32,533
in a lockbox in FP's closet.

786
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,076
But Betty, we searched
FP's trailer.

787
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:35,536
We looked through that closet.

788
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,163
And there was no lockbox.

789
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:40,249
Someone put it there
after we left.

790
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:41,667
He's being framed.
