1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:02,379
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:03,964
You know that SoDale contract?

3
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:05,674
It was awarded
to Andrews Construction.

4
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,968
Mr. Andrews still doesn't know
that Daddy is the buyer?

5
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:10,762
I asked around
about those bruisers
going after your crew.

6
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:13,682
Pretty sure we both know
who has business in Montreal.

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,266
Hiram, why would he even...

8
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:18,019
Maybe he got a whiff
of your little romance
with Freddy Andrews?

9
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:19,729
When my father got arrested,

10
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:21,564
I made a pact to become
a better person.

11
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,984
You're the bravest
of them all, Ethel Muggs.

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,111
You hate the Blossoms

13
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:28,405
<i>and now Polly is pregnant
with his baby.</i>

14
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:29,864
Polly is moving home.

15
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:35,495
I will not be party
to raising a child
that has Blossom blood.

16
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:37,998
<i>Thicker than blood.</i>

17
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,666
<i>More precious than oil.</i>

18
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:43,086
<i>Riverdale's big business
is maple syrup.</i>

19
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:44,838
<i>Since the town's founding,</i>

20
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:48,133
<i>one family has controlled
its lucrative syrup trade,</i>

21
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:49,718
<i>the Blossoms.</i>

22
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:52,095
<i>They were a part of the fabric
of our daily lives...</i>

23
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:54,723
<i>Rich or poor, old or young,</i>

24
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:57,642
<i>we consumed Blossom syrup
by the bucket.</i>

25
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:01,312
<i>That sickly, sweet smell
was inescapable.</i>

26
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:07,110
<i>The death of Jason Blossom
precipitated a crisis.</i>

27
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,070
<i>With the heir apparent gone,</i>

28
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:12,073
<i>who would inherit
the family business one day?</i>

29
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:13,950
<i>Certainly not Cheryl.</i>

30
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,830
<i>It was a question that brought
the wolves to Riverdale.</i>

31
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:21,207
<i>And now, the Blossoms
were circling the wagons</i>

32
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,667
<i>against possible attack,</i>

33
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,878
<i>from within their own ranks.</i>

34
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:28,256
<i>Polly won't answer
my calls or e-mails.</i>

35
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:30,550
I mean, I get that she doesn't
want to talk to my dad,

36
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,677
but what did I do wrong?

37
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:33,636
Nothing.

38
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,014
We'll figure it out.

39
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:37,766
Come here.

40
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,437
Up and at 'em,
breakfast is ready.

41
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:43,688
I'm not hungry.

42
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:45,440
Oh, enough is enough,
Elizabeth,

43
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:46,816
we have a big week
ahead of us.

44
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:50,153
The Blossoms have always been
a thorn in our side,

45
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,781
ever since, according
to your milquetoast father,

46
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,282
Great-Grandpappy Blossom

47
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:56,493
killed
Great-Grandpappy Cooper.

48
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:59,621
Well, it's about time
someone brings them to heel.

49
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:03,416
I'm writing a searing,
no-holds-barred
takedown of their clan.

50
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,752
And you think that's going
to bring Polly home?

51
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,587
Maybe, maybe not,

52
00:02:07,796 --> 00:02:09,005
but it'll make me feel better.

53
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:12,050
Word has it that
the Blossom board of trustees

54
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:15,595
has descended upon Riverdale
like a cabal of vampires.

55
00:02:15,804 --> 00:02:17,931
Why? Now, that's a story.

56
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,224
I just need to find a way in.

57
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,103
The lawyers
are coming over this week

58
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,230
to take our statements
for your dad's hearing.

59
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:28,608
We're both gonna
have to testify on
your father's behalf.

60
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:31,945
What if they ask
about what he did?

61
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:34,155
Embezzling all that money?

62
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,116
Am I going to have to lie?

63
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:40,411
Well...
We might have to

64
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,580
shade the truth a bit,
Ronnie.

65
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,417
Mom?

66
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:49,587
Baby, I have just made
a mess of things.

67
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:53,550
Your father found out
about Fred and me.

68
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:55,802
Someone went to him

69
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,220
before I got a chance
to say anything...

70
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,264
Oh, my God, Dad knows?

71
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:00,640
Yes, and on top of that,

72
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,976
the Blossoms are still
after the drive-in land,

73
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,687
and Fred still doesn't know
that we own it.

74
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:09,607
Maybe it's time you tell
Mr. Andrews the truth.

75
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:12,193
And risk having him
walk off the project?

76
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:15,363
We've bet everything we have
on the SoDale construction.

77
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:16,823
Mom,

78
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,117
this is a small, gossipy town.

79
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:21,244
You need to tell Fred
about the land

80
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,121
before someone else does.

81
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:30,712
Archie.

82
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:33,506
If music be the food of love,

83
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,592
play on, play on.

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,513
Did you know
this week's
the official start

85
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:41,973
of maple syrup season?

86
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,184
I... No, I didn't.

87
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:46,269
Well, it is.

88
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,813
And every year, we host
a tree-tapping ceremony,

89
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:51,399
a tradition that honors
the Blossom bloodline.

90
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:52,525
Our heritage.

91
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:54,194
Sounds cool.

92
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:55,987
It is. Beyond.

93
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:59,407
It's also
incredibly exclusive.

94
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,826
Family and inner circle only.

95
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:04,245
Wanna be my date?

96
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,043
The maple-tapping's something
Jason and I have done together
since we could walk.

97
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,794
It was our
extra-special thing.

98
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,422
But I...

99
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:16,466
I can't face it alone.

100
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,093
If you came,

101
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:20,845
as my escort,

102
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:23,473
I think
I could get through it.

103
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:28,144
Cheryl, I would love to help,
but I have a girlfriend.

104
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:30,647
Maybe invite Kevin? Or Reggie?

105
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,690
You don't get it, do you?

106
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:35,235
I don't want Kevin or Reggie.

107
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:36,527
I want you.

108
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,030
You defended me
to Sheriff Keller

109
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,990
when not even
my parents would.

110
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,245
Never mind, I'm sorry I asked.

111
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,788
Cheryl, hold on.

112
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:54,170
"They put me in a wooden box
as I desperately opposed.

113
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:57,757
"But all my screaming
was for naught.

114
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,884
"My mouth had been
sewn closed.

115
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,930
"Curled up in bed
was just a girl.

116
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:06,766
"Needing Daddy's arms
to hold her."

117
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:11,020
Hey, Ethel.

118
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:16,859
I just wanted to tell you
how moved I was by your poem.

119
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,488
It felt like you were tapping
into something pretty dark,

120
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:22,907
but also pretty real.

121
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,660
And I don't want
to overstep...

122
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:29,038
But is everything
all right, Ethel?

123
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,631
Things at home
aren't great.

124
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:43,011
My mom and dad are fighting,

125
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,805
but they won't tell me
about what.

126
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,852
It's like this really
bad thing is happening,

127
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,104
and there's nothing that
I can do to stop it.

128
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,648
Like you're trapped
in a slow-motion car crash.

129
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,484
Yeah, I know
the feeling.

130
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,236
Listen, Ethel.

131
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,489
It sounds like you
need some cheering up.

132
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:06,659
Which happens to be
a Veronica Lodge specialty.

133
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:07,744
So...

134
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,787
If you're free tomorrow,

135
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:11,789
come over for lunch
and pampering.

136
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:14,375
Kevin will be there.

137
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,337
Yeah, come on, it'll be fun.

138
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,088
Just please say yes.

139
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,966
All right, sure.

140
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:23,676
Yeah?
Yeah.

141
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:25,595
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.

142
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,098
So... What was
that about?

143
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,310
Ethel's poem
was a cry for help

144
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:33,436
if I ever heard one,

145
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,855
the likes of which
I vowed never to ignore,

146
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:37,106
not after...

147
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:39,650
Uh-oh. Do we need to sit down?

148
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,029
Okay, so, last year at Spence,

149
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:47,408
my best friend
Katy and I kind of
terrorized this girl, Paige.

150
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:49,535
One time, we made her
drink gutter water.

151
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,037
Ew! Why?

152
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,747
Because she was there.

153
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,040
Because she was a misfit

154
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,042
and we were class-A
brutal bitches.

155
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:57,960
Anyway, by December,

156
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,504
Paige couldn't take it
anymore...

157
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:02,048
Oh, my God,
did you drive her to suicide?

158
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,257
What? No.

159
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,218
But she did transfer schools.

160
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,552
And went into therapy.

161
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:07,595
So now?

162
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:10,640
If I can make
Ethel Muggs' life
a little better,

163
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,517
even for one afternoon,

164
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,852
I'm going to do it.

165
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:19,482
Archibald.

166
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:22,485
I was going to get
Principal Weatherbee
to summon you.

167
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:24,404
Hey, Mrs. Blossom.

168
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:25,613
Have a moment to chat?

169
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,240
About Cheryl.

170
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,243
I believe she invited you
to our tree-tapping ceremony?

171
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:31,244
Yeah.

172
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,371
She did, and like I told her,

173
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,456
I don't feel
comfortable going.

174
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,834
Cheryl tells me

175
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:40,420
you have a keen
interest in music.

176
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:41,587
Is that true?

177
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:46,134
Did she tell you
her Great-Uncle Harrison

178
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:48,845
sits on the board of
the Brandenburg Music Academy?

179
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:51,973
They have an excellent
summer program, I hear.

180
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,435
It's amazing,
crazy hard to get into.

181
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:57,979
Surely not for
a talent like you.

182
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,898
And especially not
if I put in a word
on your behalf.

183
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,316
Mrs. Blossom...

184
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,110
At Jason's memorial,

185
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,237
you brought me
his football jersey.

186
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,114
So sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Blossom.

187
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,701
I thought you might
want to have this.

188
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,789
That was an act of kindness

189
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:18,458
on a day of despair.

190
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,085
You're good and decent,
Archibald,

191
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:23,087
unlike most
people in this town.

192
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:25,256
Mrs. Blossom,
I don't know what to say.

193
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:29,010
Say you'll reconsider
escorting my daughter
to the tapping.

194
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,803
It's just an afternoon.

195
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,972
And it would mean the world
to my Cheryl.

196
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,102
I mean, yeah. I guess
I could talk to Valerie.

197
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,479
I swear, Archibald,

198
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,063
when the light hits you
just right...

199
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:45,318
I'll tell Cheryl
the good news.

200
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,445
And I'll call
Great-Uncle Harrison.

201
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,867
Just in time,
we're celebrating.

202
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:53,993
Archie was just telling us

203
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:57,079
how he's going to some
super-exclusive music program
this summer.

204
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,540
Maybe. If it happens, though,
it would be huge for me.

205
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:00,791
Do you have
to audition for it?

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,835
Well, not exactly.
Mrs. Blossom came by earlier

207
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,462
and said she'd put
a good word in for me.

208
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,755
Amazing.
Terrifying.

209
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,090
Uh-huh.

210
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,425
What's she getting out of it?

211
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,427
I told her I'd take Cheryl

212
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,095
to their family's
tree-tapping thing.

213
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:14,764
I already talked to Valerie,
and she's cool with it.

214
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,349
Cool with you
being a gigolo now?

215
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,559
I'm doing someone
a favor for my music, Jughead.

216
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,937
I need to make connections
outside of Riverdale.

217
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,271
That's the way of the world.

218
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,356
It's all about connections.

219
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,191
But Jughead's right.

220
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,360
These kinds of favors
always come with a price tag.

221
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:29,529
Betty, back me up here.

222
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,531
I think it's a great idea.

223
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:32,740
Thank you, Betty.

224
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,534
Yeah, and while you're there,

225
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:37,328
would you talk
to Polly for me?

226
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:39,330
I just want to make sure
she's okay.

227
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,332
Definitely.

228
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,084
Thank you.

229
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,671
And don't worry, Ronnie,
I can take care of myself.

230
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,631
Famous last words, Archiekins.

231
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,810
When Jason died,

232
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,770
I thought I'd tapped
my last tree.

233
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:04,063
Now, don't be nervous.

234
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:05,481
All you have to do
is hold the bucket steady,

235
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,899
I'll handle the rest.

236
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,402
Who are all these people?

237
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,528
<i>Entre nous,</i>

238
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,488
they're Daddy's
board of trustees.

239
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,115
They smell blood
in the water.

240
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,575
That's why they're here.

241
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,786
They're worried
Daddy's losing his grip
on the company

242
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,038
and they're looking for a way
to take it away from us.

243
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:22,582
They can do that?

244
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,500
If they all vote together,
they can.

245
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:27,461
When Jason died,
it was a PR debacle.

246
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,423
And now, here's Polly,
pregnant and unwed.

247
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,841
It's no wonder
they've descended upon us

248
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,384
like some biblical plague.

249
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:43,936
"Nearly 100 years ago,
Grandfather Blossom came
to this sacred maple grove.

250
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,230
"The annual tapping ceremony

251
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:48,649
"portends each
season's bounty."

252
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,362
Now, I've performed
this ceremony
many times in my life.

253
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,407
My son Jason,
when he came of age,
performed it as well.

254
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,659
In his place,

255
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,661
I put forth
my daughter Cheryl.

256
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,512
Hey.

257
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,223
You can do this in your sleep.

258
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,193
- Bravo!
- Well done!

259
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,200
Good shot. Nice.

260
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,828
Mrs. Lodge,
this Quiche Lorraine
is to die for.

261
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,538
Ethel,

262
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:45,623
you haven't eaten at all.

263
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,291
Oh. Sorry. I just...

264
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,584
I'm not really hungry.

265
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:50,503
Anything we can help with?

266
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,214
Uh, my parents...

267
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,425
All they do is
yell at each other.

268
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:59,428
My parents are fighting
right now, too.

269
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,889
It's terrible.

270
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:05,976
I think my dad had some
bad luck with our savings.

271
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:09,855
Now my mom says
we're going to have
to sell the house.

272
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,732
My dad is just so...

273
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,818
Crushed.

274
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,320
I wish there was something
I could do to help him.

275
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,156
Girl, we have a lot more
in common than I thought.

276
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,451
We lost our place
at the Dakota.

277
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:26,247
Look, being ruined sucks.

278
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:29,125
But you have your family
and you have us.

279
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,127
You've got this, Ethel Muggs.

280
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,130
"Muggs"?

281
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,340
Uh, it's Dutch.

282
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:37,633
We lost the third "G"

283
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,593
when my Grandpa Manfred
came over.

284
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,973
Archibald! Come join us
before the snow starts again.

285
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,192
Polly.

286
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,027
Betty's worried about you.

287
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:58,571
Why won't you call
or e-mail her?

288
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,656
She fought for you, Polly,

289
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,575
and now you're treating her
like she's the enemy.

290
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,910
Polly, come along.

291
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,331
Tell Betty that
she shouldn't worry, okay?

292
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,502
Veronica, there's something
that you need to know

293
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,671
about that Muggs girl.
What?

294
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,465
Her father, Manfred Muggs,

295
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:18,924
invested with your dad.

296
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,552
And it's probable
that they lost a lot

297
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:24,430
when your father
was arrested.
Maybe everything.

298
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,474
Mom, they're being kicked out
of their house,

299
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:27,558
their home.

300
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:28,893
Well, from what
I've been told,

301
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,186
the Muggs family is going
to testify

302
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,312
against your father.

303
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,396
They should.

304
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:34,440
How many, Mom?

305
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,859
How many families
like Ethel's?

306
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:40,321
It's the risk
of doing business
with your father.

307
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,406
Could Mr. Andrews lose
everything,

308
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,825
for doing business
with you and Dad?

309
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:46,202
I'm not sure.

310
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,579
My God.

311
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,591
I don't buy this
dog-and-pony show
for a second.

312
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,176
Cliff can't control
his own family,

313
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,260
let alone the company.

314
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:04,386
Agreed.

315
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,056
And if he tries
to put Cheryl forward
as a successor...

316
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:08,891
Do you remember what she did
at the funeral?

317
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,601
Crocodile tears.
Hey.

318
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,769
Archie,
you don't have to.

319
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,646
No, Cheryl loved Jason.

320
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,565
What was she meant to do
at his funeral, not cry?

321
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,192
And yeah, Jason
was on the football team,

322
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,194
but Cheryl was at
every single game, too,

323
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,154
doing as much to help
the Bulldogs win as he did.

324
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:23,572
Also, 4.0.

325
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:25,866
Also, she has
a 4.0 grade point average.

326
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,202
If there's one thing
that I've learned
being in Cheryl's class,

327
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,246
it's don't underestimate her

328
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:32,081
and don't bet against her.

329
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,464
Fred, we need to talk.

330
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,093
Oh, God.

331
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,222
Hiram and I,

332
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:51,600
we are the anonymous buyers.

333
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,105
You're working
for Lodge Industries.

334
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,440
How do you not tell me that?

335
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,734
You never would
have gotten involved.

336
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:01,902
You're damn straight.

337
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:03,028
Because I didn't sign up

338
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,614
to go into business
with a criminal
like Hiram Lodge.

339
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:09,076
I'm trying to turn
Lodge Industries legitimate.

340
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,787
That means partnering
with people like you,

341
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:13,706
good people.

342
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,835
This is why Cliff Blossom
bought out my crew?

343
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:21,130
Sent thugs
to beat up teenagers?

344
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,425
Clifford didn't send
those thugs.

345
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,927
Hiram did.

346
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,555
He was trying to stop us.

347
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,433
He found out
about you and me
from Clifford.

348
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,435
So you have
dragged me into a war

349
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,313
between Hiram and Clifford,
that's great.

350
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,981
I know you're angry.

351
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,191
And I know that I have
no right to ask this...

352
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,987
But please
stay on this project.

353
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,281
If you jump ship,
I can't start over
with someone else.

354
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,991
So, I do the grunt work

355
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,659
while your husband's
taking potshots at me

356
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,578
and you're playing both sides?

357
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:53,704
The whole time?

358
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,248
I gotta take a walk.

359
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:02,463
Archibald, do you know,
when Cheryl told me

360
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,089
that she wanted you
to come with us,

361
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,883
I was a little taken aback.

362
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:10,095
Your father and I haven't been
seeing eye-to-eye lately.

363
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,139
I came for Cheryl,
Mr. Blossom.

364
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:14,016
And because I'm grateful
for what Mrs. Blossom
is doing for me.

365
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,143
The music academy, you mean?

366
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:18,771
Yeah, that would be quite
a feather in your cap,
now, wouldn't it?

367
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,357
You know, we can be
extremely generous,

368
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,776
Archibald,
to the right people.

369
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,154
Now later this week,
we're hosting
a banquet for the board

370
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:28,656
at the Belmont Lodge.

371
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,282
It's a simple thing,
a little dinner,

372
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:32,117
chit-chat, dancing.

373
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:35,162
We would love you to attend
as Cheryl's escort.

374
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:36,956
You two make quite the pair.

375
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:40,668
Oh, I'm honored,
Mr. Blossom, really, but...

376
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,252
But nothing.

377
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,214
You have to come,
I'm wearing viridian.

378
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:46,924
He'll need a proper suit,
don't you think, Daddy?

379
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,258
I'll have my tailor fit you.

380
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,303
If that's not
a problem?

381
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:56,517
No. No, no, it's just...

382
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,602
I'm an Andrews, Mr. Blossom,
like you said.

383
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,646
My dad works construction,

384
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,107
a fancy banquet's
not really our thing.

385
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,858
That's precisely
why you should come.

386
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,070
People like you
are the bedrock of our town.

387
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,364
You're hard workers.

388
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,908
Plus, I need a dance partner.

389
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,494
We won't take no
for an answer...

390
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,539
Archiekins.

391
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,842
Who would've
predicted this?

392
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,220
Archie Andrews
is our fox in the henhouse.

393
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:34,888
Tell us about Polly.

394
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,849
How is she? Did she seem okay?

395
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,475
The Blossoms
are treating her great.

396
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,352
But, Betty, I don't think
she's coming back.

397
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:41,895
I don't think she wants to.

398
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,815
That doesn't make any sense.
That's not Polly.

399
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:46,608
She made her choice.

400
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,236
We have to learn
to live with that.

401
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,406
No. I know my sister.
She wouldn't do that to us.

402
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,116
Something else is going on.

403
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,617
What else
did you see, Archie?

404
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,786
When you were in
the sticky, red thick of it?

405
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,329
Anything about the board?

406
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,081
Cheryl said that
they're worried...

407
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,376
That after all the scandal
with Jason and Polly,

408
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,921
that they might try and steal
the company from Mr. Blossom.

409
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,340
Well, do you hear that, Betty?

410
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,719
This is our story.
A hostile takeover.

411
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,305
No wonder
the trustees are in town.

412
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,348
The Blossom empire
is crumbling.

413
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:19,641
Okay, but, Mom,

414
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,769
if you write a story
attacking them

415
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,562
while Polly's
still in Thornhill...

416
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:25,147
Enough about Polly.

417
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,648
I mean it.

418
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:27,900
She's the one
that betrayed us,

419
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,151
not the other way around.

420
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,238
Obviously she's jealous...

421
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,448
Cheryl,

422
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:36,325
can we have a word?

423
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,994
Scatter, my Vixens.

424
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,623
Yes, Betty? What is it?

425
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:44,625
Polly.

426
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:50,589
Look, I don't know what kind
of Stockholm syndrome
spell you've cast on her,

427
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:52,466
but I want
to talk to my sister.

428
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:54,510
Let's not fight.

429
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,512
Especially not when
we should be celebrating.

430
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,013
Why? What happened?

431
00:18:58,222 --> 00:18:59,223
Haven't you heard?

432
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,433
Dr. Patel just
confirmed it
this morning.

433
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,685
Polly is having twins.

434
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,604
Bless our Blossom genes!

435
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,898
And she didn't call
to tell me.

436
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:09,525
Hostages aren't
normally allowed

437
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,110
to make outgoing calls.

438
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,487
Can you please just give her
a message for me?

439
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,697
As long
as it doesn't upset her.

440
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,658
Tell her she
should call our mom.

441
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,160
She's trying really
hard to hide it,

442
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:23,288
but I can tell she's really,
really hurt and upset.

443
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,541
I'll pass your
message along...
Thank you.

444
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:26,625
If I remember.

445
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:27,709
Cheryl.

446
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,586
That was a joke, you hobo.

447
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,214
Of course I'll give her
your message, Betty.

448
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,758
But no promises
that she'll care
or respond.

449
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,055
<i>Okay, Ethel,</i>

450
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,682
open your eyes.

451
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,061
What is happening?

452
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,563
I was purging my closet,

453
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,815
thinking how you
would look magnificent

454
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,358
in some of these.

455
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:53,944
Here, try this on.

456
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,032
This is... This is so nice.

457
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:03,287
And I love this.
It is so you, Ethel.

458
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,207
Ronnie, I can't take all this.

459
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,042
I want you to have it.

460
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:11,753
These things...

461
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,506
My dad gave them to me.

462
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,758
He always brought home gifts

463
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,595
whenever he
did something wrong.

464
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:23,765
As a way to
make up for it,
I guess.

465
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,267
Did it work?

466
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,937
What girl is immune
to the charms
of a Givenchy bag?

467
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,733
And I still wear
these pearls he gave me.

468
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,320
Okay, but...

469
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,488
You don't have to do anything.

470
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,657
Give me anything.

471
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,327
I just want to be friends.

472
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,872
Me, too, Ethel.

473
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,088
Mr. Andrews! Nice haircut.

474
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,382
You're looking extremely
DILF-y today.

475
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:58,717
Is Archie home?

476
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,636
Cheryl, yes.

477
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,721
Um, come on in.

478
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,726
The Ice Woman cometh.

479
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,354
Hey, Cheryl.

480
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,189
As a maj thank-you
for coming

481
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,107
to the maple banquet
with me tomorrow,

482
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,276
I wanted to give you this.

483
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,404
An '84 Les Paul.

484
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:20,614
In our signature color.

485
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:21,782
You're welcome.

486
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,954
Okay. That's all.
I'm going now.

487
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,373
My claustrophobia acts up
in small houses.

488
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,833
See you tomorrow.

489
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,801
I'd give that back
if I were you.

490
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:43,053
Dad, come on.
The Blossoms,

491
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:44,888
they're helping me
get into that
summer music program.

492
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:46,181
Like, the best in the country.

493
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,474
And since
when did the Blossoms

494
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,518
ever give a damn
about you, Archie?

495
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,186
Well, they think
I have potential, Dad.

496
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,563
He's also pimping himself
out to Cheryl.

497
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:57,234
The Blossoms tried to run
our business into the ground.

498
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,361
Maybe if you tried talking
to Mr. Blossom...

499
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:00,862
I tried talking to him,
Archie,

500
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,281
he laughed in my face.

501
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,867
Don't think for a second
that the Blossoms
are looking out for you.

502
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,286
They're using you, Archie.

503
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,914
They look at us like
we're dirt under their shoe.

504
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,667
I'm over it.

505
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,761
What's this?

506
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,930
The biggest story
we've ever broken.

507
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:29,099
A tell-all expose
on the Blossom clan

508
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:31,059
and all of their
glorious corruption.

509
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,436
Um, would you mind telling me

510
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,187
what your mother
is talking about?

511
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,231
It's time that
they finally answer

512
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,899
to everything
that they've done to us,

513
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,609
including taking Polly.

514
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:42,279
By the way, Polly's living
with the Blossoms now,

515
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,990
so congratulations,
you've finally got
what you wanted.

516
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,533
She's officially out
of our lives.

517
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:49,870
I'm not publishing
your personal vendetta.

518
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:52,956
Well, it's a good thing
I don't need your permission.

519
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,299
What did you do, Hal?

520
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:04,259
Well, you kicked me out.

521
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,762
So, now, I'm kicking you out.

522
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:10,515
If we expose
the Blossoms, maybe...

523
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:13,435
Just maybe, we might
have a chance in hell

524
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:14,811
to get our daughter back.

525
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,064
You are done here,
Alice. You're fired.

526
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,903
Fine, Hal.

527
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,083
What?

528
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:44,591
I want my daughter back,
you bastard!

529
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,307
Mom!

530
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:02,192
Black piping
for the velvet, of course.

531
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:03,944
I'll take measurements
for the pants.

532
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,404
Uh, before we do that...

533
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,658
Could I talk to you,
Mr. Blossom?

534
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:19,251
Things aren't going great
at my dad's company.

535
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:22,587
And I know you two have
been at odds recently.

536
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:26,174
But I was wondering,
instead of helping me
with that music school, if...

537
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,719
Maybe you could
help my dad.

538
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:31,763
Are you negotiating
on behalf of your father?

539
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:35,142
No, no, I'm impressed.

540
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,896
In fact, I'm trying to imagine
if Jason would ever have

541
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,314
given up something
like that for me,

542
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,649
and I don't believe so.

543
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,610
It speaks to
your character, son.

544
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:47,863
But I'll tell you what,

545
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,823
we've already called
the Brandenburg Music Academy.

546
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,616
And they're very excited
to meet you, by the way.

547
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,454
Let's just get through
this banquet, all right?

548
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,955
Sit down man-to-man

549
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,374
and discuss what I can do
for Fred Andrews.

550
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:02,419
Is it satisfactory?

551
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:07,507
It's more than satisfactory.

552
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:10,010
My parents
are unbelievable, Jug.

553
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,636
Polly is locked up
in that house

554
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,221
like a character
out of <i>Jane Eyre,</i>

555
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,848
and what are they doing?

556
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:16,725
Changing each other's
login accounts

557
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,602
and throwing bricks
through windows.

558
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,853
I wish I'd seen that.

559
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:23,857
Okay, I'm sorry,
that's not funny.

560
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,400
It's like, you know
how, in a time of crisis,

561
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,195
people either come together
or fall apart?

562
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,074
It feels like
we're falling apart.

563
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:35,535
And the way things
are going, pretty soon,

564
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,121
the Coopers, we're not gonna
exist anymore.

565
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,915
And there's nothing
I can do to stop that.

566
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,208
Betty, don't do that.

567
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:42,334
Don't give up.

568
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,879
Your family is definitely
splintering right now,

569
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,256
but it won't fall apart,
because of you.

570
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,842
Because you're holding
them together.

571
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,054
You're so much stronger

572
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:55,680
than all of the white noise.

573
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,725
You're stronger
than your mother,

574
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:00,352
you're stronger
than your father.

575
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,688
You're holding
this family together.

576
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,359
So don't.

577
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,362
Don't let go.

578
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,073
I won't.

579
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,500
Valerie, hi.

580
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,001
I thought you should know,

581
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,836
Cheryl poured some
insane poison into my ear

582
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,421
about how close
you two are getting.

583
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,341
She legit thinks she's
going to steal you away
from me or something.

584
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,927
No, she doesn't.
Yes, she does.

585
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,762
And I don't blame her.

586
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,723
The new guitar, the new suit?

587
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,101
The Blossoms
are buying you.

588
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:43,103
For one night,
if it helps my dad

589
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,729
and gets me into
that music program...

590
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,940
Wouldn't you rather earn
your place at that table?

591
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:47,983
With your music?

592
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,318
All the Blossoms are doing
is opening a door for me.

593
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,112
What would you do
if you were in my place?

594
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:53,947
If you have to ask,

595
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,824
then you don't
know me at all, Archie.

596
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,160
<i>Oh, my God,
did you hear?</i>

597
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:01,788
Remember when you went
swooping in to save Ethel,

598
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:04,249
'cause you thought
she might be suicidal?

599
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,668
Oh, no. She didn't...

600
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,670
No, but her dad did.

601
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,715
He accidentally
swallowed a whole
bottle of sleeping pills.

602
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:13,592
He's going to be okay,

603
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,052
but that's why Ethel's
been so sad lately.

604
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,178
Now, everybody knows...

605
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:55,717
We were
tested this year.

606
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,095
As a town, as a company,

607
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:00,889
mainly as a family.

608
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:03,141
And it may not have
been Jason's hand

609
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,435
that staked
the maple this year,

610
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,021
but it was the hand of hope.

611
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,116
Don't think they're
being nice or genuine.

612
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:22,410
They wanted me to fail
at the tree-tapping.

613
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,705
But you're going to help
with all that.

614
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:26,998
I'll do whatever I can.

615
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,418
Archibald, have a word?

616
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:32,671
I'll be right back.

617
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,091
I just wanted to
let you know

618
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,134
that I've decided
to help your father.

619
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,304
You did? You will?

620
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,139
Well, you've helped
our family.

621
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:44,724
Cheryl, especially.

622
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,477
You fit in so well.

623
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,229
I think you and your father

624
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,064
have a very bright
future with us.

625
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:52,190
Thank you, Mr. Blossom.

626
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,234
Oh. "Clifford", please.

627
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:55,985
And just so you know,

628
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:57,737
you don't have
to keep doing me favors.

629
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,280
I like Cheryl.

630
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,574
And I'm happy to be
here for her, as a friend.

631
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,660
You know, I'm going
to be honest with you.

632
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,705
Cheryl's a bright girl,

633
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:09,374
but the Blossom board,
they're very skeptical

634
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:12,836
of having her play
an active role
in the company.

635
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:16,089
Now, someone with your stock
and character by her side,

636
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:19,718
tempering her more
erratic behavior...

637
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,846
You know, it's about...

638
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,640
Creating a picture.

639
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,016
The right picture.

640
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:29,185
Having you with us,
with Cheryl,

641
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:31,104
it tells a very
appealing story.

642
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:32,355
Which is something I think

643
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:33,982
we could all use
right about now.

644
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:37,110
You'll help us, won't you?

645
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,112
Excuse me, Mr. Blossom,

646
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,822
may I have this first dance
with Archie?

647
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,407
I think
that's an excellent idea.

648
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:49,998
Polly, can we talk about
what's going on here?

649
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,042
Just keep dancing.

650
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,419
And smiling.

651
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:58,882
Betty keeps asking
Cheryl about me,

652
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,133
she needs to stop.

653
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,552
As long as she's worried
about you, Polly,
she'll never stop.

654
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,095
Yes, she will...

655
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,931
If I tell you
the real reason
I'm at Thornhill.

656
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,143
The Blossoms had something
to do with Jason's death,

657
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:11,102
I'm sure of it.

658
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:12,979
They threatened him
and I'm gonna prove it.

659
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,397
Is that why you
keep blowing Betty off?

660
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:16,065
It has to be believable.

661
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:17,776
And I don't want her
trying to rescue me.

662
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,487
Can you please
tell her that for me?

663
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,280
I'm so done with this!
Do not make a scene.

664
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:23,990
No, I'm done.
I'm done!
Not now.

665
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,283
Polly, will you excuse me?

666
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,048
Betty.

667
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,258
Veronica, hey.

668
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:43,343
Mom, these are my friends.

669
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,136
This is Betty
and this is Veronica.

670
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,806
Mrs. Muggs.

671
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,140
Ethel...

672
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:51,226
We heard what happened,

673
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:55,063
and we wanted to leave
these flowers with you.

674
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,898
That's very kind.
Thank you.

675
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,149
Please don't...

676
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,610
Don't thank me.

677
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:04,364
We're just so glad
Mr. Muggs is going to be okay.

678
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,199
And we'll see you
at school, Ethel?

679
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:13,623
You don't need
to do this, Vee.

680
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,209
Ethel?

681
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:19,295
Mrs. Muggs?

682
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,174
There's something
I need to tell you.

683
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:31,933
My name is Veronica Lodge.

684
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:35,728
- My father is...
- Hiram Lodge.

685
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:37,897
Hmm.

686
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:41,693
And you're showing
your face here?

687
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,320
Mom, she's my friend.

688
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:45,697
She's not your friend, honey.

689
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,075
Her father is a criminal.

690
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,452
He's the reason Dad
did this to himself.

691
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,039
Ronnie?

692
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:56,249
Is that true?

693
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,168
Yes.

694
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,213
And I am so sorry.

695
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,923
I wish I could do something.

696
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:06,134
"Sorry" isn't good enough.

697
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:09,095
You want to do something?
Tell the truth.

698
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:11,306
Your father is ruining lives.

699
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:14,350
He deserves to sit
behind bars for the rest
of his miserable life.

700
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:21,733
Come on.

701
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:25,570
Come on.

702
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:37,916
Cheryl.

703
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:40,585
You okay?

704
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:42,337
What did my dad
say to you?

705
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:44,964
That everyone thinks
I'm a train wreck?

706
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,347
Jason was the golden boy,

707
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:54,098
but me...

708
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:58,102
People hate me, Archie.

709
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:01,648
And at school,
that's fine, whatever.

710
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:03,775
But this is my family.

711
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,860
Forget them, Cheryl.

712
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:08,321
Forget what they think.

713
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:10,782
I think you're awesome.

714
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:14,452
Oh, Archie,

715
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:18,456
sometimes I think you may
be the only decent person
left in Riverdale.

716
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,833
The only person
who doesn't want
something from me.

717
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,044
Or who doesn't want me
to apologize for who I am...

718
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:25,880
And what I want.

719
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,806
What are you doing?

720
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,268
My lipstick's maple red,
by the way.

721
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,146
In case you're wondering
why it tastes so sweet.

722
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:57,954
They seem satisfied,
but Uncle Bedford keeps asking
about the drive-in land.

723
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,164
I am so close
to getting that land back.

724
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,043
Hermione Lodge will crumble.

725
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,379
Who would
have thought she'd
prove so resourceful?

726
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,464
Maybe you should've sent her
to jail instead of Hiram.

727
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,348
Hey.

728
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:21,894
How was your night?

729
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:33,364
I just got back
from the hospital

730
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:35,533
where Ethel's dad is.

731
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:40,163
Because he tried
to kill himself...

732
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,916
Because of what Daddy did...

733
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,795
And, for all I know,
continues to do.

734
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:55,344
I am done
lying for Dad.

735
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:13,404
Archie!

736
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,950
I thought it was Cinderella
that ran away from the ball,

737
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,660
not Prince Charming.

738
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,621
Cheryl, I can't do this
right now. I'm leaving.

739
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,039
Archie Andrews,

740
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:27,502
if you leave, the radiant sun
that is the Blossom family
stops shining on you.

741
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,629
And everything
we've given you,

742
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:32,340
including Brandenburg,
disappears.

743
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,550
Are you sure
you want to
give that up?

744
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:36,636
Are you sure you want to
do that to your dad?

745
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,680
Cheryl, I came here as a favor
to your mom, to help you.

746
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,810
Oh, Archie,
don't start lying now.

747
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:45,478
You may not
want anything from me,

748
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,355
but you do
from my mom and dad,

749
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,357
that's why you're here.

750
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,068
Which means,

751
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:54,153
as much as I want
you to be better
than everyone else...

752
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,155
You're not.

753
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:57,615
You're just like the others.

754
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,283
I'm sorry, Cheryl...

755
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:00,993
But I can't do this anymore.

756
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:02,954
Goodbye.

757
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,297
Mom?

758
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,842
Archie just called.
He talked to Polly.

759
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,552
She's safe.

760
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:19,846
She's okay, Mom.

761
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:21,430
She didn't choose
the Blossoms over us,

762
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,266
she's actually there
to spy on them.

763
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:40,825
You know, when I
went after this story...

764
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,874
I thought, in the back
of my mind that,

765
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:49,625
"What if this is it?

766
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:51,544
"What if this is
finally the time

767
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:52,920
"that she doesn't come back?"

768
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:55,214
She will, Mom.

769
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:57,967
And right now,
she's our woman
on the inside.

770
00:36:58,176 --> 00:36:59,677
We're going
to write this story.

771
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:02,555
Come write with us

772
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:03,556
at <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

773
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:05,892
The school newspaper?

774
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,102
Yeah, that's what we are.

775
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,063
But I'm pretty sure that
our annual operating budget

776
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,773
is bigger than the <i>Register's.</i>

777
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:29,582
Val.

778
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,250
Val, hey.

779
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:34,795
Look, you were right.

780
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:37,048
About being bought
and taking shortcuts.

781
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:39,175
After last night, I'm done
with the Blossoms, I am.

782
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:42,136
Good for you, Archie,
but I'm done with you.

783
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:45,181
Ever since we started dating
you've ignored me,

784
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:46,807
you've ditched me.

785
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:48,684
Val, please.

786
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:50,269
Let me make it up to you.

787
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:52,813
Sorry, Archie, but unlike you,
I won't be bought.

788
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,030
<i>Just listen, Fred.</i>

789
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,865
So many families
have been hurt
by the Lodges.

790
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:05,034
Now, I don't want yours
to be another one.

791
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:07,245
I've decided to sell
to Clifford...

792
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:08,621
Before it gets any worse.

793
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:09,956
No, you're not.

794
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:11,165
I'm going to stay
with the project.

795
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,626
That's great.

796
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,628
Thank you.

797
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:17,630
Don't thank me.
I'm not doing it for you.

798
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,299
See, from now on,
everything we do
around here

799
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,134
is going to be legal.

800
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:24,220
A hundred percent
above board.

801
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:26,514
Agreed. Of course.

802
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,975
Also, my stake is 20%.

803
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:30,726
If I'm gonna put myself
on the line,

804
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,270
I need some skin in the game.

805
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,606
That's a really big share.

806
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:41,529
I'm sick of you people
using me and my family
as pawns.

807
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:44,323
Sure.

808
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:46,909
Anything else?

809
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:48,286
Yes.

810
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,079
You and me...

811
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:51,664
Whatever was going
on there is over.

812
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,291
Now, we're just
business partners.

813
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:56,711
That's it.

814
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:04,552
Right.

815
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:22,236
Ethel,
I meant what I said.

816
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,615
I'm sorry, Ethel,

817
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:29,910
for everything my family
did to yours.

818
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,877
It's not your fault
what your dad did.

819
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:40,546
And you were there for me
when no one else was.

820
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:43,174
More than once.

821
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,427
Seat's not taken,
if you want it.

822
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:52,099
<i>It seemed that,
for Veronica,</i>

823
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:55,186
<i>the sins of the father
would remain simply that.</i>

824
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,940
<i>While Archie Andrews
returned from the brink</i>

825
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,984
<i>with one more bit of news.</i>

826
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:04,820
At the banquet, I heard
Mr. and Mrs. Blossom talking.

827
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:06,781
It sounded like
Clifford Blossom
was responsible

828
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:09,241
for sending
Veronica's dad to jail.

829
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,035
Oh, my God.

830
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,454
If Clifford sent
Hiram Lodge to jail,

831
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:14,955
tore apart his family,

832
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,501
then maybe Hiram was trying
to do the same thing to him?

833
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,878
Yeah, by going after
what the Blossoms value most,

834
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:23,672
their family, their legacy.

835
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:26,133
That's a motive.

836
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:38,187
<i>Winter had come
early to Riverdale.</i>

837
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,440
<i>Brutal and unforgiving.</i>

838
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,360
Did it work?

839
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:46,278
Are the vultures appeased?

840
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,114
We're not
out of the woods yet.

841
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:49,281
<i>But it would be nothing</i>

842
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,033
<i>compared to the storm
that was gathering.</i>

843
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:55,371
<i>A storm of chaos named...</i>

844
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,498
<i>...Cheryl Blossom.</i>

845
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:02,711
Yes?

846
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,838
Good night, Cheryl.

847
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:06,090
Good night, Pollykins.
