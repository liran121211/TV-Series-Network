1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:02,379
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:04,798
You only have enough
in the bank to cover
three more weeks of payroll.

3
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:06,633
I'm waiting to hear
on this huge bid.

4
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,885
That new development
where the old drive-in
used to be?

5
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:10,512
<i>I kissed Fred Andrews.</i>

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,931
The other thing.
It involves you
forging my signature

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,059
to get Fred Andrews
that stupid contract
to build on Dad's land.

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,313
You hated Jason,
and now Polly is pregnant
with his baby.

9
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:23,066
Of course you can stay.
Anything for
Alice Cooper's daughters.

10
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:25,735
- So where are you
gonna live now?
- I'll figure it out, Dad.

11
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:29,322
He was stealing
from the company
and selling stuff on the side.

12
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:30,740
<i>When someone is drowning,</i>

13
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:33,868
<i>you can try to save them,
but not if they're gonna
drag you down with them.</i>

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,169
<i>The Coopers.</i>

15
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,255
<i>The Stepfords of Riverdale.</i>

16
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,550
<i>High school sweethearts
who got married</i>

17
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,845
<i>and had two beautiful
daughters, Polly and Betty...</i>

18
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:56,224
<i>Until Jason Blossom happened.</i>

19
00:00:57,475 --> 00:01:01,396
<i>And now, we would hear from
the person who was closest
to him those days</i>

20
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,189
<i>leading up to
his disappearance...</i>

21
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:05,567
<i>Polly Cooper.</i>

22
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:10,530
<i>How a casual conversation
turned into an epic,
forbidden romance.</i>

23
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,410
<i>How, for reasons still murky,
their respective parents
tried to tear them apart.</i>

24
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,579
<i>How their break-up
was short-lived,</i>

25
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:20,957
<i>because Polly soon learned
she was pregnant
with Jason's baby.</i>

26
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:25,378
<i>How they became
secretly engaged</i>

27
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:28,381
<i>with his
grandmother's blessing
and her heirloom ring,</i>

28
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,135
<i>and made plans
to run away together,</i>

29
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,138
<i>to start a new life.</i>

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,100
<i>And how their dreams of escape
went up in flames.</i>

31
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:43,938
That was the last day
you saw him?

32
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:46,357
At Pop's, when
he told me the plan,

33
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:47,776
that he was gonna fake
his own death,

34
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:49,194
and then we would meet up.

35
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:52,697
But, before that could happen,
my mom and dad sent me away.

36
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:56,743
One of Jason's teammates said
that before he ran away,

37
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,495
Jason was dealing drugs.

38
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:00,747
Making a one-time delivery.

39
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,875
He needed... We needed money.

40
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:05,668
To get away and to start over.

41
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:09,005
So Riverdale's star football
player becomes a drug mule?

42
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:10,799
He went to a bar on the
other side of the tracks

43
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,468
and made a deal
with some biker gang.

44
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:14,636
The Serpents?

45
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:17,097
He got an address upstate,

46
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:20,058
where he was supposed
to deliver the drugs
in exchange for cash.

47
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,935
The drugs you found
in Jason's car...

48
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,105
- Yeah.
- ...that went up in flames.

49
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,649
Along with everything
I had left of Jason,

50
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,776
including the ring
his nana gave me,

51
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,695
which he was
keeping until...

52
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:36,825
Okay, Sheriff, I think
that's enough for tonight.

53
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,451
I think Polly needs her rest.

54
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:41,162
I'll be in touch, ladies.

55
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:42,914
- I'll show you out.
- Thank you.

56
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,544
We're gonna get you
through this, okay?

57
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:00,306
Gotta stop
blowing me up.
- You're going the wrong way.

58
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,600
- You're going the...
- What are you doing?

59
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:04,352
Come on.

60
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,354
You're the one
who keeps accidentally
killing me.

61
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:07,981
War is hell, Jug.

62
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:11,818
No, Archie,
hell is other people.

63
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,778
Hey, guys,
getting pretty late...

64
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:15,780
And... Whoa!
It's kinda ripe in here.

65
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:16,948
Does someone wanna
open a window?

66
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:17,866
I got it.

67
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,703
- You settling in, Jug?
- Oh, completely.

68
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,664
It's like Archie and I are
just roommates
in a college dorm.

69
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:26,875
Oh, great. What does
that make me, the RA?

70
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,293
No, you're the third roommate.

71
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,462
All right, guys.
I got a big day tomorrow.

72
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,631
Yeah, breaking ground
on the SoDale project, right?

73
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,466
Yeah. Indeed, we are.

74
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,720
Sorry, 'cause I know
it's kind of a sore spot
with you, Jughead,

75
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:40,096
about the drive-in.

76
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:42,807
As long as you build something
beautiful in its place.

77
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:45,852
Well, I don't know
about beautiful,
but it's gonna be big.

78
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,521
- Night, guys.
- Night, Dad.

79
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:56,905
<i>♪ Talking television
at the... ♪</i>

80
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:59,908
Polly's convinced herself
that no one wants her baby.

81
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:03,161
Besides, of course,
the child-snatching
Blossom monsters.

82
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:05,955
- No offense, Cheryl.
- None taken.

83
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:08,082
So your mom and dad want
Polly but not the baby,

84
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,418
and the Blossoms want
the baby and not Polly.

85
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,463
That's a true Gordian knot.

86
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,299
It's an impossible situation.

87
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,717
Betty, come on.

88
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:19,886
An impossible situation
is being invited

89
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,846
to both the <i>Vanity Flair</i>
Oscar party

90
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:24,140
and Elton John's Oscar party
on the same night.

91
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:26,601
Which happened to me
one year, I know.

92
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,395
This is merely
an annoying situation.

93
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:33,107
But luckily, I've been
percolating on an idea,

94
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,235
hellishly simple
in its conception.

95
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,655
What if my mom and I were
to host a baby shower?

96
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:39,739
Count me in.

97
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:42,450
You want Polly to feel loved
and supported, right?

98
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,495
Yeah, but ideally
by her own parents.

99
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,997
Okay, so, baby steps, girl.

100
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:50,667
Get Polly and your parents
in the same room

101
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,627
in a public setting
where they can't fight,

102
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,921
and, <i>voila,</i>
let the healing begin.

103
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,464
Am I expected to
come to this thing?

104
00:04:56,673 --> 00:04:57,382
Of course!

105
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,925
You're Betty's
boyfriend, so...

106
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:02,470
Oh, my God, you guys, relax.

107
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:04,555
It's just a word that starts
with the letter "B."

108
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:07,934
Betty, what do you say?

109
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:10,812
Elizabeth Cooper.

110
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,021
Mom?

111
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,648
I need you and you.

112
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:16,442
Right now.

113
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:23,741
Hey, Vic, I was just getting
ready to come out and walk
you through the day.

114
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:29,330
Hate to do this to you,
Fred, but, um...
I gotta pull my crew.

115
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,584
Before we've even started?
What happened?

116
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,086
Cliff Blossom reached out.

117
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:36,754
Says he's got
a big job coming up.

118
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:37,964
Says he needs us
free and available.

119
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:42,802
Blossom's willing to guarantee
us two years' work,
starting now.

120
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,554
Can't ask my guys to turn
down that kind of money.

121
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,014
No, Vic, I can't.

122
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:47,307
Sorry, Fred.

123
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,856
Sheriff Keller
told us everything.

124
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,191
How you're hiding Polly
at the Pembrooke?

125
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,527
Better than
in an insane asylum.

126
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:01,821
Actually,
Mrs. Cooper, that's on me.

127
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,365
I was the one who suggested
that Polly stay with us.

128
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:06,117
She's trying to help.

129
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:09,329
Unlike you and Dad,
who want Polly to give
the baby up for adoption.

130
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:12,373
Betty, it's what's best
for Polly and the baby.

131
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,417
Mom, that's not your choice.

132
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,670
Your choice is whether
or not you want to be
a part of Polly's life.

133
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:23,134
Veronica and her mom
have offered to host
a baby shower.

134
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:24,969
Well, that is
hardly appropriate!

135
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:26,512
Really?

136
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:29,932
Because I think
it's an amazing idea.

137
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:33,936
You want to be
loving and supportive
like a normal grandmother?

138
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,438
Then, great.

139
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,441
Otherwise, stay away.

140
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:47,283
Don, I just need a few guys
from your crew.

141
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,911
A couple to
get me started.

142
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,914
I did check.
I'll get back to you, Don.

143
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,752
What was that about?

144
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,337
It's all good.

145
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,089
How was your date with Val?

146
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,549
It was good.
I got you some slices.

147
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:08,888
Did something happen at work?

148
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:15,186
Cliff Blossom made my crew
an offer they couldn't refuse
so they walked.

149
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:16,771
Every last one of 'em.

150
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:18,731
Screw em, then.

151
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,692
Anyone who'd rather work
for Clifford Blossom
than you is crazy, Dad.

152
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:26,989
Dad?

153
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,825
What is it?

154
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,828
You always make me talk
to you about my problems.

155
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,708
The business...
It's in trouble, Archie.

156
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,961
Has been for a long time.

157
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,047
Big jobs are just
few and far between.

158
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:45,133
That's why this SoDale thing
is so important to me.

159
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,344
I can't break ground
without a crew,

160
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:51,139
so every day
I'm just hemorrhaging cash.

161
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:55,017
We've got equipment
sitting there, supplies,
bills that are past due.

162
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:58,146
Dad, why didn't you tell me?
I had no idea.

163
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,065
It was never
supposed to get this bad.

164
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:03,985
You work your ass off
to build something,

165
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,863
and in one false step
you could lose everything.

166
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:08,739
No, Dad, you're not
losing anything.

167
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:11,492
We'll figure this out.

168
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,632
A baby shower? Are you sure
that's a good idea? You know--

169
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,217
- It is.
- It's a great idea.

170
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:29,385
What about Mom and Dad?

171
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:32,430
What do you want, honey?
Do you want them to come?

172
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,724
I do. I mean, Mom, at least.

173
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,435
In that case, we'll get
her there somehow.

174
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,061
But I do not want
to fight with her.

175
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,229
You won't.

176
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:43,065
The entire Cooper family will
support you on this, Polly.

177
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,193
I want the Blossoms there.

178
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:47,487
- Cheryl, sure, yeah,
she's on the guest list.
- Cheryl.

179
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,030
And Mrs. Blossom.

180
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,782
She just tried to declare
you an unfit mother.

181
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,577
Well, then this shower
is the perfect opportunity

182
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,329
for me to prove
to her that I'm not.

183
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,124
- Ronnie? A word?
- Hmm?

184
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,709
Sure.

185
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:02,710
Excuse us.

186
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,513
The Blossoms
and the Coopers in our
pre-war apartment?

187
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,139
It'll be a bloodbath!

188
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:16,682
They've been the Hatfields
and the McCoys

189
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,768
since long before Polly
was pregnant.

190
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,312
Plus, I'm trying
to avoid the Blossoms.

191
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:22,855
If they find out
your father is the one

192
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,315
who bought the drive-in,

193
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:25,650
it'll be open war.

194
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:26,692
Against us?

195
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,319
They're making a play
for the land,

196
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:30,363
hoping to stop construction.

197
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,657
Fred and I are trying
to keep it on track, but...

198
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,243
But Mr. Andrews still doesn't
know that Daddy is the buyer?

199
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,496
All of which is to say
the timing of this shower
is just...

200
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,540
It's not ideal.

201
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,416
Plus, I can't believe
Alice even wants to come,

202
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,501
from what you've told me.

203
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:44,585
She doesn't.

204
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:47,672
I was kind of hoping you might
talk some sense into her?

205
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,674
You know, like,
mother-to-mother?

206
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,175
Oh, yeah, no.

207
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,427
Please, Mom,
she really needs our help.

208
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:07,650
Fred.

209
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:11,654
You try to hire my crew on
the first day of construction?

210
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,447
Opportunity knocks
when it knocks.

211
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:14,699
Nothing personal.

212
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:16,117
Yeah, it never is
with you guys.

213
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,535
So what is it?
The development? What?

214
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,996
That land you're building on,
it belonged to my family.

215
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,623
We founded our
maple empire on it.

216
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:24,875
Now, we were in the process
of trying to reacquire it,

217
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:26,210
buy it back,

218
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:27,837
when your mysterious boss,

219
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,715
he, he just stole it right out
from underneath us.

220
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,800
And you can't go after him,
so you come after me.

221
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:36,637
The way your boss does
business deals, secret deals,

222
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:39,515
building that
SoDale monstrosity

223
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:40,933
at the speed of light

224
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:44,562
kinda makes me think that he
has a limited amount of funds.

225
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:46,897
So you're gonna
halt construction,

226
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:48,232
bleed him out.

227
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,234
Reacquire the land
at a more reasonable rate.

228
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,279
- That's a great plan.
- Thank you.

229
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,948
Except you're bleeding me out,
too, you pompous ass.

230
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:59,493
You're messing
with my business,

231
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:02,997
my livelihood,
my son's future.

232
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,958
I don't care if you're
the richest man in Riverdale.

233
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:08,711
I will come after you
with everything I've got.

234
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,171
Which is what, exactly?

235
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,426
Go park somewhere else.

236
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,895
How did it go with Clifford?

237
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,397
Good, insofar as I
didn't knock him on his ass,

238
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,441
which I would
really love to do.

239
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:35,321
He's in some kind of
grudge match with
the owner of this land.

240
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,989
Lucky us, we're caught
in the crossfire.

241
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:42,828
And this mysterious buyer...

242
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:44,997
Does Cliff know who he is?

243
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:47,041
No, he's as
in the dark as we are.

244
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,087
What the hell now?

245
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,971
What is this?

246
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,974
Your new crew,
reporting for duty.

247
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,186
I appreciate it, I do,
but isn't there
something more important

248
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:08,646
you need to be doing?

249
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,189
Like going to school,
playing football?

250
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:12,441
We can work after practice
and on weekends.

251
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,944
Until you find a new crew.
Help keep things on schedule.

252
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:18,572
Come on, Dad. I worked
for you the whole summer.

253
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:21,325
- And these guys...
- We're bruiser studs,
Mr. Andrews.

254
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:22,451
At least some of us are.

255
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,788
Come on.
Desperate times, Fred, huh?

256
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:30,876
All right. Here we go.

257
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:35,798
<i>♪ Life gives me
one more chance ♪</i>

258
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,134
You must be
loving this, Hermione.

259
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,428
Providing sanctuary
to my daughter.

260
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:44,306
Asking me here, to what?
Gloat?

261
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,602
Look, I asked you here
because I'm trying to help.

262
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,855
So what is your plan
for Polly?

263
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,274
What do you want?

264
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:54,984
I want my daughter back.

265
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,611
I want my family
back together.

266
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,322
Well, then,
it's time to face facts.

267
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,243
Hermione, Polly is a teenager.

268
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:06,746
She hasn't even
finished high school.

269
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:09,707
The father of her baby
has been murdered.

270
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:13,002
You want to play house
with her, and throw her
a baby shower, fine.

271
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,380
But the very next day,
all of those things
will still be true.

272
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,174
And she's supposed to what?

273
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,551
Raise a child?

274
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,553
Mothers do it every day.

275
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:24,722
We did it.

276
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,808
Come to the shower.

277
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:30,060
Be there for Polly. Help her.

278
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,815
Otherwise,
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

279
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,363
This is awesome.

280
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,741
Moving rocks beats working out
in our crappy weight room.

281
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,075
Hey, Keller!

282
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:47,495
Looking good, looking buff.

283
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,871
We should get you on the team.

284
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:52,541
I prefer my contact sports
one-on-one, you know, like...

285
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:53,959
Boxing.

286
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,341
Pretty handy with
that wheelbarrow, Archie.

287
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,176
You know, if the whole music
thing doesn't pan out,

288
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,762
you can always have
manual labor as a fallback.

289
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,431
Don't even joke.
I did this all summer long,
remember?

290
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,099
My dad loves
this kind of work.

291
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,643
And I love him, but...

292
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:11,811
No, I know.

293
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,604
Your dad's path
is not for you.

294
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:15,272
Trust me, I get it.

295
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,900
He works his ass off
for me, bro,

296
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,318
but never asks for anything.

297
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,695
Always has my back,
even when I mess up.

298
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,990
So if having his back means
I gotta haul some rocks,
then bring it on.

299
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:25,950
Agreed.

300
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,493
Your dad's got my back, too.

301
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:29,495
More than some people.

302
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,247
Exactly.

303
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,210
Hey, guys, you were
a life-saver today.

304
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,045
I appreciate it.
Hard hats go in the bin,

305
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:39,880
and there's sodas
in the fridge.

306
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,174
Crap! Hey, guys,
I forgot my phone.

307
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,811
Hey!

308
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,647
Hey, get away from there!

309
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,004
Moose, are you okay?

310
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,547
Stay down.
We'll get you some help.

311
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,757
- Who did this to you, Moose?
- No clue.

312
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:26,677
But they said,
as long as we keep working,

313
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,554
they're gonna keep
coming back.

314
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,117
What the hell happened?

315
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:54,872
Moose, over there, he caught
a couple of guys working over
my equipment with a crowbar

316
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,041
and then they got
the drop on him.

317
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:58,500
Who were they, vandals?

318
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,294
Cliff Blossom has made it
abundantly clear

319
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,587
he would love nothing more

320
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,172
than to see this whole project
go belly-up.

321
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,174
I doubt that Blossom's
gonna hire some thugs

322
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,593
to bust up your site
and beat up some teenagers.

323
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:10,054
Maybe it wasn't him.

324
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,723
I mean, this is
Serpent territory, right?

325
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:15,809
Maybe it was them.
Pissed that they had to leave
'cause of this project.

326
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,478
- Serpents?
- Yeah.

327
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:20,189
When I worked at the drive-in,
the Serpents never bugged me.

328
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,902
Did you see any snake tattoos,
anything on their jackets?

329
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,403
It happened pretty fast.

330
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,989
All right,
I'll talk to Blossom,
but I mean

331
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,367
I don't think we'll
get anywhere unless
we can ID these guys.

332
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:32,952
That is such bull.

333
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,162
If this was Clifford Blossom
asking for help,
you would say yes.

334
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:37,039
- Archie.
- What, Dad? It's true.

335
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,415
It's also not helping.

336
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:46,131
Have you heard from Mom?
Is she coming?

337
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,427
She's invited.

338
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:54,515
Hey, it doesn't matter.

339
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,602
If Mom doesn't want to come,
that's on her. It's her loss.

340
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:02,481
Betty, I've decided...
I want you to be
the baby's godmother.

341
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,150
Really? Me?

342
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,402
Oh, my God!

343
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,736
If anything would ever
happen to me,

344
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:10,614
the only person I'd trust to
take care of my baby is you.

345
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:13,867
Oh, my God, Pol!

346
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,333
It's so wrong, Val!

347
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,793
Things should not be this way.

348
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:25,546
It sucks, but, please, Archie,
talk to me.

349
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,007
I can't keep talking about it,
I have to do something.

350
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,217
Hopefully not something
you'll regret.

351
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,638
I'm sorry, Val, I have to go,
I have to try.

352
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,059
<i>Poor Moose.
Is he okay?</i>

353
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,854
His name is Moose. He's fine.

354
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:45,733
Dude, what the hell?
I've been texting you.

355
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:48,444
Archie, Jughead just told us
what happened yesterday.

356
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,363
Though I checked out
at the words
"construction" and "site."

357
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,408
Moose and I are going
to the Southside to find
those Serpents. You in?

358
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,661
Whoa! Hey, you didn't say
it was the Serpents
who beat Moose up.

359
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,455
'Cause we don't
know that for a fact.

360
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,874
Well, it's still worth a shot
if it might help my dad.

361
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,001
Kevin's boyfriend
can get us in.

362
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,377
Get you in where?

363
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,254
To some bar
where the Serpents hang out.

364
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,424
If Moose spots them,
we call Sheriff Keller

365
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:11,800
and get these goons arrested.

366
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,429
Archie, the Serpents
are dangerous.

367
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:16,889
They're drug-dealers.

368
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:17,931
What?

369
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:19,516
Says who?

370
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:21,852
Polly.

371
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:24,897
Remember? Trev told us
that Jason was dealing drugs?

372
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,565
It was for the Serpents.

373
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:28,692
You heard my Dad, Jughead.

374
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:31,195
Clifford Blossom is
trying to torpedo him.

375
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,614
Sheriff Keller basically blew
him off, right in front of us.

376
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,866
Somebody needs
to do something.

377
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:40,120
Archie, going into that bar
is a bad idea.

378
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:43,040
Jughead, are you coming
with me or not?

379
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:48,921
Thanks for having my back.

380
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,560
Play it cool,
just like we said.

381
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,562
Keep eye-contact to a minimum.

382
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,315
And Moose, if you see the guys
that jumped you, we leave,

383
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:09,983
and we call Kevin's dad.

384
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,126
Moose? Anything?

385
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,710
Not yet, not that I see.

386
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,295
We're all gonna die.

387
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,260
Pay up.

388
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,137
I'm gonna get
this back, right?

389
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,721
You wish, Preppy.

390
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,270
Is that one of them?

391
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,646
I can't tell.

392
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,314
He looks kind of familiar.

393
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:52,985
Oh, God!

394
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,236
Hey.

395
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,782
What? You got a death wish?

396
00:19:58,991 --> 00:19:59,950
Archie, back off.

397
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:00,993
What the hell is this?

398
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,578
You like beating up teenagers?

399
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,372
This isn't the first time
one of you Bulldogs
has come in here,

400
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,832
looking to 'cause trouble.

401
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:13,755
Hey! That's enough,
Mustang. Let 'em go.

402
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,181
I'll take care of this.

403
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,865
Not you, Red, you stay.

404
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,076
I'm good.

405
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,790
What the hell are
you doing here?

406
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,793
Looking for the thugs that
trashed my dad's equipment.

407
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,588
We figured it was
the Serpents, angry for
getting kicked off their land,

408
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:55,964
but now that I know
you're a Serpent,

409
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:57,758
I'm thinking this is personal.

410
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:00,052
Going after my dad,
his company,

411
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,803
that is payback, right?
For when he fired you?

412
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,097
Man, you've got a bigger
imagination than Jughead,

413
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,098
and that's saying something.

414
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,226
This isn't a joke.
My dad could lose everything.

415
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,977
You think I'm responsible?

416
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:12,105
That I've been, what, waiting
all these years for a chance
to get back at your old man?

417
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:15,609
No. No, kid, life's too short.

418
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,695
You don't know that now,
but you will.

419
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,369
I called him the second
you set foot in the bar.

420
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:29,831
Get in the truck, Archie.

421
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,794
<i>♪ Our house, our house</i>

422
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,379

00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,885
Hi, guys. Good to see you.
Right this way.

426
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,348
- Hey. Hey.
- Good to see you.

427
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,311
<i>♪ Our house, it has a crowd</i>

428
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,815
<i>♪ There's always

429
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,650
You're sweet to be here.

430
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,236
I know this isn't
exactly your scene.

431
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,447
What? Organizing
a baby shower?

432
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,241
It's totally on
my bucket list.

433
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:06,952
Mom!

434
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,455
<i>♪ Our house</i>

435
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,624

437
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,086
Polly, look, Mom's here!

438
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,804
I'm so glad you're here,
and you're safe.

439
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:30,475
You and the baby.

440
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,311
Oh, Mom.

441
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,316
We're here!

442
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:43,530
No big deal, it's only the
best stroller money can buy.

443
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,532
So expensive.

444
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:47,909
All I ask in return is
that you make me
your baby's godmother.

445
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:51,455
Kidding!

446
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:52,748
So not kidding.

447
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,710
Come on, Nana Rose,
let's get you a good spot
by the food.

448
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,047
Polly.

449
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:03,175
Let me begin with an apology.

450
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:06,178
When I first heard about
the baby, my initial instinct,

451
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:10,766
to embrace the baby
but not you was wrong.

452
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,061
I hope you can forgive me.

453
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,938
Think happy thoughts.

454
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,571
So what, you're a Serpent now?

455
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,073
Thought you left that behind.

456
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,908
A guy's got to make a living.

457
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,494
- And not many people
would hire me, after...
- Right.

458
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,120
It's my fault you run
with criminals

459
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,789
that rough up teenagers
and trash my equipment?

460
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,832
You really think
I'd come after you?

461
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,294
That I'd put you and your kid
in danger after everything
you've done for my boy?

462
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,089
Look, I'm

463
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,258
sorry for your troubles.

464
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,761
How bad is it?

465
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,555
I got no crew. I got no cash.

466
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,016
Never been worse.

467
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:55,268
Let me ask around.

468
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:58,438
See if any of my guys have
heard who it could be.

469
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,274
I'd appreciate it.

470
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:05,112
You'll pull through, Fred.
You always do.

471
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,572
But you might wanna keep tabs
on that boy of yours.

472
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:17,958
This necklace
reads the baby's aura.

473
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,793
Predicts the sex.

474
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,920
Nana has dementia
and gypsy blood.

475
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,173
- Oh!
- What?

476
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,508
Is my baby okay?

477
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,760
Babies.

478
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,388
It's twins.

479
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,306
One of each!

480
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:36,184
This is occultism
at its most ludicrous.

481
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,478
But I'm grateful to be here.

482
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:42,482
Oh! Thanks guys!

483
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,527
Okay, now Mom's.

484
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,082
It's my nightlight.
When I was a little kid.

485
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,960
How did you...
Where did you even...

486
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:05,505
I saved it. I know how much
you loved it and
how it made you feel safe.

487
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,008
And I wanted you to be able
to pass it down to your
own baby one day.

488
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:09,301
Alice, it's lovely.

489
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,473
Open ours next, dear.

490
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,441
You were protecting him.
That's why you didn't tell me.

491
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:25,525
Relax.

492
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:26,818
What happened?

493
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:29,571
Did you know that
Jughead's father is a Serpent?

494
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:31,490
No.

495
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,410
That's why he tried to stop me
from going to the bar,
so I wouldn't find out.

496
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,204
After everything
my dad has done for you...

497
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,706
Archie. I can explain, okay?

498
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:40,832
But not right now.

499
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,668
This is Polly's day, so you
two need to check yourselves.

500
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:44,794
I mean it.

501
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,463
- Archie...
- No, save it.

502
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:48,340
Come on.

503
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:52,761
That is
a family heirloom.

504
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:57,599
Great-grandfather Blossom
used to play with it.
Isn't it magnificent?

505
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,935
Oh, Polly, come stay with us
at Thornhill.

506
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:04,314
Cheryl's invitation
is genuine.

507
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:07,734
Thornhill's gates will
always be open to you.

508
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,861
The child would
want for nothing.

509
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,988
You would want for nothing.

510
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,036
Do you think that you can just
waltz in here, with a
bedbug-infested Trojan Horse,

511
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:21,081
wave a blank check around
and steal my daughter?

512
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:22,874
I didn't think you wanted her,

513
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:26,753
else why would she have
been exiled like some pariah?

514
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,005
To keep her away
from your family.

515
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:31,424
Oh...

516
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:34,135
And not because
you're ashamed?

517
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:37,931
Why is your own daughter
not living with you?

518
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:41,101
She's not going to
set foot in that twisted,

519
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:42,936
poisonous house of yours.

520
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,354
She should be so lucky.

521
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:46,356
Cheryl, that's not helping.

522
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:48,900
She'd do a lot better there
than with you.

523
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,193
How dare you?

524
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:52,737
Enough! Both of you!

525
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:53,989
If you believe one lie...

526
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:56,283
This is why
Jason is dead!

527
00:26:56,491 --> 00:27:00,120
Because of this hate.
This pointless,
stupid fighting.

528
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:01,746
- Honey...
- No, don't touch me.

529
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,748
We were supposed
to be together.

530
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,460
And you didn't let us
have that, neither of you.

531
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,589
And you know
it cost Jason his life.

532
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:12,549
Polly.

533
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,189
Mom.

534
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,026
You need to talk to her.

535
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:42,078
Polly, I'm sorry.

536
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,372
- It's just that woman...
- Didn't send me away.

537
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:47,167
You did.

538
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:53,214
And if you hadn't, I would've
met up with Jason,

539
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:55,050
and he still might be alive.

540
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,803
Or you might've gotten
hurt or worse.

541
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,389
I was alone there.

542
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,683
In that place.

543
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:08,021
I never wanted you to feel
alone, or unwanted,

544
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:09,731
or unloved.

545
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:14,944
Honey, come home.

546
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,656
I promise you you'll never
feel that way again.

547
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,910
You want me to come home?

548
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,870
More than anything, honey.

549
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:25,914
Yeah, but what about Dad?

550
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:27,999
Your father...

551
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,377
Dad's just gonna
have to get over it.

552
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:33,880
Are you sure he's not just
gonna try and make another
appointment for me?

553
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,508
What are you talking about?
What appointment?

554
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:41,054
Before you sent me away,
Dad made an appointment
for me to see a doctor.

555
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:45,016
Said he would be more
than happy to pay for it.

556
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,977
That I shouldn't have
to live with my mistake.

557
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:50,021
Oh, my God...

558
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:52,691
He didn't even ask me
what I wanted.

559
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,295
Dad, before you say anything,
I was trying to help.

560
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,589
- It was reckless.
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

561
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:18,591
I wanna pull my
weight around here.

562
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,760
I wanna help you
the way you help me.

563
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,554
We've both done
everything we can.

564
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,642
I need you to know, son...

565
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:32,647
I tried, my whole life,
to build stuff.

566
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:35,650
I tried to build a family,
that didn't work out.

567
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:41,197
I'm trying to build us
a safe life for you.

568
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:43,616
And the jury's
still out on that.

569
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,748
I've been pouring concrete
and laying brick

570
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,249
since I was your age.

571
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,587
That's who I am.

572
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:59,132
It's all I am.

573
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:04,387
Dad, I was thinking,

574
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,644
what if I have a kid someday,

575
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,856
and what if that kid
hates music,

576
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,232
doesn't want anything
to do with it,

577
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,444
and says, instead...

578
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:23,364
"Nah, I wanna build houses
and buildings like Grandpa."

579
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:26,075
I think that would be
pretty friggin' cool, Dad.

580
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:29,788
That would be something.

581
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:37,378
This is your legacy,
which makes it mine, too.

582
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,935
Polly's finally asleep.

583
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:55,688
What a mess.

584
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,237
I should've told you about
my dad when I had the chance.

585
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,115
So, why didn't you?

586
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:08,743
I was ashamed.

587
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:11,871
Jughead,

588
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,499
if we're gonna be together,

589
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,377
I want to know who you are.

590
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:19,379
All of it.

591
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:22,090
Okay.

592
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,009
Okay.

593
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:29,138
But Juggy, we should
talk to your dad.

594
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:34,143
He might know
something about Jason.

595
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,782
Jughead!

596
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:50,076
Dad, Betty Cooper.

597
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:51,578
Betty, this is my dad.

598
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,621
Hi, Mr. Jones,
nice to meet you, officially.

599
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,748
And you, and you. Um...

600
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,625
Why don't you guys sit down?

601
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:02,130
This isn't really
a social call.

602
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:05,800
No. I didn't expect
it would be after Archie
showed up at the bar.

603
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,011
We know the Serpents
had some kind of drug thing

604
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,596
going on with Jason Blossom.

605
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,180
What?

606
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:13,016
Where'd you hear that?

607
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:15,101
- Jason's girlfriend.
- My sister.

608
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:27,530
The kid needed some
money to get away.

609
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:31,242
A clean-cut kid like that,
no one's gonna suspect
him of running,

610
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:33,620
so we helped him,
he helped us.

611
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,538
Jeez, Dad.
Did you tell the cops that?

612
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:37,123
What do you think?

613
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,877
Well, they know now.
Polly told them.

614
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,463
So if they haven't been
by yet, they will be.

615
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:46,758
Did you ever talk to Jason?
Personally?

616
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,718
My guys gave him some product.

617
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:53,139
When it wasn't delivered,
we figured he'd took off
with our stash, until...

618
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:56,059
Until Jason's body was
found at Sweetwater River.

619
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:04,901
Anything else you wanna ask?

620
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:10,073
Did you have
anything to do with
Jason Blossom's death?

621
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:15,536
You really think
I could do that?

622
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,789
It's the dark ages, Dad.

623
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,500
I don't really know
what to think anymore.

624
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:24,462
I'm not a perfect father,
Jughead, no getting
around that,

625
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:28,424
but... I'm no killer.

626
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:45,483
- Do you believe him?
- I do.

627
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:49,696
Do you?

628
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,866
I believe you, Jughead.

629
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:21,853
Honey?

630
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:25,106
What did you say to Polly
when you found out that
she was pregnant?

631
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,066
Did you make an
appointment for her?

632
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:29,610
With a doctor?

633
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:32,655
That you offered to pay for?

634
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,574
Behind my back?

635
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:39,203
So that she could fix her...
Her mistake?

636
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:42,623
Alice.

637
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:44,042
Bastard!

638
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:54,343
So you did to Polly exactly
what you did to me?

639
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:59,640
See, this is why
I didn't involve you,
for this very reason.

640
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:01,434
I knew that you
would overreact.

641
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,980
Honey, you
weren't ready, okay?

642
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,523
And neither is Polly.

643
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:10,485
We were sending
her to the Sisters.

644
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:12,403
Why wasn't that enough?

645
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,782
Because of exactly
what is happening right now.

646
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:19,577
Our little girl's life
is being ruined

647
00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:21,621
by that mistake.

648
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:25,249
By that family.

649
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:29,253
Polly is moving home, into
this house, where she belongs.

650
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:30,797
The hell she is, Alice!

651
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:34,509
'Cause I will not be party

652
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,010
to raising a child

653
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:38,596
that has Blossom blood.

654
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:42,058
Get out.

655
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,184
No.

656
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:49,107
Get out!

657
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:50,525
Get out!

658
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:54,070
Get out before I do something
that we both regret.

659
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:59,200
And I think, by now, you know
what I'm capable of.

660
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:02,036
No. What would people think?

661
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:07,834
I don't...
I don't care anymore.

662
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:10,336
And I am not gonna ask again.

663
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:13,172
Get out.

664
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:17,969
I don't want you here
when Polly gets home.

665
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,380
I should've trusted you.

666
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,716
There's no excuse.

667
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:00,761
I was afraid that
the Serpents and my dad

668
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,805
were the ones doing
those messed up things.

669
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:06,225
I didn't wanna
believe that was true.

670
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:11,480
I mean...
He's my dad, Archie.

671
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:14,817
I get that. I do.

672
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,280
But, Jughead, you can talk
to me about anything.

673
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,115
You're like...

674
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,703
You're like my brother.

675
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,540
Nice bro-whisper, Archie.

676
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:32,877
You are my brother.

677
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:36,255
And I'm here for you
and your dad.

678
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:37,381
So what can I do?

679
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:40,718
Pray for a miracle.

680
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:48,351
The heat is on.
If the cops come around...

681
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,396
This is our insurance.

682
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:54,273
In case everything
goes to hell.

683
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:57,944
Here, stash it. Keep it safe.

684
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:02,990
How's it going
with the Keller kid?

685
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:05,409
It's good.
He thinks we're legit.

686
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:06,494
Right on.

687
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,704
We're gonna need that
inside line with the Sheriff.

688
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:13,709
What?

689
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,086
We got a problem?

690
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:18,172
He likes me, you know...
For real.

691
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,514
Ah, you're breaking my heart.

692
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:29,642
We all got a part to play.

693
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,270
Including me.

694
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,070
I've got calls into Greendale
and Centerville.

695
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:43,739
Clifford Blossom couldn't have
hired every crew in the state.

696
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,867
In the meantime, we'll
just be a two-person crew.

697
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:48,577
That won't be necessary.

698
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:51,580
You need a crew?

699
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:53,958
My guys are always
looking for work.

700
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:57,044
And you've never had
a better foreman than me.

701
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,008
I won't leave you
hanging this time.

702
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:04,677
What if there's trouble?

703
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,723
We can handle trouble.

704
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,352
We're burning daylight.

705
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:15,354
Let's get going.

706
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:18,107
I'll catch up.
We're just gonna
get the paperwork done.

707
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:25,072
I asked around about
those bruisers going
after your man's crew.

708
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:27,033
Turns out they weren't local.

709
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:30,286
Why are you telling me,
not Fred?

710
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,914
One of my guys says
he knows 'em from a stint
doing time up north,

711
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:35,416
in Montreal.

712
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:41,130
Pretty sure we both know
who has business in Montreal.

713
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,841
Hiram? But...

714
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,051
Why would he...

715
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:47,762
Maybe he got a whiff
of your little romance
with Freddy Andrews?

716
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:52,350
But the real question is,
who ratted you out?

717
00:39:57,772 --> 00:40:00,149
Mom had no idea, Polly.

718
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:02,777
Dad never told her.
She swears it.

719
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:05,696
I just...

720
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:07,615
I can't believe
she kicked him out.

721
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,241
She meant what she said.

722
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:15,331
She wants you and the baby,
or babies, to feel safe.

723
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,458
Which means...

724
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,294
You can come home now.

725
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:03,295
I'm sorry, Mom.

726
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,300
I tried.

727
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:32,741
Polly, we're so happy
you're here.

728
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:35,453
I'm doing this for my baby.

729
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,079
Of course.

730
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:38,414
You made the right choice.

731
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:40,166
You'll be safe here.
