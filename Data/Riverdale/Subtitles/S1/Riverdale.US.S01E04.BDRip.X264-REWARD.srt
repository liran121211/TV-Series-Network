00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:02,379
<i>Previously on</i> Riverdale...

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:05,507
<i>The story is about a town,
once wholesome and innocent,</i>

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:08,677
<i>now forever changed
by the mysterious death
of Jason Blossom</i>

4
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:09,970
<i>on the 4th of July.</i>

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,930
- Can we talk, Ms. Grundy?
- About what?

6
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:13,723
<i>You're the music teacher.
Can we talk about music?</i>

7
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:17,352
We heard what we heard,
and afterwards
we didn't do anything!

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,606
How would we explain why
we were together at 6:00 a.m.
on the 4th of July?

9
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,608
- Hello, Fred.
- Can I get you anything?

10
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:25,318
- A job.
<i>- I can't very well have</i>

11
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,070
the wife of Hiram Lodge,

12
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,697
<i>on trial for fraud
and embezzlement,</i>

13
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:29,990
<i>balancing my books.</i>

14
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:31,074
Oh, Hiram...

15
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:33,827
Oh, my God, it's Jason.
He was shot.

16
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:36,413
What were you doing
down at the river so early
on July 4th?

17
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:38,248
- Working on some songs.
<i>- Were you alone?</i>

18
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:40,083
<i>I saw something
at Sweetwater River.</i>

19
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,501
Ms. Grundy's car.

20
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,627
By the river's edge.

21
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:49,759
<i>It's been
a week since the discovery
of Jason Blossom's body.</i>

22
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:54,556
<i>But his death
is not the first,</i>

23
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,224
<i>nor would it be
the last casualty</i>

24
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:58,101
<i>that the town of
Riverdale would suffer.</i>

25
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:00,770
<i>The Twilight Drive-In
where I work,</i>

26
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,605
<i>my home away from home,</i>

27
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:05,442
<i>a piece of town history,
is closing for good,</i>

28
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:08,403
<i>just when we needed
a place to escape to the most.</i>

29
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:10,989
<i>With Sheriff Keller
knocking on every door</i>

30
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:13,116
<i>and neighbor
suspecting neighbor,</i>

31
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:15,577
<i>Riverdale, every day
that passes, is becoming</i>

32
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:18,038
<i>more like Salem
during the witch trials.</i>

33
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:20,623
<i>And meanwhile,
the girl next door,</i>

34
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:24,044
<i>our friendly neighborhood
Hitchcock blonde,
Betty Cooper,</i>

35
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:25,712
<i>was wrestling
with the knowledge</i>

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,630
<i>that her best friend,
Archie Andrews,</i>

37
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,966
<i>was caught up in
a forbidden romance.</i>

38
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:32,260
<i>"Dear Diary,</i>

39
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:34,763
<i>"Sheriff Keller doesn't
know what I know,</i>

40
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:37,974
<i>"that Riverdale High's
music teacher,
Geraldine Grundy,</i>

41
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:41,478
<i>"was at Sweetwater River
the morning
Jason Blossom went missing,</i>

42
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:44,272
<i>"and that since Archie
was also there,</i>

43
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:46,524
<i>"they could have
been there together."</i>

44
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,153
She is incredible.

45
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,198
She's the best.

46
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:07,712
I'm usually more
of a classic rock kind of guy,

47
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,756
but that was beautiful.

48
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,007
Truly.

49
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:13,093
Congratulations, Ms. Grundy.

50
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:15,220
Thank you,

51
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:16,930
both of you for coming.

52
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:18,807
No, you kidding?
Archie, he wouldn't miss it.

53
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,475
I had to beg him
to let me come.

54
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,852
Great. I'll see you
at school, Ms. Grundy.

55
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:23,770
Let's go, Dad.

56
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,563
Well, I was thinkin' that,
you know,

57
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:26,981
if you're gonna
be alone tonight,

58
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,817
that we could take you
out to dinner.

59
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:31,402
Oh. No, I...

60
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,446
No, I couldn't impose.

61
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:36,282
After everything
you've done for my son, I...

62
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,076
You know, with his music,

63
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,869
it's the least
I can do. I insist.

64
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,793
The Drive-In closing

65
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,546
is just one more
nail in the coffin
that is Riverdale...

66
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:50,880
No, forget Riverdale,

67
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,674
in the coffin of
the American dream.

68
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,509
As the godfather of
indie cinema,

69
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:56,010
Quentin Tarantino,
likes to say...

70
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,387
Please, God,

71
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,139
no more
Quentin Tarantino references.

72
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,016
What? I'm pissed.

73
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,561
And not just
about losing my job.

74
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:07,105
The Twilight Drive-In
should mean
something to us.

75
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:09,023
People should be
trying to save it.

76
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:12,193
In this age of Netflix
and VOD,

77
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:15,029
do people
really want to watch
a movie in a car?

78
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,073
I mean, who even goes there?

79
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:18,449
People who
want to buy crack.

80
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:20,201
And cinephiles,

81
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,661
and car enthusiasts.

82
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,829
Right, Bets?

83
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,290
Totally.

84
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,250
Anyway, it's closing

85
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,501
because the town owns it,

86
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,378
but didn't invest in it.

87
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:31,963
So when an anonymous buyer

88
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,048
made Mayor McCoy an offer,
she couldn't refuse...

89
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,842
Anonymous buyer?

90
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,677
What do they
have to hide?
No one cares.

91
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:38,636
I do!

92
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,848
Also, you guys should
all come to closing night.

93
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:42,974
I'm thinking

94
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:44,184
<i>American Graffiti...</i>

95
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:46,644
Or is that
too obvious?

96
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,855
I vote for anything
starring Audrey Hepburn.

97
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:49,898
Or Cate Blanchett.

98
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:52,192
Or <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley.</i>

99
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,360
Betty, your choices?

100
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:57,739
Everything okay, B?

101
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,909
Yeah, I'm just thinking. Um...

102
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:03,870
Maybe
<i>Rebel Without a Cause?</i>

103
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:07,832
Here you go, kids.

104
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,335
Thanks, Mom.

105
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,212
If I would have known
Mama Lodge was working

106
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,588
as a waitress at Pop's,

107
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,049
I never would have
given Veronica
a spot on the Vixens.

108
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,593
It's off-brand,
and sends a false message
about acceptance.

109
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,428
After her TMZ-style
take-down of Chuck,

110
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:22,180
all the Vixens kind of
like Veronica now.

111
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:23,306
Do they?

112
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,602
Be sure to put
all that cash
in the register.

113
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,604
You are a Lodge, after all,

114
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,273
and Lodges are known
to have sticky fingers.

115
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,943
- Cheryl...
- Honey, I got this.

116
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,861
Cheryl, I went to school
with your mother.

117
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,571
She didn't know the difference
between having money

118
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:40,114
and having class, either.

119
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,250
Now, that's an odd
combo of people.

120
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:56,631
- I'll be right back.
- No, Betty.

121
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,799
No. Don't...

122
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,259
Wait, what's happening?

123
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,931
Hey, Betty.

124
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,432
Hi, Mr. Andrews,

125
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,642
Ms. Grundy.

126
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,977
Archie, can I talk to you?

127
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,395
Sure. I'll call you later?

128
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:11,688
No. Actually, now.

129
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:13,606
Just school stuff. Outside?

130
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,824
Archie, as your best friend,

131
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,118
is there anything
you want to tell me?

132
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:27,120
I don't think so.

133
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,541
Ms. Grundy was at
Sweetwater River on July 4th.

134
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:35,545
Were you with her?

135
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:38,881
Did Jughead tell you?

136
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,676
Jughead knows about this?

137
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,637
What's happening out there?
Do we know? Is it about me?

138
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,015
I have a strong inkling,

139
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:48,474
and no.

140
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,018
Also, I'd let it go.

141
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,186
Yes, but you're you,
and I'm me.

142
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,272
You do you, girl,
I'll be back.

143
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:58,985
What was it like
before she got here?

144
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,947
I honestly cannot remember.

145
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,490
It's not what you're thinking.

146
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:05,658
So, it's platonic?

147
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:08,369
Okay, well, maybe
it's a little like

148
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:09,620
- what you're thinking...
- Archie.

149
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,915
Are you and Ms. Grundy,
like, together,

150
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:14,375
like, romantically?

151
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:15,668
Oh, my God.

152
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,003
You and your music teacher

153
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,046
are having an affair?

154
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,422
We are...

155
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,508
...together. Look,
I know that sounds bad, but...

156
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:23,718
Bad?

157
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,345
It sounds scandalous.

158
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,513
It sounds like
jail time to me. Illegal!

159
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,098
- Betty, don't go there.
- Oh, I'm already there.

160
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:30,350
Ronnie, a little help here?

161
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,392
I mean,

162
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:33,102
technically, Betty's right.

163
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:34,896
And ethically...

164
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,315
Well, what is Grundy
to you, anyway,

165
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,941
your girlfriend?

166
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,610
Your booty tutor?

167
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,070
I don't know,
I don't know
what to call her.

168
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:44,447
You said you were
at the river alone.

169
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,199
You lied to Sheriff Keller,

170
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:47,408
to all of us.

171
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:49,035
Why? To protect her?

172
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,828
She believed in me
when no one else did.

173
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,914
Okay, we get it.

174
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,333
Betty, say something, please.

175
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,384
Get in the car, Betty. Now.

176
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,521
- What have I told you
about those two?
- Can we just go?

177
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,906
Oh, Archiekins...

178
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:28,991
You're in it deep this time.

179
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,011
Turn down the music.

180
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:52,849
I spy with my little eye

181
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,684
Hermione Lodge,
full of secrets.

182
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,354
Riddle me this,
hair models
of the damned,

183
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,982
why is Veronica's mother
having a clandestine
tete-a-tete

184
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,442
with a Southside Serpent

185
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,110
behind a dumpster at Pop's?

186
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:08,114
Yeah, so we agree.

187
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:24,505
How hard would it
have been to give me
a little heads-up?

188
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:26,424
Look, I am, by nature,

189
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,259
a conscientious objector.

190
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:30,386
Not saying anything
to either you or Betty,

191
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,889
was the most moral, apathetic
choice I could make.

192
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:34,223
But, Jug.

193
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:35,600
She's not going to write
about me and Grundy

194
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:36,642
in the paper, is she?

195
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,144
Like she did with Chuck?

196
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:40,480
Dude, seriously?

197
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:42,607
Okay. Come on.

198
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,275
Think about
what you're asking.

199
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,778
If there was even
an iota of a chance

200
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:50,031
that something could
hurt you in any way,

201
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,407
Betty wouldn't do it.

202
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:53,951
- Probably.
- Oh, my God.

203
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,330
I'm kidding.
But maybe she has a point.

204
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,456
What do you see happening

205
00:08:58,664 --> 00:08:59,999
with Grundy, long-term?

206
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:02,376
What do you want?

207
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,713
I want
to be with her.

208
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:07,965
I don't know how,
but I wanna hang on to

209
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:09,717
what we have for
as long as possible.

210
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:12,011
Yup. I feel that.

211
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,472
Trying to hold on
to something a lot
older than me, too.

212
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,724
Just... If Betty's gonna
do anything crazy,

213
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:19,143
can you please
let me know so I can
do something to stop it?

214
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:21,020
Thank you for taking
the time, Ms. Grundy.

215
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:22,188
Like I said,
the <i>Blue and Gold</i>

216
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,315
is doing
a series of articles
spotlighting teachers,

217
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:25,650
and you're our first.

218
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,527
Let's begin.

219
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,779
Uh, you joined
the faculty last year.

220
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,489
Where did you move
to Riverdale from?

221
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,032
Um, here and there. I was

222
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:34,408
just mostly on the road.

223
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:37,453
- But you've taught at other
schools, I'm assuming?
- Oh, yeah. Of course.

224
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:38,579
- Yeah.
- Right.

225
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,414
Um...

226
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,124
Can I get their names?

227
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:45,002
Seaside High,

228
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,671
Centreville High.

229
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,755
What made you leave?

230
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,131
They were temporary
placements.

231
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,385
Just filling in for
maternity, sabbatical,
things like that.

232
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,221
This is my first
permanent position.

233
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,514
Getting back to music,

234
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:57,765
you're working
with Archie Andrews

235
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,058
on an independent study.

236
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:02,061
Have you ever done
this sort of thing before?

237
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,146
- Yes. Last year.
- Oh.

238
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:05,481
With Tomoko Yoshido

239
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:07,817
and Jason Blossom.

240
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,071
Jason?

241
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,657
- Before...
- Such a tragedy.

242
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,326
He was an inspiration.

243
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:19,662
And pretty cute, right?

244
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,542
I don't think of
my students that way.

245
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,544
- No, no, no, no...
- And I'm sorry,

246
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:27,670
I really should

247
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,714
prepare for
my next class.

248
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,304
It's this quintessential
rite of passage,

249
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,556
making out with your boy
or girlfriend at the movies.

250
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,308
Why don't we go together?

251
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:42,184
I can't promise you
any action,

252
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:44,353
but maybe I'll bring you
good luck.

253
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:45,771
Great. Another night,

254
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,148
another hag.

255
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,275
Speaking of hags...

256
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,401
Veronica,

257
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,736
it's so devastating to me

258
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:52,820
that your mother
has to sink to such

259
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:53,946
unspeakable lows

260
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:56,616
just to keep those knockoff
Hermes bags on your arm.

261
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:59,577
What's next, selling
her hair extensions?

262
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,830
My mom's a waitress,
Cheryl, not Fantine.

263
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,458
And your faux concern
reeks of ulterior motive.
What is it?

264
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,127
Only to remind you
of your place in this school,

265
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:10,212
nay, the town's
social hierarchy.

266
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,672
Threatened much?

267
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:13,924
Don't worry.
You may be a stock character

268
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,718
from a '90s teen movie,

269
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:17,303
but I'm not.

270
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,929
And what does
any of this have to do

271
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,264
with my mom
being a waitress?

272
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:21,766
It's just that
I saw her talking to

273
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,643
a Southside Serpent
last night,

274
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,186
in the alley behind Pop's.

275
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,814
They were having an extremely
heated, intimate discussion.

276
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:30,733
See for yourself.

277
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:38,407
Who or what is
a Southside Serpent?

278
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,159
They're this
gang of bikers

279
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:41,869
who pretty much stays
on the south side of town.

280
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:43,621
And thank God, 'cause
they're sort of dangerous.

281
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,748
Drug dealers
and petty thieves.

282
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,125
Then what was my mom
doing with one of them?

283
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:53,172
Ugh.

284
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,965
Who knew
working would be so...

285
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,133
Tiring.

286
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:57,718
- Mom.
- Hmm?

287
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,472
Cheryl showed me a picture.

288
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,350
You were standing
behind Pop's

289
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,644
with a Southside Serpent.

290
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:11,816
Those guys are thugs.
What were you doing?

291
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,944
First off, you have
nothing to worry about.

292
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:17,738
Come here, sit.

293
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,910
Now, remember Veronica,
I grew up here.

294
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:24,870
The Southside Serpents may be

295
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,122
from the wrong
side of the tracks,

296
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,832
but I went to high school
with some of them.

297
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,459
I was just being polite.

298
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,796
Cheryl said it looked
like you were arguing.

299
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:34,964
Arguing?

300
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,425
Hardly.

301
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,593
He made a lewd comment,
and I put him in his place.

302
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:42,221
- Mom, if you're in some
kind of trouble...
- I'm not.

303
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,266
<i>Mija.</i>

304
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,270
And when have
I ever lied to you?

305
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:56,235
I'm sorry,
but the Twilight Drive-In?

306
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:58,863
It's a blight
that's become a cesspool,

307
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:01,198
and a hangout
for criminals...

308
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:02,742
...and transients,

309
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,201
and the deal's done.

310
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,828
Andrews Construction
is scheduled

311
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,580
to demolish
the lot on Monday.

312
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,373
Mayor McCoy,

313
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:10,875
when I was a kid,

314
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:14,253
my family and I would go
to the drive-in all the time.

315
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,130
We couldn't afford
tickets for everyone,

316
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:19,175
so my sister
Jellybean and I would
hide in the trunk

317
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,927
until we parked.
We'd sneak out.

318
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,389
It's like my home.

319
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,102
That's a very sweet
sentiment, Mr. Jones.

320
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,023
But the future of
Riverdale is at stake.

321
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,235
Ms. Grundy showed up
in Riverdale a year ago,

322
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:39,403
out of thin air.

323
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,781
There's no record
of her before that.

324
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,908
Her Facebook,
her Linkedln account,

325
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,410
they were all created
one year ago.

326
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:47,620
Before that, she's a ghost.

327
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,330
She doesn't exist.

328
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,415
The only Geraldine Grundy
I could find was

329
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:53,375
a woman who died
seven years ago.

330
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,754
How... Where did you
find all this?

331
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:58,130
The deep web.

332
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,757
The dark internet.

333
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,468
Check it, it's all online.
Simple googling.

334
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,179
And did you cyber-stalk
Ms. Grundy before

335
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,263
or after you interviewed her

336
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:07,556
for a fake article?

337
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,476
Why are you doing this, Betty?

338
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,228
- I'm not in any danger.
- You don't know that.

339
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:13,729
Yeah, I do,
I'm with her.

340
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,689
I know
what we have,

341
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:17,233
and you don't.

342
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,652
She taught Jason Blossom.

343
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,488
- Did you know that?
- She's taught a lot of people,
Betty. What's your point?

344
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,781
My point is,

345
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,533
you don't know anything
about her, Archie.

346
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,743
- Doesn't that worry you?
- Betty, let this go.

347
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,870
- Archie, please...
- If you're really my friend,

348
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,163
you'll let this go.

349
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:33,457
Okay.

350
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:36,919
I'm sorry. I'm done.

351
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,505
I'll stop digging.

352
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:42,341
I know
it's not the drive-in,

353
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,593
but given our circumstances...

354
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:45,886
It's perfect.

355
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:49,348
Is everything okay?

356
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,686
We've always been
so focused on me,

357
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:56,522
my music, we never
get to talk about
you and your life.

358
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:00,901
- What do you wanna know?
- I dunno.

359
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,236
Stuff.

360
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,322
Anything. Have you always
wanted to be a teacher?

361
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,866
No.

362
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,075
No, I, um...

363
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:11,287
I graduated Juilliard,

364
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,163
and I auditioned
at Carnegie Hall,

365
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,624
Lincoln Center,
all the big symphonies,

366
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,001
but I didn't

367
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,211
make the cut.
Not even close.

368
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:21,630
I had a dream.

369
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,469
Sometimes that's all they are.

370
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:29,513
Just dreams.

371
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,516
And what about us?

372
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,311
Is this a dream?

373
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:36,937
Would that be so bad?

374
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:39,690
If it is...

375
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,402
It's a nice dream.

376
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,654
Where does
this end, Geraldine?

377
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,492
I have no idea.

378
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,786
But we're here.

379
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,456
And for me...

380
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,001
That's enough.

381
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,844
So much for
letting this go.

382
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,851
Are we really breaking
into Grundy's car right now?

383
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,771
How do you even know
how to do that?

384
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,231
My dad and I
fix cars together.

385
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,193
Thank God,
she drives an old...

386
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:37,081
Okay, before
going any further,

387
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:38,415
if I'm committing a felony,

388
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,459
I need to at least
ask the question.

389
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:43,087
Are you doing this
because you still have
feelings for Archie, or...

390
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,630
No, Veronica.

391
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,340
We're doing this because
Grundy has Archie

392
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,717
under some kind of
sexual spell,

393
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:50,302
and he won't listen to reason.

394
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,389
We're looking for anything
that proves Grundy isn't
as clean as she says she is.

395
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,271
Bobby pin.

396
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,440
Okay, Ms. Gyver.

397
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:14,201
I learned that
from the <i>Nancy Drew</i>

398
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,911
- detective handbook.
- Okay, go.

399
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,211
Oh, my God.

400
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:25,838
Oh, my God.

401
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,799
"Jennifer Gibson"?

402
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:30,592
Who the hell is
Jennifer Gibson?

403
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,555
That's not the only thing.

404
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,112
Oh, God.

405
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,200
Please don't tell me
you're still on
this crazy witch hunt.

406
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,995
It's not a witch hunt,
and it's not crazy.

407
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,291
- We were just in
Grundy's car...
- What?

408
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,168
- You were in her car?
- Yeah,

409
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,461
and thank God we were.

410
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,212
- We found a gun.
- What?

411
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:10,132
And an ID with
the name Jennifer Gibson.

412
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,302
This is proof
Ms. Grundy is not
who she says she is.

413
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,014
- Then who is she?
- Obviously some sketch-queen
named Jennifer Gibson.

414
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,766
Archie, what if
she had something to do

415
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,059
with Jason's murder?

416
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:22,728
She taught him,
she made you lie about him,

417
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,772
we know she was
at the river, she has a gun.

418
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,274
So does Dilton Doiley,
but you never thought
he killed Jason.

419
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:28,525
Open your eyes, Archie.

420
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,152
Jason was her
student last year.

421
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,280
Everything about her
is a huge, boldfaced
question mark.

422
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:35,157
Okay, whatever her name is,
she's not a killer.

423
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,867
You didn't ask her, did you?

424
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:38,035
About her name?

425
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,913
And why there's no record
of her before last year?

426
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,999
Why not?

427
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,471
Mayor McCoy says
you won the contract

428
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,098
to tear down the drive-in.

429
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:01,934
I did.

430
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,853
Look, I'm sorry, Jughead.

431
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:07,981
I know how much
you love the Twilight,
and so do I...

432
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,067
Mr. Andrews,
just give me one week

433
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,319
to track down
the person who bought
the land, and convince them

434
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:14,238
not to demolish
a holy house of cinema.

435
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,697
It's a big contract
for me, Jug,

436
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,407
and for my guys.

437
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,660
Whatever they build
in the place of the drive-in

438
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,121
- could mean more jobs...
- Yeah, in what?
Some hypothetical future?

439
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,833
You put one Jones out of work,

440
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,501
why don't you put out
another, huh?

441
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,878
Jug, your dad was
taking materials

442
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,171
from one of our job sites.

443
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,589
I had to let him go.

444
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:33,841
Right.

445
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:35,884
You did what you had to do,

446
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,636
like you're doing here now.

447
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,847
Later.

448
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,390
Jug.

449
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,686
You're late, Hermione.

450
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,688
I had to make a pit stop.

451
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,648
And as we discussed,
Madam Mayor...

452
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:52,234
A donation to your
re-election campaign.

453
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,205
And Lodge Industries
gets the Twilight Drive-In.

454
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:08,500
It's one of the most
prime pieces
of real estate in Riverdale.

455
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,924
No one can know
that I helped
goose this deal along.

456
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,885
Especially not the Blossoms.

457
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,219
Your secret will be
safe with me,

458
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,555
so long as you hold up
your end of the bargain.

459
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,566
Are you just
gonna stand there?

460
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,612
Archie...

461
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,992
Talk to me.
What is it?

462
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,744
Is your real name
Jennifer Gibson?

463
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,001
Who are you?

464
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,628
And what are you
really doing here?

465
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,087
- Archie...
- Why the new identity,

466
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,756
the moving place-to-place?

467
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,550
Tell me the truth, please.

468
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,225
I

469
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,478
was in a bad relationship.

470
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,106
A relationship...
I was married

471
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,234
to a man who would come home

472
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,778
from work every night, late,

473
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:20,197
and drunk, and with a temper.

474
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,740
One night, I ended up

475
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,075
in the emergency room

476
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:27,663
with broken ribs and
a shattered collarbone.

477
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,457
The next morning, he barely
even remembered the fight,

478
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,833
and he promised

479
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,543
that it wouldn't
happen again.

480
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:35,712
But...

481
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,547
It did,

482
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,258
again.

483
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:40,884
So...

484
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,095
I left.

485
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,514
And I

486
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,599
got a divorce,

487
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,102
changed my name...

488
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,437
Then I came here.

489
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,315
And I...

490
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,109
Well...

491
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:58,986
I met you.

492
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,850
Nice murder wall,
True Detective.

493
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,563
- Here's your High Point, Dad.
- Thanks, bud.

494
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:36,857
You need somethin'?

495
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,901
Can I borrow the truck
for the drive-in?

496
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,154
- You got a date?
- No, I'm going with Veronica.

497
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,780
Oh, okay.

498
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,991
I mean, is there not a
nice gay kid at your school?

499
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,784
Yeah. There is.

500
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,411
Me.

501
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,621
All right.

502
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,332
No cruising guys tonight.

503
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,875
Okay? We both know
what goes on
in those woods.

504
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,294
- Oh, my God, Dad...
- No, I'm dead serious.

505
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,171
All right, we've got
a murderer on the loose

506
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,089
and a lot of unsavory
characters in that
part of town.

507
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:02,632
So, if you go,
you stay in the truck.

508
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,509
- All right.
- Okay?

509
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:05,635
Together.

510
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,348
We're sorry to come
unannounced, Fred.

511
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,392
It's been a rough
couple of months for us,

512
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,436
- but Alice and I...
- We think that
Archie and Betty

513
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,021
should stop
spending time together.

514
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,773
Their relationship isn't good,

515
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,191
for either of them,

516
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,318
and their respective
behavior reflects that.

517
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:23,737
All right. So, if there
was anything that

518
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,322
you could do on your end...

519
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,740
My son's a good kid.

520
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,492
I live next door, Fred.

521
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,243
I see him
sneaking out at night,

522
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,537
slinking off into
the darkness at all hours.

523
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:34,498
Alice...

524
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,249
Are you spying on us?

525
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,377
Come on, Hal.

526
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:39,920
We said what
we came to say,

527
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,463
it's on him
if he ignores us.

528
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,384
Oh, my God.

529
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:47,511
Intense, right?

530
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,430
That's why she has
a fake identity
and keeps a gun.

531
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:53,016
It still doesn't make
what she did to you okay.

532
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:54,768
She didn't do anything.

533
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,853
Betty, you have to
accept that.

534
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,397
And I'm all
she has, right now.

535
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:00,482
You're in
over your head, Arch.

536
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,776
You're in this relationship

537
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,403
with this person
who is cutting you off

538
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,488
from everyone else
in your life.

539
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,532
Just think about
what you're doing, Archie.

540
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,368
Not only for your sake,
but Ms. Grundy's.

541
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,495
Is this really
what's best for her?

542
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,666
I am gonna
deal with this,

543
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:20,836
but on my terms,
not yours.

544
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:24,464
Good day, Ms. Hermione.

545
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:26,883
From the dry cleaners.

546
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:28,301
Ah, thank you, Smithers.

547
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,011
And Fred Andrews
is escorting me

548
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,180
to the drive-in, so
all the pieces are in place.

549
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,558
- The drive-in with
Fred Andrews?
- Yes.

550
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:35,892
An attractive woman going with

551
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,812
an old friend is
less conspicuous

552
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,023
than an old crone going alone.

553
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,818
You're not
an old crone,
Ms. Hermione.

554
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,238
Of course not.
That was a joke.

555
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:35,494
- Finally.
- What's wrong?

556
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,120
What's wrong is my daughter

557
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,080
is hiding a gun
in her bedroom,

558
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,624
and that's just for starters.

559
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:42,459
- I can explain...
- Oh, you will.

560
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,294
Now, get in the car.

561
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,579
Make some room, outcasts.

562
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,417
I'm having deja vu.

563
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:27,546
Yeah, senior year,
we're here, watching <i>Candyman.</i>

564
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,714
God, I hated that movie.

565
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,341
- You picked it.
- Mmm.

566
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,468
Did you think
I'd get scared,
and jump into your arms

567
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:35,262
like a damsel
in distress?

568
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,638
You did kiss me that night.

569
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,557
The briefest of flings.

570
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,475
You kissed me.

571
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:47,816
Is everything all right?

572
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,025
Yes.

573
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:51,486
I'm still hungry.
I'm gonna get
some popcorn.

574
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:52,571
- Oh, I'll come.
- No.

575
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,197
It's fine. I'm gonna
powder my nose.

576
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,323
Excuse me.

577
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:06,167
- Alice!
- I'm sorry to interrupt
your adultery, Fred,

578
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,210
but you need to
come with me.

579
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:08,336
Alice, what...

580
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,629
It's about the kids.

581
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,008
That hair.

582
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,134
That jacket.

583
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,345
Jason always
adored the drive-in.

584
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:25,228
Southside trash.

585
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,355
They've been doing that
since the opening credits.

586
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:29,941
Shh!

587
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,151
- Screw off!
- Nice haircut, you dweeb.

588
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,202
Hey! You know
what happens to a snake

589
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:42,954
when a Louis Vuitton
heel steps on it?

590
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:44,956
Shut the hell up,
or you'll find out!

591
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,713
Thank you.

592
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:57,218
I cannot believe you just
threatened a gang-banger.

593
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,220
I've dealt with worse
in the East Village.

594
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:02,015
I just hate when
people disrespect
my cinematic experience.

595
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,020
How about a refill?

596
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,189
Yeah, Kev,
how about a refill?

597
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:10,523
Cherry cola, as always.

598
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,422
Can I get a refill?

599
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,556
And some
gummy worms
and a cola.

600
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:49,688
And a hot dog?

601
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,523
Who am I trying to impress?

602
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,359
We're out of dogs.

603
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:56,903
Figures.

604
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,911
Not so tough without
your beard, huh?

605
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:12,293
Where's the rest of it?

606
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:13,336
The rest of it?

607
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:15,213
It was my understanding that

608
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,589
that was the agreed-upon
amount.

609
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:20,885
In that case,

610
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,930
maybe we need to have
a word with your husband.

611
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,141
Good luck with that.

612
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:30,520
As long as Hiram's in jail,
you'll be dealing with me.

613
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:32,272
Mmm-hmm.

614
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,274
- Is that a problem?
- Mmm.

615
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,529
Enjoy the movie, Hermione.

616
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:42,115
We'll be in touch.

617
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,127
No drive-in for you tonight?

618
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:55,837
I got you something.

619
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,172
Is this to make me feel better

620
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,132
about my tragic past?

621
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,300
No.

622
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:02,594
It's a...

623
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,053
It's a thank-you gift
for everything

624
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:05,054
you've done for me.

625
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:15,940
Archie...

626
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:18,568
This...

627
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:21,154
You cannot afford this.

628
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:22,530
I pawned one of my guitars.

629
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:24,532
Why?

630
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,368
You don't need to thank me.

631
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:28,536
You shouldn't...

632
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:30,789
...thank me.

633
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:35,835
Ms. Grundy,

634
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:38,630
I don't, I don't want to end
our lessons, but...

635
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,635
But that's what
you think we should do?

636
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,261
Don't you?

637
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:54,521
So, that bow
is a goodbye gift?

638
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,858
It's a
see-you-around-the-halls
gift.

639
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,194
A don't-forget-me gift.

640
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,322
That is hardly likely.

641
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,041
Well, well, well.

642
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,001
There they are.
What did I tell you?

643
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,837
Can someone tell me
what's going on here?

644
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,713
Of course. Archie,

645
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,006
would you like to
share with us

646
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:22,966
what you and Mrs. Robinson

647
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:24,926
have been doing
during your "music lesson"?

648
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:27,470
And please don't leave out
any of the lurid details,

649
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,598
because Betty here
keeps a very meticulous diary,

650
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,101
and I'm more than happy
to fill in the details.

651
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:45,780
Okay, okay.

652
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,490
This time I really need to go.

653
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,582
I'm Joaquin, by the way.

654
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:57,792
Give me your phone.

655
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:02,630
This is my number.

656
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:03,798
Use it.

657
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,467
Kevin Keller...

658
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:09,304
As in Sheriff Keller?

659
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,513
Is that a problem?

660
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:14,851
Is this a problem?

661
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,063
I won't tell
if you won't.

662
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:25,778
I never thought that
I would live to see the day.

663
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,573
I thought the one thing
that we could keep
our Riverdale safe from

664
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,158
was child predators.

665
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:32,410
Ms. Grundy's not a predator.
She's a good person.

666
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:33,745
Archie, you don't
have to defend me.

667
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:34,871
No, he doesn't.

668
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,164
Well,

669
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:37,665
they're not
denying it, are they?

670
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:39,083
They're clearly guilty.
I think the next step is

671
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,668
we take this
to Sheriff Keller,

672
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,795
and let the wheels
of justice take over.

673
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:43,880
Dad, you can't
let that happen.

674
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,633
- Son, it's complicated.
- She didn't force me
to do anything,

675
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:47,842
I went after her.

676
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:49,886
Everything that happened,
I wanted it to happen.

677
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,346
There's no surprise there.

678
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,056
Why are you
doing this, Mom?

679
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:54,766
Putting Ms. Grundy on trial?

680
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,267
This isn't just about her.

681
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,436
This is about him.

682
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,356
I want you see
what kind of person

683
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:02,815
Archie truly is.

684
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,359
Wait a minute, that is
what this is about?

685
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,945
Your crazy grudge
against my teenage son?

686
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:10,031
I'm never going to stop being
friends with Archie, Mom.

687
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,282
- Ever.
- We are done here.

688
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,201
- Oh, we are far
from being done here.
- Stop.

689
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,285
- Shut up.
- Stop!

690
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:15,578
Please.

691
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:18,665
You're right, Mrs. Cooper.

692
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:20,500
You're right. I'm selfish,

693
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,377
and I'm stupid, and
I don't deserve to be

694
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:23,920
your daughter's friend.

695
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:25,964
But please,
don't hurt Ms. Grundy

696
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,215
because you wanna hurt me.

697
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:31,094
This isn't about
hurting anyone, Archie.

698
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:33,721
It's about
doing what's right,

699
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,641
and, of course,
informing our neighbors.

700
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,267
Alice, I swear to God...

701
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:40,520
- You swear to God...
- Publish one word
about this, Mom,

702
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:43,606
and I will tell everyone that
I broke into Ms. Grundy's car.

703
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,441
- Betty...
- That I robbed her,

704
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,652
and made up
the story of their affair.

705
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,864
It will be like,
I finally...

706
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:53,616
Snapped.

707
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:55,618
Like Polly.

708
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:58,579
- Betty...
- It'll prove what everyone
already thinks about us.

709
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,498
"Crazy runs in that family."

710
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:03,668
Like mother, like daughter.

711
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,128
- You wouldn't dare.
- I'll quit.

712
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,341
I'll quit my job.
Will that satisfy you?

713
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,218
Yeah, it will. It has to.

714
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,971
And I absolutely
would dare, Mom.

715
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:19,767
She has to leave town.

716
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:21,477
- The hell she does.
- Son.

717
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:23,312
Why does she need
to leave town?

718
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,773
Because it's what's best.

719
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,900
And Alice will keep her word.

720
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:31,029
- I will.
- I'll pack up my things,
I'll be gone by morning.

721
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:32,613
Ms. Grundy.

722
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,304
How'd you like the movie?

723
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:58,931
Quite the twist ending.

724
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,116
Oh, my God.

725
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:39,138
- Veronica.
- What the hell was that?

726
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:42,767
I saw you with that biker guy,

727
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:44,685
that Serpent.

728
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:47,772
And don't tell me
you were just being polite.

729
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,525
I was handling some
unfinished business
for your father.

730
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,443
I'm gonna need
more than that, Mom.

731
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:54,987
Details,

732
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,114
specifics.

733
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,533
All right, then.

734
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:04,455
Your father hired
the Southside Serpents

735
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:07,583
to help decrease the value
of the drive-in's land

736
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,794
so he could purchase it
at a cheaper price

737
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,462
using an offshore LLC.

738
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,382
What you saw was
me paying them

739
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,424
for a job well done.

740
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:17,051
So...

741
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:19,804
Daddy's the anonymous buyer?

742
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:23,057
And he's doing this from jail?

743
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,018
He has an extremely
long reach, your father.

744
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:29,188
And he's sunk every last penny
that we have into this deal.

745
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:31,023
So...

746
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:32,984
Dad really is...

747
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:35,319
Dad is a businessman.

748
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,240
He saw an opportunity,
and he took it.

749
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:41,200
And it was happening anyway.

750
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,744
Old Riverdale's dying.

751
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:46,372
He's just simply
helping it along.

752
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:48,166
- But it's wrong.
- Wrong?

753
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:51,711
Well, did you like
living at the Dakota

754
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:52,879
with a Central Park view?

755
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:56,340
Did you like
your personal shopping
account at Barneys?

756
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:59,343
How about our family dinners
at Jean Georges?

757
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:00,720
Your Hermes?

758
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:04,599
- Those were
just things, Mom...
- That was our life, Ronnie,

759
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,726
provided to us
by your father.

760
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:10,980
Understand?

761
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:32,835
You are not

762
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,338
those things you said.

763
00:37:37,215 --> 00:37:38,257
You're not stupid.

764
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:42,929
This wasn't your fault.

765
00:37:58,069 --> 00:37:59,028
<i>Betty.</i>

766
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:04,116
Polly kept so,
so many secrets from us.

767
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:12,917
I won't have any more
secrets between us.

768
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,797
Not anymore.

769
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,757
Not if I'm gonna
keep you safe.

770
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,011
What's my name, Mom?

771
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,889
Say it.

772
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,977
- Elizabeth Cooper.
- That's right.

773
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:34,438
I am Elizabeth,
I am not Polly.

774
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:35,940
Archie is not Jason.

775
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,400
So stop using them

776
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:39,777
as an excuse
to control my life!

777
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,106
"<i>Dear Diary, love
makes you do crazy things,</i>

778
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:02,443
<i>"and maybe some of what I did
was wrong, but maybe...</i>

779
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:07,239
<i>"Maybe I was right
about some things, too.</i>

780
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:12,161
<i>"Maybe Ms. Grundy
was dangerous in some way.</i>

781
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,918
<i>"Tomorrow morning,
when we wake up,</i>

782
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:21,670
<i>"the world will,
yet again, be changed."</i>

783
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:17,852
They'll tear
that booth down, too.

784
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,396
Raze the whole place.
Send it to the junkyard.

785
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:22,314
And us with it.

786
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:23,774
Yeah...

787
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,276
Maybe they'll save it.

788
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:27,319
All the pieces.

789
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:29,113
Store it in
the town hall attic,

790
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,115
and rebuild it
in a hundred years.

791
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:32,741
Wonder who the hell we were.

792
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:35,453
Hmm.

793
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:38,873
So where are you
gonna live now?

794
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:41,959
I'll figure it out, Dad.

795
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:46,172
I always do.
