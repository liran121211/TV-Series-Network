1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,736
Our story is about a town, a small town,

2
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:08,595
and the people who live in the town.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,474
From a distance, it presents itself

4
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:14,844
like so many other small
towns all over the world...

5
00:00:14,846 --> 00:00:16,046
Safe.

6
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:17,180
Decent.

7
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:18,682
Innocent.

8
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:20,884
Get closer, though,

9
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:24,054
and you start seeing
the shadows underneath.

10
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:28,058
The name of our town is Riverdale.

11
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:40,670
And our story begins, I guess,

12
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:43,206
with what the Blossom
twins did this summer.

13
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:51,805
On the Fourth of July, just after dawn,

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,417
Jason and Cheryl Blossom
drove out to Sweetwater River

15
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:56,786
for an early morning boat ride.

16
00:00:57,226 --> 00:00:58,625
Are you scared, Jason?

17
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:11,468
The next thing we know happened for sure

18
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,802
is that Dilton Doiley,

19
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:14,637
who was leading
Riverdale's Boy Scout Troop

20
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:16,573
on a bird watching expedition,

21
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:19,509
came upon Cheryl by the river's edge.

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,829
Jason...

23
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:36,126
Riverdale Police dragged
Sweetwater River for Jason's body,

24
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:37,927
but never found it.

25
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:39,529
If he is dead, Hal,

26
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:43,032
I hope in those last
moments he suffered.

27
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:47,837
May Jason Blossom burn in hell.

28
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:50,880
So a week later,

29
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:54,844
the Blossom family
buried an empty casket

30
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:57,947
and Jason's death was ruled an accident,

31
00:01:57,972 --> 00:02:00,682
as the story that Cheryl
told made the rounds.

32
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:04,387
That Cheryl dropped
a glove in the water,

33
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:07,056
and Jason reached down to get it,

34
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:09,058
and accidentally tipped the boat,

35
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,461
and panicked, and drowned.

36
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:16,432
As for us, we were still talking
about the "July Fourth tragedy"

37
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:18,334
on the last day of summer vacation,

38
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:21,471
when a new mystery rolled into town.

39
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:31,047
Now brace yourself. The
apartment's small, a pied-a-terre,

40
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:34,384
- but "quality, always."
- "Quality, always."

41
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:37,120
Plus, it's the only piece
of property in my name

42
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:38,421
and not your father's.

43
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:45,061
Ms. Hermione!

44
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:46,729
- Welcome home!
- Smithers!

45
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,832
Oh, you are a sight for sore eyes.

46
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:51,768
- How was the ride?
- No traffic, thank God.

47
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,670
Smithers, I'd like to introduce you

48
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:55,505
to my daughter, Veronica.

49
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:58,141
- It's a pleasure, miss.
- Hi.

50
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:00,210
- I'll get the bags.
- Would you?

51
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:02,412
Oh, and would you like some
menus, ma'am, so you can order in?

52
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:04,147
Oh, no. I have been craving

53
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:06,149
one of Pop Tate's
cheeseburgers since noon.

54
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:07,717
Is his Chock'lit Shoppe still open?

55
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:11,512
What is a Chock'lit Shoppe
and why does it sell burgers?

56
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:25,922
Are you excited? Nervous?

57
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:30,340
Both. I haven't seen him all summer.

58
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:32,408
Which is why nerves are acceptable,

59
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,677
but we agreed, Betty... It's time.

60
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,447
You like him, he likes you.

61
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,515
Well, then why, Kevin,

62
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:41,351
hasn't he ever said or done anything?

63
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:44,220
Because Archie's swell,

64
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:46,189
but like most millennial straight guys,

65
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:47,490
he needs to be told what he wants.

66
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:49,459
So tell him, finally.

67
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:51,127
Well, we'll see. I mean, it depends.

68
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:53,162
Oh, my God!

69
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:54,664
What?

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,597
Game-changer. Archie got hot!

71
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:01,064
He's got abs now.

72
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,576
Six more reasons for you to take
that ginger bull by the horns tonight.

73
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:08,772
So, what was the highlight?

74
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:10,346
Of my internship?

75
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:13,883
The Toni Morrison book release
party I organized, by far.

76
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:15,385
At the end of the night, Toni Morrison,

77
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:16,920
who is, as you know,

78
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:19,622
- my literary hero, says to me...
- Yes. Yes.

79
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:21,724
"Don't rush this time, Betty.

80
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:24,627
"It goes by so fast at your age.

81
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:26,896
"One summer can change everything."

82
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,301
Wow. That's so true.

83
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:32,568
How was working for your dad?

84
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,405
It was... Pouring concrete,

85
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,340
every day, all day long.

86
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,544
To pass time, I would start composing

87
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:43,079
these poems, in my head.

88
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:44,514
And at night, I'd go home,
I'd write them down...

89
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:46,015
You don't even like reading poetry.

90
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:49,585
They weren't poems,
they were song lyrics.

91
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,434
And working on them made me feel like...

92
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,092
What, Archie?

93
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:57,694
It made me feel like

94
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:59,729
I'd finally broken
through to something real.

95
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:01,731
About my life

96
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:03,373
and what I should be
trying to do with it.

97
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:05,468
Music.

98
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:08,104
Starting this year, tomorrow.

99
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:09,605
Amazing.

100
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:12,642
Will you ask Ms. Grundy to tutor you?

101
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,777
- I'm not sure, maybe.
- What about football?

102
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,612
- Can you do both?
- I'll try out, at least.

103
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:18,915
- Well, have you told your dad?
- No.

104
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,216
Until I've got things more figured out,

105
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:21,818
you're the only person
I'm telling, okay?

106
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:25,922
Well, I'd love to hear them sometime.

107
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:27,156
Your songs.

108
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:28,424
- Yeah?
- Yes.

109
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:30,126
Yeah, I'm finishing a
couple of demos tonight.

110
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:33,563
Great. Also...

111
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:35,665
I've been thinking

112
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,967
about us, Archie,

113
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:41,804
and our friendship,
and how it's time we...

114
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:58,821
I called in an order, for Lodge?

115
00:05:58,823 --> 00:06:00,423
Two burgers, yeah, almost ready,

116
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:02,158
but you gotta wait.

117
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:04,660
- Hi.
- Hey.

118
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:07,217
How are the onion rings here?

119
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,664
So good.

120
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:10,608
Can we get some onion
rings, too, please?

121
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:11,832
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

122
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,270
My mom and I just moved here, so...

123
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:15,972
- From where?
- New York.

124
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:17,273
Wow.

125
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:20,176
Do you guys go to Riverdale?

126
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:22,311
- We do. Both of us. Together.
- We're sophomores.

127
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:23,780
Me too.

128
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:26,482
- I'm filled with dread.
- Why is that?

129
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:29,619
Are you familiar with the
works of Truman Capote?

130
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:31,988
I'm Breakfast at Tiffany's,

131
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,990
but this place is
strictly In Cold Blood.

132
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:38,294
Veronica Lodge.

133
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,695
Archie Andrews.

134
00:06:41,054 --> 00:06:42,353
Uh, this is Betty Cooper.

135
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:45,001
Wait, are you...

136
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:47,972
Supposed to give you
your tour tomorrow? Yes.

137
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:50,440
I'm your peer mentor.

138
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:51,607
Do you want to join us?

139
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:54,077
Hey, maybe we can
un-fill you with dread.

140
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:55,745
My mom's waiting for me.

141
00:06:56,314 --> 00:06:58,281
But, to be continued.

142
00:06:58,283 --> 00:06:59,449
Yeah.

143
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,354
- What were you saying?
- Nothing.

144
00:07:07,892 --> 00:07:11,127
Hey, Dad. First day of
school and I'm already late.

145
00:07:11,152 --> 00:07:13,266
Hey, Vegas.

146
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,782
Hey, you, uh, you
stopping by the site later?

147
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:18,434
Dad, it's my first day.

148
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,236
Oh, we got to get you
going in the office,

149
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:22,071
so next summer you're not on the crew.

150
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:25,260
Well, I can't. I've
got football tryouts.

151
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:28,277
Or is that not okay?

152
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:31,948
No, it's, uh... It's okay. Good luck.

153
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:35,751
Hmm.

154
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:40,523
Betty. This coming year
is critical for colleges.

155
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:42,024
Grades are important,

156
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:43,960
extracurriculars, athletics.

157
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:46,062
Maintaining a decent character

158
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:48,731
is hugely important,
they do look at that.

159
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,166
Mom, I'm a sophomore.

160
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,168
You've accomplished so much,

161
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,670
I don't want anything jeopardizing that.

162
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:58,503
I mean, just think of your poor sister.

163
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,409
She was such a shining star

164
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,078
before she let that
Blossom boy ruin her.

165
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,579
Mom, I'm not Polly.

166
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:05,648
You missed curfew last night.

167
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,350
By seven minutes.

168
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:09,652
I was with Archie,
who has red hair, yes,

169
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:12,188
but is nothing like Jason Blossom.

170
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:15,458
Oh, but sweetie, all boys
are like Jason Blossom.

171
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:19,028
I love you so much, Elizabeth.

172
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:23,200
I just need you to be smart, okay?

173
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,220
And stay...

174
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,304
Focused.

175
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:31,244
I refilled your Adderall.

176
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:34,714
Seems you forgot to pick
up your prescription.

177
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:51,460
Bro, you are ready for football.

178
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:52,995
I'm not kidding you,
dude. You got ripped.

179
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:54,830
Dude, you're a beast. Look
at this arm, it's diesel!

180
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,866
How much are you
benching, like 220? 225?

181
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:58,267
You got to give me some tips, man.

182
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:01,037
Romanian deadlifts,
right? Taking some T?

183
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,939
Ginseng?

184
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:04,874
Maca root?

185
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,042
Tribulus terrestris?

186
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,577
It's from working construction, Reg.

187
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:09,579
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. Yo, Moose.

188
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:11,681
- Look who grew up over the summer.
- Hey!

189
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:13,049
Yo, be honest with me.

190
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,551
You work on any houses?
Any private homes?

191
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:16,586
Yeah, a couple.

192
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:19,655
Did you tap some cougar ass this summer?

193
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,424
You know what, I think
that's more a fantasy

194
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,292
from your wank-bank, Reggie.

195
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:25,528
- I'll catch you guys soon.
- Peace out, brother.

196
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,563
- Totally did it, bro.
- He totally did it.

197
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,366
So, I usually start off my tours

198
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:33,002
with a little history and context.

199
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:35,905
Riverdale High first opened
its doors in 1941 and...

200
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:38,507
And hasn't been redecorated
since, apparently.

201
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:40,576
Honestly, I feel like I'm wandering

202
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:42,941
through the lost epilogue of Our Town.

203
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:44,814
Uh-huh.

204
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:47,183
So what's the social scene
like here? Any night clubs?

205
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,151
A strip club called the Ho Zone

206
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:51,554
and a tragic gay bar called Innuendo.

207
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:52,755
Friday nights, football games

208
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:54,877
and then tailgate parties
at the Mallmart parking lot.

209
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:56,726
Saturday night is movie night,

210
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:57,793
regardless of what's
playing at the Bijou,

211
00:09:57,795 --> 00:09:59,061
and you better get there early,

212
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:00,730
because we don't have
reserved seating in Riverdale.

213
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:04,000
And Sunday nights... Thank God for HBO.

214
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:06,569
Veronica Lodge, Kevin Keller.

215
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,971
- Veronica's new here. Kevin is...
- ...gay, thank God.

216
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,273
Let's be best friends.

217
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:11,941
Is it true what they say about your dad?

218
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,106
That he's the devil incarnate?

219
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:18,501
I stand by my father.

220
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:20,950
Does everyone here know?

221
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,255
Wonderful. Ten minutes
in and I'm already

222
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:27,957
the Blue Jasmine of Riverdale High.

223
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:29,963
What?

224
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:51,466
Mm-mm.

225
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:54,731
Excuse me, this is a closed rehearsal.

226
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:56,589
I'm sorry, I...

227
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,656
Josie, right?

228
00:10:59,322 --> 00:11:00,823
I was hoping I could talk to you

229
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:02,085
about some songs that I wrote?

230
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,572
Let me just stop you right there.

231
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:06,829
You're staring at our pussycat ears,

232
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:08,197
which is rude,

233
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:11,400
but let me break it,
and them, down for you.

234
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:13,903
The Pussycats are building a brand,

235
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:18,140
creating a signature look,
okay? We're telling a story.

236
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:21,410
Last year, we won Rockland
County's Battle of the Bands.

237
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:22,578
That we did.

238
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,015
This year, we'd like to
build on that success,

239
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:28,884
continue telling our story

240
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:30,986
with songs we write.

241
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:33,289
I get that. It's just...

242
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,925
Read my glossed lips,

243
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:37,493
Justin Gingerlake.

244
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:39,572
Not...

245
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:41,097
Gonna...

246
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:42,631
Happen.

247
00:11:44,544 --> 00:11:46,535
Oh, and of course
there's the Back-to-School

248
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:48,738
- semiformal dance this weekend.
- Oh!

249
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,420
There's the hottie we
were with last night.

250
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:52,871
The red-headed Ansel Elgort.

251
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,543
Is he your boyfriend?

252
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:56,412
- No, he's straight.
- No, we're just friends.

253
00:11:57,548 --> 00:11:59,749
In that case, mind putting in a word?

254
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:02,184
I've tried every flavor
of boy but orange.

255
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:03,986
Actually, to clarify...

256
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:05,821
Betty and Archie aren't dating,

257
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:07,456
but they are endgame.

258
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,400
You should ask him to
the semiformal then.

259
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:12,957
She should, but I heard it
might be getting canceled.

260
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,769
Because of what happened to Jason.

261
00:12:14,794 --> 00:12:16,565
They're gonna tell us at the assembly.

262
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,634
Who's Jason and what happened to him?

263
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:21,771
Thank you for that moment of silence.

264
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,372
Many of you were lucky enough

265
00:12:23,374 --> 00:12:25,474
to have known my brother personally.

266
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:29,431
Each and every one of you
meant the world to Jason.

267
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:31,614
I loved my brother.

268
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:34,650
He was and always will be my soulmate.

269
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:36,685
So I speak with the confidence

270
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:38,480
only a twin could have...

271
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:42,091
Jason wouldn't want us to
spend the year mourning.

272
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:46,724
Jason would want us to
move on with our lives.

273
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:48,431
Which is why I've asked the School Board

274
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,566
not to cancel the
Back-to-School semiformal.

275
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:53,305
But rather, to let us use it

276
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,172
as a way to heal, collectively,

277
00:12:56,174 --> 00:13:00,109
and celebrate my brother's too,
too short life on this mortal coil.

278
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:02,511
Thank you all.

279
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,128
- Ms. Grundy? Hey.
- Archie.

280
00:13:11,715 --> 00:13:14,133
What are you doing walking in this heat?

281
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:15,658
Um... Building character?

282
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:19,395
Do you want a ride?

283
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:42,077

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

284
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,678
Ms. Grundy. Ms. Grundy.

285
00:13:51,648 --> 00:13:52,948
Geraldine.

286
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,952
What can I do for you, Mr. Andrews?

287
00:13:57,888 --> 00:14:00,278
Can we talk, Ms. Grundy, please?

288
00:14:00,303 --> 00:14:03,348
It depends. About what?

289
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:06,261
Music.

290
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,473
You're the music teacher.
Can we talk about music?

291
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:09,965
Of course.

292
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:12,661
Make an appointment.

293
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:15,505
During my office hours,
my official office hours.

294
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,380
Hermione Lodge.

295
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:30,285
Well, my day just got
a lot more interesting.

296
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,064
Hello, Fred.

297
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:33,421
How are you?

298
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:34,990
Surprised.

299
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,037
Can I get you anything?
Would you like a water?

300
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:40,462
A job.

301
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:42,330
I saw on your website

302
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:45,367
that you are looking
for a seasonal hire,

303
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:46,735
someone to help with the books?

304
00:14:46,737 --> 00:14:49,604
Yeah, my guy's on paternity leave.

305
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,040
You know, I think my
daughter's going to school

306
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:55,341
with your son, isn't that funny?

307
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:57,893
We'll have to tell them
that we knew each other,

308
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:59,748
that we even dated,
for a little while...

309
00:15:00,851 --> 00:15:03,151
- Well, at least until I...
- ...chose the rich kid.

310
00:15:03,832 --> 00:15:05,886
And now, a reversal of fortune.

311
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,068
How's Mary doing?

312
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:11,993
She's in Chicago.

313
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,262
We split up. We're civil.

314
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:15,563
How about you?

315
00:15:16,237 --> 00:15:18,604
How are you holding up? Really?

316
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:21,997
I have a little money saved.

317
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:26,341
I was praying that someone in Riverdale,

318
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:29,177
maybe an old friend,

319
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,857
would be willing to give
me the benefit of the doubt.

320
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:33,648
If it were up to me.

321
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,580
Isn't it up to you? It's your company.

322
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:40,073
Well, I have clients.

323
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:41,990
I can't very well have Hermione Lodge,

324
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:43,491
the wife of Hiram Lodge,

325
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:45,427
on trial for fraud and embezzlement,

326
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:47,572
balancing my books.

327
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:49,164
Can I?

328
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:50,909
No.

329
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:54,537
I suppose you can't.

330
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:16,391
Can I join?

331
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,393
Yeah.

332
00:16:18,418 --> 00:16:20,128
What are we doing?

333
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,830
Listening to one of Archie's songs.

334
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:23,531
I thought we were
going to have to pretend

335
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:26,234
to like it, but it's
actually really good.

336
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,370
Wait, that was you singing?

337
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:30,505
- Something you wrote?
- It's rough.

338
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:31,773
No, it's great.

339
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:34,576
It's incredible, actually,
the little snippet I heard.

340
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,878
Is that your thing? Music?

341
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,057
Are you doing something with that?

342
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,615
Yeah, that's the plan.

343
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,851
So how's your first day going? Good?

344
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,819
Not to be a complete narcissist,

345
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:46,421
but I thought people would be more...

346
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,123
Obsessed with you?

347
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:50,325
Any other year, you'd be
trending number one, for sure.

348
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:52,227
This year, though, it's all about Cheryl

349
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:54,195
trying to win the Best
Supporting Psycho Oscar

350
00:16:54,197 --> 00:16:57,332
for her role as Riverdale
High's bereaved Red Widow.

351
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:59,267
Hey, I should go. I got
that meeting with Grundy

352
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,469
and then football tryouts, so.

353
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:03,371
You play football,
too? What don't you do?

354
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:06,408
Before you ask, Blue Jasmine, no,

355
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,909
she has not invited
him to the dance yet...

356
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:09,477
Not yet, and don't talk about Archie.

357
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:12,614
Veronica Lodge, I'd heard whisperings.

358
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,649
I'm Cheryl Blossom, may I sit?

359
00:17:14,674 --> 00:17:16,284
Betty, would you mind?

360
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:22,700
So, what are you three
hens gossiping about?

361
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,860
Archie's Efron-esque emergence
from the chrysalis of puberty?

362
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:29,297
Extracurriculars.

363
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,510
Weatherbee wants me
to sign up for a few.

364
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:33,568
Cheerleading. You must.

365
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,603
I'm senior captain of the River Vixens.

366
00:17:35,628 --> 00:17:37,473
Is cheerleading still a thing?

367
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:39,921
Is being the Gay Best
Friend still a thing?

368
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:45,079
Some people say it's retro,
I say it's eternal and iconic.

369
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:47,682
At Spence, I sat at the
top of the Elites' pyramid.

370
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:49,173
I'm in.

371
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:50,753
Betty, you're trying out, too.

372
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:54,022
Of course, anyone's welcome to try out,

373
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:55,757
but Betty's already got so much

374
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,192
on her plate right now

375
00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:59,427
and being a Vixen is
kind of a full-time thing.

376
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:01,529
But open to all!

377
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,470
Follow me on Twitter
and I'll do the same.

378
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:07,239
My handle is @cherylbombshell.

379
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:11,606
Okay. Go ahead and hate on cheerleading,

380
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:12,974
but if Hipster Prince Harry...

381
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:15,743
I'd love to be a cheerleader.

382
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:18,179
It would look great on
my college applications.

383
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,415
But last year, when I tried out,

384
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:22,016
Cheryl said I was too fat.

385
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,585
"Too season 5 Betty Draper."

386
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:25,119
It was a great line,

387
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:27,233
but not at all true.

388
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:30,391
Well, you're a total smoke show now.

389
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:31,526
I mean it.

390
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,729
As hot and as smart as you are,

391
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:37,704
you should be the Queen
Bey of this drab hive.

392
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:41,002
Look, if you want to be a River Vixen,

393
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:43,137
I'll help you prep. I have moves.

394
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:48,813
Okay. You know what? Show me your moves.

395
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:00,315
They're...

396
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:02,642
Very real,

397
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:05,171
very personal.

398
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:07,158
I took your advice and wrote them down.

399
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:09,116
Polished them.

400
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:11,305
But I was wondering maybe
if you could help me...

401
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,587
With what, Archie?

402
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:15,436
You went to Juilliard, Ms. Grundy.

403
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:17,338
There is no one else in
Riverdale I can take lessons from.

404
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,907
Believe me, I've looked.

405
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,509
Well, I don't think that's a good idea.

406
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:26,112
I don't think we should
be alone together.

407
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,620
If this is you trying
to restart something

408
00:19:32,622 --> 00:19:35,089
that never should've
started in the first...

409
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,192
No, it's not. It is about the music.

410
00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:42,697
But it's also...

411
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:46,868
Come on, I need to be able

412
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,503
to talk about what
happened with someone.

413
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:50,271
We heard what we heard

414
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,006
and afterwards, we didn't do anything.

415
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:53,745
We didn't say anything.

416
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,835
We heard fireworks.

417
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,634
Who's lighting fireworks
at 6:00 in the morning?

418
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:09,557
How would we explain
why we were together

419
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,949
at Sweetwater River at 6:00
a.m. on the Fourth of July?

420
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:15,530
And you're right.

421
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,332
We didn't say anything.

422
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:21,970
We're both going to have
to live with that choice.

423
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,073
Do you understand?

424
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:28,985
I think you should pursue your music,

425
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,379
but not with me.

426
00:20:37,263 --> 00:20:39,392
We're blue! And go!

427
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:41,494
We're dynamite!

428
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,830
We'll take you down,

429
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:46,132
and fight the fight!

430
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:48,501
Whoo! Go, Bulldogs!

431
00:20:49,137 --> 00:20:50,303
Hmm.

432
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:53,543
Ladies, where's the
heat? Where's the sizzle?

433
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:57,243
Well, you haven't seen
our big finish yet.

434
00:20:57,268 --> 00:20:59,933
Don't freak out. Just trust me.

435
00:21:14,197 --> 00:21:16,246
Check your sell-by date, ladies,

436
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:19,983
faux lesbian kissing hasn't
been taboo since 1994.

437
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:23,545
So let's see if you do better with
the interview portion of our audition.

438
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,795
Betty, how's your sister doing?

439
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,893
Um, Polly's fine, thanks for asking.

440
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:31,995
Veronica, has Betty told
you about her sister yet?

441
00:21:31,997 --> 00:21:34,364
- Uh, no.
- Go ahead, Betty.

442
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:37,434
Tell Veronica about your
sister and my dear brother.

443
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:38,868
Polly and Jason dated.

444
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,900
I wouldn't say "dated".

445
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,573
- It didn't end well.
- In fact,

446
00:21:43,598 --> 00:21:46,843
Jason's probably why your
sister had a nervous breakdown

447
00:21:46,845 --> 00:21:49,379
and now lives in a group home, isn't it?

448
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:50,613
That's what my parents think.

449
00:21:50,638 --> 00:21:52,982
What do you have to
say about that, Betty?

450
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:54,684
Go ahead, the floor is yours.

451
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:57,287
Whatever you've been
dying to spew about Jason

452
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:59,889
and how he treated Polly, unleash it.

453
00:21:59,914 --> 00:22:02,459
Destroy me. Tear me a new one.

454
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:04,461
Rip me to shreds. Annihilate me.

455
00:22:04,463 --> 00:22:05,695
I just...

456
00:22:06,665 --> 00:22:07,931
Finally.

457
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:14,944
I just wanted to say I'm sorry

458
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:18,208
about what happened to Jason.

459
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,477
I can't even imagine
what you and your family

460
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,711
must be going through.

461
00:22:23,315 --> 00:22:24,914
Right.

462
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,351
Veronica, welcome to the River Vixens.

463
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:31,821
Betty, better luck next time.

464
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:36,632
Wait, what? Why?

465
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:39,903
Because you couldn't bully
Betty into being a bitch?

466
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:42,131
I need girls with fire on my squad.

467
00:22:43,268 --> 00:22:45,735
I know what you need, Cheryl,

468
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,770
because I know who you are.

469
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:51,407
You would rather people
fear than like you,

470
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:53,877
so you traffic in
terror and intimidation.

471
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:57,614
You're rich, so you've
never been held accountable,

472
00:22:57,616 --> 00:22:59,516
but I'm living proof.

473
00:22:59,518 --> 00:23:01,918
That certainty, that entitlement

474
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,553
you wear on your head like a crown?

475
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:05,573
It won't last.

476
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:08,358
Eventually, there will be a reckoning.

477
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:12,595
Or...

478
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:15,465
Maybe that reckoning is now.

479
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,101
And maybe, that reckoning...

480
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:20,607
Is me.

481
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:24,007
Betty and I come as a matching set.

482
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:25,975
You want one, you take us both.

483
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:27,967
You wanted fire?

484
00:23:28,835 --> 00:23:32,515
Sorry, Cherrybombshell,
my specialty's ice.

485
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:38,321
Go, get around him. Get around him.

486
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:41,257
Let's move.

487
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:42,825
Andrews!

488
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,413
There we go. Looking good.

489
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:52,702
- What's up, Coach?
- Here.

490
00:23:58,216 --> 00:24:00,683
- This is Jason's number.
- It's yours now.

491
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:03,179
Usually, sophomores, they only play JV.

492
00:24:03,181 --> 00:24:05,381
This year, we've got
an open spot in varsity.

493
00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:08,318
From what you've been showing
us, well, I want you to fill it.

494
00:24:08,343 --> 00:24:11,921
Varsity's got longer practices.

495
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:13,189
More away games.

496
00:24:13,191 --> 00:24:14,724
Yeah, bigger commitment, yeah.

497
00:24:14,726 --> 00:24:16,526
Well, I need to think
about it, Coach. I...

498
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:19,028
Oh, what, you got
something better to do?

499
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,100
My dad's company.

500
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,766
It's our family business,

501
00:24:23,768 --> 00:24:25,034
and he's sort of
counting on me to help out

502
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:27,737
- after school, on weekends...
- Hold up, Jackson, hold the ball.

503
00:24:28,577 --> 00:24:30,544
You know what, why
don't you sleep on it.

504
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,983
Let's go. Bring it in, guys. Come on.

505
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,853
Perfect.

506
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:46,756
Very Betty Draper, season 1.

507
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:53,118
Veronica.

508
00:24:54,566 --> 00:24:57,567
Why did... Why did you defend me?

509
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:01,994
I know the crowd you
ran with in New York.

510
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:06,676
Why are you being so... Nice?

511
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:10,279
When my father got arrested,

512
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:13,460
it was the worst thing ever.

513
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:16,252
All these trolls started writing

514
00:25:16,254 --> 00:25:17,920
horrible things about us.

515
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:21,924
We'd get letters and
e-mails saying that

516
00:25:21,926 --> 00:25:23,292
my dad was a thief,

517
00:25:23,317 --> 00:25:25,995
my mom was a clueless socialite,

518
00:25:25,997 --> 00:25:29,799
and that I was the spoiled
rich-bitch ice princess.

519
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:34,311
And what hurt the most about it was...

520
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:38,461
The things the trolls
were writing were true.

521
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:42,765
I was like Cheryl. I
was worse than Cheryl.

522
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,182
So, when my mom said we
were moving to Riverdale,

523
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,318
I made a pact with myself

524
00:25:49,343 --> 00:25:53,990
to use this as an opportunity to become

525
00:25:53,992 --> 00:25:57,960
maybe, hopefully, a
better version of myself.

526
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,330
That's a lot of pressure.

527
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,771
When Polly and Jason got together...

528
00:26:08,773 --> 00:26:10,940
It meant everything to her

529
00:26:10,942 --> 00:26:13,376
and nothing to him,

530
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:16,579
and...

531
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:20,583
And things got super
intense and weird and toxic

532
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:22,452
and my mom turned on Polly.

533
00:26:23,455 --> 00:26:25,788
Said Polly wasn't her daughter anymore,

534
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,558
said all these awful things to her.

535
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,860
Jason hurt Polly,

536
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,074
but it's my mom who broke her.

537
00:26:41,406 --> 00:26:42,605
Archie.

538
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,407
- You're so doing this.
- What?

539
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:46,698
Slaying your dragons,
Betty Cooper, one by one.

540
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:51,247
- Hi, Teen Outlander.
- Hey.

541
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:52,782
Nice outfits.

542
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:56,719
Betty here has something
she wants to ask you

543
00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:58,147
about the Back-to-School dance.

544
00:26:59,303 --> 00:27:01,090
Go on, Betty, ask.

545
00:27:02,427 --> 00:27:06,229
I was wondering if you wanted to come

546
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:08,698
with both of us.

547
00:27:08,723 --> 00:27:10,700
- Huh?
- What?

548
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:14,103
It's your first dance at Riverdale.

549
00:27:14,105 --> 00:27:15,438
You should have someone to go with,

550
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,240
even if it's just a friend.

551
00:27:19,544 --> 00:27:21,410
I mean, I'd love to.

552
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:24,067
I'm not really in the
headspace for a dance.

553
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:26,115
Oh. That's okay.

554
00:27:27,284 --> 00:27:31,220
Totally unacceptable,
Archiekins. We need an escort.

555
00:27:31,245 --> 00:27:34,223
Take a break from being
a tortured musical genius

556
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:36,192
and come spend a blissful evening

557
00:27:36,194 --> 00:27:40,263
with not one, but two
newly-minted River Vixens.

558
00:27:40,288 --> 00:27:42,111
We'll text you time and place.

559
00:27:42,136 --> 00:27:46,235
Okay. Yeah, okay.

560
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,937
- Bye.
- Bye.

561
00:28:06,758 --> 00:28:08,958
What is that?

562
00:28:11,376 --> 00:28:13,278
I made the cheerleading squad.

563
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,365
Cheryl Blossom's cheerleading squad?

564
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,769
After what Jason did to Polly?

565
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:23,172
No, I'm sorry. I won't allow it.

566
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:25,508
Take that off right now.

567
00:28:27,516 --> 00:28:29,859
- No.
- What did you say to me?

568
00:28:30,688 --> 00:28:33,282
I do everything for everyone.

569
00:28:33,952 --> 00:28:36,085
Everything to be perfect.

570
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,835
The perfect daughter, the perfect
sister, the perfect student...

571
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,925
Can't I do this one thing just for me?

572
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,527
- Wait.
- Get out of my way.

573
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:46,863
- Where are you going?
- To buy a dress.

574
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:48,831
Because guess what?

575
00:28:48,856 --> 00:28:51,601
I'm also gong to the dance with Archie.

576
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:54,346
And Veronica.

577
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:56,706
Wait. Hermione Lodge's daughter?

578
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:58,774
She's actually really nice.

579
00:28:58,776 --> 00:29:00,376
And trying to be a good person.

580
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:02,078
You think so?

581
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,641
You think she's going to be your friend?

582
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:05,514
Let me tell you something.

583
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:08,618
Girls like Cheryl and Veronica Lodge,

584
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,952
they don't like girls like us.

585
00:29:09,954 --> 00:29:11,754
I don't want to hear it, Mom.

586
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:14,657
It's happening. I'm going.

587
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:18,895
Thank you, Smithers.

588
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:20,596
As always, you're a godsend.

589
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:22,131
Happy to help, Ms. Hermione.

590
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:24,033
Unlike the rest of Riverdale.

591
00:29:24,636 --> 00:29:26,535
- Hmm.
- What's that?

592
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,337
Oh. Um...

593
00:29:28,362 --> 00:29:31,173
A spot of good news. The car service

594
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:33,743
found and dropped off your missing bag.

595
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:37,220
Missing bag?

596
00:29:46,424 --> 00:29:50,359
Oh, Hiram... What have you done?

597
00:30:06,198 --> 00:30:09,578
I, um... I got a call
from your coach today.

598
00:30:09,603 --> 00:30:11,167
He's under the impression

599
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:12,848
that you can't play varsity football

600
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,618
because I'm making you work for me.

601
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,120
Which is odd, because
you made it seem like

602
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:19,088
you couldn't work for me

603
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,756
because you were playing football.

604
00:30:20,758 --> 00:30:24,013
So my first question is...

605
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:26,796
Who are you lying to?

606
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:28,783
Me or your coach?

607
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:32,672
Neither.

608
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,139
Both.

609
00:30:41,768 --> 00:30:43,601
Dad...

610
00:30:45,814 --> 00:30:47,313
I want to study music,

611
00:30:48,002 --> 00:30:49,719
I want to write music.

612
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:52,221
Football takes you to college.

613
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:53,923
College takes you to business school.

614
00:30:53,925 --> 00:30:56,225
- Business school...
- Takes me back here.

615
00:30:56,227 --> 00:30:57,727
To work for you in Riverdale.

616
00:30:57,752 --> 00:31:00,429
Not for me, with me.

617
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:04,333
And eventually for yourself, son.

618
00:31:04,335 --> 00:31:05,968
The company would be yours.

619
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:09,233
No disrespect, Dad,

620
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,953
but I don't want it.

621
00:31:15,344 --> 00:31:17,646
Three months ago, you did.

622
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:20,509
What happened?

623
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,387
I've changed. Everything's changed.

624
00:31:25,412 --> 00:31:26,956
This summer...

625
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:29,291
This summer what?

626
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:36,385
That's it?

627
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,200
We don't talk anymore?

628
00:31:41,005 --> 00:31:42,171
Dad.

629
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:44,907
I would never force
you to play football.

630
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:47,977
I don't care if you play football.

631
00:31:48,848 --> 00:31:53,115
And you don't have to work
with me or for me, ever again.

632
00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:56,852
But some advice, man-to-man?

633
00:31:56,854 --> 00:31:59,388
These decisions that
you're making now, son,

634
00:31:59,413 --> 00:32:01,690
they have consequences.

635
00:32:01,692 --> 00:32:03,092
They go on to form who you are

636
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:04,933
and who you'll become.

637
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:07,430
Whatever you decide,

638
00:32:07,432 --> 00:32:11,100
be confident enough in it
that you don't have to lie.

639
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:36,039
Well, it's not the Met Ball.

640
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:40,773
Hey. When do you have
to let Coach Clayton

641
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:42,841
- know about football?
- This weekend.

642
00:32:42,843 --> 00:32:45,744
Guys, can't we just liberate ourselves

643
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:48,681
from the tired dichotomy of jock/artist?

644
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:51,917
Can't we, in this post
James Franco world,

645
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,153
be all things at once?

646
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:56,309
I've been working on it, Veronica.

647
00:32:57,124 --> 00:33:00,593
Work faster. I'm getting punch.

648
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,161
You got this.

649
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:07,087
It's about following your heart, right?

650
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:12,231
What does your heart
say? Music or football?

651
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,066
Betty, will you give me one minute?

652
00:33:15,091 --> 00:33:16,609
And I promise, when I get back,

653
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:18,210
I'll be a much better date, okay?

654
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:19,678
I have a plan.

655
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:24,617
Betty, you will not believe
who just propositioned me

656
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:26,485
in the bathroom. Give you a hint...

657
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:28,087
His name may be Moose,

658
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,922
but I'd describe a
certain appendage of his

659
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,690
as horse-like.

660
00:33:38,495 --> 00:33:40,128
Don't panic, I'm not stalking you.

661
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,937
Archie, didn't we have a deal?

662
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:49,008
No, Geraldine, we have a secret,

663
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:51,343
Multiple secrets, actually.

664
00:33:51,368 --> 00:33:54,146
And maybe we could've done
something to help Jason that morning,

665
00:33:54,148 --> 00:33:55,414
or maybe we couldn't have.

666
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,117
And I won't tell anyone anything,

667
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,918
but you need to help me.

668
00:33:59,943 --> 00:34:02,254
This summer, the only
thing that kept me sane

669
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:03,422
was writing these songs.

670
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:07,660
So here's my not-so-indecent proposal.

671
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:09,561
I want to do an
independent study with you,

672
00:34:09,563 --> 00:34:11,864
as many mornings a week as
you can spare, and I swear

673
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:13,232
that's all it'll be.

674
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:17,369
And I won't tell anyone
about July Fourth, ever.

675
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:18,537
Deal?

676
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:26,345
Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
7:30 a.m., before first period.

677
00:34:26,347 --> 00:34:28,320
I'll set it up

678
00:34:28,345 --> 00:34:29,711
and see about getting you credit.

679
00:34:40,961 --> 00:34:42,261
Good evening, friends.

680
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:44,140
Are you all having a good time?

681
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:51,136
As honorary chairperson
and de facto queen

682
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:52,271
of tonight's semiformal,

683
00:34:52,296 --> 00:34:53,906
it is my great pleasure

684
00:34:53,908 --> 00:34:55,748
to introduce this evening's
main entertainment.

685
00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:58,510
To know them is to
be obsessed with them.

686
00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:01,109
Though they usually
perform their own material,

687
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:02,735
tonight, they're making an exception

688
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,672
and debuting a cover of the song my
parents claim they were listening to

689
00:35:05,697 --> 00:35:07,530
the night Jason and I were conceived.

690
00:35:08,112 --> 00:35:09,511
This one's for you, JJ.

691
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:13,658
- Sorry about that.
- I give you Josie and the Pussycats.

692
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,803
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

693
00:35:27,718 --> 00:35:29,051
Did that go okay?

694
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:32,244
Yeah, yes. I'll study with
Ms. Grundy before school,

695
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:34,380
football practice after school,

696
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,115
and work with my dad on the weekends.

697
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:37,316
It's going to be nuts.

698
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:39,925
So long as you don't
give up your passion.

699
00:35:55,202 --> 00:35:56,969
Um...

700
00:35:56,971 --> 00:36:00,139
Now that I'm a River Vixen

701
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:03,776
and you're gonna be on varsity football,

702
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:07,746
I have this fantasy of
us as a power couple...

703
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:11,060
Or maybe even just a couple.

704
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,351
Betty...

705
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,233
Is that so impossible to imagine?

706
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:33,472
Make sure those two turtledoves
come to my after-party.

707
00:36:33,497 --> 00:36:35,340
Veronica too.

708
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:37,443
I'm in the mood for chaos.

709
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,690
It's game time at Chez Blossom, kiddies.

710
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:46,227
We're going old-school tonight.

711
00:36:46,229 --> 00:36:47,828
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

712
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,231
Who wants to tryst in
the Closet of Love first?

713
00:36:50,256 --> 00:36:52,266
My vote is "A" for Archie.

714
00:36:53,453 --> 00:36:54,802
Anyone care to second it?

715
00:36:54,804 --> 00:36:57,805
- Wait, actually...
- Yes, Andrews! Yes.

716
00:36:57,807 --> 00:37:00,441
All right. Gather round, kids.

717
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:03,710
Let's see who's riding the
ginger stallion tonight.

718
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:15,856
Oh, no way!

719
00:37:16,638 --> 00:37:19,539
It's clearly pointing
to... The new girl.

720
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:21,157
This should be fun.

721
00:37:21,182 --> 00:37:23,564
Um... I'm not doing this.

722
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:25,700
That's up to you.

723
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,234
But, if you don't,

724
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:30,133
house rules decree the
hostess gets to take your turn.

725
00:37:39,015 --> 00:37:42,149
I know her brother died and everything,

726
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:43,451
but...

727
00:37:43,453 --> 00:37:46,587
Cheryl Blossom truly is the antichrist.

728
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:54,303
So, uh, do you miss New York?

729
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:57,932
It's been less than a week.

730
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,901
But... Yes.

731
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,322
Six minutes, twenty seconds.

732
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:08,142
Okay. Your turn.

733
00:38:08,144 --> 00:38:10,611
Ask me a deep, probing question

734
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:12,413
to kill time.

735
00:38:14,717 --> 00:38:17,651
It looked like you and Betty
were having fun at the dance.

736
00:38:17,676 --> 00:38:20,269
Definitely. We've been friends forever.

737
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,357
- My turn.
- I didn't ask my question yet.

738
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,560
Is that all it is?

739
00:38:26,562 --> 00:38:28,562
Just friends?

740
00:38:29,514 --> 00:38:31,876
We're not just friends,
we're best friends.

741
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:37,538
My turn. Did you have
a boyfriend in New York?

742
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:40,141
No.

743
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:42,309
My turn.

744
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:45,346
Could it ever possibly
become something more?

745
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:47,782
Are you asking for
Betty or for yourself?

746
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:51,352
For Betty, and you
didn't answer my question.

747
00:38:51,377 --> 00:38:54,421
I have never felt... Whatever it is

748
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:56,557
I'm supposed to feel

749
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:57,758
with Betty.

750
00:38:57,783 --> 00:38:59,693
Have you felt it, though?

751
00:39:01,164 --> 00:39:02,663
With anyone?

752
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:04,465
Yeah.

753
00:39:06,702 --> 00:39:08,068
This summer.

754
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:12,006
- Have you?
- Maybe once.

755
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:18,979
You're a little more dangerous
than you look, aren't you?

756
00:39:20,713 --> 00:39:22,346
All boy-next-door-ish?

757
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:25,900
You have no idea.

758
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,389
Your turn.

759
00:39:33,695 --> 00:39:37,263
Ask me a question, Archie.

760
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:42,755
Ask me anything you want.

761
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:51,712
We shouldn't do this.

762
00:39:51,714 --> 00:39:53,013
We definitely shouldn't do this.

763
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:05,420
Nailed it.

764
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:06,888
Yes.

765
00:40:08,613 --> 00:40:09,812
Where's Betty?

766
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:11,960
She spiraled and fled.

767
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:14,396
Between us, she's a lot more
high-strung than she looks.

768
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:16,798
You shady bitch.

769
00:40:19,281 --> 00:40:21,036
Crap. Betty's cell is off.

770
00:40:21,038 --> 00:40:22,337
- I'm getting an Uber.
- Can I come with you?

771
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:23,505
We should probably try to find her.

772
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,607
Believe me. The last thing Betty wants

773
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:27,709
is us tracking her down together.

774
00:40:28,723 --> 00:40:30,089
We messed up.

775
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:43,677
Hey, you're home early.
How was the dance?

776
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,443
It was fine.

777
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:49,751
I mean, it's not the
Met Ball or anything...

778
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,130
Tell me about it. You can cheer me up.

779
00:40:53,103 --> 00:40:54,569
I'm super tired, Mom.

780
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:01,606
Is everything okay?

781
00:41:04,405 --> 00:41:06,205
Ronnie, what is it?

782
00:41:14,191 --> 00:41:17,559
It was midnight, and my
old friend Archie Andrews

783
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:21,106
arrived at the one place
in town that was still open.

784
00:41:21,131 --> 00:41:23,598
He was looking for the girl next door.

785
00:41:25,702 --> 00:41:27,969
Instead, he found me.

786
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:34,228
Hey, Pop. Betty hasn't
come in tonight, has she?

787
00:41:34,253 --> 00:41:37,712
Nope. Just the night hawks in tonight.

788
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:40,340
Thanks.

789
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,524
Uh, can I sit, Jughead?

790
00:41:50,027 --> 00:41:51,293
If you want.

791
00:41:53,665 --> 00:41:56,166
- What are you working on?
- My novel.

792
00:41:57,088 --> 00:41:59,548
It's about this summer,
and Jason Blossom.

793
00:41:59,573 --> 00:42:02,464
Seventeen years old and
how will he be remembered?

794
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:05,640
As captain of the water polo team?

795
00:42:05,642 --> 00:42:07,309
The Aquaholics?

796
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:10,512
Considering how he died, probably not.

797
00:42:10,537 --> 00:42:12,414
No, what I mean is...

798
00:42:14,585 --> 00:42:17,214
Was he doing everything
he was supposed to do,

799
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:20,315
everything he wanted. I mean,
did he even know what that was?

800
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:27,128
Coach Clayton was in
here talking to Pop Tate.

801
00:42:27,598 --> 00:42:28,830
Varsity.

802
00:42:30,234 --> 00:42:33,268
Does that make you, what,
Mr. Popular Football God now?

803
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:34,693
No.

804
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:38,306
In fact, I'm kind of terrified

805
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,175
I lost my best friend tonight.

806
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,399
If you mean Betty,

807
00:42:41,424 --> 00:42:44,479
whatever happened, just talk to her.

808
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:47,148
You know, it'd go a long way.

809
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:53,105
Would've gone a long way with me.

810
00:43:24,488 --> 00:43:25,987
I'm not going to ask what you did

811
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:27,689
with Veronica at Cheryl's.

812
00:43:30,811 --> 00:43:32,994
But I'm asking you now, right now,

813
00:43:32,996 --> 00:43:34,796
if you love me, Archie.

814
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:38,980
Or even like me?

815
00:43:39,005 --> 00:43:40,902
Of course I love you, Betty.

816
00:43:43,615 --> 00:43:45,802
But I can't give you
the answer you want.

817
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:48,209
Why?

818
00:43:51,784 --> 00:43:53,351
You are so perfect.

819
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:57,719
I've never been good enough for you.

820
00:43:59,284 --> 00:44:00,984
I'll never be good enough for you.

821
00:44:20,143 --> 00:44:23,878
And so, it wasn't one
heart that broke that night.

822
00:44:23,903 --> 00:44:25,269
It was two.

823
00:44:27,718 --> 00:44:30,085
And the night was far from over.

824
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,792
For the record, I'm not gay.

825
00:44:37,794 --> 00:44:40,662
Obviously not, Moose.
You're on the football team.

826
00:44:40,664 --> 00:44:43,634
But if you were gay,
what would you like to do?

827
00:44:43,659 --> 00:44:45,967
Everything but kiss.

828
00:44:45,992 --> 00:44:48,097
I love a good closet case.

829
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:51,573
So, let's start with skinny-dipping

830
00:44:51,575 --> 00:44:53,174
and then see what happens?

831
00:44:53,176 --> 00:44:56,311
Dude, are you okay?

832
00:45:12,896 --> 00:45:14,295
Oh, my God, it's Jason.

833
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,753
He was shot.

834
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:21,536
By morning, everyone
would be talking, texting,

835
00:45:21,538 --> 00:45:23,405
and posting about it.

836
00:45:23,407 --> 00:45:25,340
We'd all be feeling it.

837
00:45:25,365 --> 00:45:29,900
That the world around us
had changed, maybe forever.

838
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:34,537
That Riverdale wasn't
the same town as before.

839
00:45:34,562 --> 00:45:38,119
That it was a town of
shadows and secrets now.

840
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:41,733
On Monday, the autopsy on Jason's body

841
00:45:41,758 --> 00:45:42,924
would take place.

842
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:47,328
And on Tuesday, halfway
through fifth period,

843
00:45:47,353 --> 00:45:49,822
the first arrest would be made.

844
