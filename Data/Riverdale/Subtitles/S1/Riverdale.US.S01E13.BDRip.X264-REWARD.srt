1
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:05,840
<i>It was the ultimate cliffhanger.</i>

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:09,594
<i>Clifford Blossom had
killed himself. But why?</i>

3
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:13,473
<i>Life's not an Agatha Christie
novel. It's a lot messier.</i>

4
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:16,101
What the hell is Cliff Blossom
doing with drugs?

5
00:00:16,476 --> 00:00:20,230
<i>Turns out,
maple syrup was a front
for his true business.</i>

6
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:23,108
<i>Transporting heroin from
Montreal on his trucks.</i>

7
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:26,111
<i>A narrative quickly emerged.</i>

8
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:29,614
<i>That Jason Blossom
learned about
dear old Dad's drug running,</i>

9
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:31,783
<i>and threatened to expose
the truth.</i>

10
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:33,493
<i>Which led to Jason's abduction</i>

11
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:36,705
<i>at the hands of a Southside
Serpent named Mustang.</i>

12
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:40,041
<i>And then to Jason's murder
at the hands of his father.</i>

13
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,752
<i>Clifford killed
Mustang to cover his tracks,</i>

14
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,879
<i>making it look like
he'd overdosed,</i>

15
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:47,048
<i>and tried to implicate
a rival businessman,</i>

16
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:50,885
<i>Hiram Lodge, as having
masterminded the whole thing.</i>

17
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:53,555
<i>And, oh, yeah,
I almost forgot.</i>

18
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:55,473
<i>Mr. Blossom threatened
my life,</i>

19
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:58,309
<i>so that my dad would confess
to pulling the trigger,</i>

20
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:00,854
<i>even though all he did
was clean up the mess.</i>

21
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,397
Here you go, Juggy.

22
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,315
<i>And he would have
gotten away with it, too,</i>

23
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:07,736
<i>if it wasn't for
a group of pesky kids
who uncovered the truth.</i>

24
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:11,281
<i>Even as Clifford Blossom,
consumed by guilt and shame,</i>

25
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,782
<i>took the coward's way out...</i>

26
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:15,326
<i>Jason's murder
had revealed some dark truths</i>

27
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,537
<i>none of us were
too eager to face.</i>

28
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:19,372
<i>Especially not Mayor McCoy,</i>

29
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:22,792
<i>who wanted every last vestige
of corruption crushed</i>

30
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,712
<i>like a snake
under a boot heel.</i>

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,881
So, Blossom was the kingpin,

32
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,592
he funneled drugs
through Riverdale and
then shipped them out.

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,305
What the Mayor and I care
about is the local component
of Blossom's business.

34
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:38,308
Someone is selling his drugs
here in Riverdale.

35
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,018
- Mostly in the Southside...
- Hmm.

36
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,479
...but it's started to cross
the tracks, recently, too.

37
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,190
- And you think
it's the Serpents?
- Who else?

38
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:46,691
So here's the deal.

39
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,362
You feed us names,
tell me who's pushing
the dope,

40
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,698
and the Mayor, the DA
have a chat,

41
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:56,201
and maybe he'd be inclined
to offer you a
lesser sentence.

42
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,119
Serpents don't get into
the hard stuff.

43
00:01:58,328 --> 00:01:59,746
It's dime bags of weed.

44
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,414
And I'm no snitch.

45
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:07,879
FP, if you don't help us
and your case goes to trial,

46
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:09,214
there will be no leniency.

47
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:12,175
You'll be looking at 20 years
in a federal penitentiary

48
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,844
for your part in the cover-up
of Jason Blossom's murder.

49
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:27,982
Dad?

50
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:30,944
You okay?

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,613
I thought I knew this town.

52
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:35,782
I bet everything on it.

53
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,661
If I could cut bait...

54
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,622
How are you holding up?

55
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:44,916
I mean, I'm...
I'm dealing.

56
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:49,170
But for Jughead and
for Betty and Veronica,
Dad, it's not over.

57
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,339
They're still in it. Big time.

58
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:59,013
We're all still in it.
Up to our necks.

59
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:04,352
<i>And when should
I be expecting Mr. Lodge?</i>

60
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,980
Not until the end of
the month, but everything
has to be perfect.

61
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,732
Yes, we would not want
to make Daddy angry.

62
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,401
That'll be all, Smithers.
Thank you.

63
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,867
He's your father, Veronica,
not the Godfather.

64
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:26,291
<i>They're acting like
the last week and the last few
months didn't even happen.</i>

65
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,877
<i>Polly's back home,
my dad's back home,</i>

66
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,545
<i>my mom's back at</i> The Register.

67
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:35,633
<i>They all just keep smiling
and talking about the Jubilee.</i>

68
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:37,343
- That's good, right?
- No.

69
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:39,304
No, it's horrible.

70
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:44,642
It's exactly the way things
were before, pretending to
be normal and perfect

71
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:49,230
when really, we're like...
Like a Greek suburban tragedy.

72
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:55,153
My family imploded, Arch,

73
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,405
and we barely survived.

74
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:00,658
If we don't start dealing
with our crap, it's all
gonna happen again.

75
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:04,287
<i>Okay, Archie.</i>

76
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:07,332
Now that we're not actively
investigating a murder case,

77
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,335
we need to come clean to Betty
about our pas de deux.

78
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:12,545
- What?
- Our romance.

79
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:15,381
Aw, definitely. But, Ronnie,
we have to be careful.

80
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,343
The last time I had this
kind of conversation with
Betty, it didn't go well.

81
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,220
Forget it, I'll tell her.

82
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,930
On top of everything else
I'm dealing with right now,

83
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:23,806
I'll tell Betty that
we're semi-dating.

84
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,433
<i>Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper,</i>

85
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:27,227
<i>report to
the Principal's office.</i>

86
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,355
Archie. Betty.

87
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,398
I'd like to feature you both
at the Jubilee.

88
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,777
As you know,
it's our 75th anniversary
of our town's founding,

89
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,905
and also a kickoff for
the next 75 years.

90
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,699
And who better represents
the future of Riverdale

91
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:46,704
than the young people
who, working with Sheriff
Keller and my office,

92
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:50,792
helped bring peace and justice
to our streets once more?

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,086
But, that's not exactly
what happened...

94
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,004
Let the Mayor finish,
Ms. Cooper.

95
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:58,132
Archie, the Pussycats
will be performing
at the Jubilee,

96
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:00,718
and I would love for you
to join them.

97
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:05,890
Betty, I think it's important
that we hear from Riverdale's
best and brightest.

98
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:07,684
- What do you say, both of you?
- Uh...

99
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:09,227
What about Jughead?

100
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:13,564
I, uh... I like Jughead.

101
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:17,235
And he's welcome to attend
the Jubilee, of course.

102
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,904
But his father is in jail,

103
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:22,198
and think it might
be confusing

104
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:23,741
to have him up
on the Jubilee stage.

105
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,035
That's so unfair, Mayor McCoy.

106
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:30,498
Betty, Archie, you're heroes.

107
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:33,376
The kind of heroes
that Riverdale desperately

108
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,794
needs right about now.

109
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,340
<i>I told her I wouldn't do it.</i>

110
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:41,592
Not unless you're
up there with us, Jug.

111
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,429
I appreciate the righteous
indignation, Betty, I do,

112
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:46,222
but Jubilees aren't my thing.

113
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:47,974
Jug, how's your dad?
Did you get in to see him?

114
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,767
Here's the latest.

115
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:52,020
Mayor McCoy wants
my dad to name names

116
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,563
in exchange for
a lesser sentence.

117
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,231
What? Whose names?

118
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,567
The Serpents. Sheriff Keller
thinks they're the ones

119
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,652
dealing the drugs that
Clifford Blossom brought
into the town.

120
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:02,572
My dad says more and more
drugs are hitting the streets.

121
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,241
Kevin, relax,
this isn't <i>The Wire.</i>

122
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:08,077
My dad says they're
not the ones dealing.

123
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:11,414
And meanwhile, Mayor McCoy
hasn't even said the words

124
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,624
"Clifford" or "Blossom"
in public.

125
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,502
It's all about how
the Serpents are the problem,
the villains.

126
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:17,879
This is outrageous.

127
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,464
I'm writing an article
about this,

128
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,382
and not just for
<i>The Blue and Gold,</i>
for <i>The Register.</i>

129
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,051
This is a town story.

130
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,844
Okay, as long as the article
doesn't include my dad.

131
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:27,263
No, it is going to be
about your dad, Jug.

132
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:31,684
It doesn't matter how many
Jubilees Mayor McCoy throws.

133
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:35,772
This town's changed.
That needs to be acknowledged.

134
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,815
Why are people
so afraid of the truth?

135
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,069
Speaking of the truth...

136
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,990
Archie and I wanted
to tell you...

137
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:50,995
We've kissed a couple
of times.

138
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,540
It's okay, Vee.

139
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,834
I appreciate you
being honest with me,

140
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,169
but I'm with Jughead now.

141
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:01,839
If you guys want
to be together,
I'm happy for you.

142
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:03,966
Thanks, Bee.

143
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,051
Thanks, Betty.

144
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:14,268
It was to have been
the grandest funeral
in Riverdale history.

145
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,647
Instead, he was buried
like a pauper.

146
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,567
Why are you crying?
You hated him.

147
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:26,864
Don't...
Don't say that, Mommy...

148
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,492
We've always been cursed

149
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,079
ever since the original murder
when brother killed brother.

150
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:37,708
Who will the Grim Reaper
take next? You? Me?

151
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:42,088
Maybe your father had
the right idea. Just end it.

152
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:47,718
Better the sweet hereafter
than this awful limbo.

153
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,780
Betty, I know you said you were
okay about me and Veronica,

154
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:09,574
but I just wanted to make
sure, because...

155
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:13,286
Because last time I said
I was okay, I wasn't.

156
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:17,582
But this time,
I promise I am.

157
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,749
Great.

158
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,879
You and Veronica, you're...

159
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:26,132
I like her, a lot.
She's amazing.

160
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:33,181
But a little part of me
always thought...

161
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:34,932
We're both so lucky.

162
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:38,853
I mean, don't you think?

163
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:42,190
To have found the people
that we were meant to be with.

164
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:44,233
And that we're all friends.

165
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:46,736
I mean,
who would have thought,

166
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,613
at the beginning
of the school year?

167
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:51,324
Yeah.

168
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,117
Who would have thought?

169
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,873
You wanna tell me
who those guys are out there?

170
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,750
Our new crew.
I let the Serpents go.

171
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,502
You fired them?
Why would you do that?

172
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,545
The Mayor and Sheriff Keller
are cracking down.

173
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:06,172
Especially on the Serpents.

174
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,091
Those guys stood by us, okay?
When we had no one else.

175
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,093
Hiram is coming home.

176
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:13,262
I can't let him,
or this project,

177
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,764
be associated with criminals.

178
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,724
You don't get to make
unilateral decisions.

179
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,559
'Cause we're partners,
remember?

180
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:23,648
Actually,
Hiram and I have talked,

181
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,359
and we'd like to buy you out.

182
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:29,487
Fred.

183
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:33,366
I've dragged you into
a situation that you never
wanted to be a part of.

184
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,162
Make me an offer in writing.

185
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,498
I'll consider it.

186
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,169
It's really good, Archie.

187
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:46,921
Each song, you're getting
better and better.

188
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,674
- That's great, Josie.
- Yeah.

189
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,050
'Cause I was hoping
we could...

190
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,677
Oh, we can't sing it
at the Jubilee.

191
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,097
No, my mom already
approved <i>Astronaut.</i>

192
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,891
- But my song is about...
- Your friends.

193
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,227
Who've been through
hell and back, I get it.

194
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,771
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Yeah. So...

195
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,399
The Jubilee, that's for
the entire town.

196
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,192
Not just your friends.

197
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,786
It's the best thing
you've ever written.

198
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:22,832
It's passionate,
it's compelling, but...

199
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,000
But you won't publish it.

200
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,045
- Why not?
- You're too involved.

201
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,338
People out there
are going to think

202
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,340
that you wrote it as a favor
to your boyfriend's dad.

203
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,050
No, I wrote it
because this is the truth.

204
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,594
It's one version
of the truth, honey.

205
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,637
Oh, my God. Mom.

206
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,764
You're just as bad
as Mayor McCoy.

207
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,850
We're just as bad
as this whole town.

208
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:44,103
The other reason
we don't want you
publishing this anywhere,

209
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:47,356
- is there's been reports
of attacks on the Southside.
- What?

210
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:50,067
Betty, people,
not just the police,

211
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:51,694
are going after the Serpents.

212
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,113
The whole town agrees
with Mayor McCoy.

213
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,032
Crime is spreading.

214
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,867
There's real anger
out there, Betty.

215
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,910
And they're needing
to focus it somewhere.

216
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,371
Right now, it's the Serpents,

217
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,874
and we don't want you
suddenly becoming a target.

218
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:12,715
Cheryl, I'm so sorry I'm late.

219
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,634
All you missed
was my abdication.

220
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,218
The Vixens are in the gym

221
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,721
awaiting you,
their new directorix.

222
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,349
- What?
- And I wanted
to give you this.

223
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,102
Your HBIC shirt?

224
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,021
These last few days have
put things in perspective.

225
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:29,732
I understand.

226
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,235
But if you personally
need anything...

227
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:34,737
I'm fine.

228
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:38,699
I've shed my tears
for the Blossom men.

229
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:43,079
It was chilling, Betty.

230
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:45,915
I'm telling you,
there are some dark
goings on at Thornhill.

231
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,084
Well, not just at Thornhill.
Town wide.

232
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:51,087
You can feel it. Something
wicked this way comes.

233
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,923
Which reminds me,
I loved your article.

234
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,383
Good, because
I already posted it

235
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,510
on the <i>Blue and Gold's</i>
website,

236
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,554
with hardcopies in circulation
tomorrow morning.

237
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:04,350
Betty, now that
it's just us girls,

238
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,852
and at the risk of us
failing the Bechdel test,

239
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,772
are you legitimately cool
with Archie and me?

240
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,232
Swear on the September issue?

241
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,318
And on my copy of <i>Forever</i>
by Judy Blume.

242
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,572
Aw, I miss this.

243
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:22,326
Gossiping, doing homework,
being a River Vixen.

244
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:24,286
Basically just going
to school.

245
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:25,329
Then come back.

246
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:26,664
Mom doesn't want me to.

247
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,583
Naturally, but what she
doesn't know won't hurt her.

248
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,256
That hottie kept
looking at you.

249
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,467
Hey, guys. Um...

250
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,387
This is Ms. Weiss
from Social Services.

251
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,140
She's, uh...
She's Jughead's case worker.

252
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:47,017
Jughead, I know how
terrible and emotional

253
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,853
the last few days
have been for you.

254
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,313
Your father's facing
serious jail time.

255
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,607
Your mom's over-extended
and out of state.

256
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,860
We just want to make sure
that you're taken care of.

257
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,653
Well, he can keep staying
with us, right, Dad?

258
00:12:57,862 --> 00:12:59,989
I offered already, Arch.

259
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,198
Great, so what's the problem?

260
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,701
It was a DUI.

261
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,495
After your mom left.
Look, we can talk
about this later

262
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:11,250
but between that
and my cash flow problem,
it knocks me out.

263
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,337
There is a family on
the Southside that's
offered to foster you.

264
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,506
They're good people,
they've worked with us before.

265
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,967
That doesn't sound
completely horrible.

266
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:23,429
It does mean
you'll be in a different
school district, Jughead,

267
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,222
and you'll have to
transfer schools.

268
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,141
What the hell?
When is all this
supposed to happen?

269
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,893
The paperwork's
been processed.

270
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,729
Unless there is a radical
change in your father's case,

271
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,981
you'll be on the Southside
by the end of the week.

272
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:47,953
They're saying he has
to live on the Southside,
with a foster family,

273
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:50,080
and then transfer
to Southside High.

274
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,875
That place is no joke.

275
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,419
If there's a deal on
the table, Mr. Jones,
you've gotta take it.

276
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:58,547
It tears me up, Red,
but the Serpents are my tribe.

277
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,591
They're also innocent,
not that anyone
in this town cares.

278
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,219
We care, believe me.
But...

279
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,555
Nobody wants you
to go to jail for 20 years,
especially not Jughead.

280
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,474
That kid knows what's what.

281
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,143
He knows you can't betray
the folks that stand by you.

282
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:13,729
- Who got your back.
- And that's the Serpents?

283
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:15,481
When the time comes,
they'll step up.

284
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,443
Hey, Jughead's a tough kid.

285
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:22,279
Scrappy. A survivor.

286
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:24,782
He'll make it.

287
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:27,993
Especially if you're looking
after him.

288
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,870
And he'll try to pull
away from you,

289
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,332
he'll try to disappear
into himself.

290
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,543
He needs his friends.

291
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:39,004
That's why you and Betty,
you gotta stick with him.

292
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,506
No matter what.

293
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,800
He's got some darkness in him.

294
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:48,472
Betty's babysitting Polly,
mind if I join you?

295
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:51,100
Are you sure you want to sit
at the social pariah table?

296
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,312
I've been sitting at it
for months, why should
today be any different?

297
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,274
By the way,
I've been thinking.

298
00:14:58,482 --> 00:14:59,650
You and I have a lot
in common.

299
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:03,070
Oh, because my dad's
going to prison and
your dad is getting out?

300
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,781
We're dating
each other's best friends,
I was going to say.

301
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,200
But yes,
the prison thing, too.

302
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:09,869
Jughead.

303
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,037
I'm sorry.

304
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:14,832
I had no right to pummel you
the way I did that day.

305
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,085
As recompense,
I'd like to give you this.

306
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:21,964
My iconic spider brooch.

307
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,885
It'll catch a pretty penny
at the local pawn shop.

308
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,679
Enough to keep you in burgers
and "S" T-shirts for years,

309
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:30,097
if not decades.

310
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:32,016
Cheryl, what is going on?

311
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,477
- I'm...
Guys, hurry.
It's Betty's locker.

312
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:37,229
Come on, it's bad.
Come on, come on!

313
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:40,733
What's going on?

314
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:41,984
Come with us.

315
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,822
Check it out!

316
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:55,831
Betty.

317
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,626
Betty. Hey, no...

318
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,086
It's nothing, Jug,
it's just a jerk with
a can of spray paint.

319
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,297
I don't think that's
spray paint, okay?

320
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,470
<i>It was pig's blood, Dad.</i>

321
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,013
Where do you even
get pig's blood?

322
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,265
I wanna slam whoever
did that through a wall.

323
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:16,435
Betty's getting threats.
Jughead is being thrown
into a snake pit,

324
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:17,895
and I can't do anything
to help them.

325
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,438
Sometimes you help them
just by showing up.

326
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,899
I've been showing up
all year, Dad.

327
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,652
And it hasn't made
one bit of difference.

328
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,655
We're getting
our asses kicked.

329
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,368
As long as you're with me,
you're writing articles
about me and my dad,

330
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,787
trouble's just gonna
keep coming at you
from all sides.

331
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,290
- It was just one jerk.
- It's not just one jerk.

332
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,876
It's Mayor McCoy.
It's Sheriff Keller.

333
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,171
It's Weatherbee,
it's Social Services,

334
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:47,132
it's the entire
multiverse telling me
that I don't belong here,

335
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,259
- so why don't I just do
everyone a favour...
- Hey, hey.

336
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,722
You belong here just
as much as everyone else.

337
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:54,974
This is your home.

338
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,435
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

339
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,272
Yes.

340
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,159
Let me guess, for Daddy?

341
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,370
Veronica, wait.

342
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:19,915
You and Archie...

343
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,750
Getting closer?

344
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,503
Maybe, why do you ask?

345
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,631
Your father and I made
Fred an offer

346
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,675
to buy out the
SoDale contract,

347
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,468
but Fred is still
on the fence about it.

348
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,848
I was hoping maybe
you could talk to Archie.

349
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,308
Maybe he could convince
Fred to sell?

350
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,478
Yeah, sure, Mom. No problem.

351
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:44,148
I'll just sexually manipulate
Archie into doing my bidding.

352
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:45,816
As long as you're in control.

353
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,236
Oh, my God, Mom,
I was kidding.

354
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:53,282
Also, why are you trying
to push Fred out of this deal?

355
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,243
He's the only person
in this town who was loyal.

356
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,620
- Who was good to you.
- Your father is coming back.

357
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:02,041
He and Fred?
They will not get along.

358
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,591
- So, you took Polly to school?
- I'm so sorry, Betty.

359
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,052
Nothing happened at school,
it was fine.

360
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,136
Fine?

361
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,721
So, no one wrote
on your locker,

362
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,306
"Go to hell, Serpent Slut,"

363
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,308
and hung a Betty doll
from a noose?

364
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,684
Jeez, Poll. Is there anything
you didn't tell her?

365
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,102
She wouldn't stop grilling me!

366
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,646
I warned you, Elizabeth,
about publishing that article.

367
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,316
- Why do you
constantly defy me?
- Because.

368
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:32,321
I'm sick of all the secrets
and the lies in this town
and in this family.

369
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,948
I would much rather take
some heat for being honest

370
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,492
than do what you're doing.

371
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,660
Living in fear of the truth.

372
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:42,414
I am scared for you,
Elizabeth, not of the truth.

373
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:43,957
Oh, really?

374
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,294
Let's go then.

375
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,464
You talk a big game
about liking Jughead,

376
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,382
but wouldn't you
be much happier if
we weren't together?

377
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:55,677
Thought so.

378
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,763
Question number two,

379
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,389
when you invited FP
over for dinner,

380
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,183
he said that you and Dad
got in a huge fight

381
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,976
when you were in high school,
at Homecoming.

382
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,436
Your mom ever tell you
about that night?

383
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:05,979
Shut up, FP.

384
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,107
- What was that about?
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

385
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,567
Oh, come on, Mom.
I saw the look on your face.

386
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,402
You were terrified.

387
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:13,862
What were you so scared
he was going to say?

388
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,073
That is none of your
damn business!

389
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:27,126
Dad was keeping a secret
that almost destroyed us.

390
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,295
How many are you keeping?

391
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,343
<i>Mommy, I was going to ask.</i>

392
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,304
Can I stay at home today?

393
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,098
Absolutely not.

394
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:44,518
It's so hard, Mommy,
pretending everything's...

395
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,312
I don't care.

396
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,826
Here for round two?

397
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:06,331
There are some secrets
that are so painful,

398
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,709
you not only hide them
from the world,

399
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,878
but you hide them
from yourself.

400
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,298
What do you mean?

401
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:19,219
The night of the Homecoming,

402
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:23,056
when your father and I
were crowned King and Queen,

403
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,892
the fight that FP saw,

404
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,646
I had just told your father
that I was pregnant.

405
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,529
And we disagreed
on how best to handle...

406
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:39,865
Things.

407
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,410
And we had a really big fight.

408
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,079
And the next day, I went away.

409
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,497
To the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

410
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:48,832
Yeah.

411
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,294
And five months later,
your brother was born.

412
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:56,757
The Sisters arranged
for a quiet adoption.

413
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:04,056
Oh, my God, Mom. I'm so sorry.

414
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,351
It's the biggest regret
of my life.

415
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:14,024
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, honey.

416
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,984
It's okay, Mom.

417
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:21,615
The craziest thing is,
I have a secret brother
out there in the world.

418
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,618
It's positively Dickensian.
I love a long-lost brother.

419
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,162
- How old would he be?
- Mid-twenties.

420
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,414
Oh, my God.
A blond Adonis, no doubt.

421
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,879
Hey, where are you?
Have you been getting
my messages?

422
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:39,216
Oh, my God. What?

423
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,928
This is where I belong, okay?

424
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,847
Let's talk about this
after school.

425
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,349
Please don't worry about me.

426
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,694
- Where is he?
- Southside High.

427
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:00,654
He said it's
where he belongs

428
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,322
and that no one
wants him here.

429
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,616
FP warned me
Jughead would cut himself off,

430
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:05,993
go to the dark side.

431
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,828
Archie, we can't
let him do that.

432
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,152
Where would he be?

433
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,154
Cafeteria.

434
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:53,915
Jug...

435
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,835
What are you guys doing here?

436
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,257
I didn't tell you
ahead of time

437
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,675
because I knew you
would've tried to stop me.

438
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:06,011
Damn straight.
And I'm still gonna try.

439
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:10,098
Betty, the Southside is where
the powers that be want me.

440
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,352
Maybe I wanna
be here as well.
I may blend in better here.

441
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,145
And it would keep you safe.

442
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:18,774
I'm not letting Riverdale's
civil war split us apart, Jug.

443
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,740
They're each other's
soulmates.

444
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,242
Good for them,
don't you think?

445
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,789
Archie, what is it?

446
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,959
Ronnie, I...

447
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,419
Wait.

448
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,010
- Oh, my God.
- What?

449
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:48,470
Where would Cheryl go
to be with Jason?

450
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,597
- Sweetwater River.
- We have to go!

451
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:52,724
Guys, we have to go!

452
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,559
Cheryl?

453
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:56,728
Cheryl?

454
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:00,399
Cheryl?

455
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:06,405
She's not here.

456
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:09,825
- Over there! Oh, my God.
- She's over there!

457
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,284
Cheryl!

458
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,328
Cheryl, stop!
What are you doing?

459
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,163
Wait, wait! Wait, Jug!

460
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,208
The ice. He's right.

461
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,626
Too much weight,
and we'll all go under.

462
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,044
Cheryl!

463
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:22,963
Cheryl, please.

464
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:33,390
Just come to the shore
and we'll figure this out
together, okay?

465
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,396
No!

466
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,772
Cheryl!

467
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:45,694
Cheryl!

468
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:47,779
- Cheryl!
- Cheryl!

469
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,035
The current has her.

470
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,872
Spread out, spread out!

471
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,298
She's here! She's here!

472
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:11,303
- Archie, be careful!
- Help!

473
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:13,638
Somebody help!

474
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,075
Archie!

475
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,538
Come on!

476
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:13,156
Cheryl!

477
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:30,632
Hey.

478
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:32,968
Hot chocolate?

479
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:37,013
With a little splash
of peppermint liqueur.

480
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,807
- Thank you.
- No problem.

481
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,059
Are you warm enough?

482
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:44,646
What is she doing here?

483
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,113
She got in an accident.

484
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,324
And she needed help,
so I brought her here.

485
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,410
I'll just warm up and go home.

486
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,497
Fine, Ronnie.

487
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,791
Let's go. I'll give you
a ride to the Jubilee.

488
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:08,878
Already got one with
Archie, Lady Macbeth.

489
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,272
- Ready, sweetheart?
- Almost.

490
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,613
Don't be nervous
about your speech.

491
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:37,324
Just be your wonderful self.

492
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,160
It's not about
the speech, Mom.

493
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,204
It's Jughead.

494
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,501
He's moving in
with a foster family

495
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:52,088
and transferring
to Southside High.

496
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:56,843
And he says it won't change
anything between us,

497
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:57,969
but...

498
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:02,057
It will.

499
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:13,193
That's what you get
for punching a river of ice.

500
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,153
Are you sure you
should be performing?

501
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,448
Freshman year,
I played the whole season
with a broken hand.

502
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:19,908
Well, a taped-up hand.

503
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,870
Hey. You okay?

504
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:27,040
When we were
at Southside High,

505
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:31,211
you were looking
at Betty and Jughead...

506
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,505
I don't know, wistfully.

507
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:35,799
- Wistfully?
- Longingly.

508
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:39,219
Like you liked Betty.

509
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:42,263
I do. I always will.

510
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,099
As friends.

511
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,643
The moment
you're talking about,

512
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,272
I was seeing Betty and Jughead

513
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,191
and I was seeing
how good they were,

514
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:57,612
and it confirmed how I've
been feeling this last week.

515
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,031
I want to be that for you.

516
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,576
A soulmate?

517
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,956
A broad shoulder I can cry on
every now and then?

518
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,583
Yeah.

519
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,170
I'd love that, Archie.

520
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:28,101
Earlier,
your girl Vee, here,

521
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,270
called to tell me
what happened with Cheryl.

522
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,773
I've reconsidered something.

523
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,942
About your song.

524
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:37,652
<i>Welcome, one and all,</i>

525
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:42,157
<i>to Riverdale's
75th anniversary
Jubilee celebration!</i>

526
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:49,205
I couldn't be any more
thrilled to introduce

527
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:52,500
my daughter, Josie,
and her Pussycats,

528
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:58,006
as they perform alongside our
local hero, Archie Andrews!

529
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:05,555
Hi, hi, everyone.

530
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,307
We're switching things
up tonight.

531
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:12,520
We are singing a song
that my boy,
Archie Andrews, wrote.

532
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,191
So...

533
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:31,247
<i>♪ Every moment we're together</i>

534
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:38,713
<i>♪ Is a moment I remember</i>

535
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:42,509
Sheriff Keller
tells me that you still
haven't given any names.

536
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:44,219
He's hoping I can
convince you otherwise.

537
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:46,721
I've been sweating it out,
Jug, and, uh,

538
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:51,226
the only conclusion
I've come to is
that both options suck.

539
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,563
Hey, I wanted to
let you know that I...

540
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:58,817
I'm gonna be okay.

541
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,695
I met the foster family
that's taking me in.

542
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:04,906
They're nice.

543
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,702
What about Southside High?

544
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:11,871
It's a high school.

545
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:16,835
It's got the jocks,
and the burnouts,
and the nerds... The like.

546
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:20,088
- But I'll survive.
- You just might.

547
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:26,344
Jughead, listen to me.

548
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:29,305
I'm more innocent
than I am guilty,

549
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:31,140
but I've done some...

550
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,935
Some stupid things,
some bad things,

551
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,145
and come what may,

552
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:39,107
I have to answer for my part
of it, you understand?

553
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:41,860
I don't know what's
gonna happen when
this goes to trial,

554
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,487
but you need to be there

555
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:47,073
for your mom, for Jellybean.

556
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,783
They might not need you
right this second...

557
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,577
I'll do my best.

558
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:54,414
Not a doubt in my mind.

559
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,419
Go on.

560
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:08,803
<i>♪ My love, my heart</i>

561
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:12,473
<i>♪ I wanna share it with you</i>

562
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:15,977
<i>♪ When it seems too hard
to bear</i>

563
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,897
<i>♪ I'll be here, I'll be there</i>

564
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,192
<i>♪ I wanna share it with you</i>

565
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:31,034
<i>♪ I wanna share it with you ♪</i>

566
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,383
Good evening,
ladies and gentleman.

567
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:52,764
I'd like to thank Mayor McCoy
for inviting me to speak
on this historic day.

568
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,849
Seventy-five years
of Riverdale...

569
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,775
But what is Riverdale?

570
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:06,778
It's the people, right?

571
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:09,989
You, me, our friends,
our neighbors.

572
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:14,953
Riverdale is Archie Andrews.

573
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,624
Kevin Keller is Riverdale.

574
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:23,086
Veronica Lodge,
she's Riverdale.

575
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,714
But you know who else
is Riverdale?

576
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:29,258
FP Jones,

577
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:33,262
who we were so quick
to blame for Jason's murder.

578
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:38,726
Jughead Jones is Riverdale,

579
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,895
the very soul of Riverdale.

580
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:43,648
Without him,
we may not have ever found out

581
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,316
what happened to Jason.

582
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:48,194
And yet how do we thank him?
By banishing him.

583
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:51,572
Which is what we do
when the truth gets
too ugly in Riverdale.

584
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:54,826
Truth being that Clifford
Blossom was also Riverdale.

585
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:57,036
Riverdale's at a crossroads.

586
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:59,914
If we don't face the reality
of who and what we are,

587
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:03,584
if we keep lying to ourselves
and keeping secrets
from each other,

588
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:06,212
then what happened to Jason
could happen again.

589
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:08,256
Or, God forbid,
something even worse.

590
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,466
Riverdale must do better.

591
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,635
We must do better.

592
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:47,712
Fred.

593
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,673
Have you given any more
thought to my offer?

594
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:53,551
Yes, it is a, uh,
very generous offer.

595
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,012
I'm not selling, Hermione.

596
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:59,515
I... I told you,
it's in your best interest
to get out

597
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:01,184
before Hiram comes back.

598
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:02,852
Is it in your best interests?

599
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:05,229
What's best for the town?
Didn't you hear Betty?

600
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:08,357
Riverdale is at a crossroads,
and I think you are, too.

601
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:12,487
So I will see you at work,
partner.

602
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:24,749
To Archie Andrews,
who saved the cheerleader
and saved the town.

603
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,667
You know what, actually
I think it was Betty's speech.

604
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,629
Here, here to Betty Cooper.

605
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,923
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

606
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,050
<i>We had many
milkshakes that night,</i>

607
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:38,012
<i>and we all felt that as
dangerous as the world
around us had become,</i>

608
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:42,642
<i>here, at least in this booth,
we were safe.</i>

609
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:46,979
Cheryl?

610
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,530
- Cheryl?
- In here, Mother.

611
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,040
What is that smell?

612
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:07,917
Gasoline.

613
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:12,380
It's the only way we can
truly start over, be purified.

614
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:16,634
Oh, God.

615
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:24,267
Wow,
it looks great in here.

616
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:27,228
I cleaned it up after
Sheriff Keller thrashed it.

617
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:28,938
Just in case my dad...

618
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:33,526
Until he gets out,
I'm not giving up on him, Jug.

619
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:35,611
Hell no.

620
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:39,824
That is why I love you, Betty.

621
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:50,293
I love you, Betty Cooper.

622
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:57,258
Jughead Jones.

623
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,595
I love you.

624
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:18,613
What about your mom?

625
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:23,117
At this hour, after mixing
her reds and whites
at the Jubilee,

626
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:27,121
she's no doubt
sleeping soundly in
the arms of Prince Valium.

627
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:30,958
So, come on in,
but keep it quiet, okay?

628
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,424
We've had this day
with each other

629
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:22,343
from the very beginning,
Archiekins.

630
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,737
Oh, my God.

631
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:43,072
Is that your mom?

632
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:44,699
Who else would it be?

633
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,924
Easy, Hot Dog. He's family.

634
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:04,719
Hey.

635
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:07,888
Heard your dad could have
named names but didn't.

636
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:11,726
Serpents take care
of their own.

637
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:15,521
We wanted you to know,
no matter what happens to him,

638
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:19,066
however long he's gone,
we've got your back.

639
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:23,904
This is yours,

640
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:25,906
if you want it.

641
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:46,844
Juggy?

642
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:09,283
Leaving without
saying goodbye?

643
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,452
Didn't know you were
such a scoundrel, Archiekins.

644
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,788
I was trying not to wake you.

645
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:18,084
My dad texted me
asking me to meet
at Pop's for breakfast,

646
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:21,128
which is what we do
when he wants to talk to me
about something serious.

647
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:22,797
- Probably me
staying out all night.

648
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:28,302
I'll call you later.

649
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:40,189
Hey, Casanova. I, uh...
I ordered you the usual.

650
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:42,441
Thanks, Dad. I'm just
gonna go wash my hands.

651
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:58,207
Who's in charge here?
Show me where the safe is!

652
00:40:58,416 --> 00:40:59,542
There is no safe!

653
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,335
You've got a safe.
Show me where it is!

654
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:03,587
- Where's the safe, old man?
- There ain't no safe.

655
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:05,005
Show me
where the safe is!

656
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:28,070
Give me your wallet!

657
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:35,202
<i>Imagine this instant,
frozen in time.</i>

658
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:40,040
<i>People will look back at this
as the exact moment</i>

659
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:43,669
<i>that last bit of Riverdale's
innocence finally died.</i>

660
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:45,546
<i>When darkness won.</i>

661
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:49,341
<i>Marked by an
act of violence,</i>

662
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:54,305
<i>that was anything but random.</i>

663
00:41:54,329 --> 00:42:14,329
