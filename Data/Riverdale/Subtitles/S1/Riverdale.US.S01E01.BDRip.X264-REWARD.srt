1
00:00:03,213 --> 00:00:06,091
<i>Our story is about
a town, a small town,</i>

2
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:08,927
<i>and the people who live
in the town.</i>

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,430
<i>From a distance,
it presents itself</i>

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,767
<i>like so many other small towns
all over the world...</i>

5
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:16,726
<i>Safe.</i>

6
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:17,852
<i>Decent.</i>

7
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:18,979
<i>Innocent.</i>

8
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:21,356
<i>Get closer, though,</i>

9
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:24,985
<i>and you start seeing
the shadows underneath.</i>

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,571
<i>The name of our town
is Riverdale.</i>

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,626
<i>And our story begins, I guess,</i>

12
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:44,087
<i>with what the Blossom twins
did this summer.</i>

13
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,595
<i>On the Fourth of July,
just after dawn,</i>

14
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:55,390
<i>Jason and Cheryl Blossom
drove out to Sweetwater River</i>

15
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:57,350
<i>for an early morning
boat ride.</i>

16
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,561
Are you scared, Jason?

17
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,157
<i>The next thing we
know happened for sure</i>

18
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:13,575
<i>is that Dilton Doiley,</i>

19
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:15,535
<i>who was leading Riverdale's
Boy Scout Troop</i>

20
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:17,287
<i>on a bird watching expedition,</i>

21
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,331
<i>came upon Cheryl
by the river's edge.</i>

22
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,627
Jason...

23
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:37,015
<i>Riverdale Police dragged
Sweetwater River
for Jason's body,</i>

24
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:38,808
<i>but never found it.</i>

25
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:40,268
If he is dead, Hal,

26
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,105
I hope in those last moments
he suffered.

27
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,859
May Jason Blossom
burn in hell.

28
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:51,696
<i>So a week later,</i>

29
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:55,241
<i>the Blossom family buried
an empty casket</i>

30
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,119
<i>and Jason's death
was ruled an accident,</i>

31
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:01,664
<i>as the story that Cheryl told
made the rounds.</i>

32
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:04,918
<i>That Cheryl dropped
a glove in the water,</i>

33
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:07,378
<i>and Jason reached
down to get it,</i>

34
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:09,923
<i>and accidentally
tipped the boat,</i>

35
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,467
<i>and panicked, and drowned.</i>

36
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:17,388
<i>As for us,
we were still talking about
the "July Fourth tragedy"</i>

37
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:19,307
<i>on the last day
of summer vacation,</i>

38
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:22,352
<i>when a new mystery
rolled into town.</i>

39
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,945
Now brace yourself.
The apartment's small,
a <i>pied-à-terre,</i>

40
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,947
- but "quality, always."
- "Quality, always."

41
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,826
Plus, it's the only piece
of property in my name

42
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,285
and not your father's.

43
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:45,667
Ms. Hermione!

44
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,627
- Welcome home!
- Smithers!

45
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:49,754
Oh, you are a sight
for sore eyes.

46
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,632
- How was the ride?
- No traffic, thank God.

47
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,551
Smithers, I'd like
to introduce you

48
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,469
to my daughter, Veronica.

49
00:02:56,928 --> 00:02:59,013
- It's a pleasure, miss.
- Hi.

50
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:00,515
- I'll get the bags.
- Would you?

51
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,351
Oh, and would you like
some menus, ma'am,
so you can order in?

52
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,103
Oh, no.
I have been craving

53
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,021
one of Pop Tate's
cheeseburgers
since noon.

54
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,857
Is his Chock'lit Shoppe
still open?

55
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:12,485
What is a Chock'lit Shoppe
and why does it sell burgers?

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,480
Subtittle By | SupunWe |

57
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,833
Are you excited? Nervous?

58
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:31,254
Both. I haven't seen him
all summer.

59
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,256
Which is why nerves
are acceptable,

60
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,550
but we agreed, Betty...
It's time.

61
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,303
You like him, he likes you.

62
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,388
Well, then why, Kevin,

63
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,307
hasn't he ever said
or done anything?

64
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:45,143
Because Archie's swell,

65
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,103
but like most
millennial straight guys,

66
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:48,354
he needs to be told
what he wants.

67
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:50,315
So tell him, finally.

68
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:51,983
Well, we'll see.
I mean, it depends.

69
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,235
Oh, my God!

70
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:55,695
What?

71
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:59,324
Game-changer.
Archie got hot!

72
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,118
He's got abs now.

73
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:07,248
Six more reasons for you
to take that ginger bull
by the horns tonight.

74
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,375
<i>So, what was the highlight?</i>

75
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:10,919
Of my internship?

76
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,339
The Toni Morrison
book release party
I organized, by far.

77
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:16,257
At the end of the night,
Toni Morrison,

78
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,884
who is, as you know,

79
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,261
- my literary hero,
says to me...
- Yes. Yes.

80
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,639
"Don't rush this time, Betty.

81
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:25,516
"It goes by so fast
at your age.

82
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:27,727
"One summer
can change everything."

83
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:32,190
Wow. That's so true.

84
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,524
How was working for your dad?

85
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,277
It was...
Pouring concrete,

86
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:38,321
every day, all day long.

87
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:42,408
To pass time,
I would start composing

88
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,993
these poems, in my head.

89
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:45,370
And at night, I'd go home,
I'd write them down...

90
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:46,871
You don't even
like reading poetry.

91
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,416
They weren't poems,
they were song lyrics.

92
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,379
And working on them
made me feel like...

93
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:56,965
What, Archie?

94
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:58,216
It made me feel like

95
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,551
I'd finally broken through
to something real.

96
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:02,637
About my life

97
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,222
and what I should be trying
to do with it.

98
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,224
Music.

99
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,643
Starting this year, tomorrow.

100
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:10,353
Amazing.

101
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,773
Will you ask Ms. Grundy
to tutor you?

102
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,608
- I'm not sure, maybe.
- What about football?

103
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,527
- Can you do both?
- I'll try out, at least.

104
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,362
- Well, have you told your dad?
- No.

105
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:20,947
Until I've got things
more figured out,

106
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,657
you're the only person
I'm telling, okay?

107
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,452
Well, I'd love to hear
them sometime.

108
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:28,121
Your songs.

109
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,205
- Yeah?
- Yes.

110
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:31,040
Yeah, I'm finishing
a couple of demos tonight.

111
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,584
Great. Also...

112
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:36,170
I've been thinking

113
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,589
about us, Archie,

114
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,677
and our friendship,
and how it's time we...

115
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:59,736
I called in an order,
for Lodge?

116
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,112
Two burgers,
yeah, almost ready,

117
00:06:01,321 --> 00:06:02,363
but you gotta wait.

118
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,491
- Hi.
- Hey.

119
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,202
How are the onion rings here?

120
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,662
So good.

121
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,497
Can we get some onion rings,
too, please?

122
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:13,166
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

123
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,209
My mom and I
just moved here, so...

124
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,961
- From where?
- New York.

125
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,129
Wow.

126
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,132
Do you guys go to Riverdale?

127
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:23,176
- We do. Both of us. Together.
- We're sophomores.

128
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:24,552
Me too.

129
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:27,513
- I'm filled with dread.
- Why is that?

130
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:30,475
Are you familiar with the
works of Truman Capote?

131
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,977
I'm <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's,</i>

132
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:34,896
but this place is strictly <i>In Cold Blood.</i>

133
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,233
Veronica Lodge.

134
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,526
Archie Andrews.

135
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:43,154
Uh, this is Betty Cooper.

136
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,157
Wait, are you...

137
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:49,035
Supposed to give you
your tour tomorrow? Yes.

138
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:51,329
I'm your peer mentor.

139
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,747
Do you want to join us?

140
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,832
Hey, maybe we can
un-fill you with dread.

141
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,584
My mom's waiting for me.

142
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:59,170
But, to be continued.

143
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:00,296
Yeah.

144
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,219
- What were you saying?
- Nothing.

145
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,974
Hey, Dad. First day of school
and I'm already late.

146
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:13,851
Hey, Vegas.

147
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,772
Hey, you, uh,
you stopping by
the site later?

148
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:19,440
Dad, it's my first day.

149
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,109
Oh, we got to get you going
in the office,

150
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,902
so next summer
you're not on the crew.

151
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:25,988
Well, I can't.
I've got football tryouts.

152
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,242
Or is that not okay?

153
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,787
No, it's, uh...
It's okay. Good luck.

154
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:36,624
Hmm.

155
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,379
Betty.
This coming year
is critical for colleges.

156
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:42,880
Grades are important,

157
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:44,882
extracurriculars, athletics.

158
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,968
Maintaining
a decent character

159
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:49,554
is hugely important,
they do look at that.

160
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,013
Mom, I'm a sophomore.

161
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:53,057
You've accomplished so much,

162
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,518
I don't want anything
jeopardizing that.

163
00:07:57,228 --> 00:07:59,147
I mean, just think
of your poor sister.

164
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,315
She was such a shining star

165
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:02,900
before she let
that Blossom boy ruin her.

166
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:04,444
Mom, I'm not Polly.

167
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,529
You missed curfew last night.

168
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,239
By seven minutes.

169
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:10,575
I was with Archie,
who has red hair, yes,

170
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:13,119
but is nothing
like Jason Blossom.

171
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,330
Oh, but sweetie, all boys
are like Jason Blossom.

172
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,876
I love you so much,
Elizabeth.

173
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:23,921
I just need you
to be smart, okay?

174
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,341
And stay...

175
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,177
Focused.

176
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:31,846
I refilled your Adderall.

177
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,558
Seems you forgot
to pick up your prescription.

178
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:52,325
Bro, you are ready
for football.

179
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,993
I'm not kidding you, dude.
You got ripped.

180
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:55,745
Dude, you're a beast.
Look at this arm, it's diesel!

181
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,788
How much are you benching,
like 220? 225?

182
00:08:57,997 --> 00:08:59,207
You got to give me
some tips, man.

183
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,501
Romanian deadlifts, right?
Taking some T?

184
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,377
Ginseng?

185
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:04,962
Maca root?

186
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,131
<i>Tribulus terrestris?</i>

187
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,633
It's from working
construction, Reg.

188
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,426
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
Yo, Moose.

189
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,637
- Look who grew up
over the summer.
Hey!

190
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:13,971
Yo,
be honest with me.

191
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,432
You work on any houses?
Any private homes?

192
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:17,683
Yeah, a couple.

193
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:20,561
Did you tap some cougar ass
this summer?

194
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,313
You know what,
I think that's more a fantasy

195
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:24,148
from your wank-bank, Reggie.

196
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:26,442
- I'll catch you guys soon.
- Peace out, brother.

197
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:28,611
- Totally did it, bro.
- He totally did it.

198
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,280
So, I usually start off
my tours

199
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:33,908
with a little history
and context.

200
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,786
Riverdale High first opened
its doors in 1941 and...

201
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,455
And hasn't been redecorated
since, apparently.

202
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:41,541
Honestly, I feel
like I'm wandering

203
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,668
through the lost epilogue
of <i>Our Town.</i>

204
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:45,586
Uh-huh.

205
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:47,880
So what's the social scene
like here? Any night clubs?

206
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:50,049
A strip club
called the Ho Zone

207
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:52,426
and a tragic gay bar
called Innuendo.

208
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:53,719
Friday nights, football games

209
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,846
and then tailgate parties
at the Mallmart parking lot.

210
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,557
Saturday night is movie night,

211
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:58,724
regardless of what's playing
at the Bijou,

212
00:09:58,933 --> 00:09:59,809
and you better
get there early,

213
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,519
because we don't have
reserved seating in Riverdale.

214
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:05,231
And Sunday nights...
Thank God for HBO.

215
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,149
Veronica Lodge, Kevin Keller.

216
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,819
- Veronica's new here.
Kevin is...
- ...gay, thank God.

217
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,195
Let's be best friends.

218
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:12,822
Is it true what they say
about your dad?

219
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,867
That he's the devil incarnate?

220
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,328
I stand by my father.

221
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:21,539
Does everyone here know?

222
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,211
Wonderful. Ten minutes in
and I'm already

223
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,838
the <i>Blue Jasmine</i>
of Riverdale High.

224
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:30,756
What?

225
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:52,653
Mm-mm.

226
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:55,656
Excuse me,
this is a closed rehearsal.

227
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,074
I'm sorry, I...

228
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,493
Josie, right?

229
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:01,704
I was hoping
I could talk to you

230
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,122
about some songs that I wrote?

231
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,207
Let me just
stop you right there.

232
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,752
You're staring
at our pussycat ears,

233
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,086
which is rude,

234
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:12,298
but let me break it,
and them, down for you.

235
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,759
The Pussycats
are building a brand,

236
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,679
creating a signature look,
okay? We're telling a story.

237
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:22,266
Last year, we won
Rockland County's
Battle of the Bands.

238
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:23,392
That we did.

239
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:26,896
This year, we'd like to build
on that success,

240
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,440
continue telling our story

241
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,901
with songs we write.

242
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,153
I get that. It's just...

243
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:36,781
Read my glossed lips,

244
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,366
Justin Gingerlake.

245
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,076
Not...

246
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:41,619
Gonna...

247
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:43,162
Happen.

248
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,625
Oh, and of course there's
the Back-to-School

249
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,293
- semiformal dance
this weekend.
- Oh!

250
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,253
There's the hottie
we were with last night.

251
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,923
The red-headed Ansel Elgort.

252
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,383
Is he your boyfriend?

253
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,259
- No, he's straight.
- No, we're just friends.

254
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,971
In that case,
mind putting in a word?

255
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,057
I've tried every flavor of boy
but orange.

256
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,850
Actually, to clarify...

257
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,686
Betty and Archie
aren't dating,

258
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,312
but they are endgame.

259
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,357
You should ask him
to the semiformal then.

260
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,901
She should, but I heard
it might be getting canceled.

261
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:15,403
Because of what happened
to Jason.

262
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,446
They're gonna tell us
at the assembly.

263
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,657
Who's Jason
and what happened to him?

264
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:22,660
<i>Thank you
for that moment of silence.</i>

265
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,328
<i>Many of you were lucky enough</i>

266
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:26,664
<i>to have known
my brother personally.</i>

267
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:30,710
<i>Each and every one of you
meant the world to Jason.</i>

268
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,586
<i>I loved my brother.</i>

269
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,589
<i>He was and always will be
my soulmate.</i>

270
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:37,591
<i>So I speak with the confidence</i>

271
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,593
<i>only a twin could have...</i>

272
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:42,972
<i>Jason wouldn't want us
to spend the year mourning.</i>

273
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:47,810
<i>Jason would want us
to move on with our lives.</i>

274
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,395
<i>Which is why I've asked
the School Board</i>

275
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,480
<i>not to cancel
the Back-to-School semiformal.</i>

276
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,316
<i>But rather, to let us use it</i>

277
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,153
<i>as a way
to heal, collectively,</i>

278
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,990
<i>and celebrate my brother's
too, too short life
on this mortal coil.</i>

279
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:03,367
<i>Thank you all.</i>

280
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,834
- Ms. Grundy? Hey.
- Archie.

281
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,587
What are you doing
walking in this heat?

282
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,547
Um... Building character?

283
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,259
Do you want a ride?

284
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,666
Ms. Grundy. Ms. Grundy.

285
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:55,878
Geraldine.

286
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,882
What can I do for you,
Mr. Andrews?

287
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,885
Can we talk,
Ms. Grundy, please?

288
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:06,096
It depends. About what?

289
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,016
Music.

290
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,519
You're the music teacher.
Can we talk about music?

291
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:12,937
Of course.

292
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,189
Make an appointment.

293
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:18,609
During my office hours,
my official office hours.

294
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,536
Hermione Lodge.

295
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,499
Well, my day just got
a lot more interesting.

296
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:34,500
Hello, Fred.

297
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:36,168
How are you?

298
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:37,711
Surprised.

299
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,715
Can I get you anything?
Would you like a water?

300
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:42,675
A job.

301
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:45,427
I saw on your website

302
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,388
that you are looking
for a seasonal hire,

303
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,682
someone to help
with the books?

304
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,393
Yeah, my guy's
on paternity leave.

305
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,020
You know, I think
my daughter's going to school

306
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:58,357
with your son,
isn't that funny?

307
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,776
We'll have to tell them
that we knew each other,

308
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,112
that we even dated,
for a little while...

309
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:06,448
- Well, at least until I...
- ...chose the rich kid.

310
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,784
And now,
a reversal of fortune.

311
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:12,663
How's Mary doing?

312
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,665
She's in Chicago.

313
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,084
We split up. We're civil.

314
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:18,627
How about you?

315
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,547
How are you
holding up? Really?

316
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:25,092
I have a little money saved.

317
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,804
I was praying that someone
in Riverdale,

318
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:31,557
maybe an old friend,

319
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,101
would be willing to give me
the benefit of the doubt.

320
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,562
If it were up to me.

321
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,481
Isn't it up to you?
It's your company.

322
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,735
Well, I have clients.

323
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,987
I can't very well
have Hermione Lodge,

324
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,530
the wife of Hiram Lodge,

325
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,407
on trial for fraud
and embezzlement,

326
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:50,367
balancing my books.

327
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:51,911
Can I?

328
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,913
No.

329
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,291
I suppose you can't.

330
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,229
Can I join?

331
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:20,981
Yeah.

332
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,233
What are we doing?

333
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,860
Listening to one
of Archie's songs.

334
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,528
I thought we were going
to have to pretend

335
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,239
to like it, but it's actually
really good.

336
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,367
Wait, that was you singing?

337
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,452
- Something you wrote?
- It's rough.

338
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:34,745
No, it's great.

339
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:37,289
It's incredible, actually,
the little snippet I heard.

340
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,708
Is that your thing? Music?

341
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,543
Are you doing something
with that?

342
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,295
Yeah, that's the plan.

343
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:45,464
So how's your
first day going? Good?

344
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,841
Not to be
a complete narcissist,

345
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,426
but I thought people
would be more...

346
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:50,719
Obsessed with you?

347
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:53,305
Any other year,
you'd be trending number one,
for sure.

348
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,265
This year, though,
it's all about Cheryl

349
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,226
trying to win
the Best Supporting Psycho
Oscar

350
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,354
for her role
as Riverdale High's
bereaved Red Widow.

351
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,147
Hey, I should go.
I got that meeting with Grundy

352
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,565
and then football tryouts, so.

353
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,360
You play football, too?
What don't you do?

354
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:09,446
Before you ask,
Blue Jasmine, no,

355
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:10,864
she has not invited him
to the dance yet...

356
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,449
Not yet, and don't
talk about Archie.

357
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,285
Veronica Lodge,
I'd heard whisperings.

358
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,080
I'm Cheryl Blossom, may I sit?

359
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,248
Betty, would you mind?

360
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,379
So, what are you three hens
gossiping about?

361
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,465
Archie's Efron-esque emergence
from the chrysalis of puberty?

362
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,302
Extracurriculars.

363
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:33,887
Weatherbee wants me
to sign up for a few.

364
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,557
Cheerleading. You must.

365
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,434
I'm senior captain
of the River Vixens.

366
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:40,602
Is cheerleading still a thing?

367
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,730
Is being the Gay Best Friend
still a thing?

368
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:48,068
Some people say it's retro,
I say it's eternal and iconic.

369
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,654
At Spence, I sat at the top
of the Elites' pyramid.

370
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:51,655
I'm in.

371
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,657
Betty, you're trying out, too.

372
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,994
Of course,
anyone's welcome to try out,

373
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,746
but Betty's already
got so much

374
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,330
on her plate right now

375
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,416
and being a Vixen
is kind of a full-time thing.

376
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,376
But open to all!

377
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,254
Follow me on Twitter
and I'll do the same.

378
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:09,923
My handle is @cherylbombshell.

379
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,595
Okay. Go ahead and hate
on cheerleading,

380
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:15,929
but if Hipster Prince Harry...

381
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,598
I'd love to be a cheerleader.

382
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,185
It would look great
on my college applications.

383
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,395
But last year,
when I tried out,

384
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,022
Cheryl said I was too fat.

385
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,565
"Too season 5 Betty Draper."

386
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:28,108
It was a great line,

387
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,152
but not at all true.

388
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,405
Well, you're a total
smoke show now.

389
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:34,656
I mean it.

390
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,743
As hot and as smart
as you are,

391
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,537
you should be the
Queen Bey of this drab hive.

392
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,999
Look, if you want
to be a River Vixen,

393
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,085
I'll help you prep.
I have moves.

394
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,049
Okay. You know what?
Show me your moves.

395
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,477
They're...

396
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:05,687
Very real,

397
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,065
very personal.

398
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,900
I took your advice
and wrote them down.

399
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:11,235
Polished them.

400
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,821
But I was wondering maybe
if you could help me...

401
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,157
With what, Archie?

402
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:18,492
You went to Juilliard,
Ms. Grundy.

403
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,285
There is no one else
in Riverdale
I can take lessons from.

404
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:21,703
Believe me, I've looked.

405
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,747
Well, I don't think
that's a good idea.

406
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,669
I don't think we should
be alone together.

407
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,592
If this is you trying
to restart something

408
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,095
that never should've
started in the first...

409
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,140
No, it's not.
It is about the music.

410
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,644
But it's also...

411
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:49,857
Come on,
I need to be able

412
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,483
to talk about what happened
with someone.

413
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,235
We heard what we heard

414
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,695
and afterwards,
we didn't do anything.

415
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,572
We didn't say anything.

416
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,832
We heard fireworks.

417
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,501
Who's lighting fireworks
at 6:00 in the morning?

418
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,629
How would we explain
why we were together

419
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:15,132
at Sweetwater River
at 6:00 a.m.
on the Fourth of July?

420
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,259
And you're right.

421
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,262
We didn't say anything.

422
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,933
We're both going to have to
live with that choice.

423
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,061
Do you understand?

424
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,857
I think you should
pursue your music,

425
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,359
but not with me.

426
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,996
We're dynamite!

427
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:48,165
We'll take you down,

428
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,417
and fight the fight!

429
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,586
Whoo! Go, Bulldogs!

430
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,755
Hmm.

431
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,674
Ladies, where's the heat?
Where's the sizzle?

432
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,969
Well, you haven't seen
our big finish yet.

433
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,555
Don't freak out.
Just trust me.

434
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,405
Check your
sell-by date, ladies,

435
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:24,201
faux lesbian kissing
hasn't been taboo since 1994.

436
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,454
So let's see if you do better
with the interview portion
of our audition.

437
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,915
Betty,
how's your sister doing?

438
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,086
Um, Polly's fine,
thanks for asking.

439
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,255
Veronica, has Betty told you
about her sister yet?

440
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,715
- Uh, no.
- Go ahead, Betty.

441
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:41,927
Tell Veronica
about your sister
and my dear brother.

442
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,053
Polly and Jason dated.

443
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:44,763
I wouldn't say "dated".

444
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,891
- It didn't end well.
- In fact,

445
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,019
Jason's probably why
your sister had
a nervous breakdown

446
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:53,522
and now lives in a group home,
isn't it?

447
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,731
That's what my parents think.

448
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,150
What do you have to say
about that, Betty?

449
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,361
Go ahead, the floor is yours.

450
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,488
Whatever you've been dying
to spew about Jason

451
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:04,199
and how he treated Polly,
unleash it.

452
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,660
Destroy me. Tear me a new one.

453
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,662
Rip me to shreds.
Annihilate me.

454
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,830
I just...

455
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,082
Finally.

456
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,922
I just wanted
to say I'm sorry

457
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,384
about what happened to Jason.

458
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,636
I can't even imagine
what you and your family

459
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:25,846
must be going through.

460
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:28,807
Right.

461
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,936
Veronica,
welcome to the River Vixens.

462
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:36,064
Betty, better luck next time.

463
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:41,069
Wait, what? Why?

464
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,989
Because you couldn't bully
Betty into being a bitch?

465
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,283
I need girls with fire
on my squad.

466
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,162
I know what you need, Cheryl,

467
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,997
because I know who you are.

468
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,625
You would rather
people fear
than like you,

469
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,961
so you traffic
in terror and intimidation.

470
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,298
You're rich, so you've never
been held accountable,

471
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,175
but I'm living proof.

472
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:06,136
That certainty,
that entitlement

473
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:07,763
you wear on your head
like a crown?

474
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,765
It won't last.

475
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,768
Eventually, there will be
a reckoning.

476
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:15,729
Or...

477
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,608
Maybe that reckoning
is now.

478
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,277
And maybe, that reckoning...

479
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:24,821
Is me.

480
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:28,200
Betty and I come
as a matching set.

481
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,160
You want one,
you take us both.

482
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,287
You wanted fire?

483
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:36,625
Sorry, Cherylbombshell,
my specialty's ice.

484
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:42,255
Go, get around him.
Get around him.

485
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,008
Let's move.

486
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:46,510
Andrews!

487
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,391
There we go. Looking good.

488
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,853
- What's up, Coach?
- Here.

489
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,237
- This is Jason's number.
- It's yours now.

490
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,364
Usually, sophomores,
they only play JV.

491
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:09,574
This year, we've got
an open spot in varsity.

492
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,536
From what you've
been showing us,
well, I want you to fill it.

493
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:16,081
Varsity's got
longer practices.

494
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,374
More away games.

495
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:18,917
Yeah, bigger commitment, yeah.

496
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:20,794
Well, I need to think
about it, Coach. I...

497
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,879
Oh, what, you got
something better to do?

498
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,633
My dad's company.

499
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:28,135
It's our family business,

500
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,219
and he's sort of counting
on me to help out

501
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:30,512
after school, on weekends...

502
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,513
Hold up, Jackson,
hold the ball.

503
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,724
You know what,
why don't you sleep on it.

504
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:36,726
Let's go. Bring it in, guys.
Come on.

505
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,530
Perfect.

506
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,907
Very Betty Draper, season 1.

507
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:57,372
Veronica.

508
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,710
Why did...
Why did you defend me?

509
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:06,381
I know the crowd
you ran with
in New York.

510
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:10,802
Why are you being so... Nice?

511
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,930
When my father got arrested,

512
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,933
it was the worst thing ever.

513
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:20,437
All these trolls
started writing

514
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,105
horrible things about us.

515
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,609
We'd get letters and e-mails
saying that

516
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:27,611
my dad was a thief,

517
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:30,238
my mom
was a clueless socialite,

518
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:34,075
and that I was
the spoiled rich-bitch
ice princess.

519
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:38,205
And what hurt the most
about it was...

520
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:42,626
The things the trolls
were writing were true.

521
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,796
I was like Cheryl.
I was worse than Cheryl.

522
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:51,301
So, when my mom said
we were moving to Riverdale,

523
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,220
I made a pact with myself

524
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:58,183
to use this
as an opportunity
to become

525
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:02,145
maybe, hopefully,
a better version of myself.

526
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,106
That's a lot of pressure.

527
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:12,072
When Polly and Jason
got together...

528
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:15,116
It meant everything to her

529
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,826
and nothing to him,

530
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,789
and...

531
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:24,751
And things got super
intense and weird and toxic

532
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,753
and my mom turned on Polly.

533
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,006
Said Polly wasn't
her daughter anymore,

534
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,300
said all these
awful things to her.

535
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,011
Jason hurt Polly,

536
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:39,599
but it's my mom who broke her.

537
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,856
Archie.

538
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,733
- You're so doing this.
- What?

539
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,735
Slaying your dragons,
Betty Cooper, one by one.

540
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:55,448
- Hi, Teen Outlander.
- Hey.

541
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,367
Nice outfits.

542
00:26:57,576 --> 00:27:00,912
Betty here has something
she wants to ask you

543
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,289
about the
Back-to-School dance.

544
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,208
Go on, Betty, ask.

545
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:10,422
I was wondering
if you wanted
to come

546
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,383
with both of us.

547
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:14,843
- Huh?
- What?

548
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,305
It's your first dance
at Riverdale.

549
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:19,598
You should have
someone to go with,

550
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,391
even if it's just a friend.

551
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:25,520
I mean, I'd love to.

552
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:28,231
I'm not really in the
headspace for a dance.

553
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,442
Oh. That's okay.

554
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:35,280
Totally unacceptable,
Archiekins.
We need an escort.

555
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,450
Take a break from being
a tortured musical genius

556
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,410
and come spend
a blissful evening

557
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,706
with not one, but two
newly-minted River Vixens.

558
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,416
We'll text you time and place.

559
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,420
Okay. Yeah, okay.

560
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,088
- Bye.
- Bye.

561
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,109
What is that?

562
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,447
I made the cheerleading squad.

563
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,492
Cheryl Blossom's
cheerleading squad?

564
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,120
After what Jason did to Polly?

565
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:27,290
No, I'm sorry.
I won't allow it.

566
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,668
Take that off right now.

567
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:34,047
- No.
- What did you say to me?

568
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,759
I do everything for everyone.

569
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,470
Everything to be perfect.

570
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:44,140
The perfect daughter,
the perfect sister,
the perfect student...

571
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:47,519
Can't I do this one thing
just for me?

572
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:48,645
- Wait.
- Get out of my way.

573
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:50,271
- Where are you going?
- To buy a dress.

574
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:52,565
Because guess what?

575
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,735
I'm also gong to the dance
with Archie.

576
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,905
And Veronica.

577
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,782
Wait. Hermione Lodge's
daughter?

578
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,034
She's actually really nice.

579
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,577
And trying
to be a good person.

580
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:05,954
You think so?

581
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:07,706
You think she's going to be
your friend?

582
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:09,958
Let me tell you something.

583
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,711
Girls like Cheryl
and Veronica Lodge,

584
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,087
they don't like girls like us.

585
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:15,755
I don't want to hear it, Mom.

586
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,842
It's happening. I'm going.

587
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,012
Thank you, Smithers.

588
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:24,764
As always, you're a godsend.

589
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,725
Happy to help, Ms. Hermione.

590
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,393
Unlike the rest of Riverdale.

591
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:30,687
- Hmm.
- What's that?

592
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,731
Oh. Um...

593
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:35,400
A spot of good news.
The car service

594
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,902
found and dropped off
your missing bag.

595
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,489
Missing bag?

596
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:54,544
Oh, Hiram...
What have you done?

597
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:13,897
I, um... I got a call
from your coach today.

598
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:15,440
He's under the impression

599
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,192
that you can't play
varsity football

600
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,569
because I'm making you
work for me.

601
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:22,238
Which is odd,
because you made it
seem like

602
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:23,531
you couldn't work for me

603
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,949
because you were
playing football.

604
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:27,452
So my first question is...

605
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,914
Who are you lying to?

606
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,082
Me or your coach?

607
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:36,836
Neither.

608
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,299
Both.

609
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,972
Dad...

610
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,643
I want to study music,

611
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,853
I want to write music.

612
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,272
Football takes you to college.

613
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:58,149
College takes you
to business school.

614
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,401
- Business school...
- Takes me back here.

615
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,237
To work for you in Riverdale.

616
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:04,614
Not for me, with me.

617
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,076
And eventually
for yourself, son.

618
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,119
The company would be yours.

619
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:13,706
No disrespect, Dad,

620
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:18,419
but I don't want it.

621
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:21,673
Three months ago, you did.

622
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:24,551
What happened?

623
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:29,472
I've changed.
Everything's changed.

624
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:31,140
This summer...

625
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:33,476
This summer what?

626
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:39,816
That's it?

627
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,360
We don't talk anymore?

628
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,197
Dad.

629
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:49,075
I would never force you
to play football.

630
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:52,453
I don't care
if you play football.

631
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:57,292
And you don't have to work
with me or for me, ever again.

632
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,004
But some advice, man-to-man?

633
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:03,548
These decisions
that you're making now, son,

634
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:05,842
they have consequences.

635
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,218
They go on to form who you are

636
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,095
and who you'll become.

637
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,930
Whatever you decide,

638
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:15,268
be confident enough in it
that you don't have to lie.

639
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,253
Well, it's not the Met Ball.

640
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:47,300
Hey. When do you have
to let Coach Clayton

641
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:49,385
- know about football?
- This weekend.

642
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:52,305
Guys, can't we just
liberate ourselves

643
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:55,475
from the tired dichotomy
of jock/artist?

644
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:58,478
Can't we, in this post
James Franco world,

645
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,772
be all things at once?

646
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,440
I've been working
on it, Veronica.

647
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:07,236
Work faster.
I'm getting punch.

648
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:08,905
You got this.

649
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:13,409
It's about following
your heart, right?

650
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:18,706
What does your heart say?
Music or football?

651
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,001
Betty, will you give me
one minute?

652
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,169
And I promise,
when I get back,

653
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:24,754
I'll be a much
better date, okay?

654
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:26,172
I have a plan.

655
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:31,177
Betty, you will not believe
who just propositioned me

656
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,012
in the bathroom.
Give you a hint...

657
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:34,597
His name may be Moose,

658
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,516
but I'd describe
a certain appendage of his

659
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,226
as horse-like.

660
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:46,693
Don't panic,
I'm not stalking you.

661
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:51,489
Archie, didn't we
have a deal?

662
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,493
No, Geraldine,
we have a secret,

663
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,204
Multiple secrets, actually.

664
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:00,623
And maybe we could've
done something
to help Jason that morning,

665
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,916
or maybe we couldn't have.

666
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,669
And I won't tell
anyone anything,

667
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,337
but you need to help me.

668
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,756
This summer, the only thing
that kept me sane

669
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:10,008
was writing these songs.

670
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:13,636
So here's my
not-so-indecent proposal.

671
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,097
I want to do
an independent study with you,

672
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:18,266
as many mornings a week
as you can spare, and I swear

673
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:19,767
that's all it'll be.

674
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:23,021
And I won't tell anyone
about July Fourth, ever.

675
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,064
Deal?

676
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:32,363
Monday, Wednesday,
Friday, 7:30 a.m.,
before first period.

677
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,240
I'll set it up

678
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,409
and see about getting
you credit.

679
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,880
<i>Good evening, friends.</i>

680
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:50,590
<i>Are you all having
a good time?</i>

681
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:57,597
<i>As honorary chairperson
and de facto queen</i>

682
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:58,890
<i>of tonight's semiformal,</i>

683
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,183
<i>it is my great pleasure</i>

684
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:02,268
<i>to introduce this evening's
main entertainment.</i>

685
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:05,104
<i>To know them
is to be obsessed with them.</i>

686
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:07,273
<i>Though they usually perform
their own material,</i>

687
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:08,775
<i>tonight, they're making
an exception</i>

688
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,444
<i>and debuting a cover
of the song my parents claim
they were listening to</i>

689
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,237
<i>the night Jason and I
were conceived.</i>

690
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:15,656
<i>This one's for you, JJ.</i>

691
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:19,368
- Sorry about that.
<i>- I give you
Josie and the Pussycats.</i>

692
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,339
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

693
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:35,593
Did that go okay?

694
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,097
Yeah, yes. I'll study
with Ms. Grundy
before school,

695
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,932
football practice
after school,

696
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,558
and work with my dad
on the weekends.

697
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:43,726
It's going to be nuts.

698
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:46,104
So long as you don't give up
your passion.

699
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:02,954
Um...

700
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,666
Now that I'm a River Vixen

701
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:10,336
and you're gonna be
on varsity football,

702
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:14,298
I have this fantasy of us
as a power couple...

703
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,176
Or maybe even just
a couple.

704
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,053
Betty...

705
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:22,473
Is that so impossible
to imagine?

706
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,116
Make sure those two
turtledoves
come to my after-party.

707
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:41,617
Veronica too.

708
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:43,953
I'm in the mood
for chaos.

709
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:52,545
It's game time at
Chez Blossom, kiddies.

710
00:36:53,171 --> 00:36:54,922
We're going
old-school tonight.

711
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:56,591
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

712
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:59,177
Who wants to tryst
in the Closet of Love first?

713
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:00,970
My vote is "A" for Archie.

714
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:03,556
Anyone care to second it?

715
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:06,517
- Wait, actually...
- Yes, Andrews! Yes.

716
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:09,061
All right. Gather round, kids.

717
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:11,898
Let's see who's riding
the ginger stallion tonight.

718
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:25,328
Oh, no way!

719
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:28,831
It's clearly pointing to...
The new girl.

720
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,999
This should be fun.

721
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,710
Um... I'm not doing this.

722
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:34,003
That's up to you.

723
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:36,005
But, if you don't,

724
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:38,633
house rules decree
the hostess
gets to take your turn.

725
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:50,895
I know her brother died
and everything,

726
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,188
but...

727
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,316
Cheryl Blossom
truly is the antichrist.

728
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,199
So, uh, do you miss New York?

729
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,619
It's been less than a week.

730
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,622
But... Yes.

731
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,293
Six minutes, twenty seconds.

732
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:16,921
Okay. Your turn.

733
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,423
Ask me a deep,
probing question

734
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:21,092
to kill time.

735
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:26,722
It looked like you and Betty
were having fun at the dance.

736
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:29,809
Definitely. We've been
friends forever.

737
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:32,061
- My turn.
- I didn't ask my question yet.

738
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:35,314
Is that all it is?

739
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,275
Just friends?

740
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:40,486
We're not just friends,
we're best friends.

741
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:46,200
My turn. Did you have
a boyfriend in New York?

742
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:48,995
No.

743
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:50,621
My turn.

744
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:54,041
Could it ever possibly
become something more?

745
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,127
Are you asking for Betty
or for yourself?

746
00:38:56,377 --> 00:39:00,214
For Betty, and you didn't
answer my question.

747
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:03,092
I have never felt...
Whatever it is

748
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:04,802
I'm supposed to feel

749
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,387
with Betty.

750
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:08,389
Have you felt it, though?

751
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:11,392
With anyone?

752
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,601
Yeah.

753
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:16,731
This summer.

754
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:20,693
- Have you?
- Maybe once.

755
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:27,700
You're a little more dangerous
than you look, aren't you?

756
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:31,329
All boy-next-door-ish?

757
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:34,707
You have no idea.

758
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:39,211
Your turn.

759
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:46,052
Ask me a question, Archie.

760
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:51,474
Ask me anything you want.

761
00:39:58,356 --> 00:39:59,732
We shouldn't do this.

762
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:01,734
We definitely shouldn't
do this.

763
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:16,665
Nailed it.

764
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:17,875
Yes.

765
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,253
Where's Betty?

766
00:40:21,754 --> 00:40:23,172
She spiraled and fled.

767
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:25,674
Between us, she's a lot more
high-strung than she looks.

768
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,510
You shady bitch.

769
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,598
Crap. Betty's cell is off.

770
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:33,974
- I'm getting an Uber.
- Can I come with you?

771
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:35,309
We should probably
try to find her.

772
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:36,977
Believe me.
The last thing
Betty wants

773
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:38,813
is us tracking
her down together.

774
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,315
We messed up.

775
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:54,954
Hey, you're home early.
How was the dance?

776
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:57,665
It was fine.

777
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:00,543
I mean, it's not the Met Ball
or anything...

778
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:03,462
Tell me about it.
You can cheer me up.

779
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:05,881
I'm super tired, Mom.

780
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:12,763
Is everything okay?

781
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:17,518
Ronnie, what is it?

782
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:28,946
<i>It was midnight,
when my old friend
Archie Andrews</i>

783
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:31,866
<i>arrived at the one place
in town that was still open.</i>

784
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,910
<i>He was looking
for the girl next door.</i>

785
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,248
<i>Instead, he found me.</i>

786
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:45,379
Hey, Pop. Betty hasn't come
in tonight, has she?

787
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:49,008
Nope.
Just the night hawks
in tonight.

788
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:51,552
Thanks.

789
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:00,811
Uh, can I sit, Jughead?

790
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,396
If you want.

791
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:07,818
- What are you working on?
- My novel.

792
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,946
It's about this summer,
and Jason Blossom.

793
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:13,365
Seventeen years old
and how will he be remembered?

794
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:16,744
As captain
of the water polo team?

795
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:18,078
The Aquaholics?

796
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:21,916
Considering how he died,
probably not.

797
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:23,709
No, what I mean is...

798
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:28,339
Was he doing everything
he was supposed to do,

799
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:31,425
everything he wanted.
I mean, did he even know
what that was?

800
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:38,432
Coach Clayton was in here
talking to Pop Tate.

801
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:39,892
Varsity.

802
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:44,563
Does that make you, what,
Mr. Popular Football God now?

803
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:46,065
No.

804
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:49,693
In fact, I'm kind of terrified

805
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:51,195
I lost my
best friend tonight.

806
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:52,863
If you mean Betty,

807
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,824
whatever happened,
just talk to her.

808
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:58,452
You know,
it'd go a long way.

809
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,583
Would've gone a long way
with me.

810
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:37,283
I'm not going to ask
what you did

811
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:38,951
with Veronica at Cheryl's.

812
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:44,331
But I'm asking you now,
right now,

813
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,083
if you love me, Archie.

814
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:50,087
Or even like me?

815
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:52,214
Of course I love you, Betty.

816
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:57,386
But I can't give you
the answer you want.

817
00:43:58,304 --> 00:43:59,471
Why?

818
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,185
You are so perfect.

819
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,981
I've never been
good enough for you.

820
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:12,359
I'll never be
good enough for you.

821
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:35,299
<i>And so,
it wasn't one heart
that broke that night.</i>

822
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:36,925
<i>It was two.</i>

823
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:41,513
<i>And the night was far
from over.</i>

824
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:49,146
For the record, I'm not gay.

825
00:44:49,355 --> 00:44:52,024
Obviously not, Moose.
You're on the football team.

826
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:54,568
But if you were gay,
what would you like to do?

827
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:57,446
Everything but kiss.

828
00:44:57,655 --> 00:44:59,448
I love a good closet case.

829
00:44:59,657 --> 00:45:02,409
So, let's start with
skinny-dipping

830
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:04,495
and then see what happens?

831
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,623
Dude, are you okay?

832
00:45:24,348 --> 00:45:25,933
Oh, my God, it's Jason.

833
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:27,643
He was shot.

834
00:45:29,395 --> 00:45:32,898
<i>By morning,
everyone would be
talking, texting,</i>

835
00:45:33,107 --> 00:45:34,733
<i>and posting about it.</i>

836
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:36,443
<i>We'd all be feeling it.</i>

837
00:45:37,361 --> 00:45:41,448
<i>That the world around us
had changed,
maybe forever.</i>

838
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:45,327
<i>That Riverdale wasn't
the same town
as before.</i>

839
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:49,415
<i>That it was a town
of shadows and secrets now.</i>

840
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:53,127
<i>On Monday,
the autopsy on Jason's body</i>

841
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:54,795
<i>would take place.</i>

842
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:58,424
<i>And on Tuesday,
halfway through fifth period,</i>

843
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:01,176
<i>the first arrest
would be made.</i>

844
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:21,160
