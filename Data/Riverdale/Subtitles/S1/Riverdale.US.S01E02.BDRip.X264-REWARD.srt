<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:04,756
<i>This story is about a town,</i>

3
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:07,092
<i>once wholesome and innocent,
now forever changed</i>

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,720
<i>by the mysterious
death of Jason Blossom
on the 4th of July.</i>

5
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:13,223
- Can we talk, Ms. Grundy?
- About what?

6
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,058
<i>You're the music
teacher, can we talk
about music?</i>

7
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:18,853
We heard what we heard
and afterwards
we didn't do anything.

8
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:23,400
How would we explain why
we were together at 6:00 a.m.
on the 4th of July?

9
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:24,734
Hello, Fred.

10
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:26,403
- Can I get you anything?
- A job.

11
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:28,947
I can't very well have
the wife of Hiram Lodge,

12
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:30,865
on trial for fraud
and embezzlement,

13
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,409
balancing my books.

14
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:34,619
Betty and Archie
are endgame.

15
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:37,789
<i>I'm not gonna
ask what you did
with Veronica at Cheryl's.</i>

16
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:41,126
I'm asking you now, right now,
if you love me, Archie.

17
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:43,086
I can't give you
the answer you want.

18
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,089
Oh, my God, it's Jason.

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,633
He was shot.

20
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:55,432
<i>I think many of us,
maybe the entire town,</i>

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,687
<i>had been hoping against hope
that somehow Jason Blossom
hadn't drowned on July 4th.</i>

22
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,940
<i>That we'd come to school
Monday morning,</i>

23
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:06,568
<i>and there Jason would be.</i>

24
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:12,407
<i>Or that we'd see him
and Cheryl in a booth
at Pop's.</i>

25
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:15,452
<i>But that was before the
undeniable, irrevocable fact</i>

26
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,829
<i>of his bloated,
water-logged body,</i>

27
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:20,874
<i>a corpse with a bullet hole
in its forehead,</i>

28
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,959
<i>and terrible secrets that
could only be revealed</i>

29
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:26,588
<i>by the cold, steel blade of
a coroner's autopsy scalpel,</i>

30
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:30,425
<i>or the telltale beating
of a guilty heart.</i>

31
00:02:33,613 --> 00:02:34,697
Archie, what are
you doing here?

32
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:36,574
- It wasn't fireworks,
Ms. Grundy.
- You can't be here, Archie.

33
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:39,244
- On July 4th,
it was a gunshot we heard.
- You can't come to my house.

34
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:41,371
Probably the shot that
killed Jason Blossom.

35
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,706
We know exactly
what the police know.

36
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:45,208
That a gun was fired.

37
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,669
That a boy was shot.
We don't know by whom.

38
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,713
We know when it was fired.
That's something
the police still don't know.

39
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,215
They're performing
an autopsy.

40
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:53,883
We could call
them, anonymously.

41
00:02:54,092 --> 00:03:00,473
This is not a negotiation,
Archie. This is our lives.

42
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:02,559
If anybody knows
that we were there,

43
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:06,604
I could lose my job.
You could be expelled.
We could go to jail.

44

Subtittle By | SupunWe |

45
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:12,861
All right.
Here you go, Vegas.

46
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:15,363
Good boy.

47
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:16,948
Wow.

48
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:19,659
- Morning, Dad.
- Hey, bud.

49
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,704
Where'd you sneak
off to last night?

50
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,497
You, uh, you heard that?

51
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:27,917
Son, I've been hearing you
sneak out since you were
eight years old

52
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,836
going to Jughead's tree house.

53
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:33,882
I couldn't sleep.
Went for a jog to tire
myself out.

54
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:35,925
Yeah? Got something
on your mind?

55
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,597
- Just all this stuff
with Jason.
- Hmm.

56
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:44,350
No more midnight runs until
the police catch whoever it
was that shot that poor kid.

57
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,352
I swear to God, this town.

58
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,024
Hey, honey?

59
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,485
We just wanted you to know,
it's gonna be a bit of a
late night for us.

60
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:57,280
It's going to be
a lot of late nights for us.

61
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,991
I mean, an accidental
drowning, who cares?

62
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,286
But the sociopathic son
of the wealthiest family
in town, murdered?

63
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:06,206
That's a national obsession
waiting to happen.

64
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,832
He's barely
in his grave, Alice.

65
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,043
Can you warm up the car, Hal?
I'll be right down.

66
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:16,382
Betty, you know what
I love most about you?

67
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:20,261
It's that you always want to
see the good in people.

68
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:22,222
Even people
like Cheryl Blossom

69
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,432
and Veronica Lodge
and Archie Andrews.

70
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,976
But when they
betrayed you this weekend,

71
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,978
you saw
their true colors, didn't you?

72
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:31,147
I did. I definitely did.

73
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:33,149
So no backsliding.

74
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,402
No Cheryl. No Veronica and...

75
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:37,946
No Archie.

76
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,118
Walk me to school?

77
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,581
I needed time to process.

78
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,127
To separate what my mom
wants from what I want...
I think I want.

79
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:54,754
Which is?

80
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:57,131
My mom says I should
never speak to you again.

81
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,175
But I...

82
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:03,846
Even though you don't
like me like that,

83
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:07,475
I still want us to be
friends... Best friends.

84
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:08,935
You do?

85
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,061
Yeah.

86
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,273
I mean, that's great, Betty.
Me, too.

87
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:16,693
I'd be lying if
I said that it didn't hurt.

88
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:20,655
And I'm sorry, Betty,
I didn't do it to be a...

89
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,701
I don't know, I just...
I thought it would be
better in the long run.

90
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:25,660
And it will be.

91
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,999
Oh, and don't tell my mom
that we're friends again.

92
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:42,468
Hi.

93
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,932
Do you think I can use Jason
Blossom's death as an excuse
to get out of PE?

94
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,478
"Sorry, Coach, I'm just too
depressed and freaked-out
right now to do pull-ups."

95
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,690
Don't joke about
Jason Blossom.

96
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:56,983
What?

97
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,610
Sardonic humor
is just my way of relating
to the world.

98
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:05,408
Look, it's the
rich kids from <i>The Goonies.</i>

99
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,203
All right, I'm out.

100
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,335
Watch it, Wednesday Addams.

101
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,254
Now that romance is off
the table, I'll just say it.

102
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:20,173
Are we 100% sure
that Archie's straight?

103
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:23,051
Because no straight man
has that body.

104
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:26,471
Speaking of bodies...

105
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:29,474
Have you recovered from
finding Jason's?

106
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:31,976
It was more traumatizing
having to explain to my dad

107
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:33,686
what I was doing
with Moose at the river.

108
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,272
Yet another perk
of being the sheriff's son.

109
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,776
Oh, my God,
those are gorgeous.

110
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,611
Are those for Betty,
Mrs. Philips?

111
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:43,988
That's why I called her.

112
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:50,870
"Dear Betty,
please forgive me, XOXO, V."

113
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,872
Who the hell is "V"?

114
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,791
- Veronica.
- Veronica.

115
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:56,918
The yellow is for friendship.

116
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:01,422
I also had Magnolia cupcakes
flown in from New York.

117
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,299
Because, as my mom
likes to say,

118
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:06,386
"There's no wrong the right
cupcake can't fix."

119
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:11,140
Also I... I've booked us
for hers-and-hers mani-pedis
at Chez Salon.

120
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:13,476
Blowouts, too.

121
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,479
I am so, so sorry, Betty.

122
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:20,483
I don't know what happened
to me that night. It was such
a basic bitch move.

123
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,318
It was like I was...

124
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:23,444
Possessed by...

125
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:24,779
Madame Satan?

126
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:28,616
The old Veronica.

127
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,205
And I will never, ever do
anything like that to
you again.

128
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:36,416
I swear on my mother's pearls.

129
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:41,003
Just, can you please give me
one more chance?

130
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:44,340
Okay.

131
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:46,634
- What?
- What?

132
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:48,010
Really?

133
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:51,389
Awesome. I'll take it
and you won't regret it.

134
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:52,598
Okay.

135
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,016
And I'll bring these
to lunch so we can celebrate!

136
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,150
It's the path of least
resistance, Kev.

137
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:06,195
A week ago, Veronica
and I weren't friends.

138
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:09,991
Next week, we'll nod
to each other as we pass
in the hall, but that's it.

139
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,535
You know, in two weeks,
she won't even
remember my name.

140
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,455
And in three,
she'll have latched on to
some other girl to destroy.

141
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,709
<i>Good morning,
students. This is your
principal speaking.</i>

142
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,545
There have been many inquiries
about the upcoming pep rally.

143
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:26,340
So let me state clearly,
it is happening, as scheduled.

144
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,513
Now, on a less felicitous
note, if you could give your
attention to Sheriff Keller.

145
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,394
Most of you already
know the details,

146
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:43,983
<i>but your classmate
Jason Blossom's body
was found late Saturday night.</i>

147
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:49,155
<i>So as of the weekend,
Jason's death is now being
treated as a homicide.</i>

148
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:53,826
<i>It is an open
and ongoing investigation.</i>

149
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:57,163
And may I interject,
neither I nor my parents

150
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,081
will rest until Jason's
death is avenged,

151
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,045
and his cold-hearted killer
is walking the green mile
to sit in Old Sparky and fry.

152
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,798
I, for one,
have my suspicions.
Hashtag Riverdale strong.

153
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:12,887
If you know anything

154
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,516
<i>that could help us find
and apprehend Jason's killer,</i>

155
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:20,353
<i>or anything about what
happened to him on July 4th,</i>

156
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:24,273
<i>I strongly urge you to
come forward immediately.</i>

157
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:28,277
You can speak with me
or Principal Weatherbee.

158
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:30,530
A death like this
wounds us all.

159
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,406
<i>Let's not let Jason down.</i>

160
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:37,578
Archie.

161
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,960
Weirdest thing.
This summer, we were
supposed to go on a road trip

162
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,296
over July 4th weekend...

163
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:52,093
Which you bailed on
at the last minute.

164
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,139
Is there something
you wanna tell me, pal?

165
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:16,909
We were wondering, Cheryl.

166
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,995
Back in July, you told
the po-po that Jason drowned.

167
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:22,957
Yet, we come to find out
that Jason didn't drown.

168
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,460
He was shot. That's
slightly suspicious, no?

169
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:30,214
Are you living mannequins
suggesting I had something
to do with my brother's death?

170
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:32,758
We're just curious. What do
the police think happened?

171
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:36,679
I'll tell you what I told
them, which is that Jason
did fall into the water.

172
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:40,808
We both did.
I made it to the shore.
He didn't.

173
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:44,228
Maybe he made it to the other
side of the river and someone
shot him there. Who knows?

174
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:47,732
Seats, everyone. Pair off,
gloves on, scalpels up.

175
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,816
Can I be with Cheryl?

176
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,109
And I wanna be with Betty.

177
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:53,321
Oh, uh, I was thinking
I'd partner with Kevin.

178
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,949
Actually, uh,
Keller's with me.
We, like, talked.

179
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:58,826
Oh, God.

180
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,457
- Once again,
fate throws us together.
- Hmm.

181
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,252
So... Saturday night.

182
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,421
Listen, Moose,
you're hot. Yes.

183
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,549
My type? Definitely.

184
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:15,801
But you've got more
demons than <i>The Exorcist.</i>

185
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,970
We're all on the spectrum,
but my gay-o-meter

186
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,890
says you should stick with
what you know best... Girls.

187
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,601
Cheryl, we haven't talked
since the summer.

188
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,978
I just want to say, I'm really
sorry about your brother.

189
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,605
Jason was the best.

190
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:29,565
If I can do anything to help.

191
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,276
That's sweet, Archie,
but unless you were
at Sweetwater River

192
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:33,944
and know who shot Jason...

193
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,457
Do, uh, do you know if
the police have any leads?

194
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:50,878
What? No, you ghoul. But it's
only a matter of time.

195
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:54,256
And my twintuition
is telling me it's someone
we all know.

196
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,636
Right. Well,
I'm not great at science,

197
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,138
but I can take point on this
if it's too weird for you.

198
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,182
Weird, why?

199
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:07,978
Oh, you mean because
my brother is being
dissected with a blade,

200
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,731
just like this one, possibly
at this very moment?

201
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,359
Don't worry, I'm fine.

202
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:17,279
In fact, I'm amazing.

203
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:21,951
Every corpse has
as tale to tell.
Step closer to the body.

204
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:27,540
There are several morbid
details you should find
relevant to your article.

205
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,251
What details, Dr. Curdle?

206
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,545
What sticks out to you?

207
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:36,298
The marbling of the veins.
Signs of scavenger activity.

208
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,884
Ligature marks on both wrists.

209
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:42,513
And a hint
of cryo-necrotic preservation.

210
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,519
Small bills, right?

211
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,776
So, what did Moose want?

212
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:58,112
Oh, my God,
I don't even think he knows.

213
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,990
I mean, I am devastatingly
handsome in that classic,

214
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,992
pre-accident Montgomery Clift
kind of way,

215
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,538
and sexuality is fluid,
but can someone named
Moose actually be that fluid?

216
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:10,040
Okay, well, I ship it.

217
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:13,127
Well, of course you would.
You're a big city
girl with loose morals.

218
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,507
I just meant that Moose has
an official girlfriend, Midge.

219
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,596
Anyway, it's terrible to say,
but part of me wishes he would
just stay in the darn closet.

220
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:29,101
Obviously, I didn't
mean literal closet.

221
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,478
Archie!

222
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:35,566
Any new material
you wanna try out on
a very forgiving audience?

223
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:36,692
I...

224
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:37,943
Please?

225
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:39,862
Would you?

226
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:41,906
I'd love to hear it.

227
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,202
I'm still working
on the lyrics, so...

228
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:48,704
Okay.

229
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:56,796
<i>♪ Come on, turn the radio on</i>

230
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:01,175
<i>♪ And, honey
we'll dance, dance, dance</i>

231
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,011
<i>♪ For the rest of the night</i>

232
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:07,765
<i>♪ I'm not ready to go ♪</i>

233
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,076
Betty?

234
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,287
You okay?

235
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,918
I'm supposed to say, "Yes."

236
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,797
That's what the nice girl
always says, but...

237
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,132
No, I'm not.

238
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,427
I want to be.
I thought I could be.
But it's too much, too fast.

239
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,346
- Archie...
- Betty.

240
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:48,764
Betty, wait.

241
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:57,481
- Betty, wait. Come on.
Listen to me.
- No.

242
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,486
No, when... When I think,
Archie, of where I feel safest
and most myself,

243
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,697
- I think of us,
in a booth, at Pop's...
- Me, too.

244
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,657
But that's not true anymore.

245
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,160
I thought I could pretend this
weekend didn't happen, but...

246
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,330
"I can't give you
the answer you want."

247
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:14,498
That's what you said to me.

248
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:16,584
And that's how I feel
right now, I'm sorry.

249
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:17,585
Betty.

250
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:18,794
Mr. Andrews.

251
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,131
If we could have
a word in private.

252
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,303
You're in a very good place
right now, Mr. Andrews.

253
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,473
Varsity football,
AP music tutorials.

254
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,270
This morning, in the hallway,
you wouldn't meet my eyes.

255
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:38,314
Why?

256
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:40,190
I was distracted.
I wasn't feeling well.

257
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,692
Archie...

258
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,987
If there's something you want
to get off your chest,

259
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:50,659
perhaps about Jason,
now would be the time.

260
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:57,583
Weatherbee just asked me if
I knew anything about Jason.

261
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,710
And?

262
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,295
What did you say?

263
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,380
Nothing. That I didn't.

264
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,884
But he said that if I did,
I shouldn't be scared,
and he'd make sure I was okay.

265
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,928
Of course he would,
you're his student.

266
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,222
Is this...

267
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,225
How you feel about me?

268
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:16,727
Is it real?

269
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:23,192
Because if it's not,
then I don't know
what I'm protecting.

270
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,113
It is.

271
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:32,993
It is real.

272
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:39,249
Maybe it's not right,
but it's real.

273
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,753
Which is why...

274
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,547
We... You...

275
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,801
Can't go to Weatherbee.

276
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,052
If you do that,

277
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,180
we will never see each
other again.

278
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,855
Archie,

279
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,900
I'm putting myself in
your hands.

280
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:33,804
<i>♪ L-E-T-S G-o</i>

281
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:36,098
<i>♪ L-E-T-S G-o</i>

282
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,599
<i>♪ Let's go, let's go</i>

283
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:38,642
<i>♪ Go and get it, get it</i>

284
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:39,768
<i>♪ Let's go, let's go</i>

285
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,145
<i>♪ Go and get it, get it</i>

286
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:43,480
Stand down, Vixens.

287
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:44,565
And listen up.

288
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,694
The weather's
predicting a downpour
the night of the rally,

289
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,321
but already, you're raining
on my parade.

290
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:54,700
With Jason so present in our
collective consciousness,

291
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,452
all eyes will be on me.

292
00:17:57,453 --> 00:18:00,164
Will this beautiful, exotic,
hothouse flower

293
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:01,832
drown under the
town's scrutiny,

294
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,834
or be swamped by her emotions?

295
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:07,629
The answer, ladies,
is "no" and "no."

296
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:11,133
That said, I need star power.

297
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:13,761
I need the Pussycats.

298
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,513
Stay loose and limber, ladies,
while I make a call.

299
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,814
After this practice, I'll
totally need a pedicure. You?

300
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,234
I'll have homework.

301
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,616
I know everyone
grieves differently,

302
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:38,243
but Cheryl's hosting
a pep rally to cope
with her loss.

303
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:41,205
That's either brilliant,
or psychotic, or both.

304
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,249
Yeah, well, at least Cheryl's
not putting on an act.

305
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:48,170
Pretending she's a butterfly
when really she's a wasp.

306
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,220
For the record,
the only reason I went
into that closet with Archie

307
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,055
was so that Cheryl wouldn't.

308
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,516
- Oh, so you did
it to protect me?
- Damn straight.

309
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,852
Okay, so nothing happened
between you and Archie
in the closet, then?

310
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,233
Yeah, that's what I thought.
You know, Archie and I were
fine before you got here.

311
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,692
If by, fine,

312
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:14,363
you mean he was oblivious
and you were pining after him
in quiet desperation.

313
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:15,989
We were friends, at least.

314
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,909
You were walking on emotional
eggshells around him,
scared to tell him the truth.

315
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:20,327
Okay, you don't
know me, Veronica.

316
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:21,703
It is not my fault he
doesn't like you.

317
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:27,668
If that's what
you're thinking.

318
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,003
It's not anyone's fault.
It's not even stupid Archie's.

319
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,713
It's just how it is.

320
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,925
Most of the time
the people we like
don't like us back.

321
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,053
Romeo and Juliet are
the exception, not the rule.

322
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:40,097
Look...

323
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:44,184
Never speak to me again.
If that's what you want,
I'll accept that.

324
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,436
But what, exactly,
did Archie do wrong?

325
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:49,106
- Are you seriously
taking his side?
- No, I'm not taking any...

326
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,774
And this is your way of trying
to be friends with me again?

327
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,944
The Pussycats are in.
Oh, sorry, ladies,
am I interrupting?

328
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:55,612
- As a matter of fact...
- No, you're not.

329
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:57,990
Actually, I was about
to come and find you, Cheryl.

330
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,868
I have a gift certificate for
hers-and-hers mani-pedis

331
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,494
and blowouts at Chez Salon.

332
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:03,912
- Do you want to come with me?
- Don't do this.

333
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,455
Butt out, closet monster.

334
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,833
You have forfeited
your right to take
the high and mighty road.

335
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,795
As <i>pour moi</i>, Betty,
but of course.

336
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,463
I never say no to a pedi.

337
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,549
And I was just about to
suggest the same thing.

338
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,593
Can I steal her for a second?

339
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,694
You're doing great, Mom.
Better than me this week.

340
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,822
Yeah, we're surviving,
Ronnie, by our wits,

341
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,033
because that's what
we Lodge women do.

342
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,827
If Dad could see us now.

343
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:47,497
He'd say you look stunning
in that new uniform.

344
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:51,168
I'm going for this
Joan Crawford, Mildred Pierce
thing. Is it working?

345
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,836
Definitely.

346
00:20:59,009 --> 00:20:59,968
Hi.

347
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:01,595
Hi.

348
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,097
And who might this
heartbreaker be?

349
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,351
I'm picking up an order
for Andrews.

350
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,478
Oh, you're Fred's son?

351
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,231
You're as handsome
as your father was.

352
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,732
I'll see you
at home, Mom.

353
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:17,569
Uh, wait. I'm sure Archie
would happily escort you.

354
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,117
Is, uh, Betty still
mad at you?

355
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,620
We're back to no texting.

356
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:27,871
What about you?

357
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:33,377
I'm back to being the shallow,
toxic, rich bitch who ruins
everything in her path.

358
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:37,547
Which is unfortunate,
because even though
I only just met Betty,

359
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:40,217
it really felt like
we were meant
to be best friends.

360
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:44,596
Like... Like it was
our destiny, and now...

361
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:49,059
It's like there was
this train that was heading
to the rest of my life

362
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:51,645
and I just missed it.

363
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,484
Betty and I have been
next-door neighbors
since we were four.

364
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:01,655
We've always gone
to the same school,
been in the same class.

365
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:05,325
I remember in
the second grade,

366
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:07,577
I was having trouble reading,
and my teacher, Mrs. Gribrock,

367
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:10,956
told my mom and dad that
I should stay back a year,
to get caught up.

368
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,876
Betty was so against us
not being in the same grade

369
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:18,297
that she took it upon herself
to tutor me every single day.

370
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:21,133
- In the second grade?
- Yeah.

371
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,428
Anyway, when I passed,
thanks to Betty,

372
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,848
I kissed her and I asked
her to marry me.

373
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,727
She was like,
"Oh, little Archie,
we're too young."

374
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,937
"Ask me when we're 18
and I'll say yes."

375
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,230
Wow.

376
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,027
I hate that I hurt her.

377
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:45,157
Give her time, Archie.
That's all you can do.

378
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:50,871
And don't despair.
I don't think your story
with Betty is over.

379
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,049
Your room's so sweet.

380
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:07,721
It's too pink.
It doesn't feel right anymore.

381
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,931
No, I like how girly it is.

382
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:11,808
Mine is, too.

383
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:13,852
You should come over
and see it sometime.

384
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,355
But, just you, not Veronica.

385
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,401
I mean, she must be evil
incarnate if even you won't
have her as a friend.

386
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,990
And on the subject
of being friends,

387
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,118
Betty, I'm sorry I've been
such a witchy-witch to you.

388
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,580
After Polly and Jason's
epic demise

389
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,457
I was angry...

390
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:37,084
At everyone.

391
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,586
But I took it out on you
which was super unfair.

392
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:40,962
Especially since,

393
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:45,092
in a way, it's kinda like
we both lost siblings.

394
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,013
How, uh, how is Polly?

395
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:51,807
Is she still in that
group home?

396
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,768
Do you think she knows
what happened to Jason,
that he was murdered?

397
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,022
I...
I'm not sure.

398
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,524
What do you think
went down between them?

399
00:24:00,732 --> 00:24:01,650
I don't know...

400
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:02,776
What do your parents say?

401
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,528
About Jason and Polly?

402
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,530
Not a lot.

403
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:07,906
Same.

404
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:12,202
I keep thinking that maybe
Jason said something to her
or she said something to him.

405
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:15,372
I mean, didn't they have
a big fight this summer, or...

406
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,166
Why are you asking me
so many questions about Polly?

407
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,547
Cheryl?

408
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,883
Because, you dumb cow,
someone shot my brother

409
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,511
and I think it was your crazy,
tweaked-out sister.

410
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,235
Get out of my house.

411
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:46,778
Not until you tell me...

412
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:50,365
Cheryl, get the hell out of my
house before I kill you.

413
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,334
Jug. What's up?

414
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,046
What's up is
I saw you, Archie.

415
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,383
In the music room.
With Ms. Grundy.

416
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:10,010
Keep your voice down,
my dad's inside.

417
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,929
I'm trying to help you, dude.

418
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:15,015
I'm trying to be
your friend here.

419
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,683
Even though we're not anymore.

420
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:18,602
How long?

421
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,479
You and Grundy?

422
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:23,982
Since the summer.

423
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,277
I like her.

424
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:33,325
So I'm guessing
she's the reason you've been
acting weird since summer?

425
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,785
One of them.

426
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,497
"One of them." There's more?

427
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,376
We were at
Sweetwater River on July 4th.

428
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,466
We heard a gunshot.
The gunshot.

429
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,511
- Dude, you have
to tell somebody.
- I can't.

430
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,347
Neither can you. If people
find out about Grundy...

431
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,057
A kid is dead, Archie!

432
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,519
And you're worried about
some... Some cougar?

433
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,062
Don't call her that.

434
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,022
Okay, she's not like that,
she cares about me.

435
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:05,607
Stab in the dark.

436
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,443
I'm guessing she
cares more about herself.

437
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:09,653
She's the one
who's telling you

438
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:11,238
not to say anything, right?

439
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:17,244
Look, I saw you guys.
She's messing with you, man.

440
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:18,870
And she's messing
with your mind...

441
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,580
What the hell do you
know about it, Jughead?

442
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,040
Or about me, even?

443
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,043
Nothing.

444
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,547
But I used to know
this guy once.

445
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,215
Archie Andrews.

446
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,593
He wasn't perfect but...

447
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:38,223
He always tried to do
the right thing, at least.

448
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,057
Jug.

449
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,019
If you tell anyone
about this...

450
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:46,314
What?

451
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,775
What are you gonna do?

452
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,410
Hey, Jug. Coming in?
We got take-out from Pop's.

453
00:26:58,618 --> 00:26:59,452
He was just leaving.

454
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:15,719
A little sage,
to banish the evil spirits.

455
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:16,970
Mom.

456
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:20,849
I'm not joking, Betty.
That family is pure evil.

457
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:24,102
I'm wondering if the Blossoms
didn't kill Jason themselves.

458
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:28,690
Sacrificed him to some dark
pagan god that they worship in
that insane mansion of theirs.

459
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,275
Mom, does Polly know?

460
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,110
About Jason?

461
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,528
I told her.

462
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:36,406
But half the time, your sister
doesn't even know
what day it is.

463
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:39,034
Mom, why were you so against
them being together?

464
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,745
Many reasons.

465
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,040
That family. Everything
they touch, it rots.

466
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,462
Mom, I was thinking...

467
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:54,382
Maybe it's time I go
visit Polly.

468
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,930
I am so proud of how you
stood up to that dragoness,

469
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:04,559
but honestly, Betty,
why was Cheryl over here
in the first place?

470
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,603
And who else is gonna
come waltzing in?

471
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,480
Veronica? Archie?

472
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,900
How many times are you
gonna let them hurt you?

473
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:15,862
Until I learn my lesson, Mom.

474
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:32,712
You were right.

475
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,967
And what you said
about Archie.

476
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,598
Sometimes it's hard
to admit things to yourself.

477
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,811
My mother is crazy.

478
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,273
I'm afraid I'll never
see my sister again.

479
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,819
The boy I like doesn't
like me back.

480
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:58,113
He may not be crushing on you,

481
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,199
but he does love you.

482
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:05,203
And he's legit
miserable without you,
if it's any consolation.

483
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:10,542
My mom says
sometimes a friend
is better than a boyfriend.

484
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,837
Maybe this is one
of those times.

485
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:20,468
And Sheriff Keller's grilling
me, Mantle the Magnificent.

486
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,137
'Cause I'd want Blossom dead.

487
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:24,431
When he was, like, the only
good quarterback we had.

488
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,892
And speaking of offensive
tight-ends, I should've sent
the cops to you, Moose.

489
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,019
Because here's
another unsolved mystery.

490
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:32,355
What exactly were you
and Kevin doing
at the river, huh?

491
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:36,943
Or does being with
the sheriff's son give you
a free pass? Keller?

492
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,737
Reggie's just being
a blowhard, Kev.

493
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,196
I don't care what he says.

494
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:41,823
I mean, let's think about it.

495
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:44,784
If a kid at Riverdale
killed Jason,

496
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:46,786
it's not gonna
be a jock, right?

497
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,997
Now let's be honest.

498
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:53,710
Isn't it always some
spooky, scrawny,
pathetic Internet troll,

499
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,337
too busy writing
his manifestos to get laid?

500
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:01,593
Some smug, moody,
serial killer fanboy freak,

501
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:04,304
like Jughead?

502
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,557
What was it like,
<i>Suicide Squad?</i>

503
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:09,058
When you shot Jason?

504
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:11,603
You didn't do stuff
to the body, did you?

505
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,646
Like... After?

506
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:18,151
It's called necrophilia,
Reggie, can you spell it?

507
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,444
Come here, you little...

508
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,279
Hey shut the hell up, Reggie.

509
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:22,822
Boys.

510
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:24,741
What do you care, Andrews?

511
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:26,201
Nothing, just leave him alone.

512
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:28,369
Holy crap.

513
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:31,748
Did you and Donnie Darko
kill him together?

514
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:35,502
Was it some sort of pervy,
blood brother thing?

515
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:44,761
<i>♪ No she don't mess around</i>

516
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:46,679
<i>♪ No she don't mess around</i>

517
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,727
Ooh.

518
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:55,730
I hate to ask this,
but did you get that
in a fight with Jughead?

519
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,942
Nah. No, it was with Reggie.

520
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:00,693
It's a long story.

521
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,655
Jughead and I, we were
disagreeing about a girl.

522
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:05,156
Hmm.

523
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:08,827
- Because there's this girl.
- There usually is.

524
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:11,454
But it's not about me
and Jughead, it's about
me and this girl.

525
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,710
I think we should
do something.
And it's the right thing, Dad.

526
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,966
But the girl says that if we
do or if I do this thing,
it'll ruin what we have.

527
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:27,011
That doesn't make
any sense, does it?

528
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:30,849
You know,
this is the most honest talk
we've had in a while.

529
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,393
And I'm glad that you want
to do the right thing.

530
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,769
I can see that.

531
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:37,021
Even under the shiner.

532
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:41,442
Archie, if you know
it's the right thing to do,

533
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:45,864
even though it's tough,
even though it might...
It might cost you.

534
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,200
You gotta do it.

535
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:30,033
I'm gonna come clean
with Weatherbee and Keller.

536
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:32,952
I was there.

537
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,038
I heard the gunshot and
I have to own that.

538
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:37,749
- Archie, slow down.
- I'm gonna do it tomorrow.

539
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,668
If you wanna come with me,
then we can figure that out.

540
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:44,631
If not, I'll respect that
and I'll do everything I can
to keep you out of it.

541
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,345
I'm sorry, Ms. Grundy,
but I have to.

542
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:09,155
Girl trouble? You?

543
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:13,242
Grundy and me.

544
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:14,702
We're telling Weatherbee.

545
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,873
At least, I am.

546
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:24,212
And also, I didn't mean
all that crap I said to you.

547
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:27,882
I'm sorry.

548
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:32,428
It's cool.

549
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,935
We're not gonna hug in front
of this whole town.

550
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:42,605
So why don't we both
just do that bro thing
where we nod like douches

551
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,941
and mutually
suppress our emotions?

552
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:47,026
Yeah, but as friends, right?

553
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:48,528
To be discussed,

554
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,032
over many burgers,
and many days.

555
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:09,465
Oh, my God, Arch. Your eye.

556
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,893
<i>Now to kickoff this pep rally,
I'd like to hand it over</i>

557
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,645
<i>to our very own Mayor McCoy.</i>

558
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:25,231
<i>Thank you,
Principal Weatherbee.</i>

559
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:31,279
<i>It is heartening to see
so many of you here,
even in weather like this.</i>

560
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:36,784
<i>But a lack of heart
and school spirit has never
been the Riverdale way.</i>

561
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:41,122
<i>Tonight's pep rally
isn't like any other
we've had in the past.</i>

562
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:43,583
<i>And we shouldn't
pretend that it is.</i>

563
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:47,837
<i>Which is why I would like
to dedicate this evening</i>

564
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,465
<i>to the memory of
one of our brightest.</i>

565
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,925

Cheryl, what is it?

595
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:27,538
What happened?

596
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:31,918
Jason.

597
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:35,213
He's gone...

598
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:41,636
I know. I know he is.

599
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:44,347
No, you don't.
You don't understand.

600
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:48,351
He was supposed to come back.

601
00:37:58,027 --> 00:37:59,320
I'm alone.

602
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,489
I'm alone.

603
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:07,119
You're not alone. It's okay.

604
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,425
Hey.

605
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:22,593
Hey.

606
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:24,845
I saw you and Cheryl.

607
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:29,475
Not many girls
would've done what you did.

608
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:34,939
Full disclosure.
I've had my share
of emotional breakdowns.

609
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,151
If you're not doing anything,

610
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:43,114
do you wanna go get
a milkshake at Pop's?

611
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,868
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

612
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:50,454
Betty, I'd love that.

613
00:38:56,252 --> 00:39:00,298
Here you go.
One double chocolate
and one old-fashioned vanilla.

614
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,215
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

615
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:05,511
Betty...

616
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,014
Can we make a vow?

617
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,140
Sure.

618
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:14,103
That no matter what,
no boy will ever come
between us again.

619
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:17,690
Deal?

620
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,192
Deal.

621
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:45,217
Do you guys want to join us?

622
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:50,056
Yes, but only
if you're treating.

623
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:55,603
- Veronica Lodge.
- Jughead Jones, the third.

624
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,480
Jughead Jones, the third.

625
00:39:57,688 --> 00:39:59,648
<i>To someone on the
outside, peering in,</i>

626
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,818
<i>it would've looked like
there were four people
in that booth.</i>

627
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:05,279
<i>But I was there,
and I can tell you.</i>

628
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:07,365
<i>Really, there were only three.</i>

629
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:11,535
<i>A blonde girl,
a raven-haired girl,</i>

630
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:15,039
<i>and the luckiest red-headed

631
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:19,251

Because of the autopsy?

644
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:12,680
We don't need
to do this in front of your
classmates, Cheryl.

645
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:14,974
It's all right,
Principal Weatherbee.

646
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,601
They'll find out soon enough.

647
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,103
Now, that won't be necessary.

648
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,897
Wait, Cheryl, find out what?

649
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:26,402
