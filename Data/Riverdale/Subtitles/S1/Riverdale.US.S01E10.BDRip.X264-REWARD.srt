1
00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:02,212
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,631
They're ruining our lives,
and to them it's just a game.

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,841
<i>They keep score
in some secret playbook.</i>

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,718
You want vengeance?
I'm with you.

5
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:11,471
- And I have a plan.
- You like shaming
people, Chuck?

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,431
Apologize for ruining Polly.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,350
- What the hell?
- Do it, Jason!

8
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:18,103
- Apologize for what
you did to me!
- Look, I'm not Jason!

9
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:20,647
This is our insurance.

10
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,400
Here, stash it. Keep it safe.

11
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:25,652
Hermione Lodge will crumble.

12
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,570
Maybe you should've sent her
to jail instead of Hiram.

13
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,197
I heard
Mr. and Mrs. Blossom talking.

14
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:31,074
<i>It sounded like
Clifford Blossom
was responsible</i>

15
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:32,826
<i>for sending
Veronica's dad to jail.</i>

16
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,494
Ever since we started
dating you've ignored me,

17
00:00:34,703 --> 00:00:36,204
- you've ditched me.
- Let me make it up to you.

18
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,123
Sorry, Archie,
but I won't be bought.

19
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:39,541
The lawyers
are coming over this week

20
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:41,292
to take our statements
for your dad's hearing.

21
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:42,585
Am I gonna have to lie?

22
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:44,379
<i>My father is a criminal.</i>

23
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,301
<i>Weekdays,</i>

24
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,848
<i>from 8:25 a.m. to 3:01 p.m.,
we adhere to a strict regimen.</i>

25
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:57,100
Everything in our
lives is controlled.

26
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:00,020
<i>But then something
like the murder of
Jason Blossom happens,</i>

27
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:03,398
<i>and you realize
there is no such thing
as control.</i>

28
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:05,150
<i>There is only chaos.</i>

29
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:14,409
<i>Nevertheless, some of us
strive to impose
and maintain order</i>

30
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:18,371
<i>in what is, fundamentally,
an orderless world.</i>

31
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:24,127
<i>A fact which would
very soon be confirmed</i>

32
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:27,213
<i>in ways none of us
could have foreseen.</i>

33
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:35,013
I'm, uh... I'm headed out.

34
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,140
Sorry to be missing your
birthday this weekend, Jug.

35
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:40,018
Oh, you will not be missing
anything, Mr. Andrews,

36
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,062
I barely acknowledge
my own birthday.

37
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,316
Arch, can you give me
a hand downstairs?

38
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:53,448
The good news is that
all these divorce papers

39
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,366
and legal mumbo jumbo
will be done.

40
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:58,369
Should be behind us
by the end of the week.

41
00:01:58,578 --> 00:01:59,662
Are you only
going to see Mom now

42
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,456
because you
and Hermione Lodge...

43
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:04,459
No. No, son, I ended that.

44
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:08,088
Being together,
working together,
not a good idea.

45
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,339
In that case, then,

46
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:13,927
why finalize things
in such a final way now?

47
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:17,138
Sometimes, son, you just
gotta rip the Band-Aid off.

48
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,391
Or you can try and fix things.

49
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,228
We're past
that point, Archie.

50
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:25,980
I spoke to Mom last week,
she didn't mention
any of this, Dad.

51
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,316
Your mom moved out
two years ago.

52
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:32,445
She didn't tell you
because she wanted me
to be the bearer of bad news.

53
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:35,115
What if I came with you?

54
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:37,492
This is between
me and your mom.

55
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:40,703
I'll check in.

56
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,381
What's going on?

57
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:55,051
Veronica,
this is Paul Sowerberry,
your father's attorney.

58
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,803
He's here to prep us
for our statements

59
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,096
and help
at your dad's hearing.

60
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:01,266
Except, I told you, Mom,
I'm not giving one.

61
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:02,976
- Not one you'd want.
- Just...

62
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,435
You won't be asked
any questions

63
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:06,646
about your father's
business arrangements.

64
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:08,982
We just need you
and your mother
to speak to his character.

65
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,275
It'll humanize him.

66
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:11,985
Which could mean
a lesser sentence.

67
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,194
If you don't make a statement,

68
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,530
well, that's problematic
and damaging.

69
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,490
I've already told her
all of this.

70
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:20,493
Well, Dad made his bed.
And I'm late for school.

71
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:24,164
Veronica, there's something
we need to talk to you about.

72
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,206
Bring it.

73
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:27,709
After the morning I've had,
I'm ready for just about
anything.

74
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,211
Okay, well, Archie
was with the Blossoms.

75
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,423
While their Board
was in town, he, um...

76
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:36,759
Why don't you tell her?
You were there.

77
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,305
Why is this suddenly feeling
like a friendtervention?

78
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:42,807
I overheard Mr. Blossom
say he's the one responsible

79
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:45,268
for your dad being arrested
and put in jail.

80
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,730
Are you kidding?

81
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,357
Why the hell
would Clifford Blossom

82
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,401
have anything to do
with why he's in prison?

83
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,449
Hey, you may
or may not know this,

84
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:02,744
but it's Jughead's birthday.

85
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:06,331
What?
And he didn't say anything?

86
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,000
It's tomorrow,
and he doesn't like
making a big deal out of it.

87
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,377
Every year, he goes
to a double feature
at the Bijou.

88
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,004
It's like this tradition.

89
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:15,715
Last few years,
I've been his movie-buddy.

90
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:16,799
But now
that he has a girlfriend...

91
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,134
Well, of course,
I'll take him.

92
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:19,469
But you should
still come with us.

93
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:20,803
No. I don't wanna
be a third wheel.

94
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:23,264
Come on.
It'll be like old times.

95
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:24,724
The Three Musketeers.

96
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:30,063
Actually, Archie,
there were four Musketeers.

97
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,648
I'll see you later, Betty.

98
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:32,774
Okay.

99
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,526
<i>Yeah, this is Jones.</i>

100
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:38,696
<i>Mr. Jones, hi,
this is Betty Cooper.</i>

101
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:40,949
<i>- Jughead's...</i>
- Girlfriend, yeah, I remember.

102
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:44,911
Great, well, I'm calling
because it's Jughead's
birthday tomorrow,

103
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,664
and I wanted to see
if maybe you would come

104
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:50,667
<i>see a movie with us,
maybe grab dinner?</i>

105
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,293
Does he know
you're calling me?

106
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:55,338
No, I thought
maybe I'd surprise him.

107
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,382
Oh, man.

108
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,259
There's one thing
that Jughead likes less

109
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,302
than surprises,
and that's his birthday.

110
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,513
Kid's never even had a party,
never wanted one...

111
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,515
- What? Never?
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

112
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:09,352
Anyway, I think the best gift
that I could give to Jughead

113
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,520
would be to stay away.

114
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,188
<i>But I appreciate
the call, Betty.</i>

115
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:13,856
Okay.

116
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,236
Anyway,
enough about my drama.

117
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,571
Betty, you were saying
something about Jughead's
birthday?

118
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,615
Yeah.
Just that Mr. Jones told me

119
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:25,201
- Jughead's never had
a birthday party.
- Mmm-hmm.

120
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:27,578
Let's have one for him.

121
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:29,414
Like, a low-key
surprise party.

122
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:31,708
- Uh, no, no.
- That's a fantastic idea.

123
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,084
Jughead doesn't
like his birthday.

124
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:34,502
Everybody says that,
nobody means it.

125
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:35,753
Jughead is a lone wolf.

126
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:37,672
Okay.
Ignoring the negativity.

127
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,965
Betty, you know me,

128
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,426
- any excuse to wear
a cute party dress.
- Yeah.

129
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:45,722
Okay, so I'm thinking
a quaint gathering,
inner-circle only.

130
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,683
Oh, my God,
don't turn around.

131
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:04,032
Holy Chuck,
I think his lats got bigger.

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,409
Not that I care,
because he's evil incarnate.

133
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:07,785
What's Chuck Clayton
doing back?

134
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,287
He got suspended,
not expelled.

135
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:12,081
Even though he should
have been drawn and quartered
for what he did.

136
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:13,124
Oh, my God.

137
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,376
Get away from her, Chuck.

138
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:19,130
Easy. Look, I only came
over here to apologize.

139
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:20,631
You don't have to go
Dark Betty on me again.

140
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,008
I'm not going!

141
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,888
I'm not going Dark anything.

142
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:29,724
Ethel, is Chuck bothering you?

143
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,934
You can relax,
Betty, it's fine.

144
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:35,229
Yeah, Betty, we're fine.

145
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,107
The real question is, are you?

146
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,333
What was he doing?
Accosting her?

147
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,503
No, he was... Apologizing.

148
00:06:58,711 --> 00:06:59,962
Oh, I'm so sure.

149
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,673
Chuck Clayton doesn't have
a contrite bone in his
muscle-bound body.

150
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:04,550
You know what, can we talk
about something else?

151
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,719
Like... Like Jughead's
surprise party.

152
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,557
Betty?

153
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:17,021
Look,
there's a lot I can't do,
a lot I can't control.

154
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,189
But I can damn well make sure

155
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:20,691
my boyfriend has the best
birthday of his life.

156
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,485
Screw it. I'm with Betty.

157
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,278
My dad's away.
We can do it at my house.

158
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,696
We could all use a good time.

159
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,156
Now you're talking
my language.

160
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:29,075
It's gonna be epic.

161
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,629
Mr. Jones,

162
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,591
I didn't mean to ambush you.

163
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,969
I know you don't do birthdays,

164
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,804
but Archie and I are having

165
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,473
a few of Jughead's friends
over at Archie's house.

166
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:56,978
And I bet it would mean
so much to Jughead
if you came.

167
00:07:57,145 --> 00:08:00,231
- Man, you don't quit, do you?
- Rarely, if ever.

168
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,233
I really wanna do
something special for him.

169
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:03,818
And you being there...

170
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:05,903
That would be special.

171
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,283
Great news, Betty.

172
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:13,703
I just had a terrific meeting
with Principal Weatherbee,

173
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,705
who agrees
that the <i>Blue and Gold</i>

174
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,249
can benefit greatly
from my professional guidance

175
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,418
- as your new advisor.
- That's great, Mom.

176
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,003
So what are we working on?

177
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,797
A list of supplies
for Jughead's birthday party.

178
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:27,467
You're really falling
for this Jones boy,
aren't you?

179
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,970
Mom, when you and Dad
started dating,

180
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:34,182
did you tell him everything

181
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,017
about yourself?

182
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,769
I sure did,
and I wish I hadn't.

183
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:40,855
I shared things
with your father,

184
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:44,317
my secrets, fears, doubts.

185
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,360
And he ended up
using them against me.

186
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:47,778
What secrets?

187
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:49,614
Let's just say
that there are some things

188
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:51,908
about myself that
I struggle with.

189
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,784
I trust Jughead, Mom.

190
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:56,996
Of course you do.
And you should.

191
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,248
But just not with everything.

192
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:07,048
So... A John Landis
double feature at the Bijou.

193
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:10,384
<i>American Werewolf in London</i>
and <i>Animal House.</i>

194
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,178
That's awesome. Except...

195
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:13,638
You're going
with Betty instead.

196
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,182
You told her
about my birthday?

197
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,559
Dude, come on.
That's a primal betrayal.

198
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,269
Why do you hate
your birthday so much, Jug?

199
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,314
PTSD from when I was a kid.

200
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,194
I don't know.
Things were always
messed up at home.

201
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,570
Usually because of my dad.

202
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,989
And then there was
this arbitrary day,

203
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:35,868
that we would
just get together and
pretend things were great,

204
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:37,620
we were normal.

205
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,498
And it just made me feel
really lonely.

206
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:44,544
What's all this?

207
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,713
Dad's files
from the basement, Mom.

208
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,340
Archie overheard Mr. Blossom

209
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:50,675
say that he's the one
responsible

210
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,009
for putting Dad in jail.

211
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,387
So I did some digging.

212
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,597
And found this spreadsheet
of monthly payments

213
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:58,975
from Blossom Maple Farms
to Lodge Industries

214
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,561
until about five months ago,
when they stopped.

215
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,396
When your father was arrested.

216
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:04,480
There's more.

217
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,567
The payments,
which are significant,
by the way,

218
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,027
have been happening
for 75 years.

219
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:11,654
That's a ton of money.

220
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,031
What if Clifford
implicated Daddy

221
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,700
to get out of paying
the monthly fee?

222
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:18,244
I wouldn't put it past
the wig-wearing monster.

223
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,162
- We should tell Dad's lawyers.
- Well, hold on.

224
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:23,165
If Clifford did orchestrate
your father's arrest,

225
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,042
people might think
that Hiram had something to do

226
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:26,377
with Jason Blossom's murder.

227
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,045
Ronnie?

228
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,422
You got to let this go.

229
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,631
You don't think Dad could,
in any way,

230
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,926
be responsible for Jason's
murder, do you?

231
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:36,012
No, honey, look,
don't make things worse

232
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,556
by asking questions
that no one else is asking.

233
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:42,310
And please, God, do not
bring the Blossoms into this.

234
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,561
And that includes Cheryl.

235
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:49,150
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

236
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,944
One, two, three, four... Stop.

237
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,073
You're late, Veronica,

238
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:58,409
we've already reviewed
the new choreography
for Homecoming.

239
00:10:58,618 --> 00:10:59,744
That means
you'll be in the back,
where your presence

240
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,120
will do the least
amount of damage.

241
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:02,622
With you front and center,
no doubt.

242
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,831
But of course.

243
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,416
I do have the maddest skills
on this squad.

244
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,043
And because you're a Blossom,

245
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,045
we have to accept whatever
you say as gospel truth?

246
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:12,048
You're welcome
to challenge me, Veronica,
but you'll lose.

247
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,342
We live in a democratic
society, Cheryl.

248
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,678
Let's let the Vixens decide
who's cherry on top.

249
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,388
- Challenge accepted.
- Great.

250
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:25,996
All those for Cheryl?

251
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,543
All those for Veronica?

252
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,843
Never cross a Lodge.

253
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:40,636
Come on, girls.

254
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,103
You catatonic bimbos
didn't even vote.

255
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,356
So you stuttering sapheads
are too dim to exercise
your own rights,

256
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:54,650
and you've got the combined
vocabulary of a baked potato.

257
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,153
Consider this your last
practice as River Vixens,

258
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,530
and your last week
as my social handmaidens.

259
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:01,657
You're fired on all fronts.

260
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:04,201
That's all. Shoo, bitches.

261
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,214
- Hey, Dad, what's up?
<i>- Just checking in.</i>

262
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:19,800
I felt bad we didn't
get the chance to talk more
before I left.

263
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,178
Yeah, well, you kind
of shut me down, Dad.

264
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,513
You seen Mom yet?

265
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,432
No. We were gonna
have dinner, but...

266
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,933
- But what?
- We decided it would be better

267
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:31,604
to meet tomorrow morning,
with the lawyers.

268
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,272
Right.
'Cause things are so bad,

269
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:35,524
you can't talk
without a mediator.

270
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,610
Dad, I gotta go, bye.

271
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:11,519
Okay, so you're the worst.

272
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,689
But it just so happens
that both our archnemesi,

273
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,317
Betty Cooper
and Veronica Lodge,

274
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:21,111
will be at a little shindig
at that chowderhead
Archie's house.

275
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,953
Wanna team-up for a little
destruction, Chuck?

276
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,005
Mr. Sowerberry,
let me tell you
what I think happened.

277
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:43,050
The Blossoms agreed to pay
my family a fee in perpetuity.

278
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,011
Clifford Blossom
tried to end this agreement

279
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,806
so he could stop
paying my family
after all these decades.

280
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,976
And when my father,
being my father, refused,

281
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,603
it was Clifford
who called the police
and got him arrested.

282
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:56,897
That's what I'm thinking.

283
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,732
I can't confirm or deny...

284
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,026
And the reason
this hasn't come out yet

285
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:04,363
is because it might
make my Dad look
like a murder suspect?

286
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:07,032
That is our concern, yes.

287
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:09,618
Have you changed your mind
about making a statement?

288
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,621
If anything,
I'm less inclined.

289
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,331
I told your father
that you were...

290
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,751
Conflicted about helping him.

291
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:24,717
"My darling daughter.

292
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,386
"If you do not testify
on my behalf,

293
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,056
"I'm afraid your poor mother
might be drawn
into this awful mess.

294
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,560
"It pains me to say,
but she is not nearly
as innocent as you believe.

295
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:41,400
"Think carefully about
your next move, Veronica.

296
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:45,070
"The rest of your life,
and your mother's,

297
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,780
"will be decided by it."

298
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,828
Hey,
I was talking to Kevin.

299
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:54,038
He told me
that you and Chuck

300
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:57,082
had some scene
in the cafeteria yesterday.

301
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,584
It wasn't a big deal.

302
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:05,382
What exactly happened
between you guys that night?

303
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,719
Veronica asked me to keep
the details under wraps, okay?

304
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,182
Yeah. All right. No worries.

305
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,977
I only really asked
because you made it sound
like you were upset.

306
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,313
If I was upset about anything,

307
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,856
it was that I had to hear
about your birthday

308
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:23,025
from Archie and not you, Jug.

309
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,569
Yeah, well...

310
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,198
I didn't think you were
an <i>American Werewolf</i>
kind of girl.

311
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,785
Ooh. That's where
you're wrong, Jughead Jones.

312
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,745
I'm all about
the beast within.

313
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:40,042
If it's a double feature,
does that mean I have time
to go to the bathroom?

314
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,293
I'd hold it, Ethel.

315
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,092
Surprise!

316
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,763
Do I look like Jughead to you?

317
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:56,016
Oh. Betty just texted me.
They're almost here.

318
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,518
You've met Joaquin, right?

319
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:58,811
I haven't had the pleasure.

320
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:02,898
Also I thought
it was inner-circle only
tonight?

321
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:05,776
Joaquin's my boyfriend,
that makes him inner-circle.

322
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:09,697
Uh-huh, well, I just came
from the most insane meeting
with my dad's lawyer.

323
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:13,075
Between his upcoming hearing
and his potential involvement
in Jason's murder,

324
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,411
not to mention my mom's,
I'm in a foul mood.

325
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,745
Guys, they're really coming
this time.

326
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:17,746
Everybody hide.

327
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,124
Ugh, I'm so over this.

328
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,342
Surprise!

329
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,970
This is why we left
the double feature.

330
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:34,596
Happy birthday, bro.

331
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,015
You really shouldn't have.

332
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,977
Ugh, you reek. Are you drunk?

333
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,145
No.

334
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,733
Thanks, Veronica.
Thanks, everyone.

335
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,819
- Oh, it's Kevin!
- Happy birthday, bud.

336
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:50,779
This is my boyfriend,
Joaquin.

337
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,781
Hey, nice to meet you.

338
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,409
Um, has anyone seen Betty?

339
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,935
That was haunting, Betty.

340
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,647
Blow out the candles
and make a wish.

341
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,902
I wish it were just
the two of us right now.

342
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,076
One blow!

343
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:41,288
Veronica?

344
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,708
The stuff with your dad?

345
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,460
It's just the tip
of the iceberg.

346
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:47,586
I don't want to talk about it.

347
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:48,504
Okay.

348
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,006
You want a drink?

349
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,800
Isn't it the New York
sophisticate

350
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,885
who's supposed to corrupt
the sweet small-town boy?

351
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,141
My dad's visiting my mom.

352
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,353
They're about to finalize
the divorce.

353
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,106
God, Archie, if my mom had
anything to do with that...

354
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,857
No. This was them.

355
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,651
My mom wanted
to leave Riverdale,

356
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,152
my dad wanted to stay.

357
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,114
I had to choose,
and I chose my dad.

358
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,826
Forget it. It's nothing
compared to what
you're going through.

359
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,038
He threatened me, Archie.

360
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:27,584
Said he would destroy my mom
if I didn't make a statement
on his behalf.

361
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:29,962
Said she was just as guilty
as he was.

362
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,215
And maybe he's lying
or maybe he isn't.

363
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,884
And maybe he killed
Jason Blossom, and...

364
00:19:40,556 --> 00:19:41,431
Oh, sorry.

365
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,060
Just coming to get
ice cream, so...

366
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,311
Is everything okay?

367
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,398
Yeah, no, I'm just not in a
party mood like I usually am.

368
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,608
- That makes two of us.
- Whoa. Wait.

369
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:55,279
You're not actually upset that
I threw you a party, are you?

370
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,781
It is nice, Betty.
I appreciate it.

371
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,408
It's just I would be happier

372
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,243
if it was just the four of us
in a booth at Pop's.

373
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,494
Yeah. But we always do that.

374
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,163
I wanted to do
something special.

375
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,956
"The road to hell is paved
with good intentions."

376
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:08,625
Why is everything
so doom and gloom
with you, Jug?

377
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,210
Why can't it just
be normal for once?

378
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:13,422
I'm not normal,
I'm not wired to be normal.

379
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:17,926
How many more people
did you invite to this thing?

380
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:20,012
No one. Inner-circle only.

381
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,269
Did you really think
you could have a party

382
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,645
without inviting <i>moi?</i>

383
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,772
Or me?

384
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,399
Archie,
where do you want the kegs?

385
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,779
Screw it! One in the kitchen,
one in the backyard.

386
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,266
Why are they doing this?

387
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,352
They're agents of chaos,
Kevin.

388
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,686
They don't need a reason.

389
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:14,233
But if I had to guess?
Payback.

390
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,738
Dude, Valerie just got here.
You think she wants me back?

391
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:20,948
Archie, as my blood-brother,

392
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,866
it was your sole
responsibility

393
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,661
to ensure that something
like this never happened
on my birthday.

394
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:26,995
And now we're here.

395
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,789
In the middle
of a Seth Rogen movie.

396
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,916
This was Betty's idea, okay?
I just went along with it.

397
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,876
- It's so not me.
- It doesn't matter, Jughead,

398
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:34,127
you're her boyfriend now.

399
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,629
- What does that mean?
- It means

400
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,839
you're getting
your birthday party whether
you want one or not.

401
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,595
Dad, hey.

402
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,264
Happy birthday, Jughead.

403
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:48,767
How are you, Mr. Jones?

404
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:51,812
Happy to be here,
celebrating with my son.

405
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:56,316
Didn't realize you had
so many friends.

406
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:57,276
I don't.

407
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,404
And fair warning.
You're the only adult here.

408
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:01,613
So I gather.

409
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,241
- Where can I put this?
- There's a table in the den.

410
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,160
Dad.

411
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,624
- Did Betty call you?
- Yeah, she came by too.

412
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,459
She knows what she wants,
that one.

413
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:16,503
I'll be back.

414
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:26,930
Do you ever go down
to Sweetwater River?

415
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,017
- To what, fool around?
- Yeah.

416
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,477
- Do you?
- I've been once or twice.

417
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,316
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

418
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,821
You can cut the sexual tension
in here with a knife.

419
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,407
What's up, Joaquin?

420
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:46,700
Nothing.

421
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,077
Kevin, you know FP,
Jughead's dad?

422
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,412
Yeah, we've met.

423
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,039
You kicked me out
of the Whyte Wyrm.

424
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,207
Good times. Joaquin...

425
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,001
You wanna show me
where the can is?

426
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,461
- Yeah, it's right...
- Yeah, um...

427
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:58,837
I'll show you.

428
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,692
What is that
middle-aged Serpent

429
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:22,235
doing at a high school kegger?

430
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:23,487
Are you serious?
You don't know?

431
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,030
Veronica,
that's Jughead's dad.

432
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,324
- Really.
- Yeah.

433
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,785
And the plot thickens.

434
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,089
Betty.

435
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,883
- You here to roofie me again?
- No, Chuck,

436
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,969
I'm going to ask you to leave.

437
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,138
- Nicely.
- Nicely?

438
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,766
Because, what, you're back
to being the nice girl now?

439
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:54,768
Betty, what you
and Veronica did

440
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,728
when you guys got me kicked
off the football team,

441
00:23:56,937 --> 00:24:00,565
you ruined any chance I had
of playing for Notre Dame.

442
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:02,275
Hell, for any good school.

443
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:07,155
I'm sorry that after you
sexually harassed those girls,

444
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:10,158
that there were
actual consequences, Chuck.

445
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,453
That night,
I saw the real you.

446
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,209
The dark you.

447
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:21,962
The Betty
that I actually think about

448
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,547
every night
when I'm laying in bed.

449
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,473
You're the last person
I expected to see
at my son's birthday party.

450
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,308
Just doing my job,
keeping my ear to the ground.

451
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,727
And your tongue
in the Sheriff's kid's mouth.

452
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,022
- Did you hear
anything interesting?
- Actually, yeah.

453
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:42,691
Hiram Lodge's
daughter is here.

454
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,569
She said something
about her father being
connected to Jason's murder.

455
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,280
That is not good.

456
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,490
Hiram and I had some business.

457
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:51,950
What does your boyfriend
say about that?

458
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,785
- His father, you mean?
- Yeah.

459
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,829
- I'll find out.
- Yeah. You better.

460
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,707
These kids are more
on the ball than the Sheriff.
Let's go.

461
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:04,337
<i>You do know my dad
has a drinking problem, right?</i>

462
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:05,505
Of course I do.

463
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,299
I didn't think people
would be drinking tonight.

464
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,968
I didn't plan
on Chuck and Cheryl,

465
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,012
and the rest of the school
crashing, okay?

466
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,763
This was supposed
to be just your friends.

467
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,808
You and Archie
are my friends, okay?

468
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:18,935
Everyone else,

469
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,022
including Kevin,
including Veronica,

470
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,607
are people that,
two months ago,

471
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,859
- I would've actively shunned.
- Why?

472
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,570
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm weird.

473
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,447
I'm a weirdo.

474
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:34,242
I don't fit in,
and I don't want to fit in.

475
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:36,703
Have you ever seen me
without this stupid hat on?

476
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:39,206
- That's weird.
- Why are you getting so upset?

477
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:43,502
- It's just a party, Jug.
- It's not just a party.

478
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,588
It's the fact that you
don't know or even care

479
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:50,050
that this is the last thing
I would want.

480
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,010
You did this for you.
To prove something.

481
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,429
- To prove what?
- You're a great girlfriend.

482
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:55,889
I don't know.

483
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:58,225
Doesn't it ever
occur to you just how
different we are?

484
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,686
Like on a cellular DNA
kind of level?

485
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,063
You're a straight-A student,

486
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,149
you're a cheerleader,
for God's sakes.

487
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,401
You're the perfect
girl next door.

488
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,486
I hate that word.

489
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:12,322
I'm the damaged loner outsider

490
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,366
from the wrong side
of the tracks.

491
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,285
Betty, come on.

492
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:18,620
Who are we kidding?

493
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,915
We're on borrowed time.

494
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,333
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

495
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:27,295
Betty, I'm not one
of your projects, okay?

496
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:28,922
Like solving Jason's murder...

497
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,174
No. You're not a project,
you're my boyfriend.

498
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:33,760
Until you're sick
of slumming it with me,

499
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:35,720
or until Archie
changes his mind

500
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,347
and says he wants
to be with you?

501
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,404
Valerie, hey...

502
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:54,489
- I'm looking for Melody.
- No, no, no, can we talk?

503
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,825
I just wanted to say
what if... What if we made
a mistake?

504
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:59,578
First of all,
we didn't do anything.

505
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,830
I broke up with you
because I thought
you were a hot mess.

506
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,748
Clearly, I was right.

507
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,501
Wait, Valerie...

508
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,253
What is your problem, Archie?

509
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,255
You shut me out, remember?

510
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,381
It's too late.

511
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:43,538
<i>Archie,
everything all right?</i>

512
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:50,545
- Jughead. Hey.
- Hey, Ethel.

513
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:53,923
You didn't have
a piece of cake.
It's bad luck.

514
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,967
This whole night
is bad luck.

515
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:59,512
I'm ghosting.
I'll see you at school.

516
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,019
Hey. Whoa.

517
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,312
Where you going,
guest of honor?

518
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,148
Get out of my way, Chuck.

519
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,650
Oh, but you can't leave now.

520
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,653
We haven't even
played our game yet.

521
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,113
Listen up, party people.

522
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,408
Everyone has their secrets.

523
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,118
And we've all done
our fair share of sinning.

524
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:24,496
That's one thing my dear
brother's death has revealed.

525
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,832
So let's play a little game
to get those secrets
out in the open.

526
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,135
What the hell
is Secrets and Sins?

527
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,012
It's a variation
on Truth or Dare.

528
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,723
In which we own our truths.

529
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:45,141
By telling it like it is.

530
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,852
I'll start the game
with Veronica Lodge.

531
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,229
- Naturally.
- Let's begin

532
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,648
with the day you and your
mob wife of a mother

533
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,025
came to town
for a so-called "fresh start."

534
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:55,735
Tell us, Veronica,
what's so fresh

535
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,904
about defiling Archie Andrews
in a closet?

536
00:28:58,113 --> 00:28:59,739
- That was your doing.
- Moving on

537
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:01,241
to dear Daddy Lodge...

538
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:04,285
Isn't it true
that your father, from prison,

539
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,579
illegally purchased
the drive-in land?

540
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:07,997
Which makes me wonder.

541
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:09,666
What else is he doing
from behind bars?

542
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,543
Well,
I can't speak for my father,

543
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,879
but I can think of someone
with a very dirty secret.

544
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:18,007
Specifically, Cheryl killing
her very own brother.

545
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:19,884
Everyone knows how much
I loved my brother.

546
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:20,969
Exactly.

547
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,388
But did you love him maybe

548
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,682
in ways that a sister
shouldn't love a brother?

549
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,978
And as you got older,
Jason started to think
it was strange, unnatural.

550
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:32,272
So he chose Polly over you.

551
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,940
So you shot him
between the eyes

552
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,276
with one of your father's
many hunting rifles.

553
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:39,195
This is riveting,
I can't breathe.

554
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:40,905
This game is sick.

555
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:44,033
- I wanna go next.
- That's the spirit, Doiley.

556
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:46,035
What secrets do you have
to reveal to us?

557
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:48,288
I saw Ms. Grundy's car

558
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:51,207
by Sweetwater River,
the day Jason went missing.

559
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,168
I told Betty and Jughead,

560
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:54,919
and then,
Ms. Grundy quit her job

561
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,380
and left Riverdale,
like, two days later.

562
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:01,301
And let's not forget
that Archie was also at the
Sweetwater that morning.

563
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:03,803
Oh, my God, color me shocked,
Archie Andrews.

564
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:06,765
Is that why you became
a mediocre musician overnight?

565
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:09,476
Because you and Ms. Foureyes
were pulling a Mary Kay
Letourneau?

566
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:10,810
Don't say anything, Archie.

567
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:12,270
Don't get in the gutter
with them.

568
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,773
Wait, what?
Andrews was banging a teacher?

569
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,399
Well, damn,
I wish I would have known.

570
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,735
I would've added you
and Ms. Grundy to the
board of conquests.

571
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:20,653
Classy, Chuck, as always.

572
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,822
Wait a second,
that also explains

573
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,325
why Archie can't seem to keep
a girlfriend to save his life.

574
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,702
He's got serious
Mommy issues.

575
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:29,662
Anything to say for yourself,
Arch?

576
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,498
Were you victim
or perpetrator?

577
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:33,166
Dilton Doiley plays with guns.

578
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:34,125
Big whoop, Betty.

579
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:37,170
So Doiley's a psychopath,
everyone knows that.

580
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:39,130
Well, I guess
it's my turn now.

581
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:43,343
Boy, do I have
a twisted secret to reveal.

582
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,136
Starring Betty Cooper.

583
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,346
Leave her
the hell alone, Chuck.

584
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:47,722
Shut up, Andrews.

585
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,933
Look, you may get a free
peepshow every night,

586
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,309
but you do not know her.

587
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,020
Hell, Betty doesn't
even know herself.

588
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:56,022
Everybody knows
why I got suspended.

589
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,191
But what you don't know...

590
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,363
She dressed up like a hooker,
in a God-awful black wig,

591
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,241
drugged me,
handcuffed me in the Jacuzzi,

592
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:08,034
and I almost drowned

593
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,870
until she got me to say
what she wanted to hear.

594
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,206
And then she really lost it.

595
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:15,416
She actually thought
she was Polly.

596
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,044
But, hey, you knew
all about this, right,
Jughead?

597
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:23,967
Enough! That's enough!

598
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:25,552
Get your hands
off me, snake.

599
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:27,554
Get out!

600
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:32,016
Go on!

601
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,570
What are you looking at?
The party's done.

602
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,865
It's over! Go home!

603
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,162
Whoa, where the hell
are you going?

604
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:56,708
What, you want to give me
some advice on my right hook?

605
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,626
I want you to go back inside
and talk to your girl.

606
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:00,044
I don't think
it's gonna work out.

607
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,256
Irreconcilable differences.

608
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:06,467
Don't run away from it.
Don't run away.

609
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:08,303
You've got something
good here.

610
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:09,929
With her, with your friends.

611
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:11,347
Something that...

612
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:12,891
Something that we could
never give you.

613
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:16,019
Also, man up.

614
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,354
After what I just saw
in there, she needs you.

615
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,619
FP.

616
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:34,495
As block captain
of the Neighborhood Watch,

617
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:35,914
I am obligated to ask you

618
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,582
what you're doing
on this side of town.

619
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,918
Don't act so high
and mighty, Alice.

620
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:42,545
You may not live
on the Southside anymore,

621
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:45,089
you may not dress like
you're from the Southside,

622
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:47,133
but we both know the truth.

623
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:49,594
Snakes don't shed
their skin so easily.

624
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:51,930
Good night, FP.

625
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,556
Now get the hell
out of my neighborhood.

626
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,058
You're still hot, Alice.

627
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,726
Too bad you're a stick
in the mud.

628
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,361
And all this time,
I thought you were a lover,
not a fighter.

629
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:08,738
I'm both.

630
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:10,740
I've got layers.

631
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,744
You were doing something nice,

632
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:16,871
it's just that sometimes,

633
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,875
when people do
nice things for me,
I short circuit.

634
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,418
Maybe I'm not used to it.

635
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:23,795
Maybe I'm scared.

636
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,298
Of getting hurt.

637
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:31,886
Or being rejected
for being myself.

638
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:36,391
I should have told you
about Chuck.

639
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,018
But I lied.

640
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:44,524
And instead I threw you
this party that you
didn't even want.

641
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:47,110
Why did you?

642
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:53,700
Something is very,
very wrong with me.

643
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,869
Like there's
this darkness in me

644
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,330
that's overwhelming
sometimes,

645
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,708
and I don't know
where it comes from.

646
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:05,336
But I think that's what makes
me do these crazy things.
Like...

647
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:43,541
How am I ever
gonna look anyone
in the eye ever again?

648
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,960
By Monday,
this will all be but a dream.

649
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:49,505
Trust me.
No one will remember anything.

650
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:52,175
Except maybe that I accused
Cheryl of twincest.

651
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:57,889
I drunk-dialed my dad, Ronnie.

652
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,057
Archie.

653
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:01,976
What did you say?

654
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,896
I told him not to sign
the divorce papers.

655
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,190
I don't even know why,

656
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:09,067
it's not like I even want them
to get back together.

657
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:13,279
Veronica,
why do I keep doing this?

658
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:14,864
I keep wrecking things.

659
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,240
Welcome to my life.

660
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:21,162
Every day, I feel
like there's a new secret,

661
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,247
a new lie
about my parents

662
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:24,415
and what they've done.

663
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:29,587
I don't want
my mom to be guilty, Archie.

664
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:32,673
I really want that
to be a lie.

665
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:36,427
Do you ever wonder...

666
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:39,972
What if you had
done things differently,

667
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,308
what if you had made
different choices?

668
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:43,893
What do you mean,
different choices?

669
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:45,436
Every day I wonder,

670
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:47,772
what if I had left Riverdale
with my mom?

671
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,940
Would things be...

672
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,984
Would I be better off?

673
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,237
I can't answer that, Archie,

674
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:55,947
but we wouldn't have met,

675
00:35:56,155 --> 00:36:00,118
and that would've been
a tragedy of epic proportions.

676
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,830
I'm messed up, Veronica...

677
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:05,456
We all are, Archie.

678
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:09,210
And, honestly,
you less than most.

679
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:37,006
Veronica. Hey, good morning.

680
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,553
Morning, Jughead.

681
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:47,642
Um...

682
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,726
So listen...

683
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:52,063
Don't... Don't worry,
my lips are sealed.

684
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:54,857
Okay. Cool.

685
00:37:57,735 --> 00:38:01,697
Smithers, you've known
my parents a very long time,
haven't you?

686
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:04,242
Oh, my, yes, ages.

687
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:09,163
And would you describe
my father as a good man?

688
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:11,666
I'd rather not say, miss.

689
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:16,379
And my mother, is she...

690
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:18,130
Unequivocally good.

691
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,133
No doubt in my mind
about that.

692
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:23,010
Thank you, Smithers.

693
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:30,518
- Veronica.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

694
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:36,774
And thank you, Mom,
for not getting mad
that I slept over at Betty's.

695
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:39,402
Thank you for coming.

696
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,320
I believe in you, Mom.

697
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,869
And I'm ready to go on record

698
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:50,871
about how much
my mom and dad love me.

699
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:59,672
Long night's journey into day?

700
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:06,679
I can't face the music
right now.

701
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,389
Yeah, I understand.

702
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:11,600
So, you and Veronica...

703
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:14,729
Yeah...

704
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,273
- Jug...
- Don't worry.

705
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:20,067
I'm never telling anyone
anything literally ever.

706
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,277
Okay, good.

707
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,280
Thanks. That's great.

708
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:32,163
I brewed some High Point

709
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:35,249
and brought you some aspirin
for the headache
I'm sure you have.

710
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,500
Thanks, Mom.

711
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,797
So I saw that you
invited Jughead's dad

712
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:44,175
to your little
soiree last night.

713
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:47,303
I did.
I thought it would be nice.

714
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:51,140
And he was talking
to a long-haired delinquent
wearing a leather jacket.

715
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:52,933
- You mean Joaquin?
- Is that his name?

716
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:55,394
They know each other
through the Serpents.

717
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:56,812
He's kind of dating Kevin.

718
00:39:57,021 --> 00:39:57,813
What?

719
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:01,609
A Southside Serpent
dating the Sheriff's son?

720
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:05,654
This is a small town,
but it's not that small.

721
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:12,411
Hi there.

722
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:17,166
Decaf skim latte
and a fresh scone.

723
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,668
The last time
you brought me baked goods

724
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:21,420
was because you kissed Archie.

725
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:27,885
Betty...

726
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:31,722
I just testified
on my father's behalf

727
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:34,892
and helped his chances
of going free.

728
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:37,144
That's good news, right?

729
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:43,442
My dad hired Jughead's dad
to trash the drive-in.

730
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,612
And given recent events,
it's not inconceivable

731
00:40:46,821 --> 00:40:50,408
that he might've hired him
to do other jobs.

732
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:55,496
Like go after Jason
as payback for what
the Blossoms did to him.

733
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,253
I want to help
with your investigation.

734
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:04,630
I want the truth.

735
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:06,882
Whatever it is.

736
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:11,178
<i>Whether you believe
in order or chaos,</i>

737
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:13,264
<i>in the end, it's the same...</i>

738
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,266
<i>We are either
in control of our lives,</i>

739
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:17,268
<i>or merely think we are.</i>

740
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:18,394
Miss Veronica.

741
00:41:20,688 --> 00:41:21,856
Package arrived for you.

742
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,000
Archie.

743
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:44,170
We're home.

744
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:47,965
Mom?

745
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:50,050
Hi, honey.
