ARCHIE: <i>Previously on</i> Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,772 --> 00:00:05,250
JUGHEAD: <i>The story is about a
town, once wholesome and innocent,</i>

3
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:08,343
<i>now forever changed by the
mysterious murder of Jason Blossom</i>

4
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:09,521
<i>on the 4th of July.</i>

5
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:12,097
- Can we talk, Ms. Grundy?
- About what?

6
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,175
<i>You're the music teacher.
Can we talk about music?</i>

7
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:15,344
(GUNSHOT IN DISTANCE)

8
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:17,906
We heard what we heard, and
afterwards we didn't do anything!

9
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:22,328
How would we explain why we were
together at 6:00 a.m. on the 4th of July?

10
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:26,044
Polly and Jason dated,
and Jason hurt Polly.

11
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:29,692
Oh, my God, Jason. He was shot.

12
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:32,458
Jason's death is now being
treated as a homicide.

13
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:37,425
They'll find out soon
enough. That I'm guilty.

14
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,427
JUGHEAD: Guilt, innocence.

15
00:00:43,063 --> 00:00:44,796
<i>Good, evil.</i>

16
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:46,965
<i>Life, death.</i>

17
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:50,236
<i>As the shadows around
Riverdale deepened,</i>

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,439
<i>the lines that separated these polar
opposites blurred and distorted.</i>

19
00:00:56,335 --> 00:00:59,169
<i>"I'm guilty," Cheryl
said in Biology class.</i>

20
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:01,179
<i>But of what?</i>

21
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:02,806
To clarify,

22
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:06,318
I didn't mean I was
guilty of killing Jason.

23
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:09,051
I loved him more than I do myself.

24
00:01:10,586 --> 00:01:12,086
But I am guilty

25
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:15,556
of lying about what
happened on July 4th.

26
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:18,730
The autopsy puts his
death about July 11th.

27
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:21,032
When was the last time
you saw your brother?

28
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:22,500
It was July 4th.

29
00:01:22,503 --> 00:01:25,470
I don't know what happened
the week after that, but...

30
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:29,574
Cheryl, in your own words, what
happened at Sweetwater River?

31
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:32,510
The plan was bananas, even for me.

32
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:36,214
<i>Jason wanted to leave
Riverdale and never come back.</i>

33
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:38,216
<i>He asked for my help to
stage a tragic accident,</i>

34
00:01:38,218 --> 00:01:41,003
<i>so that our mom and dad
wouldn't come after him.</i>

35
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:44,244
<i>Our story would be, we went
for an early morning boat ride,</i>

36
00:01:44,247 --> 00:01:47,415
<i>and the boat tipped, and
capsized, and Jason drowned.</i>

37
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:51,416
<i>In fact, we made it to the
other side dry as bones.</i>

38
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,994
<i>We said goodbye on the Greendale
side of Sweetwater River.</i>

39
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,371
<i>He promised he'd call me as
soon as he was in a place</i>

40
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:01,814
<i>where he couldn't be reached
or pulled back by our parents.</i>

41
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,617
<i>One month, at the most.</i>

42
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,625
Every day, I waited for
him to call, for an email.

43
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:08,391
You tell anyone about the plan?

44
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,068
Any way that you can corroborate it?

45
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,885
And you have no idea why your
brother wanted to run away,

46
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,334
fake his own death?

47
00:02:16,857 --> 00:02:18,790
Doesn't that seem cruel?

48
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:21,493
No, he wasn't... Jason wasn't cruel.

49
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:23,728
So maybe this is all just a web of lies

50
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,263
you're spinning to
cover your own tracks.

51
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:26,698
I didn't kill Jason!

52
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:31,836
There was a gunshot that morning.
We heard a gunshot on July 4th.

53
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:34,305
Maybe whoever killed
Jason took a shot at him,

54
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:35,573
and missed that morning.

55
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:38,454
You heard a gunshot, and
you're just telling us this now?

56
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:40,779
I was upset. My brother was murdered.

57
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:45,283
So upset that you sang and
danced at a pep rally yesterday.

58
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:47,852
- (DOOR SLAMMING)
- What the hell is going on here?

59
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:50,255
- CHERYL: Mommy.
- Don't say another word, Cheryl.

60
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,957
Get up. Why didn't you call us?

61
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,872
CLIFFORD: Because
she's a liar, Penelope.

62
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,242
When we get home, you're
telling us everything.

64
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:13,878
Hot off the presses.

65
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:16,347
Mom.

66
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:20,819
First you leak Jason Blossom's
autopsy report, and now this?

67
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:22,320
People are loving the coverage.

68
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:26,024
You have to stop sensationalizing
this horrible thing.

69
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:28,760
It's news, Betty. We own
the <i>Riverdale Register.</i>

70
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:31,296
We have a responsibility
to keep the people informed.

71
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:36,238
Whatever Jason did to
Polly, he's still a person.

72
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:37,302
You reap what you sow.

73
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:39,904
You should be writing
about the real story.

74
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:42,388
What happened to Jason?

75
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:45,243
Who was holding him
captive? Why was he frozen?

76
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:47,245
And who shot that gun on July 4th?

77
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:49,414
Well, if you are so keen on reporting,

78
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,516
why don't you come work
with your father and me?

79
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,926
The <i>Register</i> could really
use a Lois Lane type like you.

80
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:15,703
I think I know something that can
help with the Blossom investigation.

81
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,310
People are saying
Cheryl heard a gunshot?

82
00:04:19,313 --> 00:04:21,240
That's what she's claiming, yes.

83
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:25,049
I heard it, too.

84
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:26,651
I was there that morning.

85
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:28,961
I didn't say anything because at first,

86
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:31,625
like everyone, I thought
Jason had drowned.

87
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:34,685
But then when the autopsy came
out and said he died later...

88
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:37,786
What were you doing down at
the river so early on July 4th?

89
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:41,466
Um, working on some songs.

90
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:44,056
I, uh...

91
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:46,280
Write songs.

92
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,631
- Did you see who fired the shot?
- No, sir.

93
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:50,964
Were you alone?

94
00:04:53,346 --> 00:04:54,546
No, sir.

95
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:56,414
Who were you with?

96
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:00,851
Let's make it a 4th of
July you'll never forget.

97
00:05:00,854 --> 00:05:02,686
(GUNSHOT IN DISTANCE)

98
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:04,489
My dog, Vegas.

99
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,993
So, are you a suspect now?

100
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:11,496
My dad says we all are, including me.

101
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:13,665
Not me, girl. I don't know these people.

102
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:18,451
Guys, should we maybe re-binge
<i>Making a Murderer</i> on Netflix tonight?

103
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:21,556
Sorry. Can't. Gotta stay
late to work on the paper.

104
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:22,525
Count me out, too.

105
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:25,242
- I've got a date tonight.
- You do?

106
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:27,445
Which Riverdale hottie made the cut?

107
00:05:27,448 --> 00:05:29,013
Hey, Vee-Lo.

108
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:31,015
I'll swing by the Pembrooke
to pick you up at 8:00?

109
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:32,215
I'll be waiting.

110
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:33,418
Cool.

111
00:05:35,956 --> 00:05:38,555
- Chuck Clayton?
- You're going on a date with Chuck?

112
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:40,291
He's kind of a player.

113
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:42,994
Who cares? He's the hottest of hot,

114
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:44,862
and he's the varsity
football coach's son.

115
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:47,865
In Riverdale, that's
like dating a Kennedy.

116
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:54,173
If print journalism is
dead, what am I doing here?

117
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:58,443
The <i>Blue and Gold</i> isn't dead,
Juggy. It's just dormant.

118
00:05:58,446 --> 00:06:00,087
But waking up.

119
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:02,647
You're writing a novel, right?

120
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,443
About Jason Blossom's murder?

121
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:06,117
I am.

122
00:06:06,853 --> 00:06:09,153
Riverdale's very own <i>In Cold Blood.</i>

123
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:12,256
Which started out as
a series of articles.

124
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,932
I'm hoping you'll come write
for the<i> Blue and Gold.</i>

125
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:20,999
I just don't think the school
paper's the right fit for my voice.

126
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:22,600
(GROANS) Juggy...

127
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,638
Jason's death changed Riverdale.

128
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:31,053
People don't want to admit that,
but it's true. We all feel it.

129
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:36,214
Nothing this bad was ever supposed
to happen here, but it did.

130
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:38,478
I want to know why.

131
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,885
Would I get complete freedom?

132
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:44,933
I'll help, and edit...

133
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:48,960
And suggest. But it's your
story, it's your voice.

134
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:53,965
Doesn't sound like
complete freedom, but...

135
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:56,330
I'm in.

136
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,682
Okay great! Um, in that case,
I have your first assignment.

137
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:05,165
There's one person who was at the river
on July 4th that no one's talking about.

138
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:07,702
- Dilton Doiley and his Scouts.
- Exactly.

139
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:15,620
Hey.

140
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:18,089
I texted. Where were you?

141
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:20,422
Football practice. Then I was writing.

142
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:22,794
Songs?

143
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:24,785
Your music?

144
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:28,466
I thought you and Jughead
were on a road trip on the 4th.

145
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:30,635
Then I talked with Sheriff Keller.

146
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:33,337
So, guess that was a lie.

147
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:39,444
- Dad, we were gonna go, but...
- You should have come to me, Archie.

148
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:41,252
We could've gone to
the Sheriff together.

149
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:43,188
I didn't want to drag you into it, Dad.

150
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:44,558
That was an error in judgment.

151
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:46,451
Sorry, Dad. Sorry I'm not perfect.

152
00:07:46,453 --> 00:07:47,998
You know, you're pretty
far from perfect

153
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,654
lately, Archie. That's
why you're grounded.

154
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:50,988
What? Are you serious?

155
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,058
So, in this house, every
night for two weeks, 7:00.

156
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,107
You want some alone time
with your music? You got it.

157
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,656
I'm not 10 years old, Dad!
You can't just...

158
00:07:57,658 --> 00:07:58,921
You wanna go for three?

159
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:06,704
CHUCK: Okay, okay, let me
try again. Let me try again.

160
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:08,412
- VERONICA: Let me see it.
- CHUCK: You don't trust me?

161
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:09,874
VERONICA: No, no, no,
fine. You can take it.

162
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:12,443
Okay, let me see. Photo approval.

163
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,415
Fine.

164
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:19,383
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

165
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:23,221
You are different than
what I thought you'd be.

166
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:28,196
A former It Girl from New York,
made off like a fall from grace?

167
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,743
I assumed you'd be high maintenance.

168
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:35,291
Now tell me, what do
you miss most about home?

169
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:37,569

- He's lying.
- About what?

340
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:12,530
The gunshot. It was him.

341
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:14,982
He was teaching us how to shoot targets.

He's a hardcore survivalist.

345
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:26,857
He says if we don't protect
ourselves, no one will.

That's the real question. What exactly
you expect to get out of this experience.

00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:59,004
Short version. I just want to
hear you guys play my songs.

write songs for the Pussycats?

363

And where did you get those
thigh-high boots? They're amazing.

383

Trev told Valerie, who told Josie, who
told Ginger, who told Tina, who told me.

384
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:34,451
And I thought I would help out.

385
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:36,386

even bother to hide it.

and Chuck think about women.

We're objects for them to abuse.

And when they're done with
us, they shame us into silence.

for the lives they destroy.

681
00:38:37,328 --> 00:38:39,796
<i>Needed to make an example of someone.</i>

682

684

Next time, <i>mija,</i> you come to me first.

685
00:38:48,473 --> 00:38:51,007
You don't take matters
into your own hands.

and his goon squad, from the team.</i>

688

691
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:12,695
Thanks, Betty. Thanks, Veronica.

692
00:39:12,698 --> 00:39:15,731
Thank you, Ethel, for
going on the record.

693
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:17,934
It made all of the
difference with Weatherbee.

694
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:20,557
You're the bravest of
them all, Ethel Muggs.

<i>and survived.</i>

701
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:56,572
Whoever killed Jason hurt him.

702
00:39:57,704 --> 00:39:59,589
Maybe Jason hurt people, too.

703
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:02,578
If he hurt Polly, I'm sorry.

704
00:40:15,493 --> 00:40:17,026
(GASPS) Archie?

705
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:20,930
I, uh...

706
00:40:22,478 --> 00:40:24,611
I wanted to thank you
for talking to my dad.

707
00:40:24,614 --> 00:40:26,669
I meant what I told him.

708
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:29,539
I think it could really happen for you.

709
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:36,078
So...

710
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,997
Does this mean we can

711
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,553
start our lessons back up again?

JUGHEAD: <i>We crave absolutes.
They comfort us,</i>

713
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,460
<i>but life is infinitely
more complex than that.</i>

714
00:40:51,714 --> 00:40:55,591
If you publish a story saying I fired
that gun, my life will be ruined.

715
00:40:55,594 --> 00:40:57,700
I'll be banished from
the Adventure Scouts,

716
00:40:57,702 --> 00:40:59,769
and charged with a misdemeanor.

717
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:02,905
So, what if I have a better story?

718
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,011
If I tell you what I know, promise
me the gunshot stays between us.

719
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,850
You have our word. As journalists.

720
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:19,622
I saw something at Sweetwater River.

721
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,490
Something nobody else saw.

722
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:24,927
Ms. Grundy's car.

723
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,629
By the river's edge.

724
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,733
She was there.

<i>But Dilton Doiley had
just opened Pandora's box,</i>

728
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:44,647
<i>and now, there was nothing I,
or anyone, could do to save him.</i>
