00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:02,754
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:05,966
<i>The story is about a town,
once wholesome and innocent,</i>

3
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:09,135
<i>now forever changed
by the mysterious death
of Jason Blossom</i>

4
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:10,512
<i>on the 4th of July.</i>

5
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:13,473
The bookkeeping position
at my company...
It's still open.

6
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:15,809
- If you're interested...
- Yes, yes, yes.

7
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,227
Oh, Hiram.

8
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:19,646
A donation to your
re-election campaign.

9
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,440
And Lodge Industries gets
one of the most prime

10
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:24,484
pieces of real estate
in Riverdale.

11
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,112
What did Jason do
that was so bad?

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,738
Jason and Polly had a fight.

13
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:31,032
Afterwards, Polly was
pretty devastated,

14
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:32,784
so we sent her to a hospital.

15
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:35,745
If your parents lied
about Jason and Polly,

16
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:37,580
there's probably more
that they lied about.

17
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:40,500
Dad, Jason and Polly
were engaged.
Did you know that?

18
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,545
I'd die before I let them
steal my daughter.

19
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:46,131
- Where is she?
- She is sick!

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,094
<i>Fear.</i>

21
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:54,681
<i>It's the most basic,
the most human emotion.</i>

22
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:59,519
<i>As kids, we're afraid
of everything.</i>

23
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:03,481
<i>- The dark...</i>
- Will you stay in my room
tonight, Polly? Please?

24
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,443
<i>The boogeyman under the bed...</i>

25
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,362
Mom won't let me, Betty.

26
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:11,072
But I'll turn
the night-light on, okay?

27
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:16,995
<i>And we pray for morning.
For the monsters to go away.</i>

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,170
<i>Though they never do.
Not really.</i>

29
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:27,422
<i>Just ask Jason Blossom.</i>

30
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,883
Oh, Mom, I forgot to mention.

31
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,093
I invited Jughead
over for breakfast.

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,929
Hmm.

33
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:51,279
So, Jughead...

34
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:54,783
I suppose we have you
to thank for Betty's
ongoing obsession

35
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,743
with this Jason Blossom
ghoulishness?

36
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,746
Actually, Mom, I was the one
who asked Jughead

37
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:02,082
to help me write it
for the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

38
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,377
Relax, Betty.
I'm just making conversation.

39
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:14,636
Do you guys have a bathroom
I could use?

40
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:17,180
- Sure, I'll show you.
- No, no. I'll show him.

41
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,724
Follow me...

42
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:21,643
Jughead.

43
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:39,577
<i>Another fun fact about fear.</i>

44
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,746
<i>Sometimes it grows up
with you.</i>

45
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,548
<i>Or it curls up inside of you,</i>

46
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:53,716
<i>tightens around your guts.</i>

47
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:56,553
Archie Andrews?

48
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:01,307
<i>Each fall,
Riverdale High hosts
a Variety Show.</i>

49
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:03,393
<i>But this event
is no mere student frolic.</i>

50
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,186
And what will you be
auditioning with?

51
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:10,150
Uh, an original song
that I wrote called <i>I'll Try.</i>

52
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,068
Try harder!

53
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:13,903
Maybe try not sucking so much.

54
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:24,372
Take your time, Archie.
Though we do have
people waiting.

55
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:29,711
Oh, my God, what's happening?

56
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,796
He's choking.

57
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,215
Archie? Clock's ticking.

58
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,468
Excuse me. Sorry, I gotta go.

59
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:51,482
When I was up there,
looking out...
I don't know, I just I froze.

60
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,359
That was stage fright, Archie.

61
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:56,946
Yeah, but when
I'm on the football field,
the stands can be packed.

62
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:59,866
- Packed, and it doesn't affect
my game at all.
- Singing makes you vulnerable

63
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,243
in a way
that football doesn't.

64
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:06,164
Or maybe what I was missing
out there onstage was my team.

65
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,124
Or at least a partner.

66
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,710
What if we sang <i>I Got You?</i>

67
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,296
Archie, I'm a Pussycat.

68
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,714
We're headlining
the Variety Show.

69
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:17,342
What if you sang with them
first and then me?
Just this once?

70
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,970
- To help me get my sea legs.
- Have you met Josie?

71
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,224
I can't step out on the Cats.

72
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:31,022
"The Sisters
of Quiet Mercy."

73
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:35,568
What is that? Like a church?
Or a charity?

74
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,115
No. It's a...

75
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:44,369
"Home for troubled youths.

76
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:49,290
"Where disenfranchised teens
will learn such virtues
as discipline and respect,

77
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:53,586
"enjoying lives
of quiet reflection
and servitude."

78
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,798
Poor Polly.

79
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:01,803
It's been months.

80
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:05,098
There's gotta be a reason
my mom and dad don't want
me to see Polly.

81
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,557
But I don't care anymore.

82
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:09,894
What are you guys
talking about?
Anything I can help with?

83
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:12,647
What we're attempting
is a stealth operation,
Archie.

84
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,941
If we go in there
with the entire Scooby Gang,

85
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,734
forget it, we're compromised.

86
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:20,280
Well, don't you have to
practice for the Variety Show
anyways?

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,158
Uh, no, I don't.

88
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:28,371
Except that yes, you do.
Thanks to a certain
Veronica-ex-machina.

89
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,290
- Excuse me.
- What do you mean?

90
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:33,626
Oh, nothing. Just that
I had a few words
with our director/host,

91
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:36,629
and reminded him
that he's heard you sing
on numerous occasions.

92
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,048
Even though it compromises
my artistic integrity.

93
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:42,302
Cutting to the chase,
you have a slot
if you want it.

94
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,054
Veronica, thank you,
but you saw what happened.

95
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:46,139
We all did.

96
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,516
Playing my songs
in front of you guys
is one thing,

97
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:51,436
but getting back up
on that stage by myself...

98
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,022
I'm not sure if I'm ready
for that.

99
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,982
If it's a partner
you're looking for,

100
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,151
Veronica Lodge
is more than willing and able.

101
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,153
Veronica, I didn't know
you could sing.

102
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,362
Like a nightingale.

103
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,990
What do you say, Archiekins?

104
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,867
Be the Jay to my Bey?

105
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,879
<i>♪ Oh, when the sun goes down
we light up this town</i>

106
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,506
<i>♪ Let your voice get loud ♪</i>

107
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,884
Hold up, hold up. Look, Val.

108
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,552
You don't sing on the bridge.

109
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:27,472
Actually, the bridge
is meant to be sung
by two voices.

110
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:29,182
What is up with you today, J?

111
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,725
What is up with you
today, Mel?

112
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,101
You're asleep
at the snare drum...

113
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,394
Relax.

114
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:36,481
Josie, it's a Variety Show
in the auditorium,

115
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:39,108
not show time at the Apollo.

116
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:43,404
Whether you are performing
at Madison Square Garden
or Ace Bowling Alley,

117
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,948
you do it at 150%.

118
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,536
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,165
Did you want to say something
to me, Valerie?

120
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,753
It's just that I don't have
to deal with this diva crap
when I'm working with Archie.

121
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:02,131
Working with Archie how?

122
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:05,134
Co-writing songs.

123
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,512
- Singing with him.
- Unacceptable.

124
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,305
You sing with the Pussycats.

125
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,307
Or with Archie.

126
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:12,683
But not both.

127
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:16,771
In that case, I quit.

128
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,607
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out.

129
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:38,042
How's the, uh,
first day going?

130
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,086
Um...

131
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,798
It's your books, Fred.

132
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:47,802
You only have enough
in the bank to cover
three more weeks of payroll.

133
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:52,807
I just don't want to... I...
I can't let my guys go.

134
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,643
Last time I fired someone,
it was not good.

135
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,271
I trust those guys, you know.
They trust me.

136
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,981
That's worth everything.

137
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,150
Yeah, but...

138
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:04,777
I mean...

139
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,364
Even putting your business
at risk?

140
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,492
I'm waiting to hear
on this huge bid.

141
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,162
It's a long shot, but...
You know that new development

142
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,663
where the old drive-in
used to be?

143
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:17,748
I'm thinking that
the construction

144
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,959
could actually put me
back in the black.

145
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:24,213
If I knew who the buyer was,
I would plead the case myself.

146
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,132
So, I'm gonna do
the next best thing.

147
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,094
Mayor McCoy is handling
all the arrangements
for the buyer.

148
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:31,846
So, I invited her to dinner.

149
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:35,766
Figure I can try to woo her
into giving me the contract.

150
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,393
So, I was thinking...

151
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:40,480
Maybe you could be my co-host.

152
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,524
Yeah. I mean, of course.

153
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:45,443
Good.

154
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,321
Actually, why don't we
have the dinner at my place?

155
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:52,867
It's nicer. No offense.

156
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,904
Hey, I just wanted to
let you know,

157
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,949
I, uh... I bought tickets
for all the guys at work
to come see you

158
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,242
in the Variety Show.

159
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:38,162
Yeah, me and Hermione...
We're gonna go together.

160
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:39,956
With each other. I...

161
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,542
I don't really know
how to say this,

162
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,627
and I don't want to
make a too big a deal of it,
but, uh...

163
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,504
Dad, it's okay. You're good.

164
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,297
Yeah?

165
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:50,299
- Yeah.
- Good. Okay.

166
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,176
I do like her, and I...

167
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,053
You know,
I think maybe I'm ready...

168
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,598
If this is something
that makes you happy,
then I say go for it.

169
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:03,145
You're good.
Mom's good. I'm good.

170
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,066
All right.

171
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,696
Mom,
Valerie quit the Pussycats.

172
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:15,950
- Replace her.
- Val writes our songs.
She's irreplaceable.

173
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:20,204
No, Josie.
You're irreplaceable.

174
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,957
Everyone else is disposable.

175
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,210
You know, maybe it's not
such a bad thing
to try a new voice.

176
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:27,461
- Ugh.
- A different sound.

177
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,005
You know how your father
feels about pop music.

178
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:30,631
- But it's not pop music
this time.
- Okay,

179
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,718
well, he's catching a red eye
and missing two concert dates

180
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,344
to see you
in this Variety Show.

181
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:37,346
I would hate for you
to let him down.

182
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:38,973
I understand, and I won't.

183
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:42,059
Good, 'cause if you do,
he will somehow blame me.

184
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:46,397
Find yourself a new Cat.
Someone skinny and beautiful.

185
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:50,943
But not more skinny
and beautiful than you.

186
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,112
And a woman of color, please.

187
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:56,032
- Josie, don't forget
our branding.
- Yeah, okay. Mmm.

188
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,491
And Josie...

189
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,161
Don't disappoint.

190
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,012
Are you gonna leave Dad
when he gets out of jail?

191
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:22,141
Honey, why would you ask
such a thing?

192
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,726
I saw you, Mom.

193
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,021
With Fred Andrews
in the trailer.

194
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:31,734
Oh, Veronica.

195
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:36,155
Honey, I am so sorry
that you did.

196
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,910
But I want you to know
that we've... We've never
even kissed before.

197
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,328
Until today.

198
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,996
What about Dad?

199
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:47,291
What happens when he
comes home?

200
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,591
I'm not sure.

201
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,220
I'm so sorry, baby.

202
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,432
It just happened, Veronica.

203
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,436
And I know that this
must be confusing.

204
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:10,022
Yeah, it is.

205
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,401
So, what can I do to help?

206
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,368
You know what, Mom?
There's actually nothing.

207
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,417
<i>♪ I've got you</i>

208
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,919
<i>♪ And you've got me</i>

209
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:34,296
<i>♪ I've got you</i>

210
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,757
<i>♪ And you've got me ♪</i>

211
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:41,554
Not to be that girl, Archie,

212
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,141
but I didn't get the memo
we were adding another voice
to the mix.

213
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:48,394
Ronnie, hey. Great news!
Valerie quit the Pussycats.

214
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:54,650
So, that makes me what, then?
Backup?

215
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,111
No. I mean, you were
just doing it as a favor
to me, right?

216
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,490
You are unbelievable, Archie.

217
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:05,828
You literally have
zero loyalty,
you ginger Judas!

218
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,705
Okay. Hey, Ronnie.
What's wrong?

219
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:12,001
What's wrong, Archie,
besides the fact that you have
no integrity whatsoever,

220
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,087
is that your father
kissed my mother.

221
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:17,506
Um...

222
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:20,760
- Maybe I should leave.
- No, hold on. Hold on.

223
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,595
When my dad told me
how he felt,

224
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,472
it seemed like they were both
really into each other.

225
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,224
They're married
to other people.

226
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,351
Hey, my mom and dad are
separated and your dad is...

227
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,687
My dad is what?

228
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,191
He's...
He's incarcerated, right?

229
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,067
That is so not the point,
Archie!

230
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,195
Of course not. Of course not.
I'm sorry. You're right.

231
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:42,114
Do you wanna talk about it?
We can go somewhere and talk.

232
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,366
Or do you want your part back?

233
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,619
Oh, don't do me any favors,
Archie.

234
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:47,703
Veronica...

235
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,211
Your hunt for a new Pussycat
is over.

236
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,254
I can sing, and I've got
a lot of aggression

237
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:59,215
that needs channeling
into something positive.

238
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:50,808
Hey.

239
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:56,397
Don't judge
a home for troubled youths
by its facade, right?

240
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,362
Hi. My name is
Elizabeth Cooper.

241
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:04,738
I'm here to see
my sister, Polly.

242
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,408
May I see some identification?

243
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,289
Sign in here, please.

244
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:15,082
He'll have to wait.

245
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,169
Polly's room
is right this way.

246
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,964
Though right now
it's silent reflection time,

247
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:25,676
and she usually spends
that time in the Garden
of Deliverance.

248
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:52,912
Polly?

249
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:58,459
Betty. Oh, my God.

250
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,298
You found us.

251
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:07,217
You're...

252
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,772
Polly... You're...

253
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,524
With Jason's...

254
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:27,154
- Please be happy
for me, Betty.
- I am, Polly.

255
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,115
I'm just...

256
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,661
I am so sorry
I didn't come sooner.

257
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,038
- I should've, but Mom
and Dad... They stopped...
- No.

258
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,623
What did they tell you?

259
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,209
That I was on drugs? Alcohol?

260
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,919
They said you were sick.

261
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:45,714
That you tried
to hurt yourself.

262
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:50,052
And they told me you didn't
want to come and see me,
which I knew was a lie.

263
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:54,056
So, they locked you up
because you're pregnant?

264
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,350
It's because they couldn't
control me, Betty.

265
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:01,105
Mom and Dad hated
that Jason and I were dating.

266
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,315
They were thrilled
when Jason dumped me.

267
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,069
Jason's parents forced him
to break up with me.

268
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:10,906
Of course they didn't approve
of a Blossom boy dating
a Cooper girl.

269
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,409
But when I told him
about the baby,

270
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,452
our baby...

271
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,997
Oh, he was so happy,
Betty.

272
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,500
We were gonna run away.
Start our family
in a beautiful place.

273
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,169
So, on July 4th,

274
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:27,589
<i>I woke up, I packed a bag,</i>

275
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,717
<i>and I went downstairs
to start my new life.</i>

276
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,677
<i>Just like Jason and I
had planned.</i>

277
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,929
<i>We were gonna meet
on the other side
of Sweetwater River.</i>

278
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,558
But Mom and Dad found out
about everything.

279
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,352
<i>When I went downstairs,
there was a woman
I didn't know</i>

280
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,396
<i>sitting at the kitchen table
drinking tea</i>

281
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,649
<i>- with two men behind her.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

282
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:47,568
<i>They threw me
in the back of a van.</i>

283
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,446
<i>I was screaming.</i>

284
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:53,490
I don't think I stopped
screaming until I got here,
in this place.

285
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:57,703
Have you talked to him?

286
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,705
Does he know that I'm here?

287
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,876
- Who, Polly?
- Jason.

288
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,879
If I give him a message,
will you make sure
it gets to him?

289
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,635
- Polly, Jason...
- What does he think happened?

290
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:16,138
He knows that I'm here
because of Mom and Dad, right?

291
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,473
Polly, you don't understand...

292
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,767
I can fix this, Betty.
I know I can.

293
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,020
You just have to help me
get out of here,
and then I'll go to meet him.

294
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,481
I'll go to the car
on the lost highway
off of Route 40.

295
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:26,982
"Once you pass the old
maple syrup sign,

296
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,442
"then you'll know
you're almost there."

297
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,986
See? I remember.
I'm packed. We're packed.

298
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,946
We'll go to the farm
just like we planned...

299
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,823
Polly, stop.

300
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,826
What's the matter, Betty?

301
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,703
What? What is it?

302
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:43,290
Jason...

303
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,460
What?
Did something happen to him?

304
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,214
Something bad?

305
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:55,302
Oh, my God.

306
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,972
Oh, my God!
I knew it.

307
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,600
He's... He's...

308
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,269
- He's...
- I'm sorry.

309
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,188
I'm sorry, Polly.

310
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,023
Come with me, young lady.

311
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,274

Poor little rich girl.
What do you have
to be stressed out about?

318
00:19:35,134 --> 00:19:36,760
We're doing a cover
of a disco song,

319
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:39,930
and my dad is skipping
Jazz Fest to hear it...

320

Okay, well, I'm sorry
you have daddy issues,

321

but at least your father
can be in the same room

322
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:49,439
I haven't seen my dad
in three months
because he's in jail.

323

Veronica.

327
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,627
I'm sorry about your dad.

00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,920
I met Josie and Melody
when we were all working
at Power Records.

341
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:54,922
We used to practice
in the stock room.

342
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:59,051
I'll never forget the day
Josie came to rehearsal

343
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,470
with a bag of cheap cat ears
from the Halloween Store.

344
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,182
I found my voice with them.

345
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,908
Mom?

346
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,118
What are you doing here?

347
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,540
I pay the Sisters good money.
You think they don't notify me
if Polly gets a visitor?

348
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,807
- Mom?
- Polly...

349
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:51,311
Jason's dead?
And you didn't tell me?
And you kept me in here?

350
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,854
Baby, it's for your own good.

351
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,524
Ugh! You always say that.
And it's not true!

352
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,317
No! Betty!

353
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,903
I'm gonna get you out of here,
I swear to God.

354
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,114
- I love you, Polly.
- No!

355
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,214
So, Myles, you being
a professional jazz man,

356
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,674
you must be livin'
your dream, right?

357
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,968
Well, yes and no.

358
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:26,805
The real struggle
is always art versus commerce.

359
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:29,474
You know, I've never really
been about the big paycheck.

360
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,894
But if we're talking
about the future
and long-term security,

361
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:36,064
it can't always be about
following your bliss.

362
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,900
Personally, I'm just excited
to see my daughter perform

363
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,069
with the Pussycats
at the Variety Show.

364
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,779
- Oh, yeah.
- I beg your pardon?

365
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,281
When were you
gonna tell me about this?

366
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:48,618
It just happened, Dad,
and she's...
She's really, really good.

367
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:50,746
And Val quit.

368
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,706
Or should I say
we were Yoko Ono'd?

369
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,751
- Really?
- Yeah.

370
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:59,087
That's unfortunate.
She was the real deal.

371
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,673
Gave your act
some much-needed integrity.

372
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:05,218
Well, I figure as long as
the kids are havin' fun,
that's the point, right?

373
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:09,306
Except it's more than
just about being fun for us.

374
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,767
- Isn't it, Josephine?
- Josephine?

375
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,562
I didn't know
that was your real name.
After Josephine Baker.

376
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,399
You have no idea
who that is, do you?

377
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:22,402
- Fred? You wanna get started
on that presentation?
- Yeah.

378
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:27,574
Polly needed
to hear the truth.
And I did, too.

379
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:28,742
So?

380
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,912
Did you find
what you were looking for?

381
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,832
To be honest, Dad,
no, I didn't.

382
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:40,420
You hate the Blossoms.

383
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:44,758
You hated Jason,
and now Polly is pregnant
with his baby.

384
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:48,261
That gives you a motive.

385
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,223
"A motive"?
A motive for what?

386
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,016
The night of the drive-in,

387
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:58,063
did you break
into Sheriff Keller's house
and steal his case files?

388
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,732
- What?
- You weren't at the drive-in.

389
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:03,985
You weren't with Mom
when she put Ms. Grundy
on trial. Where were you?

390
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,404
Betty,

391
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,698
what do you think I did?

392
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:14,371
Did you kill Jason Blossom?

393
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:27,926
Him?

394
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:35,225
You think that
he killed Jason?
Your father?

395
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:38,437
- You think that he has
the stomach for that?
- Alice...

396
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,856
I wish he'd killed Jason.

397
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,651
I wish I had after what Jason
did to Polly.

398
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:49,156
I swear, Elizabeth,
you're sounding crazy
just like your sister.

399
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:54,536
- Stop staying that, Mom.
She's not crazy...
- She is, Betty.

400
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,329
She...

401
00:24:56,496 --> 00:25:00,709
Okay, she is depressed
and delusional.

402
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:05,005
Did you actually believe
the story she told you?

403
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:10,177
About running off
to Never-Never Land
and raising a family?

404
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,180
That's a fantasy, Betty.

405
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:16,224
I don't believe you.
You don't
have to believe us.

406
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,269
We're your parents.

407
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:35,243
And with the labor force
coming from Riverdale,
Andrews Construction

408
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,204
would be stimulating
the local economy.

409
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,498
It's a win
for the entire town.

410
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,374
That's it in a nutshell.

411
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,376
Well...

412
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,420
After all that
salt-of-the-earth talk,

413
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:49,132
I didn't expect you to be
another dollar-chasing
gentrifier.

414
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:53,803
Myles, Fred Andrews
is a working man
who lives in the real world.

415
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:58,350
I think Fred's bid
was refreshing.

416
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:01,853
In fact, I'd like
to award him the contract.

417
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,483
I'd like to, Fred,
but the buyer's
already in the process

418
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:08,151
of accepting another bid.

419
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:11,947
It would take two
shareholder signatures
to stop the process.

420
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:19,454
Pop music isn't jazz.

421
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:21,957
Beyonce
is not Josephine Baker.

422
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,459
- It's an impossible target
to hit, and I keep trying...
- Right...

423
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:26,086
...but he just... I'm...

424
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:29,881
Anyway, what's your sob story?

425
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,259
Nothing so glamorous.

426
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:38,431
I caught my mom
and Fred Andrews
in an intimate moment.

427
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,183
Are you gonna tell your dad?

428
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:45,146
Josie, the only thing
that keeps me going right now

429
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,566
is the thought of how,
when he gets out of jail,

430
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:51,695
we can all be together again.
And we can go back
to the way things were.

431
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:54,739
- Mmm.
- And If I tell my dad
about my mom,

432
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,117
that just all goes away.

433
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:01,663
Maybe. Maybe not.

434
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:04,583
- You don't know my father...
- Yeah, but I know
dysfunctional families.

435
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,503
I'm not sayin'
that what your mom's
doing is right,

436
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:12,799
but maybe there's another side
to the story.

437
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:16,553
- Hmm?
- Maybe one worth hearing?

438
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:23,310
Dad, if I tank at the Variety
Show, would you...

439
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:24,978
Would I be mad?

440
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:30,567
Son, whatever happens
at that show, or any show,

441
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,402
whether you go
up there and kill it

442
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:35,155
or you bomb
like electric Dylan
at a folk concert...

443
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,907
I'm not sure who that is.

444
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,787
I would still love you, okay?

445
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,039
Support you.

446
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,708
I'd be proud of the fact
that you were brave enough

447
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,960
to go after somethin'
that you care about.

448
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:02,390
I can't wait to see your debut
as a Pussycat, Ronnie.

449
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,225
- Mom, I've been thinking...
- Truly.

450
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,853
Meanwhile, I was wondering
if you could help me
with something.

451
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:09,898
- Are those divorce papers?
- No.

452
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,650
Ronnie, it's a motion.

453
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,193
To award
the construction contract

454
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,986
on your father's land
to Fred Andrews.

455
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:17,572
I know you're not
his biggest fan right now,

456
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,325
but I was hoping
you would sign it.

457
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:22,535
Why would I need to sign it?

458
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:30,377
When your father was arrested,
we made you a legal officer
of Lodge Industries.

459
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,462
Surprise!

460
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:35,924
And two out of three
signatures are needed
to award the contract,

461
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:39,260
which your father
wants to give
to a less than legit outfit.

462
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,472
And you want my help
giving it to your boyfriend.

463
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:46,976
I was gonna apologize to you.

464
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:53,441
If I sign that, will you stop
seeing Fred Andrews?

465
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,611
Ronnie, I can't agree to that.

466
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:03,034
In that case, Mom,
I'm sorry, but no.

467
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:06,121
However you're rationalizing
what you're doing
with Archie's dad,

468
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:07,747
I don't want any part of it.

469
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,196
It's so perfect
when you play it.

470
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:41,573
We wrote a good song, Archie.

471
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,953
I can't wait to sing it
with you in public.

472
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:49,456
But just not tonight.

473
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:51,833
Val, you should play
with the Pussycats.

474
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,960
I don't want to be the guy
that broke up The Beatles.

475
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,297
In your heart,
you're a Pussycat.

476
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,175
You'll always be a Pussycat.

477
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,177
Maybe.

478
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:07,140
But singing backup
with no vote, no agency...

479
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:09,392
- Well, after meeting
Josie's dad...
- Myles is in town?

480
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:12,604
- Yeah.
- That's why she's been acting
like Catzilla.

481
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,314
I'm betting you can negotiate
new terms.

482
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:15,648
Where does that leave you?

483
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:20,862
I was born alone.
I'll die alone.
I'll sing alone.

484
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,280
I'll be okay.

485
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,842
Hey there, Juliet.

486
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,260
Nurse off duty?

487
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:48,723
You haven't gone full
<i>Yellow Wallpaper</i> on me yet,
have you?

488
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:52,268
They're crazy.

489
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:54,938
My parents are crazy.

490
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,940
They're parents.
They're all crazy.

491
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:59,943
No, but what if...
What if Polly is, too?

492
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:04,864
The way she was talking to me,
the way she looked at me...

493
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:08,117
And now, all I can think is,
"Maybe I'm crazy
like they are."

494
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:09,869
Hey.

495
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,454
We're all crazy.

496
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,750
We're not our parents, Betty.

497
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,878
We're not our families.

498
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,341
Also...

499
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:26,427
What?

500
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:31,432
What?

501
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:48,283
The car.

502
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:51,995
Wow. That's what you're
thinking about in the middle
of our moment?

503
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:56,207
No! Polly talked about a car
Jason had stashed for them

504
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,460
down Route 40 near some sign.

505
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:03,131
If we can find it,
we can confirm Polly's story.

and welcome to the 75th
annual Variety Show!</i>

509
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:22,567
Why didn't you tell me
your dad was coming?

510
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,819
Would it have
made a difference?

511
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:27,614
Um, yes.

512
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:29,949
Josie, I'm not singing
with Archie tonight.

513
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:35,663
Sorry to hear that,
but you know I filled
your spot, Val.

514
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:38,082
Yes...

515
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:43,004
And I also know the new girl
may be pretty,

516
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:47,508
but no way does
her voice blend with yours
like mine does.

517
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,515
I suppose...

518
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,562
There's always room for one
more kitty in my litter box.

519
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:01,481
- But Josie...
- Yeah?

520
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:03,191
Every now and then,
I want to sing lead.

521
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:07,654
Co-lead.
And only on the bridge.

522
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:09,030
Fine.

523
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,034
