00:00:01,294 --> 00:00:02,712
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

2
00:00:03,213 --> 00:00:05,966
<i>The story is about a town,
once wholesome and innocent,</i>

3
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:09,302
<i>now forever changed
by the mysterious murder
of Jason Blossom</i>

4
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:10,679
<i>on the 4th of July.</i>

5
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:13,223
- Can we talk, Ms. Grundy?
- About what?

6
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,058
<i>You're the music teacher.
Can we talk about music?</i>

7
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:18,812
We heard what we heard,
and afterwards
we didn't do anything!

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,233
How would we explain why we
were together at 6:00 a.m.
on the 4th of July?

9
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:26,987
Polly and Jason dated,
and Jason hurt Polly.

10
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:30,532
Oh, my God, Jason.
He was shot.

11
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:33,618
Jason's death is now being
treated as a homicide.

12
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:38,540
They'll find out soon enough.
That I'm guilty.

13
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:43,461
<i>Guilt, innocence.</i>

14
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:45,839
<i>Good, evil.</i>

15
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,091
<i>Life, death.</i>

16
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:50,844
<i>As the shadows around
Riverdale deepened,</i>

17
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:55,473
<i>the lines that separated
these polar opposites
blurred and distorted.</i>

18
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:59,978
<i>"I'm guilty," Cheryl said
in Biology class.</i>

19
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:02,230
<i>But of what?</i>

20
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:03,690
To clarify,

21
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:07,235
I didn't mean I was guilty
of killing Jason.

22
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:10,196
I loved him more
than I do myself.

23
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,866
But I am guilty

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,745
of lying about what
happened on July 4th.

25
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,873
The autopsy puts his
death about July 11th.

26
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,541
When was the last time
you saw your brother?

27
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,501
It was July 4th.

28
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,463
I don't know what happened
the week after that, but...

29
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:30,592
Cheryl, in your own words,
what happened at
Sweetwater River?

30
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:33,511
The plan was bananas,
even for me.

31
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:37,182
<i>Jason wanted to leave
Riverdale and never come back.</i>

32
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,350
<i>He asked for my help
to stage a tragic accident,</i>

33
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,644
<i>so that our mom and dad
wouldn't come after him.</i>

34
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,190
<i>Our story would be,
we went for an early
morning boat ride,</i>

35
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,276
<i>and the boat tipped,
and capsized,
and Jason drowned.</i>

36
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:52,238
<i>In fact, we made
it to the other side
dry as bones.</i>

37
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:55,950
<i>We said goodbye
on the Greendale side
of Sweetwater River.</i>

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,330
<i>He promised he'd call me
as soon as he was in a place</i>

39
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,665
<i>where he couldn't be reached
or pulled back by our parents.</i>

40
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:04,250
<i>One month, at the most.</i>

41
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:07,670
Every day, I waited for him
to call, for an email.

42
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,380
You tell anyone
about the plan?

43
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:10,882
Any way that you can
corroborate it?

44
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,261
And you have no idea
why your brother
wanted to run away,

45
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,471
fake his own death?

46
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:19,891
Doesn't that seem cruel?

47
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,602
No, he wasn't...
Jason wasn't cruel.

48
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,854
So maybe this is all
just a web of lies

49
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:26,356
you're spinning to
cover your own tracks.

50
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,732
I didn't kill Jason!

51
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,821
There was a gunshot
that morning. We heard
a gunshot on July 4th.

52
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:35,115
Maybe whoever killed Jason
took a shot at him,

53
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,241
and missed that morning.

54
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:39,160
You heard a gunshot,
and you're just
telling us this now?

55
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,746
I was upset.
My brother was murdered.

56
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:46,417
So upset that you
sang and danced at
a pep rally yesterday.

57
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:49,003
What the hell is
going on here?

58
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:51,381
Mommy.
- Don't say another
word, Cheryl.

59
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:54,050
Get up. Why didn't
you call us?

60
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,802
Because she's
a liar, Penelope.

61
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,012
When we get home,
you're telling us
everything.

62
00:02:58,036 --> 00:03:06,036
Subtittle By | SupunWe |

63
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:14,529
Hot off the presses.

64
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:16,990
Mom.

65
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:21,703
First you leak
Jason Blossom's autopsy
report, and now this?

66
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,371
People are loving
the coverage.

67
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:27,167
You have to stop
sensationalizing
this horrible thing.

68
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,878
It's news, Betty.
We own the <i>Riverdale Register.</i>

69
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:32,046
We have a responsibility
to keep the people informed.

70
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:38,303
- Whatever Jason did to Polly,
he's still a person.
- You reap what you sow.

71
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:41,097
You should be writing
about the real story.

72
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:43,349
What happened to Jason?

73
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:46,352
Who was holding him captive?
Why was he frozen?

74
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,354
And who shot that gun
on July 4th?

75
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:50,523
Well, if you are
so keen on reporting,

76
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,567
why don't you come work
with your father and me?

77
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:55,403
The <i>Register</i> could really use
a Lois Lane type like you.

78
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:16,674
I think I know
something that can help with
the Blossom investigation.

79
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,345
People are saying
Cheryl heard a gunshot?

80
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,180
That's what she's
claiming, yes.

81
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,059
I heard it, too.

82
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,685
I was there that morning.

83
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:32,607
I didn't say anything because
at first, like everyone,
I thought Jason had drowned.

84
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:35,443
But then when the autopsy came
out and said he died later...

85
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:38,821
What were you doing
down at the river so early
on July 4th?

86
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,492
Um, working on some songs.

87
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:45,161
I, uh...

88
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:47,205
Write songs.

89
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,667
- Did you see
who fired the shot?
- No, sir.

90
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,126
Were you alone?

91
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:55,630
No, sir.

92
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:57,465
Who were you with?

93
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,386
Let's make it a 4th of July
you'll never forget.

94
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:05,515
My dog, Vegas.

95
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:10,103
So, are you a suspect now?

96
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,397
My dad says we all are,
including me.

97
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,857
Not me, girl.
I don't know these people.

98
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:19,320
Guys, should we maybe
re-binge <i>Making a Murderer</i>
on Netflix tonight?

99
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:22,282
Sorry. Can't. Gotta stay late
to work on the paper.

100
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,533
Count me out, too.

101
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,119
- I've got a date tonight.
- You do?

102
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,246
Which Riverdale hottie
made the cut?

103
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,081
Hey, Vee-Lo.

104
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,791
I'll swing by the Pembrooke
to pick you up at 8:00?

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,917
I'll be waiting.

106
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:34,294
Cool.

107
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:38,881
- Chuck Clayton?
- You're going on
a date with Chuck?

108
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,384
He's kind of a player.

109
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,845
Who cares?
He's the hottest of hot,

110
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:45,972
and he's the varsity
football coach's son.

111
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,641
In Riverdale, that's like
dating a Kennedy.

112
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:55,189
If print journalism is dead,
what am I doing here?

113
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:59,569
The <i>Blue and Gold</i> isn't dead,
Juggy. It's just dormant.

114
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,195
But waking up.

115
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:03,573
You're writing a novel, right?

116
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,199
About Jason Blossom's murder?

117
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:06,951
I am.

118
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:10,246
Riverdale's very own <i>In Cold Blood.</i>

119
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:13,291
Which started out
as a series of articles.

120
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm hoping you'll come write
for the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

121
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:22,091
I just don't think
the school paper's
the right fit for my voice.

122
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,718
Juggy...

123
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,722
Jason's death
changed Riverdale.

124
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:32,352
People don't want
to admit that, but it's true.
We all feel it.

125
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:37,231
Nothing this bad was ever
supposed to happen
here, but it did.

126
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:39,442
I want to know why.

127
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:41,903
Would I get complete freedom?

128
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:45,490
I'll help, and edit...

129
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:49,994
And suggest.
But it's your story,
it's your voice.

130
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:54,999
Doesn't sound like
complete freedom, but...

131
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,293
I'm in.

132
00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:01,547
Okay great!
Um, in that case, I have
your first assignment.

133
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:05,927
There's one person who was
at the river on July 4th
that no one's talking about.

134
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:08,471
- Dilton Doiley
and his Scouts.
- Exactly.

135
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:16,396
Hey.

136
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,315
I texted. Where were you?

137
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,401
Football practice.
Then I was writing.

138
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:23,528
Songs?

139
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,030
Your music?

140
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:29,826
I thought you and Jughead were
on a road trip on the 4th.

141
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,577
Then I talked
with Sheriff Keller.

142
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:34,372
So, guess that was a lie.

143
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,545
- Dad, we were gonna go, but...
- You should have
come to me, Archie.

144
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,130
We could've gone
to the Sheriff together.

145
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,132
I didn't want to
drag you into it, Dad.

146
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,425
That was an error in judgment.

147
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,468
Sorry, Dad.
Sorry I'm not perfect.

148
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:50,721
You know, you're pretty far
from perfect lately, Archie.
That's why you're grounded.

149
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,014
What? Are you serious?

150
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:55,059
So, in this house, every
night for two weeks, 7:00.

151
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,103
You want some alone time
with your music? You got it.

152
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,397
- I'm not 10 years old, Dad!
You can't just...
- You wanna go for three?

153
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,822
Okay, okay, let me
try again. Let me try again.

154
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,323
- Let me see it.
- You don't trust me?

155
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:10,992
No, no, no, fine.
You can take it.

156
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,494
Okay, let me see.
Photo approval.

157
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,082
Fine.

158
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:24,213
You are different than what
I thought you'd be.

159
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:28,759
A former It Girl from
New York, made off
like a fall from grace?

160
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,513
I assumed you'd
be high maintenance.

161
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,184
Now tell me, what do you
miss most about home?

162
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:38,478
Only everything.

163
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,939
I forgot how exhausting
it is to be the new kid.

164
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:46,652
Try being the new kid whose
dad is also the new teacher.

165
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,112
And the new coach.

166
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,574
Well, from an outsider's
point of view,

167
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,451
you've not only
proven yourself,

168
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,454
but you've raised the bar
for everyone around you.

169
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:59,457
Varsity football, Dean's List.

170
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,167
Ivy League aspirations.

171
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:03,836
Oh, yes, you've been
vetted handsome.

172
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,756
Veronica Lodge is nothing
if not an informed consumer.

173
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:11,344
I'm gonna have my
hands full with you, huh?

174
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:14,013
I'm betting you can handle it.

175
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,861
Why did you tell them
about the gunshot?

176
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,405
They were gonna crucify
Cheryl. I had to help her.

177
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,407
You were in the clear.
We were in the clear.

178
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:36,035
I left your name out of it.
So it's not that big a deal.

179
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:39,622
No big deal, Archie?
You are caught up
in a murder investigation.

180
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,917
What if Sheriff Keller
decides to keep digging,
and it somehow leads to us,

181
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,795
- to our relationship?
- I'll stick to my story.
I'll protect you.

182
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:50,132
I'm suspending our lessons.

183
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:52,093
What?

184
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,471
So, how'd it go with Chuck?

185
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,598
Chuck has muscles for days,
but his conversation

186
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:00,518
is not the stuff
of Oscar Wilde,
or even Diablo Cody.

187
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,771
Hey, Veronica.
How was the Sticky Maple
you had last night?

188
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,899
- The what now?
- The Sticky Maple
Chuck gave you?

189
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,192
How was it?

190
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:11,070
We had a brownie sundae,
if that's what you
hyenas mean.

191
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:17,618
- Oh, my God.
- What?

192
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:22,707
What the hell
is a Sticky Maple?

193
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:26,335
It's kind of what
it sounds like.
It's a Riverdale thing.

194
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:29,255
No, Kevin, it's a
slut-shaming thing.

195
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:32,675
And I'm neither a slut,
nor am I going to be shamed

196
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,803
by someone named, excuse me,
Chuck Clayton.

197
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,306
Does he really think
he can get away with this?

198
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:39,765
Does he not know who I am?

199
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,768
I will cut the brakes on
his souped-up phallic symbol.

200
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:44,729
Or we can go to
Principal Weatherbee.

201
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:47,023
About the coach's son?
Who is captain of
the football team,

202
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,983
and Riverdale High's
resident golden boy?

203
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,028
Or I can expose him in the
pages of the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>
Yeah, I can do that!

204
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,947
No. Spoken like a
true good girl who
always follows the rules.

205
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:59,702
Well, I don't follow rules,
I make them, and when
necessary, I break them.

206
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,079
You wanna help me get
revenge on Chuck,
Betty, awesome.

207
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,498
But you better be willing
to go full dark, no stars.

208
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,167
What do you say, in or out?

209
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:16,135
Excuse me.

210
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:19,639
Veronica?

211
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:21,891
Betty, what are
you guys doing here?

212
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,143
Don't worry about it.
I mean it, Andrews.

213
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:26,270
Hit the showers
and stay out of my way.

214
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:35,029
- Huh, B and V.
Menage a right on. Ladies.

215
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:38,574
This is disgusting.
Take it down.

216
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,077
Whoa, whoa. Why are
you so wound up?

217
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,328
It's a badge of honor,

218
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:46,248
and you're not exactly
virgin territory after your
closet date with Andrews.

219
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:49,710
Okay, that's beyond
irrelevant, Chuck. You're not
allowed to go around

220
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,173
humiliating girls,
for any reason, under any
circumstances, you jerk.

221
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,051
Look, I get you're
not a closet kind
of girl, but hey,

222
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,178
if you wanna ride
the Chuck Wagon,
that can be arranged.

223
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:05,518
Let's keep this simple,
so that your preppy-murderer
half-brain can grasp it.

224
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,769
Take.

225
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,729
This. The hell.

226
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:10,731
Down.

227
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:16,362
Okay, that high-toned bitch
attitude may have
worked on the betas

228
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,907
you dated in New York, but
you're in Bulldog territory.

229
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,829
But please, fight back.

230
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,793
You'll only make it
harder on yourself.

231
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,093
<i>And in that
moment of hesitation,</i>

232
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:43,389
you're dead.
All of you are dead.

233
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:46,892
At ease, Doiley.

234
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:49,854
I'm writing an article
for the <i>Blue and Gold.</i>
Hoping you can help.

235
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:52,148
Dismissed.

236
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,150
But stay close.

237
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,905
Cheryl and Archie both say
they heard a gunshot
the morning of July 4th,

238
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,073
but they don't know who fired.

239
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:02,950
Sherriff Keller already
asked me about this.

240
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,412
And like I told him,
my Scouts and I, we didn't
hear anything weird.

241
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,625
Well, did you
see anything weird?

242
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:18,799
A white-winged crossbill.
A long-eared owl.

243
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:19,925
Oh.

244
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,221
And Cheryl, sitting by
the river, soaking wet.

245
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,769
Psst. Archie.

246
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:33,522
Thanks to you, Archie, I'm not
the girl who cried gunshot.

247
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,275
You believed me when
not even my parents did.

248
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,319
I just told the truth.

249
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,446
Which is why I want
to repay your kindness.

250
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,115
Cheryl, truly, that's not
why I came forward.

251
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:45,242
Save the, "Aw, shucks"
for Betty.

252
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,953
I'm granting you
one wish, Archie.

253
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,664
Nothing is off the table.

254
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,042
Except for my body.

255
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,129
Jason would want you
to be rewarded.

256
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,344
Actually, there is one thing.

257
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,476
Hey, Josie.

258
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,896
I love my girl Cheryl,
so I am doing her this solid.

259
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,818
She said that you needed help
with your music since
Ms. Grundy bailed on you.

260
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:23,322
The Pussycats are
playing my mom's event,
The Taste of Riverdale,

261
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:25,908
and we are rehearsing
every night this week.

262
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,036
Come. Observe.

263
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:30,996
Learn.

264
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:37,086
This week I'm, uh,
I'm grounded.

265
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,632
Yeah, okay, not your problem.
I'll make it work.

266
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:42,758
Okay.

267
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,219
Thank you.

268
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,949
Hey, I've been
meaning to ask.
How was your date last night?

269
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,492
I like the looks of that boy.

270
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,829
The more handsome
on the outside, the more
rotten on the inside.

271
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,748
What's that supposed to mean?

272
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:17,251
Nothing, just that
he's not really my type.

273
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,381
This is Betty. Can I take it?

274
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,424
Yeah.

275
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,217
Hello?

276
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,184
This story is bigger
than we thought.

277
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:37,938
I started asking around,
to see if what happened to you
happened to anyone else,

278
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:39,607
and if anyone would
go on record.

279
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:44,445
- I will. 100%.
- Okay.

280
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,365
It's five guys
on the football team.
Chuck and his posse.

281
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,159
Ethel was about to tell us...

282
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:56,457
One day last year,
Chuck and I talked in
the library for 10 minutes.

283
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:01,045
I helped him
with a Pre-Cal problem,
and nothing happened.

284
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,381
But the next day, he...

285
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:10,262
He started telling people that
I let him do stuff to me.

286
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,598
Like, sex stuff.

287
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:14,975
And then he...

288
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:19,688
Or one of his goons,
wrote, "Sloppy seconds"
on my locker.

289
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,232
Yes, yes, we've all heard
your tragic origin story.

290
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:25,986
I'm so, so sorry, Ethel.
That's horrible.

291
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:29,823
Not as horrible as being
a suspect in your own
brother's torture-murder case,

292
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,825
but we all have our crosses.

293
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:35,454
In the meantime, River Vixen
practice starts in five
minutes, sluts, so...

294
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:38,457
They're ruining our lives,
and to them it's just a game.

295
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:43,837
- They keep score and...
- Wait, what do you mean,
keep score?

296
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,006
Each conquest earns
them points.

297
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,133
They keep track
in some secret playbook.

298
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,387
Okay, we have to talk
to Weatherbee.

299
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,263
I already tried.

300
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:55,516
Weatherbee said that
he didn't find anything.

301
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,351
Okay, we need
undeniable proof.

302
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,437
Proof of what, Nancy Drew?
That boys will be boys?

303
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,691
And that playbook reeks
of suburban legend.

304
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,359
How would you know, Cheryl?

305
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:06,694
Because, Frida Shallow,

306
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:10,364
before he died, my brother
was co-captain of
the football team with Chuck,

307
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,909
and Jason never
mentioned it, and he never
would've allowed it.

308
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:16,787
Okay, well, I never
met your brother,

309
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,748
but I'm not lying about
what happened to me.

310
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,458
And Ethel's not lying.

311
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:25,379
And proof or no proof,
book or no book,

312
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:29,550
I am going scorched earth
on these privileged,
despicable miscreants.

313
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,635
You wanna get caught
in that backdraft, Cheryl?

314
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,599
Call me, or any of these
beautiful, young, strong,
intelligent women...

315
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,144
"slut"

316
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,023
one more time.

317
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,492
Right. Yeah, I'm gonna take
care of the check, all right.

318
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:56,618
Save me some.

319
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,294
- What the hell, man?
- I saw the way
you looked at me.

320
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:07,755
During Grizzly training.

321
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:11,091
You're hiding something.

322
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,510
It's Scoutmaster Doily.

323
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,388
- He's lying.
- About what?

324
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,348
The gunshot. It was him.

325
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,768
He was teaching us
how to shoot targets.

326
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:27,775
Dilton Doiley shot
the gun on July 4th?

327
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,902
He's a hardcore survivalist.

328
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,154
He says if we don't protect
ourselves, no one will.

329
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,419
Melody's our technique queen.

330
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:48,796
And you're the songwriter?

331
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:50,839
I would love to...

332
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,383
Love to what?

333
00:18:55,844 --> 00:19:00,474
That's the real question.
What exactly you expect
to get out of this experience.

334
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,561
Short version.
I just want to hear
you guys play my songs.

335
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,438
Making them better.
Recording them.

336
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:11,443
So, you feel
qualified to write songs
for the Pussycats?

337
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:13,987
Yeah.

338
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,907
- For divas of color?
- No.

339
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:19,701
Maybe, maybe.

340
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:24,123
Look, this isn't LA or
New York, this is Riverdale,

341
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:28,627
and people's minds are
opening up, but do you
have any idea

342
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,880
how much hate mail my mom got
when she was elected mayor?

343
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,674
I campaigned for
your mom, I get it.

344
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,260
No, no, no, baby, you don't.

345
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,345
I mean do you know why
we're called the Pussycats?

346
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:43,809
Because we have to claw
our way into the same rooms
that you can just waltz into.

347
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,978
So, if you think that you
can write my experience...

348
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,771
- Josie?
- It's okay, Valerie.

349
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,315
She's right.

350
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:52,526
Good.

351
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:57,823
Ethel.

352
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,451
Betty, you know
Trev Brown, right?
Valerie's brother?

353
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,662
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

354
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,706
He used to be on
the football team.

355
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:07,708
But I quit.

356
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,586
When I saw Chuck's playbook.

357
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,171
And I may know where it is.

358
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:17,092
Football players behaving
badly, what else is new?

359
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:18,886
Steubenville, Glen Ridge.

360
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:22,806
The coach's son being
the ringleader. I mean, just
how depraved is this town?

361
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,391
Color me impressed.

362
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,186
A B and E with B and V.

363
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,897
What would your holy roller
mother say about this, Betty?

364
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,356
What are you
doing here, Cheryl?

365
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:34,776
And where did you get
those thigh-high boots?
They're amazing.

366
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:38,906
Trev told Valerie, who told
Josie, who told Ginger,
who told Tina, who told me.

367
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:39,907
And I thought
I would help out.

368
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,367
Help? Or derail
our investigation?

369
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:43,827
Get over yourself, Betty.

370
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:45,204
Hey guys, get in here.

371
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:56,590
Trev was right.
They didn't even
bother to hide it.

372
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,431
New girl? Is that
what I'm reduced to?

373
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,227
- Nine points?
- Better than "Big girl."

374
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:09,811
Seven point five.

375
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,232
Polly's in this book...

376
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:16,902
Next to Jason's name.

377
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:22,199
I'm so sorry, Betty.

378
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:28,247
- This isn't...
Jason would never...
- It's right there, Cheryl!

379
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:32,709
God.

380
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,836
Your brother hurt my sister.

381
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:39,466
This is what guys like Jason
and Chuck think about women.

382
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,469
We're objects
for them to abuse.

383
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,930
And when they're done with us,
they shame us into silence.

384
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,474
They have zero remorse
for the lives they destroy.

385
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,811
Maybe I don't know Jason.

386
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:01,863
I'll take a picture.
We'll show it to Weatherbee.

387
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,491
It'll be the perfect cover
for your expose, Betty.

388
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:09,496
Yeah, but... No. These girls
deserve justice, don't
you think, Cheryl?

389
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,500
You want vengeance?

390
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:18,005
You wanna go full dark,
no stars, Veronica?

391
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,715
I'm with you.

392
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:22,634
And I have a plan.

393
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:31,727
Val, you are such a poet,
but these lyrics,

394
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:35,981
they don't make sense.
What is the hook? I mean,
I need a line that catches.

395
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,150
- I hear that.
- This...line.

396
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,777
- I've been struggling.
- What about,
"Paintings in the wind"?

397
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:44,573
How about,
"Paintings on her skin"?

398
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,451
I kinda dig that.

399
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,461
All right. Let's, uh,
take it from the top.

400
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:01,715
One, two, one, two, three.

401
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,347
<i>♪ Paintings on her skin
Colors in her hair</i>

402
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,725
<i>♪ Come around the corner,
make you stop and stare</i>

403
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:14,644
<i>♪ She don't pay no mind,
'cause she don't really care</i>

404
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:18,523
<i>♪ What you think about her,
think about her</i>

405
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,821
<i>♪ I don't care what
you want me to be</i>

406
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:32,162
<i>♪ 'Cause it ain't for you,
no it's all for me ♪</i>

407
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,752
That was... That was so good.

408
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,379
What else you got?

409
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:44,424
Uh, I was thinking
maybe we could invert
the second and third verses.

410
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:58,605
Seduce Scarlet doesn't
suit you, dear.

411
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,650
It's Polly's.
I'm borrowing it.

412
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:06,405
Polly grew up too fast.
I don't want you to make
the same mistake.

413
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:08,490
Well, I like it.

414
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:10,742
It makes me feel...

415
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:13,620
powerful.

416
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,838
You coming with us
to the Mayor's shindig?

417
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:24,965
No.

418
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,427
I'm going over to Veronica's
to study for a test.

419
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:32,556
I don't want you associating
with a girl like that.

420
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,435
A bad girl, you mean?

421
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,729
Get used to it, Mom.
She's my friend.

422
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,903
Here. Pink Perfection.

423
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,321
It's more you.

424
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:14,973
Hey, Chuck.

425
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:17,350
Can I sit?

426
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,061
Not if you wanna
discuss Veronica.

427
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:23,815
Only insofar as...

428
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,235
I've been thinking lately...

429
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,529
How I wanna be more...

430
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,490
like her.

431
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:33,783
You wanna be a bad girl?

432
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,328
Maybe.

433
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,788
Like your sister Polly was?

434
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,584
Oh, yeah, Jason told us
all about Polly.

435
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,670
You know, prissy prude by day,
freak in the sheets by night.

436
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,964
Bad girls have
more fun, right?

437
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,509
Yeah.

438
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:55,972
Maybe you can show me.

439
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,936
Yes. Yes, I...
I can do that. Um...

440
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:02,812
- When?
- Tomorrow night.

441
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,898
- Uh, your place or mine?
- Ethel's.

442
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,235
She and her
parents will be out.
She'll leave us a key.

443
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,320
We're friends.

444
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,822
And she has a pool...

445
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:15,325
And a hot tub.

446
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:19,621
I'll be there.

447
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:23,583
Definitely. Um.
Hey, and don't worry.

448
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,377
I'll be gentle.

449
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,463
- Can't wait.
- Hmm.

450
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:49,734
Welcome home, Ferris.
Sneaking out, breaking curfew.

451
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:51,611
Getting into fights.

452
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,823
Dad, don't freak out, okay.
I was with Josie, helping
the Pussycats with a song

453
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,033
they're doing at that
Taste of Riverdale thing.

454
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,704
- And I was hoping
you would let me go.
- No, Archie.

455
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:03,039
You don't get to go
wherever you want,
whenever you want,

456
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,624
and damn what
anyone else says.

457
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:09,045
Dad, this is the first time
a song I worked on is gonna be
performed in front of people.

458
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:12,257
On stage.
Please, let me go to this,

459
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,217
and then ground me for
the next six months, a year.

460
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:17,929
- We're not haggling over your
punishment, end of story.

461
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:18,888
Fine.

462
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:20,682
But you have to own it.

463
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:22,434
Own what?

464
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:25,645
Okay, if I had a football game
tomorrow night, would you
stop me from going?

465
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:31,610
No, because football you
understand. You respect.

466
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:35,488
But my music, since I told you
about it, you don't care.
You don't take it seriously.

467
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:39,367
This is not about my behavior.
This is about your behavior.

468
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:40,577
We're done here.

469
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,721
You're not Betty.

470
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:05,602
Betty and I talked it over,
and we decided it's time
to stop fighting over Archie,

471
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,313
and start learning to share.

472
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,030
- Nice.
- Isn't it?

473
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:19,908
It gets very, very hot.

474
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:24,579
Come on.

475
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,458
Let's get wet.

476
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,005
Uh, should we wait
for Betty to get here first?

477
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,066
Betty couldn't make it.

478
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,902
So she sent me instead.

479
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,996
<i>Welcome all, to the first
annual Taste of Riverdale.</i>

480
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:11,000
<i>As a lead-up to our
75th anniversary jubilee,</i>

481
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:16,089
<i>this event proves
that Riverdale truly
is a town that,</i>

482
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:20,593
<i>when tragedy knocks us down,
we get right back up!</i>

483
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,096
Bon appetit.

484
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,980
Well, well, well,
Hermione Lodge.

485
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:35,066
- Fred Andrews.
- You look like
you could use this.

486
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,944
May I try a blue cheese
slider, please?

487
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:39,362
Of course.

488
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:43,867
Hey, you're the music teacher
at the high school, right?

489
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:47,954
- Yeah.
- Hi, I'm Fred Andrews,
Archie's dad.

490
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:50,665
Can we talk?

491
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,755
Penelope? Clifford?

492
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,925
Hey. How are you holding up?

493
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:02,552
How do you think?

494
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:06,848
My son is dead, and neither
of you have done anything
to catch his killer,

495
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:08,808
except, of course,
harass my daughter.

496
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,853
Penelope Blossom. I thought
I might run into you.

497
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,480
Would you like to give me
a quote regarding the...

498
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:18,693
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. All right.
- How dare you, Alice Cooper!

499
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,945
Printing my son's autopsy?

500
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,909
He was tortured and shot,
and thrown in the river

501
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,119

Leave it. Leave it.

509
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:02,278
Are you sure it was worth
sneaking out for some
locally-sourced Munster?

510
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,030
I helped write that song, man.

519

I've heard
a lot about you.

520
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:32,517
Archie says you're great.
Very supportive.

521
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,937
That's very sweet of him.

522
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:38,481
I need you to tell me
the truth about something.

523
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:43,319
I know my son
has passion for music.
Does he have any talent?

524
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,738
See, I want to
be supportive,

525
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:48,074
but as a parent,
it's really hard to watch

526
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:50,076
your kid chase a dream
they may never catch,

527
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:52,203
when real-life opportunities
are passing them by.

528
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:54,622
Mr. Andrews, Archie...

529
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:57,876
He has talent. Unquestionably.

530
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,629
I'm not gonna lie to you.
He is coming to it late.

531
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,756
And he's got a lot
of catching up to do.

532
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:07,677
And there's an entire world
of competition out there.

533
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,556
Will he be able
to make a living at it?

534
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,852
It'd be a shame
if he didn't at least try.

535
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:20,648
<i>♪ Nothing can shake her... ♪</i>

536
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:22,150
You know, I gotta ask you.

537
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:25,612
What made you take such
an interest in my son?

538
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,452
Archie's a special kid.

539
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:41,127
<i>Okay, we're gonna do
something a little different.</i>

540
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:43,171
Hermione Lodge.

541
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:47,425
Park Avenue princess
to cater-waiter.

542
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:51,220
Alice Cooper. No longer
lactose intolerant, I see.

543
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:53,473
How's Veronica?

544
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,686
Oh. You don't even
know, do you?

545
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,398
The things that they're saying
about your daughter at school?

546
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,110
- What things?
- Slut-shaming.

547
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:09,656
That's what they call it
when sluts get shamed.

548
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,080
You know, you really
have to keep an eye
on girls like Veronica.

549
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:19,582
They so easily can
get out of control.

550
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:27,131
- What is that?
- Muscle relaxer.

551
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,510
Mix it with booze and it
lowers your inhibitions.
Hello, truth serum.

552
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:32,845
Maybe we should
slow it down a little?

553
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,640
It's fine. Right, Chuck?

554
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:41,187
You don't want to
slow down, do you?

555
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:44,190
Oh, I'm <i>2 Fast 2 Furious,</i>
baby.

556
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,025
Good.

557
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:47,986
Good boy, Chuck.

558
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,159
Hello, Dilton.

559
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,706
I talked to one
of your Scouts.

560
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:02,166
I know you fired the gun.

561
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:06,129
Which makes you both
a liar, and a public menace.

562
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:11,384
So what if I did?

563
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,303
I was doing
the Adventure Scouts a favor.

564
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:17,390
Somebody has to teach them
how to stand their ground.
The way this town is going...

565
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,225
Save it for your statement.

566
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,936
Which you can make
to Sheriff Keller, or to me.

567
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,604
I suggest the latter.

568
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,691
<i>Blue and Gold</i>
offices. Tomorrow.

569
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:40,079
What? What the hell?

570
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:41,622
Start recording.

571
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:44,792
Hey, guys. It's
really hot in here.

572
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,836
And getting hotter
by the minute.

573
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,422
Time to squeal, pig.

574
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,966
Tell the truth about
what happened between
you and Veronica.

575
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:55,219
We had a good time.
She had a good time.

576
00:34:55,428 --> 00:35:00,016
The truth, Chuck, or so help
me, I will boil you alive.

577
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,019
What?

578
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:05,396
- We made out.
- And then?

579
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,357
And then I took her home!

580
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:10,276
And I didn't give her
a Sticky Maple.

581
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,195
That is all you had
to say, you ass.

582
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:14,781
And now, everyone will know.

583
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,327
You like shaming
people, Chuck?

584
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:21,537
- Whoa, hey...
- You like
dehumanizing them?

585
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,457
- Okay!
- Prissy prude by day,
freak in the sheets by night?

586
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,626
- No!
- Apologize.

587
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:27,960
- Hey, get this...
- Calm down.

588
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:29,879
- Say you're sorry!
- Okay!

589
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,297
Okay, I'm sorry!

590
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:32,965
I'm sorry for all of it!

591
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:34,217
Good job, pig.

592
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:38,012
Now, time for your reward.

593
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:40,807
A Sticky Maple of your own.

594
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:42,058
Wait! What, what?

595
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:44,602
Apologize for ruining Polly.

596
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:48,272
- What the hell? Oh, my God!
- Do it, Jason!

597
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:50,358
Say you're sorry
for destroying me.

598
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:53,653
- Apologize for what
you did to me!
- Look, I'm not Jason!

599
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,072
- I'm not Jason!
- Betty, that is enough!

600
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,824
Stop, it's over!

601
00:35:58,032 --> 00:35:59,534
We did it. You did it.

602
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:02,078
You are crazy.

603
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:03,663
Oh, my God!
You're crazy as hell!

604
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,248
Betty?

605
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:08,626
I'm fine.

606
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:13,923
We're done here.

607
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:26,644
Dad?

608
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:32,859
Dad, what's going on?

609
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:36,737
Well, I am soundproofing
the garage.

610
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:41,576
I figure, you know, while
you're grounded, you
should at least be productive.

611
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,661
Practicing your music.

612
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:47,874
Dad, this is awesome.
Thank you.

613
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:52,253
I met your music teacher
last night. Yeah, Ms. Grundy?

614
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:55,965
Whoa. They did not look
like that in my day, son.

615
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,011
Ah, what were you
guys talking about?

616
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,138
You.

617
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:05,808
She believes in you, Archie.

618
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,394
So do I.

619
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,492
Quite the expose.

620
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,621
Whenever did you find
the time to write it?

621
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,373
Stayed up all night.

622
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,125
Couldn't sleep after...

623
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,544
Me neither.

624
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:35,630
Betty...

625
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,966
You came through for me,

626
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,886
in a way that no one
else ever has before.

627
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:44,055
But...

628
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,432
Can we talk about
what happened?

629
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,559
What do you mean?

630
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:52,396
The wig and everything.

631
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:55,900
How far were you
gonna take it?

632
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:59,070
- Chuck deserved it.
- You called him Jason.

633
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:06,494
- Know what? I didn't do that.
- Yeah, girl, you did.

634
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:10,581
You called yourself Polly.
It was like Dr. Jekyll,
Mistress Hyde.

635
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:12,583
You became another person.

636
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,128
Okay, I mean...

637
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:18,965
I remember saying Chuck
should apologize for Polly,

638
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:21,884
but not because I
thought he was Jason.

639
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:23,761
- Why then?
- Because...

640
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,556
I'm sick of guys like Chuck
and Jason doing horrible
things to girls like me,

641
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:30,059
you, and Polly. Okay?

671
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:36,811
I wanted to thank you
for talking to my dad.

672
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:38,938
I meant what I told him.

673
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,816
I think it could
really happen for you.

674
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:48,364
So...

675
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:52,910
Does this mean we can

676
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,830
start our lessons
back up again?

677
00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:00,042
<i>We crave absolutes.
They comfort us,</i>

678
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,671
<i>but life is infinitely more
complex than that.</i>

679
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:07,341
If you publish a story
saying I fired that gun,
my life will be ruined.

680
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,052
I'll be banished from
the Adventure Scouts,

681
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:12,054
and charged
with a misdemeanor.

682
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,182
So, what if I have
a better story?

683
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:21,272
If I tell you what I know,
promise me the gunshot
stays between us.

684
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:27,111
You have our word.
As journalists.

685
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:31,907
I saw something
at Sweetwater River.

686
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:33,784
Something nobody else saw.

687
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:37,037
Ms. Grundy's car.

688
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,914
By the river's edge.

689
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:42,793
She was there.

690
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:45,004
<i>Despite all of our
recent troubles,</i>

691
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:47,381
<i>I would've done anything
to protect Archie.</i>

692
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:51,093
<i>But Dilton Doiley had just
opened Pandora's box,</i>

693
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:56,849
<i>and now, there was
nothing I, or anyone,
could do to save him.</i>

694
00:41:56,873 --> 00:42:16,873
