1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,568
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,571 --> 00:00:02,958
You know that SoDale contract?

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,593
It was awarded to Andrews Construction.

4
00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:06,962
Mr. Andrews still doesn't
know that Daddy is the buyer?

5
00:00:06,964 --> 00:00:09,832
I asked around about those
bruisers going after your crew.

6
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:12,835
Pretty sure we both know
who has business in Montreal.

7
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:14,236
Hiram, why would he even...

8
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:16,909
Maybe he got a whiff of your
little romance with Freddy Andrews?

9
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:18,674
When my father got arrested,

10
00:00:18,676 --> 00:00:20,676
I made a pact to become a better person.

11
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:23,212
You're the bravest of
them all, Ethel Muggs.

12
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:25,114
You hate the Blossoms

13
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:27,549
and now Polly is pregnant with his baby.

14
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:28,951
Polly is moving home.

15
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:34,698
I will not be party to raising
a child that has Blossom blood.

16
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:37,110
Thicker than blood.

17
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:39,178
More precious than oil.

18
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:42,148
Riverdale's big business is maple syrup.

19
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,516
Since the town's founding,

20
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:46,786
one family has controlled
its lucrative syrup trade,

21
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:48,454
the Blossoms.

22
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:51,157
They were a part of the
fabric of our daily lives...

23
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,693
Rich or poor, old or young,

24
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:56,429
we consumed Blossom
syrup by the bucket.

25
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:59,975
That sickly, sweet
smell was inescapable.

26
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:06,172
The death of Jason Blossom
precipitated a crisis.

27
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:08,040
With the heir apparent gone,

28
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:10,643
who would inherit the
family business one day?

29
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:13,112
Certainly not Cheryl.

30
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,617
It was a question that brought
the wolves to Riverdale.

31
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,286
And now, the Blossoms
were circling the wagons

32
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,721
against possible attack,

33
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:23,823
from within their own ranks.

34
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:27,337
Polly won't answer my calls or e-mails.

35
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,662
I mean, I get that she
doesn't want to talk to my dad,

36
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:31,764
but what did I do wrong?

37
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:33,065
Nothing.

38
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,201
We'll figure it out.

39
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:36,803
Come here.

40
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:41,507
Up and at 'em, breakfast is ready.

41
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,675
I'm not hungry.

42
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:44,477
Oh, enough is enough, Elizabeth,

43
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,312
we have a big week ahead of us.

44
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,248
The Blossoms have always
been a thorn in our side,

45
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:51,884
ever since, according to
your milquetoast father,

46
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:53,319
Great-Grandpappy Blossom

47
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,521
killed Great-Grandpappy Cooper.

48
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:58,764
Well, it's about time
someone brings them to heel.

49
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:02,462
I'm writing a searing, no-holds-barred
takedown of their clan.

50
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:04,897
And you think that's
going to bring Polly home?

51
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,699
Maybe, maybe not,

52
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:08,501
but it'll make me feel better.

53
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,070
Word has it that the
Blossom board of trustees

54
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,707
has descended upon Riverdale
like a cabal of vampires.

55
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:17,009
Why? Now, that's a story.

56
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,611
I just need to find a way in.

57
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:22,181
The lawyers are coming over this week

58
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,684
to take our statements
for your dad's hearing.

59
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,687
We're both gonna have to
testify on your father's behalf.

60
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,756
What if they ask about what he did?

61
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,793
Embezzling all that money?

62
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:35,862
Am I going to have to lie?

63
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:39,499
Well... We might have to

64
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:43,402
shade the truth a bit, Ronnie.

65
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:44,968
Mom?

66
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:48,543
Baby, I have just made a mess of things.

67
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:52,712
Your father found out about Fred and me.

68
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:54,614
Someone went to him

69
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:56,349
before I got a chance to say anything...

70
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:58,351
Oh, my God, Dad knows?

71
00:02:58,353 --> 00:02:59,652
Yes, and on top of that,

72
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:02,021
the Blossoms are still
after the drive-in land,

73
00:03:02,023 --> 00:03:05,002
and Fred still doesn't
know that we own it.

74
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:08,661
Maybe it's time you tell
Mr. Andrews the truth.

75
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:11,063
And risk having him
walk off the project?

76
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,467
We've bet everything we have
on the SoDale construction.

77
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:15,968
Mom,

78
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,137
this is a small, gossipy town.

79
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,339
You need to tell Fred about the land

80
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:22,308
before someone else does.

81
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,283
Archie.

82
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:32,585
If music be the food of love,

83
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,754
play on, play on.

84
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:39,625
Did you know this
week's the official start

85
00:03:39,627 --> 00:03:41,027
of maple syrup season?

86
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:43,229
I... No, I didn't.

87
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,964
Well, it is.

88
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:47,900
And every year, we host
a tree-tapping ceremony,

89
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:50,503
a tradition that honors
the Blossom bloodline.

90
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:51,971
Our heritage.

91
00:03:51,974 --> 00:03:53,306
Sounds cool.

92
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:55,007
It is. Beyond.

93
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:58,277
It's also incredibly exclusive.

94
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,692
Family and inner circle only.

95
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:03,449
Wanna be my date?

96
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:08,454
The maple-tapping's something Jason and
I have done together since we could walk.

97
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:11,198
It was our extra-special thing.

98
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,960
But I...

99
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,428
I can't face it alone.

100
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:18,197
If you came,

101
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,799
as my escort,

102
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:22,390
I think I could get through it.

103
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:27,121
Cheryl, I would love to
help, but I have a girlfriend.

104
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:28,958
Maybe invite Kevin? Or Reggie?

105
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:31,477
You don't get it, do you?

106
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,046
I don't want Kevin or Reggie.

107
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,548
I want you.

108
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:38,050
You defended me to Sheriff Keller

109
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:40,152
when not even my parents would.

110
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,357
Never mind, I'm sorry I asked.

111
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,958
Cheryl, hold on.

112
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:53,238
"They put me in a wooden
box as I desperately opposed.

113
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:56,769
But all my screaming was for naught.

114
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,305
My mouth had been sewn closed.

115
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:03,231
Curled up in bed was just a girl.

116
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:05,945
Needing Daddy's arms to hold her."

117
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,383
Hey, Ethel.

118
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:15,921
I just wanted to tell you
how moved I was by your poem.

119
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:20,216
It felt like you were tapping
into something pretty dark,

120
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,994
but also pretty real.

121
00:05:21,997 --> 00:05:24,058
And I don't want to overstep...

122
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:28,104
But is everything all right, Ethel?

123
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:37,810
Things at home aren't great.

124
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,082
My mom and dad are fighting,

125
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:45,180
but they won't tell me about what.

126
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:50,222
It's like this really
bad thing is happening,

127
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,358
and there's nothing
that I can do to stop it.

128
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:55,234
Like you're trapped in
a slow-motion car crash.

129
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:57,614
Yeah, I know the feeling.

130
00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:59,765
Listen, Ethel.

131
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:02,501
It sounds like you
need some cheering up.

132
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:05,738
Which happens to be a
Veronica Lodge specialty.

133
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,839
So...

134
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,808
If you're free tomorrow,

135
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,976
come over for lunch and pampering.

136
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:14,313
Kevin will be there.

137
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:16,449
Yeah, come on, it'll be fun.

138
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:17,983
Just please say yes.

139
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:20,986
All right, sure.

140
00:06:20,988 --> 00:06:22,788
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

141
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,757
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.

142
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:28,260
So... What was that about?

143
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,397
Ethel's poem was a cry for help

144
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,531
if I ever heard one,

145
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,967
the likes of which I
vowed never to ignore,

146
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,001
not after...

147
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:38,804
Uh-oh. Do we need to sit down?

148
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:41,974
Okay, so, last year at Spence,

149
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:46,245
my best friend Katy and I kind
of terrorized this girl, Paige.

150
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:48,614
One time, we made her
drink gutter water.

151
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,182
Ew! Why?

152
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:51,851
Because she was there.

153
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:53,052
Because she was a misfit

154
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:55,287
and we were class-A brutal bitches.

155
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,922
Anyway, by December,

156
00:06:56,924 --> 00:06:58,224
Paige couldn't take it anymore...

157
00:06:58,226 --> 00:07:01,160
Oh, my God, did you
drive her to suicide?

158
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:02,361
What? No.

159
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:04,363
But she did transfer schools.

160
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:05,664
And went into therapy.

161
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,539
So now?

162
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,735
If I can make Ethel Muggs'
life a little better,

163
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:11,670
even for one afternoon,

164
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:13,579
I'm going to do it.

165
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:18,744
Archibald.

166
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:21,994
I was going to get Principal
Weatherbee to summon you.

167
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:23,516
Hey, Mrs. Blossom.

168
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:25,117
Have a moment to chat?

169
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,485
About Cheryl.

170
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,388
I believe she invited you
to our tree-tapping ceremony?

171
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,556
Yeah.

172
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,391
She did, and like I told her,

173
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:34,994
I don't feel comfortable going.

174
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,829
Cheryl tells me

175
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,498
you have a keen interest in music.

176
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,766
Is that true?

177
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,237
Did she tell you her
Great-Uncle Harrison

178
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:48,073
sits on the board of the
Brandenburg Music Academy?

179
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:51,477
They have an excellent
summer program, I hear.

180
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,513
It's amazing, crazy hard to get into.

181
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,049
Surely not for a talent like you.

182
00:07:57,051 --> 00:08:00,386
And especially not if I put
in a word on your behalf.

183
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:01,420
Mrs. Blossom...

184
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:03,155
At Jason's memorial,

185
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:05,324
you brought me his football jersey.

186
00:08:05,326 --> 00:08:07,293
So sorry for your loss, Mrs. Blossom.

187
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,863
I thought you might want to have this.

188
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,868
That was an act of kindness

189
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,820
on a day of despair.

190
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:20,105
You're good and decent, Archibald,

191
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:22,174
unlike most people in this town.

192
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:24,310
Mrs. Blossom, I don't know what to say.

193
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:27,880
Say you'll reconsider escorting
my daughter to the tapping.

194
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,815
It's just an afternoon.

195
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:32,151
And it would mean the
world to my Cheryl.

196
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:37,189
I mean, yeah. I guess
I could talk to Valerie.

197
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:38,318
I swear, Archibald,

198
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:40,054
when the light hits you just right...

199
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,363
I'll tell Cheryl the good news.

200
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:46,599
And I'll call Great-Uncle Harrison.

201
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:51,904
Just in time, we're celebrating.

202
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,505
Archie was just telling us

203
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:56,108
how he's going to some super-exclusive
music program this summer.

204
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,577
Maybe. If it happens, though,
it would be huge for me.

205
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,812
Do you have to audition for it?

206
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:01,947
Well, not exactly. Mrs.
Blossom came by earlier

207
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,515
and said she'd put a
good word in for me.

208
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:04,917
- Amazing.
- Terrifying.

209
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:07,186
Uh-huh.

210
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:08,854
What's she getting out of it?

211
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:10,456
I told her I'd take Cheryl

212
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,124
to their family's tree-tapping thing.

213
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:13,792
I already talked to Valerie,
and she's cool with it.

214
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:15,094
Cool with you being a gigolo now?

215
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,596
I'm doing someone a favor
for my music, Jughead.

216
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,032
I need to make connections
outside of Riverdale.

217
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:21,367
That's the way of the world.

218
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:22,468
It's all about connections.

219
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,203
But Jughead's right.

220
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:27,139
These kinds of favors
always come with a price tag.

221
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:28,841
Betty, back me up here.

222
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:30,609
I think it's a great idea.

223
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,844
Thank you, Betty.

224
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:34,013
Yeah, and while you're there,

225
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:36,015
would you talk to Polly for me?

226
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:38,754
I just want to make sure she's okay.

227
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:40,519
Definitely.

228
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:41,721
Thank you.

229
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:45,791
And don't worry, Ronnie,
I can take care of myself.

230
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,793
Famous last words, Archiekins.

232
00:09:57,327 --> 00:09:58,459
When Jason died,

233
00:09:58,461 --> 00:09:59,961
I thought I'd tapped my last tree.

234
00:09:59,964 --> 00:10:01,696
Now, don't be nervous.

235
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:03,361
All you have to do is
hold the bucket steady,

236
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:05,191
I'll handle the rest.

237
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:07,068
Who are all these people?

238
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,169
Entre nous,

239
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,210
they're Daddy's board of trustees.

240
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:11,806
They smell blood in the water.

241
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:13,777
That's why they're here.

242
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,477
They're worried Daddy's
losing his grip on the company

243
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:18,746
and they're looking for a
way to take it away from us.

244
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,281
They can do that?

245
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:22,183
If they all vote together, they can.

246
00:10:22,185 --> 00:10:25,035
When Jason died, it was a PR debacle.

247
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:27,863
And now, here's Polly,
pregnant and unwed.

248
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,590
It's no wonder they've descended upon us

249
00:10:29,592 --> 00:10:31,159
like some biblical plague.

250
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:41,602
"Nearly 100 years ago, Grandfather
Blossom came to this sacred maple grove.

251
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:43,804
The annual tapping ceremony

252
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:46,474
portends each season's bounty."

253
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:51,085
Now, I've performed this
ceremony many times in my life.

254
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:54,482
My son Jason, when he came
of age, performed it as well.

255
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,284
In his place,

256
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:58,600
I put forth my daughter Cheryl.

257
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:16,304
Hey.

258
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:19,177
You can do this in your sleep.

259
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:29,884
- Bravo!
- Well done!

260
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:36,720
Good shot. Nice.

261
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,127
Mrs. Lodge, this Quiche
Lorraine is to die for.

262
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,396
Ethel,

263
00:11:42,398 --> 00:11:43,831
you haven't eaten at all.

264
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,032
Oh. Sorry. I just...

265
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:46,334
I'm not really hungry.

266
00:11:46,336 --> 00:11:48,269
Anything we can help with?

267
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:51,072
Uh, my parents...

268
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:54,308
All they do is yell at each other.

269
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,211
My parents are fighting right now, too.

270
00:11:58,682 --> 00:11:59,881
It's terrible.

271
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:03,618
I think my dad had some
bad luck with our savings.

272
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:07,555
Now my mom says we're going
to have to sell the house.

273
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:09,523
My dad is just so...

274
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:11,659
Crushed.

275
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:13,894
I wish there was something
I could do to help him.

276
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:16,931
Girl, we have a lot more
in common than I thought.

277
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:20,429
We lost our place at the Dakota.

278
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:23,647
Look, being ruined sucks.

279
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,841
But you have your
family and you have us.

280
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:28,909
You've got this, Ethel Muggs.

281
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:31,912
"Muggs"?

282
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:34,015
Uh, it's Dutch.

283
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:35,116
We lost the third "G"

284
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:37,351
when my Grandpa Manfred came over.

285
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,901
Archibald! Come join us
before the snow starts again.

286
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,861
Three, two, one.

287
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,167
Polly.

288
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,669
Betty's worried about you.

289
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:56,570
Why won't you call or e-mail her?

290
00:12:57,173 --> 00:12:58,239
She fought for you, Polly,

291
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:00,308
and now you're treating
her like she's the enemy.

292
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,677
Polly, come along.

293
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:07,248
Tell Betty that she
shouldn't worry, okay?

294
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:11,576
Veronica, there's something
that you need to know

295
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,354
- about that Muggs girl.
- What?

296
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:15,189
Her father, Manfred Muggs,

297
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:16,557
invested with your dad.

298
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,226
And it's probable that they lost a lot

299
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:22,129
when your father was
arrested. Maybe everything.

300
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:24,165
Mom, they're being
kicked out of their house,

301
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:25,199
their home.

302
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,367
Well, from what I've been told,

303
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:27,868
the Muggs family is going to testify

304
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,036
against your father.

305
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:30,338
They should.

306
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:32,041
How many, Mom?

307
00:13:32,842 --> 00:13:34,642
How many families like Ethel's?

308
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,279
It's the risk of doing
business with your father.

309
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:40,881
Could Mr. Andrews lose everything,

310
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:42,624
for doing business with you and Dad?

311
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:44,093
I'm not sure.

312
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:46,354
My God.

313
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:58,392
I don't buy this dog-and-pony
show for a second.

314
00:13:58,395 --> 00:13:59,900
Cliff can't control his own family,

315
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:01,001
let alone the company.

316
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:01,954
Agreed.

317
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:04,705
And if he tries to put Cheryl
forward as a successor...

318
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:06,507
Do you remember what
she did at the funeral?

319
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,242
- Crocodile tears.
- Hey.

320
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:09,876
Archie, you don't have to.

321
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:11,544
No, Cheryl loved Jason.

322
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:14,248
What was she meant to do
at his funeral, not cry?

323
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,883
And yeah, Jason was
on the football team,

324
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:17,885
but Cheryl was at
every single game, too,

325
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:19,887
doing as much to help the
Bulldogs win as he did.

326
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:20,955
Also, 4.0.

327
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:23,470
Also, she has a 4.0 grade point average.

328
00:14:23,473 --> 00:14:25,893
If there's one thing that I've
learned being in Cheryl's class,

329
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:27,962
it's don't underestimate her

330
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:29,753
and don't bet against her.

331
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:38,347
Fred, we need to talk.

332
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:41,876
Oh, God.

333
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,013
Hiram and I,

334
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:49,383
we are the anonymous buyers.

335
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:53,854
You're working for Lodge Industries.

336
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:56,724
How do you not tell me that?

337
00:14:56,726 --> 00:14:58,492
You never would have gotten involved.

338
00:14:58,494 --> 00:14:59,627
You're damn straight.

339
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:00,861
Because I didn't sign up

340
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,230
to go into business with a
criminal like Hiram Lodge.

341
00:15:03,232 --> 00:15:06,789
I'm trying to turn Lodge
Industries legitimate.

342
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:09,503
That means partnering
with people like you,

343
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,005
good people.

344
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,922
This is why Cliff Blossom
bought out my crew?

345
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:19,346
Sent thugs to beat up teenagers?

346
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:22,159
Clifford didn't send those thugs.

347
00:15:23,286 --> 00:15:24,585
Hiram did.

348
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:26,687
He was trying to stop us.

349
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:30,157
He found out about you
and me from Clifford.

350
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,126
So you have dragged me into a war

351
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:35,029
between Hiram and
Clifford, that's great.

352
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:36,630
I know you're angry.

353
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:38,966
And I know that I have
no right to ask this...

354
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:42,536
But please stay on this project.

355
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:45,005
If you jump ship, I can't
start over with someone else.

356
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:46,674
So, I do the grunt work

357
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:48,375
while your husband's
taking potshots at me

358
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:50,044
and you're playing both sides?

359
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,479
The whole time?

360
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:54,014
I gotta take a walk.

361
00:15:57,887 --> 00:16:00,087
Archibald, do you know,
when Cheryl told me

362
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,789
that she wanted you to come with us,

363
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,524
I was a little taken aback.

364
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:08,096
Your father and I haven't
been seeing eye-to-eye lately.

365
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:09,730
I came for Cheryl, Mr. Blossom.

366
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:12,001
And because I'm grateful for
what Mrs. Blossom is doing for me.

367
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:13,701
The music academy, you mean?

368
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:16,437
Yeah, that would be quite a feather
in your cap, now, wouldn't it?

369
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,973
You know, we can be extremely generous,

370
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:21,342
Archibald, to the right people.

371
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:24,845
Now later this week, we're
hosting a banquet for the board

372
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:26,180
at the Belmont Lodge.

373
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:27,982
It's a simple thing, a little dinner,

374
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:29,750
chit-chat, dancing.

375
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:32,853
We would love you to
attend as Cheryl's escort.

376
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:34,622
You two make quite the pair.

377
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:38,623
Oh, I'm honored, Mr.
Blossom, really, but...

378
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:39,825
But nothing.

379
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:42,830
You have to come, I'm wearing viridian.

380
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,849
He'll need a proper suit,
don't you think, Daddy?

381
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:46,251
I'll have my tailor fit you.

382
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:49,107
If that's not a problem?

383
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:54,451
No. No, no, it's just...

384
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:56,586
I'm an Andrews, Mr.
Blossom, like you said.

385
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:58,588
My dad works construction,

386
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,991
a fancy banquet's not really our thing.

387
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:02,759
That's precisely why you should come.

388
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,909
People like you are
the bedrock of our town.

389
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:08,298
You're hard workers.

390
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,746
Plus, I need a dance partner.

391
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:13,949
We won't take no for an answer...

392
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:16,540
Archiekins.

393
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,741
Who would have predicted this?

394
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,096
Archie Andrews is our
fox in the henhouse.

395
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,880
Tell us about Polly.

396
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,815
How is she? Did she seem okay?

397
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,383
The Blossoms are treating her great.

398
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,318
But, Betty, I don't
think she's coming back.

399
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,753
I don't think she wants to.

400
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,756
That doesn't make any
sense. That's not Polly.

401
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,658
She made her choice.

402
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,793
We have to learn to live with that.

403
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:47,364
No. I know my sister. She
wouldn't do that to us.

404
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,099
Something else is going on.

405
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,367
What else did you see, Archie?

406
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,602
When you were in the
sticky, red thick of it?

407
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,271
Anything about the board?

408
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,887
Cheryl said that they're worried...

409
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:59,776
That after all the scandal
with Jason and Polly,

410
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:03,100
that they might try and steal
the company from Mr. Blossom.

411
00:18:03,103 --> 00:18:05,248
Well, do you hear that, Betty?

412
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,826
This is our story. A hostile takeover.

413
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:11,254
No wonder the trustees are in town.

414
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,390
The Blossom empire is crumbling.

415
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,491
Okay, but, Mom,

416
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,660
if you write a story attacking them

417
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,528
while Polly's still in Thornhill...

418
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,096
Enough about Polly.

419
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,531
I mean it.

420
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,866
She's the one that betrayed us,

421
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,201
not the other way around.

422
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,238
Obviously she's jealous...

423
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,105
Cheryl,

424
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,408
can we have a word?

425
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:33,848
Scatter, my Vixens.

426
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,647
Yes, Betty? What is it?

427
00:18:38,523 --> 00:18:39,889
Polly.

428
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:45,488
Look, I don't know what kind of Stockholm
syndrome spell you've cast on her,

429
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:47,490
but I want to talk to my sister.

430
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,359
Let's not fight.

431
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,461
Especially not when we
should be celebrating.

432
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,029
Why? What happened?

433
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,130
Haven't you heard?

434
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,433
Dr. Patel just confirmed
it this morning.

435
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,101
Polly is having twins.

436
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,665
Bless our Blossom genes!

437
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:02,872
And she didn't call to tell me.

438
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:04,541
Hostages aren't normally allowed

439
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,009
to make outgoing calls.

440
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,178
Can you please just give
her a message for me?

441
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,580
As long as it doesn't upset her.

442
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,782
Tell her she should call our mom.

443
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:15,051
She's trying really hard to hide it,

444
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,221
but I can tell she's really,
really hurt and upset.

445
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,523
- I'll pass your message along...
- Thank you.

446
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:21,591
If I remember.

447
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,692
Cheryl.

448
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,628
That was a joke, you hobo.

449
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,030
Of course I'll give
her your message, Betty.

450
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,799
But no promises that
she'll care or respond.

451
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,910
Okay, Ethel,

452
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:36,246
open your eyes.

453
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,944
What is happening?

454
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,545
I was purging my closet,

455
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:44,781
thinking how you would look magnificent

456
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,316
in some of these.

457
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,506
Here, try this on.

458
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,690
This is... This is so nice.

459
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:58,336
And I love this. It is so you, Ethel.

460
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:02,099
Ronnie, I can't take all this.

461
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:04,067
I want you to have it.

462
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:06,895
These things...

463
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,506
My dad gave them to me.

464
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,641
He always brought home gifts

465
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,678
whenever he did something wrong.

466
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,359
As a way to make up for it, I guess.

467
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:20,216
Did it work?

468
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:23,845
What girl is immune to the
charms of a Givenchy bag?

469
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,757
And I still wear these
pearls he gave me.

470
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,328
Okay, but...

471
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,296
You don't have to do anything.

472
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,765
Give me anything.

473
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,110
I just want to be friends.

474
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,905
Me, too, Ethel.

475
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,646
Mr. Andrews! Nice haircut.

476
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,148
You're looking extremely DILF-y today.

477
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,683
Is Archie home?

478
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,618
Cheryl, yes.

479
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,620
Um, come on in.

480
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,759
The Ice Woman cometh.

481
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,261
Hey, Cheryl.

482
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:07,066
As a maj thank-you for coming

483
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:09,665
to the maple banquet with me tomorrow,

484
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,301
I wanted to give you this.

485
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,404
An '84 Les Paul.

486
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,605
In our signature color.

487
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,806
You're welcome.

488
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:21,581
Okay. That's all. I'm going now.

489
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:24,414
My claustrophobia acts
up in small houses.

490
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,758
See you tomorrow.

491
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,126
I'd give that back if I were you.

492
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,527
Dad, come on. The Blossoms,

493
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,896
they're helping me get into
that summer music program.

494
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,064
Like, the best in the country.

495
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,332
And since when did the Blossoms

496
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,367
ever give a damn about you, Archie?

497
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,069
Well, they think I have potential, Dad.

498
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,538
He's also pimping himself out to Cheryl.

499
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:52,142
The Blossoms tried to run
our business into the ground.

500
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,310
Maybe if you tried
talking to Mr. Blossom...

501
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:55,844
I tried talking to him, Archie,

502
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,050
he laughed in my face.

503
00:21:57,053 --> 00:22:00,850
Don't think for a second that the
Blossoms are looking out for you.

504
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,185
They're using you, Archie.

505
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:06,001
They look at us like we're
dirt under their shoe.

506
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,725
I'm over it.

507
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:19,536
What's this?

508
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,271
The biggest story we've ever broken.

509
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:24,073
A tell-all expose on the Blossom clan

510
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:26,009
and all of their glorious corruption.

511
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,343
Um, would you mind telling me

512
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,078
what your mother is talking about?

513
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,114
It's time that they finally answer

514
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,882
to everything that they've done to us,

515
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,584
including taking Polly.

516
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,220
By the way, Polly's living
with the Blossoms now,

517
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,956
so congratulations, you've
finally got what you wanted.

518
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,491
She's officially out of our lives.

519
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,694
I'm not publishing
your personal vendetta.

520
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,020
Well, it's a good thing I
don't need your permission.

521
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,273
What did you do, Hal?

522
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,209
Well, you kicked me out.

523
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,578
So, now, I'm kicking you out.

524
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,273
If we expose the Blossoms, maybe...

525
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:08,418
Just maybe, we might
have a chance in hell

526
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,686
to get our daughter back.

527
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,088
You are done here, Alice. You're fired.

528
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,961
Fine, Hal.

529
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,107
What?

530
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:39,415
I want my daughter back, you bastard!

531
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,286
Mom!

532
00:23:52,886 --> 00:23:55,620
Black piping for the velvet, of course.

533
00:23:55,622 --> 00:23:57,355
I'll take measurements for the pants.

534
00:23:57,357 --> 00:23:58,923
Uh, before we do that...

535
00:24:00,794 --> 00:24:03,161
Could I talk to you, Mr. Blossom?

536
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,971
Things aren't going
great at my dad's company.

537
00:24:13,907 --> 00:24:15,940
And I know you two have
been at odds recently.

538
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:19,677
But I was wondering, instead of
helping me with that music school, if...

539
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,972
Maybe you could help my dad.

540
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:25,410
Are you negotiating on
behalf of your father?

541
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:28,653
No, no, I'm impressed.

542
00:24:30,156 --> 00:24:33,258
In fact, I'm trying to imagine
if Jason would ever have

543
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,792
given up something like that for me,

544
00:24:34,794 --> 00:24:36,227
and I don't believe so.

545
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:39,086
It speaks to your character, son.

546
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:41,132
But I'll tell you what,

547
00:24:41,134 --> 00:24:43,167
we've already called the
Brandenburg Music Academy.

548
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:45,089
And they're very excited
to meet you, by the way.

549
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,051
Let's just get through
this banquet, all right?

550
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,320
Sit down man-to-man

551
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:53,057
and discuss what I can
do for Fred Andrews.

552
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:55,913
Is it satisfactory?

553
00:24:58,718 --> 00:25:00,318
It's more than satisfactory.

554
00:25:01,153 --> 00:25:03,520
My parents are unbelievable, Jug.

555
00:25:03,522 --> 00:25:05,088
Polly is locked up in that house

556
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,790
like a character out of Jane Eyre,

557
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:08,358
and what are they doing?

558
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,226
Changing each other's login accounts

559
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:11,995
and throwing bricks through windows.

560
00:25:11,998 --> 00:25:13,496
I wish I'd seen that.

561
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:17,400
Okay, I'm sorry, that's not funny.

562
00:25:17,402 --> 00:25:18,902
It's like, you know
how, in a time of crisis,

563
00:25:18,904 --> 00:25:21,538
people either come
together or fall apart?

564
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:27,293
It feels like we're falling apart.

565
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,012
And the way things
are going, pretty soon,

566
00:25:29,014 --> 00:25:31,681
the Coopers, we're not
gonna exist anymore.

567
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:33,516
And there's nothing
I can do to stop that.

568
00:25:33,518 --> 00:25:34,784
Betty, don't do that.

569
00:25:34,786 --> 00:25:35,952
Don't give up.

570
00:25:37,322 --> 00:25:39,355
Your family is definitely
splintering right now,

571
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:41,658
but it won't fall apart, because of you.

572
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,366
Because you're holding them together.

573
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:47,630
You're so much stronger

574
00:25:47,632 --> 00:25:49,332
than all of the white noise.

575
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:52,202
You're stronger than your mother,

576
00:25:52,204 --> 00:25:53,970
you're stronger than your father.

577
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:57,307
You're holding this family together.

578
00:25:59,711 --> 00:26:01,277
So don't.

579
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:04,013
Don't let go.

580
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,716
I won't.

581
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:17,093
Valerie, hi.

582
00:26:17,095 --> 00:26:18,261
I thought you should know,

583
00:26:18,263 --> 00:26:20,330
Cheryl poured some
insane poison into my ear

584
00:26:20,332 --> 00:26:21,798
about how close you two are getting.

585
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:24,834
She legit thinks she's going to
steal you away from me or something.

586
00:26:24,836 --> 00:26:26,836
- No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.

587
00:26:27,506 --> 00:26:28,905
And I don't blame her.

588
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:31,676
The new guitar, the new suit?

589
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:34,644
The Blossoms are buying you.

590
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:36,579
For one night, if it helps my dad

591
00:26:36,581 --> 00:26:37,981
and gets me into that music program...

592
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:40,517
Wouldn't you rather earn
your place at that table?

593
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,672
With your music?

594
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:43,820
All the Blossoms are doing
is opening a door for me.

595
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:45,622
What would you do if
you were in my place?

596
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:47,457
If you have to ask,

597
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:49,459
then you don't know me at all, Archie.

598
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:52,328
Oh, my God, did you hear?

599
00:26:53,498 --> 00:26:55,298
Remember when you went
swooping in to save Ethel,

600
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,216
'cause you thought
she might be suicidal?

601
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:00,236
Oh, no. She didn't...

602
00:27:00,238 --> 00:27:01,704
No, but her dad did.

603
00:27:01,706 --> 00:27:04,841
He accidentally swallowed a
whole bottle of sleeping pills.

604
00:27:04,844 --> 00:27:07,143
He's going to be okay,

605
00:27:07,145 --> 00:27:09,646
but that's why Ethel's
been so sad lately.

606
00:27:09,648 --> 00:27:10,813
Now, everybody knows...

607
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:48,392
We were tested this year.

608
00:27:48,395 --> 00:27:51,229
As a town, as a company,

609
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:52,997
mainly as a family.

610
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,517
And it may not have been Jason's hand

611
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,878
that staked the maple this year,

612
00:27:56,881 --> 00:28:00,027
but it was the hand of hope.

613
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:12,115
Don't think they're
being nice or genuine.

614
00:28:12,118 --> 00:28:15,054
They wanted me to fail
at the tree-tapping.

615
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:17,422
But you're going to help with all that.

616
00:28:17,424 --> 00:28:18,823
I'll do whatever I can.

617
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:22,581
Archibald, have a word?

618
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:24,849
I'll be right back.

619
00:28:27,154 --> 00:28:28,320
I just wanted to let you know

620
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:30,288
that I've decided to help your father.

621
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:33,325
You did? You will?

622
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:35,226
Well, you've helped our family.

623
00:28:35,228 --> 00:28:36,895
Cheryl, especially.

624
00:28:37,764 --> 00:28:39,436
You fit in so well.

625
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:41,333
I think you and your father

626
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:43,201
have a very bright future with us.

627
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:44,202
Thank you, Mr. Blossom.

628
00:28:44,204 --> 00:28:45,937
Oh. "Clifford", please.

629
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:48,073
And just so you know,

630
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:49,874
you don't have to keep doing me favors.

631
00:28:49,876 --> 00:28:51,042
I like Cheryl.

632
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:53,241
And I'm happy to be here
for her, as a friend.

633
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,540
You know, I'm going
to be honest with you.

634
00:28:56,683 --> 00:28:58,717
Cheryl's a bright girl,

635
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,419
but the Blossom board,
they're very skeptical

636
00:29:01,421 --> 00:29:04,422
of having her play an
active role in the company.

637
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:08,093
Now, someone with your stock
and character by her side,

638
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:11,988
tempering her more erratic behavior...

639
00:29:13,356 --> 00:29:14,789
You know, it's about...

640
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:17,769
Creating a picture.

641
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:19,104
The right picture.

642
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:21,206
Having you with us, with Cheryl,

643
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,208
it tells a very appealing story.

644
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,977
Which is something I think we
could all use right about now.

645
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:29,202
You'll help us, won't you?

646
00:29:29,205 --> 00:29:31,116
Excuse me, Mr. Blossom,

647
00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:32,851
may I have this first dance with Archie?

648
00:29:32,853 --> 00:29:34,586
I think that's an excellent idea.

649
00:29:39,893 --> 00:29:42,363
Polly, can we talk about
what's going on here?

650
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:44,863
Just keep dancing.

651
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,564
And smiling.

652
00:29:49,202 --> 00:29:51,002
Betty keeps asking Cheryl about me,

653
00:29:51,004 --> 00:29:52,103
she needs to stop.

654
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:54,639
As long as she's worried about
you, Polly, she'll never stop.

655
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:56,274
Yes, she will...

656
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:59,211
If I tell you the real
reason I'm at Thornhill.

657
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,247
The Blossoms had something
to do with Jason's death,

658
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:03,381
I'm sure of it.

659
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:05,102
They threatened him
and I'm gonna prove it.

660
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:06,704
Is that why you keep blowing Betty off?

661
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:08,086
It has to be believable.

662
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:10,455
And I don't want her
trying to rescue me.

663
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,590
Can you please tell her that for me?

664
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:14,359
- I'm so done with this!
- Do not make a scene.

665
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:16,094
- No, I'm done. I'm done!
- Not now.

666
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:17,429
Polly, will you excuse me?

667
00:30:31,078 --> 00:30:32,343
Betty.

668
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:34,345
Veronica, hey.

669
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:35,413
Mom, these are my friends.

670
00:30:35,415 --> 00:30:37,727
This is Betty and this is Veronica.

671
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:39,551
Mrs. Muggs.

672
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:41,319
Ethel...

673
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:44,122
We heard what happened,

674
00:30:44,124 --> 00:30:46,858
and we wanted to leave
these flowers with you.

675
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:48,993
That's very kind. Thank you.

676
00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:50,228
Please don't...

677
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,530
Don't thank me.

678
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:55,982
We're just so glad Mr.
Muggs is going to be okay.

679
00:30:56,703 --> 00:30:58,369
And we'll see you at school, Ethel?

680
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,610
You don't need to do this, Vee.

681
00:31:07,314 --> 00:31:08,713
Ethel?

682
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:11,750
Mrs. Muggs?

683
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:15,476
There's something I need to tell you.

684
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:24,095
My name is Veronica Lodge.

685
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:27,899
- My father is...
- Hiram Lodge.

686
00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:30,068
Hmm.

687
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:33,772
And you're showing your face here?

688
00:31:33,774 --> 00:31:35,974
Mom, she's my friend.

689
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:37,842
She's not your friend, honey.

690
00:31:39,646 --> 00:31:41,112
Her father is a criminal.

691
00:31:41,114 --> 00:31:43,615
He's the reason Dad did this to himself.

692
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:46,985
Ronnie?

693
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,404
Is that true?

694
00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:51,322
Yes.

695
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:54,325
And I am so sorry.

696
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:55,960
I wish I could do something.

697
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:58,229
"Sorry" isn't good enough.

698
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:01,166
You want to do
something? Tell the truth.

699
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:03,301
Your father is ruining lives.

700
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:06,816
He deserves to sit behind bars
for the rest of his miserable life.

701
00:32:12,946 --> 00:32:14,379
Come on.

702
00:32:16,883 --> 00:32:18,082
Come on.

703
00:32:29,095 --> 00:32:30,395
Cheryl.

704
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:32,697
You okay?

705
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,699
What did my dad say to you?

706
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:37,303
That everyone thinks I'm a train wreck?

707
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:44,509
Jason was the golden boy,

708
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:46,277
but me...

709
00:32:48,114 --> 00:32:50,215
People hate me, Archie.

710
00:32:51,377 --> 00:32:54,178
And at school, that's fine, whatever.

711
00:32:54,454 --> 00:32:55,787
But this is my family.

712
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,022
Forget them, Cheryl.

713
00:32:59,092 --> 00:33:00,491
Forget what they think.

714
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:02,961
I think you're awesome.

715
00:33:05,498 --> 00:33:07,098
Oh, Archie,

716
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,454
sometimes I think you may be the
only decent person left in Riverdale.

717
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:12,871
The only person who doesn't
want something from me.

718
00:33:12,873 --> 00:33:15,407
Or who doesn't want me to
apologize for who I am...

719
00:33:16,643 --> 00:33:18,042
And what I want.

720
00:33:25,652 --> 00:33:26,951
What are you doing?

721
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,373
My lipstick's maple red, by the way.

722
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,325
In case you're wondering
why it tastes so sweet.

723
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:47,876
They seem satisfied, but Uncle

724
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:49,974
Bedford keeps asking
about the drive-in land.

725
00:33:49,976 --> 00:33:52,343
I am so close to getting that land back.

726
00:33:53,787 --> 00:33:56,087
Hermione Lodge will crumble.

727
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,383
Who would have thought
she'd prove so resourceful?

728
00:33:58,385 --> 00:34:00,551
Maybe you should've sent
her to jail instead of Hiram.

729
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:09,861
Hey.

730
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:13,908
How was your night?

731
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:26,076
I just got back from the hospital

732
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,712
where Ethel's dad is.

733
00:34:30,406 --> 00:34:32,331
Because he tried to kill himself...

734
00:34:33,853 --> 00:34:36,087
Because of what Daddy did...

735
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:40,176
And, for all I know, continues to do.

736
00:34:44,397 --> 00:34:47,498
I am done lying for Dad.

737
00:35:04,384 --> 00:35:05,583
Archie!

738
00:35:07,654 --> 00:35:10,054
I thought it was Cinderella
that ran away from the ball,

739
00:35:10,056 --> 00:35:11,756
not Prince Charming.

740
00:35:11,758 --> 00:35:13,861
Cheryl, I can't do this
right now. I'm leaving.

741
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:15,097
Archie Andrews,

742
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,530
if you leave, the radiant sun that is
the Blossom family stops shining on you.

743
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:21,699
And everything we've given you,

744
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,391
including Brandenburg, disappears.

745
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:26,571
Are you sure you want to give that up?

746
00:35:26,573 --> 00:35:28,673
Are you sure you want
to do that to your dad?

747
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:31,776
Cheryl, I came here as a
favor to your mom, to help you.

748
00:35:32,912 --> 00:35:35,546
Oh, Archie, don't start lying now.

749
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:37,482
You may not want anything from me,

750
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:39,851
but you do from my mom and dad,

751
00:35:39,853 --> 00:35:41,519
that's why you're here.

752
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:44,088
Which means,

753
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,923
as much as I want you to be
better than everyone else...

754
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:48,226
You're not.

755
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:49,727
You're just like the others.

756
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:51,396
I'm sorry, Cheryl...

757
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:53,164
But I can't do this anymore.

758
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,099
Goodbye.

759
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,807
Mom?

760
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:06,410
Archie just called. He talked to Polly.

761
00:36:06,412 --> 00:36:08,078
She's safe.

762
00:36:09,014 --> 00:36:10,147
She's okay, Mom.

763
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:11,949
She didn't choose the Blossoms over us,

764
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:13,917
she's actually there to spy on them.

765
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:31,468
You know, when I went
after this story...

766
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:38,408
I thought, in the back of my mind that,

767
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,010
"What if this is it?

768
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:42,045
What if this is finally the time

769
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:43,514
that she doesn't come back?"

770
00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:45,349
She will, Mom.

771
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:48,485
And right now, she's
our woman on the inside.

772
00:36:48,487 --> 00:36:50,320
We're going to write this story.

773
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:53,090
Come write with us

774
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:54,525
at Blue and Gold.

775
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:56,493
The school newspaper?

776
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:59,069
Yeah, that's what we are.

777
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:01,632
But I'm pretty sure that
our annual operating budget

778
00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:03,066
is bigger than the Register's.

779
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:20,184
Val.

780
00:37:20,186 --> 00:37:21,885
Val, hey.

781
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:25,789
Look, you were right.

782
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:27,624
About being bought and taking shortcuts.

783
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:29,760
After last night, I'm done
with the Blossoms, I am.

784
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:32,696
Good for you, Archie,
but I'm done with you.

785
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:35,766
Ever since we started
dating you've ignored me,

786
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:37,401
you've ditched me.

787
00:37:37,403 --> 00:37:38,735
Val, please.

788
00:37:38,738 --> 00:37:40,704
Let me make it up to you.

789
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:43,340
Sorry, Archie, but unlike
you, I won't be bought.

790
00:37:49,915 --> 00:37:51,215
Just listen, Fred.

791
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:53,350
So many families have
been hurt by the Lodges.

792
00:37:53,352 --> 00:37:55,519
Now, I don't want
yours to be another one.

793
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:57,554
I've decided to sell to Clifford...

794
00:37:57,557 --> 00:37:59,189
Before it gets any worse.

795
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:00,357
No, you're not.

796
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:01,792
I'm going to stay with the project.

797
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:04,104
That's great.

798
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,230
Thank you.

799
00:38:06,232 --> 00:38:08,165
Don't thank me. I'm
not doing it for you.

800
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:10,868
See, from now on,
everything we do around here

801
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,636
is going to be legal.

802
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:14,838
A hundred percent above board.

803
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,970
Agreed. Of course.

804
00:38:16,973 --> 00:38:19,005
Also, my stake is 20%.

805
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:21,278
If I'm gonna put myself on the line,

806
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,746
I need some skin in the game.

807
00:38:24,454 --> 00:38:26,421
That's a really big share.

808
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:32,251
I'm sick of you people using
me and my family as pawns.

809
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:34,958
Sure.

810
00:38:36,028 --> 00:38:37,261
Anything else?

811
00:38:37,264 --> 00:38:38,862
Yes.

812
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:40,230
You and me...

813
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:42,165
Whatever was going on there is over.

814
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:43,934
Now, we're just business partners.

815
00:38:45,938 --> 00:38:47,337
That's it.

816
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:55,178
Right.

817
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:12,863
Ethel, I meant what I said.

818
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,134
I'm sorry, Ethel,

819
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,570
for everything my family did to yours.

820
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:28,078
It's not your fault what your dad did.

821
00:39:29,114 --> 00:39:31,181
And you were there for
me when no one else was.

822
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:34,151
More than once.

823
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:37,054
Seat's not taken, if you want it.

824
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:42,526
It seemed that, for Veronica,

825
00:39:42,528 --> 00:39:45,829
the sins of the father
would remain simply that.

826
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:50,467
While Archie Andrews
returned from the brink

827
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:52,102
with one more bit of news.

828
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:55,272
At the banquet, I heard Mr.
And Mrs. Blossom talking.

829
00:39:55,274 --> 00:39:57,274
It sounded like Clifford
Blossom was responsible

830
00:39:57,276 --> 00:39:59,776
for sending Veronica's dad to jail.

831
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:01,044
Oh, my God.

832
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,014
If Clifford sent Hiram Lodge to jail,

833
00:40:04,016 --> 00:40:06,071
tore apart his family,

834
00:40:06,074 --> 00:40:08,986
then maybe Hiram was trying
to do the same thing to him?

835
00:40:08,988 --> 00:40:11,455
Yeah, by going after what
the Blossoms value most,

836
00:40:11,457 --> 00:40:14,324
their family, their legacy.

837
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:16,760
That's a motive.

838
00:40:26,171 --> 00:40:28,839
Winter had come early to Riverdale.

839
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:32,075
Brutal and unforgiving.

840
00:40:33,268 --> 00:40:34,634
Did it work?

841
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:36,826
Are the vultures appeased?

842
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:38,582
We're not out of the woods yet.

843
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:39,783
But it would be nothing

844
00:40:39,785 --> 00:40:41,418
compared to the storm
that was gathering.

845
00:40:43,722 --> 00:40:46,009
A storm of chaos named...

846
00:40:46,012 --> 00:40:47,946
...Cheryl Blossom.

847
00:40:52,064 --> 00:40:53,263
Yes?

848
00:40:53,266 --> 00:40:54,526
Good night, Cheryl.

849
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:56,806
Good night, Pollykins.

850
