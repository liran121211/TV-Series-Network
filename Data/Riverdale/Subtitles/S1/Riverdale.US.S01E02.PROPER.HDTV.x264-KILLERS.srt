174
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:44,038
Weirdest thing. This summer, we
were supposed to go on a road trip

175
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:47,184
over July 4th weekend...

176
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:51,154
Which you bailed on at the last minute.

177
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,226
Is there something
you wanna tell me, pal?

(BELL RINGING)

180
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:15,272
We were wondering, Cheryl.

181
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:17,674
Back in July, you told the
po-po that Jason drowned.

182
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:21,411
Yet, we come to find out
that Jason didn't drown.

183
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:25,115
He was shot. That's
slightly suspicious, no?

184
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,919
Are you living mannequins suggesting I had
something to do with my brother's death?

185
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,621
We're just curious. What do
the police think happened?

186
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:35,325
I'll tell you what I told them, which
is that Jason did fall into the water.

187
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:39,429
We both did. I made it
to the shore. He didn't.

188
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,331
Maybe he made it to
the other side of the

189
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:43,367
river and someone shot him
there. Who knows?

190
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:46,403
Seats, everyone. Pair off,
gloves on, scalpels up.

191
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:47,313
Can I be with Cheryl?

192
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:48,971
And I wanna be with Betty.

193
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:51,975
Oh, uh, I was thinking
I'd partner with Kevin.

194
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:55,679
Actually, uh, Keller's
with me. We, like, talked.

195
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:57,170
Oh, God.

196
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:03,487
- Once again, fate throws us together.
- Hmm.

197
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:06,890
So... Saturday night.

198
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:09,126
Listen, Moose, you're hot. Yes.

199
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:11,862
My type? Definitely.

200
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:14,531
But you've got more demons
than <i>The Exorcist.</i>

201
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,633
We're all on the spectrum,
but my gay-o-meter

202
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,636
says you should stick with
what you know best... Girls.

203
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:22,305
Cheryl, we haven't
talked since the summer.

204
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,674
I just want to say, I'm really
sorry about your brother.

205
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:26,209
Jason was the best.

206
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:28,278
If I can do anything to help.

207
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,981
That's sweet, Archie, but unless
you were at Sweetwater River

208
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,682
and know who shot Jason...

209
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,128
Do, uh, do you know if
the police have any leads?

210
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:49,900
What? No, you ghoul. But
it's only a matter of time.

211
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:53,003
And my twintuition is telling
me it's someone we all know.

212
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:57,307
Right. Well, I'm not great at science,

213
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:59,876
but I can take point on this
if it's too weird for you.

214
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:01,599
Weird, why?

215
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:06,650
Oh, you mean because my brother
is being dissected with a blade,

216
00:12:06,652 --> 00:12:09,820
just like this one,
possibly at this very moment?

217
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:12,089
Don't worry, I'm fine.

218
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:15,897
In fact, I'm amazing.

219
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:21,131
Every corpse has as tale to
tell. Step closer to the body.

220
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:26,103
There are several morbid details you
should find relevant to your article.

221
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,106
What details, Dr. Curdle?

222
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:31,272
What sticks out to you?

223
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:34,678
The marbling of the veins.
Signs of scavenger activity.

224
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:37,547
Ligature marks on both wrists.

225
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:41,251
And a hint of
cryo-necrotic preservation.

226
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,257
Small bills, right?

227
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:54,464
So, what did Moose want?

228
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:56,766
Oh, my God, I don't even think he knows.

229
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:59,636
I mean, I am devastatingly
handsome in that classic,

230
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:01,805
pre-accident Montgomery
Clift kind of way,

231
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:06,209
and sexuality is fluid, but can someone
named Moose actually be that fluid?

232
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:08,678
- (LAUGHS)
- Okay, well, I ship it.

233
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,848
Well, of course you would. You're
a big city girl with loose morals.

234
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:16,920
I just meant that Moose has
an official girlfriend, Midge.

235
00:13:17,684 --> 00:13:19,979
Anyway, it's terrible
to say, but part of me

236
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:22,349
wishes he would just
stay in the darn closet.

237
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:27,797
Obviously, I didn't mean literal closet.

238
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,166
Archie!

239
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:34,237
Any new material you wanna try
out on a very forgiving audience?

240
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:35,201
I...

241
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:36,658
Please?

242
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,483
Would you?

243
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,569
I'd love to hear it.

244
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:44,915
I'm still working on the lyrics, so...

245
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:47,751

No, I'm not.

- Betty, wait. Come on. Listen to me.
- No.

262
00:14:56,088 --> 00:15:01,124
No, when... When I think, Archie, of
where I feel safest and most myself,

263
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:03,460
- I think of us, in a booth, at Pop's...
- Me, too.

want to get off your chest,

279
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:48,989
perhaps about Jason,
now would be the time.

280
00:15:53,945 --> 00:15:56,313
Weatherbee just asked me if
I knew anything about Jason.

281
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,448
And?

282
00:15:58,473 --> 00:16:00,047
What did you say?

283
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:01,985
Nothing. That I didn't.

284
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:05,588
But he said that if I did, I shouldn't be
scared, and he'd make sure I was okay.

285
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,657
Of course he would, you're his student.

00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:11,461
Is this...

00:16:11,963 --> 00:16:13,897
How you feel about me?

288
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,465
Is it real?

289
00:16:18,904 --> 00:16:21,938
Because if it's not, then I
don't know what I'm protecting.

290
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:27,210
It is.

291
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:31,715
It is real.

292
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:37,920
Maybe it's not right, but it's real.

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,491

drown under the town's scrutiny,

315
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,512
or be swamped by her emotions?

316
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,949
The answer, ladies, is "no" and "no."

317
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:08,519
That said, I need star power.

318
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,355
I need the Pussycats.

319
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,024

totally need a pedicure. You?

I know everyone grieves differently,

323
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,613
but Cheryl's hosting a pep
rally to cope with her loss.

324
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,516
That's either brilliant,
or psychotic, or both.

325
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:42,219
Yeah, well, at least Cheryl's
not putting on an act.

Pretending she's a butterfly
when really she's a wasp.

327
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,597
For the record, the only reason I
went into that closet with Archie

328
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,299
was so that Cheryl wouldn't.

329
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,035
- Oh, so you did it to protect me?
- Damn straight.

330
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,238
Okay, so nothing happened between
you and Archie in the closet, then?

331
00:19:01,928 --> 00:19:03,620

what you want, I'll accept that.

But what, exactly, did Archie do wrong?

347
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,383
- Are you seriously taking his side?
- No, I'm not taking any...

I was having trouble reading,
and my teacher, Mrs. Gribrock,

393

told my mom and dad that I should
stay back a year, to get caught up.

Betty was so against us
not being in the same grade

that she took it upon herself
to tutor me every single day.

I'm wondering if the Blossoms
didn't kill Jason themselves.

I am so proud of how you
stood up to that dragoness,

gonna let them hurt you?

He may not be crushing on you,

but he does love you.

515
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:02,225
And he's legit miserable without
you, if it's any consolation.

516

What exactly were you and
Kevin doing at the river, huh?

524
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:33,724
Or does being with the sheriff's
son give you a free pass? Keller?

scrawny, pathetic Internet troll,

685

687

You're here for me, aren't you?

688
00:41:02,744 --> 00:41:04,410
Because of the autopsy?

689
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:08,648
We don't need to do this in

691
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:13,370

697
00:41:27,335 --> 00:41:30,315

698
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:36,576
<i>That Jason didn't die on
July 4th, as we believed,</i>

699
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:39,279
