1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:02,337
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

2
00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:05,298
<i>The story is about a town,
once wholesome and innocent,</i>

3
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:08,635
<i>now forever changed
by the mysterious murder
of Jason Blossom...</i>

4
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,220
This is our insurance.

5
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:11,930
In case everything
goes to hell.

6
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:13,264
Stash it. Keep it safe.

7
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:14,933
I talked it over
with Mrs. Cooper.

8
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,059
She's a part of this?

9
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:18,436
She's gonna keep FP busy
while we search his trailer

10
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,855
to find anything
that links FP to Jason.

11
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,607
<i>Or, more importantly,
FP to my dad.</i>

12
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:24,109
We went to your
dad's trailer...

13
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:25,902
- Why would you guys do that?
- We were wrong.

14
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:27,529
We didn't find anything.

15
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:29,781
- You went behind
my back, Archie?
- Jug...

16
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,116
My dad just told Mayor McCoy

17
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:32,826
- about your dad.
- What about my dad?

18
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:35,537
<i>He was just arrested.
For the murder of
Jason Blossom.</i>

19
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,418
Someone planted the gun...

20
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:43,628
Jason's murder weapon,
in a closet in FP's trailer.

21
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:46,047
It wasn't there when
we searched for it.
He's being framed, Betty.

22
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:47,590
Well, maybe you didn't see it.

23
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,634
We're not talking about
the <i>Vogue</i> closet here, Bee...

24
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:51,052
Well, maybe you looked
in the wrong one.

25
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:53,638
It's a trailer
with literally one closet.

26
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:55,390
There was no lockbox. No gun.

27
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:58,393
Whatever Sheriff Keller
is saying he found,
it wasn't there.

28
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:01,354
Look, we need to tell Jughead
his dad's innocent.
Where is Jughead?

29
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:02,522
I don't know.

30
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,525
I tried calling him.
I left him messages.
He's not answering his phone.

31
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:07,235
In the meantime...

32
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:09,154
- Should we talk
to Sheriff Keller?
No.

33
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:10,655
Not until we tell our parents.

34
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,741
That we broke into
FP's trailer?

35
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:14,200
My dad will know what to do.

36
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,119
You did what?

37
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,788
We had to make sure
FP wasn't involved
in Jason's murder.

38
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:20,623
And now we know the truth.
He was.

39
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:22,792
What? Mom, no.
We just told you.

40
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,003
- The gun was planted.
- By whoever killed Jason.

41
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,379
Couldn't you have
just missed it?

42
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:29,758
Yeah, excuse me if I trust
the detection skills
of an officer of the law

43
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:31,676
over three amateur sleuths.

44
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:34,345
Mom, you're the one who
asked Veronica to break in!

45
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:35,555
- Excuse me?
- What!

46
00:01:35,764 --> 00:01:37,140
- Alice?
- Actually...

47
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,059
I approached Mrs. Cooper.

48
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:42,353
I had to know if FP
was involved, and if he
was connected to my dad.

49
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:44,230
A gun was found.

50
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,275
FP is the killer.
Case closed. We're leaving.

51
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:48,610
There was no gun!

52
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:52,781
Son, this isn't
petty theft or a bar fight
we're talking about, Archie.

53
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,032
This is murder.

54
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,784
Okay, fine. Then we'll go
to the sheriff without you.

55
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:59,537
Archie, you entered
FP's residence illegally.

56
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:01,289
So whatever you did
or did not find there

57
00:02:01,498 --> 00:02:03,458
would be inadmissible
in a court of law.

58
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,959
I don't care
what happens to me.

59
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,462
I do care. FP may have
ruined Jughead's life,

60
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,838
I'm not gonna
let him ruin yours.

61
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:44,999
Hi, Mom.

62
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,211
Hey, guess what?

63
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:53,800
I got a bus ticket to Toledo.

64
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,887
Yeah. I thought I'd come see
you and Jellybean for a while.

65
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,057
I could crash on the couch.

66
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,146
Yeah.

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,567
Mmm-hmm.

68
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:13,027
No. I...

69
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:16,072
No, I understand.

70
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,533
Look, I...

71
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,119
Forget I said anything, okay?

72
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,580
All right. Bye.

73
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,003
<i>I changed my mind
about Toledo.</i>

74
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:33,882
Can you just
put me on whatever
the next bus out of town is?

75
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,050
I don't even care
where it's going.

76
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:39,846
Citrusville, Florida.
Leaves tomorrow
morning at 6:00.

77
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,181
Great.

78
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,686
Lobby closes
in fifteen minutes,
reopens at 5:30.

79
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:51,482
Mom?
What are you looking for?

80
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,776
- Our passports.
- Why?

81
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,988
Because Lord knows
what FP is going to say,
now that he's behind bars.

82
00:03:58,198 --> 00:04:01,284
So, you do think Daddy
hired him to kill Jason?

83
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,827
Honey, I don't know.

84
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:04,954
But, regardless of that,
we are known associates

85
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,956
of the man
who killed Jason Blossom.

86
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,834
Your father may have had
something to do with that.

87
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:13,296
Maybe not. But either way,
we need to be ready.

88
00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:15,548
Ready to do what?

89
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,843
Run away? Like we ran away
from New York?

90
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:21,429
- We're gonna look guilty.
- Baby, we are guilty!

91
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,557
I'm guilty.

92
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:27,477
I bribed the Mayor
to get the drive-in land,

93
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,355
forged your signature,
paid off the Serpents.

94
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:33,608
If that comes out, just...

95
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,903
Pack a bag, okay?

96
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:38,905
Just in case.

97
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:49,374
Come on.

98
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:52,669
From what he said in the hall,
it seems like he wants to get
to his mom in Ohio.

99
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,380
- Anything?
- No.

100
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,173
Maybe his phone died.

101
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:01,552
Or maybe,
the only friends he has
just completely betrayed him.

102
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,014
- Is that him?
- No, it's Veronica.

103
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,100
Hey. You okay?

104
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,937
Not really.
My mom's spiraling,
and I'm on the verge.

105
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,523
I just wanted to talk.
Where are you?

106
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:15,608
I'm with Betty.
We're looking for Jughead.

107
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:16,651
Wait.

108
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,404
You and Betty went
on a manhunt without me?

109
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:20,280
I'll come meet you.

110
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,406
<i>We're at the bus station,</i>

111
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:22,490
<i>but it's shut down
for the night.</i>

112
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:26,077
What's the one place in town
that's open 24 hours?

113
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:27,745
Hint, we were just there.

114
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,710
- Told you.
- Jug.

115
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,801
Jug, we're so sorry...

116
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,137
About everything.

117
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,143
Juggy, we screwed up.
We all did.

118
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,146
Breaking into your
dad's trailer was wrong,

119
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,814
but at least
some good came out of it.

120
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:57,525
Pretty sure my dad was
just arrested for murder.

121
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:01,571
That gun wasn't there
when we searched his trailer.

122
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,406
Someone put it there
after we left.

123
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,120
What are you talking about?

124
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,039
The gun we found
in your trailer

125
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:13,249
matched the bullet
that killed Jason Blossom.

126
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,171
So, did you know him well,

127
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,256
or did you just do it
for kicks?

128
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,262
Last summer,

129
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,308
<i>a redhead kid
comes up to me at the bar,</i>

130
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,684
<i>the Whyte Wyrm.</i>

131
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:36,439
<i>Said he was
planning to run away
with his pregnant girlfriend.</i>

132
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,150
- Polly Cooper.
- So I would learn.

133
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,362
He asked me to set him up
with a getaway car
and some cash.

134
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:44,530
We made a deal.

135
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,241
In exchange for some wheels,

136
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,995
and a tidy sum, he would
make a delivery for me.

137
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:52,663
<i>- Drugs?
- Mmm.</i>

138
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:55,333
<i>I got him a station wagon,</i>

139
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,210
<i>stashed some weed in the back.</i>

140
00:06:58,503 --> 00:06:59,379
<i>Then...</i>

141
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,465
I put two and two together.

142
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:05,843
Realized he was
Cliff Blossom's son.

143
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:08,554
I thought...

144
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,642
Kid like that has everything.

145
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,603
Why in the hell does he need
a guy like me?

146
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:18,231
Then he told me his plan.

147
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,109
On July 4th,

148
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,861
<i>his sister
was going to row him
across Sweetwater River,</i>

149
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,656
<i>tip the boat,
and say he drowned.</i>

150
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,244
<i>Once he made it
across the river,</i>

151
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:34,872
I grabbed him before
he reached his getaway car,

152
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:37,500
which he'd stashed
I don't know where.

153
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:42,004
And then,
I took him to the Wyrm...

154
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:44,924
Held him in the basement.

155
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:47,677
I kept him tied up
and worked out my plan.

156
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,303
Which was?

157
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:52,098
Get word to Cliff Blossom
that his son was alive,

158
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,891
and being held for ransom.

159
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,894
Set up a drop-off point
for payment to get him back.

160
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:59,689
Before I sent word to Blossom,

161
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,483
the kid got loose.

162
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,278
Tried to escape.

163
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:10,032
And that's when you shot him
and stuffed him
in the freezer.

164
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,710
Once things quieted down,

165
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:24,589
<i>and your guys were done
dragging Sweetwater River
for his body,</i>

166
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,258
that's when I dumped it.

167
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,553
The only place
we'd already looked.

168
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,641
You break into my house
and steal my files?

169
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:39,896
Yeah, I did.

170
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,026
<i>I even followed
my son and Betty Cooper</i>

171
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,403
<i>to Jason's getaway car,
and torched it.</i>

172
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:53,326
<i>You must've thought
you're real smart.</i>

173
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,079
<i>Now, I wanna hear you say it.</i>

174
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,502
Did you kill Jason Blossom?

175
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:13,804
Excuse me, sir.

176
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:15,139
We need to see Sheriff Keller.

177
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,016
There's been a huge mistake.

178
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,810
Sheriff, we need to
talk to you about FP Jones.

179
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,312
- What about him?
- He's innocent.

180
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:22,605
He's being framed.

181
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:24,774
Then why did he just confess?

182
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:05,898
Polly, the most incredible
thing has happened.

183
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,906
He killed Jason, not...

184
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:21,622
I went to the station.

185
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:23,916
I looked our son's killer
in the eye.

186
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,008
Finally, we'll have peace.

187
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,303
Jason will have peace.

188
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:40,057
And we...
We can all start over.

189
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:41,684
All of us.

190
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,403
The police report said
FP worked alone.

191
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,364
No mention
of your dad, Ronnie.
That's good news, right?

192
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:57,158
I can't
stop thinking that...

193
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,703
Maybe my dad hired
another Serpent
to plant that gun.

194
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:07,043
It's surreal, isn't it?
How's Jughead doing?

195
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,336
Not good.

196
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,171
He's not coming in today.
He's at the station.

197
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,590
- Being grilled by your dad.
- Who's just doing his job.

198
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,133
I mean, of course he's gonna
ask Jughead questions.

199
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:16,385
Okay, well,
he's wasting his time, Kev.

200
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:18,596
Because FP didn't kill Jason.

201
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,390
- Betty, he confessed.
- Or he was coerced.

202
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:25,269
Or he's protecting someone,
maybe a Serpent.

203
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:28,022
My mom saw him
and Joaquin together...

204
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,692
Don't! Do not drag
my boyfriend into this.

205
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,236
What're you...

206
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:35,738
- Oh, no.
- What?

207
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,284
What happened to him
not coming in today?

208
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,471
I'm sorry, Cheryl.

209
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,610
Enough!

210
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,573
Mr. Jones, you need
to come with me. Right now.

211
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,992
He was apologizing.
He didn't do anything wrong!

212
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,921
- Cheryl?
- I barely touched him.

213
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,057
It's not his fault, Cheryl.

214
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:48,602
Even if his dad
did do it, it's...

215
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,939
Everybody keeps
coming up to me,

216
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:54,191
and hugging me,

217
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,860
and telling me that
I must be so relieved

218
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,404
that my brother's killer
has finally been caught.

219
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,657
That this nightmare is over.

220
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,164
Then why doesn't it
feel that way?

221
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:21,469
What happened in there?

222
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,721
My second interrogation
of the day.

223
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:25,890
Don't know who's
more of a dick,

224
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,266
Keller or Weatherbee.

225
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,518
Don't listen to them.
Everyone else is wrong.

226
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,521
Your dad's innocent, and
we just need to prove it, Jug.

227
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,191
Who killed him, then, Betty?

228
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:37,526
Tell me.

229
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:41,280
If it wasn't my dad,
who killed Jason Blossom?

230
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,908
He said he did it,
and you know what?

231
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,659
I've been waiting
my whole life

232
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,703
for that man
to do the right thing,

233
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:49,038
and I'm done.

234
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,458
- You should be, too.
- Jug.

235
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,674
Yes, I... I appreciate it.

236
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:04,678
That was Weatherbee.

237
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,847
He's concerned for
Jug's personal safety.

238
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:08,933
After what happened
with Cheryl,

239
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,851
he's worried about the other
students' reaction to it.

240
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,021
Thinks Jughead should finish
the semester from home.

241
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,440
Jughead's getting kicked out
because Cheryl pummeled him.

242
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,608
How is that fair?

243
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,529
- It's not.
- Well, can we call, I don't
know, the school board?

244
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:25,950
Son, FP may spend
decades in prison,

245
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,451
potentially the rest
of his life.

246
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,537
We gotta think
of a long-term solution.

247
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,455
We are the long-term solution.

248
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:34,083
That's not how it works, okay?
I'm not his legal guardian.

249
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,501
Oh, good thing mom's a lawyer.

250
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,795
Archie, my priority
is keeping you safe.

251
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,005
Keep me safe
from who? Jughead?

252
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,340
Are you kidding me, Dad?

253
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:42,633
No, from whatever trouble

254
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:44,134
seems to follow
the Jones' around,

255
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:47,054
wherever they go,
whatever they do.

256
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:48,639
Hell, maybe you should
go to Chicago

257
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:50,015
and live with your mom.

258
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,229
It's not even something
I was considering, Dad.

259
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,648
But you know what?
Maybe I should.

260
00:14:57,857 --> 00:15:00,192
Hey, if it'll keep you
out of trouble,
I'm all for it.

261
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:06,407
Hey, Jug.

262
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:09,952
I'm gonna sleep
in the garage tonight. Okay?

263
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:11,537
Jug...

264
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:43,944
Did you hear that?

265
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:45,696
Mom, what are you
doing with that?

266
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:47,823
Get behind me.
Be ready to dial 911.

267
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,879
Don't move.

268
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,422
Hands where I can see them.

269
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:08,761
Don't shoot, Alice.

270
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:09,887
- Dad!
- Hal!

271
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,849
These are
Sheriff Keller's files

272
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,894
about the Blossom
murder investigation.

273
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,104
How did you get these, Dad?

274
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:20,439
<i>I broke into his house</i>

275
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:21,774
<i>the night
of the last drive-in,</i>

276
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,233
<i>and I took them.</i>

277
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,526
Well, that's impossible.

278
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,737
FP Jones already
confessed to that.

279
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:28,405
Well, I have no idea
why he would do that,

280
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:29,448
because it was me.

281
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:30,908
That's why I'm here.

282
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,952
To destroy any evidence
that could lead back to me.

283
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,787
Wait, that doesn't
make any sense.

284
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,790
Why would FP fess up to
something he didn't even do?

285
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,750
Yeah, I'm not thinking
about FP right now.

286
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,919
I'd like to know why
your father is stealing

287
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,588
and destroying evidence
in a murder investigation.

288
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:46,340
Look, I was worried
that the investigation

289
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:50,052
would get back to Polly,
somehow. To us.

290
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,263
And somehow Sheriff Keller
would figure out
the connection

291
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:56,392
between our family
and the Blossoms.

292
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,644
And he would think that
there was some kind of motive.

293
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:02,648
Wait, you mean about
Great-Grandpappy Cooper
being murdered by a Blossom?

294
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,444
Betty...

295
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:13,033
Your great-grandfather wasn't
just murdered by a Blossom.

296
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,245
He was a Blossom.

297
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:22,626
After the murder,
our family severed ties

298
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,336
with the Blossoms
and their name,

299
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,714
and we took a new one.
"Cooper."

300
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,299
I'm...

301
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,845
A Blossom?

302
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,431
Polly is a Blossom,

303
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:41,103
which makes her and Jason

304
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,731
relatives by blood.

305
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:50,112
- Which is why you wanted to...
- Yeah.

306
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,489
Alice, that's why.

307
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,285
Oh, my God, Hal.

308
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,328
If you're willing to send
our daughter away

309
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:01,582
to keep her away from Jason...

310
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,169
How far would the Blossoms go
to keep them apart?

311
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,629
We need to get Polly
out of that house.

312
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,186
Don't bother calling the cops.
We're not staying. Polly!

313
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,313
What the hell
is going on here, Alice?

314
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,647
It's the middle of the night.

315
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,150
Oh, sorry to disrupt
the witching hour
at Thornhill.

316
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,610
Polly, honey, are you okay?

317
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,820
Yeah, I'm fine.
Betty, what's going on?

318
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,405
We're here to bring
you home, Pol.

319
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:34,740
She's not leaving us.

320
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,658
She chose
to live here, remember?

321
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,494
With a mentally stable family.

322
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,121
Oh, I know all about
your family, Penelope.

323
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,540
- And the incest.
- What?

324
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,292
What incest?

325
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:49,129
Hal's grandfather wasn't
just your grandpappy's
murder victim.

326
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:54,009
They were brothers,
which made him a Blossom.

327
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,886
Just like Hal.

328
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:57,805
- Yeah, so what?
- "So what?"

329
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,264
So, everything,

330
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:03,060
starting with FP's confession,
has a few gaping holes in it.

331
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:06,980
He's being used by someone
with a crazy motive,

332
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,858
for example, hiding incest.

333
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,736
You were disgusted that
Jason and Polly were dating

334
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,446
because they were related.

335
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,532
Nothing could be
more purely Blossom

336
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,450
than those babies.

337
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:21,411
Okay, what is wrong
with you people?

338
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,705
Will you just spare us
the middle-class morality.

339
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,499
It's not like they were
brother and sister.

340
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,127
They were, what,
third cousins.

341
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,879
You think I killed my son?

342
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,090
That's it.
Polly, we are out of here.

343
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:38,512
Enough of this Doctor Moreau
experimentation in breeding
and eugenics.

344
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,805
It's over!

345
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,057
Betty, let's go.

346
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,934
You've made
a grave error, little girl.

347
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,479
No, I don't think so.

348
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:50,023
And I'm not gonna stop
until I prove it.

349
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:02,494
Juggy. Jug.
Wake up, we gotta go to Pop's.

350
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,332
<i>Archie asked me to look
into your father's case.</i>

351
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,711
I went down to the station,
and passed myself off
as his attorney

352
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,796
to try to get as much
information as I could.

353
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,007
How's it looking, Mom?

354
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:19,052
Well, unfortunately,
between FP's list of priors,

355
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,596
the anonymous tip,

356
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,097
and the possession
of the murder weapon...

357
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,349
Don't forget
that pesky confession.

358
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,726
Things look pretty bad.

359
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,645
I was with him all night,

360
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,439
and he never once
budged from his story.

361
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,068
Well, if nothing else,

362
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,904
at least
he's an honest murderer.

363
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,155
- Jug...
- Right?

364
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:44,036
Oh, also,
who is Joaquin DeSantos?

365
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,455
Joaquin? As in
Kevin's boyfriend?

366
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,292
He was FP's one phone call.

367
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,295
Jughead,

368
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:57,799
my advice to you is,
go and see your father.

369
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,718
Tell him everything
you wanna say.

370
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,638
Once he's arraigned,
things tend to move
pretty quickly,

371
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,473
and there won't be
anything left to do.

372
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,475
So, this might be
your last chance.

373
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,772
When Archie told me about
his little plan to help you,

374
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:17,110
get you on your feet,
and working with Fred,

375
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:22,282
deep down,
I knew it was a mistake.

376
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,742
Should have listened
to your gut.

377
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,494
You really had me.

378
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,458
Cleaning the trailer.

379
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,710
Convincing me that you
had quit drinking.

380
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:42,469
I was so happy,
for the first time in so long.

381
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,931
You paid attention to me.

382
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:47,849
Let's be honest.

383
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,102
The only reason
you even read my manuscript

384
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,687
about Jason's murder,

385
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,981
was to make sure
I wasn't onto you.

386
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,109
And you didn't want to take me

387
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,153
to Toledo to get the family
back together.

388
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,572
You wanted to get away.

389
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:05,033
You wanted to run away.

390
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:07,911
I did what I had to do!
What I always do!

391
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,998
Are you even sorry?

392
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,797
Sorry I got caught.

393
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:22,718
We done?

394
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,722
Look at me, Jughead!

395
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,854
Never come back here!

396
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:36,565
Understand?

397
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:45,574
Got it.

398
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:56,460
He called Joaquin?

399
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,670
Why not Jughead?

400
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,630
Or your dad? Or a lawyer?

401
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,591
- It's weird.
- What does Betty think?

402
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,509
She thinks it's weird.

403
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,514
Joaquin might know
if FP was hired to kill Jason,

404
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,016
if it was my father...

405
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,978
I need to see
this through to the end.

406
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,272
We know FP
used his call from jail
to get in touch with you.

407
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:18,940
What did he say?

408
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:20,442
It was basically
just a warning.

409
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,777
Said to lay low.

410
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,571
No one uses their one call
to say "lay low."

411
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,406
Joaquin, do you
know something?

412
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,201
I'm not talking to you
as your boyfriend,

413
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,827
I'm talking to you
as the sheriff's son.

414
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,579
Did FP kill Jason?

415
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,086
Yeah.

416
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,297
- I mean, I... I assume.
- Oh, my God.

417
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:43,715
Did you see him
pull the trigger?

418
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,133
No, no. God, no...

419
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,593
Then why
do you think he did it?

420
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:53,141
On July 11th,
I got a phone call

421
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,935
in the middle of the night
from FP.

422
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,063
Said he needed help
with some clean-up job

423
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,564
at the Whyte Wyrm.

424
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:00,857
What job?

425
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:05,695
The basement of the Whyte Wyrm
is off limits to everyone,

426
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,573
but that's where I met FP,

427
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:11,618
and that's where I saw...

428
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,083
<i>He'd been shot.</i>

429
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:22,003
<i>I never asked FP
if he did it. I just...</i>

430
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,881
<i>I mean, I was terrified.
I... I just assumed.</i>

431
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:27,467
<i>We stashed the body
in the freezer,</i>

432
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:33,723
<i>cleaned up the mess,
got rid of any evidence...</i>

433
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,857
You are a criminal.

434
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:47,028
Joaquin, FP has done jobs
for my dad, Hiram Lodge,
in the past.

435
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,949
Do you think killing Jason
was one of them?

436
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:55,620
There was one time
I overheard a conversation

437
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,164
between FP and Mustang...

438
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:01,251
- Who's Mustang?
- He's another Serpent.

439
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,087
The only other guy
who knew about the clean-up.

440
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,631
The guy you got
into a fight with at the Wyrm.

441
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:12,554
<i>I heard him tell FP
something about some rich guy.</i>

442
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:13,889
<i>I don't know who.</i>

443
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,891
- Where is Mustang?
- No, no, no, no.

444
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:17,601
You do not want to go see him.

445
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,227
Yes, I do.

446
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:20,979
And you're going
to take us. Or...

447
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,356
Or I'm going to tell my dad
about your little
clean-up job.

448
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:27,944
I'm so glad
that you're home, Pol.

449
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:30,739
And that you're safe.

450
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,825
And that the babies
are okay and healthy.

451
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:38,413
But God,
everything else...

452
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,208
Is the worst.

453
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,468
Betty, I saw my dad.

454
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,261
You were right.

455
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,722
He's hiding something.

456
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:07,901
Not that much money

457
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,778
in local crime
and villainy, huh?

458
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,696
This is him, here.

459
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:18,995
Mustang? You here?

460
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:39,307
Oh, my God.

461
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:51,361
- I can't... I can't be here.
- Let's go.

462
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,654
Call my dad.

463
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:06,042
- Son...
- I'm okay. We both are.

464
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,169
What were you doing here
in the first place?

465
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,505
We knew Mustang was a Serpent.
We just wanted to talk to him,

466
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,382
to see if he knew
anything about FP.

467
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:14,175
Veronica, this has to stop.

468
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:15,885
- Why are you doing this?
- Mom.

469
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,345
What do you think
happened in there?

470
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,888
Likely an overdose.

471
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,224
We're waiting to see
a time of death,

472
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:22,726
but it wouldn't
surprise me at all

473
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:23,893
if he was somehow involved
in Jason's murder,

474
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,520
and was feeling the heat.

475
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,480
And how'd you know
he even lived here?

476
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:31,359
Sheriff...

477
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:35,447
Found it under his bed.

478
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,368
Hermione Lodge?

479
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:41,953
Mind explaining to me
why your initials

480
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:43,288
are on this bag?

481
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:48,335
Not Hermione Lodge, Sheriff.

482
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:50,003
- Hiram Lodge. My dad.
- Veronica!

483
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,254
Mom...

484
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,090
He was doing business
with the Serpents.

485
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:55,383
And that's all we're saying

486
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,177
until there's
an attorney present.

487
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,239
This is exactly
what I didn't want to happen.

488
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,992
If you stay on this path,
you will end up dead.

489
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,619
Just like Jason Blossom.

490
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,580
You gotta believe me.

491
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,582
Okay? When I tell you
I'm trying to protect you.

492
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,751
That is my job.

493
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:32,754
It's the only one that counts.

494
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:41,554
- Do you got that?
- Yes.

495
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,866
Mom! Mom... Mom!

496
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:07,706
It's okay. It's okay.

497
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,461
You gotta tell your friends
to stop before they get hurt.

498
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,630
You really don't know them
at all, do you?

499
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:18,591
Just like I don't know you.

500
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:24,639
- Joaquin?
- Yeah?

501
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,607
I'm gonna miss you, Preppy...

502
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:44,951
Look, I didn't want
to say this

503
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,369
in front of your friends,

504
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:48,872
but there's something else.

505
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,501
My dad's been
lying to me his whole life,

506
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,128
but he's never been
any good at it.

507
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,756
I saw it in his eyes.

508
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,134
- He didn't do it.
- So, why lie?

509
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:02,510
Who is he protecting?

510
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,397
Mommy, that last morning,

511
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:16,608
before Jay-Jay
and I went to the river...

512
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,486
Why were he and Daddy arguing?

513
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,114
We've been over this.

514
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:28,369
Your father dedicated himself
to grooming Jason

515
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,079
to take over
the family business,

516
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:32,290
- but in the end...
- He couldn't stomach it.

517
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,125
When, really, I should have
been nurturing you.

518
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,836
Because Jason never
had the stomach for any of it.

519
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,422
But you... You're a Blossom.

520
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,425
I remember. He told me.

521
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:53,895
But why?
What couldn't he handle?

522
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,569
So many questions, Cheryl...

523
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:05,073
Okay, who can we rule out?

524
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:06,241
My dad.

525
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:09,327
We know why
he was acting so shady.

526
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:10,662
- Hermione.
- Yeah.

527
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,996
Veronica says
she's guilty of plenty,

528
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:13,706
but not murder.
Plus, she has an alibi.

529
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,542
She was in New York.

530
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,210
So, that just
leaves Hiram Lodge...

531
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,796
And Clifford
and Penelope Blossom...

532
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,803
I think something
happened, Mommy.

533
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,388
Whatever do you mean?

534
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,433
If Daddy wasn't mad at Jason
about Polly,

535
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,477
it must have been
about the business.

536
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,730
I don't know if he heard
something he shouldn't have,

537
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:39,899
or he saw something
he didn't like...

538
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,860
You don't know
what you're saying...

539
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:44,904
What was Jay-Jay
running away from?

540
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:48,074
The business?

541
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,993
Daddy?

542
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:53,955
You?

543
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:00,837
Ow!

544
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:09,345
You think
your father killed
your brother?

545
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,055
You think I did?

546
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,308
You think we murdered him
and threw him in the river,

547
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:16,811
because Jason knew
some deep, dark, horrible

548
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,646
secret about our business?

549
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,274
You want answers, Cheryl?

550
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:23,026
Are you ready?

551
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:27,030
There it is!

552
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:34,037
There's the sticky,
dark, dirty truth.

553
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:35,622
Maple syrup!

554
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,709
Drown in it, why don't you?

555
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,715
Well, what do we have here?

556
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,468
You two just can't leave
well enough alone, can you?

557
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,762
Mom, we know what
you're going to say.

558
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,306
The police found
another dead body.

559
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:54,390
Okay, maybe not that.

560
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,767
A Southside Serpent

561
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,518
and Sheriff Clueless
is convinced

562
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:59,312
that he was working
with your father.

563
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,940
He allegedly
committed suicide by overdose,

564
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,775
and there was
a bag of money on-site

565
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:05,360
that links him to Hiram Lodge.

566
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:07,362
Everything is tied up
into a nice little bow.

567
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,323
Too tidy, if you ask me.

568
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:15,495
Kevin?

569
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:20,458
Oh, okay.
We'll meet you there.

570
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,504
Whatever it is
we're looking for,

571
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:25,880
Joaquin didn't know
if it would help your dad,

572
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:27,215
or make things worse.

573
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,217
Um, guess
we're going to find out.

574
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:31,260
And why did he wait
so long to tell us?

575
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:33,054
FP called him from jail.

576
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,722
Told him to forget
about their plan,

577
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:37,892
some contingency plan.
He said it was too dangerous.

578
00:33:39,477 --> 00:33:40,687
Deja vu.

579
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:45,984
Hey, right here.

580
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:10,758
This is meant to help FP?

581
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:14,345
I don't know. Looks like more
incriminating evidence to me.

582
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:15,763
Yeah, this just confirms

583
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:17,932
that my dad torched
Jason's getaway car.

584
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:21,227
And that his confession
was true.

585
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:24,355
Why would FP say Jason's
varsity jacket is dangerous?

586
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:25,732
What could that mean?

587
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,442
I can ask my father.

588
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:29,360
He would know,

589
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:30,820
considering we found
concrete proof

590
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:33,531
that he hired
the Serpents to kill Jason.

591
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,034
Which probably means

592
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:39,203
that your dad
pulled the trigger, Jughead.

593
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:40,830
I'm sorry.

594
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:49,839
No. No!

595
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,383
No, I'm not giving up yet.

596
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,346
Put this on.

597
00:34:58,306 --> 00:34:59,682
- What?
- Put it on.

598
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:02,560
Betty, this is weird.

599
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,110
There's a hole in the pocket.

600
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:12,695
Okay, now we're just
grasping at straws...

601
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:14,322
Okay, no.
I don't know about you guys,

602
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,823
but whenever I have a hole
in my jacket pocket,

603
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:18,034
I always lose my chapstick
in the lining.

604
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,577
Or my Montblanc?

605
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,412
Hold on.

606
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,918
What the hell?

607
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:30,379
Nancy Drew strikes again.

608
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:56,781
Oh, my God.

609
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,088
Oh, my God.

610
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,560
Betty...

611
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:28,146
Betty, who are you calling?

612
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:33,359
You have to get out
of that house. Listen to me...

613
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:38,990
I understand.

614
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,159
Thank you.

615
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:30,541
Cheryl, what is it?

616
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,878
You did a bad thing, Daddy.

617
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:37,173
And now everyone knows.

618
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,230
Sheriff. Your office told me
that I would find you here.

619
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:54,440
You need to see this.
Both of you.

620
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:57,568
<i>That night,</i>

621
00:37:57,777 --> 00:37:59,070
<i>Sheriff Keller and Mayor McCoy</i>

622
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,197
<i>saw what we watched
in Archie's garage.</i>

623
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:05,868
<i>Jason, tied to a chair,</i>

624
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:07,370
<i>in the basement of a bar,</i>

625
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:09,455
<i>on the Southside
of Riverdale,</i>

626
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,250
<i>while a Serpent,
Mustang, taunted him.</i>

627
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,836
<i>Then, the unthinkable.</i>

628
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:20,341
Oh, my God.

629
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,452
Oh, my God.

630
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:06,429
<i>Later, we would learn why
my father confessed.</i>

631
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:09,473
<i>Because Clifford Blossom</i>

632
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:11,726
<i>visited him
on the night of his arrest,</i>

633
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,185
<i>with a threat,</i>

634
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:17,148
<i>that I, Jughead Jones,</i>

635
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:20,026
<i>would suffer the same fate
as Jason Blossom,</i>

636
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,111
<i>if my father didn't confess.</i>

637
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,073
<i>My dad was protecting me
from a monster,</i>

638
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,200
<i>and the nightmare
was far from over.</i>

639
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:30,036
...charged with tampering
with evidence,

640
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:32,246
obstruction of justice,
mishandling a body,

641
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:34,832
perjury, and that's just
off the top of my head.

642
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,501
He's not getting out
any time soon.

643
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:55,644
I'm sorry, Mom,

644
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:58,189
that I ever thought
that Dad...

645
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:00,816
Shh, <i>mija.</i>

646
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:03,152
Everyone makes mistakes.

647
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:05,529
I have good news.

648
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,783
Very good news.

649
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:11,202
Your father's coming home.

650
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:17,917
<i>And our families,
far from repaired...</i>

651
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,002
I'm sorry, Mom,
but my friends need me.

652
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:22,171
You should come
for the summer, maybe?

653
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,382
That'd be great.

654
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,471
- You be careful.
- I will.

655
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,390
You better.

656
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:34,809
I love you, Archie.

657
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,186
I love you too, Mom.

658
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:02,962
<i>And though
one question had been
answered that night,</i>

659
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,798
<i>that it was Clifford Blossom
who killed Jason,</i>

660
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:08,050
<i>a new mystery
loomed over Riverdale.</i>

661
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:10,886
<i>Why had he done it?
It was a question</i>

662
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:13,722
<i>only Clifford himself
would be able to answer.</i>
