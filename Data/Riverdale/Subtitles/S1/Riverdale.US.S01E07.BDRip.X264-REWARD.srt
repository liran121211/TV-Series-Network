00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:02,170
<i>Previously on
Riverdale...</i>

2
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:05,465
<i>The story is about a town,
once wholesome and innocent,</i>

3
00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:08,510
<i>now forever changed
by the mysterious murder
of Jason Blossom</i>

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:09,719
<i>on the 4th of July.</i>

5
00:00:10,136 --> 00:00:12,180
Your father hired
the Southside Serpents

6
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,391
<i>to decrease the value
of the drive-in's land.</i>

7
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:15,725
- Where is the rest of it?
- The rest of it?

8
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:20,355
- Where are you gonna live now?
- I'll figure it out, Dad.

9
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:21,690
I always do.

10
00:00:22,107 --> 00:00:24,484
<i>I saw you, Mom.
With Fred Andrews.</i>

11
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:26,987
Two signatures are needed
to award the contract.

12
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:28,405
Sorry, Mom, but no.

13
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:29,739
I don't want any part of it.

14
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:31,574
What's going on?

15
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:33,827
That SoDale contract? Awarded
to Andrew's Construction.

16
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,203
Looks like you won.

17
00:00:35,412 --> 00:00:37,497
You're...
With Jason's...

18
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:39,040
You just have to help me
get out of here.

19
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:41,292
I'll go to the car
on the lost highway
off of Route 40.

20
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:42,752
Is that Jason's jacket?

21
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,671
We need to get Sheriff Keller
and then we need to get Polly.

22
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,885
<i>What makes a
place feel like home</i>?

23
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:55,932
<i>Is it warmth and familiarity?</i>

24
00:00:56,141 --> 00:01:00,478
<i>Some idealized,
make-believe TV version
of the American Dream?</i>

25
00:01:02,397 --> 00:01:04,107
<i>Is it love and acceptance?</i>

26
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,278
<i>Or is it simple safety?</i>

27
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:34,512
Dude.

28
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:36,014
Why'd you stab me
in the back?

29
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:48,234
<i>Or it's none of those things.</i>

30
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:51,696
<i>And it's a place where
the captain of the
football team is murdered.</i>

31
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:56,659
<i>Or maybe it's just
a forgotten closet
under a well-trod staircase,</i>

32
00:01:57,452 --> 00:02:01,122
<i>where it's just you
and the mice and the spiders,</i>

33
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,958
<i>like an extra
in a Wes Craven movie.</i>

34
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:23,394
- Oh!
- Whoa.

35
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,606
What are you doing here?

36
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:30,693
Taking advantage
of the school's
state-of-the-art facilities.

37
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,739
No, really, Jughead.
What are you doing in here?

38
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,209
How long?

39
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,294
Well, since they shut down
the drive-in.

40
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:49,921
That's where
I was living before.

41
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,422
Why the hell are you
not living at home?

42
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:54,551
The truth is,
things aren't good at home.

43
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,302
- With your dad?
- Yeah.

44
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,179
He kind of fell off the wagon.

45
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,182
After your dad fired him,
to tell you the truth.

46
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,642
Hasn't had a job since.

47
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:04,853
He keeps promising
that he's gonna get
his act together,

48
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:07,564
but my mom couldn't take
that rollercoaster anymore,

49
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:11,734
so she grabbed Jellybean
and went to live
with our grandparents.

50
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:13,945
Come on.

51
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:15,989
God, Jug,
why didn't you tell me?

52
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,490
And where does your dad
think you are?

53
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,908
He thinks I'm couch-surfing.

54
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,077
Well, screw that.
Live with me.

55
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:23,538
This is temporary, man.

56
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:24,914
I'm going to figure
something out.

57
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,417
Just don't tell anybody.
Especially not Betty.

58
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,170
Betty?
She's not gonna care.

59
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,173
If anyone's gonna be
a snob about it,
maybe Veronica.

60
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:36,634
Right, well, exactly.
Don't tell her, either.

61
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:47,312
What's all this?

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,439
Some retail therapy
to salve my emotional wounds,

63
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,024
a few treasures
from Glamazon.com.

64
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,984
Smithers, be a love
and put those in my room.

65
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,572
Veronica, the nest egg
that your father left us

66
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,699
barely covers the rent
of this apartment.

67
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:01,534
We can't live
beyond our means.

68
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:02,827
Are you sure, Mother?

69
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:04,287
Not even with
your cushy new job

70
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:05,955
working for your high-school
boyfriend?

71
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,921
My mom and dad
don't want to get
the police involved.

72
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,964
They don't want anyone
to know that she ran away,

73
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:17,342
or about her
shameful condition.

74
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,385
Please.
What decade is this?

75
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:21,679
Also, since she knew
where Jason's getaway car was,

76
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:25,642
they're afraid people
might think that she burned it
and that if she did...

77
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,644
She could be the murderer,
trying to cover her tracks.

78
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,270
Who did burn the car, then?

79
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:32,023
Sheriff Keller
says it's possible
someone was following us.

80
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:34,984
Oh, my God.
Honestly, guys,
we should just move.

81
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,738
Guys, what if Polly's
really hurt?

82
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:42,075
What if whoever killed Jason
is coming after her next?

83
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:49,958
Betty, even though
your parents don't want to,

84
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,668
maybe you should
go to the police.

85
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,294
Second it. We can talk
to my dad together

86
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:54,754
about how he has
to be discreet.

87
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:56,965
No offense, Kev,
but your dad answers

88
00:04:57,173 --> 00:05:00,093
to a higher authority
than God, the Blossoms.

89
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,719
They're the first people
that he would tell.

90
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:03,888
And if there's anyone
to keep this a secret from,

91
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:05,765
it's the Blossoms.

92
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:09,352
They'd twist it around
and go after Polly
out of spite.

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,770
How can we help?

94
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,605
Tell us, B,
and we'll do it.

95
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:17,902
Hey, Juggy.

96
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:21,114
Remember before how you said
you didn't want Betty knowing
where you were living?

97
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:23,950
Is that because
you and Betty...

98
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,494
We may have had a moment...

99
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:27,704
It's totally cool, I get it.

100
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:29,289
No worries,
I'm just curious.

101
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:34,794
Hey, I've been thinking
about your situation,
and I talked to my dad.

102
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,754
He said he's willing
to give your dad
a second chance,

103
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:38,798
but only if FP wants it.

104
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:40,258
He's gonna call him.

105
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,719
But I think you should
talk to him, too.

106
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:45,221
Between the two of us,
I think we can really
make this thing happen.

107
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:48,558
Did I just notice
Riverdale High's
very own Holden Caulfield

108
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,727
put his arm around you?

109
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,646
Okay, so these past
couple of days,

110
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:56,858
I haven't been
in a great place, emotionally.

111
00:05:57,025 --> 00:06:00,445
And Jughead was really
there for me...

112
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,780
Oh, my God. Swoon!

113
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:05,491
Okay, in that case,
if he helped my girl

114
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,577
navigate some
turbulent waters,

115
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:10,496
well then,
Veronica Lodge approves.

116
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:11,998
Thatta girl.

117
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,834
Come on,
let's go find your sister.

118
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,171
Mrs. Blossom,
we've got forensics

119
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,465
going over every inch
of that car.

120
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,633
We're this close to a break
in your son's case.

121
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:26,262
Speaking of breaks,
what's a big one worth
to you, Mother?

122
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:28,473
Letting me be
a River Vixen again?

123
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:30,350
What on earth
are you talking about, Cheryl?

124
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,227
I have information you...
Both of you,

125
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:36,230
would find interesting
vis-a-vis my brother's case.

126
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,941
But first,
the Vixens are mine.

127
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,318
And I want your permission
to reclaim them.

128
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,779
- Good Lord, fine.

129
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:45,406
So, Ginger texted me while
I was in the ladies' room.

130
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:47,200
It seems that crazy bitch,
Polly Cooper,

131
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,286
escaped from some looney bin,
the same night Jason's car
was torched.

132
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,580
So let me do the math for you.

133
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:56,084
Polly escaping plus
Polly torching Jason's car
equals she's Jason's killer.

134
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,378
Covering her tracks,
trying to go underground,

135
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,547
like the vicious, cold-hearted
murdering mean girl
that she is.

136
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:04,217
Oh, and I just tweeted this
out to all of my minions,

137
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:07,220
so the pressure's on,
Sheriff Keller.

138
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,222
- You guys, oh, my God.
- What?

139
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,350
Cheryl just tweeted
#PollyCooperKilledMyBrother,

140
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,978
#NowhereToHide,
#SharpenYourPitchforks.

141
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:17,814
Oh, no.

142
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:21,150
We need to find Polly
before the Blossoms do.

143
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,223
The prodigal son returns.

144
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,149
How you doing?
You look good.

145
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:03,526
- I'm hanging in there.
- Yeah?

146
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,528
I came by to ask...

147
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:10,408
If you would consider
going back to work
with Fred Andrews.

148
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,787
Yeah, he called me.
I said no.

149
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,998
He fired me, Jughead.

150
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,626
What kind of man would I be
if I went back, hat in hand?

151
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:21,836
For starters?

152
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,214
A man with a job,
trying to fix his family.

153
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:26,549
Talk to your mom.

154
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,969
She's the one
who gave up on us,
took your sister.

155
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:34,056
Can you please
just go see Mr. Andrews?

156
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:35,391
He's willing to give you
another chance.

157
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,351
Oh, he's willing, huh?

158
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,105
That's generous of him,
after all the crap
he pulled on me.

159
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:45,818
Dad, don't you want to see
our family back together?

160
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,070
Mom and Jellybean
could come home.

161
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,322
I could come home.

162
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:52,909
It's not too late.

163
00:08:56,996 --> 00:09:00,333
Okay, the Sisters of
Quiet Mercy are due north.

164
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,960
The getaway car was west,
on the Old Route 40.

165
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,337
The closest bus station
is east,

166
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,214
headed towards Sweetwater.

167
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:08,424
If Polly wanted
to leave Riverdale
without anyone seeing her,

168
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:09,550
she probably
would've left through--

169
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,427
Right here.
Eversgreen Forest.

170
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,570
Hey, all this stuff
with your sister,

171
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,280
I'm sorry you had to go
through that,

172
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:32,949
and I wasn't there
to help you.

173
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,661
It's okay, Arch,
you're here now.

174
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:39,497
So how's the cold war
at home?

175
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:40,915
Ugh. Horrible.

176
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,375
Look, I hate fighting
with my mom,

177
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,961
but until she's ready
to admit and to own,

178
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,256
that she forged my name
to help her illicit trysting
with Fred Andrews,

179
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:49,549
I can't blink, Kevin.

180
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,384
She needs to make
the next move.

181
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,219
And what if she doesn't blink?

182
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:56,597
Back in New York,
whenever I needed
to blow off some steam,

183
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:58,474
or force my mother's hand,

184
00:09:58,683 --> 00:09:59,934
I'd go out on a bender,

185
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,603
dancing with my fave
celebrity gal-pal,

186
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:04,188
my best gay,

187
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:08,192
and some dim-witted, sexy,
disposable arm-candy.

188
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:10,820
- That's Josie, you.
- Honored.

189
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,155
And as for my arm-candy...

190
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,619
He'll do.

191
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:21,330
I'm in, I'm so in.

192
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,666
Should we invite Betty?

193
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,377
She could probably
use a distraction right now.

194
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:28,504
I think she might be
a tad busy.

195
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,731
Alice Cooper, where is she?
Where's Polly?

196
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:49,984
You think if I knew that,
I'd be out here
with the mosquitoes?

197
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,945
Face facts, Mommie Dearest,
Polly killed Jason.

198
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:55,615
She escaped from
the asylum once, who's to say
she didn't before,

199
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,908
say, the day
Jason got murdered?

200
00:10:58,117 --> 00:11:01,454
The noose is tightening
around your murdering
daughter's neck.

201
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,790
- I know it,
Sheriff Keller knows it.
- Hold on now.

202
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,501
And I promise you,
when we find her,

203
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,086
and we will find her,

204
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:11,797
the entire town of Riverdale
will know, too.

205
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,968
Mom, is this a good idea?

206
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,345
I thought we were trying
to contain this.

207
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:18,929
Well, we were, Elizabeth.

208
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,348
But now that
the cat's out of the bag,

209
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,266
we're in full-on
damage-control mode.

210
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,685
The Blossoms have their
version of the events,

211
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:27,605
but they don't know
the whole story,
at least not yet.

212
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,232
And that gives us
a momentary advantage.

213
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:31,859
I don't know if I can do this.

214
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:34,612
Oh, you can, and you will.

215
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,822
You'll be standing right
beside me and your father,

216
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:39,992
a united front against
the holiest of backdrops.

217
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:42,995
Let's see the Blossoms
try to smear us then.

218
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,875
There's been a swirl
of rumors today
about our daughter, Polly.

219
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:51,420
And we're standing here
to tell you that
they're all false.

220
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:56,008
Yes, Polly was seeking
treatment in a private
care facility,

221
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:59,095
and she was under
strict observation

222
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,889
even at the time
of Jason Blossom's death.

223
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:04,225
When she found out
about the murder,

224
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,686
she was beside
herself with grief.

225
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:11,273
You see, my daughter, Polly,

226
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:14,443
is pregnant with
Jason Blossom's baby.

227
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,991
Polly wouldn't hurt a fly,

228
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,703
let alone the father
of her unborn child.

229
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,583
Polly, darling,
if you're watching this,

230
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:32,878
please come home.

231
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:37,675
Hey, you didn't have
to walk me home.

232
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,636
Uh, there's a killer
on the loose, remember?

233
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,890
Besides, isn't this what...

234
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,601
You know...

235
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,149
What people like us,

236
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,818
who've gone through
what we've gone through, do?

237
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:02,408
What is it?
I mean, besides everything.

238
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:08,289
She wouldn't have run away
if it wasn't for me, Jug.

239
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:14,336
Betty, your parents
were the ones lying to her,
and keeping her in the dark.

240
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,756
You did the right thing
telling her the truth.

241
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:24,764
It's funny.
This isn't the first time
Polly's run away from home.

242
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:28,726
When she was nine,
she and my mom
got in this huge fight,

243
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,519
and she disappeared for hours.

244
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:32,813
The whole neighborhood
was out looking for her.

245
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,398
How far did she get?

246
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,194
What?

247
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:45,493
Thank you
for walking me home.

248
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,037
I'll call you later.
Goodnight.

249
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,546
Mom? Dad?

250
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,318
Polly?

251
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,781
It's okay. I'm alone.

252
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,450
Mom and Dad aren't here.

253
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,138
Shh.

254
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:53,102
Betty, you have to help me.
Please.

255
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,860
How did you get up here
without anyone seeing you?

256
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,903
I wrote the book on getting
in and out of this house.

257
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:04,905
And Dad still hasn't fixed
the cellar door.

258
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:06,991
Polly, everyone's
worried sick,

259
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,451
why did you leave the home?
You could have really
hurt yourself.

260
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,995
I couldn't just stay there,

261
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:13,581
waiting for someone
who was never gonna show.

262
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:18,210
Jason and I, we had a plan
to go to this farm, upstate,
and raise the baby.

263
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,797
It's where I still want to go,
but I don't have any money,
I don't have anything.

264
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,507
Why don't you
just stay here?

265
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:25,509
Mom and Dad want me to give
the baby up for adoption,

266
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:28,012
they made that very clear.
And that's not what I want.

267
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,930
Well, this is
their grandchild, Polly.

268
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,473
Everyone knows
you're pregnant now.

269
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,933
There's no more stigma.

270
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,602
You don't know
what they'll do.

271
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:38,272
And I won't have my baby
raised in a home
that doesn't want it.

272
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,607
Polly...

273
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,109
Give me a few days.

274
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:44,653
I'll find you someplace safe,
here in Riverdale.

275
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,740
Please, Polly,
I cannot lose you again.

276
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,749
This is an upgrade
from the tin can
we used to work in.

277
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,168
Wasn't sure you were gonna
take me up on the offer.

278
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,669
Wasn't sure it was real.

279
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,963
I'm not gonna lie to you,
it wasn't my idea.

280
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,507
The boys came up with this.

281
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:08,636
But I probably could
have reached out before.

282
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:13,432
Look, coming back here
isn't easy for me.

283
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:14,600
But, hell, I...

284
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:21,982
I just want my son
to look at me and not see
a piece of garbage.

285
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,110
Feels like it might be
my last shot.

286
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,656
Then let's make it work.

287
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:34,745
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

288
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:38,082
Hermione, you remember
FP Jones from high school.

289
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,625
- He's gonna be
working with us.

290
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,751
- Hermione.
- Of course.

291
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,169
- It's been forever. Hi.
- Hi.

292
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:44,964
Excuse me.
Yeah, Vic, talk to me.

293
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,927
Look, if this is another
shake-down...

294
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,303
No, it's not, we're good.

295
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,389
Your convict husband
settled-up.

296
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,849
I think he got the message
after you got
our little care-package.

297
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,351
Why are you even here?

298
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,478
My son asked me to try
and go straight, okay?

299
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:00,980
You gonna make that
hard on me?

300
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,690
Dudley-Do-Right
doesn't know I'm a Serpent,

301
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:05,025
so I'd appreciate it
if you keep that to yourself.

302
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,695
Because here's the thing
about snakes.

303
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:10,155
You don't step on them,
they got no reason to bite.

304
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,203
Mom, Dad,
when we find Polly,

305
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:18,872
she's gonna
live with us, right?

306
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:24,878
At this point,
there's no reason to hide
or banish her, is there?

307
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:27,756
Oh, of course not, honey.
She's welcome back.

308
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,720
Where will the baby sleep?

309
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,889
Sweetie, um, we've talked
to your sister about this,

310
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,392
and she's agreed to put
the baby up for adoption.

311
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,477
Polly did?

312
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:45,065
This is a very difficult
decision for a young
mother to make,

313
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:48,777
but given the circumstances,
it's the best.

314
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:52,156
- The only...
- The only option.

315
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,410
Why do you ask, honey?

316
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:02,041
No reason.
Just curious.

317
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,918
I don't want Polly
to run away.

318
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,962
But if she can't
live at home, then...

319
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:10,090
I don't know,
I can rent her an apartment.

320
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,842
Let me talk to my mom.

321
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:14,428
No, you have your
own stuff you're dealing
with right now, V.

322
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:18,265
Betty, Polly needs doctors,
she needs prenatal vitamins...

323
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:20,142
She needs her family.

324
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,899
What do you want, Cheryl?

325
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,817
What we both want.

326
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,113
For the baby to be safe.

327
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,158
How can I help?

328
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,994
You can't,
I don't trust you, Cheryl.

329
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:42,122
So don't trust me.
Watch me like a hawk.

330
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,791
Tell me the barest minimum.

331
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,459
But let me help you
help Polly.

332
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,835
You think Polly's crazy.

333
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:51,173
I do, I think she's crazier
than a serial killer
on bath-salts, but so what?

334
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:55,135
She's carrying Jason's baby.
That trumps everything.

335
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:56,678
Do you know where she is?

336
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,306
If I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

337
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,683
- Oh, my God, you do.
- What? No.

338
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:04,603
Wow, you are literally
the worst liar
I've ever encountered.

339
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,271
Spare me the details, Betty.

340
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,316
Just tell me
how I can be of assistance
to my darling nephew or niece.

341
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:13,737
Okay, uh,
Polly needs money.

342
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,989
For a safe place to live.
And for medical stuff.

343
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,408
Cash? Is that all?

344
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:19,576
I can talk to my mom and dad.

345
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:20,994
What? No, Cheryl.

346
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,539
Jason's baby
is a game-changer.

347
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,124
We're all on
the same team now.

348
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,424
- Oh, how was
your first day back?
Oh, it was great.

349
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:37,136
Your dad is
the hardest-working guy
on the crew, as always.

350
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,304
Oh, in that case,

351
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:40,931
why don't we celebrate
to mark the occasion?

352
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,141
Yeah, Juggy and I
were thinking

353
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,559
the four of us could have
dinner or something.

354
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,227
Uh, tonight?
I don't know...

355
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,728
I'm game if you're game.

356
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:48,814
On me.

357
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:54,903
Anyway...

358
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:58,073
We spent the whole summer
fixing up that old VW bus.

359
00:19:58,282 --> 00:19:59,366
Yeah.

360
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,868
Remember what
we called it, Fred?

361
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,328
The Shaggin' Wagon.

362
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:04,955
The Shaggin' Wagon.

363
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:06,623
This was before
your dad had game.

364
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,292
Senior Year,
he started a band,

365
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,918
and then the girls
were all over him.

366
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,086
We were awful.

367
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,171
Yeah, yeah, we were.

368
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,589
Oh.

369
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:17,509
But it was great.
Best time of my life.

370
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:23,432
You know, your dad
was what is commonly known
as a BMOC, Jughead.

371
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,601
- Come on. The hell I was.
- In what way?

372
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:26,894
Football, for one.

373
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:30,022
He single-handedly
defeated our arch-rivals,
the Baxter High Ravens.

374
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,567
He doesn't care
about that stuff, Fred.
Football, sports.

375
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:34,985
Takes after his mom
in that respect,

376
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:36,361
and I mean that
as a compliment.

377
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,197
I'd rather see you
spending your time

378
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,742
writing, thinking up stories,
you still do that?

379
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,369
Nose in a book?
Typing away?

380
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,080
Yeah, yeah, Jughead works on
the school paper with Betty.

381
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:48,457
Betty?

382
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,251
Ooh.

383
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,212
Who is Betty?
Is that your girlfriend?

384
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,504
She's...

385
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:58,091
I wanna know
more about the band.

386
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,135
What was the name
of the band?

387
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,387
Ah, yeah.

388
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,348
It was called The Fred Heads.

389
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,100
Wait, the what now?

390
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,936
Yeah, that's why it doesn't
come up very often.

391
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,437
Oh, thanks, Pop.

392
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,649
Oh, come on, Fred.
This was supposed
to be my treat.

393
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,067
Hey, you get it next time.

394
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,529
Hey, excuse me. Pop?

395
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,990
We invited you guys out.
Let me pay.

396
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,367
Put your damn money away.

397
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,743
FP, take it easy.

398
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,538
You owe me this.

399
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:31,625
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

400
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,377
Go ahead.
You get this one.

401
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:35,963
You know, if I'd have known,
I would have gotten
another milkshake.

402
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,844
Where are you going?

403
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,013
And don't say clubbing,
it's a school night.

404
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:46,473
But that's exactly
where I'm going,

405
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:47,766
and do you know why?

406
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:49,476
Because I have a Get Out
of Jail Free card.

407
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:53,105
Okay, Ronnie, enough.

408
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,482
Checkmate.
What do you want?

409
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:56,858
For you to admit
what you did.

410
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,153
Fine.
I kissed Fred Andrews.

411
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,697
No, Mom, the other thing.

412
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,532
It involves you
forging my signature

413
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,493
to get Fred Andrews
that stupid contract
to build on Dad's land.

414
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,120
Veronica, I asked you
to sign that...

415
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,789
You broke the law, Mom,
and you used me to do it.

416
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,833
When Daddy finds out,
he's gonna think
I betrayed him.

417
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,710
He won't, I will tell him.

418
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,587
Really? When?
Right now?

419
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,006
Because I'll cancel
my plans for that.

420
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:20,799
You know it doesn't
work that way.

421
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,135
In that case,
I'll talk to you later,
my friends are waiting.

422
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,347
Ronnie, do not
go out that door.

423
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:29,308
Veronica!

424
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,141
Ah!

425
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,604
Mmm-mmm, girl.
You better hydrate.

426
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,107
You practically left
your body on the dance floor.

427
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,567
I wish, Josie.

428
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,778
I wish I could leave
my body sometimes.

429
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,030
Leave Riverdale,
leave everything.

430
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,490
Is any of this helping?

431
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:30,327
Going out, going <i>Black Swan,</i>
any of it?

432
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,289
When my dad got arrested,

433
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:37,417
the police, the lawyers,
the judge, the courts,

434
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,378
they took everything from us.

435
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:45,425
Our houses, our cars,
our club memberships,
our yacht,

436
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:48,387
even, I'm not kidding,
the clothes off our backs.

437
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:55,185
Anyway, my mom sat me down
on the edge of my canopy bed

438
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:56,978
and she told me not to cry.

439
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:59,856
Because there was one thing
in this world

440
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,150
that no one could ever
take from me.

441
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,361
- Not ever.
- Your trust fund?

442
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,280
My name, Reggie.

443
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:09,658
Which, after telling me
no one would ever take it,

444
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:12,536
that is exactly what she did.

445
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:15,831
Like it meant nothing.

446
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,543
Like it was nothing.

447
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,255
Like I was nothing.

448
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:37,227
Damn, Hoss, you're good.

449
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:38,937
Way better than your dad.

450
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:40,730
Hey, does Fred
keep any beer in there?

451
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,441
Uh...

452
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:44,943
Dad, don't you think
it's a little late? Kinda...

453
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:47,529
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, it's all right.

454
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,906
You know, I got a big day
tomorrow anyway.

455
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:54,286
Hey, Mr. Jones,
before you go,

456
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,163
- can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

457
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:58,957
Earlier tonight,
you said my dad owed you.

458
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,917
What did you mean by that?

459
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:04,671
Hey, Archie,
why don't we quit
while we're ahead?

460
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,799
It's just...
I mean, it's just a question.

461
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,469
Did something happen
between you two?

462
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:15,182
It's ancient history,
but your dad and me, we...

463
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,058
We started Andrews
Construction together.

464
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,393
You and my dad
were partners?

465
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,604
He wouldn't call us that.

466
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,940
Anyway, we, uh...

467
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,611
We struggled at first.

468
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,697
Fred, he just had you
and your mom to provide for,

469
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:35,452
I had Jughead and Jellybean
and their mom
and hospital bills.

470
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,663
So I took some odd jobs
that weren't exactly
on the level.

471
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:42,083
And sure enough, one of 'em
landed me in some hot water,

472
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:46,796
and your dad was good enough
to bail me out.

473
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:51,259
But then he said
we should part ways.
That I was a liability.

474
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:55,472
Made me sign a paper
saying the bail money was him
buying me out of the company.

475
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,682
Never mind that my share
of the business

476
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,644
was worth probably
10 times that, easy.

477
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,357
So that was that.

478
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:09,402
He went his way,
and I went mine.

479
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,698
You know, I think I need
something a little harder
than beer.

480
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,703
Clifford and I
were so relieved

481
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,915
when Cheryl told us
that Polly and the baby
are safe and sound.

482
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,583
And money won't be
a problem, Betty.

483
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:27,254
Not now, not ever.
Not with us.

484
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,549
But, of course,
we don't want to just offer
financial support,

485
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,801
we want to give Polly
all the emotional support

486
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,262
that a young
mother-to-be needs.

487
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:38,223
Where is Polly staying now?

488
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,936
I'd rather not say yet.

489
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,938
You understand.

490
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:49,025
Of course, but you and Polly
are part of the Blossom
family now,

491
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:53,154
and we will protect you
ferociously.

492
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,616
All you have to do is trust.

493
00:26:57,993 --> 00:26:59,035
Will you?

494
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,795
Jughead,
what your dad told us...
I had no idea.

495
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,297
Me neither.

496
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:11,840
Illuminating, isn't it?

497
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:17,012
My dad must've had
a good reason.

498
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,805
For screwing over my dad?

499
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,473
Are you ready to roll,
Jugs?

500
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,692
See you tomorrow.

501
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:38,742
I'm sorry, Ms. Lodge,
but your card's been declined.

502
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,076
Really?

503
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,455
And let me guess,
it's been reported stolen.

504
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,040
It has, in fact.

505
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:46,666
We're supposed
to call the cops.

506
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,126
Yeah, sure.
Call the cops.

507
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,669
We'll be happy
to tell them how old we are.

508
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:53,423
Or I could call my mom,
the mayor.

509
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,926
This should cover it.

510
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:03,767
Veronica, did your mom
cut you off?

511
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,352
She did.

512
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,354
- And that's a good thing?
- Oh, Reggie.

513
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:10,023
This is how
we Lodge women roll.

514
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:13,318
We feint, we parry,
we approach, we retreat.

515
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,737
We're like a cobra
and a mongoose dancing.

516
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,865
She blinked, which means,
I suspect,

517
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,326
that Hermione Lodge
is ready to negotiate.

518
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,371
Wow. Oh.

519
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:27,415
I'll sleep right here
on this couch,

520
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,209
you can have the bedroom.

521
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,044
I'm not gonna take
your bed, Dad.

522
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:33,630
It wouldn't be the first time
I crashed on this thing.

523
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,256
Ah, thank you.

524
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,135
If you stay... Are you?
You're gonna stay?

525
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,721
Don't be late for school.

526
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,556
It's all right.

527
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,934
I'm already way ahead
in all my classes.

528
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:48,061
Hey, I talked to Mom.

529
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,898
She got a job at a call center
to pay for her online classes.

530
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:55,985
I guess she's finally
going after her GED.

531
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:58,488
Jellybean is helping
her study.

532
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:01,658
By the way, Jellybean wants
to go with JB now.

533
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,868
She thinks it sounds cooler.

534
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:08,581
She's 10 years old and listens
to Pink Floyd on vinyl,

535
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,750
I don't think
she could get any cooler.

536
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:23,221
How was your jam session?

537
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,391
It was great,
until FP told us

538
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,893
you forced him out
of the company
he helped found.

539
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:33,857
That's his story,
wanna hear mine, hmm?

540
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:35,608
FP was a mess.

541
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,069
He was stealing
from the company
and selling stuff on the side.

542
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,197
All things considered,
I was pretty generous.

543
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:43,158
So generous you didn't
give him a second chance?

544
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:44,743
Of course I did.

545
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,787
You have no idea
how many times
I bailed that man out of jail.

546
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:51,416
Son, when someone is drowning,

547
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:54,711
you can try to save them,
but not if they're gonna
drag you down with them.

548
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,797
I did the best I could
for my family.

549
00:29:59,132 --> 00:29:59,758
For you.

550
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:06,222
Yeah, and who cares if Jughead
ended up drowning, too.

551
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,531
Reporting my American Excess
card as stolen,

552
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,116
well-played.

553
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,410
I thought you might
appreciate that.

554
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:30,872
Now, <i>mija.</i>
I've done things to upset you.

555
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,999
You've done things
to upset me.

556
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,710
So we're gonna deal
with this exactly
as your father would like.

557
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,670
With a negotiation.
I'll start.

558
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,174
I am working with Mr. Andrews,

559
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:44,636
and yes, we are developing
feelings for each other.

560
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,304
But I can't tell you
what it means yet

561
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:47,972
because I don't know myself.

562
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:49,182
What about Daddy?

563
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:54,145
He has made certain decisions
that have distanced him
from me, and this family.

564
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,439
So I need to make
certain decisions

565
00:30:56,648 --> 00:31:00,819
about my life moving forward,
what I want.

566
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:04,155
So, what, you want me
to accept your affair?

567
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:06,825
Until we get
more information, yes.

568
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:10,078
That is what
I'm asking you to accept.

569
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:14,040
Fine. Agreed.
Now, my turn.

570
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:15,667
I'm listening.

571
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,335
Whatever is happening
with you and Fred,

572
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:18,962
can't happen under this roof.

573
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,004
Agreed.

574
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:23,466
And you have to come clean
to Daddy about forging
my signature.

575
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,134
Lodge Industries
needs to partner

576
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:27,053
with legitimate businesses,
not criminals.

577
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:30,056
Understood.
I don't want Daddy thinking
I betrayed him.

578
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,059
I will tell him
about the forgery.

579
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:34,602
And say it was all my doing.

580
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,105
And in the meantime,
the online shopping,

581
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:38,982
the clubbing,

582
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,526
all that stops.

583
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,153
- Yes?
- Yes.

584
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:01,462
- Hey.
- Hey.

585
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:09,888
Uh, what's up?

586
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:12,432
I'm going to need you to come
down to the station with me.

587
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,277
Call my dad.

588
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:25,653
- Yeah, yeah.
- Of course.

589
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:32,702
Forensics came back
on the car.

590
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:36,915
Despite the fire,
we were able to pull a pair
of prints off the trunk.

591
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:38,166
Yours and Betty's.

592
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,834
This is, of course,
no surprise.

593
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:43,296
But what did surprise me
was this.

594
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,173
Your prints were on file

595
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,550
from an incident that happened
six years ago,

596
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,846
where you spent some time
with the Riverdale Juvenile
Delinquent Center for...

597
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:57,936
"Attempting to burn down
Riverdale Elementary School."

598
00:32:58,144 --> 00:32:59,395
I was playing with matches,

599
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,440
and that's a pretty tenuous
connection for a sheriff.

600
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:05,276
Well, Principal Weatherbee
also allowed me

601
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,445
to have a look
at your school records.

602
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:10,698
You have a long and
rough history, Mr. Jones.

603
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:12,116
Bullied a lot.

604
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:14,869
Yeah, my name is Jughead.

605
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,205
By the football team,
in particular.

606
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:20,291
I can only assume that would
have included Jason Blossom.

607
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,834
So how about this?

608
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:24,796
How about you tell me
your whereabouts
on the week of July 11th?

609
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,256
This is crazy.
You think I...

610
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:32,553
Jughead. A kid like you,

611
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:35,223
raised on the wrong side of
the tracks by a deadbeat dad,

612
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:37,642
bullied by kids
like Jason Blossom.

613
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,603
Who wouldn't want
to lash out at that?

614
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,941
I'm not talking
to you anymore.

615
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,275
I want a lawyer.

616
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:56,452
Cheryl, you've called Polly
a party girl.

617
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,247
Have you seen her take drugs?
Firsthand?

618
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,044
Um... I'm not sure, why?

619
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:07,422
Due diligence.

620
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,007
We wouldn't want
an unfit mother

621
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:11,426
raising our grandchild now,
would we?

622
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:15,847
No, of course not.

623
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:30,695
I didn't do it, Betty,
you have to believe me.

624
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:34,782
Of course, I was with you,
and I know who you are.

625
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,118
Those <i>Paradise Lost</i> kids
went to death row

626
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:38,369
because they wore black

627
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:39,829
and they listened
to Metallica.

628
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:41,789
I don't wanna become
a scapegoat.

629
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,541
I'm not gonna let that happen.

630
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:47,879
All the evidence against you
is circumstantial.

631
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,048
We're gonna get you
out of here.

632
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,218
Is my dad here yet?

633
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,137
Archie's here with his dad.

634
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:57,680
They're talking
to the Sheriff.

635
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:02,226
No one knows
where your dad is.

636
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:04,270
Jughead's not helping
himself in there.

637
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,731
I asked him for an alibi,
and he just gave me lip.

638
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,192
He was working for me.

639
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:12,028
Yeah, the week
of July 11th, was it?

640
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,238
Yeah, I had him tear down
some drywall for me.

641
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:19,619
You can provide me
with documentation
to support that?

642
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:23,081
I have to check my time cards.

643
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,299
Jughead!

644
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,468
I'm sorry.

645
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:37,678
I came as soon
as I got your messages.

646
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:39,514
My phone,
the friggin' battery.

647
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,432
I forgot to plug it in
last night.

648
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,937
- What the hell happened?
- Nothing.

649
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,605
It's fine now.

650
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:49,440
Mr. Andrews took care of it.

651
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,111
What jacked-up crap
did they accuse you
of in there, huh?

652
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,779
Those bastards trying
to throw you in jail

653
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,406
like they did your old man?
Well, screw that.

654
00:35:58,032 --> 00:35:59,909
I will rip Keller a new one
for trying to pull that...

655
00:36:00,118 --> 00:36:01,244
- FP, settle down.
- Hey! Hey!

656
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,788
This is my son,
he is my son, Fred!

657
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,456
You'd do the same
for your boy.

658
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:06,749
Dad.

659
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,962
Don't make things worse.

660
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,631
Please.

661
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:18,761
Yeah.

662
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:21,806
Yeah, all right, then.

663
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:25,852
You, uh,
coming home with me?

664
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:30,273
He can stay with us,
Mr. Jones.

665
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:32,984
We already offered.

666
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:35,945
Is that what you want?

667
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:42,994
Maybe that's for the best.

668
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,495
If you don't mind, Fred.

669
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:47,790
Whatever you want, FP.

670
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,585
It's between the two of you.

671
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,629
I'll go with you, Dad.

672
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,766
Son, listen to me.

673
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:11,272
I'm gonna do what you want,

674
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:14,400
get my act together.

675
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:17,153
I'm gonna get your mom
and Jellybean home

676
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:18,821
so we're all
under the same roof.

677
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,033
I promise. But I...

678
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,118
I just need a little time
to do that.

679
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:27,580
Not a lot, not long,
a month, two at the most.

680
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:29,832
Hey.

681
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:35,671
And then we'll be back
on track, all right?

682
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:37,340
You...

683
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:40,176
You believe that, don't you?

684
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:47,266
Yeah, I believe you, Dad.

685
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:00,780
All right.

686
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:28,516
Any minute now.

687
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,811
How do you feel?

688
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,481
Partnering with
Andrews Construction

689
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:38,150
was the right decision
to make.

690
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:41,612
And your father will either
see that or he won't.

691
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,366
Either way, I can live
with the consequences.

692
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,333
Hello.

693
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:56,419
<i>You're receiving
a call from</i>
<i>Penitentiary.</i>

694
00:38:56,627 --> 00:38:57,837
<i>Will you accept the charges?</i>

695
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,255
I'll accept the charges.

696
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,017
Looks like
you've done this before.

697
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:15,354
Yeah, well, FP's got
his tricks, I got mine.

698
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:17,857
Maybe I should've given him
another chance back then.

699
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:21,027
Either way,
Jughead doesn't deserve
what's happening to him.

700
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,195
It's the least I can do.

701
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,617
The Blossoms
should be here soon.

702
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:31,454
Once we've talked
things through with them,
we'll call Mom and Dad.

703
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:34,415
Are you nervous?

704
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,001
I'm thankful.

705
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:40,880
At the home,
the Sisters said each of us
had a guardian angel.

706
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,258
You're mine, Betty.

707
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,264
Cheryl...

708
00:39:57,897 --> 00:39:59,815
I'm so sorry about Jason,

709
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,609
I know how much you loved him.

710
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:07,406
And he always talked
about how much he loved you.

711
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,245
Cheryl, where are
your mom and dad?

712
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,959
You have to leave. Now.

713
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:21,295
My parents, I don't think
they want to help you.

714
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,713
What are you talking about?

715
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,048
They want you
out of the picture, Polly.

716
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,466
It's not safe
for you with them.

717
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,552
It's not safe
for JayJay's baby.

718
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,848
Where am I supposed to go?
I can't go back to the attic.

719
00:40:33,057 --> 00:40:34,767
No.
You don't have to, Polly.

720
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:38,145
And don't worry
about my mom, Betty,
she'll want to help.

721
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:40,523
Of course you can stay.
As long as you need.

722
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:43,025
Anything for
Alice Cooper's daughters.

723
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:44,527
Thank you, Mrs. Lodge.

724
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:46,278
- And thank you, Veronica.
- Yeah.

725
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,197
You're welcome, girls.

726
00:40:48,406 --> 00:40:50,074
And please, now that we're
going to be roommates, Polly,

727
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,325
it's Hermione.

728
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:53,119
Come, sit,
make yourself at home.

729
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:03,087
I'm sorry about my dad,

730
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:05,965
and your dad.

731
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:08,008
I'm not giving up
on him, Arch.

732
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:10,886
Not yet.

733
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,723
You think he'll show up
for work tomorrow?

734
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:18,978
You never know. I hope.

735
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:26,152
<i>Hope.
A word so close to home,</i>

736
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,695
<i>and as tricky.</i>

737
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:32,658
<i>As much as we wanted
Jason's killer caught,</i>

738
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:35,995
<i>and the town, our home,
to feel safe again,</i>

739
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:40,833
<i>with every day that passed,
our hopes dimmed
more and more.</i>

740
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,169
<i>There's that old,
cliched saying,</i>

741
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:45,754
<i>"It's darkest
before the dawn."</i>

742
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:47,423
<i>But sometimes...</i>

743
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:51,719
<i>There's just darkness.</i>
