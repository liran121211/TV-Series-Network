two need to check yourselves.

- No, save it.

Oh, Polly, come stay
with us at Thornhill.

528
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:58,813
Cheryl's invitation is genuine.

529
00:25:59,616 --> 00:26:02,600
Thornhill's gates will
always be open to you.

You would want for nothing.

here, with a bedbug-infested Trojan Horse,

533
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,596

and steal my daughter?

534
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,665
I didn't think you wanted her,

535
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:21,269

been exiled like some pariah?

Why is your own daughter
not living with you?

540
00:26:32,782 --> 00:26:35,950

foot in that twisted,

543
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,249

544
00:26:41,252 --> 00:26:43,524

there than with you.

546
00:26:45,064 --> 00:26:47,328

And if you hadn't, I
would've met up with Jason,

561

562

Or you might've gotten hurt or worse.

563

Honey, come home.

568

I promise you you'll
never feel that way again.

and make another appointment for me?

about? What appointment?

576

Before you sent me away, Dad made an
appointment for me to see a doctor.

He didn't even ask me what I wanted.

581
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:07,933
Dad, before you say anything,
I was trying to help.

582
00:29:07,935 --> 00:29:09,911
- It was reckless.
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

I didn't wanna believe that was true.

696
00:37:00,354 --> 00:37:03,922
I mean... [SIGHS] He's my dad, Archie.

697
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:07,259
I get that. I do.

698
00:37:08,963 --> 00:37:11,664
But, Jughead, you can
talk to me about anything.

699
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,565
You're like...

700
00:37:16,504 --> 00:37:18,137
[QUIETLY] You're like my brother.

701
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:21,974
Nice bro-whisper, Archie.

702
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:25,311
You are my brother.

703
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:28,647
And I'm here for you and your dad.

704
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:29,815
So what can I do?

705
00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:33,152
Pray for a miracle.

706
00:37:37,992 --> 00:37:40,793
The heat is on. If
the cops come around...

707
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,730
This is our insurance.

708
00:37:44,733 --> 00:37:46,697
In case everything goes to hell.

709
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,402
Here, stash it. Keep it safe.

710
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:55,074
How's it going with the Keller kid?

711
00:37:55,077 --> 00:37:57,376
It's good. He thinks we're legit.

712
00:37:57,379 --> 00:37:58,612
Right on.

713
00:37:58,615 --> 00:38:01,146
We're gonna need that
inside line with the Sheriff.

714
00:38:04,817 --> 00:38:06,117
What?

715
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,519
We got a problem?

716
00:38:08,723 --> 00:38:10,622
He likes me, you know... For real.

717
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:15,126
[SCOFFS]

718
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:17,329
[CHUCKLING]

719
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:18,964
Ah, you're breaking my heart.

720
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,633
We all got a part to play.

721
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:24,536
Including me.

722
00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:33,445
I've got calls into
Greendale and Centerville.

723
00:38:33,448 --> 00:38:36,148
Clifford Blossom couldn't have
hired every crew in the state.

724
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,318
In the meantime, we'll
just be a two-person crew.

725
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,019
FP: That won't be necessary.

726
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:43,555
You need a crew?

727
00:38:43,558 --> 00:38:45,924
My guys are always looking for work.

728
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:49,495
And you've never had a
better foreman than me.

729
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:54,466
I won't leave you hanging this time.

730
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:57,002
What if there's trouble?

731
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:01,173
We can handle trouble.

732
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,811
We're burning daylight.

733
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:07,770
Let's get going.

734
00:39:07,773 --> 00:39:10,307
I'll catch up. We're just
gonna get the paperwork done.

735
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:17,589
I asked around about those bruisers
going after your man's crew.

736
00:39:17,592 --> 00:39:19,491
Turns out they weren't local.

737
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:22,668
Why are you telling me, not Fred?

738
00:39:22,671 --> 00:39:26,298
One of my guys says he knows 'em
from a stint doing time up north,

739
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,866
in Montreal.

740
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:33,272
Pretty sure we both know
who has business in Montreal.

741
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:35,841
Hiram? But...

742
00:39:35,844 --> 00:39:37,609
Why would he...

743
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:40,131
Maybe he got a whiff of your
little romance with Freddy Andrews?

744
00:39:41,182 --> 00:39:44,483
But the real question
is, who ratted you out?

745
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,057
Mom had no idea, Polly.

746
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:55,027
Dad never told her. She swears it.

747
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:58,096
[SIGHS] I just...

748
00:39:58,098 --> 00:39:59,798
I can't believe she kicked him out.

749
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:01,567
She meant what she said.

750
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:08,172
She wants you and the baby,
or babies, to feel safe.

751
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:09,908
Which means...

752
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:12,744
You can come home now.

753
00:40:54,377 --> 00:40:55,676
I'm sorry, Mom.

754
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,726
I tried.

755
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:25,183
Polly, we're so happy you're here.

756
00:41:26,453 --> 00:41:27,920
I'm doing this for my baby.

757
00:41:27,923 --> 00:41:29,555
Of course.

758
00:41:29,557 --> 00:41:30,856
You made the right choice.

759
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:32,317
You'll be safe here.

760
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:47,429
