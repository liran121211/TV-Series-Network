345
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:21,892
I didn't choose Archie over you, Reggie.

346
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:25,482
Or over Jughead, for that matter.

347
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:31,117
Can you keep a secret?
One that only a handful of people know?

348
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:33,414
Yeah.

349
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:36,042
Turns out,
after Angel Tabitha's last visit,

350
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:40,092
I remembered what it was like
being with Jughead.

351
00:19:40,176 --> 00:19:41,553
And being with Archie.

352
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,560
And Archie and Veronica remembered
what it was like being with each other.

353
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,981
But Veronica and Jughead
had just starting a thing.

354
00:19:48,064 --> 00:19:50,027
And remembering all of that

355
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,744
sort of just took the pressure off of us
having to make a single choice.

356
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:59,961
So the four of us realized that we could,
and maybe should, just be...

357
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:01,798
together.

358
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:03,718
At the same time.

359
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,056
Are you saying that for the past year,

360
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:08,812
the four of you have been dating?

361
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:11,148
Each other?

362
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:16,075
It started innocently enough
with the four of us going on double dates,

363
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:17,868
<i>me and Archie, Jughead and Veronica.</i>

364
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:21,417
<i>And then it kind of
naturally evolved from there.</i>

365
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:24,631
<i>Some nights,
Archie would sneak into my bedroom,</i>

366
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:27,846
<i>and Veronica would go home with Jughead.</i>

367
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:31,854
<i>Other nights, Archie would
spend the night at The Pembrooke,</i>

368
00:20:31,937 --> 00:20:34,942
<i>and I'd go over to Jughead's.</i>

369
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,782
And sometimes,
more often than you'd imagine,

370
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:41,203
<i>I would find my way to Veronica's.</i>

371
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:47,006
Okay. But you guys never thought
about bringing me into the mix?

372
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:49,594
Veronica and I talked about it, of course.

373
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:53,558
A flutter bum like you? But you were
always so focused on basketball.

374
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:56,188
Trust me,
I would've made the time, Goldilocks.

375
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:57,984
But speaking of that...

376
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,074
I'd better get back to it.

377
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,624
I'm so glad I got to know you, Reggie.

378
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,252
This you.

379
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:11,758
And I think you're destined for greatness.

380
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,475
You too, Cooper.

381
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,247
Did Reggie go professional?

382
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:32,630
Yes. The following year,
he played for Kansas State.

383
00:21:32,713 --> 00:21:34,716
Then he got drafted by the Lakers.

384
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,432
During the off-season,
he would work at his family farm

385
00:21:38,516 --> 00:21:41,353
<i>until his folks passed away,
then he had to sell the land.</i>

386
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,821
[BETTY] <i>At which point, he started
coaching here at Riverdale High.</i>

387
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:48,742
He was buried in Duck Creek,

388
00:21:49,452 --> 00:21:51,455
next to his wife and his parents.

389
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:53,667
<i>He had two sons,</i>

390
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:56,381
who still run the used-car dealership,
Mantle Motors.

391
00:22:00,097 --> 00:22:01,807
We go to the Babylonium next.

392
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:08,278
- [VERONICA] How's that absinthe, Betty?
- It's delicious.

393
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:11,032
It's just a bit early in the day for me.

394
00:22:11,994 --> 00:22:16,710
Well, I want to prepare you,
because I have news.

395
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,173
That I haven't yet shared with the boys.

396
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:22,721
The final pieces
fell into place yesterday,

397
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:26,352
but I'm moving back to the City of Angels.

398
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:27,812
Los Angeles?

399
00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:30,066
Why? How?

400
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:33,990
Josie McCoy's words
about taking over Hollywood

401
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:37,330
have been ringing in my ears
since her visit.

402
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:40,920
So I finally called my good friend
Peter Roth,

403
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:43,926
and asked about getting a job
working for him in La La Land.

404
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:46,179
I've done the small-town thing.

405
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:48,058
I've done the theater-owner thing.

406
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:51,898
And I now know what I wanna do next.

407
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:55,404
- And what is that, Miss Lodge?
- I wanna produce movies.

408
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,996
And run a studio someday, just like you.

409
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:06,383
I can't tell you how excited I am
to begin this next chapter, Betty.

410
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:08,469
To get in on the ground floor,

411
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,724
learn the ropes,

412
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:12,895
work my way up
to being a studio executive.

413
00:23:12,979 --> 00:23:14,106
One of the gatekeepers.

414
00:23:14,189 --> 00:23:15,148
Wow.

415
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:19,824
Sounds like an opportunity of a lifetime.

416
00:23:20,408 --> 00:23:21,285
It is.

417
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:26,002
But I'm detecting something, Betty.

418
00:23:27,254 --> 00:23:28,673
I'm so proud of you.

419
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:34,684
Of all the things you've done,
of all the businesses that you've started,

420
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,816
this move feels...

421
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,532
the most right.

422
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:44,452
I agree.

423
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:47,666
Like it was my destiny.

424
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:49,754
To be in the movies.

425
00:23:52,425 --> 00:23:56,056
The only thing is,
California's so far away.

426
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:57,391
Betty...

427
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,444
It doesn't matter how far away we are...

428
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:08,244
we will always be in each other's lives.

429
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:11,751
I promise.

430
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:20,058
I always loved this theater.

431
00:24:21,603 --> 00:24:22,730
It had a good run.

432
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:25,777
Lots of kids made out here.

433
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,536
Lots of gum under these seats.

434
00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:34,668
And Veronica?

435
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:36,422
[ANGEL JUGHEAD]
<i>The summer after graduation,</i>

436
00:24:36,505 --> 00:24:39,553
<i>Veronica started as an assistant
at Silver Shield Studios.</i>

437
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:42,098
<i>But within a few years,
she was running the place.</i>

438
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:46,356
<i>She became known for her impeccable taste
and for taking risks on young, raw talent.</i>

439
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,157
<i>She won two Oscars and produced some of
the most iconic movies of our time.</i>

440
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:54,662
Vee was buried
in the Hollywood Forever cemetery.

442
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,471
I visited her grave once.

443
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:11,568
And went to some of her premieres
before that.

444
00:25:14,658 --> 00:25:16,620
She was such a force.

445
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,006
I wish...

446
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,354
I wish I had
kept in better touch with her.

447
00:25:34,985 --> 00:25:35,862
With everyone.

448
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:38,700
All of us. We were so close.

449
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:40,871
Inseparable.

450
00:25:41,455 --> 00:25:42,833
And then we just...

That's what today is all about.

00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:50,514
Remembering.

453
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,060
And getting one more chance.

454
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:57,167
And no regrets.

Our relationship is the most
thrilling thing I could've ever imagined.

We're always creating.

There's no separation
between our art and our love.

and feel free to buy a piece, or two.

In case you were wondering,

Cheryl had an incredible career
as a painter.

475

Her work was shown in galleries

Toni and Cheryl stayed together.
Moved out West together.
