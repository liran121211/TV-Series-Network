Nice to meet you, neighbor.

174
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,776
[Veronica and Kevin] Neighbor?

175
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,245
Reggie's bunking with us.

176
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,781
Yeah, he's gonna help
turn things around
for the Bulldogs.

177
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:43,217
Well, he's already
turned my day around.
[chuckles softly]

178
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,154
But fill us in, Reginald.
Where are you from?
What you do for kicks?

179
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:49,490
And do you like the movies?

180
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:52,693
There isn't a theater
in Duck Creek.

181
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:55,229
My family and I,
we don't have a TV set.

182
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:59,200
Oh, well, you must come
to the Babylonium here in town.

183
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,135
It's a movie palace I own.

184
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:05,339
I own my own business, yes.
[exhales]

185
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:08,042
Or if you're interested
in picking up some
part-time work,

186
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,211
I'm always on the hunt
for a few good men.

187
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:11,679
[Cheryl] You'll have
to excuse Veronica.

188
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,781
Clearly, she was raised
by wolves.

189
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,650
I appreciate
the, uh, invitation,

190
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:19,787
but I'm just here
to play basketball
and win games.

191
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,256
Speaking of, where's the gym?

192
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,657
[all] I could show you.

193
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,760
Come on. I'll take you.

194
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,764
[school bell ringing]

195
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,869
Don't I know you?

196
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,505
Weren't you the guy
who was supposed to help me

197
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:38,639
keep track of my homework
from afar?

198
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:41,041
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

199
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:45,379
[sputters] Tabitha, I...
I got preoccupied. I...

200
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,981
It's... It's okay.

201
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,816
It was actually much
easier to coordinate

202
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,285
with Principal Featherhead
than I anticipated.

203
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,654
So you are hereby absolved.

204
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:56,657
[sighs, chuckles]
Well, that's a relief.

205
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,529
So, tell me,
why are you so preoccupied?

206
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:02,296
Oh, I... I got a job.

207
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,497
I'm writing comic books.

208
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,799
Oh! How fun. What kind?

209
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,402
It's a broad range,
but I also got to meet

210
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:13,407
and start working
for a literary hero of mine,
Brad Rayberry.

211
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,009
Oh, my gosh.
I know Brad Rayberry,

212
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:18,078
I mean, not personally,
but I've read his books.

213
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:19,680
His stories.

214
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,081
You read science fiction?

215
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:24,385
I read across all genres,
including science fiction.

216
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:25,819
Say, would you want
to meet him?

217
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,623
Would it be an imposition?

218
00:11:28,657 --> 00:11:29,857
No, no, not at all.

219
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,060
It's, um... negative
perspiration.

220
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:33,694
[both chuckle]

221
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,095
I'm sure he would love it.

222
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,065
Okay. Great.

223
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,675
[romantic music playing]

224
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,209
Veronica. Hey.

225
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:50,612
Kevin.

226
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:53,347
Don't tell me
you're here to see
<i>Singin' in the Rain</i> again.

227
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,350
I would think you'd have
the whole picture
memorized by now.

228
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,118
I do, and I'm not. I...

229
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:01,055
I'm actually here because
I wanted to see about
getting a job.

230
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,490
At school, you mentioned
you were looking for...

231
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,025
A few good men. Yes, I am.

232
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,294
Since I called it quits
with the basketball team,

233
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:12,299
I've been looking
for something to do,
and I love the movies.

234
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,236
Well, that's my
biggest prerequisite.

235
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:20,341
And you're already
pals with Clay.

236
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:22,476
I am.

237
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,046
Well, he's up
in the projection booth
even as we speak.

238
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,749
But maybe you could
help me with something.

239
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:31,051
Yeah, with what?

240
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:34,822
Well, between us...

241
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:40,227
I happen to think Clay is...
extremely dashing.

242
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:43,797
I've been dropping hints
that I'm interested
in something

243
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:47,334
more than a professional
relationship with him.

244
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:49,803
But so far, no bites.

245
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,472
Maybe you could help me

246
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:52,741
suss him out a bit.

247
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:56,010
Um, do you mean, like...

248
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:59,380
Like is he
seeing anyone,
that sort of thing?

249
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:01,616
Yeah, maybe.

250
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,318
Well, in that case,
when can you start?

251
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,156
[whistle blows]

252
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,959
All right, you turkeys.
Bring it in.

253
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,629
We have ourselves
a new player.

254
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:17,632
His name is Reggie Mantle.

255
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,066
So let's see what he can do.

256
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,003
We are going to split up
into two teams.

257
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:25,406
Julian, you're captain
of one team.

258
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,441
Reggie, you've got the other.

259
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,109
Everyone else, pick a side.

260
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:35,382
Come on, guys.

261
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,217
We can't have a game
if it's three against seven.

262
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:44,224
We'll take Doiley too.

263
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:45,459
That'll be enough.

264
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,194
The water boy?

265
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,195
[Reggie] Yeah.

266
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,297
-[Julian] What is this, a gag?
-Can it, Julian.

267
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:52,933
Dilton, you up for it?

268
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,203
Well, come on.

269
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,174
[upbeat music playing]

270
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:12,853
[cheering]

271
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:17,858
[boys gloating]

272
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:29,269
[boy] Yeah!

273
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:44,885
[Frank] Thirty-eight, all.
Anyone's game.

274
00:14:52,627 --> 00:14:54,328
[cheering]

275
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:56,029
[grunts]

276
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:06,206
Let's go. Game point.

277
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:19,019
-[blows whistle]
-[cheering]

278
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,256
Yes! Yes!

279
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,226
[all cheering]

280
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,876
Guys, how about we get
some burgers at Pop's?

281
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,343
Reggie hasn't tried 'em yet.

282
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:50,752
Come on. It's our
post-practice tradition.
What gives?

283
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:52,052
Actually, I can't.

284
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,655
I got a bunch of homework
to catch up on.

285
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:55,456
No, Andrews, you're right.

286
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:56,891
It is tradition.

287
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:58,893
I'm hungry enough
to eat a horse.

288
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:00,562
Last one to Pop's treats.

289
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:02,963
[Reggie scoffs]

290
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:05,265
You can come too, pipsqueak.

291
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,147
[Cheryl] Gather around, Vixens.

292
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,449
Now that our team's roster
is finally complete,

293
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:25,653
and with my family's first big
booster event coming up,

294
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:29,757
it is time to assign each Vixen
to their respective player.

295
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,893
Wait. What do you mean,
"assign"?

296
00:16:31,926 --> 00:16:33,728
It means that you show
your particular player

297
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:36,163
extra-personalized support
throughout the season.

298
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,800
Baking him cookies,
wearing his jersey,

299
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,400
helping him with his homework.

300
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:43,003
I, of course, will be paired
with Julian.

301
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:47,675
And Toni, you and Archie
will be matched.

302
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:50,344
As for our new star player,

303
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:55,349
I was thinking Betty
could be with Reggie.

304
00:16:56,985 --> 00:16:58,553
[knocking at door]

305
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,734
Maybe we leave him a note
and try again tomorrow?

306
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,234
Yeah, that's a good idea.

307
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,706
Hey, maybe we can
go catch a flick.

308
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,475
I think the Babylonium
is playing <i>It Came</i>
<i>from Beneath the Sea,</i>

309
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:23,845
and Ray Harryhausen
did the giant octopus.

310
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:26,446
[chuckles] Oh, um...

311
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:28,315
Yes.

312
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:31,218
I would love to go
to the movies with you.

313
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:43,598
[both chuckle]

314
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,067
Toni.

315
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:49,069
What's going on?

316
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,974
We need to get real, Cheryl.

317
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:54,742
What about?

318
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:56,376
I can't do this anymore.

319
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:58,913
The Vixens.

320
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:01,181
Is this about being paired
with Archie?

321
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,550
Would you prefer someone else?

322
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:05,319
No. I don't want to get
paired with anyone.

323
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:08,121
That's the thing.

324
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:10,090
Baking for my own
personal meathead

325
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:13,427
is not really what I want
my life to be about.

326
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,396
This whole thing just
doesn't feel right anymore.

327
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,534
It's not me
or who I want to be.

328
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:21,401
A cheerleader.

329
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:23,437
I see.

330
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,742
Toni, this doesn't have
anything to do with me

331
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,510
asking you to go steady,
does it?

332
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:32,279
[Toni] No.

333
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:36,818
But now that you mention it,
I'm not the settling-down type.

334
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:39,687
And I feel like
I've lost myself.

335
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:42,724
I don't know.
This whole square scene
isn't for me.

336
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,559
I need to
figure myself out.

337
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,795
I'm sorry, Cheryl.

338
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:49,329
I just need some space.

339
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,973
Can we do
a double-size popcorn,

340
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:01,109
a large cola with extra ice,

341
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,442
two packs of
the Senior Mints,

342
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:05,212
a Butterflinger, a pack
of those Mint Bogos,

343
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,180
Three Buccaneers
and a Skit-Skat?

344
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:08,549
Do you want anything?

345
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:12,185
Uh, no, I'm okay. Thanks.

346
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,287
That'll be 75 cents.

347
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:17,357
[Clay] Here you go.

348
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:19,894
Perfect.

349
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,896
Keep the change.

350
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,564
-Enjoy the movie.
-Thank you.

351
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,736
Well, isn't that fascinating?

352
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,437
[Clay] What?

353
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,307
Jughead and Tabitha
going to the movies together?

354
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,512
I find that interesting.
Don't you?

355
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:40,247
Could be they both like
science fiction flicks.

356
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:47,354
You know, Jughead and I
were entangled for
a New York minute.

357
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:49,222
What happened?

358
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:51,826
-I ended it.
-How come?

359
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:52,727
He's plenty handsome.

360
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:55,362
I suppose.

361
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,700
But between you and me,
he's a total oddball.

362
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,702
Lives in a train car too.

363
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:04,471
I prefer my men to be
a bit more continental.

364
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,207
Worldly.

365
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,777
With an air of mystery
about them.

366
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:16,316
I... I should skedaddle
to the booth.

367
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,619
-Get the next reel cued up.
-[Veronica] Of course.

368
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:21,589
But Clay...

369
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:27,427
Just think about picking up
what I'm putting down.

370
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:38,472
[door closes]

371
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:47,414
Uh, what did you get
for problem four?

372
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,650
You know, you don't
have to do this.

373
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,855
What do you mean?

374
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:57,558
Oh, helping you
with your homework
is one of my Vixen duties.

375
00:20:57,592 --> 00:20:59,627
I'm also supposed
to discreetly find out

376
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,564
what your favorite
kind of cookie is,
so I can bake you a batch.

377
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:06,801
-You don't have
to do that either.
-Oh, but I do.

378
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:12,507
On the hush-hush.
It's sort of my
court-appointed punishment.

379
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:14,575
What do you mean?

380
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:16,443
Oh, I was ordered
to join the Vixens

381
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:20,548
to curb my unhealthy
physical urges.

382
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,052
Oh, you mean,
you haven't heard?

383
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:26,687
[exhales deeply]

384
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:30,558
Yeah, I sort of flashed
my underwear
on live television.

385
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:33,293
You know,
like Marilyn Monroe style.

386
00:21:34,262 --> 00:21:35,663
Is that how come

387
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:39,700
you and Archie have to have
your curtains closed?

388
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:44,005
Oh, no... [sputters]

389
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:45,573
Archie and I...

390
00:21:46,774 --> 00:21:49,877
Well, you'll probably
hear about it anyways.

391
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:54,916
We were basically caught
having a peep show
in our windows.

392
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:56,617
A peep show.

393
00:21:57,585 --> 00:22:00,588
Yeah, if you can
even call it that. [scoffs]

394
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:04,091
You know what?

395
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,394
I should...
I should probably go.

396
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:10,363
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Nothing happened between us.

397
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:12,633
We didn't. No, we're not...

398
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:14,969
-I'm completely...
-[Reggie] Yeah.

399
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,139
Still, I'm living with the guy.

400
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:21,309
And we don't go in much
for peep shows

401
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,244
and flashing panties
in Duck Creek.

402
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:26,714
So, it's... This is...

403
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:32,520
Consider yourself relieved
of your, uh, Vixen duties.

404
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:34,822
-Okay?
-But I... I...

405
00:22:52,306 --> 00:22:55,343
Reg, you, uh... You want
to grab lunch with us?

406
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,778
Thanks for the invite,
but I'm gonna pass.

407
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:03,084
Well, it wouldn't be
with the team.

408
00:23:03,117 --> 00:23:04,952
It would be with
my other friends.

409
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:07,387
All the same, I'm good.

410
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,525
[basketball swishes]

411
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,828
[Toni] <i>I want to try</i>
<i>something out on you cats.</i>

412
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:17,430
Ever since Featherhead
refused to publish
my Emmett Till article

413
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:19,267
in the <i>Blue and Gold,</i>

414
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,436
I've been keen to start
a literary society for
Riverdale's Black students.

415
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,573
A club that publishes
a journal

416
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:29,476
focusing on Black voices
and writing.

417
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,579
I think that's
an excellent idea.

418
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:34,115
Yeah, I've been craving
a forum where
I can publish

419
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:36,851
my literary criticism,
poetry and short fiction.

420
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:41,122
And this is something that
you would do in addition
to cheerleading?

421
00:23:41,155 --> 00:23:43,791
No, I gave that up.

422
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,426
What happened?

423
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,763
I joined the Vixens
for the wrong reasons.

424
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:53,034
It was because
I had a crush on a girl.

425
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,536
Cheryl Blossom.

426
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:58,339
But now that's over, so...

427
00:23:58,372 --> 00:24:00,942
Anyway, I think
publishing this journal

428
00:24:00,975 --> 00:24:04,078
could really make a difference
for the Black students
at Riverdale.

429
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:06,414
It would. Definitely.

430
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,282
But what happened with Cheryl?

431
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:09,417
On the level,

432
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:10,685
we're just so different.

433
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:14,722
She's rich, she's white,
she's a Blossom.

434
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:17,425
The whole thing,
it would just be impossible.

435
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:20,828
I mean, it's hard
but it's not impossible.

436
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:24,497
For Kevin and I,
we're also very different.

437
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:27,368
So everything's a conversation.

438
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:31,706
But he's up for getting
to know me and what
I'm all about, and vice versa.

439
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:35,643
I hear that, Clay,
but you're also both preppies.

440
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:39,046
So, at least you're starting
off on the same foot.

441
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,748
Fair enough.

442
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:43,483
I guess it all depends on
how much you like the person.

443
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:52,393
Kevin, you haven't
seen Clay, have you?

444
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:55,062
He's running late.
Had some stuff at school.

445
00:24:55,096 --> 00:24:56,998
Can we chat about something?

446
00:24:57,031 --> 00:24:58,299
Of course.

447
00:24:58,332 --> 00:24:59,734
[sputters] It's just, it...

448
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:02,603
It seems like you're coming on
really strong with Clay.

449
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:04,405
I might be.

450
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:06,507
Clay would never say anything.

451
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,209
But is that really appropriate?

452
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:12,680
[clicks tongue] Oh, Kevin.
Don't be such a wet rag.

453
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:16,784
What's wrong with a little
workplace flirtation?

454
00:25:17,885 --> 00:25:20,788
It's not like Clay
is even remotely interested.

455
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:21,555
He's not.

456
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:23,157
I know that for a fact.

457
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,291
Oh.

458
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:25,693
And why is that?

459
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:28,596
Because he's not attracted
to assertive women?

460
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:32,066
No, he's not attracted
to any women.

461
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,902
Neither am I, for that matter.

462
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:36,904
I knew it.

463
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:40,007
I knew you were both
secret friends of Dorothy.

464
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:42,043
You knew?

465
00:25:42,343 --> 00:25:43,411
How?

466
00:25:43,444 --> 00:25:45,346
You're both dreamy flutter bums

467
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:50,117
who can quote every line
of Norma Desmond's dialogue
in <i>Sunset Boulevard.</i>

468
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:53,454
If you knew,
why would you make
a play for Clay?

469
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:55,689
To test my hypothesis,
of course.

470
00:25:56,624 --> 00:25:59,560
You lucky dog. He is a hunk.

471
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:03,364
Say, what are the chances...

472
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,499
Clay swings both ways?

473
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:07,735
Uh, he doesn't. We don't.

474
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:10,037
Double-checking, that's all.

475
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:10,604
[chuckles softly]

476
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:12,073
You're okay with this?

477
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:13,307
Absolutely.

478
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,477
Kevin, the only thing better
than having a hunky boyfriend

479
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:19,146
is having hunky friends
who are boys.

480
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,584
The thing is, I've always had
more fun going out
with Tony and Tab

481
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:26,921
than, say, Steve and Dennis.

482
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,158
Steve McQueen
and Dennis Hopper.

483
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:33,861
Don't worry,
we'll get you up to snuff.

484
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:36,497
[sighs]

485
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:39,900
Oh, Kevin, I'm so excited.

486
00:26:39,934 --> 00:26:43,904
This hick town is finally
starting to feel like home.

487
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:46,575
[giggles softly]

488
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,609
[Frank] <i>All right, fellas.</i>
<i>Huddle up.</i>

489
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:50,144
<i>Julian has an announcement.</i>

490
00:26:51,513 --> 00:26:53,180
Tomorrow night,

491
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:56,650
my parents are hosting
their annual Bulldog booster
basketball mixer.

492
00:26:56,684 --> 00:26:58,819
This year,
it's also a fundraiser.

493
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:00,454
To build us a new gym.

494
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:02,189
Are the cheerleaders invited?

495
00:27:02,223 --> 00:27:03,457
Absolutely.

496
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,392
So dress spiffy.

497
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:07,128
Okay? Coats and ties.

498
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:08,162
Make sure you shower.

499
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,132
[clears throat]

500
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:18,172
And, of course, we'll be
welcoming our newest Bulldog
to the family, I suppose.

501
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:29,483
You know, that Blossom mixer
may sound a little stuffy,

502
00:27:29,518 --> 00:27:32,786
but they're always
a gas and a half.

503
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,922
Yeah, well, let me know
how that goes.

504
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:39,827
-You're not going?
-No, I can't be distracted.

505
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,396
The NCAA is giving out
scholarships for college,

506
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:45,966
and if I get one of those,
I'm made in the shade.

507
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:51,540
Reggie, no man is an island.

508
00:27:51,573 --> 00:27:54,842
Can't you do all that stuff
and still cut loose a little?

509
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:57,411
Hell, Julian made it seem like
you're the guest of honor.

510
00:27:57,444 --> 00:28:02,049
If that's what you heard,
you're a lot more naive
than I thought.

511
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:06,521
Why are you being
such a killjoy, Mantle?

512
00:28:06,555 --> 00:28:09,056
Why can't you meet
anyone halfway?

513
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,891
Meet halfway?

514
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:14,728
Julian and those guys
haven't taken one step
towards me since I got here.

515
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:18,832
And you haven't heard
anything I've been saying.

516
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:22,269
Sophomore year, I was recruited
by Stonewall Prep.

517
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:26,740
And I was juiced to be there,
but I never belonged there.

518
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,976
<i>And my teammates made that</i>
<i>very clear.</i>

519
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:32,581
[boy exclaims] Oh!

520
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:34,181
You guys like rice,
don't you?

521
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:37,117
Is that enough to take back
to your farm, yellow-belly?

522
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:39,521
[boy laughing]

523
00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:41,188
[Reggie] <i>And that was day one.</i>

524
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:45,159
During practice,
the other players
would foul me on purpose,

525
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:47,194
and they did whatever
they could to run me
out of there.

526
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:48,128
And guess what?

527
00:28:49,363 --> 00:28:50,798
It worked.

528
00:28:50,831 --> 00:28:53,267
So this time,
I'm not meeting
anyone halfway.

529
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:57,104
Not giving anyone an opening.

530
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:03,110
A chance to humiliate me
ever again.

531
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:05,913
All right?

532
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,781
All right.

533
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:11,952
Reggie...

534
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:15,756
I'm sorry that happened to you.

535
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,927
But we're not like that here.

536
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:22,162
Aren't you?

537
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,070
[students laughing, chattering]

538
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:34,041
Cheryl.

539
00:29:36,143 --> 00:29:37,646
Toni.

540
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,415
-Hello.
-How are you?

541
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:47,187
[exhales] I'm being stoic
and strong for the sake
of my Vixens.

542
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:50,625
-How are you?
-Well, I'm petitioning
for a new club.

543
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:52,893
And you,
as Junior Class President,

544
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:55,996
are in charge of the student
council's financing.

545
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,366
I was hoping you could help us
secure some funding.

546
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,635
What kind of club is it?

547
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:03,837
It's a literary society
for Riverdale's Black students

548
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:06,373
to share their ideas,
stories and writings

549
00:30:06,407 --> 00:30:09,243
with each other
and the student body.

550
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:12,346
A way to express ourselves
on our own terms.

551
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:15,583
That's a really wonderful idea.

552
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:17,084
I'll put the request
through today,

553
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:21,188
but Toni, everything has to go
through Featherhead, so...

554
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:22,657
I know.

555
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:25,259
And I appreciate you trying.

556
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:28,697
And if Featherhead
doesn't approve,
we'll make it work.

557
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:29,930
We always do.

558
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:32,366
Maybe a bake sale or something.

559
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,136
Well, I would contribute
my legendary cherry scones.

560
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,911
Toni, can I ask you a question?

561
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:50,250
Is part of the reason
you broke up with me
because I'm white?

562
00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:54,922
There was a lot
of reasons, Cheryl.

563
00:30:54,955 --> 00:31:00,094
All interconnected,
but that was part of it.

564
00:31:00,562 --> 00:31:01,962
Yeah.

565
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:07,234
I will try my absolute best
with Featherhead.

566
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:09,403
I promise.

567
00:31:17,478 --> 00:31:19,313
-[jazz music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

568
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:45,673
Fancy meeting you here.

569
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:47,876
Well, howdy doody, Betty.

570
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:50,277
And how's it going
being a paper shaker?

571
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,579
Oh, swell.

572
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:55,249
Werthers thought it would
help me burn off
some excess energy.

573
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:56,785
Grown-ups don't have a clue.

574
00:31:56,818 --> 00:31:59,086
No, they don't.

575
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,856
Anyways, I don't think I'll be
a Vixen for much longer.

576
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,223
And why is that?

577
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:05,292
Once my mother finds out
that I've been assigned

578
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:10,063
a basketball player
to take care of,
she will flip her lid.

579
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,337
[Archie] Oh, crap.

580
00:32:18,873 --> 00:32:20,941
Um, will you excuse me, Betty?

581
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:23,611
-I...
-I'll take it.

582
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:25,012
Thanks.

583
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:26,313
[Betty chuckles softly]

584
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:32,152
Archie. Your uncle's telling me
that you're sharing a room

585
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:35,623
with our, uh...
Our secret weapon.

586
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:37,424
Uh, you mean Reggie?

587
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:38,726
Yes, I am.

588
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,095
Well, as a former
Bulldog myself,

589
00:32:42,897 --> 00:32:45,132
I do appreciate the sacrifice.

590
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:46,967
Well, it's no trouble at all.

591
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,604
I'm cranked to do it, really.

592
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:50,605
Well, I know I couldn't.

593
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:52,941
I mean, bunking with, uh...

594
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:55,743
We look upon him
as a necessary evil, Dennis.

595
00:32:55,777 --> 00:32:57,010
A means to an end.

596
00:32:57,044 --> 00:32:58,278
She's talking about winning.

597
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:00,915
The Bulldogs must be
champions this year.

598
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:03,283
The town needs something
to rally behind.

599
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:05,653
And you know, Frank,
when you suggested

600
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:07,755
bringing on a Korean prodigy...

601
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:08,989
[chuckles]

602
00:33:09,022 --> 00:33:10,859
Well, I was skeptical.

603
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:13,026
But having seen him play...
[exclaims]

604
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,631
I now see how inspired
your thinking was.

605
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:18,298
Tell me something, Archie.

606
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:22,904
Does he, uh, actually
realize the opportunity

607
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:24,539
we're presenting to him
and his family?

608
00:33:24,873 --> 00:33:26,708
He does.

609
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:30,010
He just doesn't want
to fall behind on his...
On his schoolwork.

610
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:33,180
Good for him. [chuckles]

611
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:37,050
But, uh, well,
we don't care about that.

612
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:39,186
We just need him
to be a loyal soldier

613
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:42,189
and bring us
our championship trophy.

614
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:46,661
He does that,
preferably with a smile
on his face,

615
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:48,328
there'll be no problems for us.

616
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:51,164
And none for his family.

617
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,936
If you'll excuse me.

618
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:57,404
-I'm gonna get some fresh air.
-Yeah.

619
00:33:57,437 --> 00:33:58,372
Good stuff.

620
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,546
Well, Coach,
here's to a winning season.

621
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:06,380
[glasses clinking]

622
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:13,621
[Veronica] Reggie Mantle.

623
00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:17,025
And here I thought
you weren't
a fan of the movies.

624
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,092
I didn't say that.

625
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:22,095
I said we didn't have
any theaters in Duck Creek.

626
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:23,430
I stand corrected.

627
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:25,867
And the fact that I might
have been here tonight

628
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,537
didn't influence
your decision, I suppose?

629
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:30,437
If I'm being honest...

630
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,340
Oh, I insist upon honesty
at all times.

631
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:35,108
Not at all.

632
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:37,411
Truth is, I forgot
that you worked at this place.

633
00:34:37,444 --> 00:34:38,378
[chuckles]

634
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:41,583
I don't work at it.

635
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:43,116
I own it.

636
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:47,922
Now, what can I get for you?
[clears throat]

637
00:34:47,956 --> 00:34:49,691
A small popcorn?

638
00:34:49,724 --> 00:34:51,693
No butter. I'm training.

639
00:34:57,765 --> 00:34:59,099
Here you go.

640
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:00,668
On the house.

641
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:03,103
Thanks.

642
00:35:06,741 --> 00:35:08,442
How rude can you get?

643
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:10,979
Anyway, there's plenty
other fish in the sea.

644
00:35:11,012 --> 00:35:12,145
True.

645
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:14,281
But take a powder,
Herman Melville,

646
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:18,218
because that
is the real Moby Dick.

647
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:21,288
[Tabitha] Wow, this is like
the Orient-Express.

648
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,992
[Jughead chuckles]
That's exactly what I said.

649
00:35:24,025 --> 00:35:26,126
-Here you go. Yeah.
-Oh, thank you.

650
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,129
Um, I actually,
I brought you something.

651
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:32,600
Here.

652
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:33,968
This is for you to keep.

653
00:35:34,002 --> 00:35:37,805
<i>Darkwater: Voices from</i>
<i>Within the Veil,</i>

654
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,540
by W.E.B. Du Bois.

655
00:35:39,574 --> 00:35:44,512
-Du Bois. He is a sociologist
and a civil rights activist.
-Du Bois.

656
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:46,681
He's also one
of my favorite authors.

657
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:48,916
Wow, it's a great title.

658
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,585
Which one should I start with?

659
00:35:50,618 --> 00:35:53,353
Well, we've established
that you're a fan
of science fiction.

660
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:56,858
-Mm-hmm.
-And though it's more
speculative fiction,

661
00:35:56,891 --> 00:36:01,129
I would suggest a story
that Du Bois wrote
called <i>The Comet.</i>

662
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,564
-What's that one about?
-Oh, it's fantastic.

663
00:36:03,598 --> 00:36:06,299
It's, um, it's about this comet
that hits New York City

664
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:10,203
and it kills everybody
except for two people.

665
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:12,140
A man named Jim
and a woman named Julia.

666
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:18,046
And it's sort of about this
unlikely relationship that
develops between them.

667
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,985
And what's really interesting
is that Jim is Black
and Julia is white,

668
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:28,122
and it's sort of
one of the first times
an interracial relationship

669
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:31,258
has been depicted
in science fiction.

670
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,094
Well, it sounds terrific.

671
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:34,662
-Yeah.
-I can't wait to read it.

672
00:36:34,696 --> 00:36:39,033
Actually, I was thinking
that maybe we could
read it together.

673
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:41,736
Tonight. Aloud,
if you wanted.

674
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:44,204
Yeah, that sounds swell.

675
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:48,676
How was the mixer?

676
00:36:50,945 --> 00:36:54,314
It was dullsville.
Honestly, you didn't
miss out on much.

677
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:56,918
Hmm. How were the cheerleaders?

678
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:58,285
All dolled up?

679
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,523
I don't really want
to talk about it.

680
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:05,492
Hey, I'm gonna grab a shower.

681
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:19,640
Okay, you lug nuts.

682
00:37:19,674 --> 00:37:24,244
Coach is in a meeting,
so I'm running warm-ups today.

683
00:37:24,277 --> 00:37:25,646
Everyone good with that?

684
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:29,884
In that case, let's play ball.

685
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:32,553
[upbeat music playing]

686
00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:34,722
[boys chattering]

687
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:41,696
[grunting]

688
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:48,636
[Archie] Yeah!

689
00:37:50,138 --> 00:37:51,205
[Julian] Come on.

690
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,640
Hey, banana boy,
pass me the ball.

691
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:54,274
Pass me the ball!

692
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:01,348
[boys] Whoa!

693
00:38:02,216 --> 00:38:03,684
[boy] Man, come on.

694
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:07,588
[panting] Listen up.

695
00:38:08,923 --> 00:38:10,691
We are not doing this crap.

696
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,528
If you haven't noticed,

697
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:16,564
Reggie here is our
strongest player,

698
00:38:16,597 --> 00:38:19,332
our only shot at making
the playoffs this year.

699
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:21,468
So we're going to rise
to his level.

700
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:26,073
So if you don't want
to be chummy with him,
that's fine.

701
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:27,440
But the minute
we hit this court,

702
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:30,011
we are teammates,
fighting for each other.

703
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:33,581
If you can't get
on board with that,
the door's right there.

704
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,451
And that includes
you too, Captain.

705
00:38:43,356 --> 00:38:47,228
I hope this will suffice.
Funds for your new club.

706
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:48,963
Thank you, Cheryl.

707
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:52,667
[chuckles] I'm shocked
Featherhead approved
a Black literary society.

708
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,734
He didn't.

709
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:57,171
Those funds were earmarked
for... something else.

710
00:38:57,205 --> 00:39:01,374
But I believe your club
to be a much more
worthy endeavor.

711
00:39:01,408 --> 00:39:03,578
Well, I won't ask
any more questions.

712
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:05,880
But thank you.

713
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:08,481
Of course.

714
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,520
I look forward to reading
your first issue.

715
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:15,857
Cheryl, wait.

716
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:21,062
Yes?

717
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:23,363
What are you doing
after cheerleading practice?

718
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:27,835
No plans. Why?

719
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,504
If you want,

720
00:39:30,538 --> 00:39:33,541
maybe we could meet
at the Dark Room.

721
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,410
I would love that.

722
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,114
Do you mean to talk?

723
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:43,284
Yeah, about...

724
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:47,588
what it would mean
if we tried again.

725
00:39:55,529 --> 00:39:57,565
I didn't sock Julian for you.

726
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:02,803
I know you don't need saving.

727
00:40:02,837 --> 00:40:05,472
I did it for my own sake
and for the team's.

728
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:09,944
I didn't want to believe
you were right about this town.

729
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,583
But, hell,
maybe we are just as...

730
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,818
As messed up
as any other place.

731
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:21,454
I don't know. [chuckles softly]

732
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,836
Want to grab a burger
at Pop's on the way home?

733
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,572
Maybe we'll run into some
of the other fellows there.

734
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:41,842
Sure, if you're sure.

735
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,476
I am.

736
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:46,080
Just don't expect me to sit
with anyone or anything.

737
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,515
[laughs]

738
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:55,890
[Jughead] <i>Tabitha and I</i>
<i>stayed up till dawn,</i>

739
00:40:55,923 --> 00:40:58,092
<i>reading and discussing</i>
<i>Du Bois' stories.</i>

740
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:02,229
<i>The next day, I wanted</i>
<i>to tell Mr. Rayberry</i>
<i>all about my swell night,</i>

741
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:04,098
<i>so I went back</i>
<i>to his apartment.</i>

742
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,968
[door creaks]

743
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:10,871
Wha... What happened?

744
00:41:10,905 --> 00:41:15,576
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but Brad Rayberry is dead.

745
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,278
Wha...

746
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,080
[sputters] How did he die?

747
00:41:19,113 --> 00:41:20,748
He, uh, killed himself.

748
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:23,884
Hung himself.

749
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:25,419
He left a note.

750
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:28,556
"I can no longer
continue living this way."

751
00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:33,594
I'm sorry, Jughead.
I know that he was your friend.
