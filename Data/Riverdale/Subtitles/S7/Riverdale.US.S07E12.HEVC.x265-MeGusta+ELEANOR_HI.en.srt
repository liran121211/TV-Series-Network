Is it really so important
to do another milkman story?

00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:09,472
You know, since this whole thing started,
no one but you has believed me.

408
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:13,267
People were telling me
that I was delusional,

409
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,854
or that I flipped a lid,
or that I killed my parents.

410
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:20,733
To the point
where I started to doubt my sanity.

411
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:22,527
And now the milkman is dead.

412
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:32,954
And everybody is still trying to tell me
what happened and how it happened.

00:24:43,923 --> 00:24:49,178
of people telling me what I went through
and what I experienced.

416
00:24:52,682 --> 00:24:54,684
I wanna tell my story.

417
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,437
Or at least a version of it.

- I have an older sister, Polly.

this paralyzing fear that...

449
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:08,150
And that my mother and father
never stopped resenting me for that.

450
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:11,362
I mean, they were fine having me around

451

with my own thoughts...

454
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,915
it was, "Bye-bye, Veronica."

00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:31,882

to be anything like our parents.

in Dr. Kingsley's book that 81% of girls

experiment with other girls
before they turn 18.

[CLIFFORD] Oh, don't be daffy, man.

They'd never find a lawyer
to represent them in a case like that.

515

518

but we just finalized the papers.

Your new ringer from Boston, K.O. Kelly,

520
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:23,363
will transfer to Riverdale High
as soon as next week.

521
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:25,532
Once Mantle gets us
that win against Stonewall,

522
00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:29,369
we'll just swap him out for a normal,
red-blooded American lad.

523
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:30,370
A real one.

524
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:33,414
One that's just as good a player,
but more like us.

525
00:31:33,498 --> 00:31:36,584
I will send that Mantle packing.

526
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,881
Of all the no-good,
rotten things in this world.

527
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:44,843

disowns their own child?

528

what your middle name becomes?

529

530
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:54,853
I mean, we mothers were put
on this planet to nurture our children.

531
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:57,814
And here I thought
Penelope Blossom was bad.

repair the damage that you've done.</i>

00:32:36,936 --> 00:32:38,938
It is truly a miracle.

542
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:41,232

about something else,

[REGGIE] <i>They're planning what?</i>

After we play Stonewall,
Clifford Blossom is gonna cut you

546
00:32:55,663 --> 00:32:59,208
and bring in some goofball ringer
from Boston named K.O. Kelly.

547

548

549

Look, I'm in knots about this, Reg.
What do you wanna do?

550
00:33:10,178 --> 00:33:12,263
I wanna finish
what I was brought here to do.

551
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:16,684
I wanna lead the Bulldogs
to their first championship in a decade.

552
00:33:18,436 --> 00:33:21,648
- And I wanna do it as captain.
- That's what I want too.

553
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:24,067
Same with all the guys on the team.

554

00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:36,037
{\an8}What do you think, Mr. Fieldstone?
It's not about a milkman.

556
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,372
{\an8}It's about a mailman.

557
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:39,832
- In case that wasn't obvious enough.
- Hmm.

558
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:41,417
It's subversive.

559
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:46,047
But, uh, it's kind of cheeky,
and I like that.

560

Well, I don't know
how to tell you this, but, uh...

563
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:55,306
I think it's brilliant.

564
00:33:55,974 --> 00:33:58,142
Oh, gee. Thanks, Mr. Fieldstone.

565
00:33:58,226 --> 00:34:01,479
- We tried other things.
- We just kept circling back to, uh...

566
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:03,231
The mailman. Yeah, I get it.

567
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:05,358
It's a pretty neat work-around,
I must admit.

568
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:09,779
But Werthers and the powers that be
will not be as tickled as I am.

569
00:34:10,446 --> 00:34:13,908
If we publish this, it's gonna
thicken the storm that's coming.

570
00:34:13,992 --> 00:34:17,704
And believe me,
a storm is coming like the wrath of God.

A storm is coming.

572
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:22,041
Well, the way I see it
is we have two options.

573
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:26,045
We either bury our heads in the sand
and pray the storm will pass over us...

574
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:29,132
But like you,
I don't really see that happening.

575

and thumb our noses at it.

for the rest of the season, then I walk.
