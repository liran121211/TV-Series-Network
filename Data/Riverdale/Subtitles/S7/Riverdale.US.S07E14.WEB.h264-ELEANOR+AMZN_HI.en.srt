For the first time ever,

76
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:42,636
Principal Featherhead is open
to doing an original musical this spring,

77
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,181
as opposed to, say, <i>Oklahoma!</i>
for the millionth time.

78
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:48,350
So Kevin and I decided
to write a show about, well,

79
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:50,977
all of us and our lives at Riverdale High.

80
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,189
But Featherhead needs to see
a workshop presentation

81
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:55,857
before he gives it the official go-ahead.

82
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,735

are we playing seniors in the show?

so much more kicking for the storyline.

of the rest of their lives.

86
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:09,536
But, dramaturgically,
I'm still the new girl?

87
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,248
- "Coming in hot"? Does that make sense?
- And why am I a bit player?

88
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:15,500
I'm the best singer in this damn school.

89
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:18,085
- Fangs is the best singer.
- I'm the best singer...

90
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:20,755
You're also Archie's understudy, Julian.
Don't forget.

91
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:22,506
And Archie is the main character.

92
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,467

was about all of us.

93
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,512

to play glorified chorus girls.

a solo line or two in the closing number,

95

wait for it, prom night.

I'm sorry, Kevin, Clay.

98
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:43,192
I cannot, in good conscience,
participate in this.

99
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:46,695
In my opinion, there is no lower art form
than American musical comedy.

100
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:49,365
I'm gonna back-window it too.
I got the looks for acting,

101
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:54,119
- but I'm not much for singing and dancing.
- Okay. That's fine. Not ideal.

102
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:56,454
Clay and I
will write you both out of the show.

103
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:59,165
In the meantime,
everyone else is dismissed until tomorrow,

the "I want" song in a musical

108

tells the audience
what our hero is searching for.

Oh, I mean, I'm used to it by now.

329
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,835
- How's your mother doing?
- All right, I guess. Considering.

330
00:17:52,962 --> 00:17:55,005
- What about school?
- It's fine.

331
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:58,175
I'm working on that new musical
I told you about.

332
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:01,136
- The one about you and your friends?
- Yeah.

333
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,055
It's just a workshop right now,

334
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:05,556
but if Principal Featherhead digs it,

335
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,059
we'll do a full production in the spring.

336
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:10,979
I keep imagining you, me, and Mom

337
00:18:11,062 --> 00:18:14,065
in the audience,
celebrating my opening night together.

338
00:18:18,568 --> 00:18:20,737
Why don't you just come home, Dad?

339
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:22,948
Or just come to dinner?

340
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:25,993
Heck, one meal. It's all I'm asking.
So you can talk to Mom.

341
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:29,871
There's more to the situation
that you don't understand.

342
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:32,498
Like what? I want to understand.

343
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:35,876
It's adult stuff.
Serious stuff between your mother and I.

344
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:39,255
You, uh...

345
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:42,758
You stick to your musicals,
and your singing and dancing.

346
00:18:52,434 --> 00:18:53,977
Thanks for coming back in, ladies.

347
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,687
We heard your feedback,
accepted your challenge,

348
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,692
and last night,
after a fraught dinner with my father,

349
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,737
Clay and I regrouped and cooked up
a new song for the four of us.

350
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,238
[CLAY] We wrote it from the heart.

351
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:10,199
About people like us,
who have to be careful about who we love.

352
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,952
We'll kick it off,
then you two feel free to join in.

Kevin and Clay, wowza.

392
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:32,622
You completely captured the longing

393
00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:36,251
of being in a queer,
interracial relationship in the 1950s.

394
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:39,087
Dare I say,
this is going to be extremely powerful

395
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:40,839
once we put it on stage.

396
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:45,009
Oh. Um, Clay and I wrote this song
for you and for us

397
00:21:45,092 --> 00:21:47,386
to sing and enjoy in private.

398
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:49,430
It's... It's not gonna be in the musical.

399
00:21:49,513 --> 00:21:51,056
- Why the hell not?
- Why not?

400
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,766
Riverdale's too provincial.

401
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:54,935
I'm under enormous pressure
from Featherhead

402
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:57,729
to deliver something that's mainstream
and commercial, and...

403
00:21:57,812 --> 00:22:00,815
But maybe one day,
when the world's caught up to our song.

404
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:04,110
In that case, Kevin, Clay,

405
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:07,488
when the world does catch up

406
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:11,074
and this beautiful song
is included in your musical,

407
00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:13,035
Toni and I will be there too.

408
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:14,912
But in the meantime,

409
00:22:15,704 --> 00:22:18,332
we do enough play-acting in our real life.

410
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:20,792
[TONI] So with all due respect,

You were saying?

421
00:22:55,991 --> 00:23:00,287
Kevin's writing this musical about me,
and I don't know why.

422
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:02,830
The character he's writing
isn't the person I am.

423
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,583
He's got me picking between
Betty and Veronica in the show,

424
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:06,960
but for me, in real life,

425
00:23:07,043 --> 00:23:10,505
the choice is actually
between basketball and poetry.

426
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:13,716
Ah. The classic conundrum.

00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:17,260

A what now?

430
00:23:20,138 --> 00:23:21,848
Your dilemma is real, Archie.

431
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:27,520
But it's not about having to decide
between basketball or poetry,

432
00:23:27,603 --> 00:23:30,272
artist or athlete, Betty or Veronica.

433
00:23:30,356 --> 00:23:31,399
No, it's...

434

662
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,020
For what, Archie?

663
00:37:46,103 --> 00:37:47,605
I know I left you high and dry,

664
00:37:48,564 --> 00:37:51,358
but working on your musical this week,

665
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:54,152
it made me take a long,
hard look at myself.

666
00:37:55,028 --> 00:37:56,946
Forced me to make some decisions that...

667
00:37:58,156 --> 00:37:59,699
well, that I needed to make.

668
00:37:59,783 --> 00:38:02,619
Well, I'm glad some good came of it.

669
00:38:02,702 --> 00:38:05,121
As I'm sure you heard,
we're not doing <i>Archie the Musical.</i>

670
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:08,207
Yeah, I did. I'm all broke out
with the blues about it.

671
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,502
I was looking forward to seeing
how the whole shebang would turn out.

672
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:18,592
And what was that you were playing before?
For the musical?

673
00:38:18,675 --> 00:38:21,469
No, it's just something
I stayed up all night writing.

674
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:25,515
After my mom and I
had a long talk about stuff.

675
00:38:25,598 --> 00:38:28,893
Well, come on,
will you keep playing it for me?
