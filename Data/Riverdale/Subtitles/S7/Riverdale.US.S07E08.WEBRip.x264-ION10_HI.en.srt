We got the rest of the season
to dust ourselves off.

00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:55,736
- Get back on top.
- Not if we keep playing like pansies.

You're all a bunch of spineless,
pillow-soft chumps.

We're a panic and a half!

The Bulldogs? We used to be unstoppable.

23
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,886
Back when your dad played,
they were the champs, not the chumps.

24
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:23,432
Now, I know that you
don't wanna spoil that legacy.

What did Mr. Blossom want?

26
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:39,574
I finally convinced our lead sponsor

Kid who knows how to win games.

28
00:01:42,243 --> 00:01:44,163

I'll take any help we can get.

- A farm kid out of Duck Creek.

Went steady? How would that work?

It's not like you can pin me.

00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:41,139
it could be just for us.

Unless you don't want to.

That's just kind of a thing squares do,

50
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,367
That's a fair point.

51
00:03:00,243 --> 00:03:04,289
Anyway, it's kind of like
we're already secretly going steady

My dad was born here. I was born here.

Yes, ma'am.

What was that like?

67
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:22,329
The farm's everything we have.
It's our family's legacy.

68
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:27,000
My dad came home from the war with
a chunk of shrapnel stuck in his shoulder.

69
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:29,169
So it slowed him down.

70
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:32,965
I couldn't let the family business
fall behind, so I stepped up.

Doesn't the government help you?

The Army doesn't give us any money.
We're not considered eligible.

I was talking to Dr. Werthers.

He wonders if it might not be prudent
to get you exercising more.

some of your excess energy.

00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:11,777
If you might not fare better spending
more time with nice, decent girls.

102
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:13,404
Mm. Unlike Veronica.

103
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:15,990
Now, I've spoken with Clifford Blossom,

104
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:18,493
and he's going
to arrange it all with Cheryl.

105
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:21,538
Cheryl? What does Cheryl
have to do with any of this?

106
00:06:22,873 --> 00:06:28,795
Um, well, Dr. Werthers thinks,
and your mother and I both agree,

107
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,464
you should join...

108
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:33,133

{\an8}You find these ripe cherries,
knowing they're in the closet,

119

00:10:06,108 --> 00:10:08,402
Or if you're interested
in some part-time work,

170
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:10,571
I'm always on the hunt for a few good men.

171
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:14,450
You'll have to excuse Veronica.
Clearly, she was raised by wolves.

172
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,785
I appreciate the, uh, invitation,

173
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:19,830
but I'm just here to play basketball
and win games.

174
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:21,958
Speaking of, uh, where's the gym?

175
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:23,585
[both] I could show you.

176
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,463
Come on. I'll take you.

177
00:10:29,174 --> 00:10:30,842
[school bell rings]

178
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:34,596
Don't I know you?

179
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:38,851
Weren't you supposed to help me
keep track of my homework from afar?

180
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:41,854
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry, Tabitha.

181
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:45,274
I... I got preoccupied, I...

182
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:47,276
- I...
- It's okay.

183
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:51,280
It was much easier to coordinate with
Principal Featherhead than I anticipated,

184
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:53,824
so you are hereby absolved.

185
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:56,787
Well, heh, that's a relief.

186
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,457
So tell me. Why are you so preoccupied?

187
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,627
Oh, I got a job. I'm writing comic books.

188
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,754
Oh, how fun. What kind?

189
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:07,130
It's a broad range.

190
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:12,552
But I also got to meet and start
working for a literary hero of mine.

191
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:15,264
- Brad Rayberry.
- Oh, my gosh. I know Brad Rayberry.

192
00:11:15,348 --> 00:11:19,602
I mean, not personally,
but I've read his books, his stories.

193
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:20,937
You read science fiction?

194
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,023
I read across all genres,
including science fiction.

195
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:25,691
Say, would you wanna meet him?

196
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:29,987
- Would it be an imposition?
- No, no. Not at all.

197
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:35,035
It's, um, negative perspiration.
I'm sure he would love it.

198
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:38,038
Okay. Great.

199
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,131
Veronica. Hey.

200
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:49,925
Kevin.

201
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:53,638
Don't tell me you're here
to see <i>Singin' in the Rain</i> again.

202
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:56,266
I'd think you'd have
the whole picture memorized by now.

203
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,725
I do, and I'm not.

204
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:01,354
I'm actually here 'cause
I wanted to see about getting a job.

205
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,648
At school,
you mentioned you were looking for...

206
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:05,400
- A few good men. Yes, I am.
- Yeah.

207
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:07,735
Since I called it quits
at the basketball team,

208
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:12,283
I've been looking for something to do,
and I love the movies.

209
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:15,452
Well, that's my biggest prerequisite.

210
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:20,708
And you're already pals with Clay.

211
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,750
I am.

212
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:25,671
Well, he's up in the projection booth
even as we speak.

213
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,883
But maybe you could
help me with something.

214
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:31,136
Yeah, with what?

215
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:34,306
Well, between us,

216
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:40,061
I happen to think Clay
is extremely dashing.

217
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:43,398
I've been dropping hints
that I'm interested

218
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:47,110
in something more than
a professional relationship with him.

219
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:49,697
But so far, no bites.

220
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,867
Maybe you could help me
suss him out a bit.

221
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,910
Um...

222
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:56,412
Do you mean, like...?

223
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:59,415
Like, is he seeing anyone?
That sort of thing.

224
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:04,670
- Yeah. Maybe.
- Well, in that case, when can you start?

225
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:08,592
[whistle blows]

226
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:11,470
All right, you turkeys. Bring it in.

227
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:14,514
We have ourselves a new player.

228
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:17,184
His name is Reggie Mantle.

229
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:19,561
So let's see what he can do.

230
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:25,193
We are gonna split up into two teams.
Julian, you're captain of one team.

231
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:27,320
Reggie, you've got the other.

232
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:29,238
Everyone else, pick a side.

233
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:35,161
[Fangs] Come on, guys.

234
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:37,789
We can't have a game
if it's three against seven.

235
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:45,089
We'll take Doiley too. That'll be enough.

236
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,591
- The water boy?
- [Reggie] Yeah.

237
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:50,344
- [Julian] What is this, a gag?
- Can it, Julian.

238
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:52,680
Dilton, you up for it?

239
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:56,100
Come on.

240
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:58,435
- [boy 1] Let's do this.
- [boy 2] Yeah.

241
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,104
[rock music playing]

242
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:11,783
[cheering]

243
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:17,622
- Nice! Good shot, Julian!
- Ooh!

244
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:44,776
[Frank] Thirty-eight all! Anyone's game!

245
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,535
[cheering]

246
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,084
[boy] Good shot!

247
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:06,132
Let's go! Game point!

248
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,854
- [blows whistle]
- [boys cheering]

249
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,419
Guys, how about
we get some burgers at Pop's?

250
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:43,922
Reggie hasn't tried them yet.

251
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,220
Come on. It's our post-practice tradition.
What gives?

252
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:53,182
Actually, I can't.
I got a bunch of homework to catch up on.

253
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:55,309
You know what, Andrews, you're right.

254
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:58,938
It is tradition.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.

255
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:00,606
Last one to Pop's treats!

256
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:05,194
You can come too, pipsqueak.

257
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:19,418
[Cheryl] Gather around, Vixens.

258
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:23,004
Now that our team's roster
is finally complete,

259
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:26,091
and with my family's
first big booster event coming up,

260
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:29,303
it is time to assign each Vixen
to their respective player.

261
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,806
Wait, what do you mean assigned?

262
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:36,144
It means that you show your player extra
personalized support through the season.

263
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:40,648
Baking him cookies, wearing his jersey,
helping him with his homework.

264
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:43,151
I, of course, will be paired with Julian.

265
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:47,406
And, Toni, you and Archie will be matched.

266
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:52,327
As for our new star player,
I was thinking...

267
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:55,581
Betty could be with Reggie.

268
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,250
[knock on door]

269
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:12,765
Maybe we leave him a note
and try again tomorrow?

270
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,225
Yeah, that's a good idea.

271
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:17,187
Hey, maybe we can...

272
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:19,105
go catch a flick?

273
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:21,649
The Babylonium is playing
<i>It Came From Beneath the Sea,</i>

274
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:24,570
and Ray Harryhausen did the giant octopus.

275
00:17:25,488 --> 00:17:27,781
Um, yes.

276
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:31,118
I would love to go to the movies with you.

277
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:46,468
Toni.

278
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:48,887
What's going on?

279
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:53,850
- We need to get real, Cheryl.
- What about?

280
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,269
I can't do this anymore.

281
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:58,313
The Vixens.

282
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:02,860
Is this about being paired with Archie?
Would you prefer someone else?

283
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:05,363
No, I don't wanna get paired with anyone.

284
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:07,573
That's the thing.

285
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:12,370
Baking for my own personal meathead is not
really what I want my life to be about.

286
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:16,123
This whole thing
just doesn't feel right anymore.

287
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:21,338
It's not me or who I wanna be.
A cheerleader.

288
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:23,215
I see.

289
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:29,596
Toni, this doesn't have anything to do
with me asking you to go steady, does it?

290
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:33,559
No. But now that you mention it...

291
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:39,232
I'm not the settling down type,
and I feel like I've lost myself.

292
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:42,569
I don't know,
this whole square scene isn't for me.

293
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:44,529
I need to figure myself out.

294
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,115
I'm sorry, Cheryl.

295
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:49,576
I just need some space.

296
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,171
Can we do a double-sized popcorn,
a large cola with extra ice,

297
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:03,674
two packs of the Senior Mints,
a Butterflinger,

298
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:07,136
a pack of those Mint BoGos,
a 3 Buccaneers, and a Skit-Skat?

299
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:08,470
Do you want anything?

300
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:11,974
Uh, no. I'm okay, thanks.

301
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:14,351
That'll be 75 cents.

302
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:16,938
Here you go.

303
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:20,859
Perfect. Keep the change.

304
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:23,320
- Enjoy the movie.
- Thank you.

305
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:29,284
- Well, isn't that fascinating.
- [Clay] What?

306
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:34,123
Jughead and Tabitha?
Going to the movies together?

307
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,835
I find that interesting. Don't you?

308
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:40,630
Could be they both
like science fiction flicks.

309
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:47,219
You know, Jughead and I
were entangled for a New York minute.

310
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:48,721
What happened?

311
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,473
I ended it.

312
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,726
How come? He's plenty handsome.

313
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:54,770
I suppose.

314
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:58,482
But between you and me,
he's a total oddball.

315
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,067
Lives in a train car too.

316
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:04,488
I prefer my men
to be a bit more continental.

317
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:06,323
Worldly.

318
00:20:07,324 --> 00:20:09,827
With an air of mystery about them.

319
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:12,955
[Clay] I...

320
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,794
I should skedaddle to the booth,
get the next reel queued up.

321
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:18,711
Of course.

322
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:21,422
Clay?

323
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:27,303
Just think about picking up
what I'm putting down.

324
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,151
[chattering]

325
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:47,742
Um, what did you get for problem four?

326
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:49,869
You know, you don't have to do this.

327
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:53,373
What do you mean?

328
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:57,877
Oh, helping you with your homework
is one of my Vixen duties.

329
00:20:57,961 --> 00:21:01,423
I'm also supposed to discreetly find out
what your favorite kind of cookie is

330
00:21:01,506 --> 00:21:03,133
so I can bake you a batch.

331
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,637
- You don't have to do that either.
- Oh, but I do.

332
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:09,557
On the hush-hush, it's sort of my...

333
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,518
court-appointed punishment.

334
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:14,437
What do you mean?

335
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,860
Oh, I was ordered to join the Vixens
to curb my unhealthy physical urges.

336
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:25,574
Oh, you mean you haven't heard?

337
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:27,159
[sigh] Oh, yeah.

338
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:30,412
I sort of flashed my underwear
on live television.

339
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:33,498
You know, like Marilyn Monroe-style.

340
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:39,838
Is that how come you and Archie
have to have your curtains closed?

341
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:43,092
Oh. No.

342
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:45,303
Archie and I...

343
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,807
Well, you'll probably
hear about it anyways.

344
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,685
We were basically caught having a...

345
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,313
peep show in our windows.

346
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:56,522
A peep show?

347
00:21:57,815 --> 00:22:00,486
Yeah, if you can even call it that.
[scoffs]

348
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,072
You know what?

349
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,658
I should... I should probably go.

350
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,994
Oh. No. No, no, no.

351
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,996
Nothing happened between us.

352
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,790
We didn't... No, we're not...

353
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,917
- I'm completely...
- Yeah.

354
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,170
Still. You... I'm living with the guy.

355
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,547
And we don't go in much

356
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:24,511
for peep shows and flashing panties
in Duck Creek, so it's...

357
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,888
This is...

358
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:33,019
Consider yourself relieved
of your, uh, Vixen duties, okay?

359
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,687
But, I...

360
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,417
Reg. You, uh, wanna grab lunch with us?

361
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:58,129
Thanks for the invite, but I'm gonna pass.

362
00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:04,553
It wouldn't be with the team,
it would be with my other friends.

363
00:23:05,136 --> 00:23:06,054
All the same,

364
00:23:06,596 --> 00:23:07,472
I'm good.

365
00:23:11,643 --> 00:23:13,895
[Toni]
<i>I wanna try something out on you cats.</i>

366
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:17,692
Ever since Featherhead refused
to publish my Emmett Till article

367
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:19,193
in <i>The Blue and Gold,</i>

368
00:23:19,277 --> 00:23:21,487
I've been keen to start a literary society

369
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:23,489
for Riverdale's Black students.

370
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:29,745
A club that publishes a journal
focusing on Black voices and writing.

371
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:32,081
I think that's an excellent idea.

372
00:23:32,164 --> 00:23:33,834
Yeah. I've been craving a forum

373
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:37,087
where I can publish my literary criticism,
poetry, and short fiction.

374
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,966
And this is something that you'd do
in addition to cheerleading?

375
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:42,134
No.

376
00:23:42,843 --> 00:23:44,219
I gave that up.

377
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:45,387
What happened?

378
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,349
I joined the Vixens for the wrong reasons.

379
00:23:50,183 --> 00:23:53,271
It was because I had a crush on a girl.

380
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,231
Cheryl Blossom.

381
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:57,817
But now that's over, so...

382
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,321
Anyway, I think publishing this journal

383
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:04,240
could really make a difference
for Black students at Riverdale.

384
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:06,492
It would. Definitely.

385
00:24:06,576 --> 00:24:08,119
But what happened with Cheryl?

386
00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:11,040
On the level, we're just so different.

387
00:24:11,123 --> 00:24:14,710
She's rich, she's white, she's a Blossom.

388
00:24:15,336 --> 00:24:17,630
The whole thing,
it would just be impossible.

389
00:24:17,713 --> 00:24:19,214
I mean, it's hard.

390
00:24:19,298 --> 00:24:21,133
But it's not impossible.

391
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:25,471
For Kevin and I,
we're also very different, so...

392
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:28,058
everything's a conversation.

393
00:24:28,141 --> 00:24:31,019
But he's up for getting to know me
and what I'm all about.

394
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,062
And vice versa.

395
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:34,064
I hear that, Clay.

396
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:35,982
But you're also both preppies,

397
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:38,943
so at least you're starting off
on the same foot.

398
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:40,028
Fair enough.

399
00:24:41,154 --> 00:24:43,865
I guess it all depends
on how much you like the person.

400
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,916
Kevin, you haven't seen Clay, have you?

401
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:55,044
He's running late.
Had some stuff at school.

402
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,587
Can we chat about something?

403
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:58,214
Of course.

404
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:02,510
It's just, it seems like you're coming on
really strong with Clay.

405
00:25:03,386 --> 00:25:04,637
I might be.

406
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,266
Clay would never say anything,
but is that really appropriate?

407
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,976
Oh, Kevin.

408
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:12,646
Don't be such a wet rag.

409
00:25:14,231 --> 00:25:17,067
What's wrong
with a little workplace flirtation?

410
00:25:18,276 --> 00:25:20,654
It's not like Clay
is even remotely interested.

411
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:22,698
He's not. I know that for a fact.

412
00:25:23,366 --> 00:25:24,283
Oh.

413
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:25,326
And why is that?

414
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,370
Because he's not attracted to...

415
00:25:27,453 --> 00:25:29,038
assertive women?

416
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:30,081
No.

417
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:32,125
He's not attracted to any women.

418
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:34,877
Neither am I, for that matter.

419
00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:36,629
I knew it.

420
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:40,091
I knew you were both
secret friends of Dorothy.

421
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:43,137
You knew? How?

422
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,973
You're both dreamy flutter bums

423
00:25:46,056 --> 00:25:47,516
who can quote every line

424
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:50,394
of Norma Desmond's dialogue
in <i>Sunset Blvd.</i>

425
00:25:50,477 --> 00:25:53,397
If you knew,
why would you make a play for Clay?

426
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,858
To test my hypothesis, of course.

427
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:59,528
You lucky dog. He is a hunk.

428
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:05,410
Say, what are the chances
Clay swings both ways?

429
00:26:05,493 --> 00:26:07,829
Uh, he doesn't. We don't.

430
00:26:07,912 --> 00:26:09,664
Double-checking, that's all.

431
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:12,083
You're okay with this?

432
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,418
Absolutely.

433
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:16,588
Kevin, the only thing
better than having a hunky boyfriend,

434
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:19,133
is having hunky friends who are boys.

435
00:26:19,675 --> 00:26:20,676
The thing is...

436
00:26:21,302 --> 00:26:25,139
I've always had more fun going out
with Toni and Tab, than, say...

437
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:27,057
Steve and Dennis.

438
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,687
Steve McQueen and Dennis Hopper.

439
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:34,106
Don't worry. We'll get you up to snuff.

440
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:37,611
Oh, Kevin.

441
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:39,696
I'm so excited.

442
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:43,909
This hick town
is finally starting to feel like home.

443
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:46,119
[Veronica chuckles]

444
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,332
[Frank] <i>All right, fellas. Huddle up.
Julian has an announcement.</i>

445
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:52,918
Tomorrow night,

446
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:57,006
my parents are hosting their annual
Bulldog Booster Basketball Mixer.

447
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:00,760
This year, it's also a fundraiser
to build us a new gym.

448
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:03,638
- Are the cheerleaders invited?
- Absolutely.

449
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:05,515
So dress spiffy.

450
00:27:05,598 --> 00:27:06,974
Okay? Coats and ties.

451
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,309
Make sure you shower.

452
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,103
[Frank clears throat]

453
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:17,277
And, of course, we'll be welcoming
our newest Bulldog to the family.

454
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:18,654
I suppose.

455
00:27:26,954 --> 00:27:30,207
You know, that Blossom mixer
may sound a little stuffy, but...

456
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,044
they're always a gas and a half.

457
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:34,963
Yeah, well, let me know how that goes.

458
00:27:37,382 --> 00:27:39,843
- You're not going?
- No, I can't be distracted.

459
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:42,762
The NCAA is giving out scholarships
for college,

460
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:45,974
and if I get one of those,
I'm made in the shade.

461
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:51,564
Reggie, no man is an island.

462
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:54,149
Can't you do all that
and still cut loose a little?

463
00:27:55,317 --> 00:27:58,153
Hell, Julian made it seem
like you're the guest of honor.

464
00:27:58,237 --> 00:27:59,488
If that's what you heard...

465
00:28:00,155 --> 00:28:02,199
you're a lot more naive than I thought.

466
00:28:03,993 --> 00:28:05,744
Why are you being such a killjoy, Mantle?

467
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:08,706
Why can't you meet anyone halfway?

468
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:10,000
Meet halfway?

469
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:14,796
Julian and those guys haven't taken
one step towards me since I got here.

470
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,592
And you haven't heard anything
I've been saying.

471
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:22,137
Sophomore year,
I was recruited by Stonewall Prep.

472
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:24,556
And I was juiced to be there.

473
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:26,766
But I never belonged there.

474
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,186
<i>And my teammates made that very clear.</i>

475
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:32,356
[Bret] Oh!

476
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,609
You guys like rice, don't you?

477
00:28:34,692 --> 00:28:37,028
Is that enough to take back
to your farm, yellow-belly?

478
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:38,279
[Bret laughing]

479
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:41,574
[Reggie] <i>And that was day one.</i>

480
00:28:41,657 --> 00:28:45,328
During practice, the other players
would foul me on purpose.

481
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:48,540
And they did whatever they could
to run me out of there, and guess what?

482
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:50,375
It worked.

483
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:53,712
So this time,
I'm not meeting anyone halfway.

484
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:57,174
Not giving anyone an opening...

485
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:02,095
a chance to humiliate me,

486
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:03,222
ever again.

487
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:05,642
All right?

488
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:07,143
All right.

489
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:11,564
Reggie.

490
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:15,610
I'm sorry that happened to you.

491
00:29:18,363 --> 00:29:20,114
But we're not like that here.

492
00:29:21,157 --> 00:29:22,283
Aren't you?

493
00:29:32,962 --> 00:29:34,171
Cheryl.

494
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:36,840
Toni.

495
00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:38,968
Hello.

496
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:40,678
How are you?

497
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:43,723
I'm...

498
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:46,977
being stoic and strong
for the sake of my Vixens.

499
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,353
How are you?

500
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:50,689
Well, I'm petitioning for a new club.

501
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:53,191
And you, as junior class president,

502
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:56,403
are in charge
of the student council's financing.

503
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:59,030
I was hoping you could help us
secure some funding.

504
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:00,825
What kind of club is it?

505
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:04,120
It's a literary society
for Riverdale's Black students.

506
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:06,706
To share their ideas,
stories, and writings

507
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:09,000
with each other and the student body.

508
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:12,962
A way to express ourselves
on our own terms.

509
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,631
That's a really wonderful idea.

510
00:30:15,715 --> 00:30:18,302
I'll put the request through today, but...

511
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:21,179
Toni, everything has to go
through Featherhead, so...

512
00:30:21,263 --> 00:30:22,222
I know.

513
00:30:22,848 --> 00:30:25,684
And I appreciate you trying.

514
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:28,854
And if Featherhead doesn't approve,
we'll make it work.

515
00:30:28,937 --> 00:30:30,188
We always do.

516
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:32,566
Maybe a bake sale or something.

517
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:36,278
Well, I would contribute
my legendary cherry scones.

518
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,078
Toni, can I ask you a question?

519
00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:50,501
Is part of the reason you broke up with me
because I'm white?

520
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,505
There was a lot of reasons, Cheryl.

521
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:57,301
All interconnected, but...

522
00:30:58,802 --> 00:31:01,263
that was part of it, yeah.

523
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:07,561
I will try my absolute best
with Featherhead.

524
00:31:07,644 --> 00:31:08,979
I promise.

525
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:19,074
[jazz music playing over speakers]

526
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:20,325
[chattering]

527
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:45,601
Fancy meeting you here.

528
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:46,894
Howdy-doody, Betty.

529
00:31:48,062 --> 00:31:49,730
How's it going being a paper-shaker?

530
00:31:49,814 --> 00:31:51,566
Oh, swell.

531
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:55,445
Werthers thought it would help me
burn off some excess energy.

532
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:57,030
Grownups don't have a clue.

533
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:58,949
No, they don't.

534
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:02,035
Anyways, I don't think I'll be a Vixen
for much longer.

535
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:02,994
Why's that?

536
00:32:03,078 --> 00:32:04,538
Once my mother finds out

537
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:07,833
that I've been assigned
a basketball player to take care of,

538
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:09,961
she will... flip her lid.

539
00:32:16,092 --> 00:32:17,135
[Archie] Oh, crap.

540
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,848
Um, will you excuse me, Betty? I, um...

541
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:24,308
- I'll take it.
- Thanks.

542
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:30,023
Archie.

543
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:33,485
Your uncle's telling me
that you're sharing a room with our, uh...

544
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:35,362
Our secret weapon.

545
00:32:36,113 --> 00:32:37,322
Uh, you mean Reggie?

546
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:38,782
Yes. I am.

547
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:42,077
Well, as a former Bulldog myself...

548
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:45,581
I do appreciate the sacrifice.

549
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:48,835
It's no trouble at all.
I'm cranked to do it, really.

550
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:50,712
Well, I know I couldn't.

551
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:53,214
I mean, bunking with a...

552
00:32:53,298 --> 00:32:55,925
We look upon him
as a necessary evil, Dennis.

553
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:56,885
A means to an end.

554
00:32:56,968 --> 00:32:58,636
She's talking about winning.

555
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,055
Bulldogs must be champions this year.

556
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:02,891
Town needs something to rally behind.

557
00:33:03,683 --> 00:33:04,643
And, you know, Frank,

558
00:33:04,727 --> 00:33:07,897
when you suggested
bringing on a Korean prodigy...

559
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,106
[chuckles]

560
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,774
Well, I was skeptical.

561
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:13,068
But having seen him play... Whew.

562
00:33:13,152 --> 00:33:15,863
I now see how inspired your thinking was.

563
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:18,073
Tell me something, Archie.

564
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:20,326
Does he, uh...

565
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:24,623
actually realize the opportunity
we're presenting to him and his family?

566
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:26,082
He does.

567
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:30,253
He just doesn't wanna fall behind
on his schoolwork.

568
00:33:30,337 --> 00:33:31,505
Good for him.

569
00:33:33,507 --> 00:33:34,549
But, uh...

570
00:33:35,258 --> 00:33:37,219
Well, we don't care about that.

571
00:33:37,302 --> 00:33:42,391
We just need him to be a loyal soldier
and bring us our championship trophy.

572
00:33:42,475 --> 00:33:45,895
He does that,
preferably with a smile on his face...

573
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:48,439
there'll be no problems for us.

574
00:33:49,524 --> 00:33:51,150
And none for his family.

575
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:54,362
[Archie] If you'll excuse me...

576
00:33:55,238 --> 00:33:57,240
- I'm gonna get some fresh air.
- Yeah.

577
00:33:57,323 --> 00:33:58,324
Good stuff.

578
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:04,122
Well, coach, here's to a winning season.

579
00:34:12,256 --> 00:34:13,632
[Veronica] Reggie Mantle.

580
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:16,927
And here I thought
you weren't a fan of movies.

581
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,471
I didn't say that.

582
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:22,141
I said we didn't have any theaters
in Duck Creek.

583
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:23,601
I stand corrected.

584
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:26,104
And the fact that
I might've been here tonight

585
00:34:26,187 --> 00:34:28,982
didn't influence your decision, I suppose?

586
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:30,567
If I'm being honest?

587
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,236
Oh, I insist upon honesty at all times.

588
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,862
Not at all.

589
00:34:34,946 --> 00:34:37,283
Truth is,
I forgot that you worked at this place.

590
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,453
I don't work at it.

591
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,247
I own it.

592
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,127
Now, what can I get for you?
[clears throat]

593
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,712
A small popcorn.

594
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:50,879
No butter.

595
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,047
I'm training.

596
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,847
Here you go.

597
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:00,765
On the house.

598
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:02,934
Thanks.

599
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,273
How rude can you get?

600
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,151
Anyway, there's plenty of other fish
in the sea.

601
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,360
True.

602
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:17,950
But take a powder, Herman Melville,
because that is the real Moby Dick.

603
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,704
[Tabitha]
Wow. This is like the Orient Express.

604
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,539
[Jughead] That's exactly what I said.

605
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,458
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

606
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,375
Yeah.

607
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,878
Um, I actually... I brought you something.

608
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:33,884
Here. This is for you to keep.

609
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:39,890
<i>"Darkwater: Voices from Within the Veil</i>
by W.E.B. Du Bois"?

610
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,308
- "Du Bois."
- Du Bois.

611
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:44,895
He is a sociologist
and a civil rights activist.

612
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:46,730
He's also one of my favorite authors.

613
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,899
Wow, it's a great title.

614
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:50,401
Which one should I start with?

615
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:53,821
Well, we've established
that you're a fan of science fiction.

616
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:57,533
- Mm-hm.
- And though it's more speculative fiction,

617
00:35:57,617 --> 00:36:00,912
I would suggest a story that Du Bois wrote
called "The Comet."

618
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:03,915
- What's that one about?
- Oh. It's fantastic.

619
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:07,168
It's about this comet
that hits New York City,

620
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:10,381
then it kills everybody
except for two people:

621
00:36:10,464 --> 00:36:12,966
A man named Jim and a woman named Julia.

622
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,595
And it's sort of
about this unlikely relationship

623
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,639
that develops between them.

624
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:24,603
And what's really interesting
is that Jim is Black and Julia's white.

625
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:27,148
And it's sort of one of the first times

626
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:31,027
an interracial relationship
has been depicted in science fiction.

627
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,196
Well, it sounds terrific.

628
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:35,115
- Yeah.
- I can't wait to read it.

629
00:36:35,198 --> 00:36:39,119
Actually, I was thinking
that maybe we could read it together...

630
00:36:39,202 --> 00:36:40,537
tonight, aloud, if...

631
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,080
If you wanted.

632
00:36:42,789 --> 00:36:44,374
Yeah, that sounds swell.

633
00:36:47,586 --> 00:36:48,963
How was the mixer?

634
00:36:51,632 --> 00:36:54,218
It was Dullsville, honestly.
You didn't miss out on much.

635
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:57,805
Hmm. How were the cheerleaders?
All dolled-up?

636
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:03,060
I don't really wanna talk about it.

637
00:37:04,229 --> 00:37:05,981
Hey, I'm gonna grab a shower.

638
00:37:16,742 --> 00:37:19,161
Okay, you lug nuts.

639
00:37:20,162 --> 00:37:22,165
Coach is in a meeting.

640
00:37:22,248 --> 00:37:24,000
So I'm running warmups today.

641
00:37:24,584 --> 00:37:26,169
Everyone good with that?

642
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:30,006
In that case, let's play ball.

643
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:31,382
[rock music playing]

644
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,092
[boy 1] Here we go.

645
00:37:39,932 --> 00:37:40,768
[boy 2] Nice.

646
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,613
Come on. Banana boy, pass me the ball.

647
00:37:52,696 --> 00:37:54,406
Pass me the ball!

648
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:00,914
[boys] Oh! Whoa!

649
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,666
[boy 3] Hey, come on.

650
00:38:06,503 --> 00:38:07,504
Listen up.

651
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:10,924
We are not doing this crap.

652
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,554
If you haven't noticed,
Reggie here is our strongest player.

653
00:38:17,055 --> 00:38:19,683
Our only shot
at making the playoffs this year.

654
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:21,769
So we're gonna rise to his level.

655
00:38:21,852 --> 00:38:23,896
So if you don't wanna be chummy with him,

656
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:25,689
that's fine.

657
00:38:26,232 --> 00:38:29,026
But the minute we hit this court,
we are teammates.

658
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:30,236
Fighting for each other.

659
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:33,948
If you can't get on board with that,
the door's right there.

660
00:38:36,284 --> 00:38:38,495
That includes you too, captain.

661
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:45,252
[Cheryl] <i>I hope this will suffice.</i>

662
00:38:45,836 --> 00:38:47,295
Funds for your new club.

663
00:38:47,379 --> 00:38:49,172
Thank you, Cheryl.

664
00:38:49,256 --> 00:38:51,967
I'm shocked Featherhead approved
a Black literary society.

665
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:54,177
He didn't.

666
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:55,888
Those funds were earmarked for...

667
00:38:56,597 --> 00:38:57,682
something else.

668
00:38:57,765 --> 00:39:01,644
But I believe your club
to be a much more worthy endeavor.

669
00:39:01,727 --> 00:39:04,188
Well, I won't ask any more questions.

670
00:39:04,939 --> 00:39:06,023
But thank you.

671
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:08,192
Of course.

672
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:12,405
I look forward
to reading your first issue.

673
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:16,118
Cheryl, wait.

674
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:20,831
Yes?

675
00:39:21,331 --> 00:39:23,750
What are you doing
after cheerleading practice?

676
00:39:25,419 --> 00:39:26,503
No plans.

677
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:28,255
Why?

678
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:30,299
If you want...

679
00:39:30,883 --> 00:39:33,761
maybe we could meet at the Dark Room.

680
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:37,265
I would love that.

681
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:40,226
Do you mean to talk?

682
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,144
Yeah.

683
00:39:41,895 --> 00:39:45,356
About what it would mean...

684
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,609
if we tried again.

685
00:39:55,868 --> 00:39:57,786
I didn't sock Julian for you.

686
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,125
I know you don't need saving.

687
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,669
I did it for my own sake
and for the team's.

688
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,592
I didn't wanna believe
you were right about this town.

689
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:15,347
But, hell, maybe we are just as...

690
00:40:15,972 --> 00:40:18,224
As messed up as any other place.

691
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:20,685
I don't know.

692
00:40:32,949 --> 00:40:35,826
You wanna grab a burger at Pop's
on the way home?

693
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:38,412
Maybe we'll run into
some of the other fellas there?

694
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,582
Sure. If you're sure.

695
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:42,708
I am.

696
00:40:43,668 --> 00:40:46,213
Just don't expect me
to sit with anyone or anything.

697
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,348
[Jughead]
<i>Tabitha and I stayed up till dawn</i>

698
00:40:56,431 --> 00:40:58,433
<i>reading and discussing Du Bois' stories.</i>

699
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:02,562
<i>The next day, I wanted to tell
Mr. Rayberry all about my swell night,</i>

700
00:41:02,646 --> 00:41:04,357
<i>so I went back to his apartment.</i>

701
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:10,238
What happened?

702
00:41:11,447 --> 00:41:15,451
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but Brad Rayberry is dead.

703
00:41:16,035 --> 00:41:19,080
What...? How did he die?

704
00:41:19,163 --> 00:41:20,873
He, uh, killed himself.

705
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,127
Hung himself.

706
00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:25,129
He left a note.

707
00:41:25,629 --> 00:41:28,882
"I can no longer
continue living this way."

708
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,971
I'm sorry, Jughead.
I know that he was your friend.
