00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,495
Well,
your friend's keeping mum,

10

11
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,233
that the milkman
killed her parents.

12
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:36,136
Willie?

13

him in for questioning?

It's late and Willie could use
his rest,

17

We'll talk to him tomorrow

his morning deliveries.

00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:18,626
Oh, okay. Well--

176
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,496
However, there is an event
at the Dark Room tonight.

177
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:24,131
Some sort of poetry reading.

178
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:27,868

in fear of being slimed
by a greaser.

179
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:31,540
But with the proper escort,
I might relent.

180
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,374
-Poetry reading?
-Hmm.

181
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,210
Well, I've actually just
started writing poetry myself.

182
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,379
How peachy keen for you.

183
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,713

184
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,497

after Andrews,

189

190
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,576
Word on the street is
he's going to something

191
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,610
at the beatnik bar tonight
with Cheryl.

192
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:16,784
I want to go.
To the Dark Room.

193
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,554
I didn't know you were into
the whole beatnik scene.

194
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:22,323
Oh, I'm into a lot of scenes,
Julian.

195
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,757

[Sheriff Keller]
Sorry to bother you, there,
Willie,

197
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:33,502

every lead,

let's begin
with a very useful diagram.

from the typical
American flower,

whose sole function,
with its colorful petals

330

is pollination
or reproduction.

Gosh, a real-life
make-out party.

351
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:24,645
I'll have to check my book
to see what Dr. Kingsley
says about them.

352
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:28,082
[Veronica]
Between you and me,
it all boils down to this.

353
00:22:28,115 --> 00:22:29,650
Boys think they're in charge,

354
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:33,087
but it's all about
our pleasure, not theirs.

355
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,925
Well, right now, I don't think
either me or Kevin are
experiencing much pleasure.

356
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:40,862
Hmm.

357
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:43,731
The more direct you can be
with your beau, the better.

358
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:45,700
I botched it playing coy
with Archie.

359
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:49,770
But I'll make my desires
crystal clear to him
at the party.

360
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,507
[scoffs]

361
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,714
[both chuckle]

362
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:02,583
[indistinct chatter]

363
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:11,759
[Toni] Hey, Blossom.

364
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:15,196
You didn't stick around after
my performance last night.

365
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:16,731
Did you dig it?

366
00:23:16,764 --> 00:23:21,202
It was a little... avant-garde
for my sensibilities.

367
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:22,703
Archie thought the same.

368
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:24,739
You have heard
we're going steady,
have you not?

369
00:23:24,772 --> 00:23:26,473
Yeah. We've all seen you
parade him around

370
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:28,576
like he's some kind
of prize stud.

371
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:30,511
You know, you don't have to go
to some make-out party

372
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:32,847
to pretend to be somebody
you're not.

373
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,650
Why exactly does everyone
presume to know
my personal life?

374
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:38,586
You're worse than
my hobgoblin mother,
and that's saying a lot.

375
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:49,496
Kev, can we talk for a sec?

376
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:52,432
It's about the make-out party.

377
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:54,969
Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking,
why don't we ditch that?

378
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:56,871
No. We're going.

379
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:59,507
It's happening tonight,
Kevin, you and me.

380
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,342
Because you say
that you love me

381
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,779
and now it's time
that you proved it.

382
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:13,387
[door closes]

383
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:15,656
We'll cut right
to the chase, Jughead.

384
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,491
Did you break into
Ethel Muggs' house yesterday?

385
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:21,162
Uh, I'm pretty sure
that I was just at home

386
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:22,697
writing and eating hamburgers.

387
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,432
Because there's
a neighbor there

388
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,834
that reported someone
matching your description.

389
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:30,371
Teenager wearing a crown
exiting a window.

390
00:24:30,404 --> 00:24:31,572
Well, that wasn't me.

391
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:33,607
-Hmm.
-You are a...

392
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,577
Well, you're a bit
of an odd duck,

393
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,779
aren't you, Mr. Jones?

394
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,548
A loner.

395
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:42,750
Like Miss Muggs.

396
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:45,286
Is she your girlfriend?

397
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,554
She's just a friend.

398
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:48,456
Are you protecting her now?

399
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,958
Maybe you helped her
do something bad and...

400
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:52,860
now you have to protect
yourself, too.

401
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:57,198
I wasn't at
Ethel Muggs' house
last night,

402
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,498
and I'm not her boyfriend

403
00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:01,335
or an odd duck loner,
whatever that means.

404
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:04,505
In fact,
I'm going to a party tonight.

405
00:25:04,538 --> 00:25:06,874
-With all the cool kids.
-[Dr. Werthers scoffs]

406
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:08,909
-Really?
-And... And for the record,

407
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:12,747
the Ethel that I know
would not kill her parents.

408
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,215
You're barking up
the wrong tree.

409
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:15,149
Now can I go, please?

410
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,385
Yeah.

411
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:18,719
You're free to go.

412
00:25:19,754 --> 00:25:22,890
Oh, enjoy your party tonight.

413
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:33,501
Oh, uh, hey, Clay. Um...

414
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:35,102
Thought I missed
the locker-room rush.

415
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,271
What can I say?

416
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:39,106
I love a long,
lingering shower.

417
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,031
[sputters] Um... Are you going
to that make-out party?

418
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:06,734
I don't think so.

419
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:09,003
Why not?

420
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:12,807
Because...

421
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:15,843
I like boys, Kevin.

422
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:20,147
And I don't think
it's that kind of party.

423
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:26,954
Uh, that...
That makes sense.

424
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:30,458
Obviously, most people
don't know that about me.

425
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:32,059
I hope I can trust you
to be discreet.

426
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,062
Of course, Clay.

427
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,699
Uh, I gotta go. Um...

428
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:41,068
-Gotta get ready.
-All right.

429
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:49,743
-[Archie] Hey, Betty.
-[Betty] Hmm?

430
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:52,079
You know that, um...

431
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:55,116
sex book you mentioned?

432
00:26:57,151 --> 00:27:00,287
I was wondering
if I could have a little read.

433
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:02,123
Um... [chuckles]

434
00:27:02,156 --> 00:27:06,193
Just so I can brush up
before the make-out party.

435
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:08,129
Of course.

436
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:17,004
What do you think
of Dr. Kingsley?

437
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:19,073
I mean, I think...
I think I get it.

438
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:20,107
I just...

439
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,612
But how does it all start?

440
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:25,779
That's the easy part.

441
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:29,551
Okay, so say you're sitting
side-by-side

442
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:31,819
next to Cheryl like this.

443
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:36,056
Maybe some music
starts playing.

444
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:43,632
[romantic music playing]

445
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:48,068
Now you might want to say
something like...

446
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:51,071
"Cheryl, would you like
to get a bit more comfortable?"

447
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,811
[clears throat]

448
00:27:57,845 --> 00:28:01,148
Say, would you like to get
a bit more comfortable?

449
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:03,951
Why, yes, I would.

450
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:13,928
Then...

451
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:15,362
she might...

452
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:18,232
do this.

453
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,167
Oh.

454
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,269
And then what?

455
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,004
And then...

456
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:29,009
Oh!

457
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:32,146
-I'm sorry, Betty.
-What? No. It's okay.

458
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:33,314
I'm sorry.

459
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:41,822
[indistinct conversation]

460
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:48,563
[rock 'n' roll instrumental
music playing]

461
00:28:48,597 --> 00:28:50,097
Now, before we break off

462
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,834
and retreat into
the Pembrooke's
various dark corners,

463
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:55,869
I thought we could warm up

464
00:28:55,903 --> 00:29:00,074
with a perfectly innocent
round of Post Office.

465
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:02,943
Now, boys, each of you
is holding an envelope

466
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:06,715
containing a number which
corresponds to one of us girls.

467
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:09,450
You must deliver
your envelope to that girl

468
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:12,019
along with a kiss.

469
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:14,154
Fangs, would you like
to get us started?

470
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:17,057
-[clears throat]
-Reveal your number
and the girl you'll be kissing.

471
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,994
[exhales] Okay.

472
00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:25,466
Number two.

473
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:27,736
[groans] That's me.

474
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:29,671
I bet you've never kissed
a greaser before.

475
00:29:29,704 --> 00:29:31,506
I don't even eat French fries.

476
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,742
But rules are rules.

477
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:35,175
Forgive me, Midge.

478
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:37,646
Don't worry, square.

479
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,114
I brushed my teeth
earlier this week.

480
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:43,618
-Ugh!
-Oh!

481
00:29:43,652 --> 00:29:44,918
Whoa! Was that cheating?

482
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,288
It's skirting the edge,

483
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:50,625
but hopefully Kevin will
give us what we all want.

484
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:53,193
Which is a real kiss.

485
00:29:53,595 --> 00:29:54,895
Kevin?

486
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:58,767
Uh, number three.

487
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,100
I'm three.

488
00:30:10,745 --> 00:30:12,379
Hold your head still.

489
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:16,884
All right, let's just get this
over with.

490
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:19,887
[sighs]

491
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:23,457
One.

492
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,528
That's me.

493
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:27,895
This oughta be good.

494
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:31,065
Nice to meet you, by the way.

495
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:33,367
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

496
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:43,344
Thank you.

497
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:51,653
Five.

498
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:53,987
Wow. [chuckles]
That's me.

499
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:55,623
How did that happen?

500
00:30:55,657 --> 00:30:56,957
Excuse me, brother.

501
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:02,963
I guess this is what's known
as a date with destiny.

502
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,410
She's gonna suffocate him.

503
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,513
But what a way to go.

504
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:24,451
I think I got your gum.

505
00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:25,452
You can keep it.

506
00:31:25,486 --> 00:31:26,453
It's Triple Bubble.

507
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:34,928
Guess that leaves me
and the Wild One.

508
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:37,064
Luckily, I've had all my shots.

509
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:44,471
Yeah. That's not a kiss,
preppie.

510
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:45,472
This is a kiss.

511
00:31:57,418 --> 00:31:58,520
Okay.

512
00:31:58,553 --> 00:32:01,623
Now that all of our lips
are appropriately lubricated,

513
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:02,824
we pair off.

514
00:32:02,857 --> 00:32:04,592
I, for instance,
might sneak off with--

515
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:05,993
Come along, Archie.

516
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:09,597
Let's find a private space
away from prying eyes.

517
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:17,070
What do you say?

518
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:18,573
Shall we go to your room?

519
00:32:20,575 --> 00:32:21,609
Actually...

520
00:32:22,777 --> 00:32:24,144
You.

521
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:25,880
[Jughead] Me?

522
00:32:25,914 --> 00:32:28,917
You just hit the jackpot,
Holden Caulfield.

523
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:31,351
I guess
that leaves the two of you.

524
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:36,624
We could finish
what you started.

525
00:32:36,658 --> 00:32:38,793
In your dreams, prepster.

526
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:40,929
I will, however,
