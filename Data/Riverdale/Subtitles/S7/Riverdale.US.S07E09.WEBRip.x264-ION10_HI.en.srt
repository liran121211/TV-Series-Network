[audience] Yeah!

173
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:52,257
[boy] Yeah!

174
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,015
Due to some unforeseen
technical difficulties,

175
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:58,357
I regret to inform you
we are unable to screen

176
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:01,158
our James Dean double feature tonight.

177
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:02,203
I knew it.

179
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:04,709
[Veronica] However...

180
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:10,768
However, we are working on the problem
and are rescheduling said double feature.

181
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:12,230
That's all very well and good,

182
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:15,658
but we, the proud members
of the James Dean Fan Club,

183
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,704
Riverdale Chapter, demand a refund.

184
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:19,167
Immediately.

185
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,880
[all chanting] <i>Refund! Refund! Refund!</i>

186
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:22,218
Refund?

187
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:25,309
You all got free passes.
Including you, Cheryl.

188
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,485
True, but we did spend
all this money on popcorn and soda

189
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:31,744
to consume during the double feature,
which is no longer happening.

190

[audience clamoring]

191
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:38,389
I would be more than happy to provide
each and every one of you

00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:41,857
with a voucher
for any snack of your choosing.

193
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,743
We don't want your stupid vouchers,
we want our money back.

- What a fake-out!

195

All right. All right.
All right. Calm down.

197

Calm down. You can present your receipts
at the concession stands

198

199
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:01,497
Yeah, right!

200
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,920
Hey!

202
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:13,865
I'm so sorry.

203
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:17,333
As much as I'd be delighted
to split a milkshake with you...

204
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,882
- You've got a business to take care of.
- I do.

205
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:23,100
The Babylonium's hanging on
by the most gossamer of threads.

206
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:25,774
I figured as much.

207
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,743
I'd happily take a rain check.

208
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,168
Yeah? Sure.

209
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:36,680
Yeah, just let me know
when's a good time for you.

210
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:38,978
Okay.

211
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,837
I've never heard
of such a thing, Mr. Roth.

212
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:50,177
A venerated studio like yours

213
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,314
sending out unplayable prints
of a major release like <i>East of Eden?</i>

214
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:56,487
[Roth] <i>I'm as baffled as you, Miss Lodge.</i>

215
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,916
At any rate, please accept
our deepest apologies for this mishap.

216
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,712
I'll accept your apology,

217
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:06,098
but what I really want
is a pristine copy of <i>East of Eden.</i>

218
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:09,649
And what I want is audiences
in Riverdale to see this picture.

219
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:11,488
<i>I do. It's a wonderful picture.</i>

220
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:14,580
But I'm afraid
that there are no more available prints.

221
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:17,254
You sent me a defective product.
How is this my problem?

222
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,383
Miss Lodge...

223
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,931
<i>Veronica. May I call you Veronica?</i>

224
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:22,602
You are the theater owner.

225
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:26,363
It's always your problem.
You'd know that if you weren't so green.

226
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:28,912
"Green"? Let me assure you...

227

<i>I'm so sorry, but I need to let you go.</i>

228

I'm having lunch at the Polo Lounge
with Monty Clift,

229
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:36,225
but good luck to you.

230
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:45,125
How does a major studio run out of prints
of their biggest release of the year?

231
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:46,170
I don't know.

232
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:49,429
But luckily,
they're not the only studio in town.

239
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:09,361
Listen, my customers simply
don't have time for that Steinbeck yawner.

240
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:12,035
I need something exciting,
something fresh.

241
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:15,378
Do you have any available prints
of <i>To Catch a Thief?</i>

242
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:18,052
I'm hearing great things
about Hitchcock's latest.

243
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:21,480
Word around town
is that <i>Oklahoma!</i> is a masterpiece.

244
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:24,989
What about this <i>Night of the Hunter</i>
I keep reading about?

245
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,538
- It's RKO.

<i>Please, don't call us again.</i>

254
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:50,311

into business with their parents.</i>

257

<i>But good luck to you, Miss Lodge.
You'll need it.</i>

258
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:04,226
[sighs] Well, there you have it, boys.

259
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,655
I and the Babylonium have been blacklisted
by every major studio in Hollywood.

260
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,743
Why, though?

261
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,829
[sighs]

262
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:14,380
If I had to hazard a guess, my parents.

263
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:18,559
I've been waiting for this since
I bought the theater out from under them.

264
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:20,815
My last call confirmed it, but honestly,

265
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,701
I suspected sabotage
from the moment we got that bad print.

266
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,247
What do your parents want?

267
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:31,262
To see everyone but themselves fail,
including their own daughter.

268
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,270
I'm sure they want
the Babylonium to shutter

269
00:15:34,354 --> 00:15:37,655
so they can buy it from me at a discount
and turn it into a parking lot.

270
00:15:38,282 --> 00:15:39,243
I have an idea.

271
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:43,213
So far, we've only tried
the major studios.

272
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:46,597
But there are a lot of smaller,
independent places out there.

273
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:49,982
They're scrappy,
and they don't play by the same rules.

274
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:52,614
Their movies don't have big stars
or budgets or prestige.

275
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:57,713
In other words, they're B movies,
but they're still movies.

276
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:00,094
Good idea, Clay.

277

we're going down fighting.

do you ever remember your dreams?

00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,020
Sometimes.

282
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:20,361
Are your dreams sexual?

00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:24,288
Sometimes.

Well, then, tell me, Betty.

The urge to be seen
in such a sexualized way?

315
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:29,563
It must titillate you,
make it more exciting for you.

I don't think it's just about
being seen sexually.

about being seen... period.

00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:54,974
Story was kind of a mess,
but the monster was cool.

336
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:56,017
I loved it.

337
00:19:57,605 --> 00:19:58,985
Mr. Rayberry loved it too.

338
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:01,909
Why do you ask?

339
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:09,097
Because after calling every minor
independent studio in La-La Land,

340
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:11,980
it's the only movie I can get
to play at the Babylonium.

341
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:16,159
Why don't you just do
what William Castle did?

342
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,083
That name dimly rings a bell.

343
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:20,923
He's a producer, director.

344
00:20:21,006 --> 00:20:24,057
His movies are just okay,
but they all came with a kind of gimmick.

345
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,190
Like for <i>The Tingler,</i> filmed in Percepto!,

346
00:20:27,274 --> 00:20:29,238
he put buzzers under the audience seats,

347
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:32,037
and when the monster, The Tingler,
appeared on screen,

348
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:35,088
he would buzz the people
and give them an electric shock.

349
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:36,717
That sounds dangerous.

350
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:39,935
Just a mild shock, but it worked.
People went nuts for <i>The Tingler.</i>

351
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:42,944
I get it.

352
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:46,705
Sell the gimmick, not the movie.

353
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:49,922
I can do that.

357
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:06,093
You remember Reverend Lowe

358
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:09,645
from Riverdale First
Reformed Presbyterian Church.

359
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,238
My, how you've grown
since the children's choir, Elizabeth.

360
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,955
He's going to hear your confession.

361
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:18,922
And perform an exorcism,
if need be, right?

366

Elizabeth, I had to.
They were prescribed to me.

- By Dr. Werthers?
- I would rather not say.

368

You... You broke into my room
and stole my diaries

369
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,127

370
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,383
Good grief, Mother.

371
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:52,559

were talking about me.

Oh. Well, sorry to interrupt,

391
00:23:47,805 --> 00:23:51,190
but have you heard of this book <i>Lolita?</i>

392
00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:53,696
Holy moly.

393
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:55,536
Where did you get this?

394
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:58,293
I borrowed it from a friend.

395
00:23:58,377 --> 00:23:59,965
What can you tell me about it?

396
00:24:00,048 --> 00:24:02,639
Well, it's Nabokov's latest novel.

397
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:07,318
It's pretty salacious
according to <i>The Paris Review.</i>

398
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:11,455
It's about a relationship
between a professor named Humbert Humbert

399
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:14,046
and a young girl named Dolores Haze.

400
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:16,386
- How young?
- Twelve.

401
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:17,389
Twelve?

402
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:19,562
So it's a book for perverts?

403
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:24,201
Well, passing moral judgment
on a work of art is a slippery slope.

404
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:26,665
Have you read it yet?

405

Perhaps, but this is a re-release
in stunning 4D.

You are a kissing cousin
to Humbert Humbert, only creepier.

504
00:30:37,057 --> 00:30:41,235
And it is completely inappropriate for you
to be asking me all of these questions

505
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:46,710
about my sexual fantasies and experiences
behind closed doors,

506
00:30:46,793 --> 00:30:48,590

every word that I say,

with that notebook of yours at night.

509

I think you're the one
who's obsessed with sex, doctor.

511
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:01,376
Dangerously so.

512
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,217
And I don't think
you're reading <i>Lolita</i> for research.

513
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:08,563
I think you're reading it for pleasure
and some sick gratification,

514
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:12,366
and I no longer feel comfortable
being alone in a room with you.

as a personal favor to you,

we can try that date again?

Just got off the phone with Dr. Werthers
and he wants to end his sessions with you.

Great. The feeling's mutual.

554
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:21,736
under no circumstances
is he to give up on you.

Mom, why?

556

Because he's going to fix you.

Whatever is wrong with you,
he is going to help me fix it.

558

There is nothing wrong with me.

I wish you would stop trying
to convince me otherwise.

- Dr. Werthers. I'm calling him back.

No, you're right, I don't.
So please enlighten me.

Tell me why you'd rather foist me off
to some quack psychiatrist

573

than just be honest with me,

out of the sessions,

then maybe you're right,
we should end them.

579
00:34:35,028 --> 00:34:39,415
You once told me
that you were afraid for me,

580
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:41,965
afraid of what the world might do to me.

581
00:34:44,388 --> 00:34:47,689

like you're afraid of me?

of his duties this morning.

673
00:40:43,455 --> 00:40:45,252
I think just the check, Pop.

674
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:51,937
I've been re-reading
all of Mr. Rayberry's work,

675
00:40:52,021 --> 00:40:53,735
and I've noticed some recurring themes.

676
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:56,994
Time passes.

677
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,503
Seasons change.

678
00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:04,097
Life moves on, you know?

679
00:41:06,228 --> 00:41:11,660
I don't know if I'm done mourning,
but I think I'm done wallowing.

680
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,839
Think I'm ready to move on.

681
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:20,102
I think he'd want me to move on.

682
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:21,856
I'm glad to hear it.

683
00:41:29,963 --> 00:41:31,759
[siren wailing nearby]

684
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:34,142
[car door closes]

685
00:41:34,685 --> 00:41:35,813
[door bells jingling]

686
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:40,159
Jughead, we're still working
the Rayberry suicide case.

687
00:41:40,994 --> 00:41:43,276
We need your help if we're gonna solve it.

688
00:41:44,164 --> 00:41:45,939
[Jughead] <i>So much for moving on.</i>
