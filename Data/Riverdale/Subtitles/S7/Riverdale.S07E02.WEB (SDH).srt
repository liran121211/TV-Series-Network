00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,469
What is that supposed to mean?

173
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:56,737
It means we've
been dating for months

174
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:59,907
and we're still not
going steady.

175
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,610
You haven't even
pinned me yet.

176
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,911
How am I supposed to pin you?

177
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,446
I don't even
play a varsity sport--

178
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,415
Doesn't need to be
a varsity pin, Kev.

179
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:09,316
It can be any old pin.

180
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,684
Can be a ring, even.

181
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,853
Gosh, when did you become
such a sex maniac?

182
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,090
For your information,

183
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,192
the fact that I want
my supposed boyfriend

184
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:22,830
to kiss me once every blue moon
does not make me a sex maniac,

185
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,534
and I do not have
cold germs or cooties,

186
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:29,203
and I will definitely
not be cheering you on
at the sock hop.

187
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,005
Betty... Betty.

188
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:51,959
[Mr. Fieldstone]
Well, it's pretentious, clunky,
too much dialogue.

189
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,361
But it'll do.

190
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:55,629
Bernie, get in here.

191
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,632
Wha...

192
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,968
-Yes, Mr. Fieldstone.
-[Mr. Fieldstone]
We got a live one here.

193
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:04,539
Now, see who's available to
draw a seven-page zombie story

194
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:06,273
for immediate publication.

195
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,845
So, I'm hired?

196
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,013
A dollar a page.
Take it or leave it.

197
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:16,817
Yeah, I'll take it.
And, um, I know an artist,
an incredible artist.

198
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:20,754
Young, hungry, cheap,
loves monster movies.

199
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:23,525
A real fiend for gore.

200
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:25,392
Okay.

201
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:27,294
But I want those pages
tomorrow.

202
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:28,262
Yeah, you'll have 'em.

203
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,132
And, um...

204
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:33,200
Thank you for everything,
Mr. Fieldstone.

205
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,339
[piano playing]

206
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:50,885
[piano playing stops]

207
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:53,854
Sorry, um...

208
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:55,156
I... I didn't know
the music room
was reserved.

209
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,358
It's not. I was just
horsing around,

210
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:00,060
but you probably need it
to rehearse, I'm guessing.

211
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:02,163
Uh, my set
for the sock hop, yeah.

212
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:05,833
You're Clay Walker, right?

213
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,802
I am. Just
transferred this year.

214
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,606
And you're Kevin Keller.
Son of the sheriff,

215
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,307
dating the prettiest girl
at Riverdale High.

216
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:15,577
[chuckles softly]

217
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,711
I've done my research.

218
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:20,314
Uh, where did you
transfer from?

219
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:24,218
All over. My dad's in the...
Was in the military.

220
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:27,388
Cool. Cool.

221
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,925
Are you going to the sock hop?

222
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,961
I wouldn't have a date.
I don't know many people.

223
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:40,234
Unless, uh, you could think
of someone I should ask.

224
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,905
A lot of people go stag here.

225
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:49,476
It's nice to meet you.

226
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:07,529
Hey. Uh, so I did
a little brushing up

227
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:12,166
and I'm ready
for that demonstration.

228
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,734
How do you feel
about slow dancing?

229
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:17,539
Nothing better.

230
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:20,174
But upon further reflection,

231
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,612
I have no doubt
a Troy Donahue type
like you

232
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:25,479
can trip the light
fantastic, Archie.

233
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,850
So does that mean...

234
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,119
But, quite candidly,

235
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,188
I'm also entertaining
other offers.

236
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,324
What? Oh...

237
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,393
Wow, okay.

238
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,264
However, being my escort
demands more than mere dancing.

239
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:46,601
It also requires
scintillating conversation.

240
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:49,504
I need to know that you won't
be a bore at the sock hop.

241
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:52,072
So, why don't you
clean yourself up

242
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,875
and come by the Pembrooke
at 6:00-ish tonight?

243
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:58,879
I'll be wanting to discuss
politics, art, current events.

244
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,914
Dazzle me with your wit.

245
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:02,883
Okay?

246
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,519
Dazzle you. Okay.

247
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,054
Well, I should motor.

248
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,222
[Veronica] See you tonight.

249
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:11,158
Archiekins?

250
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,126
[clears throat]

251
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:15,963
I'm rooting for you, stud.

252
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:17,264
[exhales]

253
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,077
So they just do whatever
you say, is that it?

254
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,045
Hmm?

255
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:35,382
Oh, you mean boys? [chuckles]

256
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,353
Boys aren't
too, too complicated.

257
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,425
I wish I had your confidence.

258
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,959
Why don't you?

259
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,362
What do you mean?

260
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:51,398
I mean, I'm only just getting
my sea legs here in Riverdale,

261
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:55,570
but I can already tell
you're a catch, Betty.

262
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:57,338
A total Marilyn.

263
00:13:57,371 --> 00:14:00,474
You and Kevin the Crooner
are going steady, aren't you?

264
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,977
Um, not officially.

265
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,013
We may even be on the rocks.

266
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:07,549
That's a shame...

267
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,084
for him.

268
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:13,020
Why don't you invite
some other boy to the sock hop?

269
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,122
Get Kevin all hot and bothered.

270
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:18,158
That's always fun, keeping
our beaus on their toes.

271
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,528
Surely there's some He-Man
at Riverdale High

272
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:21,529
you'd like to make time with.

273
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,735
Tickets. Get your
tickets to the sock hop.

274
00:14:26,768 --> 00:14:28,369
Buy one, get one free.

275
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:31,506
You... Dilton Doiley.

276
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,708
-Why haven't you bought
a ticket to my sock hop yet?
-Uh...

277
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:37,211
For that matter,
why are some people
trying to return their tickets?

278
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:41,148
Um... It might be because
of the Serpents.

279
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,618
What about the Serpents?

280
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:46,554
What are they planning?

281
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:49,323
They said they were going to be
waiting in the parking lot,

282
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,526
and they're gonna throw
rotten eggs at anyone

283
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,327
who tries going to the dance.

284
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,028
Barbarians.

285
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:58,132
And who, pray tell,
is the one
making these threats.

286
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:02,504
Mostly that scary Toni girl.

287
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:04,938
Of course. It would be her.

288
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,144
Well, this means war.

289
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,081
Dismissed.

290
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,021
[Archie] Mom?

291
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,190
[chuckles]

292
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:25,926
Can you help?

293
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,395
[sighs] Hang on.

294
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,230
I might have something
that'll do the trick.

295
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,066
[Mary chuckles]

296
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,171
Oh, that's more like it.

297
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:38,840
I think I'll have to
let it out a little bit,

298
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:41,776
but other than that,
it fits perfectly.

299
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,712
It's a little old-fashioned,
isn't it?

300
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,714
Well, it was your dad's,

301
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:50,350
but he'd want you to wear it,
especially to your first dance.

302
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:53,487
[chuckles] Well, actually,
I need it tonight, Mom.

303
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:57,157
Yeah. Veronica asked me over.

304
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:59,059
You're taking her to the dance?

305
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,261
If I'm lucky.

306
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,833
She wants to give me
a test run, you could say?

307
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:07,100
I don't like the sound of that.

308
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,469
A bit haughty, isn't it?

309
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:10,805
It's not like that.

310
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,439
Veronica is from Los Angeles

311
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,943
and she's practically
a movie star.

312
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,477
Standards
are different out there.

313
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:22,449
-Aw, geez, Mom. [chuckles]
-[Mary] I'm fine.

314
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:26,053
It's just, seeing you
here in his suit,

315
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,222
it just brings back
so many memories.

316
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:30,692
[sighs]

317
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:32,660
You know, your father and I
went to the sock hop together.

318
00:16:32,694 --> 00:16:34,461
He was such a romantic

319
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:36,330
and he wrote me
the sweetest poems.

320
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,565
I still have them somewhere.

321
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,100
Poems?

322
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,302
He knew how
to make a girl swoon.

323
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:45,673
This one, I think.

324
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:46,641
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

325
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:54,248
[Archie] So, Veronica
invited me over to her
place tonight, and...

326
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:56,885
I need to impress her.

327
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:58,051
So don't laugh...

328
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:00,420
but I wrote her a poem.

329
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:04,057
I just need someone
to read it and just

330
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,492
tell me if it's crazy
to give to her.

331
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:10,565
Okay. Hand it over,
Walt Whitman.

332
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:25,513
Well, is it terrible?

333
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,317
No.

334
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:33,621
It's actually really sweet.

335
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,359
You have a poet's soul, Arch.

336
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,327
Who knew?

337
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,099
[jazz music playing]

338
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:04,686
[Cheryl] So this is where
the Serpents dwell.

339
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,120
I always imagined
it'd be something

340
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:09,156
more like a biker bar,
but this...

341
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,792
-This is--
-The Dark Room is

342
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:14,796
a coffeehouse for bikers,
beatniks and badasses.

343
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,932
Which begs the question,
what are you
doing here, preppy?

344
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,333
Better question.

345
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,902
Why are you so hell-bent
on ruining my sock hop

346
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:23,071
the same way
your slimy Serpent pal

347
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,606
tried to ruin
my virtuous Vixen?

348
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,710
Okay, Cheryl. You want people
at your dance, I dig it.

349
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:30,110
So I'll pitch it again.

350
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,647
Let my boy Fangs
blow the roof off the gym

351
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,616
and we'll pack the place.

352
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:38,185
For the bazillionth time,
I have already booked
Kevin and the Crooners.

353
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,487
Yeah, the Crooners
are doneskis.

354
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,222
Look, Fangs is about to play.

355
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,959
So why don't you order
yourself a cappuccino,

356
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:47,028
take a load off
and hear him play?

357
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:48,362
Maybe you'll change your mind

358
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:51,431
and you and I can
get better acquainted.

359
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:54,468
[elevator dings]

360
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:03,645
[knocks on door]

361
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:12,120
-Archie, you made it.
-Am I late?

362
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,788
Oh, not at all, lover boy.

363
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:15,790
We were just discussing
President Eisenhower's decision

364
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:17,290
to run for a second term.

365
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,160
And let me warn you,
the others are very divided.

366
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,495
[chuckles]

367
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,531
-I'm sorry. Others?
-Come. Come on in.

368
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:25,566
We're having aperitifs
in the parlor.

369
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,568
[boys chattering]

370
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:44,652
[Betty] Mom,
can I ask your advice
about something?

371
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:47,755
Well, of course, honey.
What is it?

372
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:50,892
I think I'm having
weird feelings about Archie.

373
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:56,731
Oh. What sort of feelings?

374
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:59,499
Like, stirrings?

375
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:07,474
When we were dancing,
I felt a flutter in my stomach.

376
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:13,715
Is it possible that
this fluttering is

377
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:16,818
a reaction to feeling
underappreciated by Kevin?

378
00:20:18,553 --> 00:20:20,788
I hadn't thought
of it that way.

379
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:22,957
Which is why it's a good thing
that you came to me.

380
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,101
Holy hell, Ethel.

381
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:34,535
There is no way
that Mr. Fieldstone

382
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:36,971
doesn't hire you
after he sees these.

383
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,740
-You really think so?
-Yeah.

384
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:40,174
Even though I'm a girl?

385
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,676
[chuckles] If he doesn't,
I'll eat my own crown.

386
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:48,182
So, uh, Jughead,
the sock hop's tomorrow night.

387
00:20:48,216 --> 00:20:49,217
It is?

388
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,085
What if we went together?

389
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,653
Like, for kicks?

390
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,356
Yeah, yeah, just for kicks.

391
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:58,926
Might be fun.

392
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,728
Could have a decent
spread, cookies and whatnot.

393
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:01,629
[knock at door]

394
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:08,503
Since when are boys
allowed in your room?

395
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:10,138
We're just studying, Mom.

396
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:11,639
Well, whatever you were doing,
you're lucky your father's

397
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,508
working nights
at the factory this week.

398
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,978
I was actually just leaving.

399
00:21:17,011 --> 00:21:17,945
I'll see you
at school tomorrow.

400
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:19,881
Excuse me. Sorry.

401
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:36,329
So then I said,
"Sorry, Mr. Sinatra,

402
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:39,100
-but I think Elvis
sang it better."
-[all laughing]

403
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:40,601
[boy] Oh, no.

404
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,238
Archie, are you all right?

405
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:46,207
You've been quiet all night.

406
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,809
Yeah, I'm good.

407
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:50,845
I was just...
I was just taking it all in.

408
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:53,281
-Soaking it up.
-Like the sponge that you are.

409
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,381
[men laughing]

410
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:02,023
I see you're
admiring the painting.

411
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,325
-It's a--
-It's a Monet. Am I right?

412
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:11,132
Indeed. You have
a connoisseur's eyes, Julian.

413
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:12,767
I appreciate beautiful things.

414
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:17,672
Every summer,
my family goes on
an art-buying tour in Europe.

415
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:19,841
Archie, what do you
think of the painting?

416
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:20,908
[slurps]

417
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:24,545
Um...

418
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:28,015
It's beautiful and all, uh...

419
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:34,088
I guess I just prefer
an artist like Norman Rockwell.

420
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,591
Then again, I'm not
really an art tour
through Europe kind of guy.

421
00:22:36,624 --> 00:22:39,994
-So--
-That's obvious from what
you're wearing, chump.

422
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:41,494
Where'd you get that suit?

423
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,231
Some thrift store?

424
00:22:43,264 --> 00:22:44,397
[boys chuckling]

425
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:46,499
It's my father's suit.

426
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:48,401
And you better
shut your trap, Blossom.

427
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,737
Wasn't he buried in his suit?

428
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:52,439
Or did he have more than one?

429
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:55,076
He was buried in his uniform.

430
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:59,213
Well, I, for one, think
you look very striking, Archie.

431
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:03,918
And I like a bit of variety
in my men's attire,
as well as in my men.

432
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:07,487
So, who's up for charades?

433
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,626
You know, Veronica,
it has been
a real swell night,

434
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:15,162
but, uh... I think I'm just
gonna blow out of here.

435
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:18,199
If I stay any longer,
I might be liable to spill
someone's blue blood

436
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:20,134
all over your nice,
expensive things.

437
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:24,772
[door slams]

438
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:47,460
Good morning, Mrs. Andrews.

439
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,730
As you may know,
I'm Veronica Lodge.

440
00:23:49,764 --> 00:23:51,732
Is Archie home,
by any chance?

441
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:53,901
He's at the grocery store.

442
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:55,703
Shopping? This early?

443
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:58,172
Archie told me everything
that happened last night.

444
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:02,176
Well, that's
actually why I'm here.

445
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:03,678
I feel terrible about it.

446
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:05,780
I didn't mean for things
to happen the way they did.

447
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:10,084
My Archie is not
some Hollywood playboy.

448
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:14,221
He's a simple boy. So simple
that he's mad at Julian Blossom

449
00:24:14,255 --> 00:24:16,924
and himself for what happened
at your little soiree,

450
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:20,428
when you and I both know
who the real villainess was.

451
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,730
[scoffs] I mean,
what kind of person

452
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:25,700
auditions boys
to go to a sock hop?

453
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,602
Well, when your parents
are actors... [chuckles]

454
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:33,473
Sorry. That's not an excuse.

455
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:35,676
Listen, if you hurt my boy,

456
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,745
you and I are going to have
some serious trouble,

457
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:40,581
Little Miss Femme Fatale.

458
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:48,723
-[Alice] <i>Thanks</i>
<i>for stopping by, Kevin.</i>
-[liquid pouring]

459
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:54,328
-High Point?
-Okay.

460
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:56,864
So, Betty tells me
that the two of you

461
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:59,934
have had some
troubles as of late.

462
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:01,102
Would you agree?

463
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:03,671
I feel awful, Mrs. Cooper.

464
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:07,008
It's like... Betty wants
these things from me,

465
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,810
but I'm not sure
if I can give them to her.

466
00:25:09,844 --> 00:25:12,179
It's perfectly normal
for girls Betty's age

467
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:13,981
to have certain... [inhales]

468
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:17,885
...expectations of
what their boyfriends
are willing to do.

469
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,155
May I make a suggestion?

470
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:25,059
I'm going to give you this.

471
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:32,199
You see, Betty
just wants to be pinned.

472
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:35,102
She wants to feel appreciated.

473
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:39,240
And then all of those...
feelings will settle.

474
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:41,976
But won't a pin mean
she'll expect more from me?

475
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:46,047
Oh, no. A pin
takes off the pressure.

476
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,017
You see, it's a symbol
for what every girl craves.

477
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:51,786
They just...
They just want a fella

478
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:54,055
that's going to carry
their books home from school

479
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:56,690
or take them to the movies
Saturday night

480
00:25:56,724 --> 00:25:58,926
or call them on the telephone
before supper.

481
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,327
Is that all?

482
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:04,665
A pin is a promise, Kevin.

483
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:08,537
Don't tell anyone,
but this is the actual pin

484
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:11,472
that Mr. Cooper gave me
back in high school.

485
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:12,973
See, this pin

486
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:19,213
somehow answered a desire
that we both were feeling,

487
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:23,017
and then things were
fine and pure
from that point forward.

488
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:25,086
You're a good boy, Kevin.

489
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:28,422
And Betty is a good girl.

490
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:34,662
And I believe that this pin
will take care of everything.

491
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,667
[chuckles nervously]

492
00:26:41,135 --> 00:26:44,605
Tickets. Get your tickets
for tonight's sock hop.

493
00:26:44,638 --> 00:26:46,006
-Hurry up!
-You, four eyes.

494
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,875
Get your tickets to
the sock hop yet?

495
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:49,910
Uh... no.

496
00:26:49,944 --> 00:26:51,513
Well, pony up, poindexter,

497
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:53,948
because my pal
Fangs Fogarty is performing.

498
00:26:53,981 --> 00:26:56,951
And trust me,
you'll be kicking yourself
if you miss it.

499
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:58,085
I'll take one.

500
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:02,289
Five. I'll take five.

501
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:10,764
By the way, did you, uh,
break the bad news
to Kevin yet?

502
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,033
No. But I will.

503
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:14,001
Can you dig it?

504
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:18,005
[bell rings]

505
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,708
Putting aside the fact
that you were drawing

506
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:22,910
while Dr. Doiley
was lecturing,

507
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:26,213
in and of itself
a flagrant violation

508
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:27,549
of school etiquette.

509
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:30,885
Dr. Werthers and I are also

510
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:33,988
deeply concerned about
what you were drawing.

511
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:37,559
Where did the vision
for this come from, Ethel?

512
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:41,061
Your subconscious?
A nightmare? The movies?

513
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:42,963
They're for a story.

514
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:45,132
What kind of story?

515
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:47,334
A comic book.

516
00:27:47,368 --> 00:27:48,736
That I'm on deadline to finish.

517
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,738
That's why I was drawing
in Dr. Doiley's class.

518
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:54,675
I'm... I'm trying to
get a job at Pep Comics.

519
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,512
They're based here in town.

520
00:27:57,546 --> 00:28:00,714
I'm sorry, Ethel,
but your budding career

521
00:28:00,748 --> 00:28:02,883
as an illustrator of
lurid comic books

522
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:06,153
doesn't remotely justify
this behavior.

523
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:09,156
You have a week's detention,
starting today.

524
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:14,895
[Archie] Veronica.

525
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,698
Archie. Hi.

526
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:19,867
Look, about last night...

527
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,069
I'm sorry I rushed
out of there like that.

528
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:24,271
I, uh...

529
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:31,580
I sincerely was going to
rip Julian Blossom's head off.

530
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:34,616
[chuckles] Well,
he would have deserved it.

531
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:38,018
And I'm mortified about
what he said to you.

532
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:41,755
I truly had a good time
getting to know you better.

533
00:28:43,824 --> 00:28:47,728
Well, um, in that case,

534
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:50,798
if you haven't made
your decision yet,

535
00:28:50,831 --> 00:28:53,033
I'm still keen on taking you
to the sock hop tonight.

536
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:58,439
I would love that, Archie,

537
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:02,943
but I've already
made my selection.

538
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:05,846
And...
I'm not going with anyone.

539
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:09,917
-What? Why?
-[Veronica sighs]

540
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,722
With so many excellent options,
it's simply impossible
for an it girl to choose.

541
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:16,890
Options like Julian Blossom?

542
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:19,226
[scoffs]

543
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,795
You know,
I don't get you, Veronica.

544
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:24,832
I mean, what was last night's
dog-and-pony show
all about then?

545
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,235
I mean, forget last night.
This entire week.

546
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:31,305
Making us... Making me
jump through hoops like that?

547
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,909
It was a game, Archie.

548
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:38,312
The queen of the hive
gets all her worker bees abuzz

549
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:44,184
and then flies away before...
Before anyone's
stung too badly.

[Betty] <i>So, have you</i>
<i>made your pick yet?</i>

551
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:57,464
Here's a late-breaking scoop
for Hedda Hopper.

552
00:29:57,498 --> 00:30:01,802
Socialite Veronica Lodge
has decided to go stag
to the sock hop.

553
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,406
Well, what happened?
What about Archie?

554
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:09,443
I'm in the midst of
a rude awakening, Betty.

555
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:12,913
Turns out I've been
careless and thoughtless

556
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:16,483
with a lot of the boys
at Riverdale High.

557
00:30:16,518 --> 00:30:21,523
Archie most especially,
and most undeservingly.

558
00:30:21,556 --> 00:30:23,090
Did you not like his poem?

559
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:25,459
What poem?

560
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:31,599
Archie wrote you a poem.
Did he not give it to you?

561
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:34,201
Not that I know of.

562
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:36,070
Not that I deserve,
in any case.

563
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:39,641
Wait a minute. So who's Archie
going to the sock hop with?

564
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:42,009
No one, as far as I know.

565
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,277
I'll tell you
one thing, though.

566
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,479
Whoever does
end up going with Archie,

567
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,615
she is one lucky girl.

568
00:31:30,124 --> 00:31:32,426
Hey, Betty,
can I talk to you
for a second?

569
00:31:33,795 --> 00:31:34,662
It's important.

570
00:31:38,365 --> 00:31:40,167
Sure, let's talk.

571
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:49,943
Cheryl bumped me
and the Crooners.

573
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:53,447
Apparently, he's God's gift
or something. [scoffs]

574
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,948
I heard. Kev, I'm sorry.

575
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:59,019
No, uh... I'm sorry.

576
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:01,455
Betty, I'm really...
I'm really sorry.

577
00:32:02,824 --> 00:32:04,224
I was a dope.

578
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:07,494
And you are the most wonderful,

579
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:11,231
most ginchiest girl
in the world,
and I took that for granted.

580
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,200
That won't happen again. Um...

581
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:18,172
Betty Cooper,
will you go steady with me?

582
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:24,779
-Kevin...
-Things will be
different this time.

583
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:26,480
I promise. I...

584
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:30,919
I love you, Betty. I do.

585
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:32,687
And you make
my heart feel full.

586
00:32:34,054 --> 00:32:35,623
So will you be my girl?

587
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:39,293
Will you go
to the sock hop with me?

588
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:43,865
Yeah, of course.

589
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:45,999
-Yeah?
-Yeah. [chuckles]

590
00:32:47,735 --> 00:32:48,670
All right.

591
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,041
Um...

592
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:57,377
Uh...

593
00:32:57,411 --> 00:32:59,848
-[chuckles nervously]
How do I...
-I'll... I'll do it.

594
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:01,281
Okay.

595
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:02,382

for her assigned detention?

The Muggs girl.

599
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:20,635
I'm concerned, Felix.
I... I think we should speak
to Ethel's parents.

<i>God knows</i>
<i>what's troubling that girl.</i>

601
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:30,745
Now, you want me to believe
that a girl, this girl,

602
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:32,412
generated these pages?

603
00:33:32,446 --> 00:33:36,149
Yes, and she's currently
skipping detention

604
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:38,753
because of how badly she wants
to draw comic books for you,

605
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:41,789
Mr. Fieldstone.

606
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:46,761
[inhales] Well, young lady,
let me congratulate you.

607
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:50,532
These are the most putrid pages
I've seen in a long time.

608
00:33:50,565 --> 00:33:53,233
And that's the highest
compliment I can give
any artist.

some real talent.

00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:57,939
Ethel.

612
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:59,807
Thank you, Mr. Fieldstone.

613
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:03,176
Well, freckles,
you and boy wonder here
make a terrific team.

614
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,313
So, what are you,
boyfriend-girlfriend?

615
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:07,247
Uh, no.

616
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:09,283
We are just creative partners.

617
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:13,086
-But we are going
to the sock hop together.
-Ah.

My apologies, Miss Veronica.

621
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:23,765
But I was emptying the bins
and came across something

622
00:34:23,798 --> 00:34:26,133
that I believe belongs to you.

623
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:29,102
What's this?

624
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:32,072
It seems to be a poem, miss.

625
00:34:46,153 --> 00:34:47,855
Mom, Dad,
is everything all right?

626
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:49,423
We got called
down to your school.

627
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,759
They said you're acting
like some delinquent.

inviting boys into your bedroom

631
00:34:58,066 --> 00:34:59,567
and now missing detention?

632
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:02,070
We did not raise
you this way, Ethel.

633
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:04,005
Maybe if you didn't
drink so much, Mom.

634
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:06,440
And maybe if you weren't so
miserable all of the time, Dad.

635
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:07,976
The hell did
you just say to me?

636
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:09,343
Never mind.

00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:10,645
[Mr. Muggs] Where
do you think you're going?

638
