never took place.

Of course not,

Has Ethel Muggs
been talking much

6
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:14,749

with the Sisters?

7
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:16,316
Not a peep.

a vow of silence.

-What about the PTA?
-[Featherhead]
Parents are still upset.

11

It's all they talk about
at our meetings.

12
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,528
Who killed
Mr. and Mrs. Muggs?

focused on this murder case,

What's the
Sheriff's office doing?

17
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:40,975
Tom is trying
to find this "milkman"

18
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:42,042
and the murder weapon.

19
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,611
Why is he doing that?

20
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:50,217
I have the murder weapon
right here.

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,619
What are you
getting at, Fredreich?

22
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:53,320
[Dr. Werthers]
We have to stop rehashing

23
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,056
the Muggs murder case
and start making sure

24
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,960
that something like it
never happens again.

25
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:02,329
In my extensive research,
in case after case,

26
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:07,267
comic books
are the influencing factor
in most incidents

27

and teen violence.

28

They are
a moral scourge, gentlemen.

<i>And their creators,</i>
<i>criminal degenerates.</i>

30

32
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,886
Not the Muggs.

37
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:41,335
I was just
in the neighborhood.

Yeah, that's no problem,
Mr. Fieldstone.

46

I'm fast.
I'm a great speller.

Four stories.
Seven pages each.

If you like them, then great.

51
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,625
And if not,
there's plenty more
where that came from.

52
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:05,292
Right.

53
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,096
If you have trouble
coming up with some ideas,

Gosh, Bernie,

Bernie, you're a genius.

62
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,286
What about stories
about teenagers
and high school?

63
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,690
Pep Comics doesn't have
any of those, right?

relate to them.

do buy our books.

Well, shucks,

What about a narrator

69

that's actually
a witchy lunch lady,
or a creepy janitor?

70
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:52,974
We can call it
"Homeroom of Horrors."

71

Huh?

will bite?

Sure.

Ooh. Could we go
tomorrow, maybe?

I'm on deadline.

85
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,174
Al's asked me to write
an entire issue by morning.

86
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,442
An entire issue?

87
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,978
Sounds like
a bit of a coup for you.

88
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:32,212
Yeah, it is.

89
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,614
But it's also
a lot of pressure.

90
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,717
Though, if I do a bang up job
on these pages tonight,

91
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,952
Fieldstone could ask me
to be one of his go-to's.

92
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,054
Okay. Okay.

93
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:42,623
My French thriller about
murderous schoolteachers
can wait.

94
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:46,027
But since I'm here,
maybe I can help you.

95

How far have you gotten?

What's it about?

00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,332
Sports-themed.

99
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,102
Because what's scarier
than gym class?

100
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:55,335
And it has a narrator,

101
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,105

102
00:03:57,138 --> 00:03:59,974

<i>Dilton had suffered</i>
<i>a complete psychotic break.</i>

175
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:27,248
<i>He was a changed man.</i>

176
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,884
<i>A madman, you might say.</i>

177
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:34,221
<i>Hell-bent on revenge</i>
<i>against the Bulldogs.</i>

178
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:37,758
[glass breaks]

179
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,994
[Key-Keeper] <i>Then it was just</i>
<i>a matter of lying in wait</i>

180
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:43,496
<i>for his teammates</i>
<i>to reconvene</i>
<i>for basketball practice</i>

181
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,900
<i>later that afternoon.</i>

182
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:50,171
<i>Luckily, Dilton had</i>
<i>the perfect hidey-hole</i>

183
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:53,841
<i>from which to pop out</i>
<i>and surprise his teammates.</i>

184
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,511
<i>After which Dilton</i>
<i>could dedicate himself</i>

185
00:07:57,545 --> 00:08:01,382
<i>to perfecting</i>
<i>his free throw technique.</i>

186
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,050
Gotta keep
my head in the game.

187
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:05,653
Gotta keep my head
in the game.

188
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,221
[Kleats] Attaboy, Doiley!

189
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:30,711
Help! [yelling]

190
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:33,481
Gotta keep
my head in the game.

191
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,616
Gotta keep
my head in the game.

192
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:38,753
Gotta keep
my head in the game.

193
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,755
Gotta keep
my head in the game.

194
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,390
Gotta keep
my head in the game.

195
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:43,824
[screeching]

196
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,627
[woman screaming]

197
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,498
Good for Dilton.

198
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,466
Those awful bullies
got what was coming to them.

199
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,667
Exactly.

200
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,369
And you see, that's what
nitwits like Werthers

201
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:56,971
just don't understand.

202
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,172
What, exactly?

203
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,774
Well, that these
so-called "degenerate" comics

204
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,476
are actually bite-sized
morality tales.

205
00:09:02,511 --> 00:09:03,711
Especially those that involve

206
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,846
Julian Blossom getting
his head chopped off.

207
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,848
I mean, you joke,
but it's true.

208
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:10,484
Yes, comics can be
over the top
and bloody sometimes,

209
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,654
but in these stories,
people that break the rules
get punished.

210
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,689
People who are cruel
to others get punished.

211
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:18,092
People who have lustful sex
get punished.

212
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,394
Lustful sex, did you say?

213
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:22,463
Tell me more
about that, Juggiekins.

214
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,398
[chuckles] I've got a tale
for you.

215
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:26,000
And it starts,
believe it or not,

216
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,402
-on a dark and stormy night...
-[thunder rumbling]

217
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:32,773
With a flat tire
near an isolated mansion.

218
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:36,677
<i>And a young, strapping man</i>
<i>in need of assistance.</i>

219
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,679
[thunder rumbling]

220
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,183
Yes?

221
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:43,217
May I help you?

222
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,885
I'm sorry to bother you
at this hour, ma'am,

223
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,456
but my hot rod got
a flat tire down the road.

224
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,257
Must've ran over a nail
or something.

225
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,560
[Nana Rose] Oh, how dreadful.

226
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:55,162
And now here you are, stranded,
you poor dear.

227
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:56,764
Why don't you come inside?

228
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:00,234
You can use our telephone
to call the garage.

229
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:04,305
At this hour?
Oh, they'll be closed, ma'am.

230
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:07,608
Would it be too much trouble
if I stayed the night?

231
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,844
That way, in the morning,
I can call the garage

232
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,345
and I'll be out of your hair.

233
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:12,446
[thunder rumbling]

234
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,248
I suppose. But...

235
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,151
I'm afraid the storm
has knocked out our power.

236
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,386
But you can warm yourself
by the fire.

237
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,188
Well, come in.

238
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:22,323
Come in.

239
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,657
Oh, you look a fright.

240
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:24,859
[thunder rumbling]

241
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:30,931
[Key-Keeper]
<i>They say a picture</i>
<i>is worth 1,000 words,</i>

242
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:34,168
<i>but I only need two</i>
<i>for this one.</i>

243
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,036
<i>Hubba-hubba.</i>

244
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,439
[slurping]

245
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,374
[gulps and clears throat]

246
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:42,544
Thank you for the tea, ma'am.

247
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:46,480
It's... I already feel better.

248
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:50,384
There's not much
in this world that
a strong cup of tea

249
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,453
and a roaring fire can't fix.

250
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:56,558
And you're welcome to stay
in my guest room tonight.

251
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:58,259
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

252
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,561
That's very kind of you.

253
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:04,798
However, there are one or two
ground rules you must observe.

254
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,433
Of course.

255
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:07,701
Of course. Anything.

256
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:11,839
Once you're in your room,
you must stay there.

257
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:13,642
All night.

258
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:17,211
And you must lock the door,
and keep it locked

259
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,581
for the entire night.

260
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:22,883
Any particular reason why?

261
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,586
[Nana Rose] Alas, yes.

262
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:27,421
I am not alone
in this house.

263
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,558
My granddaughter
lives with me,

264
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:33,727
and she's not quite
in her right mind.

265
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,897
She has this
compulsive craving

266
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:38,933
for intimate, physical,

267
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:44,872
some might even say
inappropriate touching.

268
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:46,608
Really?

269
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:49,710
Oh, yes.
She's ravenous for it.

270
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:52,880
Can't keep her hands
to herself.

271
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,485
Wow. That's...

272
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,722
I mean, that sounds... Wow.

273
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:05,326
She's even been known
to sneak into the bedrooms

274
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:08,896
of strange young men
in the middle of the night

275
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:12,900
in order to get her "fix,"
as it were.

276
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,835
[thunder rumbling]

277
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,911
Is... that your granddaughter?

278
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,648
Yes, it is.

279
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:28,449
She's beautiful, isn't she?

280
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,785
Well, it's getting late.

281
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,488
Let's get you settled,
shall we?

282
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:43,163
[Key-Keeper] <i>Surely some rules</i>
<i>were meant to be broken,</i>

283
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:45,700
<i>especially when</i>
<i>the consequences might prove</i>

284
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:49,903
<i>to be downright titillating.</i>

285
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:55,843
[door creaking]

286
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:09,790
[curtains ruffling]

287
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,191
[Cheryl] You're here.

288
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,596
You came.

289
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,830
Are you the old lady's
granddaughter?

290
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,932
Yes. I'm Cheryl.

291
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,368
I'm so glad you're here.

292
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:26,807
It's been so long
since I've gotten to touch...
like this.

293
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,612
I... sure am happy
to be here, too.

294
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:31,546
Let me just light a candle.

295
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:33,213
-No! No!
-Whoa.

296
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:34,248
No.

297
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,083
What we're about to do
is best...

298
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,152
It's best done in darkness.

299
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,788
Now kiss me.

300
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,957
And let me... feel you.

301
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:47,127
[kissing]

302
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:52,032
[Key-Keeper]
<i>Avert your eyes, pervert,</i>
<i>and turn the page,</i>

303
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:55,969
<i>to a bright new day.</i>

304
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,945
[Nana Rose]
<i>How was your night,</i>
<i>young man?</i>

305
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,481
Did you sleep well?

306
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:12,186
It was... incredible.
[laughs]

307
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,622
Thank you again
for the hospitality, ma'am.

308
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:17,692
I, uh...
I saw your granddaughter,

309
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:20,160
I think, by the window.

310
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:22,731
So what's wrong with her?

311
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:24,131
Some kind of mental illness?

312
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,768
Oh, Cheryl was once
youthful and vibrant,

313
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:29,403
like any young girl her age.

314
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,372
But she wanted adventure.

315
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:33,775
And I couldn't help
but indulge her.

316
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:38,078
She took a trip
to some tropical jungle

317
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:39,413
in some far-off place,

318
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,851
and unfortunately,
while she was there,

319
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,887
she contracted
a rare form of leprosy.

320
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,392
Leprosy?

321
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:55,262
Horrible, terrible,
disfiguring disease.

322
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,898
Rotting her swollen flesh away,

323
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,367
and incredibly painful.

324
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:01,703
[gulps]

325
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,270
Now she can't be
around other people

326
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,306
because it's
so very contagious,
you know.

327
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:11,345
But, I mean, you don't...

328
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:15,349
Oh, no,
I was exposed as a child,

329
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,785
and so I'm immune.

330
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:18,720
I don't suppose you...

331
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:20,655
Am immune? No.

332
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:24,692
Mercifully,
she'll soon succumb
to the leprosy and die,

333
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:26,093
which is why

334
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,629
I do everything in my power

335
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:33,902
to ensure that she relishes
her final days on Earth.

336
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,837
[sputtering]
What do you mean?

337
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,304
What do you mean by that?

338
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,675
It was no accident
that brought you here,
young man.

339
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:45,078
How do you think those nails
got onto that road?

340
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,082
I did warn you.

341
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:53,655
I gave you a chance
to lock that door
and be a good boy.

342
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:57,491
And now you're almost
certainly infected as well.

343
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:58,860
[Cheryl] After last night,

344
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:02,697
we're going to be together
forever, and ever

345
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,031
till death do us part.

346
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,234
[screaming]

347
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,008
Well, that was grotesque.

348
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:17,277
What was the moral there?

349
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,813
Don't trust creepy old ladies

350
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:22,817
and their nymphomaniac,
leprosy-ridden
granddaughters?

351
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:27,655
Well, it's more of
a "curiosity killed the cat"
message, I think.

352
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:29,122
Ah.

353
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,158
Or don't engage
in heavy petting
in the dark with someone,

354
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,260
if you haven't got
proper protection. [chuckles]

355
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:38,633
You know, I'm hearing
that Archie and Cheryl
broke up,

356
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,069
and that in the end,
they didn't do much more
than neck...

357
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,872
Oh, yeah? Well...

358
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:47,809
Who can keep up
with all the horny teens
at Riverdale High?

359
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:51,011
I mean, what else
is there to do?

360
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:55,015
That's why God created
high school.

361
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,919
So there'd be a place
where boys could...

362
00:16:57,952 --> 00:17:00,755
chase girls and vice versa.

363
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:03,390
Yeah.

364
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,959
I mean...

365
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:06,594
girls will do
just about anything

366
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:07,862
to get a boy's attention.

367
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:11,365
Including feigning an interest
in comic books, apparently.

368
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:17,839

375
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:39,293

And now,
how can I help you, hun?

378
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:49,604
I would like
a new look, please.

379
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:52,339
Oh, what's giving you

unseen.

383
00:17:58,513 --> 00:18:00,949
All the girls
at my school have beaus,

384
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:04,251
and it's just like
I'm a, uh...

385
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:06,020
ghost.

386
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:07,522
I need something...

387
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:09,757
else, something new.

388
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,993
Something amazing
that will get
all the boys' attention.

389
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:13,628
[hairdresser]
Well, I've got to tell you,

390
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:16,064
this ponytail
is doing you no favors.

391
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,331
But, but, but,

392
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:20,300
I just came back
from my fabulous
honeymoon abroad.

393
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:23,905
And there's this new hairstyle
that is all the rage in Europe.

394
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:24,973
Really? What is it?

395
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:28,442
[hairdresser]
It's called the Beehive.

396
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:29,544
"Beehive."

397
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,412
Sounds sophisticated.

398
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:33,615
Oh, it is.

399
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:35,583
So we tease up all your hair,
put in some extensions,

400
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:39,219
and then we roll it all up
into a dome,
just like a hive.

401
00:18:40,722 --> 00:18:42,056
A hive-hive?

402
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,256
I know it sounds
a little silly,

403
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,559
but wait till you see it.

404
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:46,126
All the girls
in England and France,

405
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,260
they just love it.

406
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,997
And the boys,
they're crazy about it.

407
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,065
And, on my mother's grave,

408
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,867
may she rest in peace...

409
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,470
you're going to get
all the attention
you've ever wanted,

410
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:57,505
and then some.

411
00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:59,907
What the heck?

412
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:02,510
If it's good enough
for the Parisians,
it's good enough for me.

413
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:03,911
[hairdresser] Oh, smart girl.

414
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,780
You're going to look so chic.

415
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:08,116
Now, there's just one thing.

416
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,150
Once we get
your goldie locks
up into the hive,

417
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:11,919
you're not gonna be able
to wash your hair

418
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:13,487
or undo it, ever.

419
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:17,357
Oh. Well, how do I
maintain it?

420
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:19,159
With this. Hair spray.

421
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:22,362
Use throughout the day
as needed.

422
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:25,133
Well, my mom says,
I'm supposed
to wash my hair

423
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,200
every other day
or at least once a week.

424
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:29,704
With all due respect
to your dear mama,

425
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:30,972
I'm the professional.

426
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,774

to look beautiful.

would be nice.

519
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:17,224
Or something that focuses
on female friendship.

520
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:18,659
Yeah, what if we did a flip

521
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:21,461
of the classic teenage
love triangle?

522
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:22,763
One in which the girls

523
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:25,498
don't go at each other's
throats and cat-fight.

524
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:27,802
Now, you're singing my tune.

525
00:24:29,737 --> 00:24:34,008
Presenting my fourth and final
story of the evening.

526
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:37,812
A terror tale I'm calling
"My Better Half."

527
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:41,682
Archie's a good egg.

528
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:46,387
But a half-wit when it comes
to decision-making.

529
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,456
He struggles
with the most basic

530
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,458
of all
multiple-choice questions.

531
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,462
Should he go
for A, "The girl next door?"

532
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:58,399
Or B,
"The rich starlet-socialite?"

533
00:24:58,432 --> 00:25:01,702
But in a rare stroke
of mad genius,

534
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:05,406
Archie chose C,
"Both of the above."

535
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:07,675
<i>So, on Mondays,</i>
<i>Wednesdays and Fridays,</i>

536
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,176
<i>Archie takes Betty out.</i>

537
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,579
<i>And on Tuesdays,</i>
<i>Thursdays and Saturdays,</i>

538
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,681
<i>he takes out Veronica.</i>

539
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:16,517
<i>The one downside</i>
<i>to this break-neck schedule</i>

540
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,552
<i>was that Archie would,</i>
<i>on occasion,</i>

541
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:21,722
<i>collapse from sheer exhaustion.</i>

542
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:24,358
<i>But it was nothing</i>
<i>that couldn't be rectified</i>

543
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:26,160
<i>with a strong cup of coffee.</i>

544
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,928
<i>Or four.</i>

545
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:30,031
<i>But even for</i>
<i>a strapping young buck,</i>

546
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:33,200
<i>six dates a week</i>
<i>will wear a fella out.</i>

547
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:35,803
<i>That's why Archie</i>
<i>saved Sundays for himself.</i>

548
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:39,974
<i>To rest, recover, and replenish</i>
<i>for the week ahead.</i>

549
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:44,979
<i>Now, you might think Archie</i>

550
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:47,281
<i>would try to keep</i>
<i>his relationships a secret.</i>

551
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:48,749
<i>But he didn't.</i>

552
00:25:48,783 --> 00:25:51,185
<i>Betty and Veronica</i>
<i>knew he was dating the other.</i>

553
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:56,957
<i>Still, each girl wanted Archie</i>
<i>all to herself.</i>

554
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:58,392
They're playing
<i>Double Indemnity</i>

555
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,161
at the Babylonium
tomorrow night,

556
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:02,696
if you want to play
a little back row bingo.

557
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,534
Oh, I wish I could swing it,
but I got plans.

558
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:08,135
Meaning you've got a date
with Veronica.

559
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:11,372
When are you going to drop
that vapid airhead?

560
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:13,374
Oh, please. Don't get razzled.

561
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,909
Why shouldn't I?

562
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:19,313
Having to share my beau
with that smelly tomboy.

563
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:20,549
Don't I make you happy?

564
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:22,216
Of course you do.

565
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:24,852
Then why aren't I enough?

566
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:27,888
Oh, come on,
it's not like that.

567
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:30,624
Hey, you guys
are both so different.

568
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:33,094
But let me let you in
on a little secret.

569
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:38,599
[whispers] You're my favorite.

570
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:41,302
[both] Really?

571
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:42,870
Oh, Archie.

572
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:48,676
How do you do it, Andrews?

573
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:51,045
Two broads at the same time.
What's your secret?

574
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:54,915
All right, listen,
'cause I'm only gonna
say this once, okay?

575
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:57,051
You tell them
what they want to hear.

576
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:59,753
That yes,
I'm seeing other girls,

577
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:03,324
but I'm only serious
about you.

578
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:07,661
Okay? You feed them
the same three simple words.

579
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,167
"You're my favorite."

580
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,201
[boys snicker]

581
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:17,638
Technically, that's four words.

582
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:19,574
"You're" is a contraction.

583
00:27:19,608 --> 00:27:20,774
"You are my favorite."

584
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:23,978
-Four words.
-Shut up, Doiley.

585
00:27:24,011 --> 00:27:26,814
We're learning
from Don Juan here.

586
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:32,153
But don't you ever get...
exhausted?

587
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:34,021
Sure.

588
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:37,158
But that's why God
invented Sundays and coffee.

589
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:39,093
[boys laughing]

590
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:41,563
Things might've kept
humming along as is

591
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:42,930
until graduation day,

592
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:46,433
but the <i>Good Ship Archie</i>
was headed for an iceberg,

593
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:47,935
Valentine's Day,

594
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:51,672
<i>which, this year, disastrously,</i>
<i>landed on a Sunday.</i>

595
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:53,007
So, Veronica,
who's the lucky guy

596
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,176
taking you out
for Valentine's Day?

597
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:58,379
-Archiekins, of course.
-Keep dreaming.

598
00:27:58,412 --> 00:27:59,614
Archie is my date.

599
00:27:59,648 --> 00:28:01,516
You know, Betty,
for a smart girl,

600
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,050
you really are dense.

601
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:06,621
Archie is going to spend V-Day
with his best girl.

602
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:07,955
And that's me.

603
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:09,490
-Says you.
-Says him.

604
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:13,562
Archiekins says the only reason
he spends so much time with you

605
00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:15,630
is because
you're a charity case.

606
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:19,767
First of all, he hates
being called Archiekins.

607
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,670
Second of all, the only reason

608
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:23,638
he spends any time
with you at all

609
00:28:23,672 --> 00:28:26,273
is because your ego
is so fragile

610
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:29,611
he's afraid you might do
something desperate or crazy

611
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:30,778
if he breaks up with you.

612
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:32,581
He said I'm fragile?

613
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:35,115
Oh, as a Glamerge egg.

614
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,251
Well, he told me
you're so high-strung

615
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:41,055
you sometimes take your mom's
sleeping pills to go to bed.

616
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,290
-He told you that?
-Mmm-hmm.

617
00:28:43,324 --> 00:28:46,760
Sounds like someone's been
playing you two for fools.

618
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:50,699
[scoffs]

619
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:52,634
[both] That rat-fink!

620
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:54,401
Archie, you have
to choose right now.

621
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:56,605
Who's going to be your date
for Valentine's Day?

622
00:28:56,638 --> 00:28:58,239
And after you pick me,
of course,

623
00:28:58,272 --> 00:29:00,241
you need to end things
with Betty permanently.

624
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:03,744
Ladies, ladies,
let's all calm down.

625
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:06,013
In fact...

626
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:08,449
neither of you can be my date
on Valentine's Day.

627
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:10,017
[both] Why not?

628
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,354
'Cause I'm taking my mom.

629
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:15,456
You see, it's...

630
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:18,225
It's her first Valentine's Day
without my dad, and...

631
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:21,929
And, well, she needs me.

632
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:24,965
I hope you guys can understand.

633
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:27,669
Archie, of course
we understand.

634
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:29,504
That's so sweet and thoughtful.

635
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:31,640
I'm sorry we pressured you.

636
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:33,708
Me, too. It was her idea.

637
00:29:33,742 --> 00:29:35,909
Well, you guys shouldn't
have to miss out

638
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,579
on Valentine's Day
on account of me.

639
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:39,681
I mean, there must be some
other guys you can go out with.

640
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:41,616
Yeah, Betty,
find somebody else.

641
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,652
No. No, it's really okay.

642
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:45,085
There's an extra credit report

643
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,820
that I've been
putting off, so...

644
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:48,956
As for me, <i>Mademoiselle</i>
just published a recipe

645
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:51,358
for an egg-white face mask
I've been dying to try.

646
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:53,127
So that'll keep me busy.

647
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,264
Okay, so you're both staying in
this Sunday night, then?

648
00:30:03,837 --> 00:30:05,973
[music playing on record]

649
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:09,778
But when Sunday night
rolled around...

650
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,814
Betty and Veronica decided
against staying in,

651
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:16,584
and went on a Valentine's date,

652
00:30:16,618 --> 00:30:18,285
together.

653
00:30:19,587 --> 00:30:24,258
So, imagine their surprise
when who should walk in but...

654
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:31,465
-He wouldn't.
-He couldn't.

655
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:33,300
[both] That rat-fink!

656
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,007
[Betty] Wait.

657
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,009
Whatever you're about to do...

658
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,513
I have a much better idea.

659
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:56,725
Betty. Veronica.

660
00:30:56,758 --> 00:30:58,158
What's going on?

661
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:00,461
We were wondering
how your Valentine's date went

662
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:01,830
with your mom.

663
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:04,965
Yeah, it was nice. Quiet.

664
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,401
Why?

665
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:10,304
Well, because a night-off
gave us a chance to reflect,

666
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:13,040
and since you've been
having such a hard time

667
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:15,710
deciding between the two of us,

668
00:31:15,744 --> 00:31:17,244
we were thinking...

669
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:20,615
what if you had us both?

670
00:31:23,618 --> 00:31:26,019
At the exact same time,

671
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:29,289
for a very, very special date?

672
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:32,694
Really?

673
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:33,994
[both] Really.

674
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:37,832
Say no more.

675
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:38,800
I'll pick you both up tonight,

676
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,067
we'll head over
to Lover's Lane.

677
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,837
I know the perfect spot.
Nice and private.

678
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:46,407
Actually, Betty had
an interesting idea.

679
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,878
I was thinking we could meet
in shop class.

680
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,580
After hours, of course.

681
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:53,782
Why would we go there?

682
00:31:53,815 --> 00:31:55,617
-[both chuckle]
-Don't you know?

683
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:58,152
It's sound-proof.

684
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:03,490
And we plan on making
a lot of noise.

685
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:12,966
[both] Come, Archie. Join us.

686
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:18,840
Wait.

687
00:32:18,873 --> 00:32:20,675
You're forgetting something.

688
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,445
Your coffee.

689
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:26,748
We took the liberty
of brewing it

690
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:28,282
extra strong for you tonight.

691
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:31,786
Oh, guys, I really don't think
I'm gonna need a boost tonight.

692
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,455
Now, now, no need to posture.

693
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:37,926
You'll want all your energy
for what we have planned.

694
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:38,860
Promise.

695
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:41,462
Cross our hearts
and hope to die.

696
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:48,703
Mmm.

697
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:58,212
[echoing] Everything all right,
Archiekins?

698
00:32:58,245 --> 00:33:00,515
[echoing]
Yeah, no, I'm good. I just...

699
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,496
[normal]
Someone's waking up, Vee.

700
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,899
[Veronica] I think
you're right, Bee.

701
00:33:17,932 --> 00:33:20,067
Welcome back, handsome.

702
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,103
What's happening?

703
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:24,371
Apologies if you're

704
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:26,073
experiencing
a splitting headache.

705
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,909
I wasn't sure how many
of my mom's sleeping pills

706
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:29,376
to slip into your coffee.

707
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:32,212
Whatever it is,
I'm sure we can figure it out.

708
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,414
But it's already
been figured out, silly.

709
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,985
Trust us.
This is a perfect solution.

710
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:40,153
After all, a problem shared
is a problem solved.

711
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:43,023
-Shall we, Vee?
-After you, Bee.

712
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:45,092
Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait!

713
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:48,061
Wait, hold on! Hold on!

714
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:52,867
[screaming]

715
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:56,004
Stop! Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

716
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:59,139
This won't hurt... much.

717
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:01,676
[both] We just want
to double our fun.

718
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:04,244

719
00:34:12,854 --> 00:34:14,388

00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:32,205

<i>he was a half-wit?</i>

726
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,841
-[woman screaming]
-[Key-Keeper chuckling]

727
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:40,715
Well?

728
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:43,317
What did you think of that
tag-team twist at the end?

729
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,854
O. Henry, eat your heart out,
am I right?

730
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:50,592
I have... opinions.

731
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,092
Okey-dokey.

732
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,197
I'm detecting
a pattern, Jughead.

733
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,367
The sexual politics
in most of your stories

734
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,005
are troubling,
to say the least.

735
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:06,774
[chuckles softly]
Veronica, my gosh,

736
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:10,377
you may be overthinking this.

737
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,714
These stories
are just meant to be a gas.

738
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:13,881
For whom?

739
00:35:13,915 --> 00:35:17,117
Not teen girls, not when you're
depicting them like...

740
00:35:18,086 --> 00:35:20,888
shallow, crazy killers.

741
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,389
Is that what you think of us?

742
00:35:23,024 --> 00:35:25,026
No. Of course not.

743
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:27,227
The boys
aren't great shakes, either.

744
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,496
So you admit
you're demonizing women?

745
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:33,200
Veronica, it's just
a comic book.

746
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,645
Anyhoo, I'm done now.

747
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:45,980
Why don't we try to catch
that last showing of <i>Diabolique</i>

748
00:35:46,014 --> 00:35:47,180
at the Babylonium?

749
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:48,783
What do you say? My treat.

750
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:54,122
I think I'll take a page
from your last story

751
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:55,790
and split.

752
00:35:57,692 --> 00:36:00,928
What's going on?
Are we not copacetic anymore?

753
00:36:00,962 --> 00:36:02,096
Of course we are.

754
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,632
I'm just tired, is all.

755
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,200
I'll catch you
at school tomorrow, promise.

756
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:10,571
[Jughead] <i>And as easy as that,</i>

757
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:16,410
<i>whatever bubble Veronica and I</i>
<i>had been in, just burst.</i>

758
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:20,748
<i>Tomorrow, at school,</i>
<i>things would be different.</i>

759
00:36:20,782 --> 00:36:23,151
<i>We'd no longer be</i>
<i>the Marilyn Monroe</i>

760
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,352
<i>and Arthur Miller</i>
<i>of Riverdale High.</i>

761
00:36:25,385 --> 00:36:26,921
<i>We'd pass each other</i>
<i>in the hall,</i>

762
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:28,823
<i>but she'd once again be</i>
<i>the beautiful socialite,</i>

763
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:31,726
<i>and I'd be the melvin</i>
<i>who writes comic books.</i>

764
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:36,363
<i>The kind that hopefully</i>

765
00:36:36,396 --> 00:36:38,432
[Featherhead] <i>"Don't be fooled</i>
<i>by their name.</i>

766
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:40,568
<i>These publications</i>
<i>are anything but comic.</i>

767
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:43,738
In their pages,
crime is glorified.

768
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:48,643
Acts of wanton carnality
are celebrated.

769
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:53,014
Stabbings and beheadings
and disembowelings
are commonplace,

770
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:54,414
<i>vividly depicted,</i>

771
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:57,552
<i>and offered up to our children</i>
<i>like so much bubblegum.</i>

772
00:36:57,585 --> 00:37:00,154
If anyone doubts
the insidious effects

773
00:37:00,188 --> 00:37:01,455
of this subversive medium,

774
00:37:01,488 --> 00:37:04,092
let me stress
what my extensive research

775
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,425
has proven time and again.

776
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:08,261
There's a direct
and undeniable link

777
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:11,165
between gruesome acts
of brutality depicted

778
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,667
in the pages of comic books,

779
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,837
and similar acts of savagery
committed in real life

780
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:19,473
by the juveniles
who read these comics books.

781
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:21,209
Our children are being seduced

782
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:26,279
<i>-by violence, by sex,</i>
<i>by depravity.</i>

785
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,188
I congratulate you,
Dr. Werthers.

786
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:36,256
That's a brilliant editorial.

787
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:39,560
The soon-to-be-forgotten
Muggs murders,

788
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:41,696
small potatoes compared
to the threat to America

789
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:44,065
that you have outlined
here for us tonight.

790
00:37:44,098 --> 00:37:45,298
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

791
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:48,401
I consider it my civic
and moral duty.

792
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:51,338
That's why
these so-called creators

793
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:56,276
of these dangerous and morally
reprehensible stories

794
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:57,712
must be held accountable

795
00:37:57,745 --> 00:38:01,649
and punished to the full extent
of the law.

796
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,486

799

Thank you, Mr. Fieldstone.
I, um...

800
00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:14,796
I needed a win today.

801
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:16,429
Oh, how come?

802
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:19,767
Ah, let me guess.
Girl trouble?

803
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:21,702
Yeah.

804
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:25,372
I... kinda had
this sweet thing going
with this one gal,

805
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:28,441
but then she read
my comics and, um...

806
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,478
Well, she took it
the wrong way.

807
00:38:31,512 --> 00:38:33,514
I don't think she liked
what I was saying.

808
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:35,283
I don't even know
what that means.

809
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:36,383
But you busted your ass

810
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:39,452
to turn those stories
around overnight.

811
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,122
And I think you deserve

812
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:42,523
a little something extra
for that.

813
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:45,193
-A bonus?
-God, no. What are you, nuts?

814
00:38:45,226 --> 00:38:47,228
No, I'm thinking, um, credit.

815
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:49,063
-Your name...
-On the cover?

816
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:52,033
God, no. A byline.

817
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:54,869
-On the inside. But still...
-It's my name in print.

818
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:58,338
Oh, golly, that would be
incredible, Mr. Fieldstone.

819
00:38:58,371 --> 00:38:59,740
I mean, my friends would flip.

820
00:38:59,774 --> 00:39:03,077
How does
Jughead "Jugular" Jones

821
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,545
sound for a byline?

822
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:07,347
Oh... [whistles]
I'm crazy for it.

823
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,549
[laughs] Yeah.

824
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,450
Now, you listen to me, kid,

825
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:13,254
I don't know much,
but I do know this.

Girls come and go.

827
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:16,924
But your name in print,

828
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:21,095
now that's a thing
that'll make people
sit up and take notice.
