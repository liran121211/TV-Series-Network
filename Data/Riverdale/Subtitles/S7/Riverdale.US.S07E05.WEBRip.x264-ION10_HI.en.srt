- Oh, God, no.

673
00:38:44,207 --> 00:38:45,167
What, are you nuts?

674
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,127
No, I'm thinking credit.

675
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,754
- Your name...
- On the cover?

676
00:38:48,837 --> 00:38:51,632
God, no. A byline.

677
00:38:52,174 --> 00:38:53,675
On the inside, but still.

678
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:55,010
It's my name in print.

679
00:38:55,093 --> 00:38:58,347
Oh, golly, that would be incredible,
Mr. Fieldstone.

680
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,848
My friends would flip.

681
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:03,852
How does Jughead "Jugular" Jones
sound for a byline?

682
00:39:04,812 --> 00:39:06,064
Oh. [WHISTLES]

683
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:08,441
- I'm crazy for it.
- Yeah.

684
00:39:08,524 --> 00:39:10,360
Now, you listen to me, kid.

685
00:39:10,443 --> 00:39:13,154
I don't know much, but do I know this.

686
00:39:13,237 --> 00:39:16,407
Girls come and go, but your name in print?

687
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:20,495
That's a thing that'll make people
sit up and take notice.

688
00:39:21,663 --> 00:39:23,206
[JUGHEAD] <i>Little did any of us imagine</i>

689
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:26,417
{\an8}<i>how prophetic Mr. Fieldstone's words
would turn out to be.</i>
