{\an8}Bailey's Comet is coming again?

165
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:35,502
Guys!

166
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:37,837
- When?
- Not for two years, Mr. Jones.

167
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,047
{\an8}But it's an extremely expensive telescope.

168
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:43,634
{\an8}It will be the only opportunity
we'll have to see the comet.

169
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:44,844
{\an8}We mustn't miss it.

{\an8}Walk? Do I look like
the kind of girl who walks home?

173

Ready, Ronnie?

174
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:58,815
{\an8}Thanks for the offer, Archie,
but I've secured an escort home.

{\an8}Um, excuse me?

00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:04,571
{\an8}How do you expect me to get home?

177
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:06,281
You got two feet, don't you?

178
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:08,324
Use them or lose them.

{\an8}I'm sorry, Miss Topaz.

{\an8}Miss Cooper.

181
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:28,843
{\an8}But I gave your article to Dr. Werthers
for review, and we both agree.

182
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:31,053
It's not suitable for publication.

183
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:36,517
Toni's reporting is thorough, insightful.

184
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:37,727
Balanced.

185
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,312
[WERTHERS] Be that as it may,

186
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:43,274
as a child psychologist,
it's my expert opinion

187
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:46,860
that the details of the Emmett Till case
are far too violent

188
00:10:46,943 --> 00:10:50,780
and disturbing for young,
impressionable minds.

189
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:54,743
People, your students,
need to understand the gravity

190
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:57,913
of what happened
so it doesn't happen again... here.

191
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:01,999
These sorts of things
don't happen in Riverdale.

192
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,755
May I remind you we were one of the first
high schools in the country to integrate.

193
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:09,757
Isn't that enough?

194
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,674
Hardly.

195
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:13,385
We don't have any Black teachers.

196
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:16,347
We don't study
or learn about Black authors.

197
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,556
Change doesn't happen overnight.

198
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:22,143
Your article is very well-written.

199
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:25,063
Surely you can find
some satisfaction in that.

200
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:32,779
Mom, Dad. You haven't said anything.

201
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,364
Did you read the article
my friend Toni wrote?

202
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:39,201
Yes, we did, honey.

203
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:44,790
And?

204
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,961
And it was very well-written.

205
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:50,837
Extremely well-written.

206
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:53,839
- Mm.
- So you'll read it on the air, Dad?

207
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:59,220
Geez, hon, we only get
15 minutes of airtime a night.

208
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:04,934
Do we really need to spend
one minute on a story that...

209
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:07,937
well, has nothing to do with us?

210
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,147
Dad, everyone watches
your nightly broadcast.

00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,775
Imagine the impact it would have if you,

212
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,444
the face of RIVW,
talked about Emmett Till.

213

Elizabeth. It's not that simple, honey.

214
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:24,035
You know that we have
to run every single one of our stories

215
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,203
past our sponsors for approval,

216
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,956
and, I'm sorry,
this is just not in their bailiwick.

217
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,750
Your sponsors?
You're talking about the Blossoms.

218
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,837
- Blossom Maple Syrup.
- If we lose their support,

219
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,882
RIVW won't be able
to expand its programming.

220
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,593
You won't be able to give
yourself a raise, you mean.

Betty, darling.

222
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:46,764
Why is this so important to you?

223
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:51,436
Because what happened to Emmett Till
was a complete injustice.

224
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,898
A crime emblematic of everything
that's wrong with this country,

225
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:59,485
and nobody except my friend Toni
and her friends seem to care about it.

226
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:07,868
You know, this might sound crazy, Jug.
The first time that I saw her,

227
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:11,038
it felt like I was hit by a thunderbolt
or something.

228

an extinction-level event.

At the moment of impact,

I used what was left of my life-force
to send everyone back to the past.

the necessary runway

isn't destroyed by Bailey's Comet.

Is that even possible?

691
00:38:07,737 --> 00:38:08,988
Hopefully.

692
00:38:10,114 --> 00:38:12,241
But if it is, I have to do it alone.

to paraphrase one of my heroes,

00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:32,926
that the moral arc of this universe
bends towards justice.

699
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,346
That way, when I finally do
untangle the various timelines,

700
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,807
we can make it back to a Riverdale

704
00:38:49,776 --> 00:38:51,611

Yes.
