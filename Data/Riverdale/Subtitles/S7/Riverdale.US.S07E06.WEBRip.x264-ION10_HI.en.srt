the comic book that you just published
is, beat for beat,

10
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:31,976

published ten years ago.

Basketball was something
Dad and I did together.

Whenever I walk into a gym
or pick up a ball...

562

I think about Dad, and suddenly
it's like there's an anvil on my heart.

And if I played,
I just know all I'd be thinking
