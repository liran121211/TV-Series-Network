I'm not one of those things.</i>

Gosh. Ethel, that's a beautiful sketch.
Is that for art class?

23
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:17,256
She's finishing up the sign-up sheet
for Miss Riverdale Teen Queen pageant.

24
00:01:17,339 --> 00:01:19,717
Your mom asked me to be her assistant.

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,886
Mm. Is it really time
for that embarrassing cattle call again?

26
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:24,345
Yes, it is.

27
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:28,015
But this year, first time ever,
we're going to be broadcast live

28
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:31,810
on national television
right out of the RIVW studios.

29
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:34,937
Whoop-de-do.
I hope you don't expect me to compete.

30
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:36,147
Oh, no, of course not.

31
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,192
Why would you wanna participate
in anything so glorious and wholesome

32
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:43,069
and all-American
as Miss Riverdale Teen Queen

33
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:46,280
when you're already holding the crown
for Miss Grumpy Pants U.S.A.?

34
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:50,575
And I'm sure you're not interested
in any of our wonderful prizes this year.

35
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:54,828
- Like, say, a new car.
- I don't have a driver's license.

36
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:58,123
- A Hollywood screen test.
- Not interested in the slightest.

37
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,875
Or a scholarship
to whatever college accepts you.

38
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:05,754
The pageant's giving away scholarships?
Since when?

39
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:08,215
Since we're gonna be live
on national television.

40
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:12,676
But I understand, you're not interested.
Ethel, she is beautiful.

41
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,054
But why don't we change her
from a blond to a brunette?

42
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,972
She'd be much more likable that way.

[SCHOOL BELL RINGING]

44
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,855
What do rules say about outside designers?

45
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,525
Edith Head has been dying
to design a bathing suit for me,

46
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:34,860
and Miss Riverdale Teen Queen
would be a divine showcase for it.

47
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:37,905
Oh, Vee, please tell me
you're not signing up for that.

48
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:38,906
I already did, Betty.

49
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:42,659
Imagine the publicity it'd bring
to the Babylonium if I won.

50
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:46,286
- It's a business decision.
- But it objectifies girls.

51
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:50,206
I mean, wearing a swimsuit and heels
at the same time?

52
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:53,501
What about that peep show you did
with Archie? Was that objectifying?

53
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:56,962
Yes. Well, that was between me and Archie.
And he was in his underwear too.

54
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:58,129
What I wouldn't give.

55
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:00,506
How about flashing your panties
on live television?

56
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:02,883
That was my decision, on my terms.

57
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:07,220
Look, beauty pageants can certainly
be seen as objectifying women

58
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:11,014
if you choose to look at them
solely through that one lens.

59
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,101
What other lens is there?

60
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:17,395
What's that saying?
"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"?

61
00:03:17,478 --> 00:03:19,772
Speaking for myself,
I love being beautiful.

62
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:22,941
Not for the drooling approval
of some fuddy-duddy judges.

63
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:27,570
I refuse to give them any power over me.
I decide if I'm beautiful or not.

64
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:29,947
And I am, as are we all.

65
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:32,615
But doesn't it bother you

66
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:35,326
that beauty pageants
pit girls against girls?

67
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,121
There's a way around that.
We gals just need to make a pact.

68
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:41,331
No matter who wins, we all win.

69
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:43,833
And no catfighting or backbiting.

70
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:48,253
Except against Evelyn Evernever,
who was the first to sign up, annoyingly.

71
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:50,046
Toni, you're doing it too?

72
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,756
Trust me, Betty,
I feel the same way you do.

73
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,594
But this is the first year that
Miss Riverdale Teen Queen is integrated.

74
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,387
Even though there's not
a snowball's chance in hell

75
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,514
those stuffed-shirt judges
will give me the title,

76
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:06,977
I'll make sure I show the country
one Black woman competing for the crown.

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,353
And if I do win, don't worry.

78
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:12,565
I'll call out the Miss America pageant
for the fact that all its contestants

79
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:15,400
must be of good health in the white race.

80
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:19,904
My parents sponsor
Miss Riverdale Teen Queen, of course,

81
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:23,489
so it'd definitely raise a few eyebrows
if I didn't compete.

82
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,701
Though,
if I do win the title again this year,

83
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:29,161
I would use my platform differently.

84
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:32,748
Advocating for the more
disenfranchised teens in this town.

85
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:38,752
You sure you should be competing, Midge,
you know, in your delicate condition?

86
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:42,464
Won't you be wearing high heels for hours?
What if you trip?

87
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:46,091
You're the sweetest
for worrying about me, Fangs, but...

88
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:50,929
this might be the last time
I get to do anything like this.

89
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:52,263
Just...

90
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:55,432
dress up and be a 16-year-old girl.

91
00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:00,353
Compete for some silly tiara
like it's the only thing that matters.

92
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,731
What I said before, ice it.

93
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:08,985
You go compete your heart out
on that stage, baby.

94
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:13,739
If those judges got eyes in their head,
they won't look at those other wannabes.

95
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:17,242
Because you're the hottest mama
with the classiest chassis

96
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:19,035
in the whole town, by a mile.

97
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:32,545
All right. Now that it's just us,
selfishly, of course I think it'd be a gas

98
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:35,465
if we were all part
of Miss Riverdale Teen Queen.

99
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:38,968
- So I'm gonna go out on a limb here...
- I think I know what you're going to say.

100
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:43,596
Let me ask you this, Betty.
If your mom wasn't hosting the pageant,

101
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:47,391
wouldn't you be competing
for those ginchy prizes?

102
00:05:47,474 --> 00:05:51,894
Imagine if you got that scholarship.
It could be your ticket to freedom.

103
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,814
You could go
to whatever school accepted you.

104
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:58,233
On your own terms,
not at your parents' whims.

105
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:03,570
- Someplace like...
- Sarah Florence or Smith College.

106
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:05,030
Mm-hm.

107
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,407
So you have thought about it.

108
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:09,450
I knew it.

The night I was crowned,

see glamorous places.

- What happened? Why didn't you do it?

Well, I married your father, of course.

{\an8}And then I had your sister,
and then I had you,

of becoming a stewardess.

- Yeah.

Yes, of course.

And mind you,
this is not just glitz and glam.

00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:16,327
- they'd be together right now.
- Quite the cautionary tale if you ask me.

327
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,580
No one is, you goon from Saskatoon.

328
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:22,916
I'm just... I'm wondering how Midge
could have ended up getting...

329
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:27,086
Uh...

330
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:31,882
No, I understand how it happened.
I'm just wondering if they were using...

331
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:35,010
If they were using protection.
Good question.

332
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:38,262
Midge said they were, but once it slipped.

333
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:41,682
- That's what Fangs told me too.
- See, this is why they ought to invent,

334
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:44,767
- I don't know, a pill or something.
- A what?

335
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:47,644
A pill.
Like a monthly pill that girls can take.

336
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:51,732
That protects them from... accidents.

337
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:52,773
Even happy ones.

338
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:54,233
Because let's face it,

339
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:58,278
we're the ones who have to live
with the consequences, not the boys.

340
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:00,947
They get claps on the back
while we bear the burden,

341
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:02,532
while we're stigmatized.

342
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:05,910
- Poor Midge. Her life is just...
- [CHERYL] Her life is not ruined.

343
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:08,494
Midge is one of my Vixens.
I won't let this destroy her.

344
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:10,788
Except you're no longer a Vixen,
and neither is Midge.

345
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:14,207
- Who did let you sit with us?
- I wonder if Fangs knows about this.

346
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,544
If he doesn't now, he will soon.
The whole school will.

347
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:21,005
- Then I should find him, talk to him.
- I'll come with you.

348
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:25,133
Betty, what are you thinking about?

349
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:29,595
Just how quickly
your entire life can change.

350
00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:32,890
How one night
can decide everything for you.

351
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,229
You were quiet in the lounge, Ethel.

352
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:46,442
I keep thinking about Midge
at the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

353
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:50,862
It's awful what's happening to Midge.
We will figure out a way to help her.

354
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:52,781
But in the meantime...

355
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:56,659
I also think this presents an opportunity.

356
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:59,453
- What do you mean?
- There's an open spot now

357
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:05,666
to replace Midge in the pageant,
and what better girl to do it than you?

358
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,211
- Do you really think that, Betty?
- I do.

359
00:20:09,294 --> 00:20:13,631
It almost feels like your destiny now,
but only if you want to, Ethel.

360
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:17,509
I do. But what about your mom?

361
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,719
There's so much that needs to get done,
and she still needs an assistant...

362
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,472
I have someone in mind for that.

363
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:28,226
They took Midge?
I'm gonna go out there to that convent,

364
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:31,353
I'm gonna bust Midge out of there.
She doesn't belong in that place.

365
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:34,731
They do experiments on those kids,
give them psychedelic drugs and stuff.

366
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:37,817
The last thing anyone needs
is you going in half-cocked.

367
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,403
Kidnapping Midge
after she's already been kidnapped once

368
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:42,028
will only make things worse.

369
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:43,822
We need more information.

370
00:20:43,905 --> 00:20:47,366
Midge's parents know she's pregnant
because Mrs. Cooper forced it out of her,

371
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,284
but they may not know
that you're the father.

372
00:20:49,368 --> 00:20:52,495
We should endeavor to keep it that way
so you're not arrested.

373
00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:54,747
- Or worse.
- What am I supposed to do? Huh?

374
00:20:55,415 --> 00:20:57,833
- Bupkis?
- We stick with the original plan.

375
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,876
You write a hit song,
you get a gold record,

376
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,420
and you become undeniable
to Midge's parents.

377
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:06,007
Focus on getting ready
for when you and Midge get reunited.

378
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,426
Look, my parents have made
many charitable donations to the Sisters,

379
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:14,763
so I will work on setting up at least
a phone call between you and dear Midge.

380
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:19,100
But you have to listen to Toni.
And, Fangs, remain calm.

381
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:22,020
Calm. [SNAPS FINGERS] Okay.

382
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,356
Beautiful.

383
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:31,777
What's going on in here?

384
00:21:31,861 --> 00:21:36,197
I'm just getting Ethel all caught up,
but she has perfect poise, honestly.

385
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:40,034
- And doesn't she look to die for?
- Getting caught up on what, exactly?

386
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:43,619
Oh, didn't you hear?
Ethel's replacing Midge in the pageant.

387
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:47,915
- And she already knows all the routines.
- That is wonderful.

388
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,168
Um, but who's gonna be my assistant?

389
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:54,336
Here's your java, Mrs. Cooper.
Just the way Betty said you liked it.

390
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,172
Three sugars, extra cream.

391
00:21:57,048 --> 00:21:59,257
Can I speak to you in the hallway?

392
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,675
Sure, Mom.

393
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:06,055
A few more laps and then we'll brainstorm
some ideas for the talent competition.

394
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:13,436
I knew you were gonna try to undermine me.

395
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,312
How am I trying to undermine you?

396
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:16,813
Midge dropped out,

397
00:22:16,897 --> 00:22:20,274
or more likely was forced out by you.

398
00:22:20,357 --> 00:22:22,818
- Now, what's wrong with Ethel competing?
- What's wrong?

399
00:22:22,902 --> 00:22:27,113
Ethel does not represent the ideals
of Miss Riverdale Teen Queen.

400
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:29,407
- Not by a country mile.
- Why? She's not pregnant.

401
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:32,701
No. No, she's not,
but she has an unsavory history.

402
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:36,913
Are you talking about what happened
with her parents, or something else?

403
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,624
Whoa. You are awful.

404
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:44,002
I am here to protect the office
of Miss Riverdale Teen Queen.

405
00:22:44,085 --> 00:22:47,254
I am not gonna let you turn this
competition into one of your crusades.

406
00:22:47,338 --> 00:22:49,298
And whether you believe me or not,

407
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:52,717
I am also
and especially trying to protect Ethel

408
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:56,345
from the scrutiny
that Miss Riverdale Teen Queen demands.

409
00:22:56,428 --> 00:22:59,598
I'm sorry, but over my dead body
is she going to compete.

410
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:03,684
Mom, Ethel should be
Miss Riverdale Teen Queen.

411
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:07,103
She needs and deserves it
more than the rest of us.

412
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:09,397
Think about it for one second, okay?

413
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:13,359
Ethel is an orphan. This scholarship
may be her only chance to go to college.

414
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:14,777
- No!
- Mom.

415
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,611
That is final. Ethel is a lovely girl,

416
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:18,988
but this is not a charity,
it's a competition.

417
00:23:19,072 --> 00:23:20,865
And since you made this mess,

418
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:25,077
you're the one that's gonna tell her
that she has to withdraw, not me!

419
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,497
[TONI] <i>What's the trouble now?</i>

420
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,624
Well, I got Ethel
to sign up for the pageant,

421
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:34,918
and no surprise, my mom blew a gasket.

422
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,753
She's not letting Ethel compete
in Miss Riverdale Teen Queen.

423
00:23:37,837 --> 00:23:40,089
- Even though there's an empty slot.
- Oh, dear.

424
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:43,383
And why doesn't she want Ethel
to drop a nickel and then participate?

425
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:44,843
It's more of the same.

426
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:48,846
Ethel doesn't represent
the ideal blah-blah-blah.

427
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,932
My mom is nuttier than
a Christmas fruitcake, but I'm in it now.

428
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,600
And I don't wanna be the one
to tell Ethel that she doesn't...

429
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,061
represent the very best of Riverdale.

430
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:00,397
Imagine what winning would do for her.

431
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,399
Imagine the doors it would open.

432
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:05,192
Not just in high school,
but for the rest of her life.

433
00:24:05,276 --> 00:24:07,903
Honestly, Ethel's got
as much chance of winning as I do,

434
00:24:07,986 --> 00:24:09,821
but we're with you, Betty.

435
00:24:10,488 --> 00:24:11,906
What should we do?

436
00:24:12,657 --> 00:24:14,283
I'm open to ideas, ladies.

437
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:19,495
I vote we stand together, link arms,
and demand Ethel gets a chance to compete

438
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:20,788
or we all withdraw.

439
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,207
Quote it. I'm in, sisters.

440
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,750
This pageant's nowheresville without us.

441
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:26,668
Okay.

442
00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:30,379
- I'll go talk to my mom.
- [VERONICA] Hold the line.

443
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:31,797
Thinking it through,

444
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:35,383
maybe this is one of those times
you go around your mom

445
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,804
to someone who might be more inclined
to listen to reason... or threats.

446
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,933
- Someone like my dad?
- Exactly.

447
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,853
And maybe
you shouldn't go in alone, either.

448
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:52,272
Maybe you go
with a more seasoned negotiator

449
00:24:52,981 --> 00:24:56,567
who won't get bogged down
in messy, sticky family dynamics.

450
00:24:58,277 --> 00:24:59,528
Like <i>moi.</i>

451
00:25:05,657 --> 00:25:06,700
[BETTY] Ready?

452
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:10,119
- [VERONICA] Mr. Cooper.
- Hi, Dad.

453
00:25:10,202 --> 00:25:11,913
Hey, ladies, what's the good word?

454
00:25:11,996 --> 00:25:16,750
May we bend your ear about a few,
let's call them competition parameters,

455
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:19,920
that we and our fellow pageant contestants
have been discussing?

456
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:21,712
And what would those parameters be?

457
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:25,715
The first being Ethel Muggs
must be allowed to participate.

458
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:28,134
Let me just stop you girls right there.

459
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:31,595
I've already gotten an earful
about this from Mrs. Cooper.

460
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:35,474
And I'm afraid
that there is just no wiggle room.

461
00:25:35,557 --> 00:25:37,558
- But...
- I'm sorry, girls, truly.

462
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:39,685
But there is a lot riding on this pageant.

463
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:44,564
And how we present ourselves to the world
is of the utmost importance, Veronica.

464
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:49,610
It's funny, Mr. Cooper, I've been doing
research on TV ad spending, for kicks,

465
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:53,112
including how much money
a live television event can bring in.

466
00:25:53,196 --> 00:25:57,574
Miss Riverdale Teen Queen is going to be
huge for RIVW, we all know that.

467
00:25:57,658 --> 00:25:58,992
We all want that.

468
00:25:59,076 --> 00:26:03,704
Also, we're guessing you've already sold
all your commercial spots, am I right?

469
00:26:03,788 --> 00:26:07,207
Which means you're on the hook,
and you can't cash those checks

470
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,460
unless Miss Riverdale Teen Queen
airs without a hitch.

471
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:12,962
What exactly are you two driving at?

472
00:26:13,045 --> 00:26:17,465
Only that you might find yourself
in a precarious position

473
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:21,928
if all your teen contestants suddenly
decided to pull out of the pageant.

474
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:25,639
Which we will, Dad, if you don't fix it
with Mom so that Ethel can compete.

475
00:26:25,722 --> 00:26:26,723
Betty, I...

476
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:29,850
[SIGHS]

477
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,645
Okay, fine. I'll see what I can do.

478
00:26:32,728 --> 00:26:35,271
Thank you, Mr. Cooper. That's fantabulous.

479
00:26:35,772 --> 00:26:36,690
And one more thing.

480
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:39,358
We want the swimsuit promenade
cut from the pageant.

481
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:43,070
What? Why?
That is the judges' favorite segment.

482
00:26:43,153 --> 00:26:43,987
I'm sure.

483
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:46,572
But frankly, there's just no justifying

484
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:50,158
that outdated and plainly sexist aspect
of the competition.

485
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,495
Especially considering
all our judges are men,

486
00:26:53,577 --> 00:26:56,580
and two of them are faculty members
at our school.

487
00:26:56,664 --> 00:26:58,707

Is everything okay?

660

Is this sour grapes
because Ethel won and I lost?

661
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:30,139
You think you know everything,
don't you, Betty? Open it.

662
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:46,736
Wait, Ethel didn't win?

663
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,653
That's right.

664
00:38:49,405 --> 00:38:53,992
Your father and the judges were furious
when I read her name instead of yours.

665
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:56,870
But what could they do?
They couldn't contradict me.

666
00:38:56,953 --> 00:39:00,455
It would have been an embarrassment
to them and the station.

You wanted Ethel to win after all?

Teen Queen can change lives.

Even a life
as broken and hopeless as Ethel's.

672
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:27,394
Or maybe I just didn't want you to win.
I guess you'll never know.

673
00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:29,812
But know this, Elizabeth.

674
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:35,775
Even with all your do-gooding
and grandstanding, Ethel would have lost.
