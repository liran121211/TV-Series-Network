1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,130
The year is 1955.

2
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:46,350
Number one on the Billboard
charts is "Rock Around The Clock,"

3
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,048
an earworm
if I've ever heard one.

4
00:00:49,614 --> 00:00:51,312
Now, some random fun facts.

5
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:53,792
In 1955, a hamburger
with a side of fries

6
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:55,751
set you back 30 cents.

7
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:59,755
A comic book, a dime.
A pulp novel, a quarter.

8
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:04,214
It's been two days since Bailey's
Comet almost decimated us,

9
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:07,502
and we were somehow
zapped back to the 1950s.

10
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:09,678
I'm not sure
how that happened exactly.

11
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:11,636
I'm not sure
if we're merely in the past,

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,508
or in the past
of an alternate universe.

13
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:16,771
But things are different
here in Riverdale.

14
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:20,297
For starters, I live in an
abandoned train car with Hot Dog,

15
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:23,387
which actually tracks.

16
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:26,347
And at Riverdale High,
we're all juniors again.

17
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,175
Betty and Kevin
aren't merely friends,

18
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:29,914
they're dating.

19
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,962
Cheryl's twin brother is alive,
but he's not Jason.

20
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:34,005
He's Julian.

21
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:37,662
No sign of a Reggie yet.

22
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:42,753
But Archie exists, and he's still
pretty much a teen Charles Atlas.

23
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:44,321
None of them remember our lives

24
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:45,975
from before
we became teenagers again,

25
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:48,108
and I haven't tried
to remind them yet.

26
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,458
I've been waiting to reconnect
with the one person

27
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,262
who might be able to shed light
on our predicament,

28
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:54,114
because she was
both chronokinetic

29
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:57,465
and the town's guardian angel,
my girlfriend, Tabitha Tate.

30
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:59,380
Bus from
Mississippi's pulling in.

31
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:03,340
Wonder if it was
as bad down there

32
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:05,212
as they're saying on the radio.

33
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:07,823
I already knew
what Pop would soon find out.

34
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:10,173
It was much, much worse.

35
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:13,742
Tabitha, Toni and some of Riverdale
High's other students of color

36
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:15,700
were in Mississippi
for the trial

37
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:18,616
of the two men who murdered
Black teenager Emmett Till,

38
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,880
for supposedly whistling
at a white woman.

39
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:24,144
The jury deliberated
for all of 67 minutes

40
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,276
and then acquitted the killers.

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,103
It was one of
the single most shameful

42
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,281
and appalling events
of this or any era.

43
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:38,767
Uh, Tabitha?

44
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:44,293
Uh, they

45
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:46,296
announced the verdict
on... on the radio.

46
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,081
It made me sick in my stomach.

47
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:53,781
- If you need anything...
- That's what we're trying to figure out now,

48
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:58,308
what our next move should be...
but I appreciate the offer.

49
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:03,226
It's Jughead, right?

50
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,532
Uh, yeah. Yes.

51
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,752
I'll let you know.

52
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:14,237
It's overwhelming.

53
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:17,458
Heartbreaking.

54
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,242
Whichever genius
said that the '50s

55
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:20,896
were the greatest decade
of all time

56
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,637
should seriously
have their head examined.

57
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,815
Archie? Can I
speak to you for a minute?

58
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:36,390
What's wrong, Mom?

59
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:40,002
They printed more pictures
from James Dean's car accident.

60
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,327
Oh, I can't even
show them to you.

61
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,807
You shouldn't
look at that stuff, Mom,

62
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,659
- it upsets you.
- No, what upsets me

63
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:47,792
-is the idea of you on the road being reckless.
- Oh.

64
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:49,838
And that's why I...

65
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:52,144
I'm going to need
your keys, Archie.

66
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:54,190
You're not going to drive
that hot rod anymore.

67
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,975
Mom. Whoa!
Now, Mom, I'm a safe driver.

68
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:58,325
It's not a hot rod.

69
00:03:58,368 --> 00:03:59,761
It's barely
a cut above a jalopy...

70
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:02,024
It's got fire painted
on its doors.

71
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,374
- Mom.
- Keys. Now.

What do you think, Betty?

83
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:57,079
Toni, your writing
is remarkable.

84
00:04:57,122 --> 00:05:02,258
This is the most important piece of
reporting that I've read in my two years

85
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,912
as editor-in-chief
at the Blue and Gold.

86
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:06,784
But we've tried covering
Emmett Till before.

87
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:11,049
Both times Principal Featherhead
has vetoed the stories.

88
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:16,054
Betty, I heard Mamie Till give the
most incredible, inspiring speech

89
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:18,753
after the verdict was delivered.

90
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:20,276
And I got a chance
to interview people

91
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,191
that knew Emmett personally,

92
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:25,934
his friends, his neighbors.

93
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:28,153
And I made them a promise I
would help tell his story.

94
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:31,896
I agree wholeheartedly.

95
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:36,036
I'll make an appointment
for us with Featherhead.

96
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:40,034
This is a squirrel mill.

97
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:42,777
A mill is a hot rod or souped-up
jalopy which was once just a car.

98
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:46,215
Well, it should happen to all...

99
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:48,739
Mrs. Thornton, I'm sorry
to interrupt your class,

100
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:53,875
but I did want to personally introduce a
new student to our Riverdale High family.

101
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,573
She's just moved here
from sunny Los Angeles.

102
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:12,676
Damn.

103
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,635
Even in 1955,
Veronica Lodge knew

104
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:16,158
how to make an entrance.

105
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:18,421
Enchante, I'm sure.

106
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:20,423
Thank you,
Principal Featherhead.

107
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,033
Now, before you ask,

108
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:24,775
yes, I am that Veronica Lodge,

109
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,648
the daughter
of Hiram and Hermione Lodge,

110
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:32,261
the married stars of America's number-one
rated television program, Oh Mija!

111
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:33,828
For the foreseeable future,

112
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:35,960
I will be staying
with my auntie and uncle

113
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:37,745
at the Pembrooke
in downtown Riverdale.

114
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,748
Why? Well,

115
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,926
you may have heard about MGM's
upcoming film adaptation of Our Town.

116
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:49,757
Though I can't confirm that the lead
role of innocent ingenue Emily Webb

117
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,498
has already been cast

118
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,326
with a certain raven-haired
starlet, namely moi,

119
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,112
I did feel
it was an opportune time

120
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:59,027
to take a sabbatical
from Hollywood

121
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,423
and get a feel
for small-town life.

122
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,816
But please, I beg of you
treat me as one of your own,

123
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,819
not as a scion
of Tinseltown royalty.

124
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,649
Thank you.

125
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,370
Mind if I join you?

126
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:39,763
- Actually...
- Yeah, sure.

127
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:43,637
I believe I caught on your names

128
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,682
in Mrs. Thornton's class.

129
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:47,945
Archie. Betty.

130
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:49,947
Kevin. Julian.

131
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,256
Hmm.

132
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:55,499
Remind me, what's yours again?

133
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,303
- Cheryl.
- That's right, Cheryl.

134
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,742
So, what are we dishing about?

135
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:05,049
- Clue me in.
- James Dean's untimely passing, of course.

136
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:07,443
I am the president of his fan
club here at Riverdale High.

137
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,793
Your parents' show is hilarious.

138
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,403
We tune in every week.

139
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,709
You and everyone else,

140
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:14,581
if Mr. Nielsen
is to be believed.

141
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:16,191
Where in Los Angeles
did you live?

142
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,801
Bel Air.

143
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,195
In a ghastly old mansion
Vincent Price used to own.

144
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:22,327
Is that close to
where James Dean lived?

145
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,286
Wait, you didn't know
James Dean, did you?

146
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,766
Kevin, don't be so provincial.

147
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,594
James Dean was a movie star.

148
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,987
He was friends with Elizabeth
Taylor and Rock Hudson.

149
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,250
Actually, Jimmy
and I were quite friendly.

150
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:34,614
We went skinny-dipping in the
pool at the Chateau Marmaduke.

151
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,171
- You went skinny-dipping?
- With James Dean?

152
00:08:40,215 --> 00:08:41,869
Once or was it a regular thing?

153
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:44,567
I suppose next you'll be saying
you and Jimmy dated.

154
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:48,266
No, but he did enjoy playing
both sides of the net.

155
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,660
Girls and boys.

156
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:55,143
Wait. Hang on! Are you
suggesting that James Dean was...

157
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:56,665
What? I mean,
he seemed like

158
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,103
such a regular guy.
Like a cowboy, almost.

159
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:01,584
How dare you besmirch
his memory like that?

160
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,499
Don't you be so provincial.

161
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,849
I don't know why I'm so surprised
to hear such filthy lies

162
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,982
coming out of the mouth
of some wild child

163
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,345
who grew up
surrounded by perverts

164
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:12,290
going to sex parties and orgies!

165
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,989
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have lost my appetite.

166
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:20,342
What about Sal Mineo?

167
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,715
Remember, the astronomy club
is meeting after school today.

168
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,064
We will be bringing
something ideas to fundraise

169
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,326
so we can purchase new telescope

170
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,550
before Bailey's Comet arrives.

171
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,572
B-Bailey's Comet
is coming again?

172
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,400
Guys!

173
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:36,750
When?

174
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,273
Oh, not for
two years, Mr. Jones.

175
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:39,903
But it's an extremely
expensive telescope,

176
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:41,537
and this will be
the only opportunity

177
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,713
we'll have to see
the comet in our lifetime.

178
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:44,757
We mustn't miss it.

179
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:49,501
Hey, Veronica,
can I walk you home?

180
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,808
Walk?

181
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,810
Do I look like the kind of girl
who walks home?

182
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:54,898
Ready, Ronnie?

183
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:56,900
Thanks for the offer, Archie,

184
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:59,104
but as you can see, I've
already secured an escort home.

185
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:02,384
Um, excuse me.

186
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,734
And how do you expect me
to get home, dear brother?

187
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:05,898
You got two feet, don't you?

188
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,041
Use them or lose them.

189
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,229
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:24,624
Miss Topaz, Miss Cooper,

191
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,887
but I gave your article
to Dr. Werthers for review,

192
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,845
and we both agree,

193
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,674
it's not suitable
for publication.

194
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:37,767
Toni's reporting is, it's
thorough, insightful, balanced.

195
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:42,076
Be that as it may,
as a child psychologist,

196
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:45,427
it's my expert opinion that the
details of the Emmett Till case

197
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,038
are far too violent
and disturbing

198
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:50,737
for young, impressionable minds.

199
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,262
People, your students,
need to understand

200
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,545
the gravity of what happens
so it doesn't happen again...

201
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:58,919
here.

202
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:01,791
These sorts of things
don't happen in Riverdale.

203
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:05,142
And may I remind you
that we were

204
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,579
one of the first high schools
in the country to integrate.

205
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:11,235
- Isn't that enough?
- Hardly.

206
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,455
We don't have
any Black teachers.

207
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:16,153
We don't study or learn
about Black authors.

208
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:19,548
Change doesn't
happen overnight, Miss Topaz.

209
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:22,769
Your article's
very well-written.

210
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,771
Surely you can find
some satisfaction in that.

211
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:33,344
Mom, Dad,
you haven't said anything.

212
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,477
Did you read the article
my friend Toni wrote?

213
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,089
Yes, we did, honey.

214
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,790
And?

215
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:49,534
And it was very well-written.

216
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:51,536
- Extremely well-written.
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,900
So you'll read it
on the air, Dad?

218
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:59,588
Jeez, hon, we only get
15 minutes of airtime a night.

219
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:05,159
Do we really need to spend
one minute on a story that...

220
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:07,814
well, has nothing to do with us?

221
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:10,773
Dad, everyone watches
your nightly broadcast.

222
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,993
Imagine the impact it would have

223
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:16,431
if you, the face of RIVW,
talked about Emmett Till.

224
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:20,304
Elizabeth,
it's not that simple, honey.

225
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:22,567
I mean, you know very well
that we have to run

226
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:24,134
every single one of our stories

227
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,267
past our sponsors for approval.

228
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,574
And I'm sorry, this is just
not in their bailiwick.

229
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:30,900
Your sponsors,
you're talking about

230
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:33,143
The Blossoms,
Blossom Maple Syrup.

231
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,797
But if we lose their support,

232
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:38,801
RIVW won't be able
to expand its programming.

233
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:42,631
Hmm. You won't be able to give
yourself a raise, you mean.

234
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:46,940
Betty. Darling, why
is this so important to you?

235
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:51,596
Because what happened to Emmett
Till was a complete injustice.

236
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,555
A crime emblematic of everything

237
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,862
that's wrong with this country.

238
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:57,515
And nobody except my friend Toni

239
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,169
and her friends
seem to care about it.

240
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,523
You know,
this might sound crazy, Jug.

241
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,004
The first time that I saw her,

242
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,702
I felt like I was hit
by a thunderbolt or something.

243
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:13,227
Shazam!

244
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,359
But how is a guy like me
going to get anywhere

245
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:17,763
with a girl like Veronica Lodge
if I'm riding a damn bicycle?

246
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:22,149
That's why I'm sneaking
this baby out tonight.

247
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,368
I admit, while Archie
poured his heart out to me,

248
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:26,283
I was racking my brains.

249
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:28,590
If Bailey's Comet was what
sent us all to the past,

250
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:30,984
Bailey's Comet might be able
to send us back to the future.

251
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:32,681
But I needed help.

252
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:34,441
But with my friends
unaware of their former lives,

253
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:36,990
how can I make them remember?

254
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,403
It would take some kind of tangible
proof to jolt them awake, but what?

255
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:42,299
Jug, have you seen my dad's hammer?
I need to smack this dent out.

256
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:43,953
Your dad's hammer?

257
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,912
Did everyone bring an item?

258
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:49,611
Putting in a guitar pick and a
hammer from my dad's toolbox.

259
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:52,701
It was a long shot.

260
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:54,268
But could that
time capsule we buried

261
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,096
graduation weekend,
possibly have survived

262
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,881
whatever cosmic event
sent us back to 1955?

263
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:01,710
The items in that capsule
might trigger their memories.

264
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:03,353
Do you have a shovel
that I could borrow?

265
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:31,782
Thank God!

266
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:54,197
Well, well, well.

267
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:55,938
Color me curious.

268
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:58,332
The all-American boy
is secretly a hot-rodder.

269
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,495
I was hoping I could maybe
give you a ride home today.

270
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,250
Consider it a date.

271
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:05,208
Archie. Veronica.

272
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,492
I'm holding an emergency meeting
in the music room. Hurry!

273
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:10,300
Who is that person again?

274
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,353
What is all this junk, Jughead?

275
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:22,008
These headlines
are like Dr. Seuss.

276
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:23,931
Just take a moment.
Look at what you're holding.

277
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:30,059
Do you remember anything?
Do you... Do you feel anything?

278
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:33,671
I mean, I like the jacket, but I've
never seen this before in my life.

279
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,673
I've been to
a lot of movie sets,

280
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:39,590
so I know a good prop when I
see one, and these are okay.

281
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,941
- They're not props.
- Hedwig and the Angry Inch.

282
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,377
I don't get it.
An "inch" of what?

283
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,682
When did you even get a chance

284
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,554
to bury my dad's
hammer in a cooler?

285
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,338
I didn't. You did.

286
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:51,776
We all buried something
of emotional significance

287
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,693
in that time capsule
67 years ago.

288
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:58,000
- But in the future.
- The future?

289
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:00,437
Yeah. Yes.

290
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:01,917
This is gonna sound nuts, okay?

291
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,353
Just hear me out.

292
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,312
Thanks to a cataclysmic event,

293
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:08,402
all of us, we were all
sent back in time...

294
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,493
to maybe
an alternate parallel universe.

295
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:20,153
And we need to get back
to our future.

296
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:22,764
Our present. I...
I was hoping that by showing

297
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:25,549
you guys these objects,
it would help jog your memory.

298
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:27,421
Okay. What's your object?
What did you bury?

299
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,118
It was a yarn beanie.

300
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:31,338
But for whatever reason,
it wasn't in the time capsule.

301
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:32,381
Oh.

302
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:35,429
All right. I'll play along.

303
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:37,126
Yeah. Okay.

304
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,476
In the future,
who's more famous?

305
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,825
Me or Elizabeth Taylor?

306
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,189
Never mind her.
She just got here.

307
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:43,785
Bird's-eye view.
What's the future like?

308
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:45,742
Um...

309
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:47,963
Where do I start? Uh...

310
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:50,879
Okay.

311
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,968
We don't use
regular phones anymore.

312
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,622
We use something
called smartphones,

313
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:56,928
which we can carry around
everywhere with us.

314
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:59,627
And, ironically, we don't
even call people on them.

315
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,109
We just send texts,
which are like messages

316
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:05,241
and listen to music on Spotify

317
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:06,851
and, oh, the Internet.

318
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,679
The Internet is like, um,

319
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:10,855
having an entire encyclopedia
at your fingertips.

320
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:12,161
Well, maybe tell us about us.

321
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:13,815
What were we like in the future?

322
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,470
Okay. Archie joins the Army
and fought in a war.

323
00:17:16,512 --> 00:17:18,646
Betty, you were in the FBI

324
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,909
and you were hunting down
serial killers,

325
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:23,520
which I guess is a term
that doesn't exist yet.

326
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,566
Veronica, you owned a casino.

327
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:27,089
But before that, a speakeasy,

328
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,570
which Toni bought
and turned into a biker bar.

329
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:35,184
Kevin, you directed,
uh, some musicals,

330
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:39,101
and were in
an organ-harvesting cult.

331
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,798
Huh! Oh!

332
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,887
Okay. What about me?

333
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:47,457
Uh, you were possessed by your
ancestor and... and became a witch.

334
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,199
Oh.

335
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:52,593
If that's what
we were doing in the future,

336
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,682
why would we want to go back?
We sound miserable.

337
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:56,858
Yeah, and how would
that even happen?

338
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,294
Okay, I...
I have an idea.

339
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:00,166
Now, it's a crazy one,
but it might work.

340
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:02,777
So, short of waiting
for Bailey's Comet to return,

341
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,737
the other way that we could break
through the space-time barrier

342
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,088
is by getting Archie and Betty

343
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:13,309
to make out
on top of Archie's bed,

344
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:16,269
and then we blow up
a bomb underneath them.

345
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:20,447
All right, Jug.
That's enough, man.

346
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,164
- Let's go for a walk.
- You're not going to beat me up, are you?

347
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:23,687
Because you're really
violent in the future.

348
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:25,365
What? No, we're gonna talk.

349
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,758
- Come on.
- Just... Just look at that.

350
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:30,848
- You don't understand!
- No, Jug, you don't understand.

351
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,589
We are not from the future.

352
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:35,462
Jughead, it's 1955.

353
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:36,961
And things are
hard enough to figure out

354
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,900
without your crazy stories

355
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:40,771
about time traveling

356
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:44,558
and other universes.
And setting off bombs?

357
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:47,430
I mean, for Pete's sake, Jughead.
If you're not careful,

358
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:50,554
people might start thinking you belong
in the loony bin with the other nutjobs.

359
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:52,217
You think I'm crazy?

360
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:55,482
No, I, uh...

361
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:58,746
I just, I think you have an
overactive imagination, is all.

362
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:01,792
And look,
you should keep writing

363
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,074
your comic books
and your stories

364
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:04,752
instead of trying to convince us

365
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,115
that we're trapped
in some kind of

366
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,147
science-fiction picture show.

367
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,410
Jug, life's good.

368
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:14,109
It's not perfect,
but... but what is?

369
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,720
Well, just trust me on this
one, will you, bud, please?

370
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:17,939
Yeah.

371
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:20,811
- Yeah, no...
- Yeah?

372
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:23,335
Attaboy.

373
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,343
I feel like all I'm doing lately

374
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,649
is apologizing to you, Toni.

375
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:35,435
But... my parents say
they wouldn't be able

376
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:37,480
to get your story
past The Blossoms,

377
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:40,179
and they sponsor
the nightly news, so...

378
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,572
Well, I'm not surprised.

379
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:45,140
When Emmett was murdered,
nobody wanted to talk about it

380
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,577
and nobody
wanted to hear about it.

381
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:51,538
It took Mrs. Till publishing
her son's funeral pictures

382
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:54,018
for people to finally wake up.

383
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:55,846
I don't think I know about that.

384
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,283
Before Emmett was buried,

385
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:59,328
his mother asked
for an open casket

386
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,635
so people could see
what was done to her son.

387
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:07,641
How he'd been beaten,
tortured and disfigured.

388
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:15,605
Toni, do you have copies
of those pictures?

389
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,217
At home.

390
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,740
From when they were
in a newsletter.

391
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,134
Are you sure
you want to see them?

392
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:37,540
Why on God's earth are you two
in such sullen, sulking moods?

393
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:39,412
It's not like you're poor.

394
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,675
Julian's mad because that
fake stuck-up Veronica Lodge

395
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:43,894
- ditched him for a date with Archie Andrews.
- -Mm.

396
00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:46,593
Cheryl's mad because suddenly
she's not the most beautiful,

397
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:49,030
most interesting girl
at Riverdale High anymore.

398
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:51,075
As if she ever was.

399
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,905
Anyway, these inane movie
magazines came in the mail for you.

400
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:56,385
Perhaps they'll cheer you up.

401
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,487
♪ Well, I saw my baby walking ♪

402
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:14,925
♪ With another man today... ♪

403
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,493
- They're good, right?
- Delicious.

404
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,756
Honestly, I think these
onion rings might be

405
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,367
better than the ones
at the Brown Derby.

406
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:25,109
Wow.
What's the Brown Derby?

407
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:28,939
It's a chain of restaurants that Gloria
Swanson's husband started in Los Angeles.

408
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:31,290
Who's Gloria Swanson?

409
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,511
You know what?
Let's skip it.

410
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:38,819
Enough Hollywood talk.
I want to hear about you.

411
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:41,300
Tell me everything there is
to know about Archie Andrews.

412
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:44,172
The hot-rodder next door.
What do you do for fun?

413
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:46,217
Well, I work on my car.

414
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:47,784
I like sports.

415
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:51,135
Um...
I come here to Pop's.

416
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,355
And I hang out
at Sweetwater River.

417
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:54,399
Yeah.

418
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,402
To skinny dip, I hope.

419
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,753
Mostly to fish.

420
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:01,798
My dad and I used
to go there together.

421
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,713
You used to?

422
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:05,715
Yeah, he's not around anymore.

423
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,718
He served in the Korean War
and he didn't make it back.

424
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:11,634
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
- No, it's okay.

425
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:12,809
It's okay.
You didn't know.

426
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:16,378
Anyway, it's just
me and my mom now.

427
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:19,250
And she works part-time
at the dress shop downtown.

428
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:22,210
Oh. Well, I will have
to pay her a visit.

429
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:23,813
I'll make sure
she gives you a discount.

430
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,477
What about girls?

431
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,785
I mean, as handsome as you are,

432
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:33,700
I assume you're beating
them off with a stick.

433
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:36,833
Uh...

434
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:40,707
Well, I'm probably digging myself
into a hole here, but, uh...

435
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,101
You know, I've never had a
serious girlfriend before.

436
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:46,451
Really?

437
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,932
Why's that?

438
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,216
I don't know. Maybe I just
haven't met the right girl yet.

439
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,155
Until now.

440
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:04,034
J'accuse!

441
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,079
Excuse me?

442
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:08,212
Cheryl, what is your problem?

443
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,823
She is my problem, Archie.

444
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:12,042
Veronica Lodge is nothing
but a liar and a fraud.

445
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:15,785
And I'm going to make sure
the entire world knows it.

446
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:17,613
You're not starring in Our Town.

447
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:20,137
Natalie Wood is.
It says so right there.

448
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:22,096
You've been lying to us
ever since you got here.

449
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:25,404
Which makes me wonder, why
are you actually in Riverdale?

450
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,362
Was it really your choice or

451
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,451
did your parents banish you
because they were fed up

452
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:32,236
with their lying liar
of a spoiled brat daughter?

453
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,637
Hey, it's...
It's okay.

454
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:44,118
That's just... It's sort of
what Cheryl's like.

455
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:45,859
But don't worry, no one
takes her seriously.

456
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,600
In this case,
she's right, though.

457
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:53,649
I haven't been entirely
honest with you guys.

458
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:57,436
The truth is,
my parents did banish me.

459
00:23:58,393 --> 00:23:59,873
Why would they do that?

460
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,963
Because I am a problem,

461
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:05,792
and when problems
interfere with their lives,

462
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:08,142
they make them go away.

463
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:11,145
In a way, it feels like
they've been

464
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:14,583
making me go away
since I was born.

465
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:16,803
Ignoring me and sidelining me

466
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:21,634
since they... started
that damn show of theirs.

467
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:25,072
So I began acting out

468
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:28,423
like some spoiled little rich
girl to get their attention.

469
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,644
And the straw that finally
broke the camel's back

470
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:36,257
and made my parents ship me
across the country was...

471
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:39,303
the accident.

472
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:41,828
With James Dean?
You were in the car?

473
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:47,181
No, I was part of a convoy
of some other good-time girls.

474
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:51,185
We were going to cheer Jimmy
on at a race in Salinas.

475
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:53,753
Anyway, to keep my
name out of the papers,

476
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:57,060
my parents spirited me away

477
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:59,236
and put me on a private
plane to Riverdale.

478
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,369
To live with your
aunt and uncle.

479
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:03,632
They don't exist, Archie.

480
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:06,766
This is my parent's place.

481
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:11,814
I can't... believe
they would do that.

482
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:15,165
I mean, exile you to live alone.

483
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:17,167
Like a fairy tale princess,
I guess.

484
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,521
The show is their
real baby, Archie. Not me.

485
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:34,096
Archie.

486
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:36,925
Mom.

487
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:41,844
- What are you doing up?
- Waiting for you.

488
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,934
I went into the garage
to get a screwdriver,

489
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:47,328
and I saw that you'd
taken your car out.

490
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:49,896
- Mom, I can explain.
- You're grounded, Archie.

491
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:55,118
Because I took my car out
without your permission?

492
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:58,034
Why is that all of a sudden
a criminal offense?

493
00:25:58,078 --> 00:26:00,210
The pictures of
James Dean's car crash.

494
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:07,130
I can't lose you...
like I lost your father.

495
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:14,181
And I can't get a call in
the middle of the night

496
00:26:14,224 --> 00:26:17,837
telling me that you wrapped your
car around some telephone pole.

497
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,752
Come on, Mom.
You won't.

498
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:21,841
You won't.

499
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:23,756
And I promise I won't speed.

500
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:26,193
I won't go drag racing.

501
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:29,283
In fact, I'll ask Betty
to un-soup my car

502
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:33,504
so that it doesn't
go faster than... than...

503
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:35,245
- Twenty-five miles an hour.
- Fifteen.

504
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:36,682
Twenty.

505
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:40,033
- Deal.
- Deal.

506
00:26:40,076 --> 00:26:41,817
- Twenty. Sounds great.
- Yeah. Okay.

507
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:55,483
Oh Mija! Starring Hiram
Lodge, Hermione Lodge

508
00:26:55,526 --> 00:26:57,920
and Tillie Temple
as Little Ronnie.

509
00:26:57,964 --> 00:26:59,313
Bitch.

510
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:08,148
Hello?

511
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:09,560
Veronica?
Veronica, can you hear me?

512
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:10,759
Mom?

513
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:13,109
Yes. Yes, I can.
How are you?

514
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:15,721
- Where are you?
- Listen, darling, I only have a minute.

515
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:19,202
But, um, what's this I'm hearing
about a boy at the apartment?

516
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:22,206
You know we didn't send you to Riverdale
to get into more trouble, Veronica.

517
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:24,599
Mom, please.
It was nothing.

518
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,514
He's just a friend from school.

519
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:30,083
Good, good.
That's music to my ears.

520
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:32,651
Mom, have you decided
on Thanksgiving yet?

521
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:35,175
- I can fly back.
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I have to go.

522
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:38,613
Your Uncle Orson just arrived.
But please, mija, fly right,

523
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,311
no boys, and we'll see
about the holidays.

524
00:27:41,355 --> 00:27:43,836
Talk soon. Kisses.

525
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:08,556
Thank you for letting me
borrow the newsletter, Toni.

526
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:13,213
I had no idea.

527
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:19,915
The pictures make it so
much more real, don't they?

528
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,917
Can you imagine
the strength and courage

529
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:24,354
it took Mrs. Till to let
them be published?

530
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:26,879
I truly can't.

531
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,840
But it did help me decide that

532
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:35,235
I'm going to publish your article in
the next edition of The Blue and Gold.

533
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:37,106
Consequences be damned.

534
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,413
I may have a different idea.

535
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:40,738
Nobody wanted
to see these pictures

536
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,112
and Featherhead and The Blossoms

537
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:46,202
don't want anybody
to read my article, fine.

538
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:48,770
But what about a poem
about Emmett Till

539
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,729
read during the
morning announcements?

540
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:54,123
- But Cheryl does the morning announcements.
- Exactly. Look,

541
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:58,780
I don't know her well, but she's going
to make up for her parents' cowardice.

542
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,477
You want to help me
with an ambush?

543
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,310
Hey, Jughead.

544
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,966
Tabitha. Hi.

545
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,534
You remember that offer
you made me before

546
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:15,928
to help out in any way
that you can?

547
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,539
Oh, yeah.
Yes, uh, of course.

548
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:23,152
Well, the NAACP asked Emmett Till's
mother to travel around the country

549
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:25,894
to speak about
what happened to her son,

550
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:29,419
and my folks are joining
the tour to pitch in.

551
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:35,164
I've decided that
I want to go with them.

552
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:39,429
After I help Toni
with a little something.

553
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:42,084
Wow.
That's incredible.

554
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:44,957
- They're going to let you drop out of school?
- No.

555
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,960
But I got special
permission from Featherhead.

556
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,439
I'll have my books with me,

557
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:51,920
but I would love to have
a friend help me

558
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,443
stay on top of everything.

559
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:55,881
Okay.
Yeah, I'll do it.

560
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:58,100
Thank you.

561
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,972
I so appreciate it.

562
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:02,235
- I'll be in touch, okay?
- Awesome.

563
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:04,628
I mean, um, swell.

564
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:13,724
Hey, Cheryl.

565
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:15,857
Can we talk to you for a second?

566
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:20,775
What can I do for you...
Toni, is it? And Betty.

567
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,866
Your family controls our RIVW,
which means they control

568
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,042
what Riverdale watches,

569
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:29,175
and Principal Featherhead

570
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:31,153
decides what I can and cannot
publish in the Blue and Gold.

571
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:33,396
The powers that be have
silenced my article

572
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,661
on Emmett Till's murder trial,
but you can fix this.

573
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:40,708
During the
morning announcements.

574
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:43,711
As junior class president,
I can't read an article

575
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:45,634
that Principal Featherhead
has already rejected.

576
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:48,324
Not an article.
Something else.

577
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:50,239
He'd pull the plug.
He's done it before.

578
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:52,459
We'll take care of Featherhead.

579
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:55,102
All you have to do is let us borrow
your soapbox for a few minutes.

580
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,205
What would I be reading?

581
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:08,170
Good morning, Miss Bell.

582
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:10,042
Are you ready for the
morning announcements?

583
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:12,305
Apparently, one of your
classmates, Tabatha Tate,

584
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:14,176
has passed out
on the football field.

585
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,613
Principal Featherhead
is tending to her now.

586
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:19,442
I'm to bring both him and
her some smelling salts.

587
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:21,140
Ugh, you don't say.

588
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:22,813
You know how to use a
microphone, don't you?

589
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:24,360
Indeed, I do.

590
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:26,101
Don't worry, Miss Bell.
All will be well.

591
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:27,928
Toodles.

592
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,461
Good morning, Riverdaleans.

593
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:42,465
In lieu of our usual morning
announcements, I, Cheryl Blossom,

594
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,424
will be turning over
my microphone

595
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:47,775
to one of our classmates,
Toni Topaz.

596
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:50,473
Please give her
your undivided attention.

597
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:58,873
Some of you may have heard what's
happening in Mississippi right now.

598
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,745
How a 14-year-old boy,
Emmett Till,

599
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:05,314
was murdered for maybe
whistling at a white woman

600
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:07,838
and how his killers
were just acquitted.

601
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:10,189
I wrote an article
about the trial,

602
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:14,541
and nobody wants you to read it
because it is "too upsetting."

603
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:18,414
So, instead, I'm going to read you a
poem that the great American writer

604
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:22,201
Langston Hughes wrote
about Emmett Till.

605
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:25,073
It's titled Mississippi-1955.

606
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:31,645
And I hope you hear his
words and reflect on them

607
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:33,386
and talk to each
other about them.

608
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:41,829
"Oh, what sorrow!
Oh, what pity!

609
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:44,614
Oh, what pain!

610
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:48,096
That tears and blood
Should mix like rain

611
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,403
And terror come again
To Mississippi.

612
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:52,971
Come again?

613
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,276
Where has terror been?

614
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:58,063
On vacation?
Up North?

615
00:32:58,106 --> 00:33:01,022
In some other section
Of the nation,

616
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:04,199
Lying low, unpublicized?

617
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,723
Masked-with only Jaundiced eyes

618
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:08,334
Showing through the mask?

619
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,643
Oh, what sorrow, Pity, pain,

620
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:17,038
That tears and blood
Should mix like rain

621
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:18,997
In Mississippi!

622
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,521
And terror, fetid hot,

623
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:24,176
Yet clammy cold remain."

624
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:31,444
I don't think any of the
students at Riverdale High

625
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:34,099
had ever heard a poem like that.

626
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:38,016
Hopefully, it was worth whatever
blowback the girls were certain to get.

627
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:42,281
The lies, the
insubordination, the trickery.

628
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:44,718
I did feel sick.

629
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:47,242
Then I felt better.

630
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:49,505
Surely you aren't saying
that we can't read poems

631
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,420
during the
morning announcements.

632
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:53,640
A poem written by one of
our greatest living authors.

633
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:57,557
All poems read during morning
announcements must be approved by me.

634
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,472
This is the first I've
heard of any such rule,

635
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:01,778
but I assure you,
moving forward,

636
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:04,129
all poems will be submitted
for your approval.

637
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:05,434
Cross my heart and hope to die.

638
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:13,051
I'm not sure what you ladies
think you've accomplished.

639
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,965
But something
had been accomplished.

640
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:18,969
Given recent events, it might
be fruitful for us to discuss

641
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:22,277
the poem Langston Hughes
wrote about Emmett Till.

642
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:29,371
How did it make you feel?

643
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,074
Angry.

644
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:41,514
Upset.

645
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,081
Hopeless.

646
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:48,347
Was he really just 14 years old?

647
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,350
He was.

648
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:54,918
He was younger than
all of us in this room.

649
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:57,269
Taken out of his home
in the middle of the night,

650
00:34:58,531 --> 00:35:01,621
beaten, tortured.

651
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:04,145
His body thrown into the river.

652
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:05,320
That's just wrong.

653
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:09,629
Miss Topaz,
Miss Tate, Mr. Walker,

654
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:12,806
I understand that you were
in Mississippi for the trial.

655
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:16,026
If you're comfortable
sharing your experience,

656
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,247
I believe it would be
valuable for the rest of us

657
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,815
to hear about what you saw.

658
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:22,946
Miss Topaz.

659
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,253
Would you like to start?

660
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:33,914
Fitfully, but also necessarily,

661
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:37,091
a conversation that might
not have happened for decades

662
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,398
began at Riverdale High
that afternoon.

663
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:47,710

What do you say?

668
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,547
You want a ride
to Pop's, Ronnie?

669
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:03,117
Hmm.

670
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,598
I see two paths before me.

671
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:09,297
Light and dark, fast and slow,

672
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:12,213
shallow and earnest.

673
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:15,477
But today...

674
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:18,698

676

677
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:33,452
Had I lost my mind?

678
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:36,150
Maybe 1955 wasn't the dream.
Maybe... Maybe the future,

679
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,586
maybe that was the dream,

680
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,109
and I finally woke up.

681
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:42,069
Hi, stranger.

682
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,288
Mind if I join you?

683
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:45,899
Yeah.

684
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,502
I thought...
I thought you were leaving.

685
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:52,949
I'm not the Tabitha from 1955.

686
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:56,344
She's with her parents
heading to Memphis.

687
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:58,955
- I'm...
- Riverdale's guardian angel.

688
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:01,349
The Tabitha who
remembers and loves you.

689
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:04,047
Oh, my God!

690
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:05,571
You need to use
your chronokinesis

691
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:07,703
and get us the hell
out of 1955.

692
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:11,229
Archie is trying to get me committed
to The Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

693
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:14,667
God, it's so...
I'm so happy to see you.

694
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,322
I am happy to see you too.

695
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:19,802
But I can't take us home.

696
00:37:21,064 --> 00:37:22,064
Not yet.

697
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:24,677
Why? Well, why not?

698
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,636
Our last-minute gambit
to stop Bailey's Comet

699
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,596
from destroying Riverdale
didn't work.

700
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:34,252
So the comet hit?

701
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:37,211
And it triggered
an extinction level event.

702
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:42,303
Are... Are we all dead?

703
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:45,001
Is that...
Is that what this is?

704
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:48,440
- The sweet hereafter?
- No, we are alive.

705
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:52,313
In the past, I had a plan B.

706
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:56,012
At the moment of impact, I used
what was left of my life-force

707
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:58,363
to send everyone back
to the past

708
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:01,235
to a point far enough back that
might give us the necessary runway

709
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,169
to make it back to the
present, a present in which

710
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:05,718
Riverdale isn't destroyed.
By Bailey's Comet.

711
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:07,720
Is that even possible?

712
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:08,938
Hopefully.

713
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,855
But if it is,
I have to do it alone.

714
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:15,423
By exploring and untangling
the various timelines

715
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:18,208
that became knotted and
entwined when the comet struck.

716
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:21,342
Well, what about the rest of us?

717
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:24,214
You all have to make a
go of it here in the '50s

718
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:25,955
by doing what you can to ensure,

719
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:28,523
to paraphrase one of my heroes,

720
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:33,049
that the moral arc of this
universe bends towards justice.

721
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:36,401
That way, when I finally do
untangle the various timelines,

722
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:38,968
we can make it
back to a Riverdale that

723
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:42,276
isn't on the verge of moral
and societal collapse.

724
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:46,324
But fair warning.

725
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,978
Given the near infinite number
of timelines and universes,

726
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:53,461
it could take a while, so
you better get comfortable.

727
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,507
Oh.

728
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,030
I mean, how...
How can I?

729
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:59,598
I remember everything
about our old lives?

730
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:02,296
You asking questions,
creating ripples...

731
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,518
that's what
drew me here.

732
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,172
Jughead.

733
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:11,958
You remembering is an anomaly,

734
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:14,613
a dangerous one
that I'm here to fix

735
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:17,180
by making you forget.

736
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:19,531
Otherwise, your knowledge
could drive you insane,

737
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:22,882
or it could drive you to do something
that further corrupts this timeline.

738
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:28,844
Will I...
I'll forget everything?

739
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:32,108
Yes.

740
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:35,634
You'd be just like everyone else,
able to live in the present.

741
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:37,723
In the moment.

742
00:39:41,596 --> 00:39:44,860
I don't... I mean, I don't want
to forget about you or about us.

743
00:39:45,774 --> 00:39:46,774
I know.

744
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:49,430
But you have to.

745
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:52,085
It's for the best.

746
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:53,146
In those first few seconds
after Angel Tabitha disappeared,

747
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:55,931
I could feel the effects
of her kiss taking hold.

748
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:58,238
But for the moment,
I still remembered.

749
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:00,370
I needed to write down
everything, our stories,

750
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:02,198
our lives,
before it was too late.

751
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:17,170
But then, like mist
evaporating in the sun,

752
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:18,867
it was all gone.

753
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:21,130
I had only managed
to get down three words.

754
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:23,829
Bend. Towards. Justice.

755
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:25,918
Meaning what, exactly?

756
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:28,007
And that wasn't even
the weirdest thing.

757
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,226
That would be the sudden,
inexplicable appearance

758
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,968
of something I've never
seen before.
