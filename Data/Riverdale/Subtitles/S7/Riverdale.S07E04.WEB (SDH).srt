[Jughead] <i>Things were dire.</i>

00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,274
<i>My friend Ethel's parents</i>

00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,376
<i>had been brutally murdered</i>
<i>the night of the sock hop.</i>

4
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:12,514
<i>And suddenly, Ethel and I</i>
<i>were the prime suspects.</i>

5
00:00:13,615 --> 00:00:14,549
You drew this picture,

6
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:16,551
didn't you, Ethel?

7
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:18,385
And they're meant to be
your mother and father.

8
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,121
Yes, but it was a joke.

9
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:27,261
Then why did Mr. Jones hide it
under his mattress
like a dirty secret?

10
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,931
And is this where your
far-fetched story

11
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:32,332
about a killer milkman
came from? A comic book?

12
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,402
No, no. I saw a milkman
leaving my house--

13
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,605
Don't say anything else,
not until we talk to a lawyer.

14
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:42,276
You know, a picture is worth
a thousand words, Mr. Jones.

15
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:47,080
And these... Well, these
tell a very disturbing story.

16
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,286
Well...

17
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,589
Well, maybe
they'll be more talkative
down at the station.

18
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:06,868
Jughead, what's happening?

19
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,036
They're railroading us.

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,604

Let's go, Jughead.

[students murmuring]

22
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:20,347
Where do you get off, Andrews,
taking advantage of my sister?

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,518
Going all the way with her
at Veronica's make-out party.

24
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:28,856
Okay, first of all,
you encouraged me
to date Cheryl.

25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,592
And second of all, I didn't.

26
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,995
We did not go all the way.

27
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:35,429
That's not what
Cheryl's saying.

28
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:42,804
[door slams]

29
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:46,440
Cheryl, why did you
tell your brother
we went all the way?

30
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,910
We didn't, we kissed.
That's all we did.

31
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,144
We did more than that, Archie.

32
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:54,348
I mean, Bela Lugosi didn't
give me this beauty mark.

33
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,185
Oh, okay, okay.
We barely made it
to second base.

34
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,254
So why tell Julian
we scored a homerun?

35
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:04,291
I can't explain it.

36
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,561
But by saying that we did,
it's helping me...

37
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,463
with a problem I'm having.

38
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,300
Just know that by
corroborating my story...

39
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:17,471
you'd be protecting me.

40
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,707
Protecting you?
How and from whom?

41
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,510
My family.

42
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,746
Archie, please don't ask me
any more questions than that.

43
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:30,417
Anyway, it's just
a little white lie, right?

44
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:35,222
Really, who is it hurting?

00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,265
I want to give this
back to you, Betty.

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,402
[Betty] That was fast.

49
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,072
Did you glean something
from it, at least?

50
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,205
I think so.

51
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,741
I think I know what you want.

52
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:56,978
And?

53
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,580
And I... I wanna wait
until marriage.

54
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:03,718
Oh, I see.

55
00:03:07,755 --> 00:03:08,756
Well, how about this?

56
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,026
I'm not okay with you

57
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,863
making all of the decisions
in this relationship, Kevin.

58
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:18,866
So, as far as I'm concerned,

59
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,668
we're not going steady anymore.

60
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,308
[sighs]

61
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,545
[Toni] <i>Betty, what is it?</i>
<i>Why are you crying?</i>

62
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,980
Kevin and I broke up.

63
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:36,450
[sighs] Boys ruin everything.

64
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:38,886
What did he do?

65
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,557
[sighs] Well, we were talking
about having a more
physical relationship.

66
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,694
And an ultimatum was put down.

67
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,464
You wanted to wait
till marriage?

68
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,403
No, Kevin said he wanted
to wait until marriage.

69
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,040
So I broke up with him.

70
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:02,375
Don't be ashamed
of your desires, Betty.

71
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,779
More girls should do
what you did.

72
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,849
Ask for what they want
from their supposed boyfriends.

73
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,552
What do I do now?

74
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:15,723
Well, how about you and I
go to the Dark Room

75
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:16,924
and grab a coffee?

76
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,425
And Betty...

77
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:22,697
maybe this breakup is exactly
what the doctor ordered.

78
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,936
[Veronica]
How's poor Ethel doing?

79
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,371
I think she's in shock.

80
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,575
I can only imagine.
What are they saying to you?

81
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:38,579
Not much. Just that they
can only hold us
legally for 24 hours.

82
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:41,916
After which, they either have
to release us or charge us.

83
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,117
But you were at the dance.

84
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:44,585
We were all there together.

85
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,587
If there was some way
that we could prove the time

86
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:50,525
that Ethel's parents
were killed, it might be
enough to clear me.

87
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:53,194
Then I'd figure out a way
to exonerate Ethel.

88

Putting on my Nora Charles hat,

89
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,266
doesn't Riverdale
have a coroner?

90
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,835
That would have performed
an autopsy on the Muggs?

91
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,435
Every town has a coroner.

92
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,938
But I don't know who that is.

93
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,338
Let me find out.

94
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,774
I'll be back.

95

Hey, Veronica... Nora Charles?

96
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,682
<i>The Thin Man</i>
is one of my favorite films.

97
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:16,751
I had a feeling.

98
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,460
Mom, what's wrong?

99
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,765
Mrs. Blossom just came by.

100
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,668
Is it true what she's saying
you and Cheryl did?

101
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,707
How did this happen?

102
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,777
Mom, I don't really
feel comfortable
discussing this with you.

103

You think I do?

00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:45,546
Never mind.

Just go upstairs
and change into your suit.

106
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:50,051
Why?

107
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,720
Because we're going over
to the Blossoms' for dinner,

108
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:57,490
to figure out a path
through this mess
that you and Cheryl made.

Oh, Mary, please.
It's Clifford.

112
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:33,493

it was, uh...
It was productive.

113

to our fair town
torn asunder.

So, tell me, Archie.

119

What do you think
of the Russia problem?

120
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,021
The Russia problem, sir?

121
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:04,859
The Russians.
Arming themselves against us,

122
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,862
infiltrating us, undermining
our very way of life.

123
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:10,965

You're a very smart
young man, Archie.

00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,746
You remind me of your father.

Mary, after dinner, I think
we should adjourn to my study.

132
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,723

00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,008
Julian Blossom.

176
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,179
<i>Ethel was waiting</i>
<i>at the bus stop</i>
<i>to go to the dance</i>

177
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:15,550
<i>when Julian drove by</i>
<i>and offered to take her.</i>

178
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:16,884
You going to the dance?

179
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,887
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

180
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:24,925
[Jughead] <i>When instead,</i>
<i>he took her to Lover's Lane</i>

181
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,795
<i>and then tried</i>
<i>to put the moves on her.</i>

182
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,797
<i>As Ethel described it,</i>
<i>she welcomed it at first.</i>

183
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,100
<i>But Julian decided</i>
<i>to get a little handsy.</i>

184
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:35,035
[Julian grunts]

185
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,906
[Jughead] <i>Julian warned her</i>
<i>not to say anything</i>

186
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,709
<i>and that if she did, he would</i>
<i>call her a nymphomaniac.</i>

187
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,545
<i>Make her the town</i>
<i>laughingstock.</i>

188
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:44,812
[Veronica sighs]

189
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,081
Of course, we know
what happened after that.

190
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,817
When she decided to go home
instead of the dance.

191
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:51,719
Terrible.

192
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:54,455
I say we talk to Julian
at school tomorrow.

193
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,823
Ethel thinks
that ratting him out

194
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,158
is only going to make
things worse for her.

195
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:58,659
And she may be right.

196
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:02,062
So it's up to Julian
to do the honorable thing.

197
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:04,698
God help us.

198
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,704
[door opens]

199
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,645
And where have you been,
young lady?

200
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:20,014
I was just having coffee
with my friend Toni.

201
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:25,119
Hmm. Well, Mrs. Keller called.

202
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,288
Did you break up
with Kevin today?

203
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:28,523
[sighs]

204
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:32,493
Oh, Betty, why did you do that?

205
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:33,628
He is so upset.

206
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:34,929
He's devastated.

207
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:36,730
Mrs. Keller doesn't know
where he is.

208
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,567
She's worried sick.

209
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,767
Kevin is fine.

210
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,869
I just saw him
at the coffeehouse.

211
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,772
And rest assured, he's found
a shoulder to cry on.

212
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,740
A very manly shoulder.

213
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,544
And?

214
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:52,446
And looking back, that's been
the problem with
us this whole time, Mom.

215
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,114
Kevin likes boys.

216
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,717
Oh, Elizabeth.

217
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,118
Here, honey, come sit.

218
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,721
[Alice sighs]

219
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:02,256
[scoffs]

220
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:07,161
Even if he does,
it's just a phase.

221
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:11,098
See, carnal passion like that,
it never lasts.

222
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:12,066
It will fade.

223
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,569
And then, eventually,
he'll be ready to--

224
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:15,637
To what?

225
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,505
To kiss me? To want to kiss me?

226
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:19,240
To marry you.

227
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:20,508
To settle down.

228
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:21,909
Start a family.

229
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:25,547
Mom, how could I possibly
marry and live with Kevin,

230
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,481
knowing the truth now?

231
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:28,916
You and Kevin,

232
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:32,052
you've been building
a relationship for two years.

233
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:33,354
I know.

234
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:36,123
And if he's going through some
kind of sexual identity crisis,

235
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:39,026
don't you owe it to him
to help him through it?

236
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:42,263
If only as a friend.

237
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:51,405
[light buzzing]

238
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,973
Holy heck.

239
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,246
[sighs]

240
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:14,828
Hot Dog.

241
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,333
Where'd they take you, boy?

242
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,204
Well... [sighs]

243
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,473
That was torture.

244
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:29,778
Well, Mr. Blossom said
some nice stuff
about Dad, at least.

245
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,913
Oh, Clifford Blossom
has always been a hypocrite.

246
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,583
And a war profiteer
and a draft dodger.

247
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:37,284
How is he a war profiteer?

248
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:41,055
He sold maple syrup
to the Army at a premium
during the Korean War.

249
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:43,157
[sighs]

250
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,326
I've always managed to give
the Blossoms a wide berth.

251
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:49,330
But now, thanks to you,
we'll be linked
for the rest of our lives.

252
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:52,866
What are you talking about?

253
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,968
The Blossoms and I
have had a long talk.

254
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:59,073
And we've decided that,
based on your actions,

255
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,442
the best thing to do
would be for you and Cheryl...

256
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:03,377
to get married.

257
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:06,748
Married?

258
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,717
Aren't Cheryl and I
too young to do that?

259
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,687
Dr. Werthers will be giving
you and Cheryl a test tomorrow.

260
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,488
I have to take a test now too?

261
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,256
A compatibility test.

262
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,527
Cupid's checklist, to make sure
that you and Cheryl are--

263
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:20,861
Compatible.

264
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:24,331
Yes, and psychologically
ready to get married.

265
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:27,101
[clears throat]

266
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:30,471
Mom, this can't be
what you want for me.

267
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:31,472
It isn't.

268
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:34,308
But if you're old enough to...

269
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:37,077
do what you did,

270
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:39,848
then you're old enough
to take responsibility for it.

271
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,882
Think of Cheryl's honor.

272
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,918
That poor girl's reputation
could be destroyed.

273
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:46,887
And I know you don't want that.

274
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:03,404
Gosh, Midge... Are you sure?

275
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:04,405
I'm never late.

276
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,641
I'm scared, Fangs.

277
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:08,810
Don't worry, baby.
I love you.

278
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:11,278
We're going to figure this out.
I promise.

279
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,254
[scoffs] What do you two want?

280
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:23,357
We know that you were
with Ethel before
arriving to the dance.

281
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,363
Is that what Ethel says?

282
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,031
[scoffs] She wishes.

283
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:33,635
[chuckles]
You're a terrible liar.

284
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:35,969
If you already know
the whole story,
then why the third degree?

285
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,839
Because they're trying
to bamboozle Ethel.

286
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:40,842
You were the only one
that was with her when
her parents were eighty-sixed.

287
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,242
So you can be her alibi.

288
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,646
But you need to tell the truth
to Sheriff Keller.

289
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,580
I'm not doing that.

290
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:46,548
Why not?

291
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:47,481
I'm a Blossom.

292
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:50,417
It would be...

293
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,954
unseemly for me to admit
that I made a play
for someone as...

294
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,892
inappropriate
as Ethel Muggs.

295
00:15:57,926 --> 00:16:00,394
Then why do it
in the first place?

296
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,796
I don't know.

297
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,130
Cheap thrills, I guess.

298
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:06,601
What the hell, Jones?

299
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,135
You disgust me, Julian.

300
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,872
People like you
make my stomach churn.

301
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:13,073
You're rich.
You're entitled.

302
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,610
You strut around the world
like you own it.

303
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:19,346
And then you take
advantage of people
like my friend, Ethel.

304
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,382
So you're going to do
the right thing
for once in your life.

305
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:34,863
Julian gave a statement.

306
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:36,163
Ethel's free to go, right?

307
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,332
Yeah. She's no longer
an active suspect.

308
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,702
Though an adult is gonna need
to sign her out.

309
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:44,104
The Coopers are on their way.
They've agreed
to take her in again.

310
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,543
[Dr. Werthers]
My compatibility test,

311
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:50,110
or, uh, Cupid's checklist,

312
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,547
shall we say, consists
of only three questions.

313
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:56,784
First question.

314
00:16:56,818 --> 00:16:58,720
Do you come
from similar backgrounds?

315
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:02,489
The Blossoms are descended
from European
barons and baronesses.

316
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,192
Um, my dad used to talk about

317
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,696
how Grandpa Artie and his wife
barely survived the Dust Bowl.

318
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,030
Very good.

319
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:13,100
Second question.

320
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,836
Are you close friends?

321
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,672
[scoffs] Um...

322
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:21,809
You know, I pride myself
on getting along
with pretty much everyone.

323
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:23,210
Hmm.

324
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,949
Last question.

325
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:30,518
Do you understand
the concept of marriage?

326
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:36,189
Uh... Um...

327
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,493
Marriage is not to be
taken lightly, Ms. Blossom.

328
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:44,064
And you, Mr. Andrews,
you must remain faithful.

329
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,568
It goes against our nature
as men, of course.

330
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:48,168
But...

331
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,639
a kind word, sympathetic ear
and a home-cooked meal

332
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:56,243
can go a long way
towards keeping
a wandering eye in check.

333
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:00,213
Have I clarified things?

334
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:06,921
[Penelope] Well, that is such
a relief to hear, Dr. Werthers.

335
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:09,222
Mrs. Andrews and I are elated.

336
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:11,458
Yes, we'll talk soon.

337
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,527
My best to Myrna.

338
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:17,732
The most wonderful news,
Mary, dear.

339
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,166
The children are compatible.

340
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,269
Well, frankly, I'm surprised.

341
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:26,608
You know, Archie and Cheryl
are so different.

342
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:31,178
Well, they both have that
glorious red hair, don't they?

343
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:41,121
[Toni] <i>Hey, Fangs.</i>
<i>How's it hanging?</i>

344
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:44,025
Not well, Toni.

345
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:47,461
Midge thinks that she
might be in trouble.

346
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:49,597
Oh, jeez.

347
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:50,430
Are you sure?

348
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,467
Not 100%, but, yeah,
pretty sure.

349
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,203
Okay, well,
first things first.

350
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,172
We need to confirm that Midge
is, in fact, pregnant.

351
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,876
Here's what we're going to do.

352
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,276
You, me and Midge
are going to meet

353
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,847
at the biology lab
at school tonight at midnight.

354
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,684
That'll give me enough time
to gather the supplies
we need to make our own test.

355
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,121
Can you dig it?

356
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:14,856
Big Daddy?

357
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:16,256
[sighs]

358
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,293
[piano music playing]

359
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,268
Kev, can we talk?

360
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:31,639
[door closes]

361
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,710
I went to the Dark Room
last night,

362
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,514
and I saw you and Clay there.

363
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:43,350
[scoffs] Yeah, I don't know
what you think you saw,

364
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,318
but Clay and I were just
kidding around.

365
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:49,757
No.
No, you weren't.

366
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,631
How long have you and Clay...

367
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,670
[sighs] Last night
was the first time.

368
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:09,242
After you broke up with me,
I went to the gym and...

369
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:12,312
just was bawling
my eyes out and...

370
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,016
Clay was in the locker room

371
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:17,785
and he just heard me,
and he came
and just talked to me and...

372
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:25,193
I'm sorry.

373
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:28,963
I know this must be
throwing you for a loop,
but just believe me.

374
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:30,497
If I had known what...

375
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:34,802
I... I was, I wouldn't
have wasted your time.

376
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:44,311
I'm not going to pretend
that I understand most of this.

377
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:48,750
But our relationship
was not a waste of time.

378
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:52,252
At least not to me.

379
00:20:57,191 --> 00:21:00,327
[bright pop music playing]

380
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:04,665
[both slurping]

381
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:11,672
Well, I guess it's happening.

382
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,842
Mr. and Mrs. Andrews.

383
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:16,644
So, it seems.

384
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:24,384
Cheryl, are you... Are you sure
you really wanna
go through with this?

385
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,020
Would it really be that bad?

386
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:27,188
To be married to you?

387
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:29,791
No. Oh, heck, no.

388
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:36,097
I just... I wanna
get to know you better.

389
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,333
And through that process,
maybe I'll get to know
myself better too.

390
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,469
I think it's easy
to figure out your path

391
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:45,305
when someone's
walking alongside you.

392
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:52,880
Word around school is
you wrote Veronica
a beautiful love poem.

393
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:58,119
Maybe you could
find it in your heart
to write one for me.

394
00:21:58,152 --> 00:21:59,854
Yeah, yeah. Sure I can.

395
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:07,895
[jazz music playing]

396
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,163
To small victories.

397
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:10,497
Hear, hear!

398
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:12,233
Though Ethel's not out
of the woods just yet.

399
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:15,937
No, but she's in a better place
than she was two hours ago.

400
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:19,006
[Jughead clears throat]

401
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,709
We make a good team, Nick.

402
00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:23,811
Yes, we do, Nora.

403
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:24,779
[chuckles]

404
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:29,150
So, after dinner,

405
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:32,053
what do you think
about walking me home?

406
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:33,788
Oh, shucks...

407
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:36,824
I was actually planning
on staying here tonight.

408
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:37,758
At the diner?

409
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:39,961
Why?

410
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:42,563
Sheriff Keller
and his goon squad
trashed my train car.

411
00:22:42,897 --> 00:22:43,798
Oh.

412
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,268
Well...

413
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:49,436
do you want to stay
at the Pembrooke?

414
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:51,772
[both chuckle]

415
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:54,842
No, no. I'm...
I'm allergic to silk sheets.

416
00:22:56,277 --> 00:22:58,112
You're in luck, then.

417
00:22:58,145 --> 00:23:00,413
Because we only
have sheets made

418
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:03,383
from the finest
Egyptian cotton.

419
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:05,820
Well, I wouldn't
wanna crowd you.

420
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:08,222
Please. There's an entire
wing of the apartment

421
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:09,657
I haven't even set foot in.

422
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:12,593
Really, I insist.

423
00:23:19,634 --> 00:23:21,969
-[frog croaking]
-I'm confused, Toni.

424
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:25,438
How will any of this stuff
tell us whether or not
I'm pregnant?

425
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:27,642
It's a simple process.

426
00:23:27,675 --> 00:23:31,379
I'm going to inject
some of your pee
into our friend here.

427
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,114
And if you're pregnant,
it's gonna cause

428
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:37,285
a chemical reaction
in the frog, causing it
to lay eggs overnight.

429
00:23:37,318 --> 00:23:39,153
Will it hurt the frog?

430
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:42,089
No, it's quick and painless.

431
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:43,524
Promise.

432
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:46,861
Okay, I got Midge's pee
in a cup in a bag here.

433
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:49,797
So why don't you two
just wait outside
and I'll be out in a jiffy?

434
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,867
[frog croaking]

435
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,546
[frog croaking]

436
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:10,584
Well, Midge,
you're definitely preggers.

437
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:14,021
There's like,
400-500 eggs in there.

438
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:16,357
Oh, my God.

439
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,559
All right.
Fangs, Midge, listen up.

440
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:20,460
Do you two love each other?

441
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,697
-Yeah, we do.
-Completely.

442
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,465
All right. Fangs, you're going
to have to clean yourself up.

443
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,368
Wash the grease
out of your hair,

444
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:28,836
put on a button-up shirt

445
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:31,605
and go ask the Klumps
for Midge's hand in marriage.

446
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:33,874
I'd do anything for Midge.

447
00:24:33,908 --> 00:24:37,378
But no way will her folks
give us their blessing.

448
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:39,613
Well, you're gonna
at least have to try.

449
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:42,249
And maybe they'll surprise you.

450
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:46,020
But, I wouldn't tell them
that Midge has a bun
in the oven just yet.

451
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,627
[plates clanking]

452
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:57,497
Good morning.
What's all this?

453
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:59,600
Well, I woke up early.
I figured I'd make you

454
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:01,736
a little breakfast
as a show of gratitude.

455
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:04,005
Little?

456
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:07,074
My typical breakfast
consists of half a grapefruit
and a cup of coffee.

457
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:10,945
I feel like I'm at
the Polo Lounge
having Sunday brunch.

458
00:25:10,978 --> 00:25:14,048
How did you sleep?
Were the sheets to your liking?

459
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:15,583
I slept like a log.

460
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:18,652
But I'll admit,
I do feel a bit like
Little Orphan Annie in here.

461
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:21,956
Which makes me, who?
Daddy Warbucks?

462
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:26,894
Should we walk
to school together?

463
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:28,863
I'm skipping school today.

464
00:25:28,896 --> 00:25:32,366
I have to go to the pound
and spring Hot Dog.

465
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,402
And then I have to fix up
my train car.

466
00:25:34,435 --> 00:25:35,936
Well then, I'll skip too.

467
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:39,974
Why don't you focus
on getting Hot Dog

468
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:42,743
and I'll focus on
sprucing up your train car?

469
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:46,614
[Betty] <i>Wait a minute.</i>

470
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:48,983
You and Cheryl
didn't go all the way?

471
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:53,154
But now you two
are getting married?

472
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:54,388
I know. It's confusing.

473
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:55,723
It's lunacy, Arch.

474
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:57,358
Why don't you just tell
your mom the truth,

475
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:59,160
so you don't have
to do any of this?

476
00:25:59,193 --> 00:26:00,694
Cheryl's in trouble, Betty.

477
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:03,532
And I want to protect her.

478
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,433
And it's weird to say,
but if I can save her

479
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:07,768
from something,
it might help me...

480
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,337
I don't know.

481
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:12,640
Figure out my purpose in life.

482
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:16,110
But do you love her?

483
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,549
-I could.
-[sighs]

484
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:21,882
I mean, according
to Dr. Werthers,

485
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,651
love grows over time.
He showed us a graph.

486
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:25,619
It starts when you're 17
and it peaks when you're 21.

487
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:27,455
I mean, that's when you
really start loving someone.

488
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:31,759
Arch, there's a difference
between saving someone
and loving someone.

489
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,895
What if the love never grows?

490
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:40,334
Archie. My father
has requested a sit-down
with us after school.

491
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:42,369
I trust you can
accommodate him.

492
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:44,405
-I'll be there.
<i>-Wunderbar.</i>

493
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:45,739
I'll let him know.

494
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,209
Betty.

495
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:55,082
You're a wonderful guy, Arch.

496
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:57,651
And it's really sweet
that you wanna help Cheryl.

497
00:26:57,685 --> 00:27:01,222
But marriage is forever.

498
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,892
It's the rest of your life.

499
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:13,901
[Clifford] So very happy
to hear that you passed
Dr. Werthers' evaluation.

500
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:16,203
I suppose you're both wondering
what happens next.

501
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:20,274
Well, we were thinking
of a small ceremony
at Niagara Falls.

502
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,675
Don't be asinine, Cheryl.

503
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,944
You're going to be married
by a judge at Thornhill.

504
00:27:23,978 --> 00:27:27,348
And I will set Archie up
with a part-time job
at the Naval factory.

505
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,383
And you'll both graduate
high school, of course.

506
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,885
And college as well.

507
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:32,686
That's a waste
of time and money.

508
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,688
After high school,
you, Archie, will enter into

509
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:36,957
the Blossom Management
Training program.

510
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:40,995
And once that's completed,
we'll start you on full-time.

511
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:43,230
Cheryl will help her mother
manage Thornhill,

512
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:45,666
eventually learning how
to run the estate herself.

513
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:47,434
Why? It's not as if
we're gonna live here.

514
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:49,303
Certainly you will.

515
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,738
Where else are you gonna live?

516
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:54,842
Well, Cheryl and I haven't
talked about it yet, sir,

517
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,580
but I was thinking we could
move into my parent's house.

518
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:01,682

recognized you, Fangs.

00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:25,640
How did it go with the Klumps?

523
00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:27,074
It went horrible.

524
00:28:28,475 --> 00:28:29,944
They had a conniption.

525
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:34,882
Forbade me from
ever seeing Midge again.

526
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:37,818
Yeah, I was afraid
that was gonna happen.

527
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:39,621
Midge is rich.

what the Klumps say.

Once you become rich and famous

[sighs]
I was reading it, Mom.

566

To try to make
some sense of my life,

567

tell me is backwards
and nonsensical.

Watch your tone, little miss.

569
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:56,890
A girl your age should not
be reading this filth.

00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:59,093
Well, then when, Mom?

571
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:01,862
And it's not filth.
It's just the truth.

572

[Ethel] It's mine.

Oh, Ethel. Why am I
not surprised?

577

It doesn't matter
