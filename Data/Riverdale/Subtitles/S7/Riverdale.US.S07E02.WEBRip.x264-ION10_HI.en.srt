Yeah. Yeah, just for kicks.

Excuse me. Sorry.

but I think Elvis sang it better."

You've been quiet all night.

Um...

368
00:22:26,158 --> 00:22:27,869
It's beautiful and all. Uh...

369
00:22:28,452 --> 00:22:32,915
I guess I just prefer an artist
like Norman Rockwell.

00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:37,461
Then again, I'm not an
art-tour-through-Europe kind of guy.

That's obvious from what you're wearing.

It's my father's suit.

Wasn't he buried in his suit?

Or did he have more than one?

00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,102
He was buried in his uniform.

Well, I, for one,
think you look very striking, Archie.

And I like a bit of variety
in my men's attire.

Well, that's actually why I'm here.
I feel terrible about it.

And then all of those feelings
will settle.

Won't a pin mean
she'll expect more from me?

Oh, no. A pin takes off the pressure.
