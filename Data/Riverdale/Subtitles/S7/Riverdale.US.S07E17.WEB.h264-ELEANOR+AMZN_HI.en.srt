has not only earned herself a seat
at the glorious table that is Tinseltown,

683
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:23,058
she has commandeered
the whole damn restaurant."

684
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:32,710
Is this really happening?
I'm not dreaming?

685
00:39:32,793 --> 00:39:34,673
Josie, it's not happening.

686
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:36,803
It happened.

687
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:39,186
You made it happen.

688
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:40,606
And, as far as I'm concerned,

689
00:39:40,689 --> 00:39:43,364
put Riverdale and the Babylonium
on the map tonight.

690
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,992
So thank you for that.

691
00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:48,377
And by the way, there's one thing
this reviewer got wrong.

692
00:39:49,128 --> 00:39:51,176
A star wasn't born tonight.

693
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:53,308
You've always been a star, Josie.

694
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:57,318
From the first second you drew breath.

695
00:39:58,113 --> 00:39:59,658
You weren't even at the hospital.

696
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:02,708
You're not wrong, though.

697
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:08,097
We make a good team, you and I.
Perhaps we should do this again.

698
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,435
I wonder, Veronica,

699
00:40:09,518 --> 00:40:13,404
if you're not just treading water here
managing a theater,

700
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:15,994
when what you should be doing
is making movies.

701
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,793
Ah-ha-ha.

702
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:20,924
I see I've intrigued you.

703
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:24,935
It's what Josie McCoy does best.

704
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:32,204
Uncle Frank?

705
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,293
What's going on?

706
00:40:35,128 --> 00:40:37,134
Reggie, will you give us a minute?

707
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,440
What the hell is this?

708
00:40:44,113 --> 00:40:46,451
Mrs. Grundy asked us
to write about our most...

709
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:50,838
personal and private pain.

710
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:57,314
<i>Overseas or in mountain marsh
That's where you really are</i>

711
00:40:57,398 --> 00:40:59,863
<i>You have a plot of land here at home</i>

712
00:41:01,784 --> 00:41:03,957
<i>But you will always
Be lost to me over there</i>

713
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:06,882
Writing poetry to get with a girl is fine,
I said that.

714
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:10,475
But writing about your father?

715
00:41:10,558 --> 00:41:14,777
Exploiting his sacrifice for our country,
for our family?

716
00:41:15,698 --> 00:41:16,533
No.

717
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:17,912
No!

718
00:41:17,995 --> 00:41:20,920
You will not sully his memory like this!

719
00:41:21,003 --> 00:41:22,883
What's wrong with me writing about my dad?

720
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:25,223
I wish I could still talk to him,
but I can't.

721
00:41:25,307 --> 00:41:26,351
At least this way...

722
00:41:26,937 --> 00:41:28,607
Uncle Frank, stop!

723
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:31,406
Don't you ever...

724
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:34,121
write about your father like that again.

725
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:38,132
Am I understood?

726
