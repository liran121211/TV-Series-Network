-[door closes]
<i>-Mr. Fieldstone,</i>

10
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:26,928
the comic book that you
just published

11
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:29,363
is beat for beat,
exactly like a story

12
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:33,635
-that Brad Rayberry
published ten years ago.
-Hold on.

13
00:00:33,668 --> 00:00:37,137
The Rayberry story
is called <i>November County.</i>

Ours is called
<i>November Country.</i>

15
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:41,676
Is Pep Comics
in the business
of plagiarizing?

16
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,812
That is an ugly word
we never use around here,
all right?

17
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:48,783
But it's all coming
back to me now.

18
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:52,554
I dimly remember
trying to reach out
to this Rayberry guy

00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:55,657
about a rights inquiry.

20
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,393
But he never returned my calls,
so I just assumed
he was probably dead.

You know, I've been here
a couple of days now,

22
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,602

23
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,138

24
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:19,179

before he went off to war?

30

Remind me.

31
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,366
He said that I should
take care of mom.

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,102
And be the man of the house.

33
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,605

00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,168
Bettie Page herself
would go ape for you.

174
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,438
This was a silly idea.

175
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:32,339
-I'm gonna change.
-Betty, wait.

176
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:34,008
Come here.

177
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,313
Give yourself a minute
to get used to the lace.

178
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,050
Deep breaths.

179
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:44,418
[inhales]

180
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:46,320
[both exhaling]

181
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,789
Now look at yourself.

182
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:52,126
Look at your beautiful body
and repeat after me.

183
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:58,766
"I am a gorgeous,
powerful, sexy siren,

184
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,068
at the height
of my womanly powers."

185
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:07,074
And may God have mercy
on the boys of Riverdale High.

186
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,248
[knocking on door]

187
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,687
[door unlocks]

188
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:23,624
Oh, wow. Mr. Rayberry, uh...

189
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,793
I'm Jughead Jones.

190
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,929
I'm a writer over at
Pep Comics in Riverdale,

191
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,065
and I know for a fact
that they are plagiarizing

192
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,968
and publishing your stories
for monetary gain.

193
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,336
Huh?

194
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:37,238
They're ripping you off.

195
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:44,278
I think you should send them
a cease and desist letter

196
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,615
-or sue them or something.
-Yeah, hold on, hold on.

197
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,983
You're employed by Pep Comics,

198
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,051
and you want me
to sue Pep Comics?

199
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:52,153
Why?

200
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:56,490
Well, that might be
a bit extreme.

201
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,692
But, uh... [chuckles nervously]

202
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:01,028
I think you're the tops.

203
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,398
And I... You... You shouldn't
be treated this way.

204
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:08,503
I, um... I'm sure it's just
some kind of misunderstanding.

205
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:09,937
Uh, it's... It's...

206
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,873
It's not.

207
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:15,843
It's theft.
I went through
all of Pep Comics' back issues.

208
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:19,013
They've poached
like eight of your stories.

209
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:22,316
Um, this is just
the latest one.

210
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,756
[Cheryl] <i>Spit it out, Evelyn.</i>

211
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:34,461
I have some concerns,

212
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:36,463
about our new Vixen,
Toni Topaz.

213
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:39,800
Feeling threatened should only
make you work harder.

214
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:45,105
I just don't think that
we should have girls
like Toni on our squad.

215
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:49,176
You best choose your next words
very carefully, Evelyn.

216
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,613
Riverdale High
is fully integrated,
as are the Vixens.

217
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:53,047
If you have
a problem with that--

218
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,450
No, my problem isn't with
Toni being Black. It's...

219
00:11:56,483 --> 00:12:00,387
Well, it's with the fact
that everyone knows
that she's a lezzie.

220
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:03,257
And I wouldn't be comfortable
being naked in
the locker room with her.

221
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,894
I don't know where
you heard such
a disgusting rumor, Evelyn,

222
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:10,297
but let me clue you in.
Toni Topaz is not a...

223
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:13,635
Whatever that word is.

224
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:15,869
I wouldn't tolerate such
behavior on my squad,

225
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,939
so shut your damn
mouth about it!

226
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:21,342
Now, kindly put an egg
in your shoe and beat it.

227
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,011
A new episode of <i>Oh, Mija</i>
is about to begin and you're
not invited to stay and watch.

228
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:28,816
[Lizzo] <i>Topaz.</i>

229
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,653
The scuttlebutt is you're
a paper-shaker now.

230
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:34,154
[laughs] What happened?

231
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,422
Let me guess.

232
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:38,192
Still bird-dogging
that redheaded closet-case?

233
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:41,228
Well, not that I have
to justify my actions
to you, Lizzo,

234
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:45,533
you're currently looking
at Riverdale High's first
Black cheerleader ever.

235
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:49,069
Now, that may not mean
a lot to you,
but it does to me.

236
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,771
So it's political for you.

237
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:53,173
Yeah. Got it. That makes sense.

238
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,776
Damn, Topaz.
You must really be on the hook.

239
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,013
Not that I blame you.

240
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:01,549
That's one cherry lollipop
I'd happily lick.

241
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:03,450
[chuckles]

242
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:14,295
[clears throat]

243
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,498
What the heck did you
do with my car?

244
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:20,868
Well, that hot rod
was an unnecessary
distraction, Archie.

245
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,637
Don't worry,
it's safe and sound,

246
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,305
and you'll get it back
once your grades
are where they should be.

247
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:26,273
How do you expect me
to get to school?

248
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:29,544
You can walk, take the bus,
ride your bike.

249
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:32,413
Or you can hitch
a ride with me,
but you better hustle.

250
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:35,082
You don't want to be late
for your first day
as water-boy.

251
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:45,926
Well, are you wearing them?

252
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,997
Don't flip out,
but I am not.

253
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,067
Betty, how will you ever
get used to lace panties

254
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,902
if you don't wear
them every day?

255
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:57,438
You know, I know,
but there's gym class
later today,

256
00:13:57,471 --> 00:13:59,173
and I didn't want people
to see me wearing them

257
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:02,142
and think that I was
some kind of nymphomaniac.

258
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:06,815
Yet another word
invented by men
who want to gaslight women.

259
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,118
Anyway, now that I'm
your new wing woman,
I've been thinking.

260
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:15,089
It's time we found you a man,

261
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,324
who can appreciate
what an incredible,

262
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:20,562
powerful, beautiful
knockout you are.

263
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:23,598
So, now that you and Kevin
are no more, who do you
have your eye on?

264
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:27,334
There is someone, actually.

265
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:28,570
Don't be coy.

266
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:29,571
Who's the lucky duck?

267
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:32,339
It's Archie.

268
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,242
[laughs sheepishly]

269
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,914
Yes, Archie is a teen
dream boat, isn't he?

270
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,015
[chuckles softly]

271
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,487
Well, you're in luck.

272
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:49,591
I spied him in the lounge
mere seconds ago.

273
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:52,493
So why don't you march on
in there and ask him out?

274
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:55,262
Let's do it now, before you can
talk yourself out of it.

275
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,268
Hi, Archie.

276
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,673
Betty, hey.
What's the scoop?

277
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,577
The scoop is...

278
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,483
Do you maybe want to go
to the movies with me?

279
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:18,686
The movies?

280
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,989
Well, heck yeah, Betty.
I would love to take you
to the movies.

281
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,157
[Betty] Really?

282
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,261
But I can't.

283
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,433
I can't right now.

284
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,536
It's my Uncle Frank.
He's being a real
pain in the ass.

285
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:37,705
He's got me on a trip
for biscuits making me
the team water-boy.

286
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:43,511
Maybe he'll ease up
in the next couple of weeks
and we can go then?

287
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:49,416
Of course.
Yeah, another time.
It's fine.

288
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:54,589
[Betty crying]

289
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:57,525
At least he was nice enough
to come up with an excuse.

290
00:15:58,526 --> 00:16:00,394
Or it's the truth.

291
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:04,298
And you just need
to let Archie work out
his family strife for a bit.

292
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,200
[sighs]

293
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:10,572
Say, why don't we nab ourselves
a couple of good time boys

294
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:11,539
and go on a double date?

295
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,676
With... With who?

296
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,377
Isn't there an all-boys
private school down the lane?

297
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,747
-You mean Stonewall Prep?
-Mmm.

298
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:21,549
<i>J'adore</i> private school boys.

299
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,384
So sexually frustrated.

300
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,554
So easy to torment
and manipulate.

301
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,057
Hmm.

302
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,026
["Sweet Georgia Brown" playing]

303
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:56,183
Let's see what we have here.

304
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,459
"A story of forbidden
feminine love."

305
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:07,629
[laughs]

306
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,429
I knew it.

307
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:10,565
[Toni] Excuse me.

308
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:12,132
Can I help you
with something, Evelyn?

309
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,503
You know, it's strange, Toni.

310
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:19,339
When I asked her,
Cheryl insisted that you
weren't gaga for girls.

311
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:22,476
This book, however,
tells a different story.

312
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,379
As a matter of fact,
I read all kinds of books.

313
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,282
So how about you quit
sticking your nose
in my business

314
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:30,919
before I serve you up
a knuckle sandwich?

315
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:32,720
Can you dig it?

316
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:34,288
Now, why don't you tell me

317
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,658
exactly what Cheryl said.

318
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:40,127
[Fieldstone] So,
what do you think?

319
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,864
First issue,
hot off the presses.

320
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,933
-This is so boss, boss.
-[laughs]

321
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:47,301
I mean, to see it in full color
and in print with my name.

322
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:48,736
And that's just
the final proof.

323
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,637
[footsteps approaching]

324
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,675
Which one of you
shucksters is Al Fieldstone?

325
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,877
I am. Who are you?

326
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,612
Brad Rayberry.

327
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:00,080
You've been plagiarizing
my short stories
for your comic books.

328
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,717
Hey, now. What's to say
that two different writers

329
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,319
couldn't have had
similar ideas concurrently?

330
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:08,723
Once maybe, but eight times?

331
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,925
Do you think
that's going to pass
muster in the courts?

332
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,026
The courts?

333
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,493
[laughs] You listen to me, pal.

334
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:16,129
I have got the top lawyers
in New York on retainer.

335
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:18,733
Uh, fellas,
acknowledging that...

336
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:23,403
someone at some time
might have read a book
and been inspired by it,

337
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,339
what if we put
Mr. Rayberry's name

338
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:28,610
on all future
reprints of stories
that are similar to his,

339
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:32,279
and pay him a modest
but appropriate fee

340
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,581
for the rights
to adapt his work?

341

00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:57,044
Yeah. Yeah,
my uncle's the coach.

516
00:27:57,077 --> 00:28:01,315
You know, I used to watch
your dad play
when he was in school.

517
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:04,685
Best rebounder
Riverdale High had ever seen.

518
00:28:04,718 --> 00:28:08,422
Well, he and I, we used
to play a lot, growing up.
Right up until...

519
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:13,727
he went off to the war.

520
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:16,830
Proud of him for serving
our country the way he did.

521
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:19,934
He was a true hero.

522
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:22,102
Yeah, he was, Pop.

523
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,305
He honest-to-gosh was.

524
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,580
[Jughead] <i>I read until</i>
<i>the sun came up.</i>

525
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:33,180
<i>Mr. Rayberry's novel,</i>

526
00:28:33,214 --> 00:28:35,550
<i>The</i> Jupiter Journals
<i>was like</i> Flash Gordon,

527
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:37,586
<i>as if Fitzgerald</i>
<i>had written it.</i>

528
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,354
<i>And I couldn't believe</i>
<i>that Mr. Rayberry</i>
<i>was just letting it sit,</i>

529
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:42,456
<i>unpublished in a cardboard box.</i>

530
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,892
[Veronica] <i>So, Betty,</i>

531
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:47,294
what happened when Willie
walked you home last night?

532
00:28:47,328 --> 00:28:49,230
Nothing. No butterflies.

533
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:52,132
Oh, dear.

534
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,034
Is it that your
heart's still set on Archie,
do you think?

535
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:56,337
Yes, which means I'm doomed.

536
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,473
Betty, we talked about this.

537
00:28:59,507 --> 00:29:02,876
Romeo and Juliet
had logistical problems,
but they figured it out.

538
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,311
Veronica, they both died.

539
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:06,715
Not until act five.

540
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,617
-[sighs]
-And only after they lost

541
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,117
their cherries, I might add.

542
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:13,821
Anyways, I have an idea.

543
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,592
One way to get close to someone

544
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:20,528
is by having long, meaningful

545
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:22,129
late night conversations
with them.

546
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:27,501
So, why don't you and Archie
wait for your respective

547
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:29,770
gatekeeping adults
to go to sleep?

548
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:33,240
Then, call each other up
on the telephone.

549
00:29:33,274 --> 00:29:35,009
Start having intimate
heart to hearts

550
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,777
and get to know
each other that way.

551
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,581
Well, I wish, but Archie
doesn't have a telephone
in his bedroom.

552
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:40,481
Shoot.

553
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:42,783
Are you sure?

554
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:44,385
I am. I can look
into Archie's room from mine.

555
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:46,954
Sorry.

556
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:50,124
You can look into Archie's
bedroom window from yours?

557
00:29:56,163 --> 00:29:57,464
Does this mean
you've glimpsed him--

558
00:29:57,498 --> 00:30:00,401
Yes, many, many times.

559
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:06,974
Betty, I think I have to see
this floor show for myself.

560
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:09,143
What time does
the curtain usually go up?

561
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:15,215
[Julian] Hey, grease monkey.

562
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:19,019
When I got home last night,
I noticed a smudge
on my windshield.

563
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:20,421
Why don't you bring it
back to the station?

564
00:30:20,454 --> 00:30:21,723
I'll take another crack at it.

565
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:23,558
I'll do that.

566
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:25,993
In the meantime,
how about you get me
a soda from the cafeteria...

567
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:28,329
water-boy?

568
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:29,363
[all laugh]

569
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:32,132
Why don't you get it
yourself, Julian?

570
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,268
I would, but I'm saving
my energy,

571
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,236
so I can obliterate
your dad's record

572
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,305
against Centerville
this weekend.

573
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:41,275
I mean, somebody's
got to do it.

574
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,877
And it's clearly
not going to be--

575
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:47,181
[intense music playing]

576
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:51,985
[student] Hey, whoa.

577
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:58,660
[Frank] Mary, I just got here
and I heard what happened.

578
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:01,529
I'll talk to Featherhead
and we'll straighten
out this mess.

579
00:31:01,563 --> 00:31:02,764
Back off, Frank.

580
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:04,064
I'm his mother.

581
00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:05,232
I'll take this round.

582
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:10,871
[whistle blows]

583
00:31:10,904 --> 00:31:12,306
Gather up, girls.

584
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:14,743
I've decided on assignments
for the season.

585
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:17,111
For starters,
Toni Topaz will perch

586
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:19,079
at the top of our
Vixens pyramid.

587
00:31:20,114 --> 00:31:21,382
But I'm always the flyer.

588
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:23,117
-Not this year.
-This is outrageous.

589
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:26,755
No, this is cheerleading.

590
00:31:26,788 --> 00:31:28,922
Of course,
if you're feeling frosted

591
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:34,194
by my leadership choices,
you're welcome to quit,
Evelyn. Immediately.

592
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,937
-I'll stay.
-Sorry. What was that?

593
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:46,006
-I'll stay.
-Ah, fab.

594
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,942
Now, on to other business.

595
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:53,615
[Mary] <i>Archie, tell me</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>

596
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:57,985
I saw you and your father
play basketball
practically every day.

597
00:31:58,018 --> 00:31:59,554
You love it.

598
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:01,422
So why don't you want
to play on the team?

599
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:04,458
Is it because of Uncle Frank?

600
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:05,426
No.

601
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,461
No, it's not, Frank.

602
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:11,999
It's... Well, you said it, Mom.

603
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:17,004
Basketball was something
Dad and I did together.

604
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:19,973
Whenever I walk into a gym
or pick up a ball...

605
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,444
I think about Dad.

606
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:25,979
And suddenly it's like
there's an anvil on my heart.

607
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:29,751
And if I played, I just know

608
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:33,487
all I'd be thinking is
"I wish Dad were here
watching me from the stands."

609
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:34,455
I understand.

610
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:37,491
I wish that too.

611
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:41,729
And then there's
the other thing.

612
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:45,299
If I played...

613
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:48,469
What if I wasn't good enough?

614
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:51,972
What if I tarnished
Dad's memory?

615
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:54,141
Oh, Archie.

616
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:56,009
I know Frank suggested
that your father

617
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:59,848
wouldn't be proud of you,
but that is simply not true.

618
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:02,517
Your father would be so proud.

619
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,820
Listen, you don't have
to play basketball
if you don't want to.

620
00:33:05,854 --> 00:33:09,456
But nothing would make
your father happier than to see
you play on his team.

621
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:12,359
Maybe even wearing his number.

622
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:15,395
Nothing would make
me happier, too.

623
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:18,999
And one way or the other,

624
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:20,702
I'm going to ask
Frank to ease up on you.

625
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:22,436
[chuckles softly]

626
00:33:23,872 --> 00:33:25,507
[door closes]

627
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,241
Mr. Rayberry, I...

628
00:33:27,274 --> 00:33:31,746
really hope you don't get
upset, but I read your novel.

629
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:34,047
[chuckles]

630
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:36,918
Golly, I... I loved it.

631
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:40,354
-You have got
to get this published.
-Eh.

632
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:45,125
Just a minute. You...
You stole my manuscript?

633
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:46,895
Only for a night.

634
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:50,130
You are as much
of a thief as Fieldstone.

635
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:52,634
Oh, Mr. Rayberry, please, I--

636
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,969
No, get out of here.

637
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:56,504
Give me my manuscript.

638
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:58,540
Yeah, no, I'll go.

639
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:00,207
But you have got
to get this published.

640
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,644
-I can help you--
-Get out of my house.

641
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:16,056
Pretty swinging how you gave
that Evernever chick what for.

642
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:18,626
I always strive for the best
cheer team possible.

643
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,994
Well...

644
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:22,496
I'd like to show you
my appreciation.

645
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:24,298
Would that be okay?

646
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,067
Mo... More than okay.

647
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:33,407
<i>♪ Lord, show me ♪</i>

648
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,745

[sighs] This isn't exactly
what I imagined our
stakeout would be like.

653
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:56,330
What exactly did you imagine?

654
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:59,767
Truthfully? Jimmy Stewart
and Grace Kelly in <i>Rear Window.</i>

655
00:35:00,802 --> 00:35:01,669
[Betty] Hmm.

656
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:05,405
[Veronica] Hello.

657
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:08,241
We interrupt your regularly
scheduled programming

658
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,511
with an emergency
flutter bum alert.

659
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,047
God bless America.

660
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:15,083
[chuckles]

661
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:19,319
Stand back, Ringling Brothers,
because this is the greatest
show on Earth.

662
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:21,254
Ooh, do you have binoculars?

663
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:24,892
Never mind.

664
00:35:24,926 --> 00:35:29,129
We don't even need them
with the size of Archie's
bulging... muscles.

665
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:32,132
-[gasps]
-Mayday. Duck and cover.

666
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:35,036
Oh, my God,
I should have known.

667
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:37,705
The same thing happened
to Jimmy Stewart.

668
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:40,140
Yeah, but at least he was
trying to catch a murderer.

669
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:42,610
We're just peeping Patties.

670
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:43,511
Ugh!

671
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:47,247
[chuckles]

672
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:51,552
[students chattering
indistinctly]

673
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:52,987
[Veronica]
Did you get any sleep?

674
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:56,490
-[sighs] Not a wink. You?
-The same.

675
00:35:56,524 --> 00:35:59,292
But it gave me time to think.
And if he did see us,

676
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:03,230
then he's probably just
as embarrassed as we are,
and won't say a word about it.

677
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,400
I mean,
it's positively shameless.

678
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:09,436
The way he struts around
like a... like a peacock,

679
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:12,006
flashing those absurd
abdominal muscles over there--

680
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,907
[Archie clears throat]

681
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:16,376
Howdy, ladies.

682
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:18,680
How's it going?

683
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:21,248
Archie, good morning.

684
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:23,618
Veronica, would you mind
giving Betty and I a minute?

685
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:25,753
In... In private?

686
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:32,627
-Of course. Betty,
we'll catch up anon.
-Mmm.

687
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:36,964
Archie... keep up
the good work.

688
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:46,708
So, I...

689
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:51,311
saw you
and Veronica last night.

690
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,648
Looking at me.

691
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:58,686
Oh, sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

692
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,253
Betty, it's okay.

693
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:03,725
I liked it.

694
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:07,695
You know, my uncle's
got me real busy
during the day, but...

695
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:10,464
every night I end up
in my room.

696
00:37:13,668 --> 00:37:19,239
Every night I end up
in my bedroom, too.

697
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:21,308
What if we ended up
in our bedrooms,

698
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,745
you know, at the same time?

699
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:25,546
And...

700
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:27,615
looked at each other?

701
00:37:30,118 --> 00:37:32,787
How about tonight?
Say midnight?

702
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:36,958
Yeah, I'll be there.

703
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:39,259
Same.

704
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:43,296
And I'll be wearing
something special.

705
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,503
Okay.

706
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:50,505
All right. Well, I gotta...
I gotta run to the gym, Betty,

707
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:54,008
but, yeah, I sure am excited.

708
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:56,778
Betty, I'm really excited.

709
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:59,346
[chuckles] Me too. I'm like,
beyond excited.

710
00:38:10,525 --> 00:38:12,492
Hey, water-boy,
stay on the sidelines.

711
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:13,694
Court's for players only.

712
00:38:14,562 --> 00:38:15,863
Good.

713
00:38:15,897 --> 00:38:16,898
'Cause I'm here to play.

714
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:19,934
You can't just let him
on the team, Coach.

715
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:23,104
How do we even know
if he's any good?

716
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:24,005
[scoffs]

717
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:32,747
Any other questions?

718
00:38:34,215 --> 00:38:36,684
All right then,
let's keep warming up.

719
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:42,890
I'm not doing this for you,
Uncle Frank.

720
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:44,926
I'm doing this for myself.

721
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,795
And for my mom, and my dad.

722
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,665
I respect that, Archie.

723
00:38:53,901 --> 00:38:55,303
[Thornton] <i>Dr. Werthers,</i>

724
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:58,405
I confiscated this from
Dilton Doiley today.

725
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:02,844
It is like fighting a hydra,
Mrs. Thornton.

726
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:06,314
Cut off one head,
another grows in its place.

727
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:11,418
Yes, except this particular
head was written
by one of our students,

728
00:39:11,451 --> 00:39:12,787

-Betty.
