Okay.

169
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,810
Or you could treat me
to a milkshake after the show.

170
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,711
You just keep on shooting,
don't you?

171
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,146
You keep passing me the ball.

172
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,616
Okay, sure. Let's do it.

173
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:44,819

00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:46,487

-All right.

Guess who's got a date
with Reggie Mantle
tonight after the show?

179
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:03,170
That's swell, but Clay's
got a situation in
the projection booth.

180
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:07,808
I don't know what happened,
but the print we received
from the studio...

but we, the proud members
of the James Dean Fan Club
Riverdale Chapter,

205

You all got free passes,
including you, Cheryl.

206
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:28,088
True, but we did spend
all this money on
popcorn and soda

207

the double feature
which is no longer happening.

snack of your choosing...

211

We don't want
your stupid vouchers.

212

I'm so sorry.

As much as I'd be
delighted to split
a milkshake with you...

224

You've got a business
to take care of.

on by the most
gossamer of threads.

Okay.

I've never heard of
such a thing, Mr. Roth.

233
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:52,039
A venerated studio like yours,
sending out unplayable prints

234
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,907
of a major release
like <i>East of Eden?</i>

235
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,110
[Peter on phone]
<i>I'm as baffled as you,</i>
<i>Miss Lodge.</i>

236

At any rate, please accept
our deepest apologies
for this mishap.

237
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:02,316
I'll accept your apology,

238
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,486
but what I really want
is a pristine copy
of <i>East of Eden.</i>

239
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,123
And what I want
is audiences in Riverdale
to see this picture.

240
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,091
<i>I do. It's a wonderful picture.</i>

241
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,061
But I'm afraid that there
are no more available prints.

242
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,797
You sent me
a defective product.
How is this my problem?

243
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,198
Miss Lodge.

<i>Veronica.</i>
<i>May I call you Veronica?</i>

245
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:22,403
You're the theater owner.

246
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,038
It's always your problem.

247
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,073
You'd know that
if you weren't so green.

248

Green?

249
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:29,009
Let me assure you--

<i>I'm so sorry,</i>

I'm having lunch
at the Polo Lounge
with Monty Clift,

252
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:36,016
but good luck to you.

253
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,422
How does a major studio

254
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:44,659
run out of prints
of their biggest
release of the year?

255
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,460
I don't know.

256
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,063
But luckily, they're not
the only studio in town.

265

I'm hearing great things
about Hitchcock's latest.

266
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,861
Word around town
is that <i>Oklahoma!</i>
is a masterpiece.

[sighs] Well,
there you have it, boys.

284
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:08,208
I and the Babylonium have been
blacklisted by every
major studio in Hollywood.

285
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,309
Why, though?

286

hazard a guess,

288
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,150
I've been waiting
for this penny loafer to drop

289
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,886
since I bought the theater
out from under them.

290
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,920
My last call confirmed it,
but honestly,

291
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:24,458
I suspected sabotage
from the moment
we got that bad print.

292
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,761
What do your parents want?

293
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:29,196
To see everyone
but themselves fail,

294
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,365
including their own daughter.

295
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,601
I'm sure they want
the Babylonium to shutter

296
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:37,037
so they can buy it from me
at a discount
and turn it into a parking lot.

297
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,339
I have an idea.

298
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:42,476
So far, we've only tried
the major studios.

299
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,180
But there are a lot of smaller,
independent places out there.

300
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,883
They're scrappy,
and they don't play
by the same rules.

301
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:51,886
Their movies
don't have big stars
or budgets or prestige.

302
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,987
In other words,

303
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,990
they're B movies,
but they're still movies.

304
00:15:57,859 --> 00:15:59,460

335

with other people?

336
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,646
No, never. Just my diary.

337
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:00,113
Hmm.

338
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:04,953
What are you always writing
in that notepad of yours?

339
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:07,622
Notes, observations.

340
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:10,658
Thoughts to myself,
kind of like a diary.

341
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:16,531
Tell me, Betty.

342
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:22,036
Where do you think
this urge comes from?

343
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,974
The urge to be seen
in such a sexualized way.

344
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:29,309
Well, it must titillate you,
make it more exciting for you.

345
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:36,651
I don't think it's just
about being seen sexually.

346
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:44,859
I think it might be more about
being seen... period.

347
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:46,728
In what respect?

348
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:51,365
Being seen... as a person.

349
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:57,538
With autonomy, and desire...

350
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:01,274
and self-determination.

351
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:03,911
Go on.

352
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:09,117
I'm wondering if my interest
in understanding sex

353
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,452
is really more about
understanding myself.

354
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:15,657
Who I am.

355
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,029
I mean, what better way
to understand a person

356
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:23,430
than to understand
their desires?

357
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,567
Including your own.

358
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:31,572
-[bell dinging]
-[Pop] It'll just be
a few minutes.

359
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:32,573
Thanks, Pop.

360
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:45,053
Hey, Holden Caulfield.

361
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:49,090
Have you ever heard
of a movie called
<i>The Crawling Eye?</i>

362
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:51,726
Yeah. It came out
a couple years ago.

363
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,096
Uh, the story
was kind of a mess,
but the monster was cool.

364
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:56,329
I loved it. [chuckles]

365
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:58,800
Mr. Rayberry loved it too.

366
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:02,202
Why... Why do you ask?

367
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:08,810
Because after calling
every minor independent
studio in La La Land,

368
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:11,646
it's the only movie
I can get my hands on
to play at the Babylonium.

369
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,817
Why don't you just do
what William Castle did?

370
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,786
The name dimly rings a bell.

371
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,823
He's a producer-director.
His movies are just okay,

372
00:20:21,856 --> 00:20:24,125
but they all came with
a kind of gimmick.

373
00:20:24,158 --> 00:20:26,761
Like for <i>The Tingler,</i>
filmed in Percepto,

374
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:28,863
he put a bunch of buzzers
under the audience's seats

375
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,666
and when the monster,
the Tingler,
appeared on screen,

376
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:34,902
he would buzz
the people and give them
an electric shock. [chuckles]

377
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:36,403
That sounds dangerous.

378
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,305
It was just a mild shock,
but it worked.

379
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,774
People went nuts
for <i>The Tingler.</i>

380
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:41,943
[chuckles softly]

381
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:43,911
I get it.

382
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:46,413
Sell the gimmick,
not the movie.

383
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,851
I can do that.

384
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,389
[Alice] Oh, good. She's home.

385
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,960
Hello, dear.
So glad you're home.

386
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,431
What's going on?

387
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:09,237
You remember Reverend Lowe
from Riverdale First Reformed
Presbyterian Church?

388
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,940
My, how you've grown
since the children's choir,
Elizabeth.

[chuckles]

390
00:21:14,242 --> 00:21:15,610
He's going to
hear your confession

391
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:18,045
and perform an exorcism
if need be. Right?

392
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,614

What are you doing
with my diaries? Uh...

396
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:31,491
Did you read them?

397
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:34,095
Elizabeth, I had to.

398
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:35,428
They were prescribed to me.

399
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,232
By Dr. Werthers?

400
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:40,701
I would rather not say.

401
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:44,105
You... You broke into my room
and stole my diaries

402
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:47,340
because my psychiatrist
told you to?

403
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:49,476
Good grief, Mother!

404
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,981
I suspected you and Dr. Psycho
were talking about me,
but breaking and entering?

405
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:57,151
If you are so hot to trot
to talk with Dr. Werthers,

406
00:21:57,185 --> 00:22:00,353
why don't you come
to therapy with me?
It might help you.

of this book, <i>Lolita?</i>

Holy moly.

425
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:55,336

426
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,738
[clicks tongue]
I borrowed it from a friend.

427
00:23:57,772 --> 00:23:59,340
What can you tell me about it?

428
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:02,176
Well, it's Nabokov's
latest novel.

429
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:04,679
It's... pretty salacious,

430
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:06,614
according to the <i>Paris Review.</i>

431
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:08,649
It's about a relationship

432
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:10,418
between a professor
named Humbert Humbert

433
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,955
and a young girl
named Dolores Haze.

434
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:15,923
-How young?
-Twelve.

435
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:17,325
Twelve?

436
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:18,960
So it's a book for perverts?

437
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:20,695
Well...

438
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:23,130
passing moral judgment
on a work of art
is a slippery slope.

439
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,767
Have you read it yet?

440
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:29,737

No. It's not.

not press charges against you
for breaking into his office.

00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:51,145
That's good.

I'm sure she'll be down soon.

[Peter] <i>I was surprised</i>

671
00:37:58,613 --> 00:38:01,916
to read about your recent
box office success
in the trades.

672
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:04,152
I didn't even know
there was such a thing as 4D.

673
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:08,156
Yes, well, that's the kind
of business the Babylonium
is doing these days.

674
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:09,524
So I was curious

675
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:11,559
if you might want to
reconsider your decision

676
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:14,461
not to let us screen
any of your new releases.

677

[Peter] <i>Oh, I am sure we can</i>
<i>work something out.</i>

678
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:20,568
You know, I've always been
a fan of Riverdale.

679
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:22,670
Great town, superb audiences.

680
00:38:22,703 --> 00:38:26,207
It's like no place else,
Mr. Roth.

681
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,677
So we'll be getting
that print of <i>East of Eden</i>
for the weekend, I take it?

682
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,846
It's already heading your way.

683
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:34,148
Fab.

684
00:38:34,182 --> 00:38:37,952
Looking forward to a long,
fruitful collaboration, Peter.

685
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,754
Can I call you Peter?

686
00:38:39,787 --> 00:38:41,923

-Where's Reggie?
-He got tired of waiting.

689
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:48,529
He left those for you, though.

Smithers,

00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:16,224
there seems to be something
wrong with my lock.

693
00:39:16,257 --> 00:39:18,593
I'm afraid, Miss Veronica,
that the locks
have been changed.

694
00:39:18,626 --> 00:39:23,564
Your parents no longer feel
that you need or deserve
their financial support

695
00:39:23,598 --> 00:39:27,735
now that you're such
a roaring success.

696
00:39:27,768 --> 00:39:31,539
As soon as you have
a new address,
I'm to move your belongings.

00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:34,075
An eye for a crawling eye.

698
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:37,945
As for my address,
I already know
where I'll be staying.

699
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:39,379
In the short term, at least.
