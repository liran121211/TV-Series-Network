what Ralph Ellison did with</i> Invisible Man

73
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,112
is he took the broad idea
of existentialism

74
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:27,581
and applied it specifically
to the Black American experience.

75
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,005
Well, what struck me the most
was the novel's style.

a blight of calculated burlesque.

84
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,832

00:18:33,064 --> 00:18:37,954
and we fought more about that damn jalopy
than Cain and Abel did about sheep.

345
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:40,671
But come on, Archie.

346
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:42,426
The kid's far from home.

347
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:45,644
He's far from his family,
everything he knows.

348
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:48,069
He grew up scraping by,
working his ass off

349
00:18:48,152 --> 00:18:50,033
for things guys like us take for granted.

350
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,627
Can't you give him a break?

351
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:02,740
Well, how was the date? Worth the wait?

352
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,710
It was not stellar.

353
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:10,012
Archie was distracted the whole time.

354
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:12,311
How was it with you and Reggie?

355
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:14,568
Mixed.

356
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,616
Usually boys wanna go parking with me,

357
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:18,705
not cruising around town.

358
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:23,428
But straight from the fridge,
he, too, seemed preoccupied.

359
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:27,358
Kept glancing at his watch
like he had somewhere to go.

360
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,364
Hmm.

361
00:19:29,656 --> 00:19:32,958
Maybe we should switch dance partners
and try again?

362
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:35,425
Or maybe we try a double date.

363
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,015
I know just the event.

364
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,649
Have you heard
about this big concert in Centerville?

365
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:41,569
Mm-mm.

366
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:43,783
All the hipsters
and hepcats will be there.

367
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:47,043
What say we give our beaus
a chance to redeem themselves

368
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:49,886
for being such unlicked cubs?

369
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:54,358
[TABITHA]
Their words are so beautiful, Jughead.

370
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:57,869
Describing how their love endured
despite everything they went through.

371
00:19:57,952 --> 00:20:00,586
- What happened to them?
- From what I could piece together,

372
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:02,174
they got married in New York,

373
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:07,190
and then they moved to June's hometown
in South Carolina to start a family.

374
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,781
But there was an incident.

375
00:20:09,864 --> 00:20:11,955
Their lives were threatened.

376
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:13,835
Oh, jeez.

377
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:18,140
White thugs threw a brick
through their window.

378
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:20,899
Burned a cross in their yard.

379
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:24,243
They went to the police
who threatened to arrest them.

380
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:25,706
Not the thugs.

381
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,127
Them.

382
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:30,261
That's horrible.

383
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:34,357
I saw things like that every single day
I was on tour with Mrs. Till.

384
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,373
In any case, the Rayberrys were terrified.

385
00:20:39,457 --> 00:20:43,009
Not just for themselves,
but for the safety of June's family.

386
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:45,058
That's why Mr. Rayberry left.

387
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:46,812
And settled in Seaside. Yes.

388
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:49,446
I think the plan was
they were gonna save up enough money

389
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:51,870
to get June's family somewhere safe,

390
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:54,545
and then they were gonna go
live in Paris as expats.

391
00:20:56,008 --> 00:21:01,274
But if they had such a clear plan,
why would Mr. Rayberry take his own life?

392
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:04,535
Unless, as you keep saying...

393
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:06,582
he didn't.

394
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,820
- Reg, wait up.
- What, you find a dent in your fender?

395
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:19,456
Look, I'm sorry about last night.
I lost my cool.

396
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:24,765
In that case,
I'm sorry for miscounting the tromps.

397
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:27,314
What can I say? I'm car crazy.

398
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:28,400
It's a disease.

399
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:30,407
[VERONICA] Oh, fellas!

400
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,757
Better clear your dance cards.

401
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,351
Fangs is playing a concert in Centerville,
and we wanna go,

402
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:41,358
so you're taking us on a double date.

403
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:44,283
First to dinner, then to the show.
Any questions?

404
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:48,755
For some of you,
this was perhaps your first time

405
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,559
reading Wright's harrowing
and thought-provoking novel.

406
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:54,064
Of course, it was my third.

407
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:59,121
Now, I obviously have a lot of thoughts,
but I wanna hear from y'all first.

408
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,719
The book asks,
where does responsibility lie?

409
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:05,641
While Bigger does kill Mary,

410
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:08,275
the young white daughter
of the rich Dalton family,

411
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:12,914
the story in my mind
remains a cautionary tale about, well...

412
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,962
- The dangers of white ignorance.
- [CLAY] Exactly.

413
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:17,888
Wright doesn't give us any easy answers.

414
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:20,354
That's what's so great about it though.

415
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:24,074
He looks at society as a whole
and how it works to keep us oppressed.

416
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:25,954
Bigger commits murder,

417
00:22:26,456 --> 00:22:29,215
but his true crime
is stepping outside the box

418
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:31,012
that white society built around him.

419
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:33,645
I'll say it. Bigger was a stereotype.

420
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,152
Wright doesn't give him agency
to break the mold.

421
00:22:36,237 --> 00:22:38,243
James Baldwin would agree.

422
00:22:38,326 --> 00:22:40,416
And all roads lead to Baldwin.
Right, Clay?

423
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,586
[ALL CHUCKLING]

424
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:43,174
They do, Kev.

425
00:22:43,844 --> 00:22:46,518
Cheryl, do you have anything to add?

426
00:22:47,354 --> 00:22:48,817
Oh, no.

427
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,501
Um...

428
00:22:55,254 --> 00:23:00,312
Only that this was
the most powerful novel I've ever read.

429
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:05,996
And that the family in the book,
the Daltons...

430
00:23:08,044 --> 00:23:10,133
reminded me a lot of my own family.

431
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:13,017
In some unpleasant ways.

432
00:23:14,898 --> 00:23:19,831
But I'm very glad to have read it
and to be learning more about it.

433
00:23:20,582 --> 00:23:22,045
[JEREMY] Just out of curiosity,

434
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:25,222
is <i>Native Son</i> the only novel
by a Black author that you've ever read?

435
00:23:27,814 --> 00:23:31,449
Yes, but I can't wait to read more.

436
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,247
You won't be shocked to hear, Cheryl,

437
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,967
that I maintain an ever-evolving syllabus
of Black authors I believe everyone,

438
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,147
regardless of who they are
or where they're from, should be reading.

439
00:23:41,648 --> 00:23:44,867
I gave it to Kevin.
I'd be jazzed to share it with you.

440
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,333
- Thank you, Clay.
- Of course.

441
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,859
Now, moving on to Baldwin's essay...

442
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:58,408
[KELLER] <i>Let me get this straight.</i>

443
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:03,341
In your expert opinion,
Brad Rayberry didn't kill himself?

444
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:04,804
No.

445
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,439
What happened to him then?

446
00:24:09,903 --> 00:24:11,533
Well, to put a fine point on it,

447
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,336
disguising murder as suicide
has been a gimmick in detective fiction

448
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,844
since the days of Arthur Conan Doyle.

449
00:24:17,927 --> 00:24:21,439
Let me ask you this.
How well did you really know

450
00:24:21,522 --> 00:24:23,946
your so-called hero, Jughead?

451
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,952
Well enough to know
he wouldn't take his own life.

452
00:24:26,037 --> 00:24:27,081
Uh-huh.

453
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,297
Did you also know that he was

454
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,470
a card-carrying member
of the Communist Party?

455
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,891
[SCOFFS]

456
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,237
How about the fact
that he was a draft dodger

457
00:24:37,321 --> 00:24:39,871
who protested the Korean War?

458
00:24:39,954 --> 00:24:41,710
That he was a dope fiend?

459
00:24:42,253 --> 00:24:46,935
Spent a month as a mental patient
at St. Vincent's in New York City.

460
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:55,378
This...

461
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:57,551
This is impossible.

462
00:24:57,634 --> 00:24:59,390
Now, I'm no headshrinker,

463
00:24:59,473 --> 00:25:04,280
but if you ask me,
someone who's got that many secrets...

464
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:09,504
well, it's a miracle
that he didn't take his own life sooner.

465
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,136
I'm curious to hear
how you thought the meeting went.

466
00:25:25,722 --> 00:25:28,648
Better than I thought it would, actually.

467
00:25:28,731 --> 00:25:29,776
I'm relieved.

468
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,872
I was worried people would feel
uncomfortable around you,

469
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:38,135
or that you would feel uncomfortable
around my friends.

470
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:43,443
They were, and I was.

471
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:46,411
Not so much uncomfortable as I was worried

472
00:25:46,495 --> 00:25:50,047
that I wasn't going to say
the right thing at first, but then...

473
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,513
But then everyone settled in nicely.

474
00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:55,188
It was really nice to have you here.

475
00:25:55,898 --> 00:25:56,944
It was.

476
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:01,625
But I think you were right to be
so protective of Black Athena.

477
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:04,300
It's your club, your space.

478
00:26:04,383 --> 00:26:07,225
I am so grateful
that I got to experience it

479
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,486
and that I got to see firsthand
what you're so passionate about.

480
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,701
But I think in the future,

481
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:15,335
I will just attend the more public events.

482
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:21,269
Well, we are hosting an open mic night
at the Dark Room next month.

483
00:26:21,353 --> 00:26:22,942
I will be there, front row.

484
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:26,452
And maybe you can read
some more books off Clay's list.

485
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:27,873
Absolutely.

486
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:33,014
And maybe afterward,
we could discuss them together.

487
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:35,857
Well, I can dig that plan.

488
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:45,637
Also, what are you doing tonight?

489
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:49,064
Midge had mentioned
that there was a concert in Centerville.

490
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,196
Would you wanna go?

491
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:57,256
I am certain
I could make myself available.

492
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:09,001
[JUNE] This is the last letter
I received from Bradley.

493
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:12,512
Given the date,
he must have mailed it right before...

494
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:14,979
his passing.

495
00:27:18,447 --> 00:27:22,293
In it, he wrote about finally
wanting to have his novel published.

496
00:27:22,836 --> 00:27:25,135
He did? Really?

497
00:27:28,185 --> 00:27:31,362
"If a publisher takes it,
we'll at last have the money we need

498
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:35,166
to buy your parents a place in the city
and move to Paris.

499
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:37,632
After everything we've been through,

500
00:27:37,716 --> 00:27:40,892
I'm filled with such optimism
about our future."

501
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:45,323
Now, I'm not a detective like Miss Marple,

502
00:27:45,406 --> 00:27:48,499
but that doesn't sound like
a man planning to take his life.

503
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,506
No. It sure doesn't.

504
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:55,019
Mrs. Simpson, Sheriff Keller told me
some things about your husband.

505
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,617
That he was a war protester,
and a communist.

506
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:04,215
And that he'd been to... an asylum?

507
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,057
Mm-hm.

508
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,272
And that's true.

509
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:13,452
But did he also tell you
that Bradley served in World War II,

510
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:17,548
and that he became addicted to opium
because of a war injury,

511
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:22,647
and that he checked himself
into St. Vincent's voluntarily?

512
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:26,952
And, yes, he attended
a couple of communist meetings

513
00:28:27,036 --> 00:28:30,045
when he was young, and curious,
