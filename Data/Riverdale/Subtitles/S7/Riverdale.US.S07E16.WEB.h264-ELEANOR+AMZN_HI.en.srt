{\an8}Sorry to be calling you so late,
but we need to talk.

{\an8}- He didn't pass it to you. He was...
- So last night was a bust.

176
00:09:28,754 --> 00:09:30,339
{\an8}Tell you what, though.

177
00:09:30,423 --> 00:09:32,634
{\an8}I got Keller and Walker
to lend me a projector,

178
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:36,097
{\an8}and I watched another movie I got
from my buddy at Stonewall Prep

179
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:37,515
{\an8}after Cooper shut us down.

180
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:39,518
And, guys...

181
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:43,148
{\an8}it's like the 10th wonder of the world.
Mm.

182
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:46,152
And guess what, for two bucks,

183
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,321
I'll rent you the projector and the movie,

184
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:50,824
{\an8}which you can watch
in the privacy of your own home.

185
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:53,036
{\an8}This time, with no interruptions.

186
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:55,414
What do you say, boys?

187
00:09:56,373 --> 00:09:59,628
[VERONICA]
Okay, so you and Polly actually spoke?

188
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:02,798
{\an8}Yes, but it was quick.
She's on her way to Riverdale now.

189
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:05,802
{\an8}We're gonna meet at Pop's
so she can explain everything to me.

190
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:07,888
{\an8}But she says she doesn't do
those films anymore.

191
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:11,726
- Right, she's on Broadway.
- No, actually, that's her cover story.

192
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:16,858
{\an8}What she told me last night is,
she does... [WHISPERS] burlesque.

193
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:18,694
Really?

194
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:23,033
{\an8}- Do your parents know that?
- Apparently.

195
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:24,952
{\an8}I didn't ask them this morning.

196
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:27,372
{\an8}They don't even know
that I reached out to Polly.

197
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,126
{\an8}Well, for what it's worth,
burlesque is a legit art form.

198
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:35,006
{\an8}In fact,
some burlesque performers are huge stars.

199
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,762
{\an8}Gypsy Rose Lee, to name one.
Josephine Baker, to name another.

200
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:41,933
{\an8}Well, she says her stage name
is Polly Amorous.

201
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,852
{\an8}Cut the gas.

202
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,984
Polly Amorous?
Betty, she's the berries. I'm gonna flip.

203
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:51,569
{\an8}What? Have you seen her perform?

204
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,030
{\an8}No, I wish.

205
00:10:53,114 --> 00:10:55,367
{\an8}But I recognize that name from the trades.

206
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,579
I always thought she sounded
so glamorous and flossy.

207
00:10:58,663 --> 00:11:02,543
{\an8}I mean, I'd flat out die and go to heaven
to have her perform at the Babylonium.

208
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,464
- She kind of already did.
- Her burlesque show, you tickler.

209
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:08,425
Say, come to think of it,

210
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:12,681
{\an8}maybe this is why
your mom is so terrified of S-E-X.

211
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,476
{\an8}Maybe she's threatened by Polly.

212
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:20,065
{\an8}Her independence, her sexuality,
her devil-may-care ways.

213
00:11:24,863 --> 00:11:25,990
{\an8}Well, hi-de-ho.

214
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:28,910
{\an8}I must say, it's official,
you're a genius.

215
00:11:28,994 --> 00:11:30,662
Photography is no big whoop

216
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:33,666
{\an8}when you have subjects
as stunning as, well, us.

217
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:38,255
By the way, I was reading
the back pages of <i>Femme-And-In</i>,

218
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:42,470
and they publish amateur photos,
if that's something you're interested in.

219
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:46,183
Perhaps after we graduate high school?

220
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:50,396
In the meantime, how do you feel
about me painting a version of this?

221
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,274
That's my favorite one too.

222
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,361
I can't wait to see how you pulpify us.

223
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:58,323
[JUGHEAD] I know how you feel
about comic books, Veronica.

224
00:11:58,406 --> 00:12:01,035
But I also know
that you're the top negotiator in town.

225
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:04,790
And though I'm not necessarily
a fanatic of comic books,

226
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:08,002
I don't think
they should be burned or banned.

227
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:09,797
But this code...

228
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,218
Yeah. Mr. Fieldstone got us a copy
ahead of the meeting.

229
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:17,139
What that crackpot Werthers
is proposing is insane.

230
00:12:17,223 --> 00:12:20,519
I mean, it is straight out of <i>1984.</i>

231
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:23,523
Big Brother is watching,
and he's trying to take your comic books.

232
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:26,485
These rules are more outrageous
than the Hays Code.

233
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:30,865
How can you possible spin any yarn
with all these blanket restrictions?

234
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:34,495
Heck, he's even trying to ban the words
"horror" and "terror" from our covers.

235
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:37,040
And some of these rules
are incredibly vague.

236
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:41,963
Werthers wants to outlaw stories
with horror, bloodshed, depravity, lust,

237
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:44,299
but he doesn't define
what those terms mean.

238
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:47,846
I think he's trying
to specifically target Pep Comics.

239
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:51,642
If he gets his way, the good doctor
is going to run us out of business.

240
00:12:51,725 --> 00:12:54,563
So you came to me. Smart.

241
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:58,861
Well, first, don't get the gringles.

242
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:02,365
If they smell fear,
they will pounce on you.

243
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,662
Technically, this isn't a code.

244
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,374
It's a proposal. Their first offer.

245
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:13,588
So you and Mr. Fieldstone
should make a counterproposal.

246
00:13:14,213 --> 00:13:16,884
Go through this draft, point by point.

247
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:19,179
Be crystal clear about what you want.

248
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:21,598
Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

249
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:25,520
You're in the right on this one, Jughead.
Don't doubt yourself.

250
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,738
It's really nice to see you again, Polly.
I missed you.

251
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:34,489
Oh, I missed you too, Betty.

252
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:38,328
I'm sorry that we're reconnecting
under these circumstances.

253
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:42,542
Oh, I figured you'd want this back.

254
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:44,711
Yes. Thank you.

255
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:46,505
Can I ask?

256
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:49,176
Why did you do it, Polly?

257
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:50,427
[SIGHS]

258
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,348
I got hoodwinked
into filming <i>The Wedding Night</i>

259
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:55,308
when I first got to New York.

260
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:56,894
I was young and naïve,

261
00:13:56,977 --> 00:14:00,607
and fell in love with a fink
who steered me wrong.

262
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,237
I spent a year trying to track down
every copy I could find.

263
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,697
Thought I got them all.

264
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:08,575
Well, how did you get into burlesque?

265
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:11,496
It's funny.
Um, I auditioned for the Rockettes,

266
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,082
but I wasn't tall enough.

267
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:18,881
And then I saw Gypsy Rose Lee
perform at the <i>Ziegfeld Follies</i>

268
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:21,551
and I thought, "That is what I wanna do."

269
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:24,471
And whatever you might think
about burlesque,

270
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:26,182
I'm proud of my career.

271
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:31,063
It's on my terms, I make good money,
people respect me, and I respect myself.

272
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:32,983
So you don't have to worry.

273
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:35,443
I wanted to tell you that, face-to-face.

274
00:14:35,528 --> 00:14:37,989
I'm so happy for you, Polly, really.

275
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:42,119
And to be perfectly honest,

276
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:47,126
I did a little burlesque show of my own.

277
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:49,671
Just for one person. Archie.

278
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:51,172
Archie from next door?

279
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:52,550
In our windows.

280
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:54,927
Well, you always were sweet on him.

281
00:14:57,055 --> 00:15:01,019
How much did you say
Mom and Dad know about...?

282
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:02,396
My life?

283
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:06,693
Well, they don't know
about <i>The Wedding Night,</i> thank God,

284
00:15:06,776 --> 00:15:09,113
but they do know about Polly Amorous.

285
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:11,949
I invited them to my show
a couple of years ago.

286
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:15,872
They walked out in the first five minutes
without saying a word. Not a peep.

287
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:19,460
Then I started hearing that mom was
telling people I was doing <i>Guys and Dolls,</i>

288
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,797
and I thought, well, that is it for me.

289
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,132
In their eyes, at least.

290
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,342
But it's fine.

291
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,094
I'm past that, truly.

292
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:29,139
I came here for you, Betty.

293
00:15:29,222 --> 00:15:31,725
And I booked a room at the Cozy Time Motel

294
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:34,687
'cause I figured Mom and Dad
have no interest in seeing me.

295
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:38,233
Anyways, I don't wanna step foot
in that house ever again.

296
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:41,946
I understand. Believe me.

297
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,867
But I thought we could do
something fun tonight.

298
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:48,372
Go shopping or to the movies.
My treat, of course.

00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:51,084
Well, actually,
if you're not rushing back to the city,

300
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:54,963
I was wondering if you might be willing
to meet a friend of mine.

301
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:57,258
She's a big fan of yours.

302
00:15:57,342 --> 00:15:59,762

303
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:01,889

00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:05,060
Absolutely. I never say no to a fan.

from my all-expenses-paid,

- Polly, you're going to Europe?
- Mm-hm.

00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:35,511
What do you think about doing
a one-night-only show

334
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:37,388
at my theater, the Babylonium?

335
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:40,643
I know Betty would love
to see you perform, as would I.

336
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,272
It's true. And maybe Mom would even come
since it's right here in town.

337
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,150
I wouldn't hold your breath
on that, Betty.

338
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:50,531
But as a matter of fact,
I am working on a new routine.

339
00:17:51,406 --> 00:17:52,867
Well, then it's kismet.

340
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:55,871
And we'll keep it on the hush-hush.
Girls only.

[GROANS]

342
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,677
This is gonna be
the best $2 we've ever spent.

343
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,473
I'll say. Tonight, we become men.

344
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:18,567
- You ready?
- Yeah.

345
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,637
What, uh...? [CLEARS THROAT] What is this?

346
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:44,350
Don't know. Maybe they'll fight
over a girl or something.

347
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:46,645
- Right. Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

348
00:18:54,572 --> 00:18:55,908

349
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,289
That joker Julian
must've switched films on us as a gag.

350
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:02,373
Yeah.

351
00:19:02,457 --> 00:19:06,922
Didn't Julian say something about
Kevin and Clay watching wrestling videos?

352
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:09,842
I don't know, but we should probably
turn this off, right? I mean...

353
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:13,180
Yeah. Yeah, we probably should.

[UNCOMFORTABLE MUSIC PLAYING]

355
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:30,702
Maybe we just give it a minute
just to see if a girl comes in.

356
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:34,332
Yeah, that's a good idea. Let's do that.

357
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,029
Hey, that was wacko, right?

358
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:07,625
You think the guys in that movie were...
you know?

359
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:11,755
Well, some guys are that way.

360
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:14,426
Yeah, so...

361
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,013
Are Kevin and Clay?

362
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:18,139
I think.

363
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,187
Yeah. Maybe.

364
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:24,939
And, you know, there's an in-between.

365
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,863
What do you mean an in-between?

366
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:33,325
Like a little wiggle room to... explore.

367
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,415
We've been talking about it
in Mrs. Grundy's workshop.

You even wanna ban the word "mystery"

Mr. Fieldstone, as an educator,

441
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:14,863
I believe this code
to be quite even-handed.

442
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:18,034
Well, I believe it
to be intentionally vague and confusing

- [JUGHEAD] No, we are not done here.

00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:36,307
- A rating system?
- [FIELDSTONE] Yes.

Printed clearly on our covers.

00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:43,567
A comic might be rated K for "kid"
or T for "teen" or A for "adult."

Don't be so naïve.

Stamping an A for "adult" on a comic book

454
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:50,826
would only make it
more desirable for young readers.

we wrap this up, don't you concur?

Wrap it up? We haven't even begun
to reach a compromise.

468
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:34,424
This meeting was never a negotiation.

469
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:36,719
It was offered to you as a courtesy.

470
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:38,763
All of your competitors

Not even <i>Super Duck.</i>

Which means that no newsstand in America
will sell or even carry your comic books.

479
00:26:02,752 --> 00:26:05,548
They will be relegated to the trash heap.

00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,385
Where they belong.

481
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:15,519
I know it's been a busy week,

482
00:26:15,603 --> 00:26:17,606
but did you all have
a chance to read "Howl"?

483
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,152
Good, let's open it up for discussion.

484
00:26:21,235 --> 00:26:22,737
What did you all think?

485
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,032
Dynamic and hallucinogenic.

486
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:28,703
A subterranean toppling of idolatry,
and an awakening.

487
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,790
Very good, Clay. Archie.

488
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,586
What did you think of Ginsberg's poem?

489
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:35,754
I...

490
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,927
couldn't sleep after reading it.

491
00:26:41,803 --> 00:26:44,057
Where does a humdinger like "Howl"
even come from?

492
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,810
Well, Allen's lived a lot of life.

493
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:52,067
My husband says you can't be a real poet
without really living.

494
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,569
Well, in that case...

495
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,032
I'm never gonna be able
to write anything like "Howl."

496
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,076
Why would you say that, Archie?

497
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,745
Because look at me, Mrs. Grundy.

498
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,122
I'm a square. What am I gonna write about?

499
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:06,043
Jack Kerouac played football
in small-town Massachusetts

500
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,630
before going to Columbia to study writing.

501
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:12,093
Maybe it's more about
keeping an open mind about things.

502
00:27:12,176 --> 00:27:17,350
Being open to trying new things
with different people.

503
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:21,146

That's more
than any one of us here can say.

682
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:18,750
Don't pick a fight with me, Elizabeth.
I'm not in the mood.

683
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:21,045
So when are you going to stop?

684
00:38:22,964 --> 00:38:25,592
Stop sabotaging our family?

685

- Oh, is that what you think I'm doing?
- Isn't it?

686
00:38:27,846 --> 00:38:31,976
Did you forget
when you disowned me as your daughter?

687
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,479
You drove Polly away.

688
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:38,067
We couldn't even have one night together,
the three of us,

689
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:39,652
because of your hang-ups.

690
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:44,367
You know what?
You are a sad, lonely woman.

691
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:46,744
And it is all your own doing.

692
00:38:46,828 --> 00:38:48,038
But I'll tell you this, Mom.

693
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:50,791
I am not giving you
any more power over my life

694
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,794
because you will ruin it.

695
00:38:52,878 --> 00:38:54,881
I'm going to do exactly what Polly did,

696
00:38:54,964 --> 00:38:57,425
and the second I can leave this town,
I'm gone.

697
00:38:57,508 --> 00:38:58,844
Fine.

698
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:00,053
Go!

699
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,014
Oh.

700
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:03,266
You should know, after last night,

701
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:05,102
I'm thinking of following
in Polly's footsteps

702
00:39:05,186 --> 00:39:06,896
and becoming a burlesque dancer too.

703
00:39:06,979 --> 00:39:09,983
Except maybe I'll take off all my clothes.

704
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:11,819
And then what will you tell your friends?

705
00:39:11,903 --> 00:39:14,406
Or will you just pretend
that I don't exist

706
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,033
or that I died tragically?

707
00:39:16,116 --> 00:39:17,619
- Elizabeth...
- It doesn't matter.

708
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:20,914
Because I won't be in this house.
I'll be far away from you,

709
00:39:20,998 --> 00:39:24,001
doing whatever I want,
and you can't stop me.

it took you this long to do that.

00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,919
[VERONICA] So, what happens now?

714
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,384
Well, if we don't follow their code,

715
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:04,388
we can't publish our comics
with their seal of approval.

716
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:08,268
And if we can't get that,
then publishers won't print our comics,

717
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:12,106
distributors will not ship them,
and newsstands will not sell them.

718
00:40:12,189 --> 00:40:17,905
So we either follow their cockeyed rules
or we go the way of the dodos.

719
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:22,202
How can I have been so naïve?

720
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:28,377
I really thought
that there was a way through this.

721
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,838
You weren't naïve, Jughead.

722
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:34,009
You were fighting for what's right.

723
