00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,152
I'm not as good as your daughter,
Mr. Lodge.

170
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,947
I can't... run multiple businesses
and do well in school

171
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,575
and everything else Veronica's so good at.

172
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,994
If you're talking about this place
and Andrews Construction,

173
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,913
-have you thought about shedding one?
-Yeah.

174
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,667
But my Grandpa Artie founded
Andrews Construction

175
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,044
and passed it down to my dad.

176
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,545
It's my legacy.

177
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,758
Well, both of your businesses bear
your father's name.

178
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,719
You'll be keeping his legacy alive,
no matter what.

179
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,932
[Archie]
Thanks for meeting with me, Mr. Keller.

180
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,685
Yeah, of course, Archie.
So, what's been going on?

181
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,687
Truthfully, a lot.

182
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,357
I've been thinking about the future
of Andrews Construction

183
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,317
and the community center recently.

184
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,570
Vic has offered to buy
Andrews Construction a few times.

185
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,615
I don't like the guy, personally,
but my dad did.

186
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,534
If I sold it, I could use that money
to pay you a proper salary

187
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,078
to help me run the center full-time.

188
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,538
If that's something
you'd be interested in.

189
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,335
Well, I've been hopping from job to job
since I lost my post as sheriff.

190
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,671
A more permanent gig
would be a nice change of pace.

191
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,632
I'd like that, Arch.

192
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,597
Does anyone know why DuPont summoned us?

193
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,349
No need to wonder, Ms. Berkeley.

194
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,101
I will tell you.

195
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:32,024
The headmaster has just given me
some very unsettling news.

196
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,903
One of you has been accused
of the worst crime a writer can commit.

197
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,196
Plagiarism.

198
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,241
Mr. Jones,

199
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,953
it seems that the short story
that qualified you for Yale,

200
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,621
"On Featherless Wings,"

201
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,666
was in fact written by another student.

202
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,584
In this seminar.

203
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,504
Let me guess who accused me. Was it Bret?

204
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,005
No. It was me.

205
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,051
-What? Why?
-Because I wrote "On Featherless Wings."

206
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,845
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

207
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:06,350
And I've got a time stamp on my computer
proving that I wrote it two months ago.

208
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,561
I wrote it during the summer.
It's on my computer.

209
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,481
The story you wrote last summer is
on the laptop I gave you three weeks ago?

210
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,651
No, it's on my old one. It's in my room.
Can I get it, please?

211
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,736
Go and get it. We shall wait.

212
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,536
What the hell?

213
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,466
Jones, so, where's this magical,
exonerating laptop?

214
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,384
It's not in there
because someone stole it.

215
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,636
That seems rather convenient.

216
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,890
Mr. DuPont, I'm going to fight
these accusations tooth and nail.

217
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,725
You had better.

218
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:53,397
Stonewall Prep takes the crime
of plagiarism very seriously.

219
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:58,402
As such, you will go before the headmaster
and disciplinary committee on Friday.

220
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,947
On the Ides of March,

221
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,532
fittingly enough.

222
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,372
Mr. DuPont's turning out to be worse
than any villain

223
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,750
in his precious Baxter Brothers series.

224
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,668
It's clear he wants me expelled.

225
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,297
You can't let your name be tarnished
by these trust-fund brats.

226
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,634
Hell, it's my name. It's our family name.

227
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,804
If I let my reputation be destroyed
by a baseless accusation,

228
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,641
my career as a writer is going to be over
before it even begins.

229
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,018
There's no way that's happening, Jug.

230
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,523
I think I have an idea.

231
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,234
[Kevin sighs] <i>That test was brutal.</i>

232
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,362
Why does anybody need to know
what primogeniture is?

233
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,490
-Wait, that was one of the questions?
-[snaps fingers]

234
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,407
Ms. Lodge.

235
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,954
During a routine search, I found
this flask of rum in your locker.

236
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,247
Excuse me.

237
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:55,751
When did Riverdale High become a fascist
police state, Principal Mussolini?

238
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:00,047
It is my responsibility to look after
my students' well-being.

239
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,302
How do you think Barnard will react
when they hear about this incident?

240
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,681
The recruiter already saw me drinking
at my speakeasy.

241
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,684
They're not a bunch of prissy,
power-tripping asshats.

242
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,979
Stop. You don't have to do this.
You don't have to protect me.

244
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,901
Principal Honey, I'm so sorry.

245
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,654
The lock on my locker broke,
and I know Veronica's combination...

246
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,950
so I stashed that flask, my flask,
in there before the test.

247
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,039
So, this is your liquor, Mr. Andrews?

248
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:38,085
It's been a rough year, sir, as you know.
Sometimes I need to take the edge off.

249
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,379

-Exactly.
-Jones.

257
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,541
And, Betty, to what do we owe
the pleasure?

258
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,462
We know Jonathan's lying
about writing "On Featherless Wings."

259
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,548
And we know that one
or all of you stole my laptop

260
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,300
and are conspiring against me.

261
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,470
-So, we're here to prove it.
-With a lie detector test?

262
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:35,309
[laughs] Okay, well, I refuse
to participate in this charade.

263
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,226
Fine.

264
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,064
Then you all can watch
while Jughead takes the test.

Is your name Forsythe Pendleton Jones III?

Yes.

267
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,950
When did you start writing
"On Featherless Wings"?

268
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,370
At the end of last summer,
before I'd even heard of Stonewall Prep.

269
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,290
Did you get rid of your old laptop because
it contained incriminating evidence?

270
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,501
Of course not. It was stolen.

271
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,546
And what, exactly,
do you think this is proving?

272
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,633
Well, Jonathan's guilt,

273
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,635
by process of elimination.

274
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,971
I hate to break it to you, sweetie,

275
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,307
but this isn't gonna prove
Jughead's innocence.

276
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,228
Do you think I don't know that, bitch?

277
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,816
This lie detector test is only
the beginning.

Once we're done

-Hey, handsome.
-What are you doing here?

336
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,533
An ambush.

337
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,869
And they say journalism is a dying art.

338
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,747
I marked you as soon as I saw you
at La Bonne Nuit.

339
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,960
How dare you try and seduce my dear
Tee-Tee like she's some backwater fool.

340
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,882
As if Cheryl and Toni would expose you
to the Maple Club, our rum operation?

341
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,801
I have no idea
what you're talking about, <i>hermana.</i>

342
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,973
The gall you have coming into town,
trying to ruin our business,

343
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,808
my livelihood.

344
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,730
I bet Daddy put you up to this, didn't he?

345
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,151
Do a little recon.
Scope out the competition.

346
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,030
I don't know what he's told you
about his condition.

347
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,573
Everything.

348
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,494
He also told me you didn't know.

349
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,832
He told you?

350
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,378
And not me?

351
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,173
He trusted you?

352
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,385
And not me?

353
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,970
Can you blame him?

354
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,809
[Veronica grunts]

355
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,735
[softly] All right, let's hurry up.

356
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,530
Donna and Joan were in film studies,
but they could be back any moment.

357
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,080
I never should have taken that laptop
from Bret.

358
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,165
We'll get it back, Jug.

359
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,960
You take Joan's side, I'll take Donna's.

360
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,129
[Jughead] "Ready for print"?

361
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,888
{\an8}<i>The Boy in the River?</i>

362
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:33,393
This is the novel that I submitted to win
the Baxter Brothers contract.

363
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,771
-About Jason Blossom?
-Yeah.

364
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,940
DuPont told me that
the Baxter Brotherhood rejected it

365
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,651
because it wasn't dark
or sociopathic enough.

366
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,700
It's definitely been rewritten.

367
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,953
But this is my book.

368
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,793
-What do you wanna do?
-Well, the only thing we can do.

369
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,797
I thought the Brotherhood didn't want
my novel.

370
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,966
-We didn't and we don't.
-Then, what the hell is this?

371
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,260
You really think I wouldn't recognize
my own story

372
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,054
after someone did a polish on it?

373
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:13,141
Ah, you should have had a lawyer take
a much closer look at your contract.

374
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,895
You see, the Brotherhood owns
everything you submit.

375
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,438
We kept the elements we liked

376
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,441
and then let another ghostwriter try
their hand at it.

377
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,860
Oh, yeah? Who?

378
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,905
[chuckles] Well, actually,

379
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:30,075
all of your classmates collaborated on it.

380
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,622
[knock on door]

381
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,584
Archie, what are you doing here?

382
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,545
I came to make sure you're okay.

383
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,839
I'm worried about you, Veronica.

384
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,719
What are you doing?

385
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:53,181
Drinking at school?
Acting like this crazy party girl?

386
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,185
You're pushing people away.
Tell me what's really going on.

387
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,317
He's dying, Archie.

388
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,194
-Who is?
-[sobbing] My dad.

389
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,991
He's been diagnosed
with a debilitating disease...

390
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:16,997
and I don't know what to do.
I feel... completely lost.

391
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,833
[continues sobbing]

392
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,170
I'm sorry, Veronica.

393
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,302
I know there's not much that I can say...

394
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,517
but one of the worst parts
about my dad dying...

395
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,979
was that I was never able to say goodbye.

396
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,690
Even in the months before.

397
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,818
I didn't know
what little time we had left,

398
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,820
and I regret not spending
more of it with him.

399
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:56,286
I don't know if I can sit by
and watch him waste away to nothing.

400
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,662
I don't want to see that.

401
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,124
Veronica, you're the strongest person
that I know.

402
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,169
And right now you have to give
some of that strength to your dad.

403
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,089
You know better than anyone
how to get him fired up.

404
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,508
That's what he needs.

405
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,734
Happy Friday, you soul-sucking vampires.

406
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,903
Good morning to you, too, <i>mija.</i>

407
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,572
Before you crawl back into your coffins
for the day,

408
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,033
I've got a little presentation
I've been working on.

409
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,494
Red Raven's newest ad campaign.

410
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,622
[Veronica clears throat]

411
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,252
Consumers are now more interested
in quality than name brands,

412
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,004
which is why we conducted
a blind taste test,

413
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:52,968
in which nine out of ten test subjects
picked Red Raven Rum

414
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,221
over the competitors Lodge Rum
and Lodge Spiced Rum.

415
00:25:56,304 --> 00:26:00,100
As we like to say at Red Raven,
"Quality always."

416
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,518
And this is only the first wave.

417
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,479
We'll run print ads
in the <i>Riverdale Register</i>,

418
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:08,024
the <i>Greendale Gazette</i>
and the <i>Seaside Sentinel</i> to start.

419
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:13,405
<i>Mija, </i>do you really think
you'll get the upper hand?

420
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,322
Over me?

421
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,492
You're a little specialty brand.

422
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,327
Oh, haven't you heard?

423
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:23,081
Cheryl's already begun renovations
on her family's maple factory.

424
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,544
We'll be producing 300 percent
more maple rum by the end of the year.

425
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,759
Well, then I only have
one thing left to say.

426
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,847
-Congratulations, <i>mija.</i>
-Hmm.

427
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:46,104
You have successfully awoken the dragon.

428
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,400
Prepare to be eaten.

429
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,032
What is wrong with you?

430
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,118
Why would you intentionally provoke him?
You know how ill he is.

431
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,079
In times like these, family members
should be supporting each other,

432
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,831
not antagonizing one another.

433
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,667
Seems to me that Daddy's doing just fine.

434
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,794
Just one minor ad campaign

435
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,339
and he's more fired up
than he's been in days.

436
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,676
So don't for a second think
you understand Daddy better than me.

437
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,679
If anybody is going to save Daddy
from this crippling disease,

438
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:20,930
it's going to be me...

439
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,016
Veronica Lodge.

440
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,520
Now stand back and watch, ladies.
You might learn something.

441
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,361
[Betty] I've been thinking
about Mr. Chipping's tie pin, Jug.

442
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,655
And how Donna had it. It doesn't add up.

443
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,076
If the affair with Chipping was just
another one of Donna's fabricated stories,

444
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,327
then how did she get it?

445
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,414
Let's assume that someone else took
Mr. Chipping's tie pin.

446
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,416
Someone like Mr. DuPont?

447
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,377
{\an8}Exactly.

448
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,130
{\an8}It's possible he gave it to Donna
to add credibility to her story

449
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,924
{\an8}about them having an affair.

450
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,720
Then she would have the tie pin
and the story of the affair at the ready

451
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,597
in case anyone got too close to the truth.

452
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,935
Hmm. That Mr. Chipping was driven
to suicide by Mr. DuPont.

453
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,147
{\an8}[Betty] It's a theory, by any rate.

454
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,777
<i>I wanted to clear the air</i>
<i>between us, Donna.</i>

455
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,907
And hopefully resolve
this whole Jughead witch-hunt thing.

456
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,951
Just the two of us.

457
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,583
See, I think that you and Bret,
Joan and Jonathan...

458
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,545
are just pawns

459
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:38,383
being manipulated by Mr. DuPont,
who I think is the real villain here.

460
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,676
I'm intrigued.

461
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,594
Go on.

462
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,764
I don't think you had an affair
with Chipping.

463
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,558
["I Can't Bring Myself To Smile" playing]

464
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:50,019
If I'm right and you didn't

465
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,940
and DuPont somehow put you up
to saying that you did...

466
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,609
I implore you...

467
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,154
come forward.

468
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:04,617
Don't let yourself be a victim
of his machinations, Donna.

469
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,624
You think you're close to the truth,
don't you?

470
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,877
You and Jughead, teen detectives?

471
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:16,921
Are we?

472
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,965
I guess we'll see.

473
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,809
[Bret] <i>Still working on that book, huh?</i>

474
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,728
Hm. Well...

475
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:37,317
I do hope you enjoy your last night
in this room.

476
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,695
You are so smug, it just hurts, Bret.

477
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,781
You don't know what I'm going to say
at the tribunal,

478
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,825
but I promise you, it's not just going
to be about some short story

479
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,535
I didn't plagiarize, Bret.

480
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,830
It's going to be about everything
that is going on here.

481
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:55,293
It's going to be about Chipping,
and Moose, and Quill and Skull,

482
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,711
and about my novel.

483
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:01,424
I am going to let all these
toxic little genies out of their bottles.

484
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,342
Do you understand me?

485
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,054
No, you're not gonna say a damn thing.

486
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,473
Do you know how I know?

487
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:13,394
Because as it turns out, I do have a tape
of you and Ponytail doing the nasty.

488
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,148
[Betty giggling]

489
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,946
And if you so much as utter
a single j'accuse,

490
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,198
I will release it, wide.

491
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,868
You think blackmail is gonna stop me?

492
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,789
Yes, because you're a hopeless romantic.

493
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,877
That tape might not hurt you, Jones.
But it will destroy Betty.

494
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,881
Something like that will haunt her
for the rest of her life.

495
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,383
So, what's it gonna be?

496
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,970
You wanna continue this sad attempt
at martyrdom,

497
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:52,517
or are you gonna protect the honor
of your precious girlfriend?

498
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,001
[Archie] Wait.

499
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,170
Something wrong, Arch?

500
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,344
I can't do it.

501
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,263
What the hell?

502
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,223
Vic, my grandpa started this company.

503
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,144
And my dad kept it going.
