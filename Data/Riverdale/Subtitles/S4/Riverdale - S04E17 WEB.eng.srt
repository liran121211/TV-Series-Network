-That wasn't an option, Ronnie.
-So, you do nothing instead?

337
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,567
This is my life, Archie. My father's life.

338
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,694

341
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,500
I came to surprise you with a study break.

342
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,504
-Tell me this is not what it looks like.
-It's not.

343
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,423
Oh, so you're not lying to me
about doing your homework

344
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,593

some new unsolvable mystery?

I'm doing both.

346
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:12,641
I went to the mat for you with Mr. Honey
and with all of your teachers.

347
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,685
-I didn't ask you to do that.
-I'm trying to make sure you graduate.

348
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:20,357
Jug, I'm trying to make sure
we stay together, that we have a future.

349
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,400
I'm sorry, in what future
are we not together?

350
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,778
I'm going to New Haven
in a few months, Jug.

351
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,988
That is happening.
Where are you going to be?

352
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,824
I thought I'd be your dorm-husband,

353
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,118
just eating pizza
while you studied criminal psych.

354
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,745
Yeah, well, I would rather that
than this dead-end Jughead.

355
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,039
Oh, the Jughead that was brained
with a rock?

356
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,376
I'm sorry I'm different now.

So, I'm afraid...

405
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:28,461
the most prudent action to take
at this moment is to...

cancel the variety show.

It was too short notice to get cupcakes

to come clean to me, but you did.

00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:26,337
Thanks to that, I got a doctor who said
it was lucky he saw Daddy when he did.

much worse than a fall.

all get to perform together, after all.

-Isn't that amazing?
-Yeah, that's awesome.
