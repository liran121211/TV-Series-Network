[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,720
You know what I think, Carrot Top?

3
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,514
I think you've got a hero complex.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:15,890
Who is Julian?

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,226
Julian was to be your triplet.

6
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:21,521
You had absorbed the third one.

7
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,649
The spirit of Julian
is haunting Thistlehouse?

8
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,818
[Cheryl] What other explanation
could there be?

9
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,822
[Hiram] Now that the trials are over,
it's time to let bygones be bygones.

10
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:33,491
Veronica, I have invited your father back.

11
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,868
I can't believe you.

12
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,161
We were done with him.

13
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,663
I want to ask you about Grandpa.
You know he was a writer?

14
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,749
My old man wasn't a writer.

15
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,209
He was a mean, mean drunk.

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,212
You two are trying to cover up something
about Mr. Chipping's suicide.

17
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,298
-Or was it a murder?
-You were there, Jones.

18
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,924
No one pushed him out that window.

19
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:50,842
What is this?

20
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,802
[Betty] Six hours of our house.

21
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,431
Why would somebody do that?
Film it and then leave the evidence.

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,312
[Jughead] <i>After a brief hiatus,</i>
<i>Riverdale's Watcher in the 'burbs</i>

23
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,023
<i>had released</i>
<i>his much-anticipated follow-up.</i>

24
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,735
<i>In the dead of night,</i>
<i>a second round of voyeuristic videotapes</i>

25
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,779
<i>had been left on doorsteps across town.</i>

26
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,533
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>VCRs were dusted off with dread.</i>

27
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,122
<i>And once again,</i>
<i>they played hours upon hours</i>

28
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,333
<i>of footage of the viewer's home.</i>

29
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,795
<i>Only this time,</i>
<i>the camera was much, much closer.</i>

30
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,506
<i>The implications were terrifying.</i>

31
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,675
<i>What was next for the Watcher,</i>
<i>breaking and entering?</i>

32
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,929
<i>And as if those deliveries</i>
<i>weren't unsettling enough,</i>

33
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,766
<i>colleges and universities had started</i>
<i>sending out their first wave of envelopes.</i>

34
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,060
<i>Some thin, some thick.</i>

35
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,437
<i>-All life-changing.</i>
-[girl] Crazy.

36
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:49,192
<i>Making it a particularly stressful time</i>
<i>for Riverdale High seniors.</i>

37
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,946
<i>Which is why Principal Honey asked</i>
<i>the school's guidance counselor,</i>

38
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,740
<i>Mrs. Burble,</i>
<i>to offer extended office hours.</i>

39
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,910
<i>So, whatever anxiety</i>

40
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,995
<i>they'd have</i>
<i>a licensed professional to go to</i>

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,581

42
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,670
<i>Something, it turned out,</i>
<i>many of us were long overdue for.</i>

43
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,756
Hey, Mom, I'm gonna make some High Point.
Do you want any?

44
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,680
What's wrong? Is everything okay?

45
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,933
You were so sweet
when you were little, Elizabeth.

46
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,311
So innocent. When did you become a liar?

47
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,480
What are you talking about?

48
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,235
"Dear Ms. Elizabeth Cooper,

49
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,321
after careful review
of your early-action application,

50
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,740
the Admissions Committee regrets
to inform you

51
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:42,495
that we are unable to offer you
a place at Yale University."

52
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:44,747
I didn't get in?

53
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,500
Wait, you opened my mail?

54
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,254
I thought to myself, "How could
my Betty get rejected from college?

55
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,716
What has her so unfocused
that it cost her her future?"

56
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,718
-So, I searched your bedroom.
-What?

57
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,054
Do you know what I found hidden
in the false bottom of your nightstand?

58
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,684
-Oh, my God, Mom.
-You should be studying.

59
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,812
You should be focused.
Instead, you are out of control.

60
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,939
Okay, that's it. This is the last straw.

61
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,942
We are not discussing this.
We're not discussing anything.

62
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,777
You and I are not on speaking terms.

63
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,656
You have been invading
my privacy for years, and it's over.

64
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,451
<i>[knock on door]</i>

65
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,870
Mrs. Burble, do you have a minute?

66
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,998
Mm! Yes. Ms. Cooper, come on in.

67
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:27,916
Please.

68
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,667
{\an8}Mmm. Skit-Skat?

69
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,753
{\an8}Oh. No, thanks.

70
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,548
I have-- I have a sweet tooth.

71
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,508
{\an8}So, how can I be of help?

72
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,596
Mom?

73
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,349
{\an8}Oh, we're in the middle of a session,
Mrs. Cooper.

74
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,308
It's Ms. Smith.

75
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,726
So, you're stalking me now, too?

76
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,604
Shocking as it may seem, Betty,
I didn't know that you would be here.

77
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,898
I came down to talk to Mrs. Burble myself.

78
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,567
{\an8}To see if she can give me
any insight on how to...

79
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,904
-talk to you.
-This. This is what's bothering me.

80
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,241
Her control complex,
her insane overreactions.

81
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,701
-This is my problem.
-No. What her problem is,

82
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,621
she's been rejected from college
because she's too busy having sex.

83
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,917
Is that what you associate with sexuality,
Ms. Smith? Shortcomings?

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,754
Excuse me, Ms. Burble, I must have missed
your doctorate on the wall

85
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,297
because I don't need a therapist.

86
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,425
Licensed psychologist, actually.

87
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,636
What Betty needs is an intervention

88
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,682
for this irresponsible disregard
for her future.

89
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,393
That's interesting,
I was gonna say that there were months,

90
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:32,814
or actually years' worth
of psychotic parenting to unpack.

91
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,691
Clearly, there are a lot of feelings here.

92
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:40,113
Betty, would it be okay with you
if your mother joined us?

93
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,532
Even if I said no, she would stay anyways.

94
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,328
Betty.

95
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,124
Do you hide things from your mother?

96
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,421
{\an8}Well, yeah, of course, everyone does.

97
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,338
{\an8}But--

98
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,966
{\an8}-I mean, I learned from the best.
-[scoffs]

99
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:04,262
-You feel she keeps secrets from you, too?
-Since literally the day l was born.

100
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,222
Only when it's in her best interest.

101
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,852
Oh! Oh, so you joining a cult,
that was in my best interest?

102
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:14,230
Not mentioning to me that you weren't
actually brainwashed the whole time.

103
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,276
You were just undercover with the FBI,
working with my long-lost half brother,

104
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,028
who I thought was dead.

105
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,279
That was in my best interest?

106
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,406
You're a child. I was protecting you.

107
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,284
Explain how giving away my college fund
to the Farm was part of that.

108
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,703
That was before,
when I was under the influence of Edgar.

109
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,539
How about when you didn't tell me
that I had the serial-killer genes.

110
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,876
Or when you had Polly committed
to the Sisters of Quiet Mercy

111
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,128
and didn't tell me where she was.

112
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:41,174
Or when you had me dragged off
to that evil nun hellhole.

113
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:45,053
Because she did, Mrs. Burble.
Where they force-fed me drugs.

114
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,179
But hey, but hey.

115
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,973
At least they were Fizzle Rocks
and not birth control.

116
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,892
-Context is important here.
-Because God forbid!

117
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,436
You ever realize that maybe
I started taking birth control

118
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,606
because I don't wanna have
a baby at 16 like you, or Polly?

119
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,608
I don't wanna be like the two of you,

120
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,612
pregnant and married to a murderer,
or a cult leader, or both?

121
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,031
I'd hoped I'd raised you
to be smarter than us.

122
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,241
And no offense, Mom, I am.

123
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,535
Being proactive is being smart.

124
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,456
You're acting so naive,
like you didn't think I was having sex?

125
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,041
Jughead and I sleep in the same bed.

126
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,959
[Alice] She's too young to have sex.

127
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:20,880
-She doesn't know what's good for her.
-You are so hypocritical.

128
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:26,135
I was fine taking care of myself
when you abandoned me for the Farm.

129
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,221
Yet you keep treating me like a child.

130
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,599
Oh, so that's a crime now,
a mother wanting to protect her child?

131
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,684
You've said that several times now.

132
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:38,147
"Betty's young. Betty's a child."
Why do you think that is?

133
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,315
She is.

134
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:44,028
[stammers] Look, it's fine for me.
I take her insults.

135
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,114
That's my cross to bear as a parent.

136
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,366
But the things that she's written
in her diaries...

137
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,867
You read her diaries?

138
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,579
Yes, because she has no boundaries,
no emotional respect, none.

139
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,914
How does that make you feel?

140
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,000
Like I'm filled with gunpowder

141
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,671
and I'm one "Elizabeth" away
from exploding.

142
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,756
You need to stop invading my privacy

143
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,718
and accept the fact
that I am becoming an adult.

144
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,556
You will always be my daughter, Elizabeth.

145
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:18,354
-And I am so, so worried about you.
-But not for the right reasons, Mom.

146
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,691
Forget about college, sex
and the serial-killer genes.

147
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,402
Think about everything
that you have done to me.

148
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,698
That is what I'm going to be unpacking
for the rest of my life.

149
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,661
So, you either...
start treating me like I'm an adult,

150
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,246
or I will not be in your life.

151
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:41,252
Ms. Smith, Betty's education,
her relationship, her behavior,

152
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,921
I think those things make you afraid.

153
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,632
Afraid that Betty is growing up.

154
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,969
That may even be why you gave away
her college money.

155
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,013
Because if you can control her,

156
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,225
you can hold on to her childhood
just a little bit longer.

157
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,060
Does that sound right?

158
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,146
It's just...

159
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,734
I've already lost two children.

160
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,363
First, Charles... then Polly.

161
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,823
And Betty...

162
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,244
Growing up, leaving for college.

163
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,497
Moving out, moving on.

164
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,044
-It just feels like I'm losing you, too.
-Mom, that's what happens.

165
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,464
Kids grow up and they leave.

166
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,885
I can't be your only hope.

167
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,222
But I love you.

168
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,767
I love you, too.
But that is not an apology.

169
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,898
That does not justify the horrible,
unhealthy things that you have done.

170
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,903
How you keep suffocating me, and why me?
Why are you doing this to me?

171
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,196
Because I love you.

172
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,073
But you love Polly, too.

173
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,576
She's in an asylum. She needs you.
She needs help.

174
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,205
-Why can't you go do this to her?
-Because I love you more.

175
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,165
I love you most.

176
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,180
{\an8}[door opens, then closes]

177
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,480
Newton's Laws of Motion.

178
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,857
{\an8}[echoing] Now, who can tell me...?

179
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,736
{\an8}[Kevin] Archie.

180
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,488
Archie.

181
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,490
{\an8}[louder] Archie.

182
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,538
{\an8}I'm so sorry, Dr. Phylum.

183
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,749
{\an8}Save it for Mrs. Burble.
I'm not interested in your explanations.

184
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,003
{\an8}I'm really sorry, Ms. Burble.
I've been having...

185
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,422
{\an8}trouble sleeping lately.

186
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,798
{\an8}Maybe it's like insomnia.

187
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,884
{\an8}No, it's okay, Archie.
I'm not here to reprimand you.

188
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,970
I just want to talk.

189
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,221
Oh, okay.

190
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,974
{\an8}-What about?
-Well, for starters, college.

191
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:04,061
{\an8}-You haven't applied to any.
-Yeah, I'm not really interested.

192
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,355
{\an8}I'm needed here in Riverdale.

193
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,065
To take over Andrews Construction?

194
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,859
{\an8}No, to clean up the town.

195
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,696
{\an8}Someone needs to step up,
like my dad would have.

196
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,992
{\an8}-He spent his whole life helping people.
-Can we talk about him for a second?

197
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,162
How are you managing?

198
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,581
{\an8}I try to carry on his legacy.

199
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,416
{\an8}You've already done so much good.

200
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,711
{\an8}You opened up a center for at-risk kids.

201
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,964
{\an8}-That's not enough.
-Why would you think that?

202
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,885
{\an8}Ever since I started trying to help,
things have gotten complicated.

203
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,389
{\an8}I've messed things up, and I have
to fix it, so no one else gets hurt.

204
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,599
{\an8}Hurt?

205
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,061
{\an8}Archie, I have to tell you...

206
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,815
{\an8}If you admit to a crime,
or tell me that you're putting yourself

207
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,069
{\an8}or anyone else in danger,
I am required to report it.

208
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,403
{\an8}-I'm fine.
-Are you?

209
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,532
{\an8}Because you've missed a lot football,
where you excelled.

210
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,828
{\an8}And those cuts and bruises on your hands
are not from sports.

211
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,416
{\an8}The truth is...

212
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,173
{\an8}-I go out at night.
-You mean cruising in Fox Forest?

213
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,425
{\an8}What? No. I don't mean that. [chuckles]

214
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,343
{\an8}I...

215
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,887
{\an8}I put on a mask...

216
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,808
{\an8}and I try to...

217
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,853
-help people.
-I'm not sure I follow.

218
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,313
I'm a big comic-book fan.

219
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,191
{\an8}Mr. Justice, the Comet, the Red Circle.

220
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,318
{\an8}I really identify with them, you know?

221
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,403
{\an8}Are you saying...

222
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,489
{\an8}that you're having fantasies...

223
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,575
{\an8}about acting like these comic book heroes?

224
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,660
Exactly.

225
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,829
{\an8}Like, there's this dealer, Dodger.

226
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:48,290
{\an8}He uses kids to do his dirty work. Kids.

227
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,168
{\an8}-And the police can't do anything.
-So, someone else has to stop him?

228
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,711
-Yes.
-To protect the community?

229
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,380
-Yes.
-A vigilante.

230
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,383
-No.
-Who protects the vigilante?

231
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,760
-Who cares?
-I don't read a lot of comics.

232
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,596
But doesn't the hero usually suffer
a great tragedy

233
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,182
and then create their persona out of rage?

234
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,976
-Is that right?
-Yeah, I guess so.

235
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,269
Doesn't that resonate with you?

236
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,481
Because everything that you've told me
feels like it could be fueled

237
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,358
by grief-induced anger--

238
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,694
Like I said, Ms. Burble,
I'm trying to help.

239
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,614
But to do it safely, we have
to acknowledge and work on the anger.

240
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,615
Why?

241
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,202
I know I'm angry, Ms. Burble.
I'm not an idiot.

242
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,955
Look at all the crappy things
that have happened to me.

243
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,039
To my friends.

244
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,749
To my dad.

245
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,710
They make me angry.

246
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,380
You... talking to me like I'm a moron.

247
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,757
-That makes me angry.
-Understandably.

248
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,842
And it hurts.

249
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,721
I hurt all the time.

250
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,600
And all I want to do
is make sure no one else does.

251
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,561
But I screwed it up.

252
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,937
[Archie sobs]

253
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:56,108
My mom almost got shot in a drive-by.

254
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,986
She was held at gunpoint on Thanksgiving.

255
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,614
How is a guy supposed to...

256
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,451
To clean up the town
and protect his loved ones

257
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,495
if he's putting them in the crosshairs?

258
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,832
So, what am I supposed to do?

259
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,461
Huh?

260
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,464
Theoretically?

261
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,473
The behavior you're discussing sounds
like an addiction.

262
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,641
No, it's not.

263
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,100
Isn't it?

264
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:34,396
You're aware of negative consequences,
but you're compelled anyway.

265
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,983
That's compulsive behavior.

266
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,903
Forget me going out at night.

267
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,949
Just running the center
has made me a target.

268
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,283
Yeah. But you keep at it.

269
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:51,080
It's the appropriate and smarter way
to channel your anger

270
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,581
and help those in need.

271
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,416
It feels like it's not enough.

272
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,502
Then why not enlist more volunteers?

273
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,591
Like me, or you can start an anonymous
tip line to give you farther reach

274
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,428
so those people who are scared
to talk to the police can report things.

275
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,390
I can't stress this enough, Archie.

276
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,684
Do not go out at night.

277
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:13,894
You could get hurt.

278
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,439
<i>Your loved ones could get hurt.</i>

279
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,860
-Mom, can we talk?
-Oh, boy. What's wrong?

280
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,991
I don't wanna give up on my work
at the community center.

281
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,577
Yeah, I know.
I've made my peace with that.

282
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,954
But I can't keep putting you in danger.

283
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,248
And Dodger and his family
are still out there.

284
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,792
And sooner or later,
they'll come after me, so...

285
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,254
I'm moving out.

286
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,215
-Archie, no.
-Mom, you don't have a choice.

287
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,217
I'm 18. I'm an adult.

288
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,013
I'm gonna move into the center,
just for a while,

289
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,849
until Sheriff Jones catches Dodger
and things cool off for a bit.

290
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,351
-Archie, you don't have to do that.
-Yes, I do.

291
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,978
Their war is with me, not with you.

292
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,983
It's okay. I'll be okay.

293
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,968
You have reached the Riverdale Hotline.

294
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,013
If you wish to report a problem
in your neighborhood, leave a message.

295
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,016
Anonymity is your choice.
We're here to help.

296
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:34,934
And remember...

297
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,894
you're not alone.

298
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,472
[bell ringing]

299
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,723
[speaking indistinctly]

300
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,435
[Doris on PA] <i>Cheryl Blossom,</i>
<i>please report to Principal Honey's office.</i>

301
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,938
And the War of the Red Roses rages on.

302
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,606
Good luck, babe.

303
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,027
So, wherefore are we rattling
sabers today, Principal Honey?

304
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,780
{\an8}Miss Blossom, do you know how many
absences you've had this semester?

305
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,115
Twenty-six.

306
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,243
Need I remind you and the sorry lot
of yams you call educators

307
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,746
that I have suffered
numerous family deaths.

308
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,375
My mother disappeared,
I am raising twin toddlers,

309
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,127
and I am the sole caregiver for my nana.

310
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,547
Yeah, well, it is for those reasons
that I have decided

311
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,299
to put a certified adult in charge
of the cheerleading squad.

312
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,384
Pause.

313
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,178
You're taking my Vixens away?

314
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,138
Mm.

315
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:55,723
I'll tell you what.

316
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,769
I will let Mrs. Burble interview you
and make a recommendation.

317
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,814
But if she deems you
psychologically unfit,

318
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:04,898
it's over.

319
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,906
{\an8}So, Cheryl...

320
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,409
Would you like a Three Buccaneers?

321
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,494
I don't eat nougat, I don't take bribes,

322
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,247
and I don't talk to trade school flunkies
about my feelings.

323
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,958
You know, Cheryl,
the only way you get what you want,

324
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,753
your Vixens back, is if you talk to me.

325
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,337
About you.

326
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,380
Okay, then.

327
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,300
I have a rapturous girlfriend,
total independence,

328
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,218
a 4.0, and amazing hair.

329
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,345
-Are we done?
-Not quite.

330
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,556
Did you receive a videotape?

331
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,934
-How'd it make you feel?
-[scoffs]

332
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,438
Please. I have felled multiple villains
with my bow over the years.

333
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:48,525
I'm not afraid of some sad AV pervert
with a camcorder older than your blazer.

334
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,194
Speaking of the last few years,

335
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:54,031
have you ever spoken to a professional
about everything you've been through?

336
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,201
Your mother's abuse,
your brother's murder,

337
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,911
your father's suicide,

338
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:04,083
{\an8}your time in conversion therapy,
and an organ harvesting cult.

339
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,836
-Your near-death experience in Sweet--
-That was an accident.

340
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,883
It'd be okay if you told me it wasn't.

341
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,554
Cheryl, you've endured
lifetimes of trauma.

342
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,809
I can't imagine going through
a single one, much less all.

343
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,311
And as a teenager? Unimaginable.

344
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,606
You are remarkably resilient.

345
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,566
It must be exhausting.

346
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,445
How have you been coping?

347
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,996
I talk to Jason.

348
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,917
I talk to my dead brother.
That's how I cope.

349
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,835
Like prayer.

350
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,712
That's a very healthy way
of dealing with grief.

351
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,630
No.

352
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,090
I...

353
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,300
go into the chapel...

354
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,970
in my house...

355
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,015
where my brother's body is...

356
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,268
and I talk to him.

357
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,940
And I think he answers me back.

358
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,404
I think...

359
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,614
maybe...

360
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,577
I've lost my mind
and I don't know when it happened.

361
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,454
Was it when J.J. died?

362
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,624
Was it when I fell through the ice?

363
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,377
Have I always been this way?

364
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,088
Fractured.

365
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,135
In the tomb,
when you're speaking with Jason,

366
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,303
how far away are you?

367
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,305
I usually sit across the room.

368
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,140
What does it matter?

369
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,602
What's the difference between that
and people visiting a gravesite

370
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,103
to talk to their loved ones?

371
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,190
Or people who have urns on their mantel?

372
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,858
That ash...

373
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,903
those rotting bodies...

374
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,197
they don't talk back.

375
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,948
I'm not sure Jason does either.

376
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,783
I think you want him to.

377
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,328
But you're not crazy, Cheryl.

378
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,663
You miss your brother.

379
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,960
But missing Jason doesn't explain
the other goings-on

380
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,004
in the phantasmagoria
that is Thistlehouse.

381
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,923
What's happening in this Thistlehouse?

382
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,383
I am being haunted by a ghost.

383
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,927
Ghosts don't exist.

384
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,512
Your life may be defined by gothic tropes,

385
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,015
but you're being haunted by grief,

386
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,644
by guilt over your family's misfortune,
your brother's death.

387
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,812
Brothers. Plural.

388
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,941
I'm confused.
Is this a metaphorical brother?

389
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,275
No, you mallard.

390
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,611
I had a triplet, Julian,

391
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,322
whom I absorbed in the womb
and has resurfaced as a doll

392
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,241
that's moving around my house,
causing mischief.

393
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,702
I've thrown him away, buried him,
encircled him in salt,

394
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,579
and he keeps coming back.

395
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,791
Because he's angry. He's vengeful.

396
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,209
Julian's driving you insane?

397
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,877
Of course. He's a Blossom!

398
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,216
So...

399
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,138
do you still maintain
that I'm not mad as a hatter,

400
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:09,476
even though I'm talking to taxidermy
and being tormented by a devil doll?

401
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,687
I don't think
you're being haunted, Cheryl.

402
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,273
And I don't think you've lost your mind.

403
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:19,236
Then what's... wrong with me? [sobbing]

404
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,699
I think someone is trying
to make you think

405
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,409
that you've lost your mind.

406
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,412
-I think you're being gaslit.
-Like...

407
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,664
Ingrid Bergman?

408
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,707
In fact, yes.

409
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,334
What sounds most logical to you?

410
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,964
That the evil spirit of an absorbed fetus
is inhabiting an anthropomorphic doll?

411
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:45,887
Or that a human being is moving that doll
around your house when you're not there?

412
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,556
But Julian...

413
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,642
We can find out the truth
about Julian's existence

414
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,810
with a swab of your saliva.

415
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,521
You can't have any of my bodily fluids,
you succubus.

416
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,732
It's for a chimerism lab.

417
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:01,403
A test that shows whether a person
absorbed a fetus in the womb

418
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:06,867
by analyzing if they have
one set of DNA or two.

419
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,870
If I were to guess,
you aren't going to test positive.

420
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,041
You mean to tell me
this test has existed this whole time?

421
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,502
Mm-hm. I'm going to give you the number
of a doctor I know...

422
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,005
who can perform the test.

423
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,257
I'll give her a heads-up
that she might be expecting you.

424
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,842
So...

425
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,511
what about my precious Vixens?

426
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,597
Can I keep them?

427
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,850
As a counselor,
I think you've done A-plus work.

428
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,061
As an administrator,

429
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,896
Cheryl, I'm sorry.

430
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,901
I'm going to recommend to Principal Honey
that he bring in a coach.

431
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,237
To supervise the Vixens,

432
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:48,241
while you focus on you...
for a little while.

433
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,336
[indistinct chatter]

434
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,797
[softly] Shh. There she is.

435
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,223
[muffled scream]

436
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,398
[sobbing]

437
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,993
[Hiram] <i>Mija? </i>Can you come here a minute?

438
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,878
What do you want, Daddy?

439
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,673
To tell me about
another secret love child?

440
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,800
No. I need your keen eye.

441
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,593
-Is it centered?
-Mm-hm.

442
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,847
<i>Maravillosa,</i> don't you think?

443
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,518
The first bottle of Lodge Rum
I ever produced.

444
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,687
And second to you

445
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,565
and my diploma from Harvard University,

446
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,108
my proudest achievement.

447
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,401
I'm late for school.

448
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,863
Oh, speaking of Cambridge,
didn't you apply to Harvard early action?

449
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,781
I should be hearing anon.

450
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,034
Now if you'll excuse me,
microeconomics waits for no woman.

451
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,791
[Kevin] <i>Game theory is all about strategy.</i>

452
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,170
And yeah, it's big in econ,
but it's also been applied to war.

453
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,546
[cell phone buzzing]

454
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,175
Oh, my God, sorry, I have to take this.

455
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,471
Good afternoon, Dean Kingsley.

456
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,682
To what do I owe the pleasure?

457
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,101
[Kingsley] <i>Miss Luna,</i>
<i>I know it's unorthodox,</i>

458
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,605
<i>but as Dean of Admissions,</i>
<i>I wanted to give you a personal heads-up.</i>

459
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:46,526
<i>Congratulations on your acceptance</i>
<i>to Harvard's class of 2024.</i>

460
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,873
Thank you so much, Dean Kingsley.
August can't come soon enough.

461
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,959
<i>Indeed. Now, will you give my regards</i>
<i>to your father?</i>

462
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,670
<i>And, please, thank him</i>
<i>for the rum he sent. </i>Veritas.

463
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,840
Son of a--

464
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:09,925
{\an8}[Burble] Butter Flinger?

465
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,304
I think I know why you're here.

466
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,599
{\an8}Are there any updates I need
to make to your file?

467
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,352
{\an8}Regarding, say... Harvard?

468
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,479
Oh.

469
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,898
Uh, yes, actually, I got in.

470
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,316
Congratulations, Veronica.

471
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,693
If I'm not mistaken,
that was your dream school.

472
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,778
It was.

473
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,405
Now it's my nightmare.

474
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,407
Aren't you proud
of this milestone achievement?

475
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,243
No, I didn't "achieve" Harvard.

476
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,912
Once again,
my father meddled in my affairs,

477
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,624
and apparently, bought my way
into their ivy-covered walls with rum,

478
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,751
threats, money, charm, who knows?

479
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,836
It's humiliating and infuriating.

480
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,047
Because he didn't think you can do it
on your own?

481
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:49,965
No.

482
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,134
Because now I'll never know
if I could do it on my own.

483
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,429
Is it possible he was actually trying
to just help?

484
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,015
My father has a bank vault for a heart.

485
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,435
He did this to prove he can
and always will control me.

486
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,481
And do you feel this control is him
punishing you for something?

487
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,734
Was King Lear's ego gossamer thin? Yes.

488
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,779
This is what he does,
he fake-sold me two businesses,

489
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:16,658
and then conned me into running them--
Successfully, might I add.

490
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,451
--then charged me protection.

491
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:22,455
He lured my boyfriend into crime,
then tried to kill him in front of a crowd

492
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,124
at an illegal boxing match.

493
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,625
He had my mother arrested.

494
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:26,960
And the pièce de résistance?

495
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,962
He brought his secret,
illegitimate daughter

496
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,755
back to Riverdale
to try and make me jealous.

497
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,841
Well, blow, winds, and crack your cheeks

498
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,011
because Veronica Luna is
no one's Cordelia.

499
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,765
Are you jealous of your sister?

500
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,267
Absolutely not.

501
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,686
She can have him. They deserve each other.

502
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,521
Yet I'm sensing animosity.

503
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,480
Sensing?

504
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,483
I despise that man.
I want nothing to do with him.

505
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,068
But you willingly live at home?

506
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,239
-Well, yes, but--
-You obediently come when he calls you.

507
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,575
Veronica, I don't think this is hate.

508
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,909
It's obsession.

509
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,121
You and your father are obsessed
with each other.

510
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,332
You're diagnosing me with daddy issues?

511
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,334
How very Intro to Psych.

512
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,501
I'm saying,

513
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:14,799
your connection goes far beyond that
of a typical father-daughter.

514
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,594
It's primal, cosmic.

515
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,638
He sees you as an extension of himself,

516
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,641
which is why he'll never fully let you go.

517
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,937
And you see him as your ideal future self.

518
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,357
No, that's baseless.

519
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,734
I have no desire to become my father.

520
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,987
You're a straight-A student.
You run two flourishing businesses.

521
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,156
You just got admitted into Harvard.

522
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,116
I mean, maybe that's your base resentment.

523
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,702
He is an abjectly bad person.

524
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,496
I have zero respect for him.

525
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,082
And yet he has instilled in you a drive

526
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,043
that is perhaps the reason
why you are so successful.

527
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,170
He's taken more than he's ever given.

528
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,047
My old friend Dr. Freud

529
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,761
has two diagnoses that seem pertinent
to your situation.

530
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,763
The Oedipus and Electra complexes.

531
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,599
I've always seen the drama in my life
as Shakespearean,

532
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:09,270
not the stuff of Greek tragedy,
but, please, enlighten me.

533
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:13,900
You're locked in a constant battle
for identity with your father.

534
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:19,989
You're driven by compulsive forces
like love, sexuality, obsession.

535
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,325
I'm not stabbing my eyes out for any man.

536
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,912
Acknowledging that the tether exists is
the first step towards breaking it.

537
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:30,750
Electra murdered Agamemnon.
What are you saying, Mrs. Burble?

538
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:34,754
Obviously, I'm not suggesting murder.
But rather to cut ties with him.

539
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,172
For good.

540
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,384
He's trolling you. So, why not ghost him?

541
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:45,014
No offense, Mrs. Burble,
but your "teen speak" could use an update.

542
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,518
As could your advice.
I've tried that repeatedly.

543
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,479
Well, it only works if you actually want
to walk away.

544
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,523
Do you?

545
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:56,776
Yes.

546
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,905
Well, obviously, I think
you should say yes to Harvard.

547
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,451
But moving forward,
I recommend that no matter what,

548
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,662
you do not engage
with your father on his terms.

549
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,582
You may be his hubris,
but he can't be yours.

550
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,375
Or else he will be your downfall.

551
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,796
I really, really want to go to Harvard.

552
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,052
You're locked in a dance of death
with your father, Veronica.

553
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,140
So, my last question is this:

554
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,309
Who's leading?

555
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,187
Him or you?

556
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,155
[Dupont] You're late.

557
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,700
Apparently I'm not the only one.
Don't we have seminar today?

558
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,119
I dismissed the others
to continue writing.

559
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,455
You haven't even started.

560
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,416
Yeah, I know I'm supposed
to turn in pages this week.

561
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,002
You were offered
an opportunity here, Mr. Jones.

562
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,879
Frankly, you have squandered it.

563
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,673
I've been told you haven't even applied
to any colleges yet.

564
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,802
Okay, I'm sorry. My plate's been stacked.

565
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,095
I can still apply for regular admission.

566
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,849
And I can't imagine any teachers here
writing a letter of recommendation

567
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,476
for such an apathetic student.

568
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:16,189
You might want to beg the indulgences
of your teachers at your public alma mater

569
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,691
vis-a-vis your future matriculations.

570
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,784
{\an8}How long does it usually take
to get a transcript?

571
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:32,622
{\an8}Well, I'm sure Ms. Bell is going
as fast as she can.

572
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,041
But while we wait,
why don't we just have a little chat?

573
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:39,838
Uh, no. I have a hard Holden Caulfield
stance on phony small talk. Thanks.

574
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,424
Do you often use fictional references
to make sense of your situation?

575
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:44,884
Yes. Yes, I do.

576
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,762
I heard about your teacher, Mr. Chipping.

577
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,850
Public suicide, that's, uh, tragic.

578
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,186
He didn't kill himself, he was murdered.
By suicide, I guess.

579
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,106
-Who knows what they're capable of?
-Who?

580
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,192
Uh, DuPont and the students,
they convinced him to jump.

581
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,528
Because I'm on the cusp
of bringing down their empire.

582
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,446
-Which empire?
-Baxter Brothers.

583
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,575
My grandfather created them.

584
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,743
As in inspired the characters?

585
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,829
No. As in he wrote the first book.

586
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,874
And then DuPont stole the franchise
out from under him.

587
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:19,460
Now, he's got us competing to ghostwrite
the next one, but what's the point?

588
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,212
It's rigged. He's a thief.

589
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,339
He has a grudge against anyone
with the name Forsythe.

590
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,425
Starting with my grandfather, the first.

591
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:30,179
Or you have a persecution complex.

592
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,349
Are you paranoid? Chasing windmills?

593
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:38,563
So, you have a reasonable excuse
to neglect your real work, writing?

594
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,942
Is that your advice after everything
I said? "Just do your homework, kid."

595
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,987
Well, I'm wondering if the real reason
why you're so focused

596
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,948
on proving that the Baxter Brothers
belongs to your family

597
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,408
is because you're afraid.

598
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,952
Are you insecure about your own talent
as a writer?

599
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,454
I won't be psychoanalyzed by someone

600
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,539
who doesn't know
the phrase "tilting at windmills."

601
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,207
It's about recognition.

602
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,878
It's about not letting some ascot steal
my family's achievements.

603
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,713
My grandfather could have been
Gatsby rich.

604
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:04,923
You know what he was instead?

605
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,301
He was a mean drunk
who beat my father in a trailer.

606
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,094
But from what you're describing,

607
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:14,349
this investigation is trying to get
those very things you claim to hate.

608
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,185
An inheritance, status, prestige.

609
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,855
-I'm not trying to be like them.
-No, clearly.

610
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,065
Better not to try at all.

611
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:25,109
Fulfill their expectation
that you're a bum,

612
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,030
then claim that they didn't give you
a chance. That is the easy path.

613
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:33,242
Now, your father, on the other hand,
he took the harder one.

614
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,829
Good. The "Designated Dad" part
of this lecture.

615
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:41,834
He's a sheriff now. Came from
a poor household with an abusive father

616
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,254
and did the work to transform himself.

617
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,674
And sacrificed so you could succeed.

618
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,427
I bet he was very supportive
of you going to Stonewall Prep.

619
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,430
He practically dragged me there.

620
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:57,183
And you repay him by going
on this quest to prove

621
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,853
that the man that caused him immeasurable
pain is some kind of wronged hero.

622
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,356
How do you think that makes him feel?

623
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,611
Maybe instead of lionizing
your grandfather...

624
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,701
you should try seeing him
through your father's eyes.

625
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,166
I won't think you're less smart
if you admit that I'm right.

626
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,712
You're right.

627
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,465
My poor dad.

628
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,432
I'm so selfish.

629
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:41,394
No. You're just a high school senior
from Riverdale.

630
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,105
You're busy.

631
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,318
Maybe I should, uh...

632
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,283
put down the conspiracy theories
and just do my homework.

633
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,705
-You're underpaid, aren't you?
-And overqualified.

634
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:05,043
Which means I don't expect anyone
to change habits overnight.

635
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:09,422
If you're going to see this mystery
of the Baxter Brothers authorship through,

636
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,426
don't fall back on conjecture
or righteous anger.

637
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,720

639
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,686

about those transcripts, huh?

Oh, what's all this?

I love you and I appreciate everything
that you've done for me. I--

Mrs. B enlightened me to the realization

673
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,781
that most likely someone is trying
to drive me mad.

674
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,867
But once I find out
who this depraved monster is,

675
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,161
I will unleash a wrath
upon them so wicked,

676
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,956
they will wish they had been consumed
in their mother's womb.

677
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:13,791
[Hiram] Veronica!

678
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,754
What's the matter, Daddy?

679
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,632
Why did I get a call
from Dean Kingsley informing me

680
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,093
that you turned down
your acceptance to Harvard?

681
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,763
-Please tell me he's sorely mistaken.
-There's been no mistake.

682
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,390
I won't be a Crimson come fall.

683
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,226
Besides, I look better
in Yale blue anyway.

684
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,352
[groans]

685
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:34,770
Are you insane?

686
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:39,233
No one rejects Harvard. It was your dream.

687
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,154
One of my dreams, yes.
But then you ruined it for me.

688
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,656
Walking through those ivory towers,

689
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,076
I'd be letting you dictate
the rest of my life.

690
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,163
I'd graduate, get my MBA from Oxford,

691
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,333
run a Fortune 500,
make the cover of <i>Fives,</i> obviously.

692
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,003
The next 20 years would be
mapped out by you.

693
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,673
I'm finished living
your version of my life.

694
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:07,678
You don't get to own my future,
so consider the ties that bind cut.

695
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,389
Really?

696
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,142
And what do you think you'll do now, <i>mija?</i>

697
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,227
Walk away from me? [scoffs]

698
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,438
You've never been able to do that.

699
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:24,403
You're right. It would appear we're locked
in a twisted Greek tragedy.

700
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:28,657
But my guidance counselor told me
that there is one way to end this.

701
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,578
I have to kill you.

702
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,375
Don't worry, I wouldn't stoop
to your level to murder. No.

703
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,837
I'm going to kill you on the battlefield
you cherish above all others.

704
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,547
Business.

705
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,510
I'm going to take you on head-to-head
and destroy you.

706
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,846
Just like Oedipus and Electra did
to their daddies.

707
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,931
And when I'm done,

708
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:56,977
I will bury your battered
and beaten carcass, and be free of you.

709
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,230
Once and for all.

710
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,029
This bottle I cracked open?

711
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,616
It's a lot better than the swill
you've been making recently, Daddy.

712
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:15,454
But my rum will be far superior.

713
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,647
These are really great, Jug.

714
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,608
You really captured the essence
of the Baxter Brothers,

715
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,110
but you made it your own.

716
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,320
I caught up
on all my college applications.

717
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,864
I wanna show you something.

718
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:55,619
This is an article I found from 2002.

719
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,874
[Betty] "Novelist Theodore Weisel drowns
in yachting accident."

720
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,250
Why does he sound familiar?

721
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,003
He was in the Quill and Skull
literary society with my grandfather.

722
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,754
I tracked down all the original members.

723
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,508
They could tell you something about what
your granddad and DuPont were like then.

724
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:13,095
But guess what? Theodore was not
the only one who suffers an accident.

725
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,432
This one is from 1978.

726
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,058
Drove off a bridge.

727
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,353
This one's from 1994. Mechanical failure.

728
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,148
In fact, DuPont and my MIA grandfather

729
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,192
are the only ones in the society
who are not dead.

730
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,778
Which begs the question, are these
all horrible, suspicious accidents?

731
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,030
Or murders?

732
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,534
Jug, if you're right,
you need to transfer.

733
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,452
I can't.

734
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,205
-We're so close to this. I can feel it.
-Yeah.

735
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,207
<i>That's what I'm afraid of.</i>

736
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,631
Are you sure these are
the three suspects you saw that night?

737
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,591
It's definitely them.

738
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,427
Those are the kids we saw kill Jughead.
