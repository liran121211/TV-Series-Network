the spirit of Julian

These kids, they're good kids, Reg.

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,062
We're thinking the Bulldogs
could be Big Brothers to them.

7
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,064
Did you happen to know my grandfather?

8
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,859
{\an8}[DuPont] Your grandfather was
an excellent writer.

9
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,695
[Betty] We don't actually know anything
about Charles.

10
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,115
I'm interested in,
is he a serial killer or not?

11
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,786
-You see, our father needed help.
-Our father?

-Hey.

00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:35,989
Are you okay?

47
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,408
Yeah, I just can't write.

48
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,787
Mr. Chipping gave the class this
assignment where we're supposed to write

49
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:47,208
our own version of a Baxter Brothers
novel, which should be a dream come true.

50
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,627
But for the first time in my life,
I'm having writer's block.

51
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,840
-Why?
-My advice? Just take a break.

52
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,551
Okay? Take a walk. Look at some art.

00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,261
Kiss your girlfriend.

54
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,097
I keep thinking I should break
the Baxter Brothers novels down,

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,225
-like scientifically or something.
-That could work.

56
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,393
But you could also...

57
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,854
kiss your girlfriend.

58
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,398
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,112
[voices speaking indistinctly]

60

What are you all doing here?

61
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,334
Julian needs a body, Cheryl,

62
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,669
so we're giving him yours.

63
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,296

64
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,380
[gasps]

65
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,488
What?

66
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,201
Andrews, you asked us to be Big Brothers,

67
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:08,164
-not soldiers in a turf war. Who did this?
-I got a pretty good idea.

68
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,212
It was definitely Dodger.
He's been coming after us for weeks.

69
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,216
We've been chipping away at his gang,
there's more kids getting off the streets.

70
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,928
But there's only so much we can do
until Dodger himself is behind bars.

71
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,806
I can add Sketch Alley
to the nightly patrol, Red.

72
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,351
That's great, but go after Dodger.
He works out of the Wipeout Arcade.

73
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,981
Based on the last few days
of following Charles,

74
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,234
this is what I've logged:
7 a.m., he leaves the Five Seasons,

75
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,736
where he has a suite,
and goes to the FBI field office.

76
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,823
He has all of his meals at Pop's
or our house.

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,200
And then rounding out his daily routine,

78
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,619
he goes to the Casa Grande Gym
for a 90-minute workout,

79
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,455
including weekends, and then he goes
back to the Five Seasons.

80
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,876
Well, I'm no expert, Betty, but...

81
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,005
it doesn't sound
like Charles is a serial killer.

82
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,801
It kind of just sounds like he's a...
A lonely gay guy.

83
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,429
Well, maybe he's both.

84
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:08,808
Oh, my God.

85
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,854
Of course.

86
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:20,403
Now that the trials are over, I think
it's time to let bygones be bygones.

87
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,197
[speaking in Spanish]

88
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,076
I want us to move forward.
No more secrets, no more lies.

89
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,412
Speaking of secrets and lies,

90
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,290
how many more secret children
should we be expecting?

91
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,834
Hermosa is your one and only half-sibling.

92
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,794
I swear.

93
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,630
If we did decide
to move forward together...

94
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,800
what exactly would that look like?

95
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,636
Well, now that the prison
is bringing in a good income,

96
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,097
I'd like to return to my true passion.

97
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,223
Extortion?

98
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,018
-Murder?
-Rum.

99
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,521
<i>Papi's</i> passion is rum.

100
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,191
Rum has been in our family
for generations.

101
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,027
And Hermosa, who runs our clubs in Miami,

102
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,323
will be staying here in Riverdale
to establish a rum outpost here.

103
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,201
I also thought she could help out
at the speakeasy.

104
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,453
No.

105
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,747
I don't need any more help
at La Bonne Nuit.

106
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,000
With the exception of my newest hostess.

107
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,380
And, seeing as how this is our house,

108
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,467
you two can show yourselves out.

109
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,349
You sure it's safe out here at night?

110
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,267
I'll be all right, Mr. Jones.

111
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,353
What's up?

112
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,439
Well, off your intel and probable cause,

113
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,982
we raided the Wipeout Arcade,

114
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,027
turned over every pinball
and Pac-Man machine in it.

115
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,321
Found plenty of contraband, but...

116
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,575
none on Dodger. He was clean.

117
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,245
And let me guess,
you found it on a bunch of kids?

118
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,248
That scumbag is using them, Mr. Jones.

119
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,876
Even so, I can't arrest Dodger
unless I find evidence on him.

120
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,086
You're not going to,

121
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,421
not as long as he has
these kids working for him.

122
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,190
[Jughead] <i>I think there's</i>
<i>a real-life mystery in these books.</i>

123
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,735
I've gone and reread the entire series,
and I noticed something strange.

124
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,322
While there is a house voice
and an overall tone, sure,

125
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,450
you can tell
when a new ghostwriter takes over.

126
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,661
Well, yeah, a writer can't completely
suppress their own style.

127
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,873
Exactly. The verbiage, the phrasing.
They're like literary fingerprints.

128
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,167
And when I went back to read
the first book,

129
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,086
its fingerprint is unlike
any of the rest of them.

130
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,255
It's raw. It's real.

131
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:48,050
The characters have tension. There's
political commentary woven throughout.

132
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,511
They mention the war,
the boys have summer jobs.

133
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,305
None of the rest of them
are this grounded.

134
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,848
Meaning?

135
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,309
Allegedly, Mr. DuPont wrote
the first five books

136
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,810
before passing the series off.

137
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,731
But after my analysis, the stylistic
differences from Book 1 to Book 2

138
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,191
are too distinct to ignore.

139
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:07,153
There's no way that whoever wrote
the first novel wrote the following.

140
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,198
-There's just no way.
-Okay. Well, who wrote it, then?

141
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,076
This is gonna sound crazy, okay?

142
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,079
What if it was my grandfather?

143
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:23,419
Jug, your conspiracy theories
are usually spot-on, but this one...

144
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,964
feels like a real stretch.

145
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:27,882
I know.

146
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,928
This is the one missing puzzle piece
I have on my grandfather.

147
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,971
Think about it, Betty.

148
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:38,267
He sent me a first edition,
first Baxter Brothers book.

149
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,311
And if that's not coincidental enough,

150
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,438
he wrote inside:

151
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,442
"Never let them take anything from you."

152
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,571
Does that not imply
that something was stolen from him?

153
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,573
Implies, yes. Proves...

154
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,035
no. You need proof, Jug.

155
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,579
Yeah, you're right.

156
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,499
I'll get proof.
I know I'm on to something.

157
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,500
I know it.

158
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,506
Meanwhile, how's the mystery
of our suspicious brother going?

159
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,050
I'm following a hunch, too.

162
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,189
Hello, Chic.

163
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,198
{\an8}I wanna know about Charles,

164
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,867
{\an8}that story you told us about him.

165
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,079
{\an8}Is it true that you lived together
at the Last Resort Youth Hostel?

166
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,914
Yes, it is.

167
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,500
{\an8}When I went there,

168
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,337
{\an8}a neighbor told me about
seeing bloody sheets in the dumpster

169
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,591
{\an8}and Charles mysteriously vanishing.
Does any of that ring a bell?

170
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,052
{\an8}Charles, your brother, and I,
we were together.

171
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,181
One time,
we brought a friend home with us.

172
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,727
{\an8}We were doing jingle-jangle,
a little too much...

173
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,023
{\an8}and things got out of control.
Charles snapped.

174
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,651
{\an8}It was like some darkness took over.

175
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,489
{\an8}He grabbed a pair of scissors
and he stabbed the guy to death.

176
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,243
{\an8}How do I know
that you're telling the truth?

177
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,996
{\an8}Why would I lie at this point, Betty?

178
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,833
What does Charles say happened?

179
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,013
{\an8}Babe, what gives?
I thought you were going to school today.

180
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,935
{\an8}I was, for realsies, but...

181
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,564
{\an8}I can't leave Nana and the twins here
alone with...

182
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,733
you-know-who.

183
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,444
{\an8}Cheryl, this has to end.

184
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,655
You've missed way too much school.

185
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,368
{\an8}Okay, so get up,
or I'm gonna drag you there myself.

186
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,911
Okay, Tee-Tee.

187
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,832
{\an8}But there's one thing we need to do first.

188
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:15,174
{\an8}[Cheryl] Fact:
Evil spirits can't cross a circle of salt.

189
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,135
It's a barrier against all forms
of malevolence.

190
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,012
{\an8}Okay.

191
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,557
{\an8}All done. I'll get dressed and off we go.

192
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,607
{\an8}Wait. You went and saw Chic about me?

193
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,860
{\an8}Why not just ask me
if you're so damn curious?

194
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,488
{\an8}Because I don't trust you, all right?

195
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,449
{\an8}All I know is you're predisposed
to being a serial killer,

196
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,118
{\an8}and I've been burned before.

197
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,371
{\an8}-What did he even say to you?
-Oh, he spun quite the yarn.

198
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,332
{\an8}About how you stabbed a man
with a pair of scissors

199
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,918
{\an8}-when you were high on jingle-jangle.
-Oh.

200
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,088
{\an8}Now, I take everything Chic says
with a grain of salt...

201
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,175
{\an8}but do you have a polygraph machine
we can use here?

202
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,554
{\an8}Yes. Why?

203
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,307
{\an8}[Archie] Toby, Eddie,

204
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,144
{\an8}tell me.
Why do you keep running with Dodger?

205
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,396
Well, he pays us.

206
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,149
{\an8}Yeah, in Wipeout coinage.

207
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,360
-You're giving your money back to him?
-Plus, we get all the free pizza we want.

208
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,780
{\an8}You guys realize
you're risking everything,

209
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,451
your entire future, your lives,
for pizza and arcade games?

210
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,331
{\an8}[Archie] You guys don't have
any spare arcade games lying around?

211
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,333
What's this now, Archiekins?

212
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,670
{\an8}I'm trying to get these kids away
from Dodger's arcade.

213
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,006
{\an8}Step one: Give them another option.

214
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,468
{\an8}What you're doing at the El Royale
is so inspiring, Archie,

215
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,219
but not enough people know about it.

216
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,472
Well, I can write about the center
in <i>The Blue and Gold.</i>

217
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,601
{\an8}And I'll ask my vendors to see if they
can help rustle up some arcade games.

218
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:53,063
{\an8}[Doris] <i>Will Cheryl Blossom please report</i>
<i>to the principal's office?</i>

219
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,566
<i>Cheryl Blossom to the principal's office.</i>

220
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,321
Why for was I summoned, Miss Bell?

221
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,741
Cheryl, there's been an accident
at Thistlehouse.

222
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,785
One of the twins, Dagwood,

223
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,038
swallowed a ping-pong ball

224
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,706
-and started to choke.
-What?

225
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,500
He was taken to the hospital,

226
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:16,253
where Dr. Saperstein performed
a tracheotomy.

227
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,882
-On Dagwood?
-Oh, he's doing very well, I'm told.

228
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:24,720
Your grandmother's at the hospital
with Juniper, waiting for you.

229
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,849
I'll get to the hospital posthaste, but
I need to take care of one thing first.

230
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,393
[Veronica] <i>In the words</i>
<i>of Dame Julie Andrews:</i>

231
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,812
"Let's start at the very beginning." So...

232
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,566
hostess details to track:
who's coming, where to seat them.

233
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,194
-Ms. Danvers near Bob Potter, always.
-Mm-hm.

234
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,697
Where not to seat them.
Booth 11 is the worst.

235
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,367
-Enemies only.
-Okay, hold on, I'm gonna need a pen.

236
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,245
Mom, don't worry.

237
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,830
I will be right behind the bar
if you need me.

238
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,630
Damn you, demon doll!

239
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,264
Of course you'd be here.

240
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,808
How dare you go after Dagwood
to get to me.

241
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,354
[door opens, then footsteps]

242
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,147
Don't move, either of you.

243
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,737
-Aunt Cricket? Uncle Bedford?
-Cheryl.

244
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,532
We let ourselves in.
Hope that's all right.

245
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,120
[oldies music playing over speakers]

246
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:32,997
Veronica.

247
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,498
Ronnie.

248
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,042
Oh, God.

249
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,545
Daddy.

250
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,630
Hermosa.

251
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,633
You're not on the reservation list.

252
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,846
Well, I couldn't miss your mother's
reentry into the workforce, could I?

253
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,557
At the clubs I run in Miami,

254
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,518
I always keep a table reserved
for special guests.

255
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,189
Same. Mark them down for Booth 11.

256
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,364
Shall we begin?

257
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,874
You claimed you and Chic met
on the streets.

258
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,043
True or false?

259
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,588
True. When we were both at our lowest.

260
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,260
Yes or no, someone was murdered
in the room you shared at the hostel.

261
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,557
Yes. I came home
from the grocery store one day

262
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,225
and found a dead man in our bed...

263
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,729
Chic covered in his blood.

264
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,814
Some trick that he had brought home.

265
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,318
My instincts took over.

266
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,363
I dissolved the body with lye
in the bathroom tub,

267
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,659
threw out the sheets,
scrubbed the room clean with bleach.

268
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,619
Chic watched.

269
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,871
That was the end of us.

270
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,666
I left him,

271
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,334
started over.

272
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,504
[Betty] Next question:

273
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,465
Are you hiding anything from us?

274
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,727
Tell me what, Charles.

275
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,399
I'm a recovering addict.

276
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,319
I attend weekly
Narcotics Anonymous meetings.

277
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,866
Here in Riverdale, they're held at my gym.

278
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,538
-Charles, I--
-That's my big secret, Betty.

279
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,543
Hope you're satisfied.

280
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,475
Mr. Lodge.

281
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,437
What the hell are you doing here?

282
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,488
I came because I never had
the chance to, uh...

283
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,619
tell you that I'm sorry
for your loss, Archie.

284
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,538
Your father was a good man

285
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,124
and he'd be proud of you.

286
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,127
Thank you, sir.

287
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,757
And in his honor,

288
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,676
I'd like to make a charitable donation.

289
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,513
I hear this place could use the help.

290
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,808
Oh, no, no, we're all good here. Thanks.

291
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,061
It's a blank check, Archie.

292
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,564
All your problems, your money woes,
they go away.

293
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,567
Nothing's that simple with you.

294
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,987
Like I said, we're all good. Thanks.

295
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:03,373
Oh, Tee-Tee, I had
the most horrible phantasmagoria.

296
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,503
Dagwood swallowed a ping-pong ball,

297
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,255
and my accursed family came
to Thistlehouse.

298
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,758
Oh, good. She's up.

299
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,261
Cheryl, dear,
we'd love to see you downstairs.

300
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,180
Once you've collected yourself.

301
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,434
My Toni tells me you're here to discuss
our maple syrup business?

302
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,020
Yes. We want to sell it.

303
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,772
The rest of the family is in agreement.

304
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,899
But with your father dead
and Penelope in the wind,

305
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,945
we need your participation
and signature to move forward.

306
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,156
And why, pray tell,
do you vipers wanna sell

307
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,117
what's left of our family's legacy?

308
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,536
The business hasn't been profitable
in years.

309
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,912
It's bleeding us dry.

310
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,834
Babe, it's up to you.

311
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,753
But this house has caused you
nothing but pain.

312
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,259
Hey, if you sold it, we can start
somewhere new, somewhere fresh.

313
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,473
Your proposal makes a modicum of sense.

314
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,436
-I'll consider it.
-That's wonderful news.

315
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,439
Now, would you mind
if we went down to the chapel

316
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,609
to light a votive candle of thanksgiving
to celebrate?

317
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,028
Excuse you? Go-- Go where?

318
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,196
To the chapel.

319
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,992
We always visit with the ancestors
whenever we come to Thistlehouse.

320
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:20,909
Absolutely not.

321
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,203
You're not going down there. Now begone!

322
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,205
All of you.

323
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,748
You won't be getting my signature,

324
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,667
nor will you ever visit that chapel again.

325
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,253
It is off-limits to anyone but me.

326
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,046
[clears throat]

327
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,023
[speaks in Spanish]

328
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:53,775
Hiram.

329
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,528
What the hell are you doing here?

330
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,574
-I wanna come home.
-You don't live here anymore.

331
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,993
Now, just stop.

332
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,705
Veronica and I are finally free of you.

333
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,457
Is that what freedom looks like?

334
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,794
Playing hostess at a teenager's gin joint?

335
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,342
Let me back in,

336
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,969
you won't have to work
another day ever again.

337
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,348
You'll be my wife again.

338
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,309

-Punishment.

341

For having Tall Boy take potshots at me.

342
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,493

Do you know what the worst thing
you can accuse a writer of being?

515
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,779
A plagiarist.

516
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,031
And based on what?

517
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,160
A story written by
some bottom-feeding dropout

518
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:34,123
in a third-rate school's
so-called literary magazine?

519
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,668
-The text doesn't lie.
-I'm not a thief.

520
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,923
But your father, the sheriff?

521
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,676
He's a thief.

522
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,387
Oh, yes. And much, much worse.

523
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,180
A vagabond.

524
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,432
What is it with you people?

525
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,228
You're given an inch
and you want the whole field.

526
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,816
For God's sake,
do you know who the hell I am?

527
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,320
Do you know what the Baxter Brothers
franchise means to Stonewall Prep?

528
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,531
It built Stonewall Prep.

529
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,449
I built Stonewall Prep.

530
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,535
The record deserves to be set straight.

531
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,121
Get out of my sight now,

532
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,665
while I am still willing to forget
that you had...

533
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,668
the audacity to summon me.

534
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,173
You're very lucky...

535
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,760
I don't take you to the headmaster
and get you expelled

536
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,263
for this vicious and slanderous attack.

537
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,891
Now get out.

538
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,826
[bell jingles]

539
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,705
It's open seating.

540
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,540
Specials are on the board.

541
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,337
Actually, I came to have a little chat...

542
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,173
sister to sister.

543
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,176
Let me guess, Daddy sent you?

544
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,181
One last valiant tactic to get me
back into the family fold?

545
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,228
You're very smart, Veronica.

546
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,107
You don't know our father
as well as you think.

547
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,361
There is literally nothing
you could tell me about Hiram Lodge

548
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,696
that would surprise me.

549
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,537
My <i>mami</i> was a singer
at one of <i>Papi's</i> Miami clubs,

550
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,456
Sala del Oro...

551
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,084
where they met.

552
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,588
-They had a fling.
-Mm-hm.

553
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,757
Tale as old as time.

554
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,719
He took advantage of her, she got
pregnant, he left her high and dry.

555
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,596
Actually, he took care of her...

556
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,723
until she died,

557
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,184
and then he took care of me.

558
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,524
<i>Papi</i> and your mother are renewing
their vows tomorrow,

559
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,234
and they'd like for you to come.

560
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,361
You're kidding.

561
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:12,407
Come or don't, I'm just the messenger.

562
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:22,792
Look... you're entitled
to your opinion of him.

563
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,586
But the father I know...

564
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,755
there's good in him.

565
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,427
So, <i>piénsalo</i>, okay?

566
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,559
[Cheryl] <i>Clearly, I'm going to have to get</i>
<i>the locks changed.</i>

567
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:41,019
Explain to us, Cheryl,

568
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,855
why is there a chain on the chapel's gate?

569
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,858
I told you, Uncle Bedford,
no one's allowed in there but me.

570
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,153
As we suspected,
you're clearly having a psychotic break.

571
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:53,031
-What?
-As soon as we have you declared unfit,

572
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,867
we're selling the factory,
the grounds, everything.

573
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,326
Get out.

574
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,871
Get out, you parasites!

575
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,289
We're going.

576
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,751
Oh, and we will find out whatever it is
you're hiding in our chapel.

577
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,926
[Jughead] <i>You see it, don't you?</i>

578
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:19,098
It certainly appears to be
your grandfather's writing.

579
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,267
It's undeniable.

580
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,103
Mr. Chipping, you have to help me
bring this to light.

581
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,065
We have to prove to everyone
that Mr. DuPont's a fraud.

582
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,609
Look, I understand
that your reputation is on the line

583
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,944
and maybe even your position here
at Stonewall.

584
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,614
But it's the truth, Mr. Chipping,

585
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,324
-and--
-Yes, I'll help you.

586
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:42,205
How could I look myself in the mirror,
as a teacher, as a writer if I didn't?

587
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,339
What the hell?

588
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,722
Mom, we gotta go.

589
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,308
What do you mean? Go where?

590
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,771
I don't know, the Five Seasons maybe.
But you gotta pack a bag

591
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,357
and we gotta get out of here,
at least until things cool down.

592
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,984
-What things, Archie? You're scaring me.
-It's the rec center.

593
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,153
Mom, not everyone's happy about
what we're doing there,

594
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,781
-and I've made some enemies.
-[tires screeching]

595
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,865
Mom, get down!

596
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,867
[automatic gunfire]

597
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,251
[tires screeching]

598
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,848
Hermosa?

599
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,562
What the hell is that?

600
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,483
A painting <i>Papi</i> had commissioned for me.

601
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,194
<i>Papi</i> said to put it in a place of honor.

602
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:00,158
He said, "Only the best
for the apple of my eye."

603
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,494
Of course he did.

604
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,831
I should have known.

605
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,835
You know what?

606
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,755
I was going to tell <i>Papi</i>, as you call him,

607
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,008
that I'd be attending
his bogus vow renewal.

608
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,887
But instead, tell him I'll be skipping it.

609
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:26,434
My mom can roll out the welcome mat for
you two rum-sucking leeches if she wants,

610
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,604
but I'm not giving up my space,
nor my place in this family.

611
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,980
I'm not giving an inch.

612
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,440
Not to you.

613
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,275
Not ever.

614
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,241
[Hiram] <i>I have to admit,</i>
<i>I'm surprised you called, Archie.</i>

615
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,829
Look, there's this criminal
working out of the Wipeout Arcade

616
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,456
named Dodger.

617
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,668
He's a loose cannon,
he needs to be stopped.

618
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,714
And what did this Dodger do exactly?

619
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,300
He shot at my house, at my mom.

620
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,469
Well, that sounds like a job for FP.

621
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,639
Well, I reported what happened, Mr. Lodge,
but Dodger's slippery.

622
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,015
And you know as well as I do,

623
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,643
some things have to be handled
another way.

624
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,354
This is about protecting
what's left of my family.

625
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,563
Of course.

626
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,654
But I hope you're not suggesting
that I commit an act of violence

627
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,655
against this thug.

628
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,533
I am really sorry
about what happened to your mother.

629
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:29,538
But-- Yeah, there's nothing
I can do for you, Archie.

630
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,003
[door closes]

631
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,464
Scholars, uh, as you know,

632
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:43,427
today we will be discussing
Joseph Conrad's<i> Heart of Darkness,</i>

633
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,721
about the loss of a man's moral comp--

634
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,102
Mr. Chipping?

635
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,145
Are you okay?

636
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:58,067
I'm sorry, Jughead,
that I couldn't help you.

637
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,199
-Mr. Chipping!
-[body thudding]

638
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,117
Guys...

639
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,244
Call 911! Call an ambulance!

640
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,204
Call an ambulance!

[creaking noises]

642
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,051
Tee-Tee.

643
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,094
Tee-Tee, awaken!

644
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,179
Do you hear that?

645
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,100
I-- I think it's Julian trying to escape
from the chapel.

646
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,190
He's escaped.

647
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,406
Uncle Bedford?

648
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,787
I always knew there was a...

649
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,665
A certain sickness in our bloodline.

650
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,835
But this, this is monstrous.

651
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:02,214
You are going away
for a long, long time, Cheryl.

652
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,050
Let go of her, you monster!

653
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,679
You are a sick girl, Cheryl,

654
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,223
and I am taking you
to the authorities this instant.

655
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,186
-[gasps]
-Maybe I'll save them the trouble.

656
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,687
[Toni yells]

00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,235
[Cheryl] Tee-Tee.

658
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,874
Hey, how'd it all go?

659
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,001
Smooth as cream, babe.

660
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,129
FP led me right
to where he buried the body,

661
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,591
we moved what was left
and everyone was appropriately grateful.

662
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,303
-Even Betty?
-Even Betty.

663
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,097
That's great.

664
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,185
I love you, babe.

665
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:58,979
I love you, too.

666
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,400
[Cheryl] <i>Why, Aunt Cricket,</i>
<i>whatever can we do for you?</i>

667
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,986
It's Bedford, Cheryl, dear.
He didn't come home last night

668
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,696
and I was wondering if you'd seen him.

669
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,532
He said he might come around Thistlehouse.

670
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,369
-Hm.
-Why, no, we didn't see him.

671
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,288
Oh. Well, you wouldn't mind
if I had a peek around, would you?

672
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,959
Actually, auntie, I would mind.

673
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,421
Unless you have a search warrant
from the local constable in hand?

674
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:24,797
I don't...

675
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,549
but I'll get one.

676
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,592
Good luck with that.

677
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,470
Now, you remember where the door is, yes?

678
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,396
When's Munroe back?

679
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,647
Next week.

680
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,107
Cool.

681
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,693
Crap, Andrews.

682
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,278
What's that?

683
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,753
Holy hell.

684
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,088
Is he dead?

[moaning]

686
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,469
