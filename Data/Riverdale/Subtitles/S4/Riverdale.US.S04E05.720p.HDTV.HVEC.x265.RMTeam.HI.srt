181

[CHARLES, ECHOING] The term
"serial killer" is relatively new.

182
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:58,053
It wasn't until the 1970s

183
00:06:58,056 --> 00:07:00,635
that the phrase "serial
murderer" or "serial homicide..."

184
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:02,462
It's the one in the middle.

[CHARLES, ECHOING]
When defining a serial killer,

190
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,054
it usually refers to someone
who committed three or...

191
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:18,422
None of them did it.

00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:20,592

Nothing.

Isn't that kind of the point?

Actually, they all have
one thing in common.

That I'm a licensed
private investigator.

791
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:21,668
That I was hired by Hiram Lodge

00:34:21,671 --> 00:34:24,579
to uncover any malfeasance against him.

793
00:34:24,581 --> 00:34:27,745

00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:31,658
that the federal
prosecutor colluded with you

795
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:35,014

charges against Hiram.

Yes. I did.

So, here's what happens next.

805
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,709

has already told the judge

806
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:04,233
that she's dropping the
charges against Hiram,

807
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:05,494

891
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:04,330
and I'm winning.

892
00:40:04,332 --> 00:40:05,940
And please, Mr. Chipping, from here on,

893
00:40:05,942 --> 00:40:08,109
you can call me Forsythe, the Third.

894
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:13,335
It's after my grandfather.

895
00:40:13,338 --> 00:40:14,879
[FRANCIS] Wonderful.

896
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:18,419
Then you, and your classmates,
will be challenged to devise

897
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:21,812
the perfect murder.

898
00:40:21,815 --> 00:40:23,245
That's your theme.

899
00:40:24,951 --> 00:40:26,627
Let the bloodbath begin.

900
00:40:29,558 --> 00:40:34,209
_

901
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,380
[FP] Archie Andrews, Betty
Cooper, and Veronica Lodge,

902
00:40:38,383 --> 00:40:39,564
you're under arrest

903
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:42,685
for the cold-blooded murder
of my son, Jughead Jones.
