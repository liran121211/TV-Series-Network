Moose.

4
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,515
What the hell? Wait, are you my roommate?

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,476
Hermione Lodge, you're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder.

6
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,686
Your own husband's.

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,524
<i>Mija,</i> I'm not paying for your crimes.
I told the world what you are.

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,567
Deal with it.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,903
I think you'd make an excellent candidate
for the Junior FBI training program.

10
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,698
So are you warming up
to our half brother now?

11
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,033
[Betty] <i>Yeah. Kind of.</i>

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,326
[Jughead] <i>I'm just glad that Charles</i>
<i>was there for you.</i>

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,704
[Munroe] Didn't you say we'd turn
this place into a community center?

14
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,747
[Archie] Feels like it's time.

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,333
No one is safe here. Is that really
the town that you wanna invest in?

16
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,961
You're not considering
fighting crime in those tights, are you?

17
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,296
Of course not.

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,048
I'm gonna need a mask.

Kev, what are your after-school plans?

34
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,741
Cruising the bathrooms at Sheds and Royal.

35
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,745
Perfect. Then you can join me
for my first Junior FBI class.

36
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,289
The one that
your hot half brother's teaching?

37
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,001
Yes. I asked Charles if you could enroll
and he said everyone's welcome.

38
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,879
Remind me,
is your brother gay or straight?

39
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,842
I actually have no idea.

40
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,261
But seniors from a bunch
of different high schools signed up,

41
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,931
so who knows, maybe you'll meet
a cute, gay FBI agent-in-training.

42
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,058
I'm in. When and where?

43
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,603
It seems that the district attorney
is pinning her entire case

44
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,565
on linking you to Hiram's
would-be murderer, Tall Boy Petite.

45
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,108
Which is absurd.

46
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,652
I've never even had
any interaction with the man.

47
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,072
There is still the issue
of the large sum of money the police found

48
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,408
in your monogrammed Tucci bag
in Tall Boy's apartment.

49
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,368
Obviously, Hiram planted it there
to frame me.

50
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:44,414
FP will testify that he searched
Tall Boy's apartment right after he died.

51
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,333
He'll swear that there was no bag of money
in evidence at that time.

52
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,586
This week is insane.

53
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,298
I've got two papers due,
your trial is starting,

54
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,924
Daddy's trial is around the corner...

55
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,344
I've heard the federal prosecutor's
going after your father pretty hard.

56
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,097
Oh, I know,
I've been meeting with her on the DL.

57
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,099
Goals for this week?

58
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:07,061
Get Mom out of jail
and make sure Daddy stays rotting in his.

[Donna] <i>What are you working on?</i>

60
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,941
The same thing as when
you drugged me, Donna.

61
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,819
Except this time,
I actually found something.

62
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,905
The Stonewall Four
is supposed to be an urban legend,

63
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,073
but when I checked the town paper,

64
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,702
four people had actually gone missing
over the last 30 years.

65
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,203
It's exactly what happened to Moose.

66
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,291
Marmaduke is fine.
He's just busy in basic training.

67
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,792
Look.

68
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,211
We've been texting.

69
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,717
[Chipping] You guys are in for a treat.

70
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,221
Advanced copies of my latest novel.

71
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,724
Doesn't hit stores till Christmas,
so no spoilers.

72
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,729
Wait, Mr. Chipping,
you wrote a Baxter Brothers mystery?

73
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,648
Are you Franklin P. Paxton?

74
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,235
I am. Well, it's my nom de plume.

75
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,696
But <i>The Secret of the Old Windmill</i>
came out like, what, decades ago?

76
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,697
How is that possible?

77
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,952
I am merely the latest in a long line
of ghostwriters over the decades.

78
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,205
My mind is blown. I used to love
these books when I was a kid.

79
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,458
They were my gateway drug
into serious crime fiction.

80
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,709
[scoffs]

81
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,879
[Chipping] Well, then you're in luck.

82
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,257
To celebrate the publication
of <i>Ten Little Boy Scouts,</i>

83
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,051
Stonewall Prep is throwing me
a little wine and cheese,

84
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,636
to which you are all invited.

85
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,889
As are the previous ghostwriters.

86
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,227

<i>♪ Things I said I'd do ♪</i>

88
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,189
What's wrong, Pop?

89
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,858
It's a subpoena.

90
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,528
From your father's defense team.

91
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,612
Oh, no.

92
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,200
They'll probably ask
if you doctored La Bonne Nuit's books

93
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,493
to make my father look guilty.

94
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,619
Which I did.

95
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:50,456
And I have no regrets about that,
Veronica, you needed the help.

96
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,043
But I cannot place my hand on a Bible
and say otherwise.

97
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,879
Let me get into it
with the federal prosecutor.

98
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,632
Don't worry, I won't let you
get caught up in this.

99
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,221
Just when I thought
you couldn't possibly go any lower,

100
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,931
you prove me wrong, Daddy.

101
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,019
Pop Tate is a good man. There is no need
to drag him into the mess of your trial.

102
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,603
I'm fighting for my freedom.

103
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,440
And to be clear,
I didn't drag Pop into this, you did.

104
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,525
Because you were extorting me.

105
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,069
You can spare Pop
and end this right now, <i>mija.</i>

106
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,239
Come clean to the feds,
admit you framed me.

107
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,534
-Hard pass.
-Then I'll be seeing Pop Tate in court.

108
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:31,456
And tell your mom good luck on her case.
I'll be rooting for her.

109
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,630
We have a problem. If Pop takes the stand,
he'll tell the truth.

110
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,132
And before you ask,

111
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,552
no, Ms. Federal Prosecutor,
I won't tell Pop to lie.

112
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,721
Your father's broken many laws.

113
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:50,433
But those books you provided the FBI
proving Hiram's guilt

114
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,935
-are at the heart of our case.
-Call me as a witness.

115
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,106
I'll testify that I was the one
who tasked Pop with doctoring the books

116
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,777
as a last resort because my father
was extorting me, which is the truth.

117
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:09,410
Once I do that, I doubt they'll wanna
spend much time talking about any books.

118
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:13,831
Okay. Meanwhile,
good luck with your mother's case.

119
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,712
For our first session, thought we'd start
in the deep end of the swimming pool.

120
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,130
With serial killers.

121
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,050
Your half brother is so hot.

122
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,428
I've put together a little exercise
to kick us off.

123
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:32,683
This is a crime scene where six victims
were found buried along a riverbank

124
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,893
in the Pacific Northwest.

125
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,979
{\an8}Before I start filling in the details,

126
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,650
any guesses on which one of these men
is the murderer?

127
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,446
It's the third man.

128
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,825
That's correct, Betty.
How did you know that?

129
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,453
I don't know, just intuition?

130
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,163
Okay, then.

131
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,457
Let's try another one.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,669
{\an8}Which one's the serial killer?

133
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,340
{\an8}The term "serial killer"
is relatively new.

134
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,467
{\an8}It wasn't until the 1970s

135
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,303
{\an8}that the phrase "serial murderer"
or "serial homicide"--

136
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,805
It's the one in the middle.

137
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,807
Correct again.

138
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,268
Your intuition is like a sixth sense.

139
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,353
Let's go again.

140
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,233
When defining a serial killer,

141
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,319
it usually refers to someone
who committed three or more murders--

142
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,571
None of them did it.

143
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,364
Excellent work, Betty.

144
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,576
Not many people
have that kind of raw instinct.

145
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,578
You're like <i>Beautiful Mind, </i>but...

146
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,580
for serial killers.

147
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,834
Can any of you guess
what the murderers all have in common?

148
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,004
Nothing. Isn't that kind of the point?

149
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,048
{\an8}They all have one thing in common.

150
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,593
A specific set of genes.

151
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,097
[Alice] They discovered
that you have the MAOA

152
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,934
{\an8}-and the CDH13 genes.
-CDH13, also known as--

153
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,769
The serial killer genes.

154
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:11,115
{\an8}Hey, Dad, have you seen
my Baxter Brothers books?

155
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,367
{\an8}I swear I took them out of the trailer
before it burned.

156
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,786
{\an8}I don't know. Might have thrown them away.

157
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,331
{\an8}You threw away my books?

158
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,375
{\an8}Calm down. Before you accuse me
of book-burning,

159
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,878
{\an8}why don't you check the storage room
in the basement?

160
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,551
{\an8}I used to worship these guys.

161
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,554
{\an8}Other kids wanted to be superheroes,
I wanted to be a Baxter Brother.

162
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,308
{\an8}Oh, my God, they used to do
crossovers with Tracy True.

163
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,560
{\an8}-Those were my favorite, remember?
-[Jughead] Yeah.

164
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,979
{\an8}My dad used to get me one of these
each year for my birthday.

165
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,523
{\an8}Hey, Dad, why'd you stop?

166
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,401
{\an8}You outgrew them, boy.

167
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,529
{\an8}I gotta run.

168
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,198
{\an8}I'm never gonna outgrow these books.

169
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,909
{\an8}-[Betty chuckles]
-[Jughead] This was my favorite.

170
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,415
{\an8}[boy snoring]

171
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,460
{\an8}[Bret] Mm. Jones, lights out.

172
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,379
{\an8}Some of us are trying to sleep.

173
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,028
{\an8}[yawns]

174
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,989
Late night, Red?

175
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,700
{\an8}Algebra 3 is kicking my ass this year.

176
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,285
{\an8}[man] One of you named Archie?

177
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,620
Yeah, that's me.

178
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,247
This kid says you'll vouch for him.

179
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,541
{\an8}That's Toby, he hangs out here.
Is there a problem?

180
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,377
Yeah. He was shoplifting
in my convenience store.

181
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,587
I was reading comics.

182
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,923
{\an8}You were loitering and then you started
to put this comic book in your jacket.

183
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,509
{\an8}Why don't I pay for whatever
that comic book costs?

184
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,760
Four ninety-nine.

185
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,180
{\an8}I don't want any of your delinquents
stepping foot in my shop.

186
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,517
{\an8}It's bad enough
we have to walk by this halfway house.

187
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,272
{\an8}[Munroe] Keep the change.

188
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:09,900
{\an8}Grab a brush.

189
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,119
{\an8}Here is the hero of the hour.

190
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,122
{\an8}Class, this is Francis J. DuPont,

191
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,916
{\an8}the originator
of the Baxter Brothers franchise

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,211
{\an8}and the very first Franklin P. Paxton.

193
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,049
{\an8}Francis, this is Bret, Joan,
Jonathan, Donna and Jughead.

194
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,258
Jughead?

195
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,470
{\an8}-Is that a nickname?
-Yes, sir. It is.

196
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,722
{\an8}And it's an honor to meet you.

197
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,767
{\an8}I didn't have
the greatest home life growing up,

198
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,103
but your books
really helped me through it.

199
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,690
Jughead is the newest addition

200
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,319
to the most promising
group of students I've ever taught.

201
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,989
Really?
Well, is the successor amongst us, then?

202
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,699
Successor for what?

203
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,286
Chipping has written
the last four Baxter Brothers books.

204
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,121
It's time he pass on the torch.

205
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:08,250
Therefore, we're on the hunt for the next
ghostwriter to continue the franchise.

206
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,921
-You're going to pick one of us?
-Keep it in your pants, Jones.

207
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,631
Every Baxter Brothers author,

208
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,759
beginning with Mr. DuPont himself,
has gone to Stonewall Prep.

209
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,096
We're always looking
for young and clever minds

210
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,431
to keep our adventures fresh and relevant.

211
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,060
If you're interested in the job, you'll
have to write the first three chapters

212
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,897
of the next Baxter Brothers novel
and an outline for the rest of it.

213
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,357
[Bret] Obviously, I'm winning this.

214
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,235
Is there any particular style
or subject area?

215
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,739
We have not yet decided on a theme,
but we'll let you know.

216
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,373
I pulled your files, Miss Cooper.

217
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:52,795
I can confirm that you do have
the MAOA and CDH13 genes.

218
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,552
All good. Nothing to worry about.
I don't have the genes.

219
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,388
See, I told you. What a relief.

220
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,613
You gotta be kidding me.

221
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,040
Hey, get the hell away from that car!

222
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,309
Who are you?

223
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,776
You run with Dodger?

224
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,779
Get the hell out of here. Go!

225
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,324
Tell him it's over.
Tell him he's done for!

226
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:20,883
All right, listen up.

227
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,929
Sheriff Jones gave us a call.

228
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,098
Apparently, some of Dodger's crew
was stealing hubcaps last night.

229
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,351
He suspects it was someone
from this center.

230
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,312
I gave him my word that it wasn't
any of you guys, and I hope that's true.

231
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,272
Anyone running with Dodger's crew

232
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,526
is going to end up in juvie
or in an early grave.

233
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,528
Trust us, you don't wanna go to juvie.

234
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,656
If even one of you guys gets arrested,
this whole place gets shut down.

235
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,660
So, new rule: If you run with Dodger's
crew, then you're not welcome here.

236
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,537
That's it. No exceptions.

237
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:50,996
Any questions?

238
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,623
Yeah, I got a question.

239
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,833
Aren't you guys seniors?

240
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,002
What happens when you graduate
and go to college?

241
00:13:58,837 --> 00:13:59,922
That's months away.

242
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,967
But what happens? You said it yourself,
they're trying to shut you down.

243
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,012
Why? Because of us. Because no one
wants us. At least Dodger cares.

244
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,348
Dodger only cares
about the money you can bring in.

245
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,560
We want you here, but you can't have it
both ways. You have to choose.

246
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,820
[Charles] One thing we see
in a lot of serial killers

247
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,239
are instances of animal cruelty
in their youth.

248
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,908
Jeffrey Dahmer, the cannibal of Milwaukee,

249
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,786
started killing dogs
when he was in grade school.

250
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,623
Ian Brady, the infamous Moors murderer,
killed his first cat when he was 10.

251
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,668
I'm all the dark deeds you did
in our youth,

252
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,296
like what we did to our old cat, Caramel.

253
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,633
Caramel ran away.
I didn't do anything to her.

254
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,970
Oh, Betty, we both know
that we drowned Caramel.

255
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,473
[Charles] Robert Thompson tied rabbits
to railway tracks.

256
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,726
Betty, are you okay?

257
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,604
I need to get some air. Sorry.

258
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,563
[Charles] Okay.

259
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,320
[FP] <i>I arrived at the cabin alone.</i>

260
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,448
The suspect, Tall Boy, got violent.

261
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,785
Resisted arrest. And unfortunately,
I had to discharge my weapon.

262
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,788
He expired on his way to the hospital.

263
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,083
And later, when you searched
Tall Boy's motel room,

264
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,545
did you find Hermione Lodge's Tucci bag
full of cash?

265
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,088
No.

266
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,425
And yet, the prosecution claims
they found the bag there.

267
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,386
-If it was, it was planted later.
-Thank you, sheriff.

268
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,889
Your witness, counselor.

269
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,102
The cabin where you claim
to have shot Tall Boy,

270
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,646
do you know who owns that cabin?

271
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,564
I assumed it was Hiram's.

272
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,068
This is a copy of the lease.
Kindly read the owner's name.

273
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,077
"Hermione Lodge."

274
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,828
[crowd murmuring]

275
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,538
-[Judge] Order.
-[gavel banging]

276
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,456
Order.

277
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,477
[Jughead] <i>Excuse me, Mr. DuPont.</i>

278
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,106
Did you happen to know my grandfather?

279
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,609
Forsythe Jones the First?

280
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,489
That is why you look familiar.

281
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,617
Your grandfather was an excellent writer.

282
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,996
Tell me, how's he doing?
Does he still write?

283
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,499
I... I actually don't know.
I've never met him.

284
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,293
Up until this exact moment,
I didn't even know he was a writer.

285
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,712
A bit of a brawler, too.

286
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,799
Forsythe got into all kinds of
rabble-rousing before he left Stonewall.

287
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,510
Is that why he left?
He was kicked out for fighting?

288
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,972
Oh, It was so long ago,
I don't remember the exact circumstances.

289
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,558
But I will never forget his talent.

290
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:01,645
We would read his works in class and
I couldn't believe a teenager wrote them.

291
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,940
-Does your father write?
-No, he's a sheriff.

292
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,361
Would you invite your father
to the reception tomorrow?

293
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,114
I would love to meet Forsythe's son.

294
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,075
Yeah, I'll see if he can come.

295
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:18,787
Thank you.

296
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,334
Mrs. Andrews is back-channeling
with the DA's office.

297
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,045
They're talking plea deals.

298
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:30,924
Mom... why didn't you tell us
that the cabin was under your name?

299
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,093
Because it wasn't.

300
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:38,057
Veronica, your father must have forged
a lease or a contract or something.

301
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,102
So, then why didn't you say
that you'd never even been to this cabin?

302
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:44,938
Because I have.

303
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,276
[gunshots]

304
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,405
Mom, it's now or never.

305
00:17:55,949 --> 00:18:00,496
I need you to tell me the truth
about everything so I can help you.

306
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,209
[Mary] If everything you've told me
is true, then I have no moves left.

307
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,295
The more the prosecutor digs,
the guiltier you'll be.

308
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,590
And that's for crimes
that aren't even on their radar yet.

309
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,718
There's no magic wand
that makes this just go away.

310
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,762
What if there were one?

311
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,181
And my mother changed her plea to guilty?

312
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,643
-Veronica--
-Look, Mom, we've gotta be realistic here.

313
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,063
Why not admit
to what everyone already knows,

314
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,733
before something else,
something worse comes out?

315
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,821
Veronica, your mother would go to prison
probably for the rest of her life.

316
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,199
Not if we get someone
with a magic wand to pardon her.

317
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,201
[Mary] That can only happen
at the state level.

318
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,995
So unless you're friends
with Governor Dooley...

319
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:46,792
I wouldn't say friends exactly,
but we do have a history.

320
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:48,752
All of us.

321
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,857
[cat whining]

322
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,444
Hey, are you okay?

323
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,656
What are you doing?

324
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:21,869
No!

325
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,498
Caramel.

326
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:31,962
[knock on door]

327
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,798
[Jughead] Hey.

328
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,218
You free for lunch?
You wanna go to Pop's and get a burger?

329
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,929
I got a lot on my mind. What's up?

330
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,641
I wanted to ask you about Grandpa.
Did you know he was a writer?

331
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,686
Yeah.

332
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,938
Where'd you hear that?

333
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,191
Oh, one of his old classmates
is visiting Stonewall Prep.

334
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,651
They have a reception later,
if you wanna come hang out.

335
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,947
Waste a day with a bunch of blue bloods
who think they're better than me? No.

336
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,325
You're the one that pushed me
to go to Stonewall Prep.

337
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,328
Hell, you'd probably make me put on
a tie and a blazer.

338
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:08,874
And just so you know, my old man
wasn't a writer, he was a dropout.

339
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,293
All right? He couldn't hold down a job.

340
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:16,590
He was a mean, mean drunk who took all
of his anger out on me and your grandma.

341
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,092
Was the best day of my life
when he skipped out on us.

342
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:23,513
So, do I wanna hear about what a great
writer he was back in high school? No.

343
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,682
No, I'm...

344
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,727
I'm good with my memories
but you have fun.

345
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,609
[door closes]

346
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,785
Governor Dooley! You made it.

347
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,996
-Oh, no, not again.
-Yes, again.

348
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,415
I have a small favor to ask you.

349
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,127
I was told this meeting
was requested by the FBI.

350
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,297
No, I'd rather keep the FBI out of this,
if at all possible.

351
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,635
So, in this folder,
you'll find evidence that paints

352
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,929
a rather corrupt portrait of you,
governor.

353
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,350
Ordering a bogus quarantine.
Accepting drug money as a bribe.

354
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,477
Receiving kickbacks from my father's jail.

355
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,731
Young lady, how many times do you think
you can blackmail me?

356
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,193
Help me now and this will be the last.
I'll put that in writing.

357
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,445
As you know, my mother's on trial.

358
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,491
If she pleads guilty, I need you
to grant her a pardon, immediately.

359
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,412
In exchange, I won't release this file
of incriminating evidence.

360
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,208
What do you say, Donald?
Once more for old time's sake?

361
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,463
[DuPont tapping on glass]

362
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,340
May I have your attention?

363
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:44,886
In Literary Society tradition,
it wouldn't be a proper reunion

364
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,264
without a little game of murder.

365
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,475
[Chipping] For neophytes,
the rules are as follows:

366
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,102
Everyone draws a card.

367
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,607
Whoever picks "murderer"
must walk amongst us,

368
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,943
winking at their prey.

369
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,448
If you are winked at,
you die five seconds later.

370
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,250
The object of the game of course is to
identify the murderer before being killed.

371
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,711
Happy hunting, everybody.

372
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,174
[Donna] Enjoying yourself, Jones?

373
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,886
So, this is what one-percenters do
for fun. They play murder, huh?

374
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,763
Oh, by the way...

375
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,182
Wicked, Jones.

376
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,435
-I should--
-Yeah, go on, then. Let me die in peace.

377
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,192
[groans]

378
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,030
[boy] Nicely done.

379
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,033
[Chipping] Down to the wire, boys.

380
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,872
[coughs and chokes, then body thuds]

381
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,667
-It's Jughead. He's the murderer!
-Because I just killed you.

382
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,503
I knew it was him beforehand. I win.

383
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,963
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Because you're dead.

384
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,967
-No, I'm not, I--
-[DuPont] Boys. Let's be men about this.

385
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,553
It's clear that Jughead Jones
won the game, fair and square.

386
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,556
-And what a formidable murderer he was.
-Wha...

387
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,016
[all clapping]

388
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,360
I'm disappointed
I didn't get to meet your father.

389
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,654
Oh, yeah. He's been busy with work.

390
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,030
Oh, I understand.

391
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,283
I hope you'll enter the contest
to be our new ghostwriter.

392
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:34,913
I mean, the grandson of Forsythe Jones
would be a worthy inheritor of the mantle.

393
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,124
[Charles] <i>Serial killers are compulsive.</i>

394
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,627
They leave clues, take trophies,
keep records.

395
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,673
Journals, diaries, letters.

396
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,592
They see themselves as the hero
in their own stories.

397
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,179
Sometimes it's difficult for them to
distinguish between reality and fantasy,

398
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,806
fact and fabrication.

399
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,352
By studying childhood diaries
of serial killers,

400
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:00,355
we can gain invaluable insight
into how their minds work.

401
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,959
Your Honor,
in lieu of a closing statement,

402
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,836
my client would like to say something.

403
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,379
Proceed.

404
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:33,346
Your Honor, after careful consideration,
I've decided to change my plea.

405
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,641
I, Hermione Apollonia Lodge...

406
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,562
plead guilty to the charges against me.

407
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,814
[crowd murmuring]

408
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,408
[Betty] I lied to you, Kevin.

409
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:57,120
At the hospital, Dr. Patel told me
that I do have the genes.

410
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,497
And there's more.

411
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,045
Something that I think
I may have repressed.

412
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,257
Do you remember my cat, Caramel?

413
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,639
A car hit her.

414
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,517
<i>-And I found her on our front lawn.</i>
-[Caramel whining]

415
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,061
She was in pain.

416
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,729
Dying.

417
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,526
And it sounded like someone screaming.

418
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,614
<i>So I went to get my dad for help.</i>

419
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,242
<i>And he took me back outside.</i>

420
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,495
[Hal] Caramel is your cat, Betty.

421
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,206
You need to take care of this.

422
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,541
And he handed me a rock.

423
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,050
And he made me...

424
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,430
[Caramel squeals]

425
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,724
[Hal] Good girl, Betty.

426
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,060
Very good girl.

427
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,354
I killed Caramel.

428
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,440
No, Betty, that wasn't you.

429
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,735
That was your deeply screwed-up dad.

430
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,612
Oh, and I'm not screwed up?

431
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,533
I'm repressing memories
of killing animals, Kevin.

432
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:23,498
Betty, I think this FBI training might
be getting a little too intense right now.

433
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:28,628
I think we should
maybe consider withdrawing.

434
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,216
[Archie] That's it, keep your hands up.

435
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,677
Protect your face.

436
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,721
[Munroe] Jab, jab.

437
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,347
Good job.

438
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,932
[Archie] Keep those hands up.

439
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,601
That's it.

440
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,439
[FP] Hey, Red, you got a minute?

441
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,190
[Archie] Sure. What's up, Mr. Jones?

442
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,027
Some of the local business owners

443
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,987
have lodged a few complaints
against your center.

444
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,240
Littering, vandalism, public urination.

445
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,910
Due respect, Mr. Jones, that's BS.

446
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,414
I'm here every morning and I lock up
every night. These kids aren't doing that.

447
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,542
When I rolled with the Serpents,
we dealt with the same crap.

448
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,379
Wherever we set up, complaints followed.
No one wants a gang around.

449
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,674
The problem isn't the kids, it's the thugs
that show up after we lock up.

450
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:18,303
They're gnarly. This place is supposed
to make the neighborhood better.

451
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,598
Well, show them that.
Do what the Serpents used to do.

452
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,934
Invite some of the yokels over
for a get-to-know-you clambake.

453
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:29,189
People are less likely to call the cops
if they've had a conversation with you.

454
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,315
All right?

455
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,656
You think you really pulled something off
at the reception, don't you?

456
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,787
Bret, Bret, Bret. Are you really still mad
about that murder game?

457
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,876
All right.
Well, if it means that much to you...

458
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,295
Poof.

459
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,464
Consider yourself
raised from the dead, preppy.

460
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,757
"Preppy."

461
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,469
You turn your nose up at us,
you scorn us for our privilege.

462
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,807
But the only reason you're here is because
some school benefactors

463
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,934
thought it'd look good
to take on a charity case.

464
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,936
Some dirt-poor scholarship kid.

465
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,939
I'm here because of my writing.
Just get over it.

466
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,900
No, Jughead, you're not here
because of your talent.

467
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,360
The admissions committee?

468
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,862
None of them have read
a single word you've ever written.

469
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:22,158
You're a statistic, a project.
Every year there's one of you.

470
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,829
Some welfare freeloader
who never amounts to anything.

471
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,998
Just like your grandfather.
He couldn't even make it a semester.

472
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,085
That is your past,
present and future, Jughead.

473
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,713
Shut your mouth!

474
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,049
Looks like you've inherited
his temper, too, huh?

475
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,764
They all know I'm right.
And deep down, you know it, too.

476
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,160
Most of you know me by now,
but my name's Archie Andrews.

477
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,995
I run this place with Munroe Moore.

478
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,166
And we invited you here today to set
the record straight about a few things.

479
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,792
Starting with...

480
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,045
Despite a few bogus complaints
that have been made...

481
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,758
this community center
isn't going anywhere.

482
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:24,012
In fact, starting today,
we will be expanding our hours to 11 p.m.

483
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,555
and we'll be open on Sundays.

484
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,516
So, to my neighbors, I say:

485
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,603
Instead of working against us,
why don't you come in and help out?

486
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,397
Sponsor a baseball team. Donate your time.

487
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,776
These kids need people
to show them that they care.

488
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,945
Which is why we're starting
a Big Brothers and Big Sisters program.

489
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,866
The Riverdale High Bulldogs and Vixens
have already volunteered,

490
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,825
so why don't you?

491
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,120
And if you still wanna shut us down,
then go ahead and try.

492
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,872
My mom is a very good lawyer.

493
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,582
Or you can try the cops.

494
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,001
I'll call my best friend's dad,
the sheriff of Riverdale.

495
00:29:55,627 --> 00:30:00,548
Otherwise, my friendly advice to you
is get out of my way.

496
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:09,307
-[Archie] Can I help you?
-Look, I own the hardware store on Drury.

497
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,643
And I admire what you're trying
to accomplish here.

498
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:12,977
And I'm not the only one.

499
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,687
So, why didn't you say that, then?

500
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:19,275
The thing is, many of us business owners
are getting... pressured

501
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,944
to speak out against your center.

502
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,070
Not by Hiram Lodge?

503
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,572
No. Um...

504
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,366
His name is Dodger.

505
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,743
And we've been paying him
a protection fee.

506
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,745
Lately, he's added a request.

507
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,541
Protest your center...
or risk losing his protection.

508
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,293
And then maybe our stores get robbed

509
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:38,878
or burned to the ground.

510
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,881
So Dodger's the one
who wants us out of here.

511
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,219
Every kid who sets foot in your place
is one less running scams

512
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,470
for him on the streets.

513
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,272
Well... look what the cat dragged in.

514
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,775
I'm done with Stonewall Prep.
That place is toxic.

515
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,987
I'm going back to Riverdale High
to be with my friends.

516
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,530
Nope. Mm-mm.

517
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,241
You're not throwing away this opportunity.

518
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,077
You're giving me whiplash, Dad.
What opportunity?

519
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,162
So I can be buried alive in a coffin?

520
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,749
Or be told that I'm only there
because I grew up in a trailer park?

521
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,294
-Someone said that to you?
-Yeah, Bret did.

522
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:23,131
Well, who cares how you got in? You're in.

523
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,633
And those silver spoons?
They feel threatened.

524
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,970
Look, this Bret kid?
He knows you're better than him,

525
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,638
that you're gonna leave him in the dust.

526
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,517
And you'll do it
without the privilege or the fancy name.

527
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:38,813
But if you drop out now,
you're no better than my old man.

528
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,650
If you hated him so much,
then why would you name me after him?

529
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,985
It's my name, too, don't forget.

530
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,821
And, yeah, I hate him,
but he's still my old man,

531
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,740
so that's gotta count for something, huh?

532
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:52,744
Also...

533
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,957
those books weren't from me.

534
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,961
Your grandad sent them from...
wherever the hell he was.

535
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,464
I didn't tell you because...

536
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,217
Because I'm still angry
at how he treated us.

537
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,471
Now, he was a hard man
and there was no love lost between us,

538
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,474
but I gotta give the devil his due.
Those books you love...

539
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,476
were from him.

540
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,940
-And you have no idea where he is now?
-No.

541
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,151
-Do you want me to look for him?
-No, I don't.

542
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,322
But I'll tell you what I do want.
I want you to go back.

543
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:35,161
I want you to do what my father never did,
what I never did. Graduate high school.

544
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:40,500
Show those preppies
what it means to be a Jones man.

545
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,877
Bring honor to our name.

546
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,266
I'm quitting the program, Charles.

547
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,979
-But you're a natural.
-That's the problem. It's too easy for me.

548
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,148
I could identify every single killer
in your slideshow.

549
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,068
Because I'm like them.

550
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,321
I have the same genes as them.

551
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,868
All the more reason for you
to stay in the program.

552
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,329
To make sense of that part of yourself.

553
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,416
You couldn't understand, okay?
You just don't get it.

554
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,500
I can.

555
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,502
And I do, Betty.

556
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,589
I have the genes, too.

557
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,134
In fact, it's why I joined the FBI.

558
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,844
To control those impulses.

559
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,431
You have the serial killer genes?

560
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,602
Yeah. You can use this. Harness this.

561
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,396
To keep the darkness in check.

562
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,857
I did.

563
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,781
[Veronica] Oh, that's amazing news.

564
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,451
Thank you so much, governor,
I really appreciate it.

565
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,955
No, that's fine.
I'll pick her up myself. Bye now.

566
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,502
Sounds like you just got some good news.

567
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,004
Yes, I did.

568
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,508
My mother's been away for a while
and she's finally coming home.

569
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,844
Same as your father.

570
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:20,725
-I'm sorry, do I know you?
-No, you do not.

571
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,731
But I'll tell you the same thing
I told the federal prosecutor.

572
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,108
That I'm a licensed private investigator.

573
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:34,572
That I was hired by Hiram Lodge
to uncover any malfeasance against him.

574
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:39,452
And that I can unequivocally prove
that the federal prosecutor

575
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:45,041
colluded with you to frame
and bring false charges against Hiram.

576
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,002
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is.

577
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:53,341
I have many recordings
of you two... plotting.

578
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:59,555
Including a conversation you two had
at that booth over there...

579
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,934
discussing Pop Tate's subpoena.

580
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,727
You had my place bugged?

581
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,354
Yes, I did.

582
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,440
So, here's what happens next.

583
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,818
The federal prosecutor
has already told the judge

584
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,654
that she's dropping the charges
against Hiram,

585
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:18,366
thanks to information I provided.

586
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:23,996
Look... whatever Hiram's paying you,
I'll double it.

587
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,665
Nice try.

588
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,793
But that won't work with me.

589
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:34,799
You see, our father needed help,
someone he could trust,

590
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,217
so he had me come up from Miami.

591
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,677
I fix things.
