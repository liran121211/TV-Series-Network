-What were you doing in there?

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,221
I was... praying.

3
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,141
My team's been investigating
Edgar Evernever for quite some time now.

4
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:17,851
We had someone on the inside.

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,894
Someone tasked
with getting close to Edgar.

6
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,647
[Betty] My mother is an FBI informant?

7
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,525
Charles, what if that means
she's been found out?

8
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,569
You should go to Stonewall Prep, Jug.

9
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:28,862
Look me in the eye and tell me

10
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,448
you don't wanna go to a school
that recognizes your talent.

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,116
Hey. Are you Forsythe?

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,159
Yeah.

13
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,869
Bret Weston Wallis.

14
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,912
Mr. Chipping asked me to roll out
the red carpet.

15
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,165
The Lodge name is tainted.

16
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:43,126
But my mother's maiden name, Gomez?
I think I could work with that.

17
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,212
But I did see Edgar.
And, Betty, he's armed.

18
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,424
Edgar's digging in.
He's getting ready for war.

[Munroe] Sit your butt down
and don't move.

22
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,807
You need to chill out, okay?

23
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,309
Nothing happened.

24
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,353
-Everything all right, Munroe?
-Anything but.

25
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,230
Malcolm's been hanging out
at Wipeout Arcade.

26
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,815
So?

27
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,026
That place is crawling
with dealers and fiends,

28
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,403
and I don't want him
getting mixed up in that.

29
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,701
Didn't you say we were gonna turn
this place into a community center, Red?

30
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,621
We are. I still plan on it. But...

31
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,332
life kind of threw me a curveball.

32
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,251
But you're right.

33
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,545
It feels like it's time.

34
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,718
[Jellybean] Found it.

35
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,597
Oh.

36
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,059
Well, we are certainly not
in Riverdale High anymore.

37
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,062
Welcome to the Dead Poets Society.

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,772
Not a bad coop, boy.

39
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,738
Okay, kid.
Let's go find the vending machine.

40
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,448
I'll buy you some Triple Bubble.

41
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,536
You still okay with this?

42
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:01,830
Yeah.

43
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,791
I'm just gonna miss you, that's all.

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,086
Well, you better take your breaks
from me while you can, Cooper.

45
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,922
'Cause you and I are in this
for the long haul, okay?

46
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,345
I don't know what happened.

47
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,597
I thought I wanted to sign the document

48
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,600
and officially change my name
to Veronica Gomez, but...

49
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,936
in the moment, I just couldn't do it.

50
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,980
If it didn't feel right,
it didn't feel right.

51
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,356
I still wanna do it.

52
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,818
I just need to figure out
who I'm going to be.

53
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,488
And you will. In the meantime,
you wanna come with me to the gym?

54
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,449
I'm meeting with Ms. Weiss about turning
the place into a community center.

55
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,450
Of course.

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,369
Do we need to leave now?

57
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,789
I mean, we got some time.

58
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,676

59
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,095

It's good to see you.

62
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,811
Actually, it's, uh... It's Marmaduke now.

63
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:08,396
Marmaduke.

64
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,233
Wait, are you my roommate?
What are you doing here, dude?

65
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,572
After my dad was arrested
for impersonating the Gargoyle King,

66
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,493
it, uh... kind of blew up my life,
my family.

67
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,289
Everything.
I kind of had a nervous breakdown.

68
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,584
Ended up in a facility
for a couple months.

69
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,044
-Oh, man...
-When I got out,

70
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,296
we decided it'd be better
if I started someplace new,

71
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:34,672
someplace fresh.

72
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,259
So, I took a year off and came here
to play football and start over.

73
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,220
Well, are you feeling any better?

74
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,765
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I-- I--
You know, I feel like a person again.

75
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,893
Like this-- This darkness is off me.

76
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,521
But please just keep this between us,
okay?

77
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,150
If some of these guys got a whiff
of who I was...

78
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,695
No. Your secret is safe with me,
Marmaduke.

79
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,738
Thanks, man.

80
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,450
And we'll need to be
especially tight-lipped around Bret.

81
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,368
[Bret] You rang?

82
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,162
Forsythe, welcome.

83
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,039
-Lovely to see you again.
-Yeah, you, too.

84
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,791
I see you've met our roommate.

85
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,502
Uh, yeah, Marmaduke and I were
just getting acquainted.

86
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,130
Well, it's about time for seminar.
Did you do the reading?

87
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,010
Munroe and I will group the kids
for boxing and MMA lessons

88
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,054
-according to age.
-Keep the gym open until 10,

89
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,306
so kids like my brother have a place
to hang after school

90
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,308
and keep them off the streets
before they go home.

91
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,643
Well, that all sounds wonderful.

92
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,896
I just want you to be aware of
how much work this will actually entail.

93
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,189
What about school, Archie?

94
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,108
Mr. Keller will be here during the day.

95
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,069
Archie, when was the last time
the gym had a safety inspection?

96
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,196
If this is really gonna be
a community center,

97
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,906
there are updates you'll have to do.

98
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,866
At minimum, adding a second bathroom.

99
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,493
Oh, that sounds expensive.

100
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,203
We'll figure it out, Mom.

101

Thanks to your friend Kevin's intel,

103
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,502
I've had this derelict motel
under 24-hour surveillance.

104
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,797
According to city records,
it's owned by one of Edgar's followers.

105
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,592
And... look who's answering
the front door.

106
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,847
Great. If we know where they are,
then what are we waiting for?

107
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,349
-Have you ever heard of Waco, Betty?
-[man] Charles.

108

Check this out.

109
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,439
The Farm's been getting pizza deliveries
every day about the same time.

110
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,108

about to make a delivery as we speak.

<i>you're usually more clever than that.</i>

124

<i>I know all your secrets.</i>

125
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,934
<i>Don't send anyone else in,</i>

It's like she scratching inside the walls.

Babe...

134
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,844
it worries me, leaving the twins alone
with her while we're at school.

135
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,222
Maybe we should hire a caretaker for her.

136
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,518
And have a stranger living amongst us?
Sticking their noses into our business?

137
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,061
Absolutely not.

138
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,605
We're all doing just fine.

{\an8}are sleeping soundly in the nursery.

149
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,635
{\an8}I'm looking at around 40 grand to pay
for the renovations that the gym needs.

150
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,014
{\an8}I hate to say it again,
but I could just lend you the money.

151
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,641
{\an8}No, Ronnie,
I don't wanna take any more handouts.

152
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,811
{\an8}I wanna work for it. I just need
to figure out what that work can be.

153
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,313
We could host a charity concert.

154
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,814
We could have a bake sale.

155
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,066
{\an8}You're gonna have to sell
a lot of cupcakes.

156

Now, hold on. I think B's on to something.

157

{\an8}-What's the haul, Ronnie?
-A little over 4.

177
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,545
{\an8}Grand? That's great.

178
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,712
{\an8}Hundred, Archie.

179
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,800
{\an8}I think I overestimated the financial pull
of your pectorals.

180
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,012
{\an8}Hey! We're just getting started.

181
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,140
{\an8}Maybe we can do a Magic Mike Night
at La Bonne Nuit.

182
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,811
{\an8}Or, dare I say...

183
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,063
{\an8}you boys go <i>The Full Monty?</i>

184
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,818
{\an8}We'll figure something out. We always do.

185
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,070
[cell phone rings]

186
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,991
{\an8}Oh, my God, Mom. I was so worried.

187
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,953
{\an8}[on phone] <i>No, Betty. It's me, Edgar.</i>

188
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,831
{\an8}-How did you get my mom's phone?
-[Edgar laughs]

189
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,209
{\an8}I suspected we had a pretender
in our midst.

190
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,879
{\an8}When I started cutting
people's fingers off,

191
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,132
<i>your mother admitted to me it was her.</i>

192
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,259
{\an8}I have a list of demands.

193
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,053
I'm listening.

194
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,639
{\an8}I need $250,000...

195
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,810
{\an8}passports for each and every one
of my followers,

196
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,938
{\an8}food, water and a bus

197
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,481
<i>for transport.</i>

198
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,818
{\an8}Why did you call me?
Why didn't you call Charles?

199
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,113
{\an8}Because I think you'll have a better
chance convincing him than I will.

200
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,451
{\an8}You have five hours.

201
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,921
{\an8}Charles, I just heard from Edgar.

202
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,133
"My mother has asked me to help her
with the turkey

203
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,638
{\an8}and I wonder, vaguely, when she'll die."

204
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,267
{\an8}Discussion is open.
What is everyone's take on Bret's story?

205
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,562
{\an8}In a word, "astonishing."

206
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,690
Yeah, agreed. It's brilliant.

207
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,359
Thank you, Jonathan.

208
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,946
{\an8}-What did you think, roomie?
-Yeah, it was good.

209
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,948
It was good? [snickers]

210
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,200
Got a real Harold Bloom here.

211
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,244
{\an8}Don't hold back, Jones. I'm a big boy.
I can take it.

212
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:06,999
{\an8}To be honest...

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,001
{\an8}it wasn't really my taste.

214
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,421
{\an8}I thought it was, uh, Salinger-derivative.

215
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,675
{\an8}Thank you for that constructive criticism,
Forsythe.

216
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,304
Mind if I give you my thoughts on your
story? What was it? "The Gremlin King."

217
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,389
"Gargoyle King."

218
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,891
I thought it was puerile,
a tawdry waste of time.

219
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,643
I mean, it's pulp.

220
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,186
Pulp is not an insult to me.

221
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,564
Not to mention your prose reads
more like a preteen journaling

222
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,775
about his abandonment issues
than a coherent narrative.

223
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,027
Hey, hey, hey. Keep it clean, guys.

224
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,740
Taste aside, all good writing does have
one thing in common:

225
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,118
authenticity.

226
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,744
That's my problem, then.

227
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,666
I can't relate to Jughead's work
because I'm not from his world.

228
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,295
I don't have any experience with lowlives
or criminals or trailer trash.

229
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,881
Oh, no? I could give you the crash course
in about five seconds.

230
00:11:55,965 --> 00:12:00,302
Jughead. There is a zero-tolerance
violence policy at Stonewall Prep.

231
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,762
Do you hear me?

232
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,516
Nana, babies, I'm home!

233
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:12,565
And who, pray tell, are you, interloper?

234
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,109
Hello, you must be Cheryl.

235
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,444
Hey.

236
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,654
Babe, don't be mad, but this is Darius.

237
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,407
He's a night nurse I found online.

238
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,826
I thought he could help with Nana
and the kids.

239
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:29,248
Fine. But you will do as you're told,
nothing less, nothing more.

240
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,294
You may tend to Nana, where she is...

241
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,087
but you are not...

242
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:39,508
repeat, not to go into the Blossom chapel
in the basement.

243
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,470
It is forbidden.

244
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,680
Sacred.

245
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,223
[Toni] Don't sweat it, D.

246
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,267
Not even I'm allowed to go in there.

247
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,936
Do we understand each other, Darius?

248
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,147
Absolutely, Miss Cheryl.

249
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,031
Dude, there's a tie on the door!

250
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,159
I'm-- I'm-- I'm just not used to this.
I'm sorry.

251
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,248
Donna.

252
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,295
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm not one for gossip, so...

253
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,256
I don't care if you are.
I'm not ashamed of anything I do.

254
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,301
But a word of advice, newbie:

255
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,387
I'd watch your back around Bret.

256
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:26,931
Why? What is his deal?

257
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,307
He's a diplo-brat.

258
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,267
Son of a diplomat.

259
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,103
Thinks it gives him immunity
to do whatever he wants.

260
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,941
-Like beat me up?
-That's not how Bret fights, okay?

261
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,736
It's psychological with him.
And he's not afraid to play dirty.

262
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,322
Okay. I'll take your advice.

263
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,450
[Donna] Bye, Marmaduke.

264
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,035
Catch you later.

265
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,124
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:00,339
-Loo-- I thought you were...
-I like guys and girls. Cool?

267
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,758
Yeah, totally. I'll...

268
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,761
keep an eye on the doorknob.

269
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,891
What happened?
What did Governor Dooley say?

270
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,309
Same thing that he's been saying.

271
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,936
That we can't give Edgar what he demands

272
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,272
and he will not negotiate
with a cult leader.

273
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:21,193
Is he kidding? What about Mom and--?
And Polly? And all of the other Farmies?

274
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,903
[cell phone ringing]

275
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,906
It's Edgar. What do I say?

276
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,367
You need to buy us time, okay?
I'll walk you through it.

277
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,287

We're unable to meet any demands

unless he releases a hostage
as a sign of good will.

282
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:45,134

No, stop.

Oh, my God.

295
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,624
Polly, stay calm. We'll figure it out.

296

-Tell him to stay back!
-Charles, stay back.

-Please. Please.
-[Charles] She has a dead man's switch.

If she lets go, the bomb explodes.

00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,508
Okay. Polly, I know Edgar must have
said something to you, okay?

300
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,553
But it doesn't-- It doesn't matter,
I know you don't wanna do this.

301
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,015
I know you don't want Juniper and Dagwood
to grow up without a mom

302
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,727
or me without a sister, okay?
So, we're gonna figure it out, okay?

303
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,188
-Okay. What do we do?
-Betty, look at the timer.

304
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,773
There's wires connected to the C-4.

305
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,359
Three of those are decoys.
They'll trigger the detonator.

306
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,693
Find the one that's linked

307

-to the firing circuit and the battery.
-Firing circuit and the battery.

-Yeah.

Um... Firing circuit and the battery.

Firing circuit and the battery.

It's the yellow--
It's the yellow one. It's the yellow--

It's counting down even faster!

It's a tripwire! There might be
a system override on the switch.

320
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,223
A pin connected to a chain.

321
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,475
It slides beneath the hole,
goes underneath the trigger.

322
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,310
-Polly, where's the pin?
-Edgar took it.

323

-He took the pin.
-Everybody, get down!

Scholars, I'm canceling
this afternoon's seminar.

330
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,920
Instead, we will be having
an evening session.

331
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,215
You've each been given a copy
of the same mystery story

332
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,636
with the final chapter omitted, in which
the murderer's identity would be revealed.

333
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,640
You're each to write your own version
of the ending.

334
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,809
In whatever style you choose.

335
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:03,731
We will then read all the endings
and decide the winner by vote.

336
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,773
Best story wins?

337
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,525
Challenge accepted.

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,863
What exactly will this so-called exercise
prove, Mr. Chipping?

339
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,658
That there is no single way
to tell a story, Donna.

340
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,119
So...

341
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,122
see you back here by 9 p.m.

342
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,250
Don't be late.

343
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,632
[Munroe] Red! We gotta go!

344
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,635
-We gotta get these guys now!
-What are you talking about?

345
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,306
Malcolm. Got jumped by some thugs
for not making deliveries.

346
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,434
He wasn't even hanging at the arcade.
He listened to me and he still got hurt.

347
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,894
Is he gonna be okay?

348
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,396
He's a tough kid. He's seen worse.

349
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,483
Malcolm said that the thugs worked
for some guy named Dodger.

350
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,984
He recruits kids from the arcade,

351
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,612
gets them to break into houses,
make deliveries, jack cars.

352
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,529
All kinds of crap.

353
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,865
Riverdale's no place for people
that prey on kids.

354
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:59,161
So, let's teach them a lesson. Me and you.
Let's go down there like old times.

355
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,913
I don't think that's such a good idea.

356
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,373
If you get caught,
you might end up behind bars.

357
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,585
You got your brother
and your grandma depending on you now.

358
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,629
I'll talk to FP,

359
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,174
put this Dodger guy on his radar.
We'll let the cops take care of it.

360
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,095
But this place?
This is how we're gonna help Riverdale.

361
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,557
Polly, you have to help us stop Edgar.

362
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,309
There is no stopping Edgar.

363
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,687
You just... have to do what he says.

364
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,942
Governor Dooley isn't letting Charles
or the FBI negotiate with him.

365
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,568
Then just do it yourself.

366
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,695
Just get him what he's asking for.

367
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,239
Or what?

368
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,450
Or he'll start sacrificing his followers,
one by one.

369
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,120
What about Mom? Where is she? Is she okay?

370
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,290
If she's still alive,
it won't be for long.

371
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,002
Unless you do what Edgar says.

372
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,257
I don't think I can get that much, B.

373
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,302
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
is a lot to come up with.

374
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,514
I'm sorry, V.
I know that this is an insane ask,

375
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,726
but I can't say anything more
except that there are lives at stake.

376
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,064
It doesn't need to be cash, does it?

377
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,280
Those Glamourge Eggs
are worth $50,000 each.

378
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,117
-That should do it.
-Oh, my God, V. Really?

379
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,911
-Aren't those your dad's?
-My mom's, actually.

380
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,080
Take them.

381
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,792
But how are you gonna get the other stuff?

382
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,753
I know people.

383
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,590
What do you think?

384
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,092
You need fake passports
for all these people?

385
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,343
They don't need to be fake.

386
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,596
Blank passports are fine.
They'll do everything else.

387
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,765
I really can't get into it,
but it is a matter of life or death.

388
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,517
Okay.

389
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,769
I know a guy.

390
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,563
Thank you, Toni.

391
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,524
[ringing]

392
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,401
Miss Cooper.

393
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,404
-What is the emergency?
-I'm sorry to bother you, Miss Bell,

394
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,073
but I left my calculus book on the bus
this morning.

395
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,119
I'm sorry, dear,
but you'll have to pick it up tomorrow.

396
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,871
Mr. Fritz has already left for the day.

397
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,123
Oh, jeez.

398
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,167
Well, if he's already gone...

399
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,256
[line ringing]

400
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,885
-[Edgar] <i>Yes, Betty.</i>
-I got everything you asked for.

401
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,511
Let me in.

402
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,932
<i>Well done. I'll see you outside.</i>

403
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,391
[line disconnects]

404
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,213
At last, we meet again!

405
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,090
[laughs]

406
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,927
I got everything that you asked for.

407
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,681
Money, passports, food, water.
It's all on the bus.

408
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,809
Now, where's my mom?

409
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,269
[grunts]

410
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,230
I knew you wouldn't fail me.

411
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,067
Oh, Betty.

412
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,485
It is such a shame

413
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,781
that you didn't accept the simple truths
I tried to instill in you.

414
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,574
Edgar, where is my mom?

415
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,036
Because without those truths...

416
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,833
Betty, all you're left with...

417
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,668
[grunts]

418
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,129
is pain.

419
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:43,927
Nighty-night.

420
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,220
[chuckles]

421
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,950
-Will you knock it off?
-Am I distracting you from your genius?

422
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,871
Hey, Forsythe. I was wondering.

423
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,082
Is it common for gangs...

424
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,294
to have a writer among its ranks?

425
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:22,215
I mean, I suppose a kid like you
needed something to call a family.

426
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,886
After all, weren't you
just a little urchin wandering the streets

427
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,097
after your mom ditched you and your
good-for-nothing drunk of a father?

428
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,307
Come to think of it...

429
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:35,103
isn't your little sister
a budding hooligan herself?

430
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:40,150
Only 13 years old and already roped
into your mom's drug business.

431
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,571
You're right.
I wasn't born in rarified air.

432
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,907
I didn't grow up with any silver spoons.

433
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,534
But my dad had the strength

434
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,204
to turn his life around
and become a sheriff.

435
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,917
And I have friends and family
that actually care for me.

436
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,835
Can you even say the same?

437
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,049
So, why don't you try writing
a compelling drama...

438
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:06,968
instead of starting it?

439
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,183
[classical music playing over speakers]

440
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:23,819
Smithers?

441
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,248
Daddy?

442
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,293
You're supposed to be in jail.

443
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,589
<i>Mija,</i> I own that jail.
I come and go as I please.

444
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,594
I heard a nasty little rumor
that you were dropping the Lodge name.

445
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,599
I've never taken the trash out, Daddy...

446
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,394
but I know when something's rotten.

447
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,023
That name is mud. And I'm done with it.

448
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,154
Do you know who Jaime Luna was?

449
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,823
Doesn't ring a bell.

450
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,992
Yeah, well, Luna was my father's name

451
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:16,246
and Jaime Luna was the name
of his only son.

452
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:18,957
Me.

453
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,878
Yeah, I wasn't born Hiram Lodge.

454
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,463
I became him.

455
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,719
You have no idea what it was like
to be a Luna in a town like Riverdale.

456
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,722
Everyone looked down on us
because of that name.

457
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,310
So, I took a name
that people would respect: Lodge.

458
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,771
And when my father found out...

459
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,317
he was angry.

460
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,195
And he beat me.

461
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,949
I didn't understand it because
I didn't want his life, I wanted mine.

462
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,951
My own name. What was the big deal?

463
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:57,871
Well, <i>mija...</i>

464
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,458
it is now...

465
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:07,005
in this very moment
that I understand my father's rage.

466
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:12,886
Do you think that changing your name
is gonna wash away your sins?

467
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,638
It won't.

468
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,101
I'm not going down the same path
as you did, Daddy.

469
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,062
You keep telling yourself that

470
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:25,649
because you'll always be part
of this family. It's in your blood.

471
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,945
And that... doesn't wash out.

472
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,743
Don't bother changing the locks.
You can't keep me out.

473
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,463
Hey, can we talk?

474
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,590
Sure. What's up?

475
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,010
I want you to come back
to Chicago with me.

476
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,597
-Mom.
-You can finish your senior year there.

477
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,183
-You can start again.
-I don't wanna start again.

478
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,353
My best bet at going to college is on
a football scholarship.

479
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,189
Otherwise, how would I even be able
to afford college?

480
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,527
Your father and I started a fund for you
when you were born.

481
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,780
What? A fund? I have money?

482
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:17,158
I was reluctant to tell you
because I thought you'd wanna use it

483
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,160
-on the community center.
-Of course I would.

484
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,497
Archie, as noble an idea as that may be,

485
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,792
do you really think that it's gonna make
a difference here in Riverdale?

486
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,713
I mean, all the crime here,
your friend Munroe's little brother

beaten up by a bunch of thugs?

488
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,509
Is that really the town
that you wanna invest in?

489
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,969
No one is safe here.

490
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,973
Look, I'm not gonna give up on Riverdale
the same way you did.

491
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,435
I moved to Chicago
because I couldn't find a job here.

492
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,687
And don't blame me
if I'm trying to stop my child

493
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,523
from putting his money
into a losing proposition.

494
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,568
Well, I guess that's the difference
between you and me, Mom.

495
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,196
I don't think
Riverdale is a losing proposition.

496
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,656
The same as Dad.

497
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,283
I'm not moving.

498
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,785

Yeah.

Your days of exploiting kids
to do your dirty work ends tonight.

506
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,530
I want you and all your little buddies
out of Riverdale.

00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,411
[man] Exactly.

509
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,373
I'd take a closer look, friend.

510
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,503
You're outnumbered 5-to-1.

511
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,049
I'll take those odds.

512
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,556
Sorry I came by so late, Mrs. Andrews.

513
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,933
No, not at all. But Archie's in bed.

514
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,060
I'm actually here to see you.

515
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,106
That's $40,000.

516
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,860
I'm giving it to you to give to Archie
for the community center.

517
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,320
He's too proud to take it from me.

518
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,408
Veronica, thank you.

519
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,077
But we can't accept this.

520
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,705
We can't be in that kind of debt
to your family.

521
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:13,376
And if you put that money into the center,
it keeps Archie here in Riverdale,

522
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,837
away from college, away from his future.

523
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,215
At the risk of overstepping, Mrs. Andrews,

524
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,843
I'm not investing in a building.

525
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,470
I'm investing in your son.

526
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,805
I believe in Archie,

527
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,601
and he makes me wanna believe in myself.

528
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,686
And I need that right now.

529
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:37,317
Tear the check up if you want,
but I really hope you don't.

530
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,161
[Cheryl] Rise and shine, my dearest.

531
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,997
It's another magnificent day
that's ours for the taking.

532
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,752
Jay-Jay.

533
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,048
Weren't you over there
whilst I read to you at nighttide?

534
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,348
Red?

535
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,439
What the hell happened?

536
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,526
You should see Dodger and the other guys.

537
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,737
They're not gonna be messing
with your brother anytime soon.

538
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,280
You went after them without me.

539
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,533
What happens
if those scumbags look for payback?

540
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,744
They're not going to. I was in disguise.

541
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,164
So, you're a superhero now?

542
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,668
The good news is we got enough money
to buy a second bathroom.

543
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,389
Oh, hell, no.

544
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,143
You know we can't use this, right?
This money is dirty.

545
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,397
Only a fool would spend this cash.
It needs to be cleaned first.

546
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,906
Any chance
your girlfriend could help us with that?

547
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,245
So, we have three votes for Story C,

548
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,249
which makes Story C our winner,
which is penned by...

549
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,043
Donna Sweett.

550
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:26,843
Stories A and B,
written by Bret and Jughead...

551
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,137
tied for last place.

552
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,391
Well, at least you didn't kill each other.

553
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,269
[Alice] <i>Elizabeth?</i>

554
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:37,979
Elizabeth?

555
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:39,480
Elizabeth?

556
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,441
Elizabeth?

557
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,571
-Oh...
-Mom.

558
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,117
-Where are we?
-In one of the motel rooms.

559
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,037
Edgar's been keeping me here
ever since he figured out I was the mole.

560
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,372
I'll kill him.

561
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,209
Honey, I am so sorry.
I was trying to keep you safe.

562
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,463
I didn't want you to know.
I needed to get Polly out.

563
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,839
Do you know what Edgar's plan is?

564
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,300
What?

565
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:11,596
Evelyn is gonna drive the bus full of
Farmies off of a cliff as a distraction,

566
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:12,972
while he...

567
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,976
-What?
-...takes off in his rocket.

568
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,354
-What?
-Yeah.

569
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,398
-He bought a rocket?
-No. He's been building one.

570
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,363
Yeah, because harvesting organs isn't--
Isn't enough.

571
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,865
What is he planning to do with us?

572
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,202
We're gonna be tied
to the front of the bus as shields.

573
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,579
Unless we can figure out
a way out of here.

574
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,961
I think I actually have an idea.
We have to get back-to-back.

575
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,966
Miss Cheryl, Miss Antoinette.

576
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,302
I'll be needing some money
and the skeleton key for the house.

577
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,513
Excuse me? What possibly for?

578
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,974
Thistlehouse has rats in the walls.

579
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,310
-I went into the basement--
-Halt!

580
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,688
You went down to the basement?

581
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,232
Specifically after I ordered you not to?

582
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,819
-You didn't go into the chapel, did you?
-No.

583
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,279
-Miss Cheryl--
-Thistlehouse has never had rats.

584
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:14,033
But, babe, we did hear something
last night, remember?

585
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,123
No. You're right, Tee-Tee.

586
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:26,671
And suddenly,
I am feeling the presence of a rat.

587
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,091
A 6-foot-tall rat with muscles
and bedroom eyes.

588
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,012
Darius, I knew you were a mistake
from the beginning.

589
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,889
So, you're fired.

590
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,018
Toodles!

591
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,197

Ronnie, I hate to ask you this,
but is there anything you can do?

604
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,115
Any way you can clean it
so I can use it for the center?

605
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:41,079
Archie, I know you're trying to do good,
but this... isn't it.

606
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,623
My advice? Burn it.

607
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:44,916
All of it.

608
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,543
-And let me pay for the renovation.
-[scoffs] Ronnie.

609
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:51,422
Archie, please just forget your pride
for a second

610
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,674
and let me be a part of what you're doing.

611
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,594
I need to be a part of what you're doing.

Keep it moving, keep it moving.

613
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,184
Edgar has decreed, it's time to go, okay?

614
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,977
Everybody on the bus. Keep moving.

615
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,564

and they'll do anything you say.

616
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:12,068
Once we drive the Farmies out,
Charles can come in, take down Edgar.

618

He's-- He's fine.
Get him on the bus, okay? Please?

00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,539
Okay. Keep going. Keep going.
Keep moving. All right?

621
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,456
Oh, no.

00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,211
Give me the gun.

00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,548
Get everybody on the bus.
I'm gonna stop Edgar.

Okay.

Mr. Weatherbee.

627
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:45,017
I told Edgar I wasn't the mole,
but he wouldn't listen. And he cut it off.

628
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,480
Miss Cooper, I don't know how I let myself
get embroiled in this madness.

629

Mr. Weatherbee, this is your last shot
at redemption, okay?

630
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,822
Get everybody on this bus.

You've gotta get out of there.

639
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,463
Governor Dooley is sending in

Tell them to stand down.

641
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,510
There is a busload of unarmed civilians,

or I will shoot you in the kneecaps

-and drag your ass out of here myself.
-You betrayed us.

647
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,569
I'm not going anywhere with you.

648
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,827
Do you remember the story
of the prophet Elijah, Alice?

649
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,121
He was seized by a whirlwind...

650
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,542
and lifted up into the sky
in a chariot of fire.

651
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,003
Elijah ascended.

652
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,343

667
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,475
[Munroe] Good job. Cross. Up high.

00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,018
Mom? What's going on?

669
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,688
I was leaving, but what's going on is,

670
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,982
I will be focusing more on pro-bono work

671
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,651
in the foreseeable future
here in Riverdale.

672
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,904
And my first order of business is to get
your community center

673
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,322
declared a 501(c)(3).

674
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,408
That's a nonprofit.

675
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,493
It means that you can ask for donations,

676
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,246
you don't have to pay taxes,
you can apply for grants.

677
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,709
Well, that's amazing.
Except I don't know how to do any of that.

678
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,503
Yeah. You're a lot like your dad
in that way.

679
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:23,092
So, you'll just leave it to me,
and you can go help those kids out there.

680
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,053
Deal. What happened to Chicago?

681
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,222
I'll call the airline
and cancel the flight.

682
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,474
I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.

683
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,146
Hello, Daddy.

684
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:39,191
I'm sure you'll be getting a call
from Mr. Sowerberry soon, but...

685
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:43,321
I just wanted to let you know face-to-face
that I'm no longer a Lodge.

686
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,159
<i>Mija,</i> how many times
must we go through this?

687
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,745
I'm officially changing my name
to Veronica Luna.

688
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,334
And I'm changing the locks
and I'm installing an alarm,

689
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,086
and I'm sleeping
with a Taser under my pillow.

690
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,797
And you better believe I'll use it.

691
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,357
He didn't see you, did he, Jason?

692
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,072
[screams] Get off! Get off of him!

693
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,326
[thud]

694
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,706
We're gonna fix you right up, Jay-Jay.

695
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:42,129
Cheryl, what the hell is going on here?

696
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:43,756
Toni.

697
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,009
You've never met Jason, have you?

698
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,568
-[Jughead] Oh, no.
-[girl] His dad was the Gargoyle King.

699
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,153
[boy] His real name is Moose?

700
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,531
[girl] His girlfriend was murdered
by the Black Hood.

701
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,449
Everybody knows.

702
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,327
So much for a new start.

703
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,038
I'm done here.

704
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,673
[Jughead] <i>He was a broken man, Betty.</i>

705
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,550
And it was Bret, of course.

706
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,803
He did it because he blames me
for not winning the contest.

707
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,264
Or maybe he's just a sociopath.

708
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,100
He knew that he couldn't get to me
directly, so he went after Moose?

709
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,853
This is nothing like fighting
the Ghoulies.

710
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,688
This is psychological warfare.

711
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,314
God, poor Moose.

712
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,191
Just be careful, Jug.

713
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,277
Aww, don't worry about me.

714
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,904
Hey, how's your mom and Polly?

715
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:50,906
[Betty chuckles]

716
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,826
My mom is already working
on her exposé of the Farm.

717
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,746
Polly started this program
at the Shady Grove treatment center.

718
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,874
She's getting the help that she needs.

719
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,711
What about Charles? Is he the real deal?
Can we trust him?

720
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,047
Yeah, I think so.

721
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,803
I'm just happy
that this nightmare is finally over.

722
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,265
[doorbell rings]

723
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,551
Famous last words.
