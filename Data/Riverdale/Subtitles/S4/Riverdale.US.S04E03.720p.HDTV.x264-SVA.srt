1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,824
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,825 --> 00:00:03,060
What were you doing in there?

3
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:04,618
I was... praying.

4
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:07,999
My team's been investigating Edgar
Evernever for quite some time now.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,433
We had someone on the inside,

6
00:00:09,434 --> 00:00:11,435
someone tasked with
getting close to Edgar.

7
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:14,071
My mother is an FBI informant?

8
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:16,974
Charles, what if that
means she's been found out?

9
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,176
You should go to Stonewall Prep, Jug.

10
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:20,645
Look me in the eye and tell me

11
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,180
you don't want to go to a school
that recognizes your talent.

12
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:24,815
Hey, are you Forsythe?

13
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:25,850
Yeah.

14
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,518
Bret Weston Wallis.

15
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,554
Mr. Chipping asked me to
roll out the red carpet.

16
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:31,722
The Lodge name is... tainted.

17
00:00:31,723 --> 00:00:33,758
But my mother's maiden name, Gomez?

18
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:34,892
I think I could work with that.

19
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:36,360
But I did see Edgar,

20
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:37,828
and, Betty, he's armed.

21
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,929
Edgar's digging in.

22
00:00:39,698 --> 00:00:41,031
He's getting ready for war.

23
00:00:45,397 --> 00:00:48,066
Sit your butt down and don't move.

24
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,701
You need to chill out, okay?

25
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:50,734
Nothing happened!

26
00:00:52,237 --> 00:00:54,139
- Everything all right, Munroe?
- Anything but.

27
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,007
Malcolm's been hanging
out at the Wipeout Arcade.

28
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:57,442
So?

29
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:59,711
That place is crawling
with dealers and fiends

30
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:01,512
and I don't want him
getting mixed up in that.

31
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:07,244
Didn't we say we were
gonna turn this place

32
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:08,419
into a community center, Red?

33
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,888
We are. I still plan on it.

34
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:12,356
But...

35
00:01:12,357 --> 00:01:14,124
life kind of threw me a curveball.

36
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,926
But you're right,

37
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:18,962
feels like it's time.

38
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:25,535
Found it.

39
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:32,675
Well, we are certainly not
in Riverdale High anymore.

40
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:35,946
Welcome to the Dead Poets Society.

41
00:01:35,947 --> 00:01:37,514
Not a bad coop, boy.

42
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:44,955
Okay, kitten, let's go
find the vending machine

43
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:46,990
and I'll buy you some Triple Bubble.

44
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:51,328
You still okay with this?

45
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:53,564
Yeah.

46
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:55,799
I'm just gonna miss you,

47
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,301
that's all.

48
00:01:57,302 --> 00:01:59,737
Well, you better take your breaks
from me while you can, Cooper.

49
00:01:59,738 --> 00:02:02,506
'Cause you and I are in
this for the long haul. Okay?

50
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:09,413
I don't know what happened.

51
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:11,181
I thought I wanted to sign the document

52
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:13,883
and officially change my
name to Veronica Gomez,

53
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:14,984
but...

54
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:16,486
in the moment, I just couldn't do it.

55
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:18,888
Look, if it didn't feel
right, it didn't feel right.

56
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,158
I still want to do it.

57
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,793
I just need to figure
out who I'm going to be.

58
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:25,328
And you will.

59
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,130
In the meantime, you want
to go with me to the gym?

60
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:28,231
I'm meeting with Ms. Weiss

61
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,033
about turning the place
into a community center.

62
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:31,034
Of course.

63
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:33,169
Do we need to leave now?

64
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,672
I mean, we've got some time.

65
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:48,451
Jughead?

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,988
Moose.

67
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,255
What the hell?

68
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:55,592
It's good to see you.

69
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,427
Actually, it's, uh...

70
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,594
It's Marmaduke now.

71
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:00,630
Marmaduke?

72
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:02,599
Wait, are you my roommate?

73
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,066
What are you doing here, dude?

74
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,703
After my dad was arrested
for impersonating the...

75
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,006
Gargoyle King,

76
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:11,039
it, uh...

77
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,710
kind of blew up my life...

78
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:15,812
my family... everything.

79
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:19,082
I... kind of had a nervous breakdown.

80
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,383
I even ended up in a facility
for a couple of months.

81
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:23,385
- Aw, man.
- When I got out, we decided

82
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,421
it would be better if
I started someplace new,

83
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:26,589
someplace fresh.

84
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,157
So took a year off

85
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:30,426
and I came here to play
football and start over.

86
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:32,261
Well, are you feeling any better?

87
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:33,596
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I...

88
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:35,898
You know, I feel like a person again.

89
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:39,635
Like this... this darkness is off me.

90
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,772
But, please just keep
this between us, okay?

91
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:44,339
If some of these guys got a whiff...

92
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:47,076
- of who I was...
- No.

93
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:49,578
Your secret is safe with me, Marmaduke.

94
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,047
Thanks, man.

95
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:54,050
And we'll need to be especially
tight-lipped around Bret.

96
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:55,051
You rang?

97
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,854
Forsythe, welcome.

98
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:59,956
- Lovely to see you again.
- Yeah, and you too.

99
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:01,157
I see you've met our roommate.

100
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:02,792
Ah, yeah. Marmaduke and I

101
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:04,227
were actually just getting acquainted.

102
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:06,495
Well, it's about time for seminar.

103
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,829
Did you do the reading?

104
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,067
Munroe and I will group the kids

105
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:13,402
for boxing and MMA lessons
according to their age.

106
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:14,836
We'll keep the gym open until 10:00,

107
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,005
so kids like my brother have
a place to hang after school

108
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,974
and keep them off the
streets before they go home.

109
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,708
Oh, that all sounds wonderful.

110
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,843
I just want you to be aware

111
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,678
of how much work this
will actually entail.

112
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,013
And what about school, Archie?

113
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,815
Mr. Keller will be here during the day.

114
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:28,083
Archie, when was the last time

115
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:29,918
the gym had a safety inspection?

116
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,920
If this really is going
to be a community center,

117
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:33,688
there are updates you'll have to do.

118
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,590
At minimum, adding a second bathroom.

119
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:36,891
Oh, that sounds expensive.

120
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,833
We'll figure it out, Mom.

121
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:40,929
You're just in time.

122
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,431
Thanks to your friend Kevin's Intel,

123
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:46,367
I've had this derelict motel
under 24-hour surveillance.

124
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:48,003
According to city records,

125
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:49,569
it's owned by one of Edgar's followers.

126
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:51,506
And...

127
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:53,207
look who's answering the front door.

128
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:55,739
Great.

129
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,679
If we know they are, then
what are we waiting for?

130
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,080
Have you ever heard of Waco, Betty?

131
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:00,648
Charles?

132
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:02,316
Check this out.

133
00:05:03,123 --> 00:05:04,981
Farm's been getting
pizza deliveries every day

134
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:06,054
about the same time.

135
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,189
We've got an agent in disguise

136
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,856
about to make a delivery as we speak.

137
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:13,956
Yeah? Who are you?

138
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:15,349
Sorry, I got lost.

139
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,065
Pizza delivery. 10 cheese, 10 pepperoni.

140
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:19,600
You're not our guy.

141
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:20,735
Go. Take him!

142
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:23,103
Get him.

143
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:24,372
What was that?

144
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:26,040
Here we go. Come on.

145
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:30,344
Echo, this is Charlie, do you read me?

146
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:32,880
Echo, do you read me?

147
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:34,915
Charles, is that you?

148
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,684
Sending someone in with a wire?

149
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:39,019
You're usually more clever than that.

150
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,420
I know all your secrets.

151
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:43,491
Don't send anyone else in

152
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:46,593
or their blood will
also be on your hands.

153
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:49,429
Wait to hear from me.

154
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:03,542
There goes your Nana Rose again.

155
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:06,013
I swear, it's like every night.

156
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:08,215
It's like she's scratching
inside the walls.

157
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:12,052
Nana Rose is a restless spirit.

158
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:14,855
Babe...

159
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:17,224
it worries me leaving
the twins alone with her

160
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:19,126
while we're at school.

161
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:20,994
Maybe we should hire caretaker for her.

162
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,830
And have a stranger living amongst us,

163
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:25,665
sticking their noses into our business?

164
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,799
Absolutely not.

165
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:29,603
We're all doing just fine.

166
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:49,598
Nana?

167
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:52,392
Nana?

168
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:56,729
Are you okay?

169
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,134
Oh, Penelope.

170
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:02,200
There you are.

171
00:07:02,903 --> 00:07:04,169
Thank heavens...

172
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:08,841
I thought I saw the triplets...

173
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:10,642
burning in the fire.

174
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:15,114
Nana...

175
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:16,115
it's me,

176
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:17,616
Cheryl.

177
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:20,986
And Juniper and Dagwood,

178
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:23,309
the twins,

179
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,811
are sleeping soundly in the nursery.

180

181
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:39,265
I'm looking at around 40 grand

182
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:40,895
to pay for the renovations
that the gym needs.

183
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:42,466
I hate to say it, again,

184
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,626
but I could just lend you the money.

185
00:07:44,627 --> 00:07:47,028
No, Ronnie, I don't want
to take any more handouts.

186
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:48,087
I want to work for it.

187
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:50,280
I just need to figure
out what that work can be.

188
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:51,882
We could host a charity concert.

189
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:53,083
Could have a bake sale?

190
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:55,319
You'd have to sell a lot of cupcakes.

191
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,255
Now, hold on, I think
Bee's onto something.

192
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:00,288
Not a bake sale, per se,

193
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:04,461
but, looking at you
four strapping young men,

194
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:06,195
there is another classic way

195
00:08:06,196 --> 00:08:07,564
to raise money.

196
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:10,065

Great work, Reginald.

200
00:08:16,874 --> 00:08:19,194
every suburban housewife in the county

201
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:21,378
is spreading the word
about our sudsy fundraiser.

202
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,613
What can I say, I have a deep fanbase.

203
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:24,614

213
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:53,708
A little over four.

214
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:55,744
Grand?

215
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:56,745
That's great!

216
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,281
Hundred, Archie.

217
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:00,139
I think I overestimated

218
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,107
the financial pull of your pectorals.

219
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:04,653
Hey,

220
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:06,455
we're just getting started.

221
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:08,478
Maybe we do a Magic Mike night

222
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,879
at La Bonne Nuit.

223
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,928
Or...

224
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:13,495
dare I say...

225
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:15,253
you boys go the full Monty?

226
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,068
We'll figure something out.

227
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:20,069
We always do.

228
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:25,107
Oh, my God, Mom.

229
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:26,409
I was so worried.

230
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,210
No, Betty,

231
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:29,312
it's me.

232
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:30,379
Edgar.

233
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,847
How did you get my mom's phone?

234
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:37,018
I suspected we had a
pretender in our midst.

235
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,453
When I...

236
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:39,987
started cutting people's fingers off,

237
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:41,755
your mother admitted to me it was her.

238
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,278
I have a list of demands.

239
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:47,094
I'm listening.

240
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:50,598
I need $250,000,

241
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,467
passports for all each and every one

242
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,069
of my followers,

243
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,602
food, water,

244
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:57,672
and a bus

245
00:09:57,673 --> 00:09:58,772
for transport.

246
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:00,575
Why did you call me?

247
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:02,210
Why didn't you call Charles?

248
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:04,412
Because I think you'll have
a better chance convincing him

249
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:05,413
than I will.

250
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:09,749
You have five hours.

251
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,863
Charles, I just heard from Edgar.

252
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:25,298
"My mother has asked me to
help her with the turkey,

253
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,968
and I wonder, vaguely,

254
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,970
when she'll die."

255
00:10:30,872 --> 00:10:32,206
Discussion is open.

256
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:34,909
What is everyone's take on Bret's story?

257
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,210
In a word...

258
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:37,878
astonishing.

259
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,914
Yeah, agreed.

260
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:41,048
It's brilliant.

261
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,249
Thank you, Jonathan.

262
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,265
What did you think, roomie?

263
00:10:46,088 --> 00:10:47,354
Yeah, it was good.

264
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,823
It was good?

265
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,491
We've got a real Harold Bloom here.

266
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:51,648
Don't hold back, Jones.

267
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,583
I'm a... I'm a big boy. I can take it.

268
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:58,155
To be honest...

269
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:00,523
it wasn't really my taste.

270
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:02,125
I thought it was, uh...

271
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:03,492
Salinger-derivative.

272
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:08,331
Thank you for that constructive
criticism, Forsythe.

273
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,365
You'd mind if I give you
my thoughts on your story?

274
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:11,834
What was it? The Gremlin King?

275
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:14,170
- The Gargoyle King.
- I thought it was a puerile,

276
00:11:14,171 --> 00:11:17,039
tawdry waste of time.
I mean... it's pulp.

277
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,340
Pulp is not an insult to me.

278
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:20,375
Not to mention, your
prose reads more like

279
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:23,112
a pre-teen journaling
about his abandonment issues

280
00:11:23,113 --> 00:11:24,146
than as a coherent narrative...

281
00:11:24,147 --> 00:11:26,715
Hey, hey, hey, keep it clean, guys.

282
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:27,716
Taste aside,

283
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,651
all good writing does have

284
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:31,052
one thing in common...

285
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,889
Authenticity.

286
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,524
That's my problem, then.

287
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,960
I can't relate to Jughead's work

288
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:40,129
because I'm not from his world.

289
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,432
I don't have any experience
with lowlives, or criminals,

290
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:45,301
- or trailer trash.
- Oh, no?

291
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:47,402
I could give you the crash
course in about five seconds.

292
00:11:47,403 --> 00:11:48,403
Jughead,

293
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:50,639
there is a zero-tolerance
violence policy

294
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,074
at Stonewall Prep.

295
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:53,075
Do you hear me?

296
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:56,811
Nana? Babies? I'm home.

297
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:03,017
And who, pray tell, are you,

298
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:04,219
interloper?

299
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,387
Hello, you must be Cheryl.

300
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:07,922
Hey.

301
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:10,291
Babe, don't get mad, but this is Darius.

302
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:12,594
He's a night nurse I found online.

303
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:14,963
I thought he could help
with Nana and the kids.

304
00:12:14,964 --> 00:12:16,030
Fine.

305
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:17,565
But you will do as you're told,

306
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:19,468
nothing less,

307
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:20,568
nothing more.

308
00:12:22,472 --> 00:12:24,438
You may tend to Nana where she is,

309
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,808
but you are not,

310
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:28,810
repeat, not...

311
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:30,745
to go into the Blossom
Chapel in the basement.

312
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:33,781
It is forbidden.

313
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:36,385
Sacred.

314
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:38,052
Don't sweat it, Dee,

315
00:12:38,053 --> 00:12:39,586
not even I'm allowed to go in there.

316
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,255
Do we understand each other, Darius?

317
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,524
Absolutely, Miss Cheryl.

318
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,768
Dude, there's a tie on the door.

319
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:56,469
I'm... I'm just not
used to this. I'm sorry.

320
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,710
Donna?

321
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:07,548
I'm sorry. Look, I'm
not one for gossip, so...

322
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:08,816
I don't care if you are.

323
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:10,450
I'm not ashamed of anything I do.

324
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:13,620
But, a word of advice, newbie?

325
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:16,155
I'd watch your back around Bret.

326
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:18,492
Why? What is his deal?

327
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:19,626
He's a diplo-brat.

328
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:21,896
Son of a diplomat.

329
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:24,497
Thinks that gives him immunity
to do whatever he wants.

330
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:25,832
Like, beat me up?

331
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,232
That's not how Bret fights.

332
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:30,102
Okay. It's psychological with him.

333
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:32,572
And he's not afraid to play dirty.

334
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:34,673
Okay. I'll take your advice.

335
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:37,677
Bye, Marmaduke.

336
00:13:38,378 --> 00:13:39,411
Catch you later.

337
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:45,452
I'm sorry.

338
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:49,456
Look, I thought you were...

339
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:50,823
I like guys and girls.

340
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:52,491
- Cool?
- Yeah.

341
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:54,426
Totally. I'll...

342
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:56,829
keep an eye on the doorknob.

343
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:01,000
What happened?

344
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:02,268
What did Governor Dooley say?

345
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,636
The same thing that he's been saying.

346
00:14:03,637 --> 00:14:05,271
That we can't give Edgar what he demands

347
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:07,305
and he will not negotiate
with a cult leader.

348
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:10,442
Is he kidding? What about Mom and Polly

349
00:14:10,443 --> 00:14:12,042
and all of the other Farmies?

350
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:17,148
It's Edgar. What do I say?

351
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,717
You need to buy us time.

352
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:20,050
Okay? I'll walk you through it.

353
00:14:21,454 --> 00:14:22,588
Hello?

354
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:23,689
Hello, Betty.

355
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,191
Did you get what I asked for?

356
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:27,893
We're unable to meet any demands

357
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:30,194
unless he releases a hostage
as a sign of goodwill.

358
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:35,000
They want you to release
a hostage first, Edgar,

359
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:36,368
as a sign of good faith.

360
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:37,970
Betty, Betty, Betty...

361
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:39,805
I thought you would
be smarter than this.

362
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:41,473
Working with people who don't share

363
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:44,041
your same interests is a bad idea.

364
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:45,978
At any rate,

365
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:47,846
anticipating that you and your partners

366
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:49,381
wouldn't take my demands seriously,

367
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:51,215
I've already released a hostage.

368
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,017
What?

369
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,351
But...

370
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,419
What the hell is he talking about?

371
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,821
What... What hostage?

372
00:14:56,822 --> 00:14:57,921
Betty?

373
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:00,124
Polly?

374
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,458
No. Stop!

375
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:03,828
Oh, my God!

376
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:07,454
Polly, stay calm. We're
going to figure it out, okay?

377
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,357
- Tell him to stay back.
- Charles, please. Stay back.

378
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:10,391
Please. Please.

379
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:11,892
She's holding a dead man's switch.

380
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:13,761
If she lets go, the bomb explodes.

381
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:14,862
Okay...

382
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:16,231
Uh, all right, Polly,
I know Edgar must have

383
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,232
said something to you, okay?

384
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,633
But it doesn't... It doesn't matter.

385
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:20,067
I know you don't want to do this.

386
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:22,103
I know you don't want
Juniper and Dagwood

387
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:23,638
to grow up without a mom,

388
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,756
or me without a sister, okay?

389
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:27,307
So, we're gonna figure it out, okay?

390
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:28,676
Okay. What are we gonna...

391
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,011
Betty, look at the timer.

392
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,712
There's wires connected to the C4.

393
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:33,080
Three of those are decoys.

394
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:34,148
They'll trigger the detonator.

395
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:35,582
You need to find the one that's linked

396
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,985
- to the firing circuit and the battery.
- And the battery.

397
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:39,820
Can I come up and check, Polly?

398
00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:41,022
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

399
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,189
Um...

400
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,458
The firing circuit and the battery.

401
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,694
Firing circuit, battery.

402
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,327
Uh... it's the yellow...
It's the yellow one.

403
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:49,764
- It's the yellow.
- Here, take these.

404
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:51,565
- So I have to... Okay.
- Yeah.

405
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:52,657
Careful.

406
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:54,858
It's going to be okay. It's
going to be okay. It's fine.

407
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,860
It's going to be okay. Okay?

408
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:01,499
- It's counting down even faster.
- It's a tripwire.

409
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,577
There may be a system override
on the dead man's switch.

410
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:05,845
A pin connected to a chain,
that slides beneath a hole.

411
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:07,181
It goes underneath the trigger.

412
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,216
- Polly, where's the pin?
- Edgar took it.

413
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:10,850
- Took the pin.
- Everybody, get down. Betty!

414
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:13,699
What am I doing? The detonator needs
a pin. Needs a pin. Needs a pin.

415
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,466
- No! No!
- Betty! Come on.

416
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:21,395
Oh...

417
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,162
It worked.

418
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:26,768
It's okay.

419
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:31,790
Scholars, I'm cancelling
this afternoon's seminar.

420
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,246
Instead, we will be
having an evening session.

421
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:39,042
You've each been given a copy
of the same mystery story,

422
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:40,577
with the final chapter omitted,

423
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:42,479
in which the murderer's identity

424
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
would be revealed.

425
00:16:44,748 --> 00:16:47,249
You're each to write your
own version of the ending,

426
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:50,104
in whatever style you choose.

427
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:51,538
We'll then read all the endings,

428
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:53,406
and decide the winner

429
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:54,407
by a vote.

430
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:55,408
Best story wins?

431
00:16:56,077 --> 00:16:57,577
Challenge accepted.

432
00:16:57,578 --> 00:16:58,879
What exactly will this

433
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,648
so-called exercise prove, Mr. Chipping?

434
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:03,416
That there is no single way

435
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,451
to tell a story, Donna.

436
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:08,021
So...

437
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,723
see you back here by 9:00 p.m.

438
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:14,027
Don't be late.

439
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:21,635
Red! We gotta go.

440
00:17:21,636 --> 00:17:23,069
We gotta get these guys, now!

441
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,203
What are you talking about?

442
00:17:24,204 --> 00:17:26,973
Malcolm... got jumped by some thugs

443
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:28,107
for not making deliveries.

444
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:29,575
He wasn't even hanging at the arcade.

445
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:31,144
He listened to me, and
he still got hurt, Red.

446
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:32,145
Is he going to be okay?

447
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:34,147
He's a tough kid.

448
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:35,714
He's seen worse.

449
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:36,816
Malcolm said that the thugs work

450
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:38,284
for some guy named Dodger.

451
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:39,739
He recruits kids from the arcade,

452
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,821
gets them to break into
houses, make deliveries,

453
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:43,256
jack cars... All kinds of crap.

454
00:17:43,257 --> 00:17:45,491
Riverdale's no place for
people that prey on kids,

455
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:46,959
so let's teach them a lesson.

456
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,261
Me and you.

457
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:49,829
Let's go down there, like old times.

458
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,098
I don't think that's such a good idea.

459
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:54,300
If you get caught, you
might end up behind bars.

460
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:56,035
And you got your
brother and your grandma

461
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:57,135
depending on you now.

462
00:17:58,238 --> 00:17:59,638
I'll talk to FP,

463
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:01,593
put this Dodger guy on his radar,

464
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,167
and we'll let the cops take care of it.

465
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:05,011
But this place,

466
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:06,652
this is how we're
going to help Riverdale.

467
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:11,483
Polly, you have to help us stop Edgar.

468
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:13,050
There is no stopping Edgar.

469
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:15,187
You just...

470
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:16,422
have to do what he says.

471
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:18,557
Governor Dooley isn't letting Charles

472
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:20,693
or the FBI negotiate with him.

473
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:22,561
Then just do it yourself.

474
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:24,678
Just get him what he's asking for.

475
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:25,870
Or what?

476
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:29,100
Or he'll start sacrificing
his followers one by one.

477
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:30,369
What about Mom?

478
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,902
Where is she? Is she okay?

479
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:34,171
If she's still alive,

480
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,040
it won't be for long.

481
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,644
Unless you do what Edgar says.

482
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:44,182
I don't think I can get that much, Bee.

483
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:48,086
$250,000 is a lot to come up with.

484
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:49,154
I'm sorry, Vee.

485
00:18:49,155 --> 00:18:51,222
I know that this is an insane ask,

486
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,492
but I can't say anything more

487
00:18:53,493 --> 00:18:55,259
except that there are lives at stake.

488
00:18:57,863 --> 00:18:59,730
It doesn't need to be cash, does it?

489
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:07,003
Those Glamourge eggs,
they're worth $50,000 each.

490
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:09,407
That should do it.

491
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:10,941
Oh, my God, Vee. Really?

492
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,510
Aren't those your dad's?

493
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,710
My mom's, actually.

494
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,380
Take 'em.

495
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:18,215
But...

496
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:19,816
How are you going to
get the other stuff?

497
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,519
I know people.

498
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,523
What do you think?

499
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:27,825
You need fake passports
for all these people?

500
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:28,993
They don't need to be fake.

501
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:30,127
Blank passports are fine.

502
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,896
They'll do everything else.

503
00:19:31,897 --> 00:19:32,997
I really can't get into it,

504
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:34,564
but it's a matter of life or death.

505
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,467
Okay.

506
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:38,335
I know a guy.

507
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:40,337
Thank you, Toni.

508
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:45,475
Ms. Cooper.

509
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,610
What is the emergency?

510
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:48,012
I'm sorry to bother you, Ms. Bell,

511
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:51,181
but I left my calculus book
on the bus this morning.

512
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:52,816
I'm sorry, dear,

513
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,751
but you'll have to pick it up tomorrow.

514
00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:57,221
Mr. Fritz has already left for the day.

515
00:19:57,222 --> 00:19:58,755
Oh, geez.

516
00:19:58,756 --> 00:20:00,723
Well, if he's already gone...

517
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,732
Yes, Betty?

518
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:10,599
I got everything you asked for.

519
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:12,602
Let me in.

520
00:20:12,603 --> 00:20:14,338
Well done.

521
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,439
I'll see you outside.

522
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:47,002
At last, we meet again.

523
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:52,908
I got everything that you asked for.

524
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:56,211
Money, passports, food,
water, it's all in the bus.

525
00:20:58,081 --> 00:20:59,480
Now where's my mom?

526
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:01,349
Mmm...

527
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:03,851
I knew you wouldn't fail me.

528
00:21:05,955 --> 00:21:07,055
Oh...

529
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:09,791
Betty. It is such a shame

530
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:12,060
that you didn't accept the simple truths

531
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:13,395
I tried to instill in you...

532
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:15,567
Edgar. Where is my mom?

533
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:19,003
... because without those truths...

534
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:20,969
Betty,

535
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:23,537
all you're left with...

536
00:21:26,942 --> 00:21:27,942
is pain.

537
00:21:33,716 --> 00:21:35,083
Nighty-night.

538
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,625
Could you knock it off?

539
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:57,593
Sorry, am I distracting
you from your genius?

540
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,731
Hey, Forsythe,

541
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:02,699
I was wondering, is it common

542
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:04,734
for gangs...

543
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:08,005
to have a writer among its ranks?

544
00:22:08,006 --> 00:22:09,406
I mean, I suppose

545
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:11,875
a kid like you needed something

546
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:13,543
to call a family.

547
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:15,278
After all, weren't you
just a little urchin

548
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:17,581
wandering the streets
after your mom ditched you

549
00:22:17,582 --> 00:22:19,683
and your good-for-nothing
drunk of a father?

550
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:20,950
And, come to think of it,

551
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:23,187
isn't your little sister

552
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:25,621
a budding hooligan herself?

553
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:27,790
Only 13 years old,

554
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:30,558
and already roped into
your mom's drug business.

555
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:33,495
You're right.

556
00:22:33,496 --> 00:22:35,297
I wasn't born in rarified air.

557
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:37,198
I didn't grow up with any silver spoons.

558
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:39,168
But my dad

559
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:41,470
had the strength to turn his life around

560
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:43,239
and become a sheriff.

561
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,741
And I have friends,

562
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:47,977
and family that actually care for me.

563
00:22:47,978 --> 00:22:49,444
Can you even say the same?

564
00:22:51,452 --> 00:22:54,720
So why don't you try
writing a compelling drama,

565
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:57,585
instead of starting it?

566
00:23:13,536 --> 00:23:14,669
Smithers?

567
00:23:25,782 --> 00:23:26,782
Daddy?

568
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,086
You're supposed to be in jail.

569
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:34,022
Mija, I own that jail.

570
00:23:34,023 --> 00:23:35,222
I come and go as I please.

571
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:38,160
I heard a nasty little rumor

572
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:40,127
that you were dropping the Lodge name.

573
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:45,032
I've never taken the trash out, Daddy,

574
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:47,868
but I know when something's rotten.

575
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:51,472
That name is mud,

576
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,639
and I'm done with it.

577
00:23:55,711 --> 00:23:57,878
Do you know who Jaime Luna was?

578
00:23:59,348 --> 00:24:00,348
Doesn't ring a bell.

579
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:02,450
Yeah, well, Luna was my father's name,

580
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:03,918
And Jaime Luna

581
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,553
was the name of his only son.

582
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:09,757
Me.

583
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:13,393
I wasn't born Hiram Lodge.

584
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,230
I became him.

585
00:24:17,232 --> 00:24:18,966
You have no idea what it was like

586
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:21,336
to be a Luna in a town like Riverdale.

587
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:24,739
Everyone looked down on
us because of that name.

588
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,040
So, I took a name that
people would respect.

589
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,176
Lodge.

590
00:24:30,688 --> 00:24:32,054
And when my father found out,

591
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,682
he was angry,

592
00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:38,752
and he beat me.

593
00:24:39,888 --> 00:24:41,088
And I didn't understand it,

594
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:43,524
because I didn't want
his life, I wanted mine,

595
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,393
my own name. What was the big deal?

596
00:24:47,463 --> 00:24:48,563
Well, mija,

597
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:51,965
it is now...

598
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:54,802
in this very moment

599
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:57,804
that I understand my father's rage.

600
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,174
Do you think

601
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:03,309
that changing your name is
going to wash away your sins?

602
00:25:04,012 --> 00:25:05,012
It won't.

603
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,717
I'm not going down the
same path as you did, Daddy.

604
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,686
You keep telling yourself that

605
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:14,527
because you will always
be part of this family.

606
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:16,656
It's in your blood.

607
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:17,657
And that...

608
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,226
doesn't wash out.

609
00:25:24,295 --> 00:25:25,761
Don't bother changing the locks.

610
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:27,433
You can't keep me out.

611
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,178
Hey, can we talk?

612
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:41,315
Sure. What's up?

613
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,650
I want you to come
back to Chicago with me.

614
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:46,620
Mom...

615
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:48,155
You can finish your senior year there.

616
00:25:48,156 --> 00:25:49,256
You can start again.

617
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,624
I don't want to start again.

618
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,071
And my best bet at going to college

619
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:53,860
is on a football scholarship.

620
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:56,129
Otherwise, how would I even
be able to afford college?

621
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,676
Your father and I started a
fund for you when you were born.

622
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,002
What?

623
00:26:03,003 --> 00:26:04,304
A fund? I have money?

624
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:05,739
I was reluctant to tell you

625
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,289
because I thought that you would want

626
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,742
to use it on the community center.

627
00:26:08,743 --> 00:26:10,009
Of course I would.

628
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,012
Archie, as noble an idea as that may be,

629
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:14,280
do you really think

630
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,650
that's going to make a
difference here in Riverdale?

631
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:18,652
I mean, all the crime here,

632
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:20,520
your friend Munroe's little brother

633
00:26:20,521 --> 00:26:22,388
beaten up by a bunch of thugs?

634
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:25,258
Is that really the town
that you want to invest in?

635
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:27,126
No one is safe here.

636
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,962
Look. I'm not going to give up

637
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,564
on Riverdale the same way you did.

638
00:26:30,565 --> 00:26:31,832
I moved to Chicago

639
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,733
because I couldn't find a job here.

640
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:36,302
And don't blame me if I
am trying to stop my child

641
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,905
from putting his money
into a losing proposition.

642
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:41,840
Yeah. Well, I guess that's the
difference between you and me, Mom.

643
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:45,709
I don't think Riverdale
is a losing proposition.

644
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:47,245
The same as Dad.

645
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:49,381
I'm not moving.

646
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:51,248
And I will make a difference here.

647
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:48,606
All right, if we're gonna do
this, we got to do it right. Okay?

648
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:50,127
- You guys follow my orders...
- Hey...

649
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:53,778
You Dodger?

650
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,612
That ain't your business.

651
00:27:58,317 --> 00:27:59,317
Yeah.

652
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:03,422
Your days of exploiting kids

653
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:05,424
to do your dirty work ends tonight.

654
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:07,691
I want you and all your little buddies

655
00:28:08,194 --> 00:28:09,293
out of Riverdale.

656
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,829
You and that Louisville Slugger?

657
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:19,002
I'd take a closer look, friend.

658
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:24,007
You're outnumbered 5-to-1.

659
00:28:27,412 --> 00:28:28,478
I'll take those odds.

660
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:35,386
I'm sorry I came by
so late, Mrs. Andrews.

661
00:28:35,387 --> 00:28:37,455
No, not at all, but Archie's in bed.

662
00:28:37,456 --> 00:28:39,489
I'm actually here to see you.

663
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:44,161
That's $40,000.

664
00:28:44,162 --> 00:28:45,228
I'm giving it to you,

665
00:28:45,229 --> 00:28:48,065
to give to Archie for
the community center.

666
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:49,865
He's too proud to take it from me.

667
00:28:51,168 --> 00:28:52,201
Veronica...

668
00:28:53,137 --> 00:28:54,137
thank you.

669
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:56,840
But we can't accept this.

670
00:28:56,841 --> 00:28:59,542
We can't be in that kind
of debt to your family.

671
00:28:59,543 --> 00:29:01,712
And if you put that
money into the center,

672
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:03,847
it keeps Archie here in Riverdale,

673
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:06,482
away from college, away from his future.

674
00:29:07,418 --> 00:29:10,186
At the risk of
overstepping, Mrs. Andrews,

675
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:12,355
I'm not investing in a building,

676
00:29:12,356 --> 00:29:13,990
I'm investing in your son.

677
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:16,793
I believe in Archie,

678
00:29:16,794 --> 00:29:17,995
and...

679
00:29:17,996 --> 00:29:20,396
he makes me want to believe in myself.

680
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:22,232
And I need that right now.

681
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:24,867
Tear the check up if you want.

682
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:27,703
But I really hope you don't.

683
00:29:37,314 --> 00:29:38,714
Rise and shine, my dearest.

684
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:41,350
It's another magnificent day
that's ours for the taking.

685
00:29:45,456 --> 00:29:46,456
Jay-Jay?

686
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:48,958
Weren't you over there

687
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,492
whilst I read to you at nighttide?

688
00:29:58,035 --> 00:29:59,168
Red?

689
00:30:05,876 --> 00:30:07,610
What the hell happened?

690
00:30:07,611 --> 00:30:10,580
You should see
Dodger and the other guys.

691
00:30:10,581 --> 00:30:12,591
They're not going to be
messing with your brother

692
00:30:12,592 --> 00:30:13,616
anytime soon.

693
00:30:13,617 --> 00:30:14,817
You went after them without me?

694
00:30:14,818 --> 00:30:16,152
And what happens if those scumbags

695
00:30:16,153 --> 00:30:17,187
come looking for payback?

696
00:30:17,188 --> 00:30:19,121
They're not going to.

697
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:20,388
I was in disguise.

698
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:24,059
Oh, so you're a superhero now?

699
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,194
Look, the good news is,

700
00:30:25,195 --> 00:30:27,094
we got enough money to
buy a second bathroom.

701
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:40,074
Oh, hell no!

702
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:43,345
You know we can't use this, right?

703
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:44,680
This money is dirty.

704
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:46,112
Only a fool would spend this cash.

705
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:47,547
It needs to be cleaned first.

706
00:30:54,924 --> 00:30:56,957
Any chance your girlfriend
could help us with that?

707
00:30:59,462 --> 00:31:03,031
So, we have three votes for Story C.

708
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:06,000
Which makes makes Story C our winner,

709
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:07,001
which is penned by...

710
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,436
Donna Sweett.

711
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:15,076
Stories A and B,

712
00:31:15,077 --> 00:31:17,477
written by Bret and Jughead,

713
00:31:18,313 --> 00:31:19,780
tied for last place.

714
00:31:21,727 --> 00:31:24,061
Well, at least you
didn't kill each other.

715
00:31:25,654 --> 00:31:26,654
Elizabeth...

716
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:29,090
Elizabeth?

717
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:30,091
Elizabeth?

718
00:31:30,926 --> 00:31:31,926
Elizabeth?

719
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:36,762
Mom.

720
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:40,268
Where are we?

721
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:41,736
In one of the motel rooms.

722
00:31:41,737 --> 00:31:43,042
Edgar's been keeping me here

723
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:44,809
ever since he figured
out I was the mole.

724
00:31:46,008 --> 00:31:47,107
I'll kill him.

725
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:49,343
Honey, I'm so sorry,

726
00:31:49,344 --> 00:31:50,978
I was trying to keep you safe.

727
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:53,847
I didn't want you to know,
and I needed to get Polly out.

728
00:31:53,848 --> 00:31:55,315
Do you know what Edgar's plan is?

729
00:31:57,077 --> 00:31:58,235
What?

730
00:31:58,236 --> 00:32:00,053
Evelyn is going to drive
the bus full of Farmies

731
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:01,954
off of a cliff as a distraction

732
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:03,691
while he...

733
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,226
What?

734
00:32:06,227 --> 00:32:08,396
Takes off in his rocket.

735
00:32:08,397 --> 00:32:10,298
- What?
- Yeah.

736
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:11,399
He bought a rocket?

737
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,999
No, he's been building one.

738
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:19,340
Yeah, because harvesting
organs isn't... isn't enough.

739
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:21,709
What is he planning to do with us?

740
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,179
We're going to be tied to the
front of the bus as shields.

741
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,079
Unless we can figure
out a way out of here.

742
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:32,252
I think I actually have an idea.

743
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:33,585
We have to get back to back.

744
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:38,892
Miss Cheryl, Miss Antoinette,

745
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:40,093
I'll be needing some money

746
00:32:40,094 --> 00:32:41,962
and the skeleton key for the house.

747
00:32:41,963 --> 00:32:43,096
Excuse me?

748
00:32:43,097 --> 00:32:44,258
What possibly for?

749
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:46,626
Thistlehouse has rats in the walls.

750
00:32:48,502 --> 00:32:50,570
- I went into the basement...
- Halt!

751
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:52,206
You went down to the basement,

752
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:55,174
specifically after I ordered you not to?

753
00:32:56,244 --> 00:32:57,945
You didn't go into the chapel, did you?

754
00:32:57,946 --> 00:32:59,079
No, Miss Cheryl...

755
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,747
Thistlehouse has never had rats.

756
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:03,717
But, Babe, we did hear
something last night.

757
00:33:03,718 --> 00:33:04,851
Remember?

758
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:09,323
No,

759
00:33:09,324 --> 00:33:11,023
you're right, Tee-Tee.

760
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:14,126
And suddenly,

761
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:17,096
I am feeling the presence of a rat,

762
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:20,631
a six-foot-tall rat with
muscles and bedroom eyes,

763
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:22,869
Darius,

764
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,635
I knew you were a mistake
from the beginning.

765
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:26,638
So...

766
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:27,639
you're fired.

767
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:30,441
Toodles.

768
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:43,755
All right, ladies. Times up, let's go.

I took it off some lowlife drug dealers.

782
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:22,795
Ronnie, I hate to ask you this,

783
00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:24,230
but is there anything you can do?

784
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,266
Any way you can clean it, so
I can use it for the center?

785
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:27,400
Archie...

786
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:29,068
I know you're trying to do good,

787
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,336
but this...

788
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:31,671
isn't it.

789
00:34:31,672 --> 00:34:32,938
My advice...

790
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:34,006
Burn it.

791
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:35,275
All of it.

792
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:36,976
And let me pay for the renovations.

793
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:38,978
- Ronnie.
- Archie,

794
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:41,614
please just forget
your pride for a second

795
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:44,383
and let me be a part
of what you're doing.

796
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:46,684
I need to be a part
of what you're doing.

797
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:50,722
Keep it moving, keep it moving.

798
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:53,292
Hey, Edgar has decreed
it's time to go. Okay?

799
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:54,725
Everybody on the bus. Keep moving.

800
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:56,930
That's the thing about cults.

801
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:58,866
Speak with enough authority,
and they'll do anything you say.

802
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:00,100
Once we drive the Farmies out,

803
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:01,901
Charles can move in and
take down Edgar. Okay?

804
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:05,571
Traitor.

805
00:35:06,307 --> 00:35:07,673
There is a trait...

806
00:35:08,877 --> 00:35:09,976
He's... he's fine.

807
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:12,078
Get him in the bus, okay? Please. Okay?

808
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,079
Keep... keep going.

809
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,748
Keep going. Keep moving, all right?

810
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:15,815
Oh, no.

811
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:20,521
Give me the gun.

812
00:35:21,823 --> 00:35:22,889
Get everybody on the bus.

813
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,790
- I'm going to stop Edgar.
- Okay.

814
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:27,192
Okay. Keep going, keep going.

815
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:29,762
Mr. Weatherbee?

816
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:32,765
I told Edgar I wasn't the mole,

817
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:34,234
but he wouldn't listen.

818
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:35,802
He cut it off.

819
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:37,670
Ms. Cooper, I don't
know how I let myself

820
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:40,006
get embroiled in this madness.

821
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:41,942
Mr. Weatherbee,

822
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:45,177
this is your last shot
at redemption. Okay?

823
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,348
Get everybody on this bus.

824
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:49,349
Go. Please.

825
00:35:50,117 --> 00:35:51,117
Okay?

826
00:35:51,118 --> 00:35:52,352
On the bus, please.

827
00:35:52,353 --> 00:35:54,587
Everyone get on the bus.

828
00:35:54,588 --> 00:35:55,655
Let's go, everybody.

829
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,159
- Hello?
- Charles, it's me.

830
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,026
I'm inside the motel.

831
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:02,194
Betty, you have got to get out of there.

832
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:03,429
Governor Dooley is sending in

833
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,030
a team of mercenaries right now.

834
00:36:05,031 --> 00:36:06,298
Tell them to stand down.

835
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:08,468
There's a busload of unarmed civilians,

836
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:10,702
including women and
children, headed your way.

837
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,137
Hands up, Edgar.

838
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,174
Sister Alice.

839
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,579
Come with me peacefully, or so help me,

840
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,847
I will shoot you in the kneecaps

841
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:22,782
and drag your ass out of here myself.

842
00:36:22,783 --> 00:36:24,951
You betrayed us.

843
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:26,485
I'm not going anywhere with you.

844
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:33,192
Do you remember the story

845
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,194
of the prophet Elijah, Alice?

846
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:38,230
He was seized by a whirlwind

847
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:42,134
and lifted up into the
sky in a chariot of fire.

848
00:36:42,135 --> 00:36:44,369
Elijah ascended.

849
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:50,574
And I will too.

850
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:00,252
Mom?

851
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,560
Oh, my God, Mom.

852
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:09,927
What happened? Are you okay?

853
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,466
Edgar ascended.

854
00:37:16,762 --> 00:37:19,364
Jab high. Jab high.

855
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:20,565
Jab low.

856
00:37:20,566 --> 00:37:21,732
Jab high.

857
00:37:21,733 --> 00:37:23,208
Jab low.

858
00:37:23,209 --> 00:37:25,210
And cross. Good work.

859
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:26,945
And cross!

860
00:37:26,946 --> 00:37:28,519
And... jab.

861
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,081
And... jab!

862
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,582
And... cross!

863
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:36,894
Need any help?

864
00:37:38,932 --> 00:37:40,533
Mom, what's going on?

865
00:37:40,534 --> 00:37:41,767
I was leaving,

866
00:37:41,768 --> 00:37:44,337
but what's going on
is I will be focusing

867
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:47,172
more on pro bono work in
the foreseeable future,

868
00:37:47,173 --> 00:37:48,741
here in Riverdale.

869
00:37:48,742 --> 00:37:50,142
And my first order of business

870
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,944
is to get your community
center declared a 501.

871
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,947
That's a non-profit.

872
00:37:54,948 --> 00:37:56,982
It means that you can ask for donations,

873
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,217
you don't have to pay taxes,

874
00:37:58,218 --> 00:37:59,417
you can apply for grants.

875
00:38:00,587 --> 00:38:02,221
Well, that's amazing.

876
00:38:02,222 --> 00:38:04,257
Except that I don't know
how to do any of that.

877
00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:05,258
Yeah.

878
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:07,092
You're lot like your dad in that way.

879
00:38:08,295 --> 00:38:10,329
So, you'll just leave it to me,

880
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,564
and you can go help
those kids out there.

881
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,300
Deal.

882
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:15,635
What happened to Chicago?

883
00:38:15,636 --> 00:38:17,970
Um... I'll call the airline
and cancel the flight.

884
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:19,604
I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.

885
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,708
Hello, Daddy.

886
00:38:25,478 --> 00:38:26,711
I'm sure you'll be getting

887
00:38:26,712 --> 00:38:28,246
a call from Mr. Sowerberry soon,

888
00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:31,182
but, I just wanted to
let you know face to face

889
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,117
that I'm no longer a Lodge.

890
00:38:34,587 --> 00:38:35,720
Mija...

891
00:38:35,721 --> 00:38:37,455
How many times must we go through this?

892
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:40,123
I'm officially changing
my name to Veronica Luna.

893
00:38:42,561 --> 00:38:44,663
And I am changing the locks.

894
00:38:44,664 --> 00:38:46,097
And I'm installing an alarm.

895
00:38:46,098 --> 00:38:48,599
And I'm sleeping with
a taser under my pillow.

896
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:51,302
And you better believe I'll use it.

897
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,649
He didn't see you...

898
00:39:07,452 --> 00:39:08,985
did he, Jason?

899
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:15,525
Ahhh! Get off! Get off him!

900
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:25,302
We're gonna fix you right up, Jay-Jay.

901
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,841
Cheryl?

902
00:39:29,842 --> 00:39:31,607
What the hell is going on here?

903
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,643
Toni...

904
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,512
you've never met Jason, have you?

905
00:39:51,162 --> 00:39:52,162
Oh, no.

906
00:39:52,163 --> 00:39:54,064
His dad was the Gargoyle King.

907
00:39:54,065 --> 00:39:55,499
His real name is "Moose".

908
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,468
His girlfriend was
murdered by the Black Hood.

909
00:39:59,103 --> 00:40:00,336
Everybody knows.

910
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:03,005
So much for a new start.

911
00:40:04,476 --> 00:40:05,708
I'm done here.

912
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:11,348
_

913
00:40:13,017 --> 00:40:15,586
He was a broken man, Betty.

914
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:17,187
And it was Bret, of course.

915
00:40:17,188 --> 00:40:21,057
He did it because he blames
me for not winning the contest.

916
00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:22,659
Or maybe he's just a sociopath.

917
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,432
He knew that he couldn't
get to me directly

918
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:25,996
so he went after Moose.

919
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:28,365
This is nothing like
fighting the Ghoulies.

920
00:40:28,366 --> 00:40:30,400
This is psychological warfare.

921
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:31,867
God. Poor Moose.

922
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,104
Just be careful, Jug.

923
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:35,837
Aw, don't worry about me.

924
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:38,507
Hey, how's your mom and Polly?

925
00:40:40,577 --> 00:40:43,412
My Mom was already working
on her expose of the Farm.

926
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:45,448
Polly started this program

927
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:47,350
at the Shady Grove Treatment Center.

928
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:49,551
She's getting the help that she needs.

929
00:40:50,388 --> 00:40:51,521
What about Charles?

930
00:40:51,522 --> 00:40:53,289
Is he the real deal? Can we trust him?

931
00:40:55,426 --> 00:40:56,458
Yeah, I think so.

932
00:40:58,162 --> 00:41:00,830
I'm just happy that this nightmare is...

933
00:41:00,831 --> 00:41:02,398
finally over.

934
00:41:40,437 --> 00:41:42,236
Famous last words.
