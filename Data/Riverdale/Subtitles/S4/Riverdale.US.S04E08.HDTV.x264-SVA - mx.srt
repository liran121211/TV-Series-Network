1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,577
<i>Previously, on</i>
"Riverdale"...

2
00:00:01,629 --> 00:00:03,418
You know what
I think, carrottop?

3
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:06,402
I think you've got
a hero complex.

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,501
Who is Julian?

5
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,792
Julian was to be your triplet.

6
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:13,173
You had absorbed
the third one.

7
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:16,557
The spirit of Julian
is haunting Thistlehouse?

8
00:00:16,644 --> 00:00:18,509
What other explanation
could there possibly be?

9
00:00:18,597 --> 00:00:19,871
Now that
the trials are over,

10
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,361
I think it's time to let
bygones be bygones.

11
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:24,913
Veronica, I have invited
your father back.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,436
I can't believe you.

13
00:00:26,523 --> 00:00:27,742
We were done with him.

14
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:29,160
I wanted to ask you
about Grandpa.

15
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:30,369
Did you know
he was a writer?

16
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:32,478
My old man wasn't a writer.

17
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,761
He was a mean... mean drunk.

18
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:36,191
You two were trying
to cover up

19
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:37,801
something about
Mr. Chipping's suicide.

20
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:38,898
It wasn't murder.

21
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:40,005
You were there, Jones,

22
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:41,434
no one pushed him
out that window.

23
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:42,548
What is this?

24
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:44,416
Six hours of our house.

25
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:45,816
Why would somebody do that?

26
00:00:45,904 --> 00:00:48,316
Film it, and then leave the
evidence on the front doorstep?

27
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:52,150
After a brief hiatus,

28
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:53,931
Riverdale's Watcher
in the 'burbs

29
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:56,902
had released his
much-anticipated follow up.

30
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,254
In the dead of night,

31
00:00:58,342 --> 00:01:00,283
a second round
of voyeuristic videotapes

32
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:02,511
had been left
on doorsteps across town.

33
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,566
Once again, VCRs
were dusted off with dread.

34
00:01:08,564 --> 00:01:10,324
And once again,
they played

35
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:13,486
hours upon hours
of footage

36
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,918
of the viewers' home.

37
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,660
Only this time, the camera
was much, much closer.

38
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:21,300
The implications
were terrifying.

39
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,347
What was next for the Watcher?
Breaking and entering?

40
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,572
And as if those deliveries
weren't unsettling enough,

41
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,934
colleges and universities

42
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:31,496
had started sending out their
first wave of envelopes.

43
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,949
Some thin, some thick.

44
00:01:34,198 --> 00:01:35,996
All life-changing.

45
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:39,123
Making it a particularly
stressful time

46
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:41,386
for Riverdale High seniors.

47
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:44,215
Which is why Principal Honey asked
the school's guidance counselor,

48
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:47,550
Mrs. Burble, to offer
extended office hours.

49
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:50,433
So whatever anxiety
the students were feeling,

50
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,527
they'd have a licensed
professional to go to

51
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:55,332
for confidential comfort
and/or advice.

52
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:58,005
Something, it turned out,

53
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:00,384
many of us
were long overdue for.

54
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:02,750
Hey, Mom. I'm gonna
make some Highpoint.

55
00:02:02,854 --> 00:02:04,052
Do you want any?

56
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:10,323
What's wrong?
Is everything okay?

57
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,949
You were so sweet when
you were little, Elizabeth.

58
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:17,253
So innocent.
When did you become a liar?

59
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,074
What are you talking about?

60
00:02:22,117 --> 00:02:23,945
"Dear, Ms. Elizabeth Cooper,

61
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:27,296
after careful review of your
Early Action application,

62
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:29,385
the Admissions Committee
regrets to inform you

63
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:32,127
that we are unable
to offer you a place

64
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:34,574
at Yale University."

65
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:36,894
I didn't get in?

66
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:39,178
Wait. You opened my mail?

67
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:40,570
I thought to myself,

68
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:42,790
"How could my Betty
get rejected from college?

69
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:44,966
What has her so unfocused

70
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:46,672
that it cost her her future?"

71
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:48,601
- So, I searched your bedroom.
- You did what?

72
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:49,971
And do you know what I found

73
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:52,145
hidden in the false bottom
of your night stand?

74
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:54,953
Oh, my God, Mom!

75
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:56,282
You should be studying.

76
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:57,892
You should be focused.

77
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:59,459
Instead, you are
out of control.

78
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,766
Okay, that's it.
This is the last straw.

79
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:03,245
We are not discussing this.

80
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:04,682
We are not discussing anything.

81
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,509
You and I
are not on speaking terms.

82
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:09,425
You have been invading
my privacy for years.

83
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:10,775
And it's over.

84
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:15,562
Mrs. Burble,
do you have a minute?

85
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:16,660
Mmm... Yes.

86
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:19,228
Ms. Cooper,
come on in, please.

87
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:21,543
Mmm. Skit-Skat?

88
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:23,433
Oh. No, thanks.

89
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:27,324
Um... I have a sweet tooth.

90
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,613
So, how can I be of help?

91
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:33,355
Mom?

92
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:35,919
Oh, we're in the middle
of a session, Mrs. Cooper.

93
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,034
It's Ms. Smith.

94
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:38,498
So you're
stalking me now, too?

95
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,081
Shocking as it
may seem, Betty,

96
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:41,387
I didn't know
that you would be here.

97
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:43,764
I came down
to talk to Mrs. Burble myself.

98
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:45,940
To see if she could give me
any insight on how to...

99
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,376
talk to you.

100
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:49,596
This. This is what's
bothering me.

101
00:03:49,683 --> 00:03:52,785
Her control-complex.
Her insane overreactions.

102
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:53,908
This is my problem.

103
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:55,167
No. What her problem is,

104
00:03:55,254 --> 00:03:56,908
is that she's been
rejected from college,

105
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:58,692
because she's too busy
having sex.

106
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:01,869
Is that what you associate
with sexuality, Ms. Smith?

107
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:03,871
- Shortcomings?
- Excuse me, Ms. Burble,

108
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,741
I must have missed
your doctorate on the wall

109
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,170
because I don't need
a therapist.

110
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:11,052
Licensed psychologist,
actually.

111
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:13,315
What Betty needs
is an intervention

112
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:17,222
for this irresponsible
disregard for her future.

113
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,339
Oh, that's interesting.

114
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:20,017
I was gonna say that
there were months,

115
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:21,671
or actually years,

116
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:24,109
worth of psychotic
parenting to unpack.

117
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:26,807
Oh. - Clearly,
there are a lot of feelings here.

118
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:29,156
Betty,

119
00:04:29,298 --> 00:04:31,813
would it be okay with you
if your mother joined us.

120
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:34,325
Even if I said no,
she would stay anyways.

121
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,119
Betty.

122
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,024
Do you hide things
from your mother?

123
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,879
Well, yeah.

124
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:49,195
Of course.
Everyone does, but...

125
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:51,632
- I mean, I learned from the best.
- Oh.

126
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:53,877
So you feel she keeps
secrets from you, too?

127
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:55,941
Since, literally,
the day I was born.

128
00:04:56,093 --> 00:04:57,967
Only when it's
in her best interest.

129
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:00,263
Oh, oh,
so you joining a cult,

130
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:02,599
that was in my best interest?

131
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:03,735
Not mentioning to me

132
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:05,925
that you weren't actually
brainwashed the whole time,

133
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:07,978
you were just
undercover with the FBI,

134
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:10,067
working with my
long-lost half-brother

135
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:13,024
who I thought was dead,
that was in my best interest?

136
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,051
You're a child.
I was protecting you.

137
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:16,948
Then explain how giving away
my college fund

138
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:18,159
to the Farm
was part of that.

139
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:20,469
That was before, when I was
under the influence of Edgar.

140
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:21,926
How about
when you didn't tell me

141
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:23,381
that I had
the serial killer genes?

142
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:24,627
Or when you had Polly

143
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:26,510
committed to
The Sisters of Quiet Mercy,

144
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:28,800
and didn't tell me
where she was?

145
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,809
Or when you had me dragged off
to that evil-nun-hell-hole?

146
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:34,101
Because she did, Mrs. Burble,

147
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:36,840
where they force-fed me
drugs against my will.

148
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:39,470
But, hey, but, hey.
You know, at least they were Fizzle Rocks,

149
00:05:39,558 --> 00:05:42,465
- and not birth-control because God forbid!
- Context is important here.

150
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:43,832
- Context.
- Did you ever realize that maybe

151
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,155
I started taking birth-control

152
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:47,563
because I didn't wanna
have a baby at 16 like you?

153
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:50,387
Or Polly? I didn't wanna be
like the two of you,

154
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:52,856
pregnant and married
to a murderer,

155
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:54,294
or a cult-leader, or both?

156
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:56,707
I'd hoped I'd raised you
to be smarter than us.

157
00:05:56,795 --> 00:05:58,771
And no offense, Mom,
I am.

158
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,343
Being proactive
is being smart.

159
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:02,842
And you're acting so naive,

160
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,111
like you didn't think
I was having sex.

161
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,065
Jughead and I sleep
in the same bed.

162
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:08,952
She's too young
to have sex.

163
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,747
She doesn't know
what's good for her.

164
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:12,659
You are so hypocritical.

165
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,062
I was fine
taking care of myself

166
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,779
when you abandoned me
for the Farm.

167
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:19,906
Yet you keep
treating me like a child.

168
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:21,404
Oh, so that's a crime now?

169
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:23,388
A mother wanting
to protect her child.

170
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:25,539
You've said that
several times now.

171
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:28,340
Betty's young.
Betty is a child.

172
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:29,872
Why do you think that is?

173
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,051
She is! Uh...

174
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:33,958
Look, it's fine for me.

175
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,700
I take her insults.

176
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,912
That's my cross to bear
as a parent.

177
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:40,089
But the things that
she's written in her diaries...

178
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:41,543
You read her diaries?

179
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:43,564
Yes, because she has
no boundaries.

180
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:45,152
No emotional respect. None.

181
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,694
How does that make you feel?

182
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,683
Like I'm filled
with gunpowder,

183
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:53,464
and I'm one Elizabeth away
from exploding.

184
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:55,528
You need to stop
invading my privacy,

185
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:59,062
and accept the fact
that I'm becoming an adult.

186
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,355
You will always be
my daughter, Elizabeth.

187
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:07,274
And I am so,
so worried about you.

188
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:10,027
- But not for the right reasons, Mom.
- Wha...

189
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:13,373
Forget about college, sex,
and the serial killer genes.

190
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:16,514
Think about everything
that you have done to me.

191
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:20,443
That is what I'm going to be
unpacking for the rest of my life.

192
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:23,525
So you either...

193
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:25,384
start treating me
like I'm an adult,

194
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:27,090
or I will not be in your life.

195
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:30,396
Ms. Smith, Betty's education,

196
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:33,357
her relationship,
her behavior...

197
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,600
I think those things
make you afraid.

198
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:38,490
Afraid that Betty
is growing up.

199
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:41,646
That may even be why you
gave away her college money,

200
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:43,740
because if you can control her,

201
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:48,115
you can hold on to her childhood
just a little bit longer.

202
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:49,928
Does that sound right?

203
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:52,088
It's just...

204
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:56,514
I've already lost two children.

205
00:07:57,823 --> 00:07:59,615
First Charles.

206
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:02,771
Then Polly. And Betty...

207
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,006
growing up,
leaving for college,

208
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,240
moving out, moving on.

209
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:10,889
It just feels like
I'm losing you, too.

210
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:12,443
Mom!

211
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:15,000
That's what happens.

212
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:18,203
Kids grow up and they leave.

213
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,873
I can't be your only... hope.

214
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:25,901
But I love you.

215
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:29,709
I love you, too,
but that is not an apology.

216
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,967
That does not justify

217
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:35,868
the horrible, unhealthy things
that you have done.

218
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:38,168
How you keep suffocating me.

219
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:40,646
And why me? Why are you
doing this to me?

220
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:41,941
Because I love you.

221
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,232
But you love Polly, too.

222
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:47,334
She's in an asylum.
She needs you. She needs help.

223
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:49,113
So why can't you
go do this to her?

224
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:50,943
Because I love you more.

225
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,802
I love you most.

228
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,242
<i>Now, who can tell me...</i>

229
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:22,044
Archie.

230
00:09:22,902 --> 00:09:23,947
Archie.

231
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:25,752
Archie.

232
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:31,674
I'm so sorry, Dr. Phylum.

233
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:33,278
Save it for Mrs. Burble.

234
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:35,441
I'm not interested
in your explanations.

235
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:38,583
I'm really sorry, Ms. Burble.
I've been having...

236
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:40,792
trouble sleeping, lately.

237
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,170
Maybe it's like insomnia.

238
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:43,354
Oh, it's okay, Archie.

239
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,496
I'm not here
to reprimand you.

240
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,354
I just wanna talk.

241
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:48,643
Oh, okay.

242
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:51,589
- What about?
- Well, for starters, college.

243
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:52,831
You haven't applied to any.

244
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:55,534
Yeah, I... I'm not
really interested.

245
00:09:55,622 --> 00:09:57,799
I'm needed here in Riverdale.

246
00:09:57,887 --> 00:09:59,573
To take over
Andrews Construction?

247
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:01,415
No. To clean up the town.

248
00:10:02,547 --> 00:10:03,827
Someone needs to step up.

249
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:04,994
Like my dad would've.

250
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,685
He spent his whole life
helping people.

251
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,778
Can we talk about him
for a second?

252
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:12,700
How are you managing?

253
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:14,917
I try to carry on his legacy.

254
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:16,653
You've already done
so much good.

255
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:20,380
You opened up
a center for at-risk kids.

256
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,177
- That's not enough.
- Why would you think that?

257
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:25,710
Ever since I started
trying to help people,

258
00:10:26,036 --> 00:10:27,637
things have gotten complicated.

259
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:30,823
I-I've messed things up
and I have to fix it,

260
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:32,637
- so no one else gets hurt.
- Hurt?

261
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:34,778
Archie...

262
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:36,912
I have to tell you.

263
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,333
If you admit to a crime,

264
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:43,049
or tell me that you're putting
yourself or anyone else in danger,

265
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:44,456
I'm required to report it.

266
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,992
- I'm fine.
- Are you?

267
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:49,786
Because you've missed a lot of
football, where you excelled.

268
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:54,489
And those cuts and bruises on
your hands are not from sports.

269
00:10:57,601 --> 00:10:59,137
The truth is...

270
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:03,909
I go out at night.

271
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,526
You mean cruising
in Fox Forest?

272
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:07,817
- What? No.
- I don't mean that.

273
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:09,110
I...

274
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:11,468
I put on a mask,

275
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:15,492
and I try to...

276
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:17,818
help people.

277
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:19,033
I'm not sure I follow.

278
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:22,094
I'm a big comic book fan.
Mr. Justice,

279
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,663
the Comet, the Red Circle...

280
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,732
I really identify
with them, you know?

281
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,187
Are you saying...

282
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:30,156
that you're having fantasies...

283
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:33,151
about acting like these
comic book heroes?

284
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:36,265
Exactly. Like there's
this dealer, Dodger,

285
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:39,100
he uses kids to do
his dirty work.

286
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:41,221
Kids. And the police
can't do anything.

287
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,576
So someone else
has to stop him.

288
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:44,249
- Yes.
- To protect the community.

289
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:45,933
- Yes.
- A vigilante.

290
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:48,822
- No.
- Who protects a vigilante?

291
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,851
Who cares?

292
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:51,227
I don't read
a lot of comic books,

293
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:54,197
but doesn't the hero
usually suffer a great tragedy,

294
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:57,299
and then create their persona
out of rage? Is that right?

295
00:11:57,387 --> 00:11:58,188
I guess so.

296
00:11:58,276 --> 00:11:59,861
Doesn't that
resonate with you?

297
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:01,930
Because everything
that you've told me

298
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:05,636
feels like it could be fueled
by grief-induced anger...

299
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,186
Like I said, Ms.
Burble, I just... I'm just trying to help.

300
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:10,902
But to do it safely,
we have to acknowledge

301
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:13,197
- and work on the anger.
- Why?

302
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,783
I know I'm angry, Ms. Burble.
I'm not an idiot.

303
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:19,240
Look at all the crappy things
that have happened to me,

304
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:24,299
to my friends, to my dad.
They make me angry.

305
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:26,300
You...

306
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:29,080
talking to me like I'm a moron,
that makes me angry.

307
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,353
- Understandably.
- And it hurts.

308
00:12:32,695 --> 00:12:35,338
I hurt... all the time.

309
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,205
And all I wanna do
is make sure no one else does.

310
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:42,424
But I've screwed it up.

311
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:47,830
My mom almost got shot
in the drive-by.

312
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,533
She was held at gunpoint
on Thanksgiving.

313
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:53,666
How is a guy supposed to...

314
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:55,643
to clean up the town,

315
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:58,924
and protect his loved ones if he's
putting them in the crosshairs?

316
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:03,560
So what am I supposed to do?

317
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:06,829
Huh?

318
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,453
"Theoretically"?

319
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,508
The behavior
you're discussing

320
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,932
sounds like an addiction.

321
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,393
No, it's not.

322
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:21,689
Isn't it?

323
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:24,205
You're aware
of negative consequences,

324
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:26,049
but you're compelled anyway.

325
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:29,416
That's compulsive behavior.

326
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:32,321
Forget me going out at night.

327
00:13:34,368 --> 00:13:36,170
Just running the center
has made me a target.

328
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:38,136
Yeah, but you keep at it.

329
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,508
It's the appropriate
and smarter way

330
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:44,161
to channel your anger
and help those in need.

331
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:45,848
It feels like it's not enough.

332
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:48,221
Then why not enlist
more volunteers?

333
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:52,492
Like me. Or you can start
an anonymous tip line

334
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,017
to give you farther reach,

335
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:56,172
so those people who are
scared to talk to the police

336
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,975
can report things.

337
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,149
But I can't
stress this enough, Archie.

338
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:03,344
Do not go out at night.

339
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:05,821
You could get hurt.

340
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:08,963
Your loved ones could get hurt.

341
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:10,597
Mom, can we talk?

342
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,655
Oh, boy. What's wrong?

343
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:18,593
I don't wanna give up on my
work at the community center.

344
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,158
Yeah, I know. I've made
my peace with that.

345
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:23,462
Yeah. But I can't keep
putting you in danger.

346
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:25,561
Dodger and his family
are still out there,

347
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:27,382
and sooner or later
they'll come after me.

348
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:28,588
So...

349
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:31,834
I'm moving out.

350
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:33,374
- Archie, no.
- Mom,

351
00:14:33,462 --> 00:14:35,134
you don't have a choice.

352
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,285
I'm 18. I'm an adult.

353
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,248
I'm gonna move into the center,

354
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:42,162
just for a while until
Sheriff Jones catches Dodger

355
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,333
and things cool off
for a bit.

356
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:44,631
Archie, you don't
have to do this.

357
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,702
Yes, I do.
Their war's with me, not with you.

358
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:52,576
It's okay. I'll be okay.

359
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:19,228
You've reached
the Riverdale Hotline.

360
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:22,575
If you wish to report a problem in
your neighborhood, leave a message.

361
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:25,327
Anonymity's your choice.
We're here to help.

362
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:26,866
And remember...

363
00:15:27,323 --> 00:15:28,810
you're not alone.

364
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,705
<i>Cheryl Blossom,</i>

365
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:09,296
<i>please report
to Principal Honey's office.</i>

366
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,960
And the war of the
red roses rages on.

367
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:13,973
Good luck, babe.

368
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:17,755
So, wherefore are we rattling sabers
today, Principal Honey?

369
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,676
Ms. Blossom, do you know how many
absences you've had this semester?

370
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,958
- Twenty-six.
- Need I remind you

371
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:25,051
and the sorry lot of yams
you call educators,

372
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:28,622
that I have suffered
numerous family deaths.

373
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,965
My mother disappeared,

374
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:31,903
I am raising twin toddlers,

375
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,128
and I am the sole
caregiver for my Nana.

376
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,572
Yeah, well, it is for
those reasons that I have

377
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:40,057
decided to put a certified adult in
charge of the cheerleading squad.

378
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:41,897
Pause.

379
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:43,942
You're taking my Vixens
away from me?

380
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:46,653
Hmm. I'll tell you what.

381
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:49,748
I will let Mrs. Burble
interview you

382
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:51,184
and make a recommendation.

383
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,417
But if she deems you
psychologically unfit,

384
00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:55,898
it's over.

385
00:17:02,744 --> 00:17:06,135
So, Cheryl, would you
like a Three Buccaneers?

386
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:08,237
I don't eat nougat,
I don't take bribes,

387
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:11,005
and I don't talk to trade-school
flunkies about my feelings.

388
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:13,968
You know, Cheryl, the only way
you're gonna get what you want,

389
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:16,727
your Vixens back,
is if you talk to me...

390
00:17:17,006 --> 00:17:18,149
about you.

391
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:19,586
Okay, then.

392
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:21,296
I have a rapturous girlfriend,

393
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:24,384
total independence, a 4.0,
and amazing hair.

394
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:26,296
- Are we done?
- Not quite.

395
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:28,642
Did you receive a videotape?

396
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,142
How'd it make you feel?

397
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:32,438
Please.

398
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:35,179
I have felled multiple villains
with my bow over the years.

399
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:37,392
I'm not afraid
of some sad AV pervert

400
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,234
with a camcorder
older than your blazer.

401
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:42,572
Speaking of the last few years,
have you ever spoken

402
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,118
to a professional about
everything you've been through?

403
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:47,984
Your mother's abuse,
your brother's murder,

404
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:49,658
your father's suicide,

405
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,374
your time
in conversion therapy,

406
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:54,978
and an organ harvesting cult,

407
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:57,773
your near-death experience
in Sweetwater River...

408
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,478
That was an accident.

409
00:18:01,553 --> 00:18:03,993
It would be okay
if you told me it wasn't.

410
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:08,653
Cheryl, you've endured
lifetimes of trauma.

411
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,551
I can't imagine going through
a single one, much less all.

412
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:15,658
And as a teenager,
unimaginable.

413
00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:18,340
You are remarkably resilient.

414
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:20,634
It must be exhausting.

415
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:24,540
How've you been coping?

416
00:18:32,616 --> 00:18:34,147
I talk to Jason.

417
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:37,620
I talk to my dead brother.
That's how I cope.

418
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,197
Like prayer.

419
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:40,829
That's a very healthy way

420
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,386
- of dealing with grief.
- No.

421
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,040
I...

422
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:46,349
go into the chapel...

423
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:49,075
in my house...

424
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:53,095
where my brother's
body is, and...

425
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,534
I talk to him.

426
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:01,043
And I think he answers me back.

427
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:06,389
I think...

428
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:08,814
maybe...

429
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,658
I've lost my mind,
and I don't know when it happened.

430
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:15,579
Was it when Jay-Jay died?

431
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,767
Was it when
I fell through the ice?

432
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,486
Have I always been this way...

433
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:24,400
Fractured?

434
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:28,864
In the tomb, when you're
speaking with Jason,

435
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,194
how far away are you?

436
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:32,335
I usually sit across the room.

437
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:33,741
What does it matter?

438
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:35,712
Well, what's the difference
between that

439
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,125
and people visiting a gravesite
to talk to their loved ones?

440
00:19:39,422 --> 00:19:42,268
Or people who have
urns on their mantle?

441
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:44,048
But that ash...

442
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,861
those rotting bodies,

443
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:48,993
they don't talk back.

444
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:50,712
I'm not sure
Jason does either.

445
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:52,721
I think you want him to.

446
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:55,105
But you're not crazy,
Cheryl.

447
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:57,876
You miss your brother.

448
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:01,585
But missing Jason
doesn't explain

449
00:20:01,673 --> 00:20:04,650
the other goings-on in the
phantasmagory that is Thistlehouse.

450
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:06,665
What's happening
in this Thistlehouse?

451
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:09,009
I'm being haunted by a ghost.

452
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:10,956
Ghosts don't exist.

453
00:20:11,094 --> 00:20:13,027
Your life may be
defined by gothic tropes,

454
00:20:13,282 --> 00:20:15,457
but you're being
haunted by grief,

455
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:18,413
by guilt over
your family's misfortune,

456
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:20,630
- your brother's death...
- Brothers.

457
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:23,234
- Plural.
- I'm confused.

458
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,571
Is this a metaphorical brother?

459
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:26,103
No, you mallard.

460
00:20:26,345 --> 00:20:27,749
I had a triplet.

461
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:29,879
Julian, whom I absorbed
in the womb,

462
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,116
and has resurfaced as a doll

463
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:33,163
that's moving around my house
causing mischief.

464
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:35,296
I've thrown him away,
buried him,

465
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:36,434
encircled him in salts,

466
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:38,324
and he keeps coming back.

467
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:41,371
Because he's angry.
He's vengeful.

468
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:42,938
Julian's driving you insane.

469
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,136
Of course, he's a Blossom.

470
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:50,362
So...

471
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:55,889
Do you still maintain
that I'm not mad as a hatter,

472
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:58,548
even though I'm
talking to taxidermy,

473
00:20:58,636 --> 00:21:00,197
and being
tormented by a devil-doll.

474
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:02,642
I don't think you're
being haunted, Cheryl.

475
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:05,079
And I don't think
you've lost your mind.

476
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:10,236
Then what's wrong
with me?

477
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,507
I think someone
is trying to make you think

478
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:16,197
that you've
lost your mind.

479
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,423
I think you're being gaslit.

480
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,078
Like...

481
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,634
- Ingrid Bergman?
- In fact, yes.

482
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:24,936
What sounds
most logical to you?

483
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:27,504
That the evil spirit
of an absorbed fetus

484
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:30,165
is inhabiting
an anthropomorphic doll?

485
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:33,317
Or that a human being

486
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:36,905
is moving that doll around your
house when you're not there?

487
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:38,618
But Julian...

488
00:21:38,907 --> 00:21:41,337
We can find out the truth
about Julian's existence

489
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,662
with a swab of your saliva.

490
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,540
You can't have any of my
bodily fluids, you succubus.

491
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:47,681
It's for a chimerism lab.

492
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:52,155
A test that shows whether a person
absorbed a fetus in the womb

493
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:55,575
by analyzing if they have

494
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:57,814
one set of DNA or two.

495
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:01,111
If I were to guess,
you aren't going to test positive.

496
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:04,822
You mean to tell me this test
has existed this whole time?

497
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,660
Mmm-hmm. I'm going to give you
the number of a doctor I know

498
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,769
who can perform the test.

499
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:13,349
I'll give her a heads up that
she might be expecting you.

500
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:14,726
So...

501
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:17,388
what about my precious Vixens?

502
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,751
Can I keep them?

503
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,970
As a counselor, I think
you've done A-plus work.

504
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:24,959
As an administrator,

505
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,001
Cheryl, I'm sorry.

506
00:22:28,112 --> 00:22:31,572
I'm going to recommend to Principal
Honey that he bring in a coach...

507
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:34,768
to supervise the Vixens

508
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:36,908
while you focus on you,

509
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,346
for a little while.

510
00:23:19,762 --> 00:23:22,641
Mija, can you
come here a minute?

511
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:32,491
What do you want, Daddy?

512
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:34,884
To tell me about
another secret love-child?

513
00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:37,147
No, I need your keen eye.

514
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:39,193
- Is this centered?
- Mmm-hmm.

515
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:42,196
Maravillosa, don't you think?

516
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:43,618
Hmm.

517
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:46,954
The first bottle of Lodge Rum
I ever produced.

518
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:48,898
And second to you

519
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:51,945
and my diploma
from Harvard University,

520
00:23:52,145 --> 00:23:53,288
my proudest achievement.

521
00:23:53,376 --> 00:23:54,462
I'm late for school.

522
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:58,220
Oh, speaking of Cambridge,
didn't you apply to Harvard Early Action?

523
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:00,056
I should be hearing anon.

524
00:24:00,144 --> 00:24:01,440
- Hmm.
- Now, if you'll excuse me,

525
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,478
Microeconomics
waits for no one.

526
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,901
Game Theory's
all about strategy.

527
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:11,710
And, yeah, it's big in Econ,

528
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,767
but it's also been applied to
war... -

529
00:24:15,945 --> 00:24:17,900
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I have to take this.

530
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:25,759
Good afternoon, Dean Kingsley.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

531
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:27,978
Ms. Luna, I know
it's unorthodox,

532
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,337
but as Dean of Admissions,

533
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:31,880
I wanted to give you
a personal heads up.

534
00:24:32,368 --> 00:24:36,665
Congratulations on your acceptance
to Harvard's class of 2024.

535
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:39,016
Yes!

536
00:24:39,975 --> 00:24:41,158
Yes!

537
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:48,268
Thank you so much,
Dean Kingsley.

538
00:24:48,702 --> 00:24:50,111
August can't come soon enough.

539
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,813
Indeed. Now, will you give
my regards to your father,

540
00:24:52,901 --> 00:24:56,033
and please thank him
for the rum he sent.Veritas.

541
00:24:58,002 --> 00:24:59,048
Son of a...

542
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,734
Butter Flinger?

543
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:04,669
I think I know why you're here.

544
00:25:04,822 --> 00:25:07,759
Are there any updates
I need to make to your file?

545
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:10,678
Regarding, say... Harvard?

546
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:12,558
Oh.

547
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:14,876
Uh, yes, actually. I got in.

548
00:25:14,988 --> 00:25:16,517
Congratulations, Veronica.

549
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,680
If I'm not mistaken,
that was your dream school.

550
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,150
It was.

551
00:25:21,214 --> 00:25:22,392
Now it's my nightmare.

552
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,790
Aren't you proud of this
milestone achievement?

553
00:25:24,893 --> 00:25:26,634
No, I didn't achieve Harvard.

554
00:25:26,722 --> 00:25:28,931
Once again, my father
meddled in my affairs,

555
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:31,518
and apparently, bought my way
into their ivy-covered walls,

556
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:34,801
with rum, threats,
money, charm, who knows.

557
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:36,778
It's humiliating
and infuriating.

558
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:39,279
Infuriating because he didn't
think you can do it on your own.

559
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:40,611
No.

560
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,095
Because now, I'll never know
if I could do it on my own.

561
00:25:43,183 --> 00:25:46,619
Is it possible he was
actually trying to just help?

562
00:25:46,707 --> 00:25:49,161
My father has
a bank vault for a heart.

563
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:50,689
He did this to prove he can

564
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:52,492
and always will control me.

565
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,558
And do you feel this control is
him punishing you for something?

566
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:59,822
Was King Lear's ego
gossamer thin? Yes.

567
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,124
This is what he does.

568
00:26:01,212 --> 00:26:02,941
He fake-sold me
two businesses,

569
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,595
and then conned me
into running them.

570
00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:07,091
Successfully, might I add.

571
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:08,439
Then charged me protection.

572
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:11,267
He lured my boyfriend into
crime, and then tried to kill him

573
00:26:11,355 --> 00:26:14,281
in front of a crowd
at an illegal boxing match.

574
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:16,867
He had my mother arrested,
and the piece de resistance,

575
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:19,119
he brought his
secret illegitimate daughter

576
00:26:19,207 --> 00:26:20,967
back to Riverdale
to try and make me jealous.

577
00:26:21,076 --> 00:26:22,994
Well, blow winds
and crack your cheeks,

578
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,267
because Veronica Luna
is no one's Cordelia.

579
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:29,618
Are you jealous...

580
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,110
of your sister?

581
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:32,767
Absolutely not.

582
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,767
She can have him.
They deserve each other.

583
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:36,455
Yet I'm sensing animosity.

584
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,064
"Sensing"? I despise that man.

585
00:26:39,152 --> 00:26:40,603
I want nothing to do with him.

586
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:42,423
But you willingly live at home.

587
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:44,301
Well, yes, but...

588
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:46,455
You obediently come
when he calls you.

589
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:48,815
Veronica, I don't think
this is hate.

590
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:50,439
It's obsession.

591
00:26:50,773 --> 00:26:53,140
You and your father
are obsessed with each other.

592
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:55,658
You're diagnosing me
with Daddy issues?

593
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:57,431
How very Intro-to-Psych.

594
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,955
I'm saying, your connection...

595
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:05,212
goes far beyond that
of a typical father-daughter.

596
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,728
It's primal. Cosmic.

597
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:10,642
He sees you
as an extension of himself,

598
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,142
which is why he'll
never fully let you go.

599
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,121
And you see him
as your ideal future self.

600
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:20,423
No, that's baseless.

601
00:27:20,511 --> 00:27:22,736
I have no desire
to become my father.

602
00:27:22,832 --> 00:27:24,068
You're a straight-A student,

603
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:26,056
you run two
flourishing businesses,

604
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,120
you just got admitted
into Harvard.

605
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:30,345
I mean, maybe
that's your base resentment.

606
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:33,017
He is an abjectly bad person.

607
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:34,767
I have zero respect for him.

608
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:37,423
And yet he has
instilled in you a drive

609
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:39,922
that is perhaps the reason
why you are so successful.

610
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,240
He's taken more
than he's ever given.

611
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,599
My old friend Dr. Freud

612
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:46,887
has two diagnoses

613
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:49,570
that seem pertinent
to your situation.

614
00:27:49,786 --> 00:27:51,588
The Oedipus
and Electra complexes.

615
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,728
I've always seen the drama
in my life as Shakespearean.

616
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:56,537
Not the stuff of Greek tragedy.

617
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,646
But please, enlighten me.

618
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:04,012
You're locked in a constant battle
for identity with your father.

619
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,817
You're driven by
compulsive forces like love,

620
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:10,105
sexuality, obsession.

621
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:12,395
I'm not stabbing
my eyes out for any man.

622
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:14,170
Acknowledging that
the tether exists

623
00:28:14,258 --> 00:28:15,929
is the first step
towards breaking it.

624
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,089
Electra murdered Agamemnon.

625
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,808
What are you saying,
Mrs. Burble?

626
00:28:20,896 --> 00:28:23,035
Obviously, I'm
not suggesting murder.

627
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:26,199
But rather, to cut ties
with him for good.

628
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,263
He's trolling you.

629
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:29,472
So why not ghost him?

630
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,883
No offense,

631
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:34,001
Mrs. Burble,
but your "teen-speak"

632
00:28:34,195 --> 00:28:35,518
could use an update.

633
00:28:35,606 --> 00:28:36,973
As could your advice.

634
00:28:37,097 --> 00:28:38,607
I've tried that repeatedly.

635
00:28:38,695 --> 00:28:41,879
Well, it only works if you
actually want to walk away.

636
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:43,761
Do you?

637
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,222
Yes.

638
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,738
Well, obviously, I think
you should say yes to Harvard.

639
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,226
But moving forward,

640
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,508
I recommend
that no matter what,

641
00:28:54,898 --> 00:28:57,840
you do not engage
with your father on his terms.

642
00:28:57,928 --> 00:28:59,382
You may be his hubris,

643
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:02,574
but he can't be yours,
or else he will be your downfall.

644
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:06,933
I really, really
wanna go to Harvard.

645
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:13,332
You're locked in a dance of
death with your father, Veronica.

646
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:17,504
So my last question is this.

647
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:19,682
Who's leading?

648
00:29:19,903 --> 00:29:22,465
Him or you?

649
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:32,379
You're late.

650
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:33,957
Apparently,
I'm not the only one.

651
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:35,238
Don't we have
a seminar today?

652
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:37,770
I dismissed the others
to continue writing.

653
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:40,140
You haven't even started.

654
00:29:40,228 --> 00:29:42,996
Yeah, okay. I know I was supposed
to turn in pages this week.

655
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:45,644
You were offered
an opportunity here, Mr. Jones.

656
00:29:45,732 --> 00:29:47,621
Frankly, you have
squandered it.

657
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:50,295
I've been told you haven't even
applied to any colleges yet.

658
00:29:50,383 --> 00:29:51,621
Okay, I'm sorry.

659
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,886
My plate's been stacked.

660
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:55,743
I can still apply
for regular admission.

661
00:29:55,831 --> 00:29:57,699
And yet I can't imagine
any teachers here

662
00:29:57,818 --> 00:29:59,489
writing a letter
of recommendation

663
00:29:59,584 --> 00:30:01,343
for such an apathetic student.

664
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:03,649
You might wanna
beg the indulgences

665
00:30:03,737 --> 00:30:05,781
of your teachers
at your public alma mater,

666
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:08,465
vis-a-vis your
future matriculations.

667
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:17,582
How long does it usually
take to get a transcript?

668
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:22,053
I'm sure Ms. Bell is
going as fast as she can.

669
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,584
But while we wait, why don't we
just have a little chat?

670
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:25,980
Uh... no.

671
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:29,690
I have a hard Holden-Caulfield
stance on phony small-talk. Thanks.

672
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:33,306
Do you often use fictional references
to make sense of your situation?

673
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:34,582
Yes. Yes, I do.

674
00:30:35,446 --> 00:30:37,418
I heard about
your teacher, Mr. Chipping.

675
00:30:38,268 --> 00:30:41,449
Public suicide,
that's, uh, tragic.

676
00:30:41,562 --> 00:30:45,129
He didn't kill himself.
He was murdered, by suicide, I guess.

677
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:47,885
- Who knows what they're capable of?
- Who?

678
00:30:48,085 --> 00:30:50,714
Uh, DuPont. And the students.
They convinced him to jump.

679
00:30:50,802 --> 00:30:52,821
Because I'm on the cusp
of bringing down their empire.

680
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:55,448
- Which empire?
- Baxter Brothers.

681
00:30:56,794 --> 00:30:58,205
My grandfather created them.

682
00:30:58,293 --> 00:31:00,269
As in
inspired the characters?

683
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:02,488
No. As in he wrote
the first book.

684
00:31:02,576 --> 00:31:05,527
And then DuPont stole the
franchise out from under him.

685
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,113
Now, he's got us competing
to ghostwrite the next one.

686
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,959
But what's the point?
It's rigged.

687
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,982
He's a thief. And he has a grudge
against anyone with the name Forsythe.

688
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:14,854
Starting with my grandfather,
the first.

689
00:31:16,412 --> 00:31:20,152
Or you have
a persecution complex.

690
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,335
Are you paranoid,
chasing windmills?

691
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,774
So you have a reasonable excuse

692
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:28,402
to neglect your
real work, writing?

693
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:31,019
Oh, is that your advice
after everything I just said?

694
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:33,695
- Just, "Do your homework, kid."
- Well, I'm wondering

695
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:35,492
if the real reason
why you're so focused

696
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,979
on proving that
the Baxter Brothers

697
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:38,563
belongs to your family

698
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:40,223
is because you're afraid.

699
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:42,592
Are you insecure about
your own talent as a writer?

700
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,576
I'm not gonna be psychoanalyzed

701
00:31:44,664 --> 00:31:46,364
by someone who doesn't know the
phrase "tilting at windmills."

702
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:47,715
It's about recognition.

703
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:51,449
It's about not letting some ascot
steal my family's achievements.

704
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:53,297
You know, my grandfather
could've been Gatsby-rich.

705
00:31:53,384 --> 00:31:54,881
You know what he was instead?

706
00:31:55,134 --> 00:31:58,067
He was a mean drunk who
beat my father in a trailer.

707
00:31:58,155 --> 00:31:59,798
But from what
you're describing,

708
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:01,132
this investigation

709
00:32:01,332 --> 00:32:04,074
is trying to get those
very things you claim to hate.

710
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:07,433
An inheritance,
status, prestige.

711
00:32:07,554 --> 00:32:08,841
I'm not trying to be like them.

712
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,746
No, clearly.
Better not to try at all.

713
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:14,793
Fulfil their expectation
that you're a bum,

714
00:32:14,882 --> 00:32:16,822
then claim that they
didn't give you a chance.

715
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,660
That is the easy path.

716
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:21,605
Now, your father,
on the other hand,

717
00:32:21,693 --> 00:32:22,965
he took a harder one.

718
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:26,488
Good. The designated
dad-part of this lecture.

719
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:27,986
He's a Sheriff now.

720
00:32:28,095 --> 00:32:29,897
Came from a poor household

721
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,600
with an abusive father,
and did the work to transform himself.

722
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:37,699
And sacrificed,
so you could succeed.

723
00:32:38,418 --> 00:32:41,308
I bet he was very supportive
of you going to Stonewall Prep.

724
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:44,088
Yeah, practically
dragged me there.

725
00:32:44,176 --> 00:32:46,814
And you repay him by
going on this quest to prove

726
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:48,996
that the man that caused him
immeasurable pain

727
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:50,842
is some kind of wronged hero.

728
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,288
How do you think
that makes him feel?

729
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:58,607
Maybe instead
of lionizing your grandfather,

730
00:33:00,705 --> 00:33:04,355
you should try seeing him
through your father's eyes.

731
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,247
I won't think
you less smart if...

732
00:33:10,374 --> 00:33:12,339
you admit that I'm right.

733
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,656
You're right.

734
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,472
My poor dad.

735
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:26,972
I'm so selfish.

736
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:28,527
No.

737
00:33:28,645 --> 00:33:31,394
You're just a high school
senior from Riverdale.

738
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:34,004
You're busy.

739
00:33:37,654 --> 00:33:39,358
Maybe I should...

740
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:44,633
put down the conspiracy theories
and just do my homework.

741
00:33:47,312 --> 00:33:48,683
You're underpaid, aren't you?

742
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:50,168
And overqualified.

743
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,636
Which means I don't expect anyone
to change habits overnight.

744
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:56,996
If you're going
to see this mystery

745
00:33:57,084 --> 00:33:59,277
about the Baxter Brothers'
authorship through,

746
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:03,413
then don't fall back on
conjecture or righteous anger.

747
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,722
Do the work.
You know,

748
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:07,316
investigate.

749
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:13,808
Now let's see
where those transcripts are.

750
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:17,972
Oh, and just... take the rest of it.
You're my last one today.

751
00:34:25,308 --> 00:34:28,511
Hey, boy. I've missed
seeing you around the house,

752
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:30,636
typing away on that thing...

753
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:35,276
Whoa... what's all this?

754
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:41,035
I love you. And I appreciate everything
that you've done for me. I...

755
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:43,277
I don't think
I say that enough.

756
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:07,955
Elizabeth, perfect timing.
The boys are out back,

757
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:10,400
and the casserole's
almost ready. Set the table?

758
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:16,939
Why are you looking at me like that?
Come on. Chip chop.

759
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,222
I love you most, too, Mom.

760
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,877
Hi, um, my name is...
I don't wanna say.

761
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:25,254
But I live in the apartment building
at the north end of Sketch Alley,

762
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,728
and the man who lives down the
hall, I think he hits my mom.

763
00:36:28,816 --> 00:36:29,868
And I...

764
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:31,480
I think she needs help.

765
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:33,371
Please, I need help.

766
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:57,138
T.T., I got my results.

767
00:36:57,226 --> 00:36:59,873
From Highsmith College?
I thought you were already accepted.

768
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:02,902
No, silly lovebug.
My chimerism test results.

769
00:37:03,243 --> 00:37:06,078
Promise me, no matter what the contents
of this envelope, you're here for me.

770
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:07,908
Cheryl, I have no idea
what you're talking about,

771
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:10,594
but I love you,
and nothing would ever change that.

772
00:37:24,502 --> 00:37:26,483
Negative. Negative!

773
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:29,500
T.T., I'm 100%
Cheryl Marjorie Blossom.

774
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:32,826
Babe, I love seeing you this
happy, but what does that mean?

775
00:37:32,914 --> 00:37:35,250
It means that Burble was right.

776
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:38,334
Fact. I'm not crazy.
I'm not haunted.

777
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,937
Maybe there once was a Julian
in my mother's mortal womb,

778
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,792
but I didn't absorb him.

779
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,334
That's amazing.

780
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:47,884
But how do we explain the
weirdness around Thistlehouse?

781
00:37:47,972 --> 00:37:50,140
Mrs. B enlightened me
to the realization

782
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:53,030
that most likely someone
is trying to drive me mad.

783
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:55,849
But once I find out
who this depraved monster is,

784
00:37:55,937 --> 00:37:58,199
I will unleash a wrath
upon them so wicked,

785
00:37:58,287 --> 00:38:01,385
they will wish they had been
consumed in their mother's womb.

786
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,141
Veronica!

787
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,817
What's the matter, Daddy?

788
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:10,044
Why did I get a call
from Dean Kingsley

789
00:38:10,132 --> 00:38:13,438
informing me that you turned
down your acceptance to Harvard?

790
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:15,616
Please tell me
he's sorely mistaken.

791
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:16,873
There has been no mistake.

792
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,498
I won't be a crimson come fall.

793
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:21,475
Besides, I look better
in Yale blue, anyway.

794
00:38:21,563 --> 00:38:24,059
Oh! Are you insane?

795
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:26,829
No one rejects Harvard.

796
00:38:27,627 --> 00:38:29,559
- It was your dream.
- One of my dreams.

797
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:32,522
Yes. But then you
ruined it for me.

798
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,515
Walking through
those ivory towers,

799
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:38,280
I'd be letting you dictate
the rest of my life.

800
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:41,130
I'd graduate,
get my MBA from Oxford,

801
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,547
run a Fortune 500,
make the cover of Fibes, obviously.

802
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:48,224
The next 20 years
would be mapped out by you.

803
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:51,662
I'm finished living
your version of my life.

804
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,829
You don't get to own my future.

805
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:56,884
So consider
the ties that bind... cut.

806
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:02,070
Really? And what do you think
you'll do now, mija?

807
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:04,024
Walk away from me?

808
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:06,961
You've never
been able to do that.

809
00:39:08,488 --> 00:39:11,030
You're right.
It would appear we're locked

810
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:13,459
in a twisted Greek tragedy.

811
00:39:13,547 --> 00:39:15,773
But my guidance counselor
told me...

812
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:18,201
that there is
one way to end this.

813
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:22,008
I have to kill you.

814
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:26,766
Don't worry. I wouldn't stoop
to your level to murder. No.

815
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:31,083
I'm going to kill you on the battlefield
you cherish above all others.

816
00:39:31,633 --> 00:39:32,915
Business.

817
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:37,026
I'm going to take you on
head-to-head, and destroy you.

818
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:39,786
Just like Oedipus and Electra
did to their daddies.

819
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,413
And when I'm done,

820
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:44,618
I will bury your battered
and beaten carcass

821
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:46,352
and be free of you...

822
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:48,586
once and for all.

823
00:39:54,507 --> 00:39:56,179
This bottle I cracked open

824
00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:00,068
is a lot better than the swill
you've been making recently, Daddy.

825
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:01,883
But my rum...

826
00:40:02,224 --> 00:40:04,743
will be far superior.

827
00:40:28,997 --> 00:40:30,973
These are really great, Jug.

828
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,702
You really captured the essence
of the Baxter Brothers,

829
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,288
but you made it your own.

830
00:40:35,384 --> 00:40:37,057
And I caught up on
all my college applications.

831
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,524
So wait, I wanna
show you something.

832
00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:41,821
This...

833
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:44,977
An article I found from 2002.

834
00:40:45,689 --> 00:40:48,666
"Novelist Theodore Weisel
drowns in yachting accident."

835
00:40:48,874 --> 00:40:50,375
Why does that name
sound familiar?

836
00:40:50,463 --> 00:40:53,116
He was in the Quill and Skull
literary society with my grandfather.

837
00:40:53,204 --> 00:40:54,632
I tracked down
all the original members.

838
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,049
Yeah, of course,
they could tell you something

839
00:40:56,136 --> 00:40:58,482
about what your grandad
and DuPont were like back then.

840
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:02,258
But guess what? Theodore's not the
only one who suffers an accident.

841
00:41:02,652 --> 00:41:05,847
This one is from 1978.

842
00:41:05,953 --> 00:41:07,235
Drove off a bridge.

843
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:10,610
This one's from 1994.
Mechanical failure.

844
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,226
In fact, DuPont
and my MIA grandfather

845
00:41:13,314 --> 00:41:15,343
are the only ones of the
society who are not dead.

846
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:19,183
Which begs the question, are these
all horrible, suspicious accidents...

847
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:20,714
Or murders?

848
00:41:21,215 --> 00:41:24,533
Jug, if you're right,
you need to transfer.

849
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:27,017
I can't.
We're so close to this.

850
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:28,428
- I can feel it.
- Yeah.

851
00:41:28,802 --> 00:41:30,637
That's what I'm afraid of.

852
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,774
Are you sure these are the three
suspects you saw that night?

853
00:41:38,587 --> 00:41:39,830
It's definitely them.

854
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,822
Those are the kids
we saw kill Jughead.

855
