[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,721
[Hiram] I am excited to fulfill
a lifelong dream of mine

3
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,514
and announce my candidacy for mayor.

4
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,641
Our father needed help.

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,309
"Our father"?

6
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,812
Thanks for meeting with me, Mr. DuPont.
I wanted to talk to you

7
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,981
about the first book
in the Baxter Brothers series.

8
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,191
-You didn't write it.
-You're very lucky...

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,820
I don't take you to the headmaster
and get you expelled.

10
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,239
-Are you okay?
-[Chipping] I'm sorry, Jughead...

11
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,241
that I couldn't help you.

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,327
I will be taking over
Mr. Chipping's seminar.

13
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,247
[Cheryl] Aunt Cricket? Uncle Bedford?

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,498
-Cheryl.
-Uncle Bedford.

15
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,461
You are going away
for a long, long time, Cheryl.

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,131
[Toni] Let go of her, you monster! [yells]

17
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,844
-You wanna fight me again?
-Don't you need to put your mask on first?

18
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,680
We gotta get him to a hospital.

19
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,392
[Jughead] <i>Thanksgiving.</i>

20
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,313
<i>The time of year when friends</i>
<i>and family gather to eat turkey,</i>

21
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,192
<i>watch the big game and give thanks</i>
<i>for all that they have.</i>

22
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,033
<i>But for Archie,</i>
<i>this year was all about what he'd lost.</i>

23
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,786
<i>It was the first Thanksgiving</i>
<i>without his father.</i>

24
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,163
<i>And the void that Fred Andrews left</i>

25
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,707
<i>was as cold as the winds blowing</i>
<i>through the town.</i>

26
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,253
<i>And while Archie was thinking of ways</i>
<i>to give back,</i>

27
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,173
<i>Riverdale's new mayor was grabbing</i>
<i>all that he could.</i>

28
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,926
<i>Hiram Lodge had run unopposed,</i>

29
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,262
<i>allowing him to ascend to power</i>
<i>virtually overnight.</i>

30
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,517
<i>Meanwhile, across town,</i>
<i>at Riverdale General Hospital,</i>

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,852
<i>a different family gathering</i>
<i>was taking place.</i>

32
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,562
<i>For the Dickenson crime clan,</i>

33
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,981
<i>the only dish on the Thanksgiving menu</i>
<i>was revenge.</i>

34
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,275
Now that our boy Dodger is stable...

35
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,195
we'll find whoever did this to him.

36
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,240
Guy from the community center. Gotta be.

37
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,617
What community center?

38
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,203
Who the hell are you talking about?

39
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,373
[Jughead] <i>Weather forecasters were calling</i>
<i>for an epic ice storm,</i>

40
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,583
<i>and you could literally feel</i>
<i>the temperature dropping.</i>

41
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,501
<i>Mija.</i>

42
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,796
Hey. You were missed this morning.

43
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,591
Oh, wait, was your inauguration today?

44
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,846
Well, you can make it up to me
tomorrow night.

45
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,557
I made reservations
at the Sweetwater Country Club.

46
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,934
I'm helping Archie
at the community center.

47
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,769
Yeah, Archie's community center.

48
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,231
Wasn't a man found bleeding out,

49
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,191
on the verge of death,
right in front of it?

50
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,279
Just terrible what's going on
in that part of town.

51
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,197
It's a real problem.

52
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:43,621
Well, you make sure you wish Archie
a very happy Thanksgiving for me.

53
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,043
All right, everyone. Bring it in! Come on.

54
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,920
Hustle up, hustle up.

55
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,758
All right, look.

56
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,554
We know some of you guys have nowhere
to go for Thanksgiving,

57
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,973
so Munroe and I are gonna keep
the center open tomorrow.

58
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,893
We're gonna have hot meals
with all the fixings!

59
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,603
[all cheer]

60
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,689
-Seriously? You guys are cooking?
-Hell, yeah.

61
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,149
-And my mom.
-And grandma.

62
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,276
So, tell your friends
there's an open door policy.

63
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,194
-Everyone is invited.
-All right.

64
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,367
And with that, the seminar is adjourned
for the remainder of the week.

65
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,914
I hope you all have a restful
and productive Thanksgiving break.

66
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,709
Mr. DuPont, before you go,
I was wondering...

67
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,796
I was wondering
if you had any more information

68
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,840
about why Mr. Chipping killed himself.

69
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,427
Alcoholism. Drove him to the edge.

70
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,596
Rupert had many demons, I'm afraid.

71
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,389
Well, he didn't leave a note.

72
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,059
-Hasn't been much of an investigation.
-At the family's request.

73
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,312
And it was clearly a suicide.
You saw it with your own eyes.

74
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,608
Mr. Chipping didn't come to you
to talk about me, did he?

75
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,735
No, why would he have?

76
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,821
-Well, because I shared with him--
-That ridiculous notion...

77
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,660
of your grandfather writing
the original Baxter Brothers novel?

78
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,286
He never brought it up.

79
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,498
And might I make a suggestion, Mr. Jones?

80
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,168
That you forget about this delusion
over the Thanksgiving break.

81
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,047
Now, if you'll excuse me...

82
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,552
[Jughead] <i>You still gonna make it?</i>

83
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,472
Even with this biblical ice storm
that they're predicting?

84
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,975
Jug, I don't care what my mom
or the weatherman are saying.

85
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,894
There's zero chance
that I'm not seeing you this weekend.

86
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,854
[on speaker] <i>Then, hurry up</i>
<i>and get here already.</i>

87
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,148
-I need your help with something.
<i>-Oh...</i>

88
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,734
You mean writing
your Baxter Brothers sample?

89
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,362
<i>Well, I am on a deadline,</i>
<i>and that's the reason I'm hunkering down,</i>

90
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,157
but also considering you and I are going
to be the only ones on campus,

91
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,285
I figured it would be the perfect time

92
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,288
to do a little sleuthing
into Chipping's death.

93
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,040
Because, believe me,
no one else is doing it.

94
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,920
Hmm. Conspiracy theories
and a murder mystery to solve?

95
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,423
Sounds like a romantic getaway to me.

96
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,384
All right. I love you. See you later.

97
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,933
[Cheryl] Did you hear the good news,
Tee-Tee?

98
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,396
There's a Category 4 ice storm headed
towards Riverdale like the wrath of God.

99
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,648
How is that good news, Cheryl?

100
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:20,862
Well, whilst the rest of Riverdale
sits down to give thanks,

101
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,740
we'll be dumping Bedford's body
in Sweetwater River,

102
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,575
just before it freezes over.

103
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,412
By the time spring thaw comes around,
the salmon will have gobbled up his eyes.

104
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,000
Toni...

105
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,502
What is it, my sweet?

106
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,131
I feel like somebody's watching me
all the time.

107
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:45,094
Whatever guilt you're experiencing,
free yourself of it.

108
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,599
You didn't set out to do anyone any harm.

109
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,059
Remember?

110
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,145
You were defending me,
and I love you for it.

111
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:02,695
Feast your eyes on this, boys,
a true Thanksgiving cornucopia.

112
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,991
Wha--? Ronnie, how...?
Where did you get all of this?

113
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,202
I put in a to-go order
at the country club.

114
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,745
Daddy gave me the idea.

115
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,582
I figured this could supplement whatever
you and yours are cooking for the kids.

116
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:20,713
Red, tell me this doesn't mean
you are deep-frying a Thanksgiving turkey.

117
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,340
Yes, I am.

118
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,383
It's tradition.
My dad would do one every year.

119
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,594
Best damn turkey I ever tasted.

120
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,013
You should come by tomorrow, Mr. Jones.

121
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,933
Actually, Archie,
that's what we need to talk about.

122
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,144
I hate to do this, but I'm under orders.

123
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,063
To shut you down.

124
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,524
What? Orders from who?

125
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,110
Let me guess, the mayor?

126
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,530
You've got to be kidding me.
He can't do this.

127
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,491
Yeah, he can.
He's mayor now, he can do anything.

128
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,702
And technically, the attack on Dodger's
an open investigation,

129
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,746
so this is still an active crime scene.

130
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,623
Plus, Hiram said
with the ice storm coming--

131
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:59,293
He's doing this to punish me,
to get me to spend the holiday with him.

132
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,129
-Can't we push back?
-I did.

133
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,297
For a couple of hours.

134
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,261
Look...

135
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:13,057
I'm not supposed to say this, but I know
what I would do if I was in your place.

136
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,226
Screw him.

137
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,894
{\an8}Yeah.

138
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,773
{\an8}I'm sorry, but Hiram Lodge is
not canceling Thanksgiving.

139
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,316
Good man.

140
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,902
You're doing your dad proud.

141
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,920
{\an8}Hey, stranger.

142
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,090
{\an8}Hey. Wow, that was fast.

143
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,676
{\an8}I took an earlier train to beat the storm.

144
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,598
{\an8}Jug, hit save.

145
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,143
{\an8}I know. I'm sorry.
I'm almost done with my first chapter.

146
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,688
{\an8}Yeah, and I can't wait to read it
and to help you sleuth.

147
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,941
{\an8}But right now,
we have some catching up to do.

148
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,610
{\an8}-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

149
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,571
{\an8}<i>♪ Feel the heat under the tide ♪</i>

{\an8}Hiram.

152

{\an8}I can't believe I'm working for him again.
Still doing his damn dirty work.

You could quit.

But you know what I'm not gonna do?

-Hm.

Mm-hm.

00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,635
{\an8}Well, the club was closed
because of the storm,

168
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,886

177
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,956
{\an8}Are you referring to my decision
to close Archie's shelter?

178
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,084
It was a matter of public safety, <i>mija.</i>
It's nothing personal.

179
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,887
Neither was that, <i>Papi.</i>

[Mary] <i>Yeah. It's Thanksgiving.</i>

182
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,106
I know the difference between the letter
of the law and doing what's right,

183
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,150
and feeding those kids is what's right.

184
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,487
Anyway, Hiram's not gonna have
guards stationed outside the door.

185
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,239
Honestly, I'm more worried
about the storm.

186
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:19,368
Well, I'll put chains on the truck tires
and salt the sidewalk around the center.

-It's not right.
-No.

But, hey, we'll get through this.

-Pray tell.
-I just ran into your Aunt Cricket.

196
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,819
She's parked down the road, spying on us.

197
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,738
That's the reason
why I've been feeling watched.

198

Did you interact
with that nosy, old turkey waddle?

199

Babe, how are we gonna get rid
of your Uncle Bedford's body,

200
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,578
now that she's staking us out?

201
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,042
We need to scare dear Cricket off,
once and for all,

202
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,462
and disabuse her of the idea
that she will ever get

203
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,340
even a sliver of our maple empire...

204
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,136
by...

205
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,935
inviting her to celebrate a traditional
Blossom Thanksgiving with us.

206
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,522
One honoring my gothic, ghoulish roots.

207
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,315
I'm afraid to ask.

Toni...

209
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,779
there's a family legend
Nana Rose shared with me

210
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,323
on one of her more lucid days

211
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:44,495
that will be the centerpiece of
a carefully planned performance art piece.

212
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,332
A tale so gruesome,
it will turn Aunt Cricket's hair white

213
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,961
and send her fleeing into the night,
never to be heard from again.

214
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,174
I missed you.

215
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,552
I missed you, too.

216
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,849
I was thinking
about Mr. Chipping again earlier.

217
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,979
How he died just after he went to talk
to DuPont about my grandpa.

218
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:16,444
I think Mr. DuPont threatened
or blackmailed him into killing himself.

219
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:23,617
Wow, that's an extreme theory, Jug.
What's the motive?

220
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,830
Well, the Baxter Brothers franchise
is worth something like $200 million.

221
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,459
That's a compelling motive for Mr. DuPont
not to want his fraud exposed.

222
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,211
Yeah, but what leverage
did DuPont have over Chipping

223
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,005
to make him kill himself?

224
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,423
This is where it gets interesting.

225
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,218
How do you get someone to do
something they don't wanna do?

226
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,595
Blackmail, right?

227
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:50,311
Look... at these yearbook photos
I printed out of Mr. DuPont and Chipping.

228
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,604
These are decades apart.

229
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,481
You notice anything?

230
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,027
-Is that the same tie pin?
-Yes.

231
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:03,532
Apparently, that is the mark
of Quill and Skull.

232
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,660
It's one of Stonewall's
oldest secret societies.

233
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,079
And like so many secret societies,

234
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,956
what if their initiation has
something to do

235
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,375
with you revealing your deepest
and darkest secrets?

236
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,921
Well, then, DuPont may have used
Chipping's blackmail material

237
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,589
to coerce him into suicide.

238
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,508
That's exactly what I was thinking.

239
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,844
And maybe some of my current classmates
are part of the same society.

240
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,555
I mean, I checked Bret's side of the room,
but so far there's no sign

241
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,307
of a telltale tie pin.

00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,244
or fake evidence
that they're trying to plant?

336
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,538
Okay, how we gonna play this game?

337
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,540
You said it.

338
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,834
Your chums like playing games.

339
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,046
Let's give them a taste
of their own medicine.

340
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,594
Aunt Cricket. We're so thrilled
you were able to join us

341
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,513
and that you brought Cousin Fester.

342
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,098
Well, I wanted witnesses

343
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,642
so we don't go missing
the way Bedford did.

344
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:04,893
Don't be silly.

345
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,146
Dinner will be ready soon.

346
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,773
Can I offer you
some mulled berry wine to start?

347
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,485
[oil bubbling]

348
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,495
-Hey, Archie.
-What's up, Eddie?

349
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,373
You see those people over there?

350
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,877
I've seen them before at the arcade.

351
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,130
They're Dodger's family.

352
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,508
What the hell?

353
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,843
You sure?

354
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,141
All right. Thanks for the heads-up.
Go grab a seat, I'll take care of it.

355
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,559
And, hey, be cool.

356
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,031
I'm not sure what you're here for,
but you and your boys need to leave.

357
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,949
We've got kids here.
We don't want any trouble.

358
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,161
We don't want any trouble either.

359
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,626
But we've come for the man
who tried to kill our Dodger.

360
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,712
Got a feeling he's you.

361
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,506
Or one of your friends.

362
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,093
I swear to you,
no one here tried to hurt Dodger.

363
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,470
Well, someone did.

364
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,474
And whoever it is,
he's got a real soft spot for this place.

365
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:30,020
We think we hang out here long enough,
he'll show.

366
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,898
[Darla] In the meantime...

367
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,485
how about some of that delicious food
I'm smelling?

368
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,697
You guys remember back in high school
when we all used to hang out together?

369
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,825
Us griping about how horrible
our parents were?

370
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,744
And now we're the horrible parents.

371
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,123
Fred never complained about his folks,
not once.

372
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,502
And look what an amazing father
he turned out to be.

373
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,172
I think we could all take a lesson
from that, huh?

374
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,090
Yeah.

375
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:03,011
Hey, what say we continue
this downstairs over drinks?

376
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,472
-Yes, yes.
-Huh? To toast Fred.

377
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,976
What do you say, FP, huh?
You're not on duty, are you?

378
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,939
Why the hell not, Mr. Mayor?

379
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,441
[Hermione and Hiram chuckle]

380
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:20,612
Well, considering we are trapped here
until the morning at least,

381
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,907
let's say we pass the time with a game
of Never Have I Ever.

382
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,743
I do love a good salacious drinking game.

383
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,620
I'll start.

384
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,958
Never have I ever kissed a girl.

385
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,545
Betty.

386
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,759
Never have I ever...

387
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,636
done drugs.

388
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,935
Jones, I'm surprised. Isn't Riverdale
like the drug capital of the world?

389
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,023
Never have I ever...

390
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:57,899
been in a gang.

391
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,528
[Donna] Really?

392
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,156
But you look so sweet.

393
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,783
Oh, well, I'm not as sweet
as you might think.

394
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,542
Never have I ever been
in a secret society.

395
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,883
Oops, looks like you lose that round,
Forsythe.

396
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,551
Now you gotta finish the whole flask.

397
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,600
[Betty] Time for a refill.

398
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,351
I'll go get the bottle
from your room, Jug.

399
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:22,734
Jug, I found this tie pin in Donna's room,
and it has an engraving on the back.

400
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,986
The initials RC.

401
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,240
-What was Mr. Chipping's first name?
-Rupert.

402
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,076
These are his initials.
How does Donna have this?

403
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,746
Killers often take something
from their victim

404
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,873
as a souvenir or trophy.

405
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,257
How long can this go on for?

406
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,717
We have to fight back.

407
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,096
No offense to your guns, Munroe,
but they have real ones.

408
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,265
If I can get into the office, in my desk,

409
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,309
I have a drawer full of weapons
that I confiscated off the kids,

410
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,310
knives, switchblades--

411
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,603
Now hold on.

412
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,689
I'm not sure I endorse this plan.

413
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,316
Adding more weapons to the stew?
One of those kids could get hurt.

414
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,573
-[Fagan] Ooh.
-[Bill] Whoo!

415
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,907
[Darla] Mmm.

416
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,829
-[Munroe] Malcolm!
-What you doing?

417
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,290
-Want this?
-Relax! He didn't know what he was doing.

418
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,875
Don't do it! He's just a kid.

419
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,418
Everyone, stay back.

420
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,128
[Mary] Archie!

421
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,713
That's for my brother.

422
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,467
You know what I think, Carrot Top?

423
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,846
I think you've got a hero complex.

424
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,849
You know what else I think?

425
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,895
I think you beat my boy Dodger
into a coma,

426
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,398
and then you called an ambulance
so no one would suspect you.

427
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,942
But a mother, she knows.

428
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:47,777
And you...

429
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,031
you are gonna pay for what you've done!

430
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,700
Now get your ass down!

431
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,753
[oil bubbling]

432
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:05,670
Say it.

433
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,131
Say it's you.

434
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,383
You're the one who almost killed my son.

435
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,718
Ms. Dickenson, please...

436
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,013
whatever it is that you think
you have to do, you don't.

437
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:15,931
Say it!

438
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,767
Confess, boy,

439
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,895
before things start getting
real ugly in here.

440
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,443
If I say it...

441
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,446
you'll let everyone else here go?

442
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,073
Then you can do whatever you want to me.

443
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,199
I'll take that deal.

444
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,452
But I need to hear you say it.

445
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,038
Fine.

446
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,626
[Eddie] Please, stop, stop. It's me!

447
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,503
I wear the mask! I'm the dark dude!

448
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,004
-Leave Archie alone!
-Eddie, shut up.

449
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,297
It's not him.

450
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,757
It's me! The mask is mine.

451
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,676
Toby, sit down and shut up.

452
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,135
I'm the guy you want.

453
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,387
[Darla] That's enough!

454
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,391
Now, that was a touching display.

455
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,520
Hell, another day, I might've even cried.

456
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,854
But not today.

457
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,941
I already spilt all my tears over my son.

458
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:08,984
And, boy,

459
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,780
your mother is gonna find out exactly
what that feels like.

460
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,783
[all gasp]

461
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,161
Go! Get in the office! Go, go, go!

462
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,256
-[screams]
-Don't even try it.

463
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,260
Stop! Step away from my son!

464
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,973
I have the right to protect myself
against intruders with deadly force.

465
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,641
So, unless you want me to use it,

466
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,978
you have exactly five seconds
to get the hell out of here.

467
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,855
One...

468
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:48,898
two...

469
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,526
-three...
-[groans]

470
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,737
four...

471
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,786
Lock the door behind them.
Let's call the police.

472
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,829
Mrs. Andrews.

473
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,457
I'm obsessed.

474
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,585
Yeah, Mom, since when are you Dirty Harry?

475
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,588
What was that explosion?

476
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,770
Who in their right mind tries
to deep-fry a turkey inside?

477
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,359
[jazz music playing over speakers]

478
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,489
You're nursing it, FP. What's the matter?
You don't like my rum?

479
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,615
[FP scoffs]

480
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,744
Well, someone's gotta be clear-headed
enough to drive the rest of you home.

481
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,248
FP...

482
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,460
you know, I sensed
that you were upset with me

483
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,713
when I asked you to shut down
Archie's community center earlier.

484
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,260
Anyway, I appreciate your cooperation.

485
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,848
-I'm gonna make this clear, Hiram.
-FP.

486
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,392
I am not your puppet.

487
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,561
When I took this job,
I pledged to serve and protect Riverdale,

488
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,896
not to do your bidding.

489
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,489
-Why don't you settle down?
-Mm-hm.

490
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:20,949
What's the matter?

491
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,620
You put a hit out on my son, you bastard.
You think I forgot about that?

492
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:28,373
Yeah. Is that why you tried to murder me

493
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,625
at the behest of my own wife?

494
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,252
[Hermione] Hiram.

495
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,713
[Alice] FP!

496
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,758
FP.

497
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,262
Finish it.

498
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,472
Do it.

499
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,975
-Or get the hell off me.
-FP.

500
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,476
[Hiram] Come on.

501
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,853
I'm not gonna do it,

502
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,312
but you deserve it.

503
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,899
Everyone in this room,
hell, everyone in this town,

504
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,860
knows that you deserve it!

505
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,365
[bottle shatters]

506
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,997
[Cheryl] Whilst we all tuck
into our delicious homemade meat pies,

507
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,583
might I suggest we reminisce
about some Thanksgivings of yore?

508
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,462
Nana, will you regale us?

509
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,755
Well...

510
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:22,594
there is the story
of the first Blossom Thanksgiving,

511
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,513
but it's a dark chapter.

512
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,265
Deeply dark.

513
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,183
That's fine.

514
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,059
I'd love to hear more about your family,

515
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,895
warts and all.

516
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,355
[Nana] The weather turned,

517
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,610
and the Blossom settlers were surprised by

518
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,615
a sudden brutal onset of ice.

519
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,576
Much like tonight.

520
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:50,205
The wagons were snowed in, and soon after,

521
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,249
the hunger set in.

522
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,586
Deep.

523
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,714
Aching.

524
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,383
Gnawing.

525
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:08,431
Stomachs groaning so loud,
they drowned out the wind until...

526
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,350
Until what, Nana?

527
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,647
The Blossoms turned on one another.

528
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,691
They had to eat their own.

529
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,819
Survive...

530
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,322
on Blossom flesh.

531
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:25,990
[Fester gulps]

532
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,786
Do you mean... cannibalism?

533
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:35,375
Why, I can only imagine what a scandal
like that would do to our family name,

534
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,628
especially if it were to come out
right as Aunt Cricket were attempting

535
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,713
to negotiate a sale
for our maple business.

536
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,843
Please. No one would believe that snuff.

537
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,469
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

538
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,931
We Blossoms have always been
highly carnivorous.

539
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,558
I mean...

540
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,644
I ate my brother Julian in the womb.

541
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,940
And you're eating those meat pies
we prepared especially for you.

542
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,235
[grunts] My tooth.

543
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,905
What on earth?

544
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,034
[Cricket] What...?

545
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,245
Is this Uncle Bedford's ring?

546
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,582
What does this mean?

547
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,417
It means, Aunt Cricket...

548
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,211
that you're welcome to search the house.

549
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,589
It means that Uncle Bedford...

550
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,883
will never be found.

551
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,594
It means that any evidence
he was ever here...

552
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,891
is in the process of being... digested.

553
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,311
In other words...

554
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,396
I think you know what it means.

555
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,189
You...

556
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,608
You're bluffing.

557
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:46,529
Not even you are deranged enough to commit
such an unspeakable abomination.

558
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,114
On the contrary.

559
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,410
[gasps] Which reminds me,
it's time for dessert.

560
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:53,620
Tee-Tee?

561
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,914
[Fester screams]

562
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,124
[Cheryl] Face facts, Aunt Cricket.

563
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,753
You and Cousin Fester have just committed
a vile act of cannibalism,

564
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,755
which is illegal in this state.

565
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,132
So, unless you want the world
to learn as much,

566
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,593
you will leave us the hell alone.

567
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,429
You do not knock on my door.
You do not harass my girlfriend.

568
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:15,183
You do not ask me to sell off
my Blossom legacy ever again.

569
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,517
Are we clear?

570
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,939
Now, would you like me to pack up
the rest of Bedford for you in Tupperware?

571
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,941
[gagging]

572
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,109
Fester!

573
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,530
-[door opens, then closes]
-[Cheryl giggles]

574
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,455
There you two are.
We thought you'd been murdered.

575
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,874
No dice on the booze, I see.

576
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,292
Not a drop to be found.

577
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,921
But I say we keep playing the game,
and I'll go next.

578
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,549
Never have I ever tried
to cover up a murder.

579
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,348
Oh, you guys are just so cool.
You know that?

580
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,477
You're never breaking a sweat,
never betraying an emotion.

581
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,272
Hell, writing fake suicide notes,
how cool is that?

582
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,735
But you guys aren't as devious
as you think.

583
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,030
Otherwise, you wouldn't have left
incriminating evidence,

584
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,658
like Mr. Chipping's tie pin.

585
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,952
You went into my room?

586
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,579
It was an accident.
I mean, all the doors look the same.

587
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,623
[Jughead] Between the suicide note
and the tie pin,

588
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,543
you two are trying to cover up something
about Mr. Chipping's suicide.

589
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:24,961
Or was it a murder?

590
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,504
Care to explain?

591
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,132
You were there, Jones.

592
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:30,925
You saw him jump.

593
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,885
No one pushed him out that window.

594
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,262
Not physically.

595
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,474
But psychologically, Mr. Chipping could've
been pushed to the edge.

596
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,525
Donna.

597
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:52,488
How? Where... did you get this?
We just wanna know the truth.

598
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,532
Mr. Chipping gave it to me, okay?

599
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:55,867
We were having an affair.

600
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,250
I knew it was wrong,

601
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,754
and I didn't want anybody
to get into trouble,

602
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,797
so I tried to break it off with him.

603
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,968
But then he got aggressive.

604
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,803
I was so scared.

605
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,557
I told him if he didn't stop,
I'd go to the headmaster, and then...

606
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,478
the next day, he jumped out the window.

607
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,484
I can't live my life
doing Hiram's bidding, Alice.

608
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,654
I'm not cut out for it.
There's too much blood on the tracks.

609
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:38,034
-I hear you.
-I am a Serpent, Alice. I'm a Serpent.

610
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,288
Every bone in my body is a Serpent.

611
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,376
Okay. So, is there a rule that says
that you can't be both?

612
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,426
That's not bad.

613
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,222
If Hiram can be mayor and a kingpin,

614
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,265
who says that I can't be sheriff...

615
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,017
and a gang leader?

616
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,231
[Alice chuckles]

617
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,362
How are you feeling, my love?

618
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,908
I think, relieved.

619
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,287
Am I crazy, or did we just manage
to pull our plan off?

620
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,622
The latter.

621
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,835
By morning,
Sweetwater River will have frozen over,

622
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,087
and Aunt Cricket
and Cousin Fester will be back

623
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,548
in whatever ring of hell
they typically inhabit,

624
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:37,009
digesting those yummy Iamb meat pies.

625
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,430
And Uncle Bedford's name
will never be spoken aloud again.

626
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,684
I do feel some kind of peace,

627
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,769
in some weird way.

628
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,106
We defended our home
from hostile invaders.

629
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,985
And for the rest of the weekend,

630
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,362
we have nothing to worry about
but ourselves.

631
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,995
And... something I haven't yet said.

632
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,710
I love you...

633
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,588
and I'm so grateful to you.

634
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,756
Yeah, I love you, too, babe.

635
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,427
And happy Thanksgiving.

636
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,814
I'm just so confused.

637
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,525
This whole time,
Mr. Chipping was the bad guy?

638
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,111
It wasn't Bret or Mr. DuPont?

639
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,405
And poor Donna...

640
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:44,285
I'm not so sure
that Donna isn't playing us, Jug.

641
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,872
What do you mean?
Are you saying she made all of that up?

642
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,166
Well, I don't wanna say that
because there's a possibility

643
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,918
that they had a harrowing affair.

644
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:58,466
But there's a possibility
in which the story that she told me

645
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,595
was just to stall us from uncovering
the real truth.

646
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,017
You should just talk
to your headmaster, Jug.

647
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,979
I mean, get it on his radar that something
weird is happening at this school.

648
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,981
Yeah. That's a good idea.

649
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,483
I will.

650
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,696
Hey, I was thinking maybe, if the storm
clears up by tomorrow morning,

651
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,240
that we can go home for the weekend.

652
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,367
Sure. In the meantime, how...?

653
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,369
How will we stay warm tonight?

654
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,998
[Betty giggling]

655
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,173
Before we start...

656
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,843
we were never
a particularly religious house,

657
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,846
but the one thing we always did,

658
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,933
the one thing
my husband always liked to do

659
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,727
when we sat down together
to eat as a family,

660
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,646
was to say grace.

661
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,440
He believed in that.

662
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,986
Archie, would you do the honors?

663
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,529
Yeah.

664
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:09,620
Bless us, O Lord, for these, the gifts,
which we are about to receive.

665
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,581
For this day, for this food,

666
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,627
for our family, for our friends,
we thank you. Amen.

667
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,379
-[Veronica] Amen.
-Amen.

668
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,547
And then he would say...

669
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,091
Dig in, everyone.

670
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,760
I'm grateful to be alive
and to be here with you.

671
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,855
What's this about, sheriff?

672
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,316
Dodger Dickenson's family is at-large
and dangerous.

673
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,485
And we have reason to believe they might
try to get to him before they skip town.

674
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,988
Well, we monitor our patients
fairly closely.

675
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,410
Well, not closely enough, huh, doc?

676
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,333
Ah. Excuse me, headmaster?

677
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,419
[inaudible dialogue]

678
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,305
[Jughead] What's that all about?

679
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,601
Donna came clean to the headmaster
about her affair with Chipping.

680
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,395
How he basically abused and harassed her.

681
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,442
She was trying to protect his family,
prevent any further pain,

682
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,653
but after Betty broke into her room,

683
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,032
Donna felt like she had no choice
but to talk to the authorities

684
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,868
about all the awful things
Chipping did to her.

685
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,040
Well, I guess there's no doubt
about it anymore.

686
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,793
Chipping's death was a suicide,

687
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,712
driven by a guilty man's fear of exposure.

688
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,551
Case closed, Detective Jones.

689
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,873
[playing ballad]

690
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,259
Archie?

691
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,889
Yesterday was, without a doubt,

692
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,267
the strangest Thanksgiving I've ever had.

693
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,770
I mean, I pointed a gun at a woman.

694
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,814
Welcome to Riverdale, Mom.

695
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:47,319
Yeah, it's a far cry from me, you and Dad
eating fried turkey and watching football.

696
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:52,241
He never made it past the third quarter.
He fell asleep on the couch.

697
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:59,665
You know, I've been thinking about
that deep fryer exploding when it did.

698
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,543
I mean, what are the odds of that?

699
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,213
-That saved us, Archie.
-Yeah, we got lucky, Mom.

700
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,132
No, that wasn't luck.

701
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,843
That was your dad watching out for us.

702
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,221
I think you're right.

703
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,932
And that gives me an idea.

704
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,269
[applause]

705
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,115
What do you think, Mom?

706
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,910
Your father never would've believed this.

707
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,662
Everything you've been building here.

708
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:40,956
All of you.

709
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,334
He'd be honored...

710
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,878
and so proud.
