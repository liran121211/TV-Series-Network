00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:52,035
Was he trying to screw you over?

698
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:53,304
Oh, my God.

699
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:57,533
- I have to change it.
- Change what?

700
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:59,241
My story, I have to fix it.

701
00:36:04,091 --> 00:36:06,734
[JUGHEAD] <i>The problem with believing
you have all the answers,</i>

702
00:36:06,736 --> 00:36:09,528
<i>is that is blinds you to the truth
that's right before your eyes.</i>

703
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,818
[DOOR CREAKING]

704
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:18,661
Mr. Honey.

705
00:36:18,664 --> 00:36:20,217
[TYPING]

706
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,145
Ronnie, what do we do?

707
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:23,664
Call 911.

708
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:26,377
- No if we do that...
- If we don't, he'll die.

709
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,423
Call 911. I'll give him CPR.

710
00:36:29,425 --> 00:36:31,150
[TYPING]

711
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:34,556
Uh, yeah. We need an ambulance.

712
00:36:44,477 --> 00:36:46,077
What the hell happened?

713
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,232
It's okay. The doctors
said Honey's gonna make it.

714
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:49,919
No, I'm more worried about us.

715
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:52,820
Okay. What do the police
know? What did you tell them?

716
00:36:52,823 --> 00:36:54,332
The truth.

717
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:56,283
That this all started
as some stupid prank

718
00:36:56,285 --> 00:36:57,835
and that things got out of hand.

719
00:36:57,837 --> 00:37:00,106
A prank? Do you realize
what you've done?

720
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:02,247
Yeah, we kept a man from dying.

721
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,525
And ruined our lives.

722
00:37:03,528 --> 00:37:06,250
Reggie's right, you guys just
wrecked everything, our futures,

723
00:37:06,253 --> 00:37:07,770
now none of us are gonna go to college.

724
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:09,524
Who cares about college?
Don't you guys understand

725
00:37:09,526 --> 00:37:12,875
that we could spend the next 20
years of our lives in Shankshaw...

726
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:14,569
Shankshaw prison?

727
00:37:14,571 --> 00:37:16,762
Are you listening to yourselves?

728
00:37:16,764 --> 00:37:18,533
Mr. Honey could've died.

729
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,202
We would've been murderers.

730
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:23,557
Better that than what's
coming next for all of us.

731
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,229
You don't mean that, Betty, do you?

732
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:28,608
That you would've
preferred Mr. Honey to die?

733
00:37:31,445 --> 00:37:32,896
[BETTY] What made you rewrite it?

734
00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:36,490
Guess I finally realized
what I was saying,

735
00:37:36,492 --> 00:37:37,773
how I was saying it.

736
00:37:39,545 --> 00:37:43,473
I've been reveling in this
town's sickness and I was...

737
00:37:43,475 --> 00:37:46,458
enjoying the suffering
of another person,

738
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,894
even if it was Mr. Honey.

739
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:53,056
This is about Mr. Honey's letter.

740
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:54,108
Isn't it?

741
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:58,512
What does he say in it?

742
00:37:58,514 --> 00:38:00,013
Hey, guys.

743
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:04,151
Hey, Jellybean, uh, now
is not the best time.

744
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:05,736
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt,

745
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:07,455
but this was on our doorstep.

746
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:27,741
More house shots?

747
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:31,021
Maybe it's another copycat?

748
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:35,191
- Maybe it's an invitation.
- Yeah, but where?

749
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:37,217
That place doesn't even
look like it's in Riverdale.

750
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:38,942
No, but I've seen this place before.

751
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:45,017
That's the cabin where Veronica's
mom killed Sheriff Minetta.

752
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:46,434
Where they had their affair.

753
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,955
I'll go get my keys.

754
00:39:39,615 --> 00:39:40,964
What's that for?

755
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:44,877
Look like a makeshift screen.

756
00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:50,677
This projector reminds me of the
one we used to have at the drive-in.

757
00:39:51,603 --> 00:39:53,091
There's no film in it, though.

758
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,015
Jug.

759
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:26,877
[MR. HONEY] <i>Dear Headmaster Koontz,</i>

760
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:29,472
<i>Greetings from Riverdale High.</i>

761
00:40:29,474 --> 00:40:33,458
<i>I wanted to follow up on our
conversation with a short note.</i>

762
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,813
<i>Though Jughead Jones has had an
incredibly difficult year, as you know,</i>

763
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:40,891
<i>and I've only interacted
with him a scant few times,</i>

764
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:42,893
<i>he is a special kid,</i>

765
00:40:42,895 --> 00:40:45,345
<i>and a superb writer.</i>

766
00:40:45,347 --> 00:40:46,989
<i>But he needs a break.</i>

767
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:50,568
<i>He needs good teachers
and a healthy environment,</i>

768
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,186
<i>which I know the University
of Iowa can provide.</i>

769
00:40:53,188 --> 00:40:55,739
<i>I don't say this lightly,</i>

770
00:40:55,741 --> 00:40:57,679
<i>but I do believe Jughead Jones</i>

771
00:40:57,682 --> 00:41:01,091
<i>will be an important
voice of his generation.</i>

772
00:41:01,094 --> 00:41:03,201
<i>If you'd like to discuss him further,</i>

773
00:41:03,204 --> 00:41:05,256
<i>please call me at any time.</i>

774
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:07,418
<i>All my best to you and Edith.</i>

775
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,780
<i>Sincerely, Holden Honey.</i>
