1
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,176
[Jughead] <i>"Honor,"</i>

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,012
<i>a word that gets thrown around a lot</i>
<i>at Stonewall Prep.</i>

3
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:17,183
Mr. Weston Wallis, you have been
challenged to a duel by Mr. Jones,

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,311
who has invoked
arcane Stonewall Prep tradition.

5
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:21,813
Do you accept?

6
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,900
-That'd be a yes.
-Very good.

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,029
-What about fencing?
-Can we just bare-knuckle brawl?

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,823
May I suggest that you do both?

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,117
And in case of a tiebreaker...

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,493
A battle of intellect.

11
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,328
A chess match.

12
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,663
Excellent.

13
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,332
Then it is settled.

14
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,212
You may both now choose a second
for moral and tactical support.

15
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,964
I pick Jonathan.

16
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:50,800
I'll choose Donna.

17
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,052
And may the best man win.

18
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,851
I'm assuming you've never held
a saber before.

19
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:05,732
Lucky for you, I'm an excellent coach, and
Bret is decidedly mediocre with a sword.

20
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:13,281
Hey, by the way, I meant to ask you,
when's your mom get back?

21
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,743
She's wrapping up a case.
A couple more days, she says.

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,162
-Gotcha.
-[door closes]

23
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,415
Hey, can we help you?

24
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,294
Holy hell.

25
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,422
Ted Bishop.

26
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,216
How are you, Frank?

27
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,470
Hey.

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,265
-What the hell are you doing here?
-It's, uh--

29
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,059
It's bad news.

30
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,979
I'm making the rounds,
I wanted to tell you guys in person.

31
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,648
Greg died.

32
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,735
-Yeah, he had cancer.
-Ah.

33
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,986
Rotted his guts.

34
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,364
After everything else...

35
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,408
I'm sorry. Uh...

36
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,285
Archie, this is Ted Bishop.
We served together.

37
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,663
-Ted, this is my nephew Archie.
-Hey.

38
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,749
-Fred's kid. Nice to meet you.
-Same.

39
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,795
We were just calling it quits for the day,
if you wanna join us for dinner?

40
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,965
Yeah. How about it, Ted?

41
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,758
Yeah, all right.

42
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:24,060
FYI, Smithers and I are road-tripping
to New York tomorrow.

43
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,478
Oh, what's the occasion?

44
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,439
I have an interview at Barnard College,
if you must know.

45
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,192
And of course, I'll be going
on a shopping spree beforehand

46
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,861
to find the right outfit to impress.

47
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,947
Perfect timing. Your mother and I were
just planning our own trip to New York.

48
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,242
Seriously?

49
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,245
Yeah. I have a few business meetings
I've been putting off.

50
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,206
And I'm having lunch with the girls
at Café des Creatifs.

51
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,709
Don't worry, <i>mija,</i>
as soon as we reach Manhattan,

52
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,502
we'll go our separate ways.

53
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,670
Fine.

54
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,923
But New York... is my town.

55
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,884
Not yours.

56
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,386
[school bell rings]

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,520
Fangs, tell me
you're not selling drugs again.

58
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,106
Toni...

59
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,568
so Kevin and I started this little...

60
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,695
side hustle.

61
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,532
And don't worry,
it's nothing illegal per se.

62
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,117
What kind of side hustle?

63
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,745
It looks lucrative as hell.

64
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,539
Is this something I can get in on?

65
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,257
The nerve of that man!
Who does he think he is?

66
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,176
What happened, Mom?
What did Mr. Honey say?

67
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,679
Your principal refuses to believe
that I acted alone.

68
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,514
That's typical.

69
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,016
What's the punishment?

70
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,518
Well, honey, you're suspended for a week

71
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:52,273
and stripped of your editor-in-chief
duties at <i>The Blue and Gold.</i>

72
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,233
Oh, my God.

73
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,278
And barred from attending senior prom,
for some ungodly reason.

74
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,908
Oh, and that Bret Weston Wallis character?

75
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,160
He's filing a restraining order
against you,

76
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,828
claiming that he "fears for his life."

77
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,539
What, Bret is afraid of me? Why?

78
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,709
Apparently, you cracked open his head
with a golf club?

79
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,211
Oh, right, I did do that.

80
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,427
What's this?

81
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,263
My latest murder board.

82
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,098
[Alice] Who got murdered?

83
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,934
Mr. Chipping. Maybe.

84
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,354
We let the case get cold,

85
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,190
but we know Bret's a total sociopath.

86
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,944
Let's find out if he's a killer, too.

87
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,414
So, there was an ambush
near the city center,

88
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,250
and they sent us in
to extract any wounded.

89
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,752
I end up walking down a blind alley.

90
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,840
I get hit in both legs, and I go down.

91
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,301
But he got me out of there.

92
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,723
It wasn't till we got back
to the aid station, I saw that Frank,

93
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,183
he'd been hit four times himself.

94
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,231
But, hey, you got a Red Badge of Courage
for saving my ass, right?

95
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,859
I got lucky, that's all.

96
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,362
Well, boys, uh,

97
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,450
I appreciate the warm meal
and hospitality, but it's time I ship out.

98
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,785
You can stay here if you want, Mr. Bishop.

99
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,163
My mom's out of town,
there's plenty of room.

100
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,708
-As long as I'm not putting anyone out.
-No, you're not.

101
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,380
[Alice] My, what a tangled web.

102
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,091
And you think
this Bret character is behind it all?

103
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,928
He's definitely the leader of the pack.

104
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,307
Okay. Well, where do we begin?

105
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,270
We have missing students, evil preppies,
dead writers, a teacher's suicide--

106
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,064
Apparent suicide.

107
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,690
Chipping didn't leave a note.

108
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,818
And even though Jughead's classmate Donna

109
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,738
has painted
a very incriminating portrait of him...

110
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,200
I don't think she's telling the truth.

111
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,951
Well, then, that's where we start.

112
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,120
Tell me, Elizabeth,

113
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,372
is there a Mrs. Chipping?

114
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,339
Hey, where's the fire?

115
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,466
Sorry, I'm gonna be late for school.

116
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,052
Ted, don't be a stranger.
Hope to see you again soon.

117
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,221
-Yeah, same here.
-See you.

118
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,224
He's a good kid.

119
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,519
He is. He's just like his father was.

120
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,731
Listen, why don't you finish up and
then I'll drive you to the bus station?

121
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,690
Sounds good.

122
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,194
[cell phone buzzing]

123
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,201
-Hello?
-[on phone] <i>Frank, it's June. Listen.</i>

124
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,369
-June?
<i>-I don't have a lot---</i>

125
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,288
-Whoa, whoa, slow down. Slow down, wait.
<i>-Duckie was murdered.</i>

126
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,374
<i>-He said something about...</i>
-What happened to Duckie?

127
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,251
[June speaking indistinctly on phone]

128
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,379
I don't understand, how can he be dead,
too? That doesn't make any...

129
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,862
{\an8}What the hell's going on?

130
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,874
{\an8}I forgot my phone.

131
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,256
{\an8}I'm sorry, Archie.

132
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,133
{\an8}I usually have an instinct
about these things.

133
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,136
{\an8}Uncle Frank, why the hell is one
of your friends trying to kill you?

134
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,597
{\an8}After the war, I was hard up.

135
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,267
{\an8}Ted reached out,
and he told me about this security gig.

136
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,728
{\an8}It paid well, hired vets,
no questions asked.

137
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,315
{\an8}The thing is,
it was a private paramilitary contractor,

138
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,900
{\an8}and they sent us all over the world...

139
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,319
{\an8}as mercenaries.

140
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,197
{\an8}Okay, so why come after you?

141
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,450
{\an8}My guess is,
the company's tying up loose ends.

142
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,077
{\an8}Maybe they're about to be exposed,
Ted's still on the payroll.

143
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,829
{\an8}So, get ahead of this.

144
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,749
{\an8}You come forward
and blow the lid off these mercenaries.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,627
{\an8}It's not that easy, Archie.

146
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,295
{\an8}I was a part of it.

147
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,630
I did things. I--

148
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,882
{\an8}I followed orders.

149
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,551
{\an8}-Then we need to get you out of town.
-No.

150
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,345
{\an8}It's too dangerous.

151
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,807
{\an8}Anybody he comes into contact with
in this town is at risk now.

152
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,643
{\an8}He's not gonna leave till I'm dead.

153
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,312
-Well, in that case, we need backup.
-No way.

154
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,899
No. Uncle Frank, trust me,
this guy can help.

155
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,153
{\an8}Thank you for coming to see us,
Mrs. Chipping.

156
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,156
We can't even imagine
how hard this has been for you.

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,117
{\an8}And we promise, we're just here to help.

158
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,620
This first question is the hardest.

159
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,372
{\an8}The answer is no.

160
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:04,752
{\an8}I absolutely do not believe my husband
was having an affair with that student.

161
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,005
{\an8}And Rupert, he had his problems,

162
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,508
{\an8}but he never cheated on me, not ever.

163
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,552
What kind of problems?

164
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,387
{\an8}Drinking more than usual,

165
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,306
complaining about
the Baxter Brothers books,

166
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,475
wishing he'd never gotten the contract.

167
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,563
{\an8}Wasn't he proud to be
a Baxter Brothers writer?

168
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,855
In the beginning.

169
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,609
{\an8}But then, as the years went on...

170
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,780
{\an8}he felt like he had an albatross
around his neck.

{\an8}Why... kill himself if he was so close
to being done?

173
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,874
{\an8}I don't know.

174
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,336
{\an8}I just-- I-- I don't know.

175
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,756
{\an8}And I, um...

176
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,553
{\an8}I brought a box of his personal effects
from when I cleaned out his office.

{\an8}I can't make sense of any of it...

{\an8}We'll try, Mrs. Chipping.

180
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,690
What does any of this mean?

181
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,821
Why does Mr. Chipping have Army pamphlets?

Unless...

183
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,077
Wait a minute.

{\an8}A highly trained mercenary tried
to kill you two in the kitchen

185
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,876
{\an8}and now he's in hiding,
waiting to strike again?

-I'm his target, not Archie.

for my mistakes.

I've been in a couple of bar fights
with these ultra-Marine types.

191
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,268
They're tough bastards,
but I've held my own against them.

192
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,479
Can you lure him out, Uncle Frank?

193
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,399
It would have to be somewhere
under our complete control.

We got that. The gym.

195
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,323
All right.

No, he says that you do, in a collection.

00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,085
was at my quinceañera at the Plaza.

341
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,089
And you told me his palms were sweaty

342
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,966
because he was so nervous.

343
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,052
Oh, my God, that is so embarrassing.
I can't believe you remember that.

344
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,722
All I remember is that
the Jonas Brothers performed.

345
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,807
-Mm-hm.
-And of course, how stunning you looked.

346
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,393
Yeah, because you
and your mom made the dress,

347
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:50,439
the dress that launched this beautiful,
unexpected relationship.

348
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,692
How is your mother? How is her shop?

349
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,280
Veronica, my mom's really sick.

350
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,409
And she's getting treatments, and she's--

351
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,245
Oh, she's being so strong.

352
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,247
But, um...

353
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,376
they caught it late, so we're just...

354
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,962
We're not sure what's gonna happen.

355
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,425
[sighs] She's my best friend, Veronica.

356
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,427
Katy...

357
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,638
Ugh. I'm sorry.

358
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,767
I didn't wanna tell you.
I didn't wanna cry today.

359
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,477
Are you kidding me?

360
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,856
What are old friends for,
if not to provide shoulders to cry on?

361
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,025
Come here.

362
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,154
I love you, Katy Keene.

363
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,823
You're gonna be okay, I promise.

364
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,244
-Where are you gonna go?
-Head up to Canada.

365
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,454
Maybe find my way to Alaska,
get some work.

366
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,832
Gotta get as far off the radar as possible
until this whole thing blows over.

367
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,542
If Ted can find me, others can, too.

368
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,254
Uncle Frank, can't you just talk
to the feds, explain what happened?

369
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,714
Maybe if you turn yourself in,
they'll go easy on you.

370
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,300
Or maybe they make me the scapegoat
who goes down for all of this.

371
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,302
Those tend to be the breaks
I get in life, Archie.

372
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,305
If you go on the run now,
you'll never stop running.

373
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,516
Man, you remind me so much
of your old man.

374
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,686
You take care of your mom, okay?
Or I'll come back and kick your ass.

375
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:12,938
You can try.

376
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,529
[Toni] <i>Babe, what happened to you today?</i>

377
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,989
You ghosted me.

378
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,493
Do you remember that Patrick Bateman-type
from earlier today, at the Maple Club?

379
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,371
Mmm. You mean Nick St. Clair?

380
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,416
Sophomore year...

381
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,170
Nick came to Riverdale one weekend
looking for a party.

382
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,090
He...

383
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,051
spiked my champagne...

384
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,679
and...

385
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,141
coaxed me back to his room
at the Five Seasons...

386
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,643
where...

387
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,396
he attempted to assault me.

388
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,314
What?

389
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:59,693
Thankfully, Veronica and Josie
and the Pussycats came to my rescue.

390
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,448
I thought I'd worked through it...
emotionally.

391
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,701
-But seeing him today, it...
-Triggered you.

392
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,121
I get it.

393
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,001
A similar experience happened to me
before I moved to Riverdale.

394
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,627
Tee-Tee.

395
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,504
I'm so sorry.

396
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,505
What did you do?

397
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,924
How did you cope?

398
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,594
It took me a while,

399
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,305
but with a lot of help,
I worked through it.

400
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,643
Babe, I wanna help you get there, too.

401
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,609
Gentlemen, we'll go seven rounds.

402
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:44,029
-We're not gonna need rounds.
-No. All we'll need is a coffin for Jones,

403
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,323
like the one I buried him in
way back when.

404
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,742
Round 1 begins now.

405
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,335
That's not bad, Bret.

406
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:04,800
Oh.

407
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,802
Well, he's got a glass jaw.

408
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,887
Told you we weren't gonna need rounds.

409
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,931
Mr. Jones is the winner.

410
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,599
The duel is officially tied.

411
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,435
Tomorrow's chess match will decide
the ultimate winner.

412
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,859
Oh, crap.

413
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,396
A dead snake, really?

414
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,690
And body checks in the hall?

415
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,567
Since when does Bret even have
so many friends?

416
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,943
He doesn't.

417
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,570
It's pack behavior.

418
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,030
Bret's homegrown,
a Stoney through and through.

419
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:09,990
Easy to root for.

420
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,827
And think about it,
if you win and Bret loses,

421
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,872
if he's not a man of honor,
what does that say about them?

422
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,583
So, what, this entire school is
against me now?

423
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,710
Not the entire school, Jones.

424
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,129
You still got me.

425
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,177
[Alice] <i>If that tape exists,</i>
<i>we have to find it.</i>

426
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,136
Agreed.

427
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,138
But we can't search the whole school.

428
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,433
What if Bret stores his collection

429
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,436
in the room where they have
those secret society meetings?

430
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,563
In Stonewall Prep's basement.

431
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,400
Okay, but we didn't fare so well
breaking into their dorms.

432
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:48,069
No, but Jughead still has
one last challenge.

433
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,697
We can slip into the basement
while he's keeping Bret busy.

[cell phone buzzes]

435

<i>He just about snapped Tubby in two.</i>
<i>Get yourself to safety, okay?</i>

440
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,465
Okay, bye.

441
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,594
Ted?

442
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,572
What the hell is happening?

443
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,581
This school is insane.

444
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,209
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. [coughing]

How...? I thought you were gone.

447
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,384
I had a gut feeling
this wasn't over, Archie.

448
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,594

[Bret] <i>I wanna raise the stakes.</i>

464
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,828
When I win, you walk away
from the Baxter Brothers contract.

00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,162
To what end?

466
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,749
The restoration of the rightful,
natural order of the world.

467
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,502

I'm not going to accept your terms.

00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,605
I almost admire your gumption, Ponytail,
but you're done.

515
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,689
You're trespassing.

516
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,108
And you are illegally recording
people having sex.

517
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,945
-And this is your tape of me and Jughead.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

518
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:51,409
-What the hell is going on?
-Your perv roommate taped us in your bed.

519
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,786
Are you serious, Bret?

520
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,706
All the tapes
in this room are private property.

521
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,835
Consensual testimonies given by students
being inducted into the Quill and Skull.

522
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,547
The tape you're holding right now
is Jughead's initiation confession.

523
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,717
Confession?

524
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,137
I did make a confession.

525
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,723
Right. So, I'll have
my private property back.

526
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,605
Excellent. Now, can we finish the match?

527
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,842
Wait, no, no.
That allows me to put you in--

528
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:50,969
Checkmate, yeah.

529
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,013
Why? Why would you do that?

530
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,182
Because I'm done playing this game, Bret.

531
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,436
That's game over, Mr. DuPont.
Bret wins this duel.

532
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:01,896
You...

533
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,025
are more of a Stonewall man
than I will ever be.

534
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,528
Or I'll ever wanna be.

535
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,072
Let's blow this place.

536
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,585
All right. Thank you, Mr. Jones.
I appreciate it.

537
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:26,421
Okay, bye.

538
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,218
The feds picked up Ted.

539
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,138
He'll be tried for everything he did
in Riverdale.

540
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,473
He said they're looking for you, too.

541
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,225
Of course they are.

542
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,728
My mom's the lawyer, not me,

543
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,105
but wouldn't it go better
if you turn yourself in?

544
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,441
You could cut a deal maybe, too.

545
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,153
All right.

546
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,322
All right, Archie, I'll do it.
I'll turn myself in tomorrow.

547
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,784
I genuinely think this is
the right thing to do, Uncle Frank.

548
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,249
[Hermione] <i>Veronica, your father doesn't</i>
<i>want me to tell you this,</i>

549
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,460
but I think it's important that you know.

550
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,754
We didn't go to New York on business.

551
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,839
We went to see a doctor.

552
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,466
A specialist.

553
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,427
He ran some tests,

554
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,555
and he confirmed
that your father has a disease.

555
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,599
What? What--?

556
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,893
What kind of disease?

557
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,228
It's a neuromuscular disorder.

558
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,523
It will weaken your father.

559
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,985
His muscles will atrophy.

560
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,738
He'll lose his motor skills.

561
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,783
But... there's good news.

562
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,579
I mean, we caught it early,
so there's drugs... and therapies.

563
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,957
So, he's... going to be fine?

564
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,336
We don't know.

565
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,756
We just know that he's very...

566
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,343
He's very sick.

567
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:58,638
Mom.

568
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,099
[Hermione sobs]

569
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:07,814
What...?

570
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,273
Where the hell am I?

571
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,738
-Who the hell are you?
-I bet you say that to all the boys.

572
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,323
[Fangs] It's okay.

573
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,825
Yeah, we understand.

574
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,660
Things got pretty wild last night.

575
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,995
[Toni] You wanna see?

576
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,333
You and the boys here made a little video.

577
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,836
[Nick giggling on video]

578
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:30,920
[Nick] <i>It's too much!</i>

579
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,755
[Fangs] <i>Is it okay?</i>

580
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,216
[Nick laughing on video]

581
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,513
Had enough?

582
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,223
[Nick] How could you?

583
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,391
You can't--

584
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,436
You'd better not show that to anyone,
you bitch, or I'll--

585
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,647
Or you'll what, exactly?

586
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:54,235
Now, listen up, worm,
because I'm only gonna say this once.

587
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,321
You don't know me, but I know you.

588
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,326
And I know exactly what you did
to my girlfriend, Cheryl Blossom,

589
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,373
and what you've probably done to a lot
of other innocent young women.

590
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,501
You will never set foot
in Riverdale again,

591
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,131
you will not so much as even think
about Cheryl Blossom,

592
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,010
and you will never assault another woman.

593
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,931
Because if you do,
I will let the whole world see

594
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,683
what was done to you.

595
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,229
I will ruin you.

596
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,826
[Nick laughing on TV]

597
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,578
<i>Why are you tickling me?</i>

598
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,251
So... So, Nick is what we
in the tickle business would call

599
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,794
a first-class squealer.

600
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,798
I propose a toast.

601
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,761
To Toni Topaz,

602
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,513
who slayed yet another dragon
from my past.

603
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,184
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

604
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,102
Cheers.

605
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:18,236
I am, as always, one lucky lady.

606
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,509
[Archie] <i>Frank didn't even leave a note.</i>

607
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,221
Sorry, Red.

608
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,473
I know you two got close.

609
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,766
Yeah, we did.

610
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,229
But can I tell you, Mr. Jones...

611
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,439
I knew he was gonna run.

612
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,860
Even when he told me he wasn't,
I just... I felt it.

613
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,948
So, uh, what's next?

614
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,284
-Frank is probably halfway to Alaska.
-No, no.

615
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,702
I mean for you.

616
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,830
I don't know.

617
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,919
My dad was a decent, good guy.

618
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,046
He worked hard.

619
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,048
He loved me. He loved his life.

620
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,427
I believe he slept peacefully at night,
you know?

621
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,721
Unless I was out doing some dumbass thing.

622
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,056
Some days he won

623
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,017
and some days he lost.

624
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,979
But usually it was a draw,
and that was enough for him.

625
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,564
It was just that...

626
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,693
He was a simple man with honor.

627
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,865
-Maybe that's what's next for me.
-Mmm.

628
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,495
Sounds like a good plan to me.

629
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,266
Well, Mom, Dad,

630
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,020
I know it's still months away,

631
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,815
but clear your schedules and mark
your calendars for August 15th,

632
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,067
a very special day.

633
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,569
Special in what way?

634
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:28,741
It's when Barnard welcomes
its incoming freshman class,

635
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,160
including a certain Veronica Lodge.

636
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,328
[Hermione] Veronica!

637
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,747
You'll be moving me into my dorm.

638
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,707
I'm sorry, did you say "Lodge"?

639
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,084
Yes.

640
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,128
I did.

641
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,174
Going to New York, seeing Katy,

642
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,511
it reminded me of something I was missing.

643
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,599
But no need to make
a federal case out of it, Daddy.

644
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:54,850
No.

645
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,520
Absolutely not, <i>mija.</i>

646
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,817
[Betty] <i>Any regrets about throwing</i>
<i>the match?</i>

647
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,734
[Jughead] <i>No.</i>

648
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,946
If I've learned anything
over these last couple days,

649
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:10,241
it's that I really don't have
to prove anything to these people.

650
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,119
They have no idea what true honor is.

651
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,497
And you are not a damsel in distress.

652
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,167
But I'll murder Bret
if he actually has a tape of us.

653
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,713
Speaking of tapes, I did manage to sneak
something out of the Quill and Skull room,

654
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,299
a videotape labeled "Donna."

655
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,434
<i>We were having an affair.</i>

656
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:43,858
<i>I knew it was wrong, and I didn't want</i>
<i>anybody to get into trouble,</i>

657
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,901
<i>so I tried to break it off with him.</i>

658
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,613
<i>But then he got...</i>

659
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,158
<i>aggressive.</i>

660
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,285
Wait, what's going on?

661
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,247
This is exactly what Donna told me
about Mr. Chipping except--

662
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,165
Wait for this part.

663
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,460
<i>And I was so scared,</i>
<i>I told him if he didn't stop,</i>

664
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,086
<i>I'd go to the headmaster.</i>

665
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,840
<i>I'd never seen Mr. Kotter so mad.</i>

666
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,301
Who's Mr. Kotter?

667
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,137
Based on my research, no one.

668
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,431
He doesn't exist.

669
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,849
Even more chilling,

670
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,477
Donna is 100 percent using
the same language,

671
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,314
even exactly the same words she used
when she told me about Mr. Chipping.

672
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,233
And I-- I didn't want anybody
to get into trouble

673
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,152
so I tried to break it off with him.

674
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,155
But then he got aggressive.

675
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,034
-Meaning?
-She's lying, Jug.

676
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,872
This is a rehearsed speech
Donna has given at least twice.

677
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,541
All this time, I've been thinking,
we've been thinking,

678
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,461
that Bret's the evil mastermind
behind Stonewall Prep.

679
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,006
But I think we need to be
more worried about Donna.
