Hey, Archie.

You okay?

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,372
Yeah.

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,250
Yeah, I'm great, Uncle Frank.

Not me.

14
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,212
First day as foreman.

15
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,465
Man, I'm more nervous
than when I started basic training.

16
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,841
Nah, you're gonna do awesome.

17
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,385
In fact, I got something for you.

18
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,642
It's Fred's tool belt.

19
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,272
Hey, I can't take another man's gear,
especially not my brother's.

20

Well, you're not taking it,
you're borrowing it.

So do I.

23
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,240

Jug, do not mention him right now, okay?

Yale said what?

[Jughead sighs]

Dr. Beaker, as our chemistry teacher,
we're hoping you have the skill set

56
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,573
to help us with something
of a personal nature.

57
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,825
Are you a rum drinker, Dr. Beaker?

58
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,953
Not during school hours...

59
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,663
and never with students.

60
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,124
Ugh. Calm down, Dr. Egghead.

61
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,211
We're simply asking you to analyze
our maple-based concoction

62
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,298
to ensure that our recipe
is different enough from Lodge Rum.

63
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,552
That way, we can't be sued
or ceased-and-desisted by my father.

64

So, I ask you again, Dr. Beaker...

are you a rum drinker?

66

The board that runs
the Baxter Brothers has taken a look

67
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,522
at the first draft of your book,
and they have a few thoughts.

68
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:55,485
Well, one more global thought.
They would like a new mystery.

69
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,489
New mystery? Like, the whole book?

70
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,742
They think the boy-in-the-river story line
is a bit soft.

71
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,577
They're looking for something darker.

72
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,412
They mentioned something about, say, um,

73
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,667
serial killers being
a potential fertile ground to explore.

74
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,837
Okay, um... I'll just have
to think about it.

75
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,508
Well, think fast
and have some pitches prepared.

-I figured you would have some ideas.
-Yeah, sure. No problem.

81

But don't you have firsthand experience
with an infamous serial killer?

No, I couldn't do that to Betty.

83

I gotta be honest with you, Arch.
I don't know about your uncle.

He's been trouble

As long as it doesn't
involve shallow graves and lye.

Who gets his name
because he guts his victims--

143

The idea of a serial killer is intriguing,

144
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,755
but what we've heard so far feels a bit...

145

146
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,594
Okay.

147
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,222
What about a serial killer
that uses social media

148
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,765
in order to stalk his prey?

149
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,937
Forsythe's best work stems
from his personal experiences.

150
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,107
Might I suggest you start there.

151
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,704
What about a dark and ominous force
that threatens the town of Seaport?

152
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,166
An obsessed killer who is looking
to expose the hypocrisy

153
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,459
and sins of his neighbors?

154
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,796
The Baxter Brothers discover
that the man unleashing his righteous rage

155
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,634
is the father
of Bobby Baxter's girlfriend, Tracy True.

156
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,385
This sounds promising.

157

158
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,141
{\an8}Uh, the Brown Hood.

I can come up

-with another--
-No. We like this.

161
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:47,151

this sounds like a million-dollar idea.

They're a bit of a mess.

{\an8}Your dad never missed a year.

171
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,518
{\an8}We'll bounce back, Mr. Keller,
we just need more time.

172
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,313
{\an8}You gotta remember, at this point,
Fred is three sheets to the wind, okay?

173
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,359
{\an8}And he somehow convinced himself
that stealing Seaside's mascot

174
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,737
{\an8}would give Riverdale the edge
in the playoff game, okay?

175
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,906
{\an8}So, he climbs over this big fence, right?

176
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,326
{\an8}And he goes to grab Peter the Pig
out of his pen, and get this:

177
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,287
{\an8}He can't climb back out.

178
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,373
{\an8}-[men laughing]
-He is absolutely trapped.

179
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,753
{\an8}So, the next morning, security shows up,
and there's Fred,

180
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,632
{\an8}all curled up in the mud,
holding on to the squealing hog.

181
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,051
{\an8}And without missing a beat,
my brother says:

182
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,138
{\an8}"I got the bacon, you got the eggs?"

183

{\an8}[all laughing]

184
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,984
{\an8}Your old man sure knew how to pick a crew.
Reminds me of the guys I served with.

185
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,196
{\an8}Mr. Keller says the guys were upset
they didn't get their bonuses this year.

186
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,657
{\an8}You are so much like your dad,

187
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,784
{\an8}always worried about other people.

188
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,287
{\an8}Relax. We got this.

189
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:27,960
For you.

190
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,005
{\an8}<i>Mija,</i> how very generous.

191
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,717
{\an8}But do I need to remind you that I own
the patent on this rum?

192
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,472
{\an8}Correction, Daddy. You own the patent
on sad, tired molasses-based rum.

193
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,641
{\an8}Ours is maple-based.

194
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,353
{\an8}And in a preemptive move to rum-block you,
we had a scientist analyze it.

195
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,730
{\an8}According to him, by making
the main ingredient maple syrup,

196
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,191
{\an8}our rum's DNA has changed by 51 percent.

197
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:53,402
{\an8}[Veronica] Which means, legally,
you can't sue or stop us.

198
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,489
{\an8}And should you be inspired to create
your own version of our invention,

199
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,199
{\an8}consider yourself forewarned

200
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,785
{\an8}because we control the patent
on maple rum.

201
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,203
So, toodles.

202
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:07,500
{\an8}In other words, Daddy,
our rum war... is back on.

203
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,510
{\an8}Your instincts were right again, Betty.
As requested, I did some digging on Bret.

204
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,387
[Betty] And what'd you find?

205
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,861
-Betty. What's up?
-I am so on to you, Bret.

206
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:40,408
God, you just think you're so untouchable
and that everyone is beneath you.

207
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,619
But the truth is,
you are a filthy cheater.

208
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,789
Whoa, Betty. Hang on for a minute.
What's going on?

209
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,544
Your roommate's father paid someone
to take the PSATs for him.

210
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,213
Oh, but don't worry,
his father covered it all up

211
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:58,342
and then bought his way into Stonewall,
as I'm sure he did with Yale as well.

212
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:03,222
Because the truth is, you haven't earned
a single thing in your life, Bret.

213
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,100
You're just a pathetic rich kid.

214
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,481
Why are you making me out
to be the villain here?

215
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,444
It's not like I'm
the one writing YA fiction

216
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,155
based off the exploits
of your deranged father.

217
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,076
Is that what your novel is about?

218
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,706
Betty, wait. Betty!

219
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:36,672
[Veronica] Cheryl, I've been musing.
We now have a truly enviable product.

220
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,884
But we still need to get the word out
to potential customers, so...

221
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,721
what if we make La Bonne Nuit
our base of operations?

222
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:47,057
Query. Didn't your daddykins revoke
this place's liquor license?

223
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,145
We wouldn't sell rum.
We would hand out free samples.

224
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,814
And instead of being a speakeasy,

225
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,942
we'd reopen La Bonne Nuit as a dance club.

226
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,612
Interesting.

227
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,198
Sweaty people equals thirsty people

228
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,700
equals people desperate
for overpriced mocktails.

229
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:08,037
Meanwhile, we covertly hand out samples
of our delicious homemade rum.

230
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,372
Our coat-check girl could take down
the names

231
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,166
and orders of potential customers,

232
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,543
and the legitimate money
we bring in at the club

233
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,379
could help fund our shadow operation.

It was that they didn't want to accept
the daughter of the Black Hood.

299
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,274
They were afraid
that if your father's identity got out,

00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,241
What's the problem, Mr. Keller?

508
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,910
Two hundred bucks missing from petty cash.
You know anything about that, Frank?

509
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,788
Yeah. I borrowed it against my salary.

510
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,123
You mean you stole it.

511
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,583
Can't steal something
when your family name's on the shingle.

512
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,962
Your brother put up that sign, Frank.
It had nothing to do with you.

513
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,880
Archie, I've done my best to help you,

514
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,300
but if you're gonna stand beside a piece
of garbage like this, we're finished.

515
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,010
Uncle Frank!

516
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,846
Mr. Keller!

517
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,862
That's it! I'm done.

518
00:28:58,945 --> 00:28:59,904
I quit.

519
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,241
Any of you wanna work a job
where you actually get paid,

520
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,784
you know where to find me.

521
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,255
Just gonna keep giving me
the silent treatment?

522
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,009
I stuck my neck out for you, Frank.
How the hell could you steal?

523
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,596
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it against my future salary.

524
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,390
-Why didn't you just come to me?
-Because you're my nephew!

525
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,809
I'm a 40-year-old man, Archie.

526
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,687
I did eight years in the military,
seven of that in combat.

527
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:37,066
How the hell do you think it makes me feel
to have to ask a teenager for a loan?

528
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,278
What did you even need it for?

529
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,072
I got a hot tip.
A sure thing at the track.

530
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,991
You're gambling with it?

531
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,496
I was trying to earn enough
to pay the guys their bonuses.

532
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,708
But go ahead and think the worst.
Everybody else does.

533
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,878
[door opens, then closes]

534
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,634
-[woman] We're on in five.
-[man 1] One, two. One, two.

535
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,010
[man 2] Lower that light!

536
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,305
-[man 3] Sound check, please.
-[man 2] Camera one, over here, please.

537
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,849
[speaking indistinctly]

538
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,810
[man 2] Can you stand still for a sec?

539
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,773
-[Jughead] Betty.
-[Betty] Yeah.

540
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,819
This is Mr. Brooks, the Yale recruiter
I was telling you about.

541
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,739
Recruiter. It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

542
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,199
The pleasure is mine.

543
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,160
Forsythe was insistent
I see you in action.

544
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,412
He's your biggest cheerleader.

545
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,747
And I'm his, too.

546
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,708
-Okay, break a leg out there.
-Okay, thanks.

547
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,876
[Betty] Nice to meet you.

548
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,963
[man] We'll be ready to start...

549
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:40,880
-Betty.
-Hey.

550
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,507
Jughead told me about the recruiter.

551
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,884
If you win out there,
you get another shot?

552
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,136
Yep, as if I wasn't already
stressed enough.

553
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,514
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I'm just really excited for you.

554
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,058
I left you a present in the green room.

555
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,882
Oh, my God, Mom. What did you do?

556
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:33,641
Well, hello, everyone,
and welcome to our RIVW's <i>Quiz Show.</i>

557
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,977
We have our returning champions
Stonewall Prep

558
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,355
facing first-time finalists
Riverdale High.

559
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:43,401
So, let's get quizzing.

560
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,905
What country has the longest coastline
in continental Europe?

561
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,406
-[buzzing]
-Norway.

562
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,116
-Correct.
-[buzzing]

563
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,660
-The Miracle of Dunkirk.
-Correct.

564
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,580
-[buzzing]
-Aft, bow, port, starboard.

565
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:56,915
Correct.

566
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:57,874
[buzzing]

567
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,501
If the limit never approaches anything,
the limit does not exist.

568
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:05,965
Correct. In his 1899 novella
<i>The Jungle Book, </i>what author--?

569
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,051
-Rudyard Kipling.
-Correct.

570
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,219
-Demand--
-Demand-side economics.

571
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,596
Why are we even here?

572
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,724
It's like she knows the answers
before the questions are even asked.

573
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,309
-[buzzing]
-Burgundy, France.

574
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,519
Ooh! Sorry, that's incorrect.

575
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,730
-[mouthing] I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

576
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:21,981
[host] To Stonewall.

577
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,568
-Côtes du Rhône.
-Sorry, that's also incorrect.

578
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,570
It's Bordeaux, you jack-hole.

579
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:31,282
-Actually, Bret, it's Alsace.
-The correct answer is Alsace.

580
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:35,578
Well, with a thrilling back and forth,
the score is still tied at 520.

581
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,288
[dramatic music plays over speakers]

582
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:41,709
Well, that sound can only mean one thing,
it is time for our final question.

583
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,380
It's all yours, B.
Destroy that pleated-khaki trash monster.

584
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,428
For the win.

585
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,056
In a manual transmission vehicle,

586
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:59,686
what mechanical device connects
two or more rotating shafts?

587
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,772
Spark plug.

588
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,150
That is incorrect.

589
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,861
[all sighing]

590
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,532
Riverdale, your chance to steal.

591
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,036
The clutch.

592
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,998
That is correct.

593
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,165
[bell dinging]

594
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,251
Riverdale has won.

595
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,294
-Riverdale are the winners.
-Oh, my God!

596
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,589
[host] There you have it, everyone.

597
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,175
Another fantastic <i>Quiz Show.</i>
Thanks for joining in.

598
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,760
[Alice] Say "Victory."

599
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,262
[all] Victory!

600
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,014
-[camera clicks]
-Okay, it's cute.

601
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,810
I'll take
Genius Girlfriends for 200, Alex.

602
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,814
I don't know what's better,
the win or the look on Bret's face.

603
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:47,275
We are gonna solve every mystery
in Connecticut,

604
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,402
-and we're gonna eat a lot of pizza.
-[Betty giggles]

605
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,076
[Alice] It looks perfect there.

606
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,455
And I'm so glad to see
that you're not beating yourself up.

607
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,914
You did what you had to do.

608
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,838
Yeah, not in the way that you think, Mom.
I didn't use the answers that you stole.

609
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,549
I tore those up and threw them away.

610
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,177
I wanted to beat Bret fair and square.

611
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,315
I take it the bet came in.

612
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,319
Yeah. Turned 200 into 10 grand.
It's enough to pay the bonuses.

613
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,112
We good now?

614
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,950
This is great, Uncle Frank.

615
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,578
But, no, we're not good.

616
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,207
When you took that money, it felt
like you were stealing from my dad.

617
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,710
I was just trying to help, Archie.

618
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,421
It's not what you did.
It's how you did it.

619
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,008
Andrews Construction isn't just
a business, it's my dad's legacy.

620
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,052
We treat it with honor, with respect.

621
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,012
This can't happen again.

622
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,557
You sound just like him.

623
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,810
And I understand.

624
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:15,279
[all chanting] <i>Betty, Betty, Betty!</i>

625
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,658
[whooping]

626
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,669
We did it, Mr. Honey. We won.

627
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,587
You did, Miss Cooper.

628
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:35,508
And, apparently,
how you did it is a grave problem.

629
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,469
I don't understand. What are you...?

630
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,599
This was found in the trash
inside your green room.

631
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,061
My office.

632
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,479
Now!

633
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,282
[door closes]

634
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,665
The school called.

635
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,209
I tried convincing Mr. Honey
that you had nothing to do with it,

636
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:14,130
that this was my doing to try to give you
an advantage to balance

637
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,007
-the damage your father has done.
-I know, Mom.

638
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,887
Why aren't you at work?

639
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,057
Apparently, somebody told
my station manager.

640
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:29,145
And I have been put on leave
without pay for who-knows-how-long.

641
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,273
I just don't understand.
How could anyone find out?

642
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,817
I mean, where's the evidence?
I was so careful.

643
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,902
Exhibit A.

644
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,654
Someone must have dug through my trash.

645
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,364
Probably Bret.

646
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:44,243
-But you didn't even use these answers.
-Doesn't matter. No one believes me.

647
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,162
I saw how hard you studied, Betty.

648
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,580
You earned that trophy.

649
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,707
Well, according to Mr. Honey,

650
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,252
Riverdale's victory has been tainted
by a cloud of scandal.

651
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,172
So, it's been overturned.

652
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,965
And Stonewall Prep wins again.

653
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,219
And I've been suspended
pending further investigation.

654
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,515
[school bell ringing]

655
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:11,395
Before I say what I'm about to say,
I wanna make one thing clear.

656
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,858
This is not about me wanting
to get back together. Understand?

657
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,069
I've heard better opening lines.

658
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,654
[Kevin] I have a proposal for you.

659
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,324
It's good money. On-camera work.

660
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,742
It's a little weird,

661
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,245
but will be infinitely less weird
if I do it with someone I know.

662
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,537
On camera.

663
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:34,001
-What are you talking about, Kevin?
-Just promise me you'll keep an open mind.

664
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,878
Okay? Stud.

665
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,717
Thanks for meeting me, Mr. Keller.

666
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:45,721
I wanted to make sure you got your bonus
and... to apologize.

667
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,224
I'm a grown man, Archie,
I can take care of myself.

668
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,978
Would you consider coming back
to Andrews Construction?

669
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,980
You know that I want to.

670
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,525
But if Frank's sticking around,
I just don't think that's a good idea.

671
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,027
What if I made you foreman?

672
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,823
Archie, you're a good kid.

673
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,701
You always have been.
But you trust too much.

674
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,869
I know who my Uncle Frank is, Mr. Keller.

675
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,790
Sure, he's a mixed bag.
I can't turn my back on family.

676
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,251
I understand that.

677
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,921
Good luck to you.

678
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,383
I just pray that Frank Andrews isn't
the end of your dad's company.

679
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,719
Thank you.

680
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:32,560
One maple rum punch and one maple-jito

681
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,687
-for Mr. Arklight and his guest.
-[woman] Thanks.

682
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,691
-How's the front of house going?
-Busy.

683
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,860
Word is spreading faster than a fire
at Thornhill.

684
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,487
-Hmm.
-[cell phone buzzing]

685
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,742
It's Pop Tate. Apparently,
La Bonne Nuit just got raided again.

686
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,037
Heavens, whatever will
your father find this time?

687
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,954
Let me think,

688
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,708
a club of sweaty, dancing teenagers
imbibing virgin coladas,

689
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:59,587
fizzy juice drinks
and coffee-infused colas.

690
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:04,216
To our two income streams
being up and running.

691
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,343
I'll drink to that.

692
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,512
[Penelope] Is this mask
absolutely necessary?

693
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,433
It's mandatory, Mother.

694
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,102
Unless you want someone
to find out your identity,

695
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,356
you'll keep that false face on and stay
within the walls of the Maple Club.

696
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,107
And if you get the itch to run...

697
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,152
That ankle monitor
and proximity sensor I put on you

698
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:26,989
will start screeching like a cat in heat,
Mrs. Blossom.

699
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,407
Take this as a win.

700
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,452
You're under house arrest,
minding our shop whilst we're in school.

701
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,705
But at least you're not in that petri dish
of a teen sex bunker.

702
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,249
[Penelope scoffs]

703
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,253
You're a pathological lunatic.
You know that, Bret?

704
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,381
-I know what you did to Betty.
-Easy, Forsythe.

705
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,049
From what I hear, she did it to herself.

706
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,219
You consider yourself
to be this elite man of honor,

707
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,763
but you are nothing more than a joke
and a coward.

708
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:54,225
When you say things like that, Forsythe,
it really upsets me.

709
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,728
Oh, I'm sorry.
Have I besmirched your precious honor?

710
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,438
-You're damn right you have.
-Good.

711
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,024
Because as stated
by the Quill and Skull charter,

712
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,318
any dispute between two members
can be solved

713
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,905
according to the code
of the society of the founding fathers.

714
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,490
A duel.

715
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,993
-You can't be serious.
-Oh, I am as serious

716
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,954
as a shot to the heart.

717
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,915
Um...

718
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:18,916
Are you scared?

719
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:23,504
No. Amused... at the thought
of your pony-tailed girlfriend

720
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,298
-weeping over your dead body.
-That's not gonna happen.

721
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,261
So, sudden death? Yes or no?

722
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,638
{\an8}[bell jingles]

723
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,309
-Hey.
-Hi.

724
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,019
I got here as soon as I could.
What's going on?

725
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,231
I just don't think
I can do this anymore, Arch.

726
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,569
I keep waiting for Jug to come back,
but he doesn't and he won't.

727
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,112
He won't ever come back.

728
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,406
[oldies music playing over speakers]

729
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,950
And I don't know how I'm supposed
to keep going.

730
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:01,083
Day by day, Betty.
We'll get through this, together.
