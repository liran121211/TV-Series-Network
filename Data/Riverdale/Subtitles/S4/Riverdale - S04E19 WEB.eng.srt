00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:17,142
[Jughead] <i>Forget art imitating life.</i>
<i>Here we had a case of art imitating death.</i>

2
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:20,979
<i>A snuff film that showed Jason Blossom</i>
<i>being murdered by dear old Dad,</i>

3
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,565
-[gunshot]
-<i>and a bizarre recreation of it.</i>

4
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,654
Months of static shots of houses,
now this. Why change the pattern?

5
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:35,326
Our voyeur is trying to recreate himself
into an auteur.

6
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,998
No longer satisfied with merely
documenting our daily lives, it seems.

7
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,792
Between this tape
and the one of Betty killing me,

8
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,379
it seems like he's trying
to painstakingly recreate our deaths.

9
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,630
Or near-deaths.

10
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,467
He's trying to blur the line
between fact and fiction.

11
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,343
Is it a warning?

12
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,305
-Could be a rehearsal.
-For what?

13
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,098
An actual murder.

14
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,642
So, our auteur got a copy
of the Jason Blossom murder video,

15
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,563
and then pulls a Gus Van Sant
and tries to remake it?

16
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,565
Where did he get the original video?

17
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,275
Blue Velvet Video.

18
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,986
Is there anything else we can do
at this point?

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,947
Wait for another tape.
Keep going through the videos

20
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,408
that we confiscated
from the Scarlet Suite.

21
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,869
I'm gonna have
to let you two fellas handle that

22
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,705
because I have to finish proofing
the yearbook tonight.

23
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,041
That's the most high school thing
you've ever said.

24
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,544
[Betty sighs]

25
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,254
Here it is, Mr. Honey.

26
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,049
Riverdale High's yearbook, as requested.

27
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,426
{\an8}There will be no yearbook this year,
Miss Cooper.

28
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,387
Sorry, what? Why?

29
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,807
The deadline for the printers
was two days ago.

30
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,685
Yes, but I called the printers,
and they said

31
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,314
if we get it to them this afternoon,
the yearbooks will be ready by graduation.

32
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:50,235
Yes, but I told you
that I would need to approve every page.

33
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,446
And I will not be able to do that
by this afternoon.

34
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,991
I pulled all-nighters to get this done.

35
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:01,121
And because I'm two days late,
you're punishing all of my classmates?

36
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,706
-How is that fair?
-I'm sorry, Miss Cooper...

37
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,209
but my decision is final.

38
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,766
[cell phone ringing]

39
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,857
-Hello?
-[woman] <i>Is this Forsythe Pendleton Jones?</i>

40
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,568
-Depends who's asking.
<i>-My name is Deena Lunham.</i>

41
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,696
<i>I'm the admissions coordinator</i>
<i>at the University of Iowa.</i>

42
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,781
<i>Do you have a moment</i>
<i>to talk about your application?</i>

43
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,242
Breaking news, everybody.

44
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,328
So, the University of Iowa has one of
the best writing programs in the country.

45
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,663
I applied for spring,

46
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,666
but then they told me
they could take me as early as fall.

47
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,251
You're a good writer, bro.

48
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,878
Wait.

49
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,754
So, this acceptance is conditional?

50
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:56,092
Yeah. They require additional materials,
which means I need another story.

51
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,803
But this could be my redemption
after that Stonewall hell.

52
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:03,016
The only problem is, the well
of my creative unconscious is tapped out.

53
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,227
Well, you could write a monster story
about Mr. Honey.

54
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,649
-I am proud of you though, Jug.
-What did he do?

55
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,987
Honey is refusing to publish the yearbook.

56
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,573
Our legacy,

57
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,242
the written record of our last four years,

58
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,872
our friendships, our loves, clubs, dances.

59
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,751
Bee, if it's about money,
I'm happy to help pay for the printing.

60
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,296
Thank you, Vee.
But it's the principle of it.

61
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,841
Mr. Honey has been on our case
since day one.

62
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,637
Do you remember when he threatened us
on our first day back?

63
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,014
And how many of us are already banned
from going to prom?

64
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,267
Fangs, Reggie, Toni and I are all banned
because of Ticklegate.

65
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,438
And I'm out because
of that bogus quiz show cheating scandal.

66
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,191
Lest we not forget
my transcendent rendition of "Cherry Bomb"

67
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,986
which got Veronica, the Vixens and myself
barred from the promenade.

68
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,073
So, literally the only people going
to prom are...

69
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,161
-You wanna go to prom with me, Jug?
-I'd be honored. But I'm not putting out.

70
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,579
Let the fan fiction begin.

71
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,581
Cousin Betty, I share your outrage.

72
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,167
Something must be done
to stop this heinous villain.

73
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,420
Like what? Every time we make
a move against him, he hits us back.

74
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,632
He's not letting Archie walk
with the rest of us at graduation.

75
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,967
He's a fiend.

76
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,553
Although one thing
that would stop Mr. Honey...

77
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,056
is if we killed him.

78
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,024
Or scared him enough to leave town.

79
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,151
I mean, it would be so easy.

80
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,989
<i>Mr. Honey works late on Tuesdays.</i>
<i>He usually leaves around 9.</i>

81
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,956
-[record scratches]
-Wouldn't he recognize us?

82
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,459
Good point, Arch. Okay, let's say,

83
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,796
we wear bunny masks
and Stonewall Prep jackets.

84
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,051
[Archie] <i>I could sneak up</i>
<i>and knock him out, take him down.</i>

85
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,849
[Betty] Then we'd tie him up
and stuff him into the trunk of a car.

86
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,146
What do you say, Reggie?
Can we borrow Bella for this?

87
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,273
After the way Honey trashed her
on Halloween night?

88
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,567
[Reggie] Bella! [gasps]

89
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,027
What happened to my car?

90
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,196
Such a shame when someone disrespects
your property, isn't it?

91
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:23,781
Hell, yeah.

92
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,201
[Archie] <i>Now where do we take him?</i>

93
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,455
My family still owns that cabin
in Fox Forest.

94
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,751
[Betty] <i>Then we take him there.</i>
<i>And make him think he's gonna die.</i>

95
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,794
[Cheryl] <i>And I know just the way</i>
<i>we can do that.</i>

96
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,589
Veronica?

97
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,675
Do you remember when we maple-boarded
my monster of a Mumzie?

98
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,347
[coughing]

99
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,683
We're letting you go.

100
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,853
But you're leaving town tonight.

101
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,856
And if you don't, we'll keep doing this.

102
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,025
And we won't stop until you're dead.

103
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,735
You're insane.

104
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,780
Fine. More syrup please.
Someone start digging his grave.

105
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,323
No, no, no. I'll leave. I'll leave!

106
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,205
At least that's one way
we could get our revenge.

107
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,167
Well, we could do that. For sure.

108
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:22,173
Or we could pull off
a classic senior prank,

109
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,885
the likes of which
will never be forgotten.

110
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,517
And I've got just the one for Mr. Honey.

111
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,145
It's an oldie... but a goodie.

You barred me and all of my Vixens
from prom.

You locked Miss Appleyard in her office.

191

You will be punished, of course.

205
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,108
Absolutely not.

to prepare these students
to be upstanding citizens of the world,

318

00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,163
[Honey chuckles]

336
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,417
Well, I am sorry,
but my decision is final.

337
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,170
Actually, it's not.
As president of the PTA,

338
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,089
I have a right to demand a vote
on this matter.

339
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,136
Perhaps if all of us,
say, over the age of 20,

340
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,973
would like to adjourn to my office,
we might discuss this as adults.

341
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,433
Yes, let's do that.

342
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,852
And as student body president,
I'll be joining.

343
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,145
[Honey] Fine.

344
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,773
<i>♪ Are you ready, are you ready</i>
<i>Are you ready ♪</i>

345
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,360
[Jughead] <i>And so the dragon that had been</i>
<i>terrorizing the halls of Riverdale High</i>

346
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,654
<i>was beaten, vanquished.</i>

347
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,867
<i>All that remained was giving it</i>
<i>a proper burial.</i>

348
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,578
Hurry up. It's almost dawn.

349
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,207
How deep does this grave have to be?

350
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,250
Deep. It's Riverdale.

351
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:21,220
What's shocking is, how many times have
we said these very words in real life?

352
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,971
I know, isn't it chilling?

353
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,933
Hobo. Bride of Hobo.

354
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,435
As student body president,
I have an announcement to make.

355
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:32,064
Although, I believe this proclamation
calls for a more festive setting.

356
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,611
[indistinct chatter]

357
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,199
[clears throat]

358
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,451
Classmates,

359
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,620
mothers, fathers,

360
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:47,829
Nana...

361
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,041
prom is officially back on!

362
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,377
[all cheering]

363
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,675
So, I'd like to propose a toast.

364
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,677
To generations united.

365
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,304
Together, we have proven victorious.

366
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,139
To all of us...

367
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,934
and to a senior prom we will never forget.

368
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,436
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

369
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,232
-And if I may speak for the grown-ups...
-[FP] Yep.

370
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,653
We're just so very, very proud of you

371
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,448
and the thoughtful, intelligent
young adults you've become.

372
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,325
You kids have been through a lot,

373
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,787
much more than we did
when we were at Riverdale High.

374
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,788
[Alice and Mary laugh]

375
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,458
And we may not say it enough,
but you mean the world to us.

376
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,794
And although it may not always
seem like it,

377
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,796
we have your best interests at heart.

378
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,632
You worked hard. You deserve to celebrate.

379
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,594
My boy is gonna be the first Jones man
to go to college!

380
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,180
-[whoops]
-[all cheering]

381
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,356
[Jughead] <i>They were supposed</i>
<i>to feel relief.</i>

382
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,900
<i>Honey was dead and buried.</i>

383
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,154
<i>And they'd gotten away with it.</i>
<i>They were free.</i>

384
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:07,492
<i>Free to go back to talking about college</i>
<i>and homework and prom.</i>

385
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,619
So, in terms of a theme for prom,

386
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,956
I was thinking old Hollywood.

387
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,000
I was going
to suggest F. Scott Fitzgerald,

388
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,586
<i>The Beautiful and the Damned.</i>

389
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,047
-But old Hollywood glamor works as well.
-[Betty] Mm.

390
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,009
-How many limos should we get?
-How can you talk about prom and limos

391
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,969
after what we did last night?

392
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,388
Hey, Reggie. Shut the hell up right now.

393
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,682
All I'm saying is,
last night was majorly messed up.

394
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,600
Reg.

395
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,770
Guys, I was just in the front office
and I saw Miss Bell talking to the police.

396
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,605
What? What were they talking about?

397
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,774
You know
how Principal Honey's gone missing?

398
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,693
Well, some Adventure Scouts
were camping in the woods,

399
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,529
found a pair of glasses
that might belong to Mr. Honey.

400
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,032
So, now the police
are suspecting foul play.

401
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,451
They're canceling class,
sending out a search party.

402
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,744
Should we go sign up?

403
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,590
This is a great complication, Jug.

404
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,508
-You think so?
-Mm-hm.

405
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,220
You don't think the Adventure Scout
finding the glasses is too contrived?

406
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,389
Guys, I was in the office just now.
Mr. Honey asked me to find you.

407
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,183
Said he wanted to see you ASAP.

408
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,268
That's weird.

409
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,772
Charles.

410
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,190
Mr. Honey.

411
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,650
What's up, Chuck?

412
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,487
Well, a videotape was delivered
to the school this morning.

413
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,448
And I called Agent Smith,

414
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,244
and he told me that the two of you
have been helping him with his case.

415
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,664
I thought you might wanna see this.

416
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,043
Be warned, it's extremely unsettling.

417
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,633
Now, it's just the school's facade
at first.

418
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,760
But then...

419
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,183
How long does this go on for?

420
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,101
[Honey] Hours.

421
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,021
Whoever shot this video covered
every inch of the school,

422
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,523
every hallway, every classroom.

423
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:05,318
The gym, the auditorium, the locker rooms.
But what could it possibly mean?

424
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,196
Because it feels like a...

425
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,326
I don't know, a warning or a threat.
Wouldn't you agree, Agent Smith?

426
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,247
That's one way to interpret it. Yes.

427
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,836
Well, in that case...

428
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,425
it seems I have no other option
but to put the school on high alert.

429
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,178
And despite the PTA's wishes, cancel prom.

430
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:36,224
If this tape even suggests the possibility
of violence against any of my students,

431
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,643
every precaution must be taken,

432
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,021
including curbing
extracurricular activities.

433
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:46,026
Will you let your friends know
while I alert your parents?

434
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,029
Mm-hm.

435
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,792
-This feels very wrong.
-Completely agree.

436
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,879
We know that our guy has moved on from
simple recordings and on to recreations.

437
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,464
This tape feels like he's backtracking.

438
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,342
-I mean, unless he's revisiting themes.
-[Jughead] Or it could be a hoax.

439
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,802
Think about it.
The general public does not know

440
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,847
our voyeur-slash-auteur has moved on
to recreations, right?

441
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,474
-Correct.
-I'm following you, Jughead.

442
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,601
So, if someone wanted to pretend
to be our auteur

443
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,978
and they didn't have
the privileged information that we do,

444
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,482
they would have shot a video
exactly like the one Mr. Honey was sent.

445
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,026
It's not a coincidence.
Honey wants to cancel prom,

446
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,904
he's conveniently sent a video
that gives him the perfect excuse?

447
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,572
Guys, unless we have conclusive proof

448
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,034
that this videotape was made
by someone other than our original guy,

449
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,869
Honey's well within his rights
to cancel prom.

450
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,997
-Can we borrow a copy of Honey's tape?
-Sure. Why?

451
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,041
-So, we can review every second of it.
-[Betty] No.

452
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:46,544
You have a story to write.
I will watch the damn tape. Let's go.

453
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,755
[Jughead] <i>And then, without warning,</i>

454
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,800
<i>their carefully constructed plan began</i>
<i>to unravel,</i>

455
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,718
<i>thanks to a guilt-ridden Reggie.</i>

456
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,804
Hey. You know what I heard about Honey?

457
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,848
I heard he was hooking up with a student
and got run out of town.

458
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,060
Who cares? The guy was a total perv.
Gave me the creeps.

459
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,021
[Reggie] What are you saying?
What are you saying?

460
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,107
That you're glad that he's dead?

461
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,067
Reggie, shut the hell up.

462
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,944
No. That's not what we're saying.

463
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,196
Look, all I'm saying is,
the guy was a total weirdo.

464
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,573
If he ran off, who cares? Good riddance.

465
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,867
He didn't run off.

466
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,289
They found his glasses.

467
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,250
-[Jimmy] What's your point?
-Dude. Reggie, I'm serious.

468
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,626
Just that...

469
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,878
they found his glasses,

470
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,172
but Honey will never be found 'cause he--

471
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,633
Shut up. Shut up.

472
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,137
You don't know what you're talking about.

473
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,446
I'm ordering Chinese. You want lo mein?

474
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,741
Yep. And some fried wontons, please.

475
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,825
Chicken or veggie?

476
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,161
Oh, hell, no.

477
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,708
Charles.

478
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,926
I think we got him.

479
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:21,973
[door opens]

480
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,100
Agent Smith.

481
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,186
Miss Cooper, Mr. Jones.

482
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,145
May I help you?

483
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,314
Yes, you can tell us
whether or not this is you

484
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,816
in the screen grab
from the video you received.

485
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,986
[Jughead] Is it you holding the camera
in that photo?

486
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,115
I mean, it's only two frames,
but it's enough to nail your ass.

487
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,285
If you're suggesting
that I'm sending videotapes around town--

488
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,204
No, not all the tapes. Just this one.

489
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:48,124
You're a copycat, Mr. Honey,
and not a very good one.

490
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,211
Using the voyeur's MO
to ramp up your personal feud

491
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,796
against me and my friends?

492
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:53,838
Feud?

493
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,050
I've been trying to protect you.

494
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,970
The only person we need protection from
is you, Mr. Honey. You're deranged.

495
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,557
I was trying to help you.

496
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,311
To prepare you for a life
outside of Riverdale.

497
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,063
You can justify your actions all you want,

498
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,191
but we already sent copies of the videos
to the school board, aka our parents,

499
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:17,195
so between them and the FBI,
I hope you have a good lawyer.

500
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,407
Guess that's checkmate, Mr. Honey.

501
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,118
Don't mess with us in our own town.

502
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,914
What causes a principal
to hate his students so much?

503
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:32,210
Was he bullied in high school?
Is his entire career based on revenge?

504
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,754
Well, maybe he should have had sessions
with Mrs. Burble

505
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,423
along with the rest of us.

506
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,719
At least now you can finish your story
without any real-life interruptions.

507
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,220
How close are you to being done?

508
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,180
Oh, I'm close. Reggie just died.

509
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,308
Reggie? Why did Reggie have to die?

510
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,235
[Cheryl sobbing]

511
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,920
It's not right.
Reggie didn't deserve that.

512
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,506
Of course he didn't deserve it, Cheryl.

513
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,217
You need to get ahold of yourself.
Do you understand me?

514
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,763
It's very sad, tragic even,
what happened to Reggie,

515
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,264
but he was out of control.

516
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,725
He couldn't handle himself
when Mr. Honey died.

517
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,144
Died? Are you serious?

518
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,771
Jughead's right, Cheryl.

519
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:36,232
Reggie was spiraling. He was drinking.

520
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,401
Tell her, Arch.

521
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,695
Yeah. If I hadn't been
in the locker room that time,

522
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,572
I don't know what he would have said.

523
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,200
Fine, but did we have to cut his brakes?

524
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,744
I mean, we murdered our friend.

525
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,704
What are you talking about, Vee?

526
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,709
We didn't cut Reggie's brakes.

527
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,921
His death was an accident.

528
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,426
The truth is,
he was never taking care of that car

529
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,677
the way he should have.

530
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,930
Eventually, it just caught up with him.

531
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,807
We can't change what happened.

532
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,893
The only thing we can do is live
our lives.

Ronnie, two people are dead right now.

536
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,026
Dead.

537
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,737
And right now, the world thinks
that Reggie died from a car accident.

538
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,364
A horrible car accident.

539
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,407
So, this ends.

540
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,743
Right now.

541
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,495
If we all just stick together...

542
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,457
-Will you do that for me?
-My God.

543
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,378
I knew Betty and Jughead had
a dark streak,

544
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,005
but when did you become
such a monster, Archiekins?

545
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,509
[snickers] Come on.
Don't kid yourself, Veronica.

546
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,304
In this town, we're all monsters.
We've always been monsters,

547
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,848
and that includes you, too.

548
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,849
The question is,

549
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,226
are we going to be monsters in college?

550
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,770
Or in jail?

551
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,195
Wow.

552
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,906
So, we're the monsters.

553
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,076
I kind of just go wherever
the story leads me.

554
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:14,080
But don't worry, I'm gonna change
all of our names before I submit it.

555
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:18,459
So, no one is going to know
the perverted truth about us...

556
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,086
but us.

557
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:25,550
So, what happens next?
Do Veronica and Cheryl go to the police?

558
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,887
Or does your teen-angst body count
increase by two?

559
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,096
I honestly don't know yet.

560

I'm still trying to decide
between some cautionary morality tale

561

and a nihilistic dark comedy.

562

I'll go get my keys.

674
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,513
What's that for?

675
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,058
Looks like a makeshift screen.

676
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,106
This projector reminds me of the ones
we used to have at the drive-in.

677
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,733
There's no film in it though.

678
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,282
Jug.

679
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,102
[Honey] <i>Dear Headmaster Koontz,</i>
<i>greetings from Riverdale High.</i>

680
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,189
<i>I wanted to follow up on our conversation</i>
<i>with a short note.</i>

681
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:47,027
<i>Though Jughead Jones has had</i>
<i>an incredibly difficult year, as you know,</i>

682
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:52,324
<i>and I've only interacted with him</i>
<i>a scant few times, he is a special kid</i>

683
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,285
<i>and he is a superb writer.</i>

684
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:55,995
<i>But he needs a break,</i>

685
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,498
<i>he needs good teachers</i>
<i>and a healthy environment,</i>

686
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,543
<i>which I know</i>
<i>the University of Iowa can provide.</i>

687
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,587
<i>Now, I don't say this lightly,</i>

688
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:09,967
<i>but I do believe Jughead Jones will be</i>
<i>an important voice of his generation.</i>

689
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:14,305
<i>If you'd like to discuss him further,</i>
<i>please call me at any time.</i>

690
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,432
<i>All my best to you and Edith.</i>

691
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,977
<i>Sincerely, Holden Honey.</i>
