1
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:01,304
<i>Previosly, on</i>
"Riverdale"...

2
00:00:01,392 --> 00:00:03,203
I'm Charles, your brother.

3
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:05,953
Hey, your days
of exploiting kids

4
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:07,539
to do your dirty work
ends tonight.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,625
Didn't we say we were gonna turn this
place into a community center, Red?

6
00:00:10,712 --> 00:00:13,134
Jughead?
Are you my roommate?

7
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:15,150
So much for a new start.

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,205
What... what is this?

9
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:31,501
Fast-forward.

10
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:42,392
It's literally six hours...

11
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:44,111
of our house.

12
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:47,814
Why would somebody do that?

13
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:50,548
Film it, and then leave the
evidence on the front doorstep?

14
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:52,009
To unsettle you.

15
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,999
Let you know
you're being watched.

16
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:56,071
Yeah, 
but why a videotape?

17
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:57,978
Why something so anachronistic?

18
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,712
Maybe it's just a prank.

19
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:01,376
If it was...

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,314
it was an elaborate one.

21
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:05,534
Over the next few days,

22
00:01:05,622 --> 00:01:06,501
then weeks,

23
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:08,650
more and more
citizens of Riverdale

24
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:11,251
received copies
of similar tapes,

25
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:13,534
footage of their houses

26
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:15,994
being watched
from across the street,

27
00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:18,298
for hours

28
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:20,751
upon hours.

29
00:01:22,146 --> 00:01:24,665
No messages were included
with the videos,

30
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:27,101
which somehow
made the whole thing

31
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:28,962
even more disturbing,

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,681
so that by Halloween,
the entire town was on edge.

33
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:35,631
Who would get the next tape?

34
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:36,883
What did they mean?

35
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,407
Were they a warning?

36
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:39,726
A test?

37
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:41,095
Another one?

38
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,720
Keep me updated.

39
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:45,224
The Muggses also got a tape.

40
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:46,525
Ooh! I'll get over there

41
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:49,392
and get an interview with him
for tonight's broadcast.

42
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:52,033
That's the fringe benefit
of living with the Sheriff.

43
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:54,786
I get the inside scoop
before any other reporter.

44
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,862
- Mmm-hmm?
- Mmm-hmm.

45
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,281
Hey, Betty, is Jug still
coming home for Halloween?

46
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,679
Yeah, that's the plan,
Mr. Jones.

47
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:04,751
We're going to
hand out candy and watch scary movies.

48
00:02:05,498 --> 00:02:06,570
Oh!

49
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:07,797
Why don't you invite
your brother?

50
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:09,531
Half-brother.

51
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:11,452
Charles doesn't know
anybody in town.

52
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,305
Okay, well, why is he
still in town?

53
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:16,033
He's helping me with the tapes
and a couple of other cases.

54
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:18,495
It's the one good thing that
came out of this nightmare.

55
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,633
Brought the entire
family together.

56
00:02:20,728 --> 00:02:22,056
Except for Jughead,

57
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:24,134
who's at Stonewall Prep.

58
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,290
And Polly, who's in a
facility being de-programmed.

59
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:29,150
I think...

60
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:30,837
it's time, Cheryl.

61
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,087
Time? Time for what?

62
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:34,759
To say goodbye to Jason.

63
00:02:36,252 --> 00:02:38,587
You've been promising me
for weeks.

64
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:40,602
I know,

65
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,361
and I'm going to.

66
00:02:43,353 --> 00:02:45,184
But I can't do it
before Halloween.

67
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:46,413
It's our favorite holiday.

68
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:49,603
Babe, then you're going to say
the same thing about Thanksgiving.

69
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:51,806
And then Christmas.

70
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,861
You're not going to
let this go, are you?

71
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,056
Okay, fine.

72
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:01,931
We'll rebury him on the Blossom family
plot on the grounds of Thornhill.

73
00:03:02,827 --> 00:03:04,450
But I'm warning you...

74
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,337
he's not going to like this.

75
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,454
I'll get the shovels.

76
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:22,540
Moose, why do you have this?

77
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:26,468
Oh, just thinking maybe
I'm done with high school.

78
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:28,251
I mean, I'm 18.

79
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:30,487
The army doesn't care who
you are or where you're from.

80
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:32,489
Dude, what Bret did,

81
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:33,871
spreading that article
about you,

82
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,892
was a real scumbag move.

83
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,301
But you can't let him win.

84
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:38,861
He wants you to leave.

85
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:40,819
Hell, he wants
both of us to leave.

86
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:42,739
Let's not give him
that satisfaction, okay?

87
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:44,241
It's easy for you to say, Jug.

88
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,197
They're not calling you
"Gargoyle Boy."

89
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,408
Hey! You and you,

90
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:11,329
I made it very clear

91
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,642
that there will be no costumes
on school property.

92
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:15,527
Now take off the masks.
Come on.

93
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:16,613
Hand it over.

94
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:17,907
Class.

95
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:19,117
Bee...

96
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:20,298
you okay?

97
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:22,050
Um, I'm not going to lie,

98
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:24,197
I'm a little on edge
this Halloween.

99
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,244
I mean, people are dressed up
like the Black Hood

100
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,923
and the Gargoyle King...

101
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:31,197
And there are
those damn videotapes.

102
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:32,556
I'm with you, girl.

103
00:04:32,644 --> 00:04:34,308
Ever since my dad
broke into the Pembrooke,

104
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,173
I've been looking
over my shoulder.

105
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:37,855
And if the town's got
a voyeur now...

106
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:39,142
What's up, guys?

107
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:43,556
Who wants to TP Mr. Honey's
office with me tomorrow night?

108
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,884
Reggie, It's senior year.

109
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:48,427
We're seniors.

110
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:49,637
Exactly.

111
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:51,392
It's senior year.

112
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,273
This is our last Halloween
at Riverdale High.

113
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,845
- I'm in, Reggie.
- Huh? - What? Kev.

114
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:56,962
Why?

115
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,282
Honey gave me
a week's detention

116
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:00,235
for going to the bathroom
without a hall pass.

117
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:02,026
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Mmm-hmm.

118
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:03,444
Yo, Red.

119
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:05,446
I just got
some distressing news.

120
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:07,197
You remember that crew that
was working out of the arcade?

121
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:08,699
Dodger and his boys?

122
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:11,025
He's still pissed that
he got beat up and jumped by...

123
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:14,283
that, uh, vigilante.

124
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:17,952
They're planning on wilding
Halloween night,

125
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,384
looking to bust some heads.

126
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:21,859
Damn it. The kids in the
neighborhood will be sitting ducks.

127
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:23,023
We got to do something.

128
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:24,673
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

129
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,051
Maybe keeping the center
open later than usual.

130
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:29,803
Why don't you guys host a Halloween
party at the community center?

131
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,139
That'll keep the kids off the
streets and out of harm's way.

132
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:33,726
And don't worry about costumes.

133
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:35,893
One of my gal pals
in New York, Katy Keen,

134
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,945
she goes to the High School
of the Performing Arts

135
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:39,897
and is an amazing designer.

136
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:41,374
Let me see what she can
whip up for you two.

137
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:42,611
Yeah, sounds great.

138
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:45,749
What about you, Jughead?

139
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,988
Which of your
favorite horror writers

140
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:49,323
did you bring in to share?

141
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,736
I brought the collected works
of HP Lovecraft.

142
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:56,663
There is nothing scary
about Lovecraft.

143
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,150
Says the guy
that brought in "The Raven"?

144
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:03,504
My favorite Poe story
is "The Cask of Amontillado."

145
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,005
That's the one where the guy is

146
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:06,840
sealed behind a wall,
behind bricks,

147
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:09,259
and then is never seen
or heard from again.

148
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:12,238
And that would be a horrible way to
go, don't you think, Forsythe?

149
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:13,837
Just vanish.

150
00:06:14,226 --> 00:06:17,095
Like the Stonewall Four,
you mean?

151
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:20,072
I'm betting Forsythe could
make it the Stonewall Five.

152
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:22,158
We're overdue for a vanishing.

153
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:29,673
Who or what
are the Stonewall Four?

154
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:31,947
Four students,

155
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:33,700
all of whom went to this school,

156
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:35,392
all of whom

157
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:37,908
Disappeared without a trace.

158
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:39,681
All at the same time?

159
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:41,275
No.

160
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:43,679
Uh, over 30 years or so.

161
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,712
And they didn't
really go "missing."

162
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,533
They dropped out.

163
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:49,640
So what're you saying?

164
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:52,742
Stonewall Four
is an urban legend, Jughead.

165
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,009
It's campus lore, that's all.

166
00:06:58,395 --> 00:07:00,290
I'm so proud of you, babe.

167
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,382
You're the strongest person
that I know.

168
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,976
Well, it's not the first time
I've had to bury my brother,

169
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:07,484
but hopefully it's the last.

170
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:10,048
Well, it was
the right thing to do.

171
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:13,447
Cheryl, what's that?

172
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,290
Oh, no.

173
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,336
I was afraid of this.

174
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:21,564
Of what?

175
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:23,478
Jason's ghost.

176
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:26,634
I think he's mad at us
for what you made me do.

177
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,681
I know exactly
where this is going...

178
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:37,369
the trash.

179
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:50,486
What are you reading, Jones?

180
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:53,638
The Stonewall Sentinel.

181
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,297
Coffee?

182
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:56,408
It's fresh brewed.

183
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:58,337
Yeah, thanks.

184
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,806
Searching for something
in particular?

185
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:04,400
Like...

186
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:08,705
articles about
the Stonewall Four, perhaps?

187
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:09,945
How'd you guess?

188
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,423
You love a good mystery,
don't you?

189
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,291
I've already searched
through years of articles,

190
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:16,078
and so far there's nothing
about disappearing students.

191
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:19,150
My next stop is
the town newspaper office

192
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:20,994
and the police station.

193
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,181
Jones, are you okay?

194
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:27,373
Yeah, uh...

195
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,611
I think I...

196
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:32,962
I think I need some air.

197
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:36,228
No.

198
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:38,314
You need to lie down.

199
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:49,189
Say hello to
the Stonewall Four for us.

200
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,529
<font color=#FF00FF>*RIVERDALE (US)*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 04  Episode 14</font>

<font color=#FF00FF>*RIVERDALE (US)*</font>
Title :<font color=#FFc30f>"Chapter Sixty-One: Halloween"</font>

202
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,441
Okay, opening my eyes now.

203
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,144
We look ridiculous.

204
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:04,710
You look adorable,
both of you.

205
00:09:04,798 --> 00:09:05,905
What are our names again?

206
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,038
According to Katy,

207
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:09,117
you, Archie, are
Pureheart The Powerful,

208
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:11,084
and you, Munroe,
are The Shield.

209
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:12,226
Right on.

210
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:13,705
Uh, Veronica, you need a ride
to the center?

211
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:14,781
No, I'll take an Uber.

212
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:17,042
I still have to do
some cleanup over here.

213
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:19,603
But save a dance for me,
Pureheart, won't ya?

214
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:30,298
Why aren't you in a costume?

215
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:35,681
I am. I'm dressed
as Laurie Strode.

216
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:37,415
Who?

217
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:39,962
Halloween...

218
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:41,869
movie...

219
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,962
I got it.

220
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,626
Trick or treat!

221
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:02,220
You guys look great.

222
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:07,312
Have fun.

223
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

224
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:10,087
Yeah.

225
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:15,642
What time is Jughead
getting here?

226
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:18,765
Uh, I don't know.
I keep texting him.

227
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:22,119
Whatever. I'm going upstairs
Minecraft.

228
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,712
Okay.

229
00:10:30,452 --> 00:10:32,181
Happy Halloween to me.

230
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:38,268
Ow!

231
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:39,720
Ow.

232
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:44,806
Ouch.

233
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:47,761
What?

234
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,348
All right.

235
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,311
All right!

236
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:10,020
It's really funny.
Let me out now.

237
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:14,325
Hey!

238
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:17,454
All right, Bret.

239
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,942
I know you love Edgar Allen Poe.

240
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:21,674
But trying to prove

241
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:23,918
that the premature
burial is scary,

242
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:27,325
the joke is on you because I've
already survived way worse.

243
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:34,637
Hey!

244
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:38,668
All right, you sick preppy
bastard, let me out.

245
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,325
Let me out!

246
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,028
Ow!

247
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:47,121
Hey!

248
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,301
Hello?

249
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:23,465
Hello?

250
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:26,621
Jug? Is that you?

251
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:28,473
<i>No, Betty, it's me.</i>

252
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:31,973
Who is this?

253
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:33,949
<i>You know who this is.</i>

254
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:40,449
I don't know
what kind of sick joke

255
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:41,810
you think you're playing,

256
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:43,416
but the Black Hood is dead.

257
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:44,604
And I'm calling the police.

258
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:46,645
<i>Have you checked on
the children lately?</i>

259
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:01,476
Oh...

260
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:03,856
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

261
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:09,387
You know, I've been driving
straight the last 18 hours.

262
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:11,791
I could really use
a cup of coffee

263
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,239
and a home-cooked meal.

264
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:17,588
I'll be quick.

265
00:13:17,692 --> 00:13:20,043
I-I'm trying to get home
to my family by daybreak.

266
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:23,704
Take a seat.

267
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:24,937
I'll get you a menu.

268
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:26,176
Thank you.

269
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:54,705
Eddie...

270
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,002
What the hell?
What are you doing with that?

271
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,143
You know the rules,
you can't have a knife in here.

272
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:00,242
Hand it over.

273
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,250
- Can I get it back before I go?
- Maybe.

274
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:03,820
Red, we got trouble
at two o'clock.

275
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:05,281
Dodger and his crew
just came in.

276
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:06,885
Crap.

277
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:14,367
Hey, this is a private event.

278
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:16,929
Really?

279
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:19,507
'Cause the sign outside says
it's open to the public.

280
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:22,000
Not for you and
your crew, Dodger.

281
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:27,765
Do I know you?

282
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:31,648
Well, I know that one.

283
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:34,437
Eddie?

284
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:38,273
You didn't tell me you
were taking the night off.

285
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:39,678
Who's handling
business out there

286
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:41,508
while you're in here,
having a good time?

287
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:43,422
Time is money.
Come on, let's go.

288
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:44,756
He's not going
anywhere with you.

289
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,474
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do about
it, Captain Spandex?

290
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:49,374
I heard you got your ass
kicked not too long ago.

291
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:51,779
If you'd like a repeat,
I'll happily oblige.

292
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:53,648
Now, leave.

293
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,711
This is private property.

294
00:14:56,543 --> 00:14:58,062
Be seeing you boys.

295
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:04,500
You too, Eddie!

296
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:05,635
Keep moving.

297
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:09,015
So, what do you think,
Ms. Isley?

298
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:11,201
Are we ready
for any trick-or-treaters

299
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:12,373
that might come our way?

300
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:14,193
Oh, we're ready
for a lot of things

301
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,867
about now...
Ms. Quinn.

302
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:37,368
And cue the toxic twins.

303
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,728
They're being
fussier than usual.

304
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:41,384
It must be
the blood moon tonight.

305
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:43,399
Aren't they with Nana?

306
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:56,946
They're asleep.

307
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,889
Nana, where's the other
baby monitor?

308
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:03,556
I heard him crying.

309
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:05,837
Your brother.

310
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:07,985
In the chapel.

311
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:19,329
Okay,
that's not possible.

312
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:20,800
I threw that doll away!

313
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:22,149
I told you.

314
00:16:22,262 --> 00:16:24,093
It's Jay-Jay.

315
00:16:24,469 --> 00:16:26,923
He's angry.
And now he's haunting us.

316
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:29,182
Cheryl, are you messing with me?

317
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:31,837
On the ashes of Thornhill,
I swear I'm not.

318
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:36,882
But...

319
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,413
I do think we should have

320
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:40,860
a Halloween seance
to try to talk to Jason.

321
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:44,077
Cool. Can we
get outta here, now, Reggie?

322
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:45,837
Relax, dude.

323
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:47,200
We're good.

324
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:48,701
We're golden.

325
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:50,337
You saw the parking lot.

326
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:57,524
You, stay here.

327
00:16:57,761 --> 00:16:59,563
Kevin, come with me.

328
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:16,563
Jellybean?

329
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,680
Are you okay?

330
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,548
Got ya.

331
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:40,392
You should see your face.

332
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:44,462
Do not answer that.

333
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,791
Stay in here.
Lock this door.

334
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:52,851
Listen to me,
you sick son of a bitch.

335
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,242
- I don't know who you are...
- <i>Yes, you do.</i>

336
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,867
Yes, you do.

337
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:58,806
That's impossible.

338
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:00,775
I saw you, him...

339
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:02,640
I saw him die.

340
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,210
You saw what
I wanted you to see.

341
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:06,007
- Stop lying.
- Tell me, Betty, do you know

342
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:07,327
where this call is
coming from?

343
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:08,515
Leave me alone!

344
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:10,205
It's coming
from inside the house.

345
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,318
Charles.

346
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:32,822
What the hell
are you doing here?

347
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:34,429
I was just headed home,

348
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:36,648
I thought you guys
might want some pizza...

349
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:39,462
Wha... Is everything okay?

350
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,465
Here you go.

351
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:17,835
Right off the grill.

352
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,158
I really
appreciate it.

353
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:21,086
Hey, can I show you something?

354
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:23,360
It's my family.

355
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,242
My wife and my two little girls.

356
00:19:27,154 --> 00:19:28,641
Aww...

357
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,303
Aren't they angels?

358
00:19:30,391 --> 00:19:32,438
They are,
they're beautiful.

359
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:34,089
And very lucky to have a father

360
00:19:34,177 --> 00:19:36,266
who's willing to drive
through the night for them.

361
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:38,828
- I'm gonna get you a refill.
- Thank you.

362
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,279
So, someone pretending

363
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,438
to be the Black Hood
keeps prank-calling you?

364
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:46,742
Mmm-hmm.
On and off, all night.

365
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:50,508
You know, um...

366
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:53,602
I could help you trace the call.

367
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:56,709
Really? You can do that?

368
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,783
Yeah. Yeah. I've got a unit
in the back of my trunk,

369
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,071
and it would only take
a few minutes to set up.

370
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,477
What do you think?

371
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:06,039
Let's do it.

372
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:07,749
I've been reviewing
your records, Kevin.

373
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:09,875
You've had a rough year. Well...

374
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:12,094
rough couple of years.

375
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:14,149
Mmm.

376
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:17,927
You know, after everything
you've been through,

377
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:19,985
I can only imagine how

378
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,952
alone you must feel.

379
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,429
Friendless.

380
00:20:26,938 --> 00:20:28,192
Sometimes, yeah.

381
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,054
And it's that vulnerability
that Mr. Mantle exploited,

382
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,476
isn't it?

383
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:37,944
Ms. Burble tells me
your first choice

384
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:40,374
for college is NYU.

385
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,223
The theatre program.
It's a great school.

386
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:45,054
It could be
a fresh start for you.

387
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:48,952
Sadly, I doubt you'll get in.

388
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,155
Excuse me?

389
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:51,827
Hmm, well...

390
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:53,733
Not after
Carrie.

391
00:20:54,356 --> 00:20:55,827
Not after
Heathers.

392
00:20:56,795 --> 00:20:58,546
And not after tonight.

393
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:04,835
It was... It was Reggie's idea.

394
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:06,138
To... to trash your office.

395
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:08,630
I'm... I'm so sorry.

396
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:10,127
Okay, Mr. Honey?

397
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:11,804
No. It's very good, Kevin.

398
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,319
Very good.

399
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:14,819
That's all I needed to hear.

400
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:16,413
You can go now.

401
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:25,177
Talk to me, Eddie.

402
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:26,958
What's Dodger
got you doing for him?

403
00:21:27,046 --> 00:21:29,132
Running? Collecting?
Stealing hubcaps?

404
00:21:29,226 --> 00:21:30,231
What do you care?

405
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,271
I care because I don't want
you getting in trouble.

406
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,585
Or worse.

407
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,583
Yo, Red, you're gonna
wanna check this out.

408
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,256
- What?
- Some of the kids wanted to go home.

409
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:39,092
I went outside to make sure
everything was cool and...

410
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,185
And?

411
00:21:40,273 --> 00:21:41,481
There's trouble out front.

412
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:43,231
Hey, wait, can...
can I bounce?

413
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,962
Hell, no, you're staying here

414
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,311
until the party's over,
and then I'm walking you home.

415
00:21:51,405 --> 00:21:52,646
Hey!

416
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,803
I told you to get outta here.

417
00:21:55,365 --> 00:21:56,990
Nah, it doesn't work
that way.

418
00:21:57,178 --> 00:21:59,797
That crap gym of yours
might be private property,

419
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,904
but this lot isn't.

420
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:04,873
That's it, I'm done playing.

421
00:22:05,061 --> 00:22:06,537
Yeah, you do that, son!

422
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,881
Come here and get your ass shot.

423
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:13,475
That would make
our Halloween. Right, boys?

424
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,498
Come on. Come on.

425
00:22:22,223 --> 00:22:23,676
Mr. Jones, it's Archie.

426
00:22:23,764 --> 00:22:25,496
Can you do me a favor
and swing by the gym?

427
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:27,095
We got a bunch of kids here
and some punks

428
00:22:27,182 --> 00:22:28,642
with guns out front.
Let me know.

429
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:31,662
What do we do
in the meantime?

430
00:22:33,023 --> 00:22:35,303
We keep the party going,
as late as we have to.

431
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:38,395
I call upon
the invisible forces

432
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,989
all around us to aide
and guide us through

433
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:43,115
this communication
with the spirit world.

434
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:48,037
Is the entity
inside this doll present?

435
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:03,094
Okay, come on, Cheryl.
Stop moving it.

436
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,678
I would, T.T.,
except, I'm not.

437
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,904
I swear.

438
00:23:08,617 --> 00:23:11,436
Spirit, what is thy name?

439
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,855
I know you're upset

440
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:24,525
that I made you bury
your dead brother's corpse,

441
00:23:24,745 --> 00:23:25,981
but this is so messed up.

442
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:28,022
I already told you, it's not me.

443
00:23:28,217 --> 00:23:30,881
It's Jay-Jay's ghost self
trying to engage with us.

444
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:34,436
This is not Jason, Cheryl.

445
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:36,506
He's not moving this board.

446
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:38,772
Antoinette's right.

447
00:23:39,194 --> 00:23:41,725
It's not Jason...

448
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,373
it's Julian.

449
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,412
What do you mean, Nana?

450
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,474
Who is Julian?

451
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:50,851
Your mother

452
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:54,108
held three babies in her womb.

453
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:57,475
Julian was to be your triplet.

454
00:23:57,788 --> 00:24:01,217
But, in the end,
only you and Jason were born.

455
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:03,071
Because,

456
00:24:03,237 --> 00:24:05,998
as the midwife explained it,

457
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,686
you, Cheryl,

458
00:24:08,862 --> 00:24:11,756
had absorbed the third one.

459
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:15,514
Eaten it.

460
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,225
That... that can't
possibly be true.

461
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:23,951
Penelope was devastated.

462
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:26,811
So she procured this doll

463
00:24:27,023 --> 00:24:30,358
and reared it alongside
the two of you

464
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,944
until you were
no longer infants,

465
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:37,959
at which point Julian...

466
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:39,998
was retired...

467
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,787
to the attic.

468
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:45,822
So...

469
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,819
now that the doll's back,

470
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:49,613
the spirit of Julian

471
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:51,369
is haunting Thistlehouse?

472
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,623
What other explanation
could there possibly be?

473
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:56,100
That you and Nana Rose

474
00:24:56,188 --> 00:24:57,561
are working together.

475
00:24:57,649 --> 00:24:59,879
And to what end would
Nana and I be colluding?

476
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:01,348
I don't know, babe,

477
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:04,092
to make me realize that things
were better when Jason was here?

478
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,678
So we dig him back up and
park him at the kitchen table.

479
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:10,154
Back here in the chapel
would be acceptable.

480
00:25:14,453 --> 00:25:15,990
And if we...

481
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:17,556
did

482
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:19,240
bring Jason back home,

483
00:25:19,857 --> 00:25:22,105
would this haunting stop?

484
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,525
Could we get rid of this
creepy-ass doll once and for all

485
00:25:24,612 --> 00:25:26,514
and bury him in Jason's grave?

486
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,608
Yes, T.T.,
I agree to your terms.

487
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,029
You know,

488
00:25:34,202 --> 00:25:37,029
this persona that you've...

489
00:25:37,308 --> 00:25:38,865
cultivated, Mr. Mantle,

490
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:41,022
this... prankster,

491
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:42,920
this class clown,

492
00:25:43,052 --> 00:25:44,582
has made it impossible

493
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,502
for your peers and your teachers

494
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,358
to take you seriously.

495
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,757
Do you think
this has anything to do

496
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,326
with your father abusing you?

497
00:25:57,277 --> 00:25:58,373
What?

498
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:01,315
People won't notice
the bruises or the pain

499
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:03,524
if they're laughing
at one of your jokes.

500
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:05,053
Is that the thinking?

501
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:08,647
Because the thing is...

502
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:12,037
they're not laughing
with you, Mr. Mantle,

503
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:14,279
they're laughing at you.

504
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,553
Now, you consider that

505
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:20,690
as you clean up my office,

506
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:24,014
and you leave it exactly
as you found it.

507
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:30,009
We haven't talked much since

508
00:26:30,097 --> 00:26:32,104
everything went down
with the Farm.

509
00:26:33,285 --> 00:26:34,635
Haven't we?

510
00:26:36,105 --> 00:26:38,627
You have every right
to be wary of me.

511
00:26:40,404 --> 00:26:42,440
Starting with the fact
that you let Mom walk

512
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:44,588
right into the
lion's den with Edgar.

513
00:26:44,695 --> 00:26:46,026
Let the record show

514
00:26:46,113 --> 00:26:47,649
that when I reconnected
with Alice,

515
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:49,447
and she found out
I worked with the FBI,

516
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:51,266
she wanted to go undercover.

517
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:52,756
To help Polly,

518
00:26:52,953 --> 00:26:54,313
to get a story.

519
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:55,875
What about you?

520
00:26:57,585 --> 00:26:58,930
What do you want?

521
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:06,344
I guess I've, uh...

522
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:10,469
I've always wanted
to be part of a real family.

523
00:27:12,826 --> 00:27:15,649
But I know that that takes time.

524
00:27:18,163 --> 00:27:19,578
Um...

525
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,750
Just, um, keep him talking.

526
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,875
Okay.

527
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:28,052
Hello?

528
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,516
<i>Hello again, Betty.</i>

529
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,612
Who is this?

530
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,160
<i>Don't play dumb.</i>

531
00:27:33,497 --> 00:27:34,696
Sorry.

532
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:38,184
I just have been getting
a lot of prank calls

533
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:40,125
tonight pretending to be...

534
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:42,204
you.

535
00:27:42,305 --> 00:27:45,170
I mean, it is Halloween,
and I do live in the murder house. Right?

536
00:27:45,258 --> 00:27:46,420
<i>You're testing my patience.</i>

537
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:49,406
You remember Halloween,
don't you?

538
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,977
We used to go
trick-or-treating...

539
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,593
as a family.

540
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,297
You, me, Mom, Polly.

541
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:58,740
We'd walk up and down
Elm Street.

542
00:27:58,828 --> 00:28:00,555
<i>I remember.</i>

543
00:28:00,768 --> 00:28:03,684
And when we got home,
we would go through our bags of treats.

544
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:05,303
You didn't want us to eat apples

545
00:28:05,391 --> 00:28:08,336
because you thought there
might be razor blades in them.

546
00:28:08,696 --> 00:28:09,861
Which is...

547
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:13,274
pretty funny,
all things considered, huh?

548
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:16,344
- <i>Elizabeth.</i>
- Bye, you sicko.

549
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,813
Did you trace it? The number?

550
00:28:24,878 --> 00:28:26,328
Charles?

551
00:28:26,964 --> 00:28:28,383
What is it?

552
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:31,719
Where is the call coming from?

553
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:34,211
Um...

554
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:36,805
It's...

555
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:40,047
coming from Shady Grove
Treatment Center,

556
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:42,375
where your sister's
been staying.

557
00:28:44,178 --> 00:28:47,367
Polly has been prank-calling me?

558
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:49,172
Well,

559
00:28:49,297 --> 00:28:51,567
I'll call the main line
at Shady Grove and see

560
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:54,093
- how she got access to a phone.
- No, no, no. Wait.

561
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,203
I have a better idea.

562
00:28:58,802 --> 00:29:01,051
Shady
Grove, how may I assist you?

563
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,454
Hi, I was wondering
if I could speak

564
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,663
to one of your patients, please.

565
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,831
Name of patient?

566
00:29:04,918 --> 00:29:05,947
Polly Cooper.

567
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,579
Who may I ask is calling?

568
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:09,922
Edgar.

569
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,703
One moment, please.

570
00:29:15,345 --> 00:29:17,218
Edgar? Is it really you?

571
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:19,137
No, bitch, it's your sister.

572
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,097
What?

573
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:22,141
Edgar is worm food,

574
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:24,478
and you're as good as
dead to me now, too.

575
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:27,023
What? Betty, how could you
pretend to be Edgar?

576
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:29,305
How could you pretend
to be Dad?

577
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:31,774
- I... I...
- You are sick, Polly.

578
00:29:31,862 --> 00:29:33,188
Really truly.

579
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:42,869
So ends the Case
of the Mystery Prank Caller.

580
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:44,007
You know, I wish
that I could say

581
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:46,805
tonight's been particularly
insane because it's Halloween,

582
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:49,656
but no, this is actually
fairly typical.

583
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,598
I'm not usually on kitchen duty,

584
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:57,884
so I hope
the burger was all right.

585
00:29:57,971 --> 00:29:59,482
Oh, delicious.

586
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,425
Nothing like
a home-cooked meal.

587
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:03,610
We here at Pop's try.

588
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,990
Any room for dessert?
We have pumpkin pie, homemade.

589
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:09,998
Oh, well, well,
I will take a slice of that.

590
00:30:10,086 --> 00:30:11,623
- All right.
- Thank you.

591
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:20,688
<i>We have just
received breaking news.</i>

592
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:22,683
<i>An extremely dangerous patient</i>

593
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:25,779
<i>escaped Shady Grove Treatment
Center earlier today.</i>

594
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,606
<i>A serial killer nicknamed
"The Family Man,"</i>

595
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:30,105
<i>Michael Matthews,</i>

596
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:32,836
<i>forced his many victims
to cook him meals</i>

597
00:30:32,923 --> 00:30:34,880
<i>before brutally murdering them.</i>

598
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,591
<i>He is of average height
and medium build.</i>

599
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:39,551
<i>After escaping from Shady Grove,</i>

600
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:40,774
<i>he killed a trucker</i>

601
00:30:40,862 --> 00:30:44,112
<i>and stole his clothes
and vehicle.</i>

602
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:20,954
Locker rooms are secure.

603
00:32:21,057 --> 00:32:22,258
Check the bay doors next.

604
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:23,873
Mr. Jones?

605
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:25,460
Hey, Red, sorry
it's taken me a minute.

606
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:27,760
It's been a crazy night,
but I'm pulling up right now.

607
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:29,157
Okay, great.

608
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,079
Where's Eddie?

609
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:39,040
I'll check around back.

610
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:44,915
Hey!

611
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:48,446
Eddie?

612
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:50,323
- Eddie?
- I need an ambulance now,

613
00:32:50,411 --> 00:32:52,594
El Royale Boxing Club.
Right now!

614
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:56,540
You're okay, you're okay.

615
00:32:58,236 --> 00:32:59,984
Hey,
I've been thinking, um,

616
00:33:00,188 --> 00:33:02,002
given how well
you handled yourself

617
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,680
with the Farm, at the motel,

618
00:33:03,768 --> 00:33:05,413
I think you'd make
an excellent candidate

619
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:07,461
for the Junior
FBI Training Program.

620
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,336
An FBI program
for high schoolers?

621
00:33:12,522 --> 00:33:14,186
Is that actually a thing?

622
00:33:14,274 --> 00:33:15,993
- It is.
- Hmm.

623
00:33:16,937 --> 00:33:18,609
We could work together
trying to figure out

624
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,407
who's sending these videotapes.

625
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:23,774
You know this town
a whole lot better than I do.

626
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:26,329
That's true.

627
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:30,360
Will you consider it, at least?

628
00:33:43,643 --> 00:33:45,665
Looks good, Mr. Mantle.

629
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:49,015
So, can I go home?

630
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:50,711
I mean, it's already morning.

631
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,922
As long as we
understand each other,

632
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,485
we can walk
out of here together.

633
00:34:04,654 --> 00:34:05,919
What the hell?

634
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:08,297
Bella! Bella!

635
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:11,415
What happened to my car?

636
00:34:11,562 --> 00:34:15,071
It's such a shame when someone
disrespects your property, isn't it?

637
00:34:17,401 --> 00:34:19,149
Wonder who did this.

638
00:34:19,353 --> 00:34:21,454
Probably hooligans
having some...

639
00:34:22,002 --> 00:34:23,766
Halloween fun.

640
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,579
Would you like a ride,
Mr. Mantle?

641
00:34:27,755 --> 00:34:28,993
No.

642
00:34:29,282 --> 00:34:30,657
No, thank you.

643
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:32,930
Well...

644
00:34:33,965 --> 00:34:35,727
get home safe.

645
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:43,454
You're home now, Jay-Jay.

646
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:45,860
For good.

647
00:34:48,778 --> 00:34:50,649
All is right in the world.

648
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:52,882
Isn't it, my love?

649
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,234
Isn't it, my love?

650
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:56,376
Yep.

651
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:59,782
Everything's back to normal.

652
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:32,607
Hey! Hey!

653
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:35,086
Help! Help!

654
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,482
I'm trapped!

655
00:35:36,644 --> 00:35:38,646
Help me. Help!

656
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:48,912
Mr. Jones...

657
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:53,100
Good morning. I, uh...

658
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,240
I see you've been had.

659
00:35:58,148 --> 00:35:59,716
Mr. Chipping...

660
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:03,410
Where... Where...

661
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:05,527
I'm always amazed
at my students' antics.

662
00:36:05,615 --> 00:36:07,209
How they get extra...

663
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:08,984
creative at Halloween.

664
00:36:09,286 --> 00:36:10,599
Creative?

665
00:36:10,743 --> 00:36:13,412
Don't take it
personally, Jughead.

666
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:15,146
It's a...

667
00:36:15,354 --> 00:36:17,537
Stonewall Prep tradition.

668
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,748
It means you belong now.

669
00:36:21,861 --> 00:36:23,326
Belong to what?

670
00:36:23,678 --> 00:36:25,130
To us, of course.

671
00:36:25,793 --> 00:36:27,207
Here is your phone.

672
00:36:27,294 --> 00:36:29,838
You've got a lot of
missed texts and calls.

673
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:32,980
Did you know about this?

674
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:36,128
Absolutely not.

675
00:36:38,034 --> 00:36:39,355
What was even the point of this?

676
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:42,120
It was just a bit of
Halloween fun, that's all.

677
00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:44,331
What? Did we go too far?

678
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:48,666
In that case,
you could always...

679
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:50,620
just leave.

680
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,729
No.

681
00:36:54,698 --> 00:36:56,120
I'm good.

682
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,519
Happy Halloween, kids.

683
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:03,730
How you feelin', Eddie?

684
00:37:03,997 --> 00:37:05,831
Like I got shot in the leg.

685
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:09,753
Doctor said it was just
a flesh wound.

686
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:11,999
You got really lucky.

687
00:37:12,087 --> 00:37:13,902
Eddie, it could've been
a lot worse.

688
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,167
If Dodger and his crew did this,

689
00:37:16,255 --> 00:37:17,360
we can help you.

690
00:37:17,509 --> 00:37:18,945
Me, Munroe, Sheriff Jones.

691
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:20,355
Help how?

692
00:37:21,554 --> 00:37:22,718
The last thing I need

693
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,230
is for these guys
to think that I snitched,

694
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:28,189
especially since you
took away my switchblade.

695
00:37:28,277 --> 00:37:31,089
That's not gonna protect
you from guys like Dodger,

696
00:37:31,571 --> 00:37:32,902
but Munroe and I will.

697
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,280
Come hang with us at the center.

698
00:37:34,445 --> 00:37:35,942
They won't step foot
in there ever again.

699
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:38,236
And then what happens when
the center closes at 10:00?

700
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:39,941
Where do I go then?

701
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,628
I'm back out on the street
'cause I have to be.

702
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:44,542
A lot of us are.

703
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,659
I have two options...

704
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,003
either I roll with Dodger

705
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,480
or hide

706
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:54,011
from Dodger.

707
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:55,980
That's it.

708
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:02,745
I can't believe you held
that guy off on your own.

709
00:38:02,832 --> 00:38:04,073
I mean, I can.

710
00:38:04,941 --> 00:38:06,777
You know you're
a total badass, right?

711
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:10,620
I like to think so.

712
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:14,011
And how did Pureheart hold up?

713
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,277
Honestly...

714
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:22,628
I don't know what I'm doing.

715
00:38:24,014 --> 00:38:27,542
I vowed to create a safe space
for the kids in this town,

716
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:29,956
something my dad
could be proud of.

717
00:38:30,385 --> 00:38:31,534
It's never going to happen

718
00:38:31,622 --> 00:38:33,442
as long as guys like Dodger
are out on the streets.

719
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:35,753
Okay, so then
we clean up the streets.

720
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:48,792
Archie...

721
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,544
As well as you fill them out,
you're not actually considering

722
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:53,886
fighting crime
in those tights, are you?

723
00:38:54,091 --> 00:38:55,718
Of course not.

724
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:58,158
I'm going to need a mask.

725
00:38:58,387 --> 00:38:59,831
Cheryl?

726
00:39:00,183 --> 00:39:01,948
How was your shower, my love?

727
00:39:02,657 --> 00:39:04,448
Why was this sitting on the bed?

728
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:07,207
I thought we agreed
to put an end to this.

729
00:39:07,396 --> 00:39:08,569
Jason's back.

730
00:39:08,657 --> 00:39:10,097
You got what you wanted.

731
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,605
Although it pains me
to admit it...

732
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:19,665
Yes, I was
gaslighting you before.

733
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,205
And for that,
I apologize, but,

734
00:39:22,411 --> 00:39:24,675
I swear,
on Jason's life,

735
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:27,870
I have no idea
how that got back into this house.

736
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:29,720
Truly.

737
00:39:29,964 --> 00:39:32,438
Well, then,
how is this happening?

738
00:39:32,526 --> 00:39:33,909
I mean...

739
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:36,870
We for sure
buried this doll. Right?

740
00:39:37,528 --> 00:39:39,253
I told you...

741
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,956
It's Julian.

742
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:46,886
T.T.

743
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:51,613
I'm afraid the true haunting of
Thistlehouse has only just begun.

744
00:39:57,052 --> 00:39:59,878
Moose, you're not
going to believe what Bret...

745
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,058
I mean, it's like
Moose completely vanished.

746
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:11,153
There's not a trace of him
anywhere, Betty.

747
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,586
Well, is it possible
he actually joined the Army?

748
00:40:13,713 --> 00:40:15,152
I don't know.

749
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:17,003
I placed a couple calls,

750
00:40:17,091 --> 00:40:18,217
but...

751
00:40:18,386 --> 00:40:20,878
I know it was them
that chased him out of here.

752
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,642
I mean, did they
lock me in that coffin

753
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,981
because they wanted me
out of the way

754
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:26,269
while they terrorized Moose
into leaving?

755
00:40:30,156 --> 00:40:31,597
I don't know.

756
00:40:31,923 --> 00:40:33,763
I just hate that they
kept me from helping you.

757
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:35,746
I'm sorry that you had to
go through that alone.

758
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,636
Well, technically,
I wasn't alone.

759
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:40,925
I was with Charles.

760
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:42,417
Oh.

761
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,581
So are we warming up
to our half-brother now?

762
00:40:45,669 --> 00:40:47,052
I guess so.

763
00:40:48,873 --> 00:40:50,144
<i>Yeah. Kind of.</i>

764
00:40:50,232 --> 00:40:52,641
<i>He wants me to join
the Junior FBI,</i>

765
00:40:52,729 --> 00:40:54,207
<i>which, I don't know.</i>

766
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,127
<i>I might actually be good at.</i>

767
00:40:56,215 --> 00:40:58,683
<i>Yeah. I think
you would be great at it.</i>

768
00:40:59,473 --> 00:41:01,503
<i>I'm just glad that
Charles was there for you.</i>

769
00:41:02,103 --> 00:41:03,300
<i>Yeah.</i>

770
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:07,183
<i>He might be the real deal.</i>

771
00:41:08,296 --> 00:41:09,722
<i>Meanwhile, I feel guilty</i>

772
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,753
that I wasn't
there for you, Jug.

773
00:41:11,841 --> 00:41:12,921
No.

774
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:15,011
Well, actually,
you were there for me.

775
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,605
Thinking about you
was the only thing

776
00:41:16,692 --> 00:41:18,120
that kept me
from losing hope.

777
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:20,323
And my sanity.

778
00:41:21,424 --> 00:41:22,485
I think deep down,

779
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:23,947
I know that if I ever
really went missing,

780
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:25,581
that you would be the one
to find me.

781
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:27,267
<i>I would, Jug.</i>

782
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,415
<i>I promise.</i>

783
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:46,108
