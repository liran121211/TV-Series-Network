1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,377
Previously Riverdale...

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,004
Do you see those people
over there?

3
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:05,422
They're Dodger's family.

4
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:07,590
I'm not sure
what you're here for,

5
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,175
but you and your boys
need to leave.

6
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,177
We've got kids here,
we don't want any trouble.

7
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,680
Mr. DuPont, the first book
in the Baxter Brothers series,

8
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,515
was written by my grandfather.

9
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,891
I killed Caramel.

10
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:20,228
No, Betty, that wasn't you,

11
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,605
that was your deeply
screwed-up dad.

12
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,357
Someone is trying
to drive me mad.

13
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,444
But, once I find out
who this depraved monster is,

14
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,654
I will unleash a wrath
upon them so wicked,

15
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,282
they will wish they had been
consumed in their mother's womb.

16
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,200
You've reached
the Riverdale hotline.

17
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,537
If you wish to report a problem in
your neighborhood, leave a message.

18
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,206
Anonymity is your choice.
We're here to help.

19
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,378
"And as Buddy and Bobby Baxter sat
down at the dining room table,"

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,255
exhausted and bruised,

21
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,591
they felt satisfaction.

22
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,218
The Case of the Boy
in the River had been solved.

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,804
Tomorrow, there would be
another mystery.

24
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,141
But tonight, their only concern

25
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,309
"was dinner."

26
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,981
Outstanding, Mr. Jones.

27
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,318
I believe the Baxter Brothers has
found their newest ghostwriter.

28
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,904
Wait, I won the contract?

29
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,614
Like, right this second?

30
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,239
That is correct.

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,493
Professor DuPont,
you can't actually believe

32
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,411
that garbage was better
than my submission.

33
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,497
Oh, I can and I do.

34
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,958
Your contract, Mr. Jones.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,003
Your first step into
a larger, better life.

36
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,922
Provided you play by the rules.

37
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,599
I don't understand.
Dartmouth was my safety school.

38
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,602
I guess you should've
accepted Harvard's invitation.

39
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,271
Nice try, Daddy,

40
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,190
but I still have
my interview with Columbia.

41
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,359
Interview, huh?

42
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,736
Good luck with that.

43
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,656
Columbia's
extremely competitive.

44
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:58,535
But, I believe
Riverdale Community College

45
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,121
has a rolling admission policy.

46
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,290
So if you study there,
you could launch your rum empire.

47
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,459
If that's still happening.

48
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,211
Oh, it's happening, Daddy.

49
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,716
Hey, wake up, Red.

50
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,054
Mr. Jones? Ah!
What are you doing here?

51
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,640
Investigating a vigilante.

52
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,226
Now be honest with me.
Is that you?

53
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,812
Yeah, it is.

54
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,123
You're not gonna
arrest me, are you?

55
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,231
I should.

56
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,503
What the hell do you think
you're doing, huh?

57
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,403
Helping.

58
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:36,823
People are too scared to call you
or the cops, so I set up a hotline.

59
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,326
What happens if you get hurt?
Or worse?

60
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,329
People die changing tires on
the side of the road, Mr. Jones.

61
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,849
At least I'd die with
a shred of honor.

62
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,000
[SCOFFS] What a load of smug BS.

63
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,544
You think that's gonna
comfort your mom?

64
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,337
Why aren't you focused
on the center,

65
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,381
- protecting these kids?
- I am.

66
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,842
But trouble shows up here
about every other day,

67
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,720
starting with the Dickensons who
are still out there, by the way.

68
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,722
You're doing
good work here, Red.

69
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,057
Here. Honorable work.

70
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,519
Maybe I can help you.

71
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,372
[JUGHEAD] What do you say, Chuck.
Can you help me?

72
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,481
So you want me
to use FBI resources

73
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,275
to track down your...

74
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,402
Sorry, our grandfather.

75
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,154
Why the sudden urgency?

76
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:19,449
Well, look, it's probably something
I should have done months ago, but...

77
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,118
I have an important
decision to make.

78
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,287
And I can't until I know the truth.
His truth.

79
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,455
Can you help me?

80
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:27,790
What's wrong, Pop?

81
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,293
Our liquor license
has been revoked.

82
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,713
As of Sunday, the speakeasy won't
be allowed to serve alcohol.

83
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,256
What? According to whom?

84
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,716
The mayor's office.

85
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,718
Figures.

86
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,054
This is payback
for me vowing to challenge.

87
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,931
Daddy's precious rum empire.

88
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,808
Long-term,
we're fighting this injunction.

89
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,311
Short-term,

90
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,106
we're hosting
a no-holds barred blow-out

91
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,317
at La Bonne Nuit
before the boom falls.

92
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,612
No offense, Veronica,

93
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,657
but your father,
he wasn't raised right.

94
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,160
Actually,

95
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,788
he was.

96
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,791
And you've just given me
a great idea.

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,632
What? What's happening?

100
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,259
Honey, it's your sister.

101
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,010
She mutilated a nurse
at Shady Grove.

102
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,637
She almost clawed her face off.

103
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,641
[BETTY] Maybe this is a mistake.

104
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,852
Polly's messed up,
but she's not a literal monster.

This is security footage

from Shady Grove.

[BETTY SIGHS]

108
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,532
Okay, Polly is sitting there, looking
like a zombie, but she's not hurt...

109
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,958
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,461
What the hell happened?
She attacked that nurse for no reason.

111
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,255
She'll only talk to you,
she says.

112
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:58,506
And alone.

113
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,999
Okay. Well then
I'll go talk to her.

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,026
Okay. Well then
I'll go talk to her.

115
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,344
First, there's one more thing
you should know.

116
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,179
The nurse that Polly disfigured,

117
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,348
her name is Betty.

Betty. Oh, thank God.

You're the one I can trust.
Can you tell me what's going on?

Polly, can you tell me
what's going on?

122
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,656
You attacked
a nurse named Betty.

123
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,991
That's impossible.

124
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,328
I can't remember
any of what they're saying.

125
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,830
I was in the rec room,
and the next thing I remember,

126
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,999
I'm in here
and I'm chained to this bed.

You have to believe me,
Betty, please.

I didn't do this.

Please believe me.

131
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,634
I didn't do it, Betty.
I didn't do it, it wasn't me. [CRYING]

From Southside High

pretty good shape, Red.

refuses to teach me.

- From me.

It is my recipe that he's using.
