-[Kevin] The Farm left me.

00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,762
The worthy ascended.

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,598
-Where's my mom and Polly?
-Gone. Everyone is.

4
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,059
I'm Charles. Your brother.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,311
It's vital that we find your mom ASAP.

6
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,565
-Is there anything we can do to help?
-Thought you might ask.

7
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:24,774
Welcome home, Jay-Jay.

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,820
-We want your father, not you.
-Understood, Agent Ordelia.

9
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,239
-You're under arrest.
-For what?

10
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:34,451
For conducting illegal activities
at your establishments.

11
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,912
Hermione Lodge, you're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder.

12
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,039
Your own husband's.

13
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:42,000
This is what I got when I asked my dad
about that stupid game.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,461
Been thinking about making some changes
to this place.

15
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,130
-I want you to help me run it.
-Oh, yeah.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,966
[Archie] Fred Andrews will always be
a part of Riverdale.

17
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,009
I love you so much, Dad.

[Jughead] <i>After Mr. Andrews' funeral,</i>

19
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,807
<i>the rest of summer vacation passed</i>
<i>in a surreal haze.</i>

20
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,730
<i>Betty, Veronica and I spent as much time</i>
<i>as we could with Archie.</i>

21
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,565
<i>We had dinner at Pop's every night.</i>

22
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,985
<i>And every day, you could tell</i>
<i>he was getting better and better.</i>

23
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,200
<i>I'm not saying he wasn't still</i>
<i>heartbroken, the entire town was,</i>

24
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,202
<i>but my pal Archie's a fighter.</i>

25
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,329
<i>And by the last day of summer vacation,</i>

26
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,874
<i>while the football field was being mowed</i>
<i>for the new season</i>

27
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,294
<i>and the school floors</i>
<i>were being buffed to a shine</i>

28
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:30,048
<i>and banners for the first</i>
<i>dance of the year were being hung...</i>

29
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,884
<i>Archie was doing what he does best.</i>

30
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,012
You know, Mad Dog, I was thinking,
school starts tomorrow.

31
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,224
What if you came with me?

32
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:44,145
-Why would I do that?
-I don't know, to get your diploma.

33
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,105
Don't you want it?

34
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,110
-Hell, yeah.
-Okay, then this is your chance.

35
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,530
-Isn't your brother gonna be a freshman?
-I don't know.

36
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,698
After everything I've lived through,

37
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:59,035
I don't think going back to textbooks
and cafeteria politics is really my scene.

38
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,537
Yeah, it's not mine, either.

39
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,249
But getting that diploma
is what my dad wanted, so I'll do it.

40
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,501
Look, we could do it together.

41
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,796
-You could try out for the Bulldogs.
-Ooh. A little pigskin.

42
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,964
[both laugh]

43
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:11,881
-Really?
-Really.

44
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,842
[Betty] <i>So, Mom missed</i>
<i>another check-in with you?</i>

45
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,845
Yes. But like I said, don't panic.

46
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,180
This isn't the first time she's been late
with reports.

47
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,725
Well, Charles, what if that means
she's been found out?

48
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:27,105
Listen, until she contacts us, you should
just focus on being a high school student.

49
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,274
I'll reach out if anything changes.

50
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:35,196
Now that your parents' court date has
been set, you need to make a decision.

51
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:39,409
Are you testifying on behalf
of your mother or your father, or both?

52
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,535
Or neither.

53
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,495
I can be Switzerland.

54
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,959
At the very minimum, I recommend
you issue a statement of support.

55
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,088
-The press will want to know where you--
-No comment. That's my statement.

56
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,465
Now if you'll excuse me, Mr. Sowerberry,

57
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,510
I have some last-minute
school supply shopping I need to do.

58
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,723
Well, Jay-Jay,
which one for the first day of school?

59
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,561
Rebellious white after Labor Day
or my signature red?

60
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,231
I agree 100 percent.

61
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,902
[Betty] <i>I really can't imagine</i>
<i>a better way</i>

62
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,321
to spend our last night
of summer vacation.

63
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,697
Isn't it crazy?

64
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,576
In just nine months,
life as we know it will be over.

65
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,244
No more high school.

66
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,204
No more <i>Blue and Gold.</i>

67
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,625
No more heart-to-hearts at the lockers.

68
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,460
Oh, B. Don't be sad.

69
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,462
I'm sorry, guys.

70
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,798
I can't help but think,
life goes by so fast.

71
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,928
And none of us are very good
at stopping to savor it.

72
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,390
-But tonight we will be.
-Mm-hm.

73
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,480
I think that's our cue, Archiekins.

Get up. We're gonna be late.

88
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,060
-You guys! Wake up!
-[Jughead] Huh?

89
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,272
We're gonna be late for the first day
of senior year. Hurry up.

90
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,202
You're late.

91
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,582
-And you are?
-I'm Principal Weatherbee's replacement.

92
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,042
Mr. Honey.

93
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,172
We apologize for the tardiness, Mr. Honey.
It won't happen again.

94
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:44,093
I don't know what kind of a ship
Waldo Weatherbee was running around here.

95
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:48,514
Things are gonna be different this year.
We'll have order, discipline...

96
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,224
consequences.

97
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,019
Now, get out of my sight.

98
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,489
Okay.
He sets up the bubble screen for you.

99
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,325
You catch, bam. You run like hell.

100
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,119
-You're one of the fastest we've got.
-Coach.

101
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,081
Any chance we can make room
for one more Bulldog?

102
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,541
Our lineup's pretty much set.
Are you looking to play?

103
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,293
Definitely. If you'll have me on the team.

104
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,630
-So, what's your name?
-Munroe. Munroe Moore.

105
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,510
-Come to practice. Show us what you got.
-For sure. I'll be there.

106
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,595
This is gonna be the best season ever.

107
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,858
I'm not too late, am I? To sign up for...

108
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,861
I don't know,
I was thinking maybe an arts reporter.

109
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:44,987
Kevin.

110
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,739
Betty...

111
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,742
I'm also here because...

112
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,832
I've been doing a lot of work on myself
ever since I was left behind by the Farm

113
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,251
and it's helped me to realize
that I don't--

114
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,754
I don't need the Farm
to make me feel whole,

115
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:06,384
but I do need my friends,
especially my former best friend.

116
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:14,600
I am... so sorry for the way I treated you
while I was under Edgar's spell.

117
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:19,439
Oh, you mean like when you dragged me
by my ankles to get a lobotomy?

118
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,274
Yeah, I--

119
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,777
I'm most ashamed of that.

120
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,488
I hope that I can show you
how much I've changed

121
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,990
and I hope...

122
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,827
that I prove to you that you can--
You can trust me again.

123
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,748
I-- I'm so, so sorry, Betty.

124
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,504
Just fill out an application, Kev.

125
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,132
And then we'll see.

126

-No. In fact, you have a visitor.

130
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,401
I'm Mr. Chipping.
It's nice to meet you, Jughead.

131
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,569
Nice to meet you, too.

132
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:10,990
Over the summer, you submitted
a short story to a writing contest.

133
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,119
-[sighs] Yeah, I didn't win.
-Yeah, I know. I was one of the judges.

134
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,663
I was very impressed with your voice.

135
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,124
And while I couldn't sway
my fellow judges,

136
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:25,129
I can offer you an opportunity
to come study writing with me.

137
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,090
I am a teacher at Stonewall Prep.

138
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,218
You want me to transfer to Stonewall Prep?

139
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,262
-It's a tremendous offer, Mr. Jones.
-I'm good.

140
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,974

and for liking my story.

00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,675
{\an8}At the last student dance,
multiple students were murdered.

167
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:57,013
{\an8}Yes, but that's exactly
why we need this dance.

168
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,222
{\an8}To heal.

169
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,893
{\an8}Mr. Honey, if I may speak
from personal experience,

170
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,606
{\an8}the back-to-school dance,
after my brother Jason's death,

171
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,692
{\an8}provided much-needed catharsis.

172
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,944
{\an8}Well, I disagree.

173
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,035
{\an8}Now, I will only repeat myself once.

174
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,122
{\an8}There will be no back-to-school dance.

175
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,465
{\an8}[Archie] Huddle up, guys.
All right, Munroe,

176
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,216
{\an8}let's see if we can catch them napping.

177
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,635
-On one. Ready?
-[all] Break.

178
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:39,889
Watch your man!

179
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,393
Attaboy, Reggie! Don't give him
an ounce of daylight, all right?

180
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,895
{\an8}Come on, you hear me?

181
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,521
{\an8}Blue 34.

182
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,981
Blue 34.

183
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,775
Down, set. Hut!

184
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,823
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

185
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,700
[Marty] Come on!

186
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,078
-Whoo!
-[laughs]

187
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,001
Hey! Get over here!

188
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,087
{\an8}Now!

189
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,012
{\an8}Get over here. What are you doing?

190
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,515
{\an8}That guy just made you look
like a damn fool.

191
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,766
{\an8}He's fast.

192
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,601
{\an8}[Marty] It's unacceptable.

193
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,187
{\an8}That was an embarrassing display.

194
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:32,024
{\an8}Go out there. Come on, man!
Show me something!

195
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,327
{\an8}[camera flash clicks]

196
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,247
{\an8}What the hell?

197
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,043
{\an8}-Oh, you have gotta be kidding me!
-I was...

198
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,337
Vixens!

199
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,383
{\an8}This pervert was taking pictures of us
while we changed.

200
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,554
{\an8}Collecting photos for your sad
pubescent spank bank, are you?

201
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,764
{\an8}No. No.

202
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,017
{\an8}A reporter from Rumordale.com reached out

203
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,229
{\an8}and he told me he would pay 500 bucks
for a photo of Veronica.

204
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,358
{\an8}-How am I supposed to say no to that?
-You just say it, you worm.

205
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:23,576
-Nice job out there, Mad Dog.
-Thanks. It's Munroe actually.

206
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,619
Oh, my bad. I thought it was Mad Dog.

207
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,913
Or is that just what they called you
in jail?

208
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,628
It was juvie. And your boy Archie
was right there with me.

209
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,173
-Is there a problem, guys?
-No, bro. We're cool.

210
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,258
Let's settle a bet.

211
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,887
In prison showers, is it true
what they say about dropping the soap?

212
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,557
Hey, he's not worth it, dude. Trust me.

213
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:56,484
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-What do you think, Andrews?

214
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,652
I've been captain of the Bulldogs
since sophomore year.

215
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,156
I don't need some ex-con who showed up
last minute stealing my thunder.

216
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,618
I saw your dad giving you a hard time,
but man up, you're supposed to be captain.

217
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,709
-Hey.
-[FP] Hey.

218
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,921
Jug. You know Mr. Chipping.

219
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,298
He was telling me
about an offer that he made you.

220
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,468
Yeah. My answer still hasn't changed.

221
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,012
I'm sorry, but I can't go to your school.

222
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,265
If this is about money,
I got a few bucks socked away.

223
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,351
No, it's not just about money.

224
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,810
Boy, look me in the eye and tell me

225
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,105
you don't wanna go to a school
that recognizes your talent.

226
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,442
Jug, how about this?
How about you come take a tour,

227
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,195
see the place for yourself
and then make the decision?

228
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,698
-I-- No. I just don't wanna waste--
-You're taking the damn tour.

229
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,076
Have a seat.

230
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,165
[Betty] <i>Charles, I'm back.</i>

231
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,460
They ran out of fortune cookies,
if you can believe that.

232
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,129
Charles?

233
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,322
Wait, what?

234
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,495
Is this what you do when I'm not around,
Betty? You read classified information?

235
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,249
When were you gonna tell me
that you had Kevin under surveillance?

236
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:39,295
I wasn't. From the get-go, I suspected
Kevin hadn't fully cut ties with the Farm.

237
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,505
I started monitoring his phone activity

238
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,717
and it turns out he's been texting
with Fangs Fogarty.

239
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,935
I mean, I was hoping
that Kevin was done... with the Farm.

240
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,021
It seemed like he was done.

241
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,523
This might be a blessing in disguise.

242
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,817
We could use their relationship
to our advantage.

243
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,570
In his text,
Kevin keeps pushing to meet in person,

244
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,197
but Fangs has been holding him off,
saying he can't risk it

245
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,408
unless he has something useful
to offer in return.

246
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,120
So, what if we accidentally let slip--

247
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,916
Some fake intel about our investigation
in front of Kevin.

248
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,502
Exactly. Something that'll lure Fangs
out of hiding.

249
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,631
The first step is to develop Kevin
as an asset.

250
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,175
You think you can do that?

251
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,052
One hundred percent.

252
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:31,805
Cheryl?

253
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,609
You scared me.
What were you doing in there?

254
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,821
I was... praying.

255
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,740
Since when are you religious?

256
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,952
I was looking for some divine guidance
on how to handle this...

257
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,536
discord with Mr. Honey.

258
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:59,333
And the spirits didn't fail to deliver
a hellaciously simple idea.

259
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,252
Instead of throwing
a back-to-school dance,

260
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,838
we are hosting a back-to-school party...

261
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,841
right here at Thistlehouse.

262

-Hey, are you Forsythe?
-Yeah.

275
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,766
Bret Weston Wallis. Mr. Chipping
asked me to roll out the red carpet.

276
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,352
-You can just call me Jughead.
-I prefer Forsythe.

277
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,896
-Who's your friend?
-Betty Cooper.

278
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,816
Cute. Very <i>Sweet Valley High.</i>

279
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,985
Let me give you some stats.

280
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:13,657
Our faculty holds 132 masters degrees
and 28 doctoral degrees,

281
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,659
which sounds impressive, but the truth is

282
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,162
most of our teachers
are hopelessly out of touch.

283
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,789
Except for Mr. Chipping, he's cool.
And I'm not just saying that

284
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,459
because he's coming.
Mr. Chipping, how's it hanging?

285
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,087
Bret, don't let me interrupt you,
but I wanted to invite Jughead

286
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,839
to sit in on a salon with us.

287
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,717
If I'm not mistaken,
we're focusing on<i> Moby-Dick</i> tomorrow.

288
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,302
Great. That's one of my favorites.

289
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,721
-See you tomorrow, Mr. Jones.
-Definitely.

290
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,600
Betty, you can come, too. I bet
you've got a lot to say about <i>Moby-Dick.</i>

291
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,394
No. No, I don't.

292
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,398
And I think I've gotten my fill
of this place already, so...

293
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,778
It is a lot to digest.
Speaking of which, the cafeteria.

294
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,822
We've got vegan, keto vegan,
raw keto vegan...

295
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,497
I don't like drama, Miss Lodge.

296
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,000
Neither do I, Mr. Honey.

297
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:10,839
And yet there's this article Rumordale.com
published about you this morning

298
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,174
promising drama.

299
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,843
-I'm assuming you've read that.
-No.

300
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,430
I've been avoiding the tabloids
these past few months.

301
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,850
An unnamed inside source
that worked at your night club

302
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,229
is claiming that you, in fact,

303
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,982
are responsible for the crimes
that your father allegedly committed.

304
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,785
Fascinating.

305
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,663
Your point, Mr. Honey?

306
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:47,501
I was just wondering if you shouldn't
take a sabbatical from Riverdale High.

307
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,797
Until you can get all these
personal matters of yours... sorted.

308
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,930
[laughing]

309
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,724
Oh, man.
I have missed hanging out with you, Betty.

310
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,854
I was thinking back to freshman year.
You talked about crushing on Archie

311
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,607
and I would talk about
whatever weird Grind'em hookup I just had.

312
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,068
-Or not had.
-That I remember.

313
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,161
Kev, I think the reason
I was cold earlier...

314
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:30,377
I mean, as you know, my mom
and Polly are still at the Farm.

315
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,089
And my half-brother is investigating them.

316
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,800
-Yeah. Charles?
-Yeah.

317
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,636
-Right? Yeah.
-Anyways, today, finally...

318
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,431
there was a break in the case.

319
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,434
Really? What?

320
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,062
The FBI found a witness

321
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,274
who's willing to testify against the Farm.

322
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,695
Charles says it may finally
break open the case.

323
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,030
-Wow.
-Yeah.

324
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,615
That is...

325
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:02,993
Cheers.

326
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,794
Kevin.

327
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,339
[laughs] Fangs. Hey.

328
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:22,054
Can I at least hug you?
I miss you so much.

329
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,555
I've missed you, too.

330
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,601
But first, you said

00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:10,183
Kev, I need you to ask Fangs
to meet with you again

500
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,560
so he can tell you where Edgar is hiding.

501
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,938
-He won't.
-He will if you have information

502
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:15,855
to give him.

503
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,859

who doesn't actually exist, by the way,

504
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,111

505

-Like Penelope Blossom.

I'll take him home, Mr. Jones.

What are the charges, Sheriff Jones,
if one might ask?

00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,013
Someone called the station
about the noise.

What do you want me to say, huh?

533
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,130
That my dad hits me?

534
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,092
That he beats the crap out of me

I'm sorry, Reg. I really am.

537

I was always so jealous
of the relationship you had with your dad.

538
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,526
No matter what you wanted to do,
he always stuck by you.

542
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,250
what if it had been my old man instead?

543
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,470
So, what can we do? Or what can I do?

544
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,347
You've already done enough, man.

545
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,182
You called him out.

Now it's on me.

You could talk to him.

00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,043
Stonewall's not too far
and I'll be back every weekend.

669
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:07,214
Hey. I'm glad you accepted
Chipping's offer.

670
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,801
-You're sort of a legacy there, you know?
-What do you mean?

671
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,595
Well, your grandpa, Forsythe I,

672
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,972
actually went to Stonewall Prep
for a couple of months

673
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,307
till he dropped out.

674
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,517
What happened?
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

675
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,188
Well, it's ancient history.
But he quit at everything, including me.

676
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,231
Went out for a pack of smokes
and never came back.

677
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:29,278
Anyway, I didn't mention it
because I wanted this to be your decision

678
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,947
without my old man's shadow
hanging over you.

679
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,742
It's a chance for you
to do something good... for yourself.

680
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,160
And I'm proud of you, son.

681
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,164
It's gonna be a good year,
a really good year.

682
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,043
{\an8}[dogs barking]

683
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,544
{\an8}-Jughead!
-[all] Jughead!

684
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,421
-[FP] Jug!
-[all] Jughead!

685
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,465
-Jug!
-Jug!

686
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,509
-Jughead!
-Jughead!

687
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,135
Jughead, where are you, man?

688
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,303
[all] Jughead!

689
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,430
[all yelling]

690
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,765
Jug! Jughead!
