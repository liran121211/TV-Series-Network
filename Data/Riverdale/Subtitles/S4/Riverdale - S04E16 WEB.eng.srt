00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,094
[Jughead] <i>The weirdest thing</i>
<i>about pretending to be dead is</i>

2
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,431
<i>that after a while, you actually start</i>
<i>feeling like you're dead.</i>

3
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,308
<i>As in "dead as a doornail" dead.</i>

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,020
[beeps]

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,940
<i>For starters, I was underground,</i>
<i>as if in a tomb.</i>

6
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,110
<i>Granted, I was hiding out</i>
<i>in Dilton's doomsday bunker</i>

7
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,029
<i>and not in a coffin, but still.</i>

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,615
<i>Two weeks, no sunlight,</i>

9
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,035
<i>with no sense of time or its passing.</i>

10
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,912
<i>It's gotta be what Limbo</i>
<i>feels like, right?</i>

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,874
<i>Other similarities to being dead:</i>

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>Not one, but two obituaries about me ran.</i>

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,882
<i>A rather perfunctory one</i>
<i>in </i>The Riverdale Register.

14
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,510
<i>A second, more irreverent one</i>
<i>in </i>The Blue and Gold.

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,345
<i>I liked that one.</i>

16
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,724
<i>And a funeral.</i>

17
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,142
<i>Well, a wake.</i>

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,145
<i>I watched it on my laptop.</i>

19
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,357
<i>Live-streamed from a camera</i>
<i>Betty had set up in the living room.</i>

20
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,115
<i>Betty and I suspected</i>
<i>the Stonies would show up.</i>

21
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,242
<i>And sure enough, they did.</i>

22
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,912
<i>We wanted to study them,</i>

23
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,164
<i>to see if anything they did</i>
<i>was suspicious.</i>

24
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,250
<i>Not that there was any doubt</i>
<i>in our mind about their guilt.</i>

25
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,171
<i>The preppies had stone-cold murdered me</i>
<i>and were trying to pin it on Betty.</i>

26
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,298
<i>We just couldn't prove it.</i>

27
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,008
<i>Not yet.</i>

28
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,929
<i>Meanwhile, the hardest part</i>
<i>of playing dead</i>

29
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,808
<i>was letting everyone believe</i>
<i>I was in the semisweet hereafter.</i>

30
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,310
<i>Our family, our friends.</i>

31
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,938
<i>The lies we had to tell,</i>

32
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,941
<i>the things we had to do</i>
<i>to sell that illusion.</i>

33
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,860
<i>Like pretending that my bereft girlfriend</i>
<i>had found comfort</i>

34
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,404
<i>in the strong, steely arms of my best bud.</i>

35
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,534
<i>Which turned out to be</i>
<i>the greatest misdirect of them all.</i>

36
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,870
<i>Of course, we needed</i>
<i>to let some people know the truth.</i>

37
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,872
<i>Except in one case.</i>

38
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,083
<i>My kid sister, Jellybean?</i>

39
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,085
<i>Didn't have to be told.</i>

40
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,796
Oh, you found the fake blood.
Thanks, Jellybean.

41
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,965
Do you need it for Jughead?

42
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,343
What? What do you--? What do you mean?

43
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,845
Do you need it to help my brother?

44
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,767
Jellybean, do you know where Jughead is?

45
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,395
I heard you whispering on the phone
to Charles last night.

46
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,813
The walls are super thin.

47
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,233
You don't have to tell me where he is,
just that he's okay.

48
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,111
Is he... okay?

49
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,824
-Can you keep a secret?
-[knocking on door]

50
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,868
[Jughead] <i>We brought my dad into it</i>
<i>pretty quick, too.</i>

51
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,785
Hey, Betty.

52
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,787
I, uh...

53
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,540
I gave that bloody rock to Charles.

54
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,750
He said the FBI was gonna have it tested.

55
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,920
When they do, they'll tell you
that it's covered in fake blood

56
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,839
that you can buy at a drugstore.

57
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,801
-What the hell are you talking about?
-I don't want you to worry anymore.

58
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,761
I'm really sorry
that you've been worrying.

59
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,638
Jughead's fine.

60
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,892
He's-- Okay, he's not fine, but he's okay.

61
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:04,851
Hold on.

62
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,186
-You know where Jughead is?
-Yes.

63
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,859
I will tell you everything, okay?

64
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,653
But we really, really need your help,
please?

65
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,322
I'm afraid to ask, but what kind of help?

66
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,241
For starters...

67
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,827
a search party.

68
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,205
[Jughead] <i>Archie went rogue</i>
<i>and told his mom, too.</i>

69
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,884
Mom, I have to confess something to you.

70
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,013
[Jughead] <i>And then there was</i>
<i>Veronica's sister, Hermosa,</i>

71
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,765
<i>who was sniffing around,</i>
<i>looking for bones.</i>

72
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,309
All right. What do you want to know?

73
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,896
Let me ask you straight up, <i>hermanita.</i>

74
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,192
Did you help Betty kill her boyfriend?

75
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,443
What?

76
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,362
No, why would I do that?

77
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,240
Because that's the kind of thing
secret girlfriends do.

78
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,784
They kill each other's boyfriends
so they can be together.

79
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,743
Okay.

80
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,289
I don't know what kind of crypto-lesbian
pulp fiction you're conjuring, Hermosa,

81
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,666
but Betty and I are just friends.

82
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,460
Well, then what did happen
to that dead <i>Torombolo?</i>

83
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,880
Either you can tell me,
or I'll just keep digging.

84
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,008
-Don't forget, I'm a licensed private--
-Private investigator. Right.

85
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,430
I'm not sure why I didn't think
of this before...

86
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,559
but maybe you could help us
with something.

87
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,769
Me, Betty and Archie.

88
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,565
How much do you charge, Hermosa?

89
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,902
And is there a discount
for family members?

90
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,780
[Jughead] <i>In the months that followed,</i>
<i>people will ask us,</i>

91
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,031
<i>did we need to do it?</i>

92
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,659
<i>Go to such extreme lengths?</i>

93
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,995
<i>Maybe. Maybe not.</i>

94
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,330
<i>But this I did know:</i>

95
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,837
<i>If I was going to recover without</i>
<i>the preppies trying to kill me again</i>

96
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,047
<i>and figure out how to solve my own murder,</i>

97
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,467
<i>I needed the illusion to be perfect</i>
<i>to buy myself time.</i>

98
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,762
[woman] Please make sure
you're following along.

99
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,182
[Jughead] <i>And so while above me,</i>
<i>a world without Jughead</i>

100
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,934
<i>continued spinning forward...</i>

101
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,439
<i>I pored over every scrap</i>
<i>of evidence we'd gathered.</i>

102
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,650
<i>Went over every detail of my time</i>
<i>at Stonewall Prep,</i>

103
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,028
<i>looking for hidden patterns,</i>
<i>hints and clues.</i>

104
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,240
<i>But this was a different kind of mystery</i>
<i>than the ones we'd tackled before.</i>

105
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,700
<i>This wasn't a whodunit.</i>

106
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,787
<i>This was a whydunit. More psychological.</i>

107
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,916
<i>I needed to get under my suspects' skin,</i>
<i>inside their heads.</i>

108
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,880
<i>I had to let my intuition take over,</i>
<i>to draw these strands together.</i>

109
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,715
<i>The missing Stonewall Four,</i>

110
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,759
<i>the accidental deaths</i>
<i>of DuPont's classmates,</i>

111
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,885
<i>my attempted murder.</i>

112
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,511
<i>How were they all connected?</i>

113
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,182
<i>A key piece of information</i>
<i>came from Hermosa.</i>

114
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,642
<i>Which was that Donna--</i>

115
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,062
Jug?

116
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,648
Jug?

117
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,151
Are you okay?

118
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,237
Yeah, sorry. I was just going
over everything one more time.

119
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,116
{\an8}-What's up? Did they find him?
-Yeah. Yes. We did.

120
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,702
{\an8}-Well, I mean, Charles and FP did.
-Did he agree?

121
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,871
Completely.

122
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,831
He's showering as we speak.

123
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,628
-So, are we gonna do this or what?
-Oh, yeah.

124
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,006
{\an8}We are gonna blow Stonewall Prep
out of the water.

125
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,937
<i>Crime and Punishment,</i>

126
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,899
{\an8}a novel of murder
and its psychological toll.

127
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:41,943
{\an8}Floor is open.

128
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,280
{\an8}Any thoughts regarding
Dostoyevsky's take on morality?

129
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,203
{\an8}Hey, guys.

130
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,207
{\an8}What? Did you even miss me?

131
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,751
{\an8}-You gotta be kidding me.
-Mr. Jones.

132
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,004
{\an8}I, uh-- I don't understand.
We all thought--

133
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,297
{\an8}That I was dead? Well...

134
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,384
{\an8}-actually for a minute there, I did, too.
-Yeah.

135
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,470
{\an8}Hey, what's that, um,
oft-used Mark Twain quote?

136
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,682
{\an8}"Rumors of my death
have been greatly exaggerated."

137
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,642
{\an8}What is happening right now?

138
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,354
{\an8}It is called getting
your comeuppance, Joan.

139
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,816
You guys are reading
<i>Crime and Punishment,</i> huh?

140
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,612
How... apropos.

141
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,202
{\an8}You know, the one kind of crime story
that we never touched upon in this seminar

142
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,123
{\an8}is the time-tested genre
of a locked-room mystery.

143
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,293
{\an8}Where all the suspects
are sequestered in a room,

144
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,919
{\an8}one or more of them could be the killer,

145
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,964
{\an8}but the door is not unlocked
until the identity is revealed.

146
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,841
{\an8}Betty, could you do the honor?

147
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,560
{\an8}The next bell doesn't ring
for half an hour,

148
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,938
{\an8}so for the next 30 minutes,
your asses belong to us.

149
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,149
I knew you weren't really dead.

150
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,318
{\an8}Good job, Donna.

151
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,404
{\an8}Yet, since you failed to prove it
or find Jughead,

152
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,949
{\an8}we had time to figure out all the twists
and turns of this murder mystery

153
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,035
that we've all been living
for the past few months.

154
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,995
{\an8}I have no idea what you're talking about.

155
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,789
{\an8}Oh, look, don't worry.
I'll take you through it step by step.

156
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,958
This is ridiculous.
Mr. DuPont, I'm calling security.

157
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,046
Shut the hell up, Bret. Like I said,
for the next 30 minutes, we're in charge,

158
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,339
so give me your phones.

159
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,966
{\an8}-Why the hell--?
-Joan, just do what she says.

160
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,178
{\an8}We have nothing to hide.

161
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,388
{\an8}I'd get comfortable if I were you.

162
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,725
{\an8}'Cause I'm going to take you through it
from the very beginning.

163
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,229
{\an8}Starting with that very curious fact
that both Moose Mason and myself

164
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,731
{\an8}were invited to Stonewall Prep
during our senior year.

165
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,860
Jughead?

166
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,278
Moose.

167
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,324
What the hell? It's good to see you.

168
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,161
{\an8}Was it like that when you met
my grandfather, Forsythe the First?

169
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,829
{\an8}He was asked to study at Stonewall, too.

170
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,958
{\an8}You were roommates with him,
weren't you, Mr. DuPont?

171
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,334
Yes.

172
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,212
And you're very much like him, Mr. Jones.

173
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,423
Your grandfather was
an arrogant fool, too.

174
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,050
Why do you say that?

175
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:12,969
Huh?

176
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,223
Because he had the gall to consider
himself worthy of your inner circle?

177
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,059
The first iteration
of Stonewall's Literary Society.

178
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,270
What exactly is this proving?

179
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,814
That this is not a story about a murder.

180
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,985
This is a story about grandparents
and their grandchildren.

181
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:34,490
Of the sins from one generation
being passed down to the next.

182
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,660
Cycles of violence.

183
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,329
Which brings me to my next point:

184
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:44,333
Halloween, when I was drugged
by you psychos.

185
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,543
I think I...

186
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,004
I think I need some air.

187
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:50,881
No.

188
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,259
You need to lie down.

189
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,845
[heart beating]

190
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,389
Say hello to the Stonewall Four for us.

191
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,560
[Jughead] <i>Only to wake up in a coffin</i>
<i>and be let out a day later...</i>

192
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,231
<i>to return to my dorm.</i>

193
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,443
Moose, you are not going
to believe what Bret--

194
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,737
<i>And find that Moose had vanished.</i>

195
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,701
So, naturally, I assumed he went out
the same way as the Stonewall Four,

196
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,705
that group of students
that mysteriously vanished

197
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,249
while attending Stonewall Prep
over a few decades.

198
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,542
Oh, here we go again.

199
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,670
Now, Moose's fate was more banal.
He joined the Army.

200
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,589
But there's a twist.

201
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,550
Mr. Chipping was the one
who encouraged Moose to enlist.

202
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,261
But it was more like force him to.

203
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,348
He was encouraging me to leave.
Until Halloween night,

204
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,601
when it became more than a suggestion.
He practically shoved me out the door.

205
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,936
So, what was the connection
between Moose and Chipping

206
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,688
that would make him take his advice?

207
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,523
He recruited me to play football.

208
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,611
Wait, Mr. Chipping's the reason
why you went to Stonewall Prep?

209
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,740
Chipping had recruited Moose
the same way he had Jughead,

210
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,284
and then ran him out of Stonewall Prep.

211
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,036
Meaning what, exactly?

212
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,955
Meaning, Chipping knew
Moose was going to get murdered

213
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,957
and was trying to save his life.

214
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,835
And I would remember that next point.
It's gonna be on the quiz.

215
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,170
-Oh, Mr. Jon--
-Shut up!

216
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,008
Mr. DuPont,
as they say in <i>Lord of the Flies:</i>

217
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,344
"I have the conch."

218
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,101
Now, after Halloween is
when things got really interesting.

219
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,646
See, that's when you announced
the writing competition.

220
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,441
Chipping has written
the last four Baxter Brothers books.

221
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,943
It's time he pass on the torch.

222
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,197
And someone in this very room was going
to be anointed the next ghostwriter.

223
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,325
You had already taken
a shine to me, Mr. DuPont.

224
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,911
You were asking about my father
and my grandfather.

225
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,455
Your grandfather was an excellent writer.

226
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,834
Tell me, how's he doing?
Does he still write?

227
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,961
So, imagine my surprise...

228
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,257
when I found out my good-for-nothing,
dropout grandfather

229
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,386
had actually written
the original Baxter Brothers novel.

230
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,472
Which a young Francis DuPont
would steal from him.

231
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,392
It was a 100 percent legal transaction,
a sale--

232
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,435
It was highway robbery.

233
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,439
A measly 5 grand for an idea
that generated millions of dollars?

234
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,191
You exploited Forsythe, Mr. DuPont.

235
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,320
You took advantage of a kid
from the wrong side of the tracks.

236
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,781
And if that secret ever came out,

237
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,701
can you imagine the damage that would do

238
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,412
to the very valuable
Baxter Brothers brand?

239
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,330
[exhales] Hell...

240
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,333
someone might kill to keep that secret.

241
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,838
Which is exactly what we thought
happened with Mr. Chipping.

242
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,548
I told Chipping about my gramps.

243
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,925
Then he talked to you, Mr. DuPont.

244
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,052
And the very next day, well...

245
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,184
I think we all remember
his dive out the window.

246
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,897
I thought you had urged him to do it,
that you had some leverage over Chipping.

247
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,108
You guys were part of the same
secret society, Quill and Skull.

248
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,152
But it was actually you guys.

249
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:03,741
It was your... blank expressions
as you watched him jump.

250
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,284
Call an ambulance!

251
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,372
I just couldn't shake it.

252
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,127
That's when I knew
there was a deeper game afoot.

253
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,547
No, Chipping suicided because
he was messing around with Donna.

254
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,050
-She ended it and he short-circuited.
-Except...

255
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,513
they never really had
a physical relationship.

256
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,264
Isn't that right, Donna?

257
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,935
-We had an affair, and it got out of hand.
-Mm-hm.

258
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,146
Yes, an affair that went down exactly

259
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,900
like the affair that you had with...
Mr. Kotter.

260
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,819
Except, I looked into it and...

261
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,573
turns out there is no Mr. Kotter.

262
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,159
-Rupert-- Rupert had demons.
-Oh, he did.

263
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,538
Mrs. Chipping filled us in
on all of those.

264
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:57,378
Yeah, she said that he had been
drinking more and having trouble sleeping.

265
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,130
Complaining about
the Baxter Brothers books.

266
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,633
Wishing he'd never gotten the contract.

267
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,843
So, then we started to ask ourselves,

268
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,763
what would turn
the opportunity of a lifetime,

269
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,767
winning the Baxter Brothers contract,
into a burden? An albatross?

270
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,102
Any ideas?

271
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,774
The ghostwriter challenge was
to devise the perfect murder.

272
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,654
What if the real challenge,
the real price that someone had to pay,

273
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,406
was to commit the perfect murder?

274
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,909
In order to prove that you could write it,
first you had to do it.

275
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,956
I mean, it kind of makes
a twisted pathological sense, no?

276
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,458
And that's what was tormenting
Mr. Chipping.

277
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,961
The guilt of what he had done,

278
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,464
the blood that he had shed
in order to win the contract.

279
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,010
Mr. Chipping invited Moose
to Stonewall Prep to be the next victim,

280
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,138
to be killed by the next ghostwriter,
one of you.

281
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,765
And Moose was the perfect candidate.

282
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,602
He was a messed-up kid, he had no family.

283
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,395
He couldn't handle the stresses of life.

284
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,399
After my dad was arrested
for impersonating the Gargoyle King,

285
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,446
it, uh... kind of blew up my life,
my family, everything.

286
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,032
I even ended up in a facility
for a couple months.

287
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,701
Chipping ran Moose out of town.

288
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,703
You said it yourself.

289
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,247
Good. You remembered. Okay.

290
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,041
We think Chipping couldn't go
through with it

291
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,461
and/or maybe he just wanted to atone
for what he had done.

292
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,882
Whatever the reason, he ran Moose
the hell away from Stonewall Prep

293
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,468
and then killed himself.
It was his only escape.

294
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,221
Pure demented conjecture.

295
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,514
Well, yes and no.

296
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,392
Chipping's behavior is hypothesis,
but if proven,

297
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:39,313
it shows a pattern of how the previous
ghostwriters won their contracts.

298
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,858
The same year, the same month
as Chipping was awarded his contract,

299
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,193
a Stonewall student disappeared.

300
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,445
<i>One of the so-called Stonewall Four.</i>

301
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,660
We believe this student was murdered
by Mr. Chipping.

302
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,543
Ryan Allan, the previous ghostwriter
who took up the mantle

303
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,213
<i>the same month another one</i>
<i>of the Stonewall Four disappeared.</i>

304
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,176
The sequence holds true
for every ghostwriter who preceded them.

305
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,303
It's actually incredibly simple.

306
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:15,474
Which brings us to a couple months ago
when I was awarded the contract.

307
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:16,892
But why?

308
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,561
To put a target on my back.

309
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:24,483
Probably because I was circling the truth,
so he gave you guys a new challenge:

310
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,112
To commit the perfect murder against me...

311
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,656
and be awarded the contract.

312
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,160
[Betty]
So, the million-dollar question is...

313
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,124
who was going to kill Jughead, and how?

314
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,382
So, which one of you
heartless bastards killed me?

315
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,179
It was actually Mr. DuPont
that gave me a clue.

316
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,057
When I asked who had rewritten
my Baxter Brothers novel,

317
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,684
you told me they all had a crack at it.

318
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:04,732
Well, actually, all of your classmates
collaborated on it.

319
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,693
And that suggested to me that
each one of you had a hand in my murder.

320
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,861
This should be good.

321
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,612
Donna, you kept Betty busy.

322
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,451
Oh, good, you made it.

323
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,703
[Jughead] <i>Bret, you led me deeper</i>
<i>into the woods,</i>

324
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:21,123
<i>where I took off the bunny mask</i>
<i>I was wearing and put on my beanie.</i>

325
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,296
<i>And was it that beanie that kept my head</i>
<i>from being completely cracked open</i>

326
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,839
<i>when Joan crept up behind me</i>

327
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,842
<i>and hit me with a baseball-sized rock?</i>

328
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,678
What? How do you know it was me?
Why couldn't it have been Jonathan?

329
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,473
Well, I don't recall
Jonathan wearing your perfume.

330
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,349
Yeah, where--?

331
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,642
Where is Jonathan again?

332
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,353
Or did you kill him because he started
to develop a conscience?

333
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,688
He had food poisoning.

334
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,274
-He still has food poisoning.
-Okay.

335
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:52,071
Jonathan aside, you had a foolproof plan,
airtight alibis.

336
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,114
It all should have worked so perfectly,

337
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,240
but it didn't.

338
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,244
-Why?
-Because in all your plotting,

339
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,831
all of your lurid conspiring
and your brilliance, you didn't kill me.

340
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,167
Whose job was it to check my pulse?

341
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,335
Jonathan!

342
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,760
Oh, you Einsteins, all you had to do
was hit me in the back of the head

343
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,178
hard enough with the rock.

344
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,597
You failed, spectacularly.

345
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,058
Yeah, meanwhile, Donna was blowing
Devil's Breath in my face

346
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,435
to set me up as the ultimate fall girl.

347
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,023
Devil's Breath? Really?

348
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,234
Yeah, the technical term
being scopolamine,

349
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,028
which leaves a person highly suggestive
and in a drunken state,

350
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,406
<i>which is why I don't remember</i>
<i>when Donna led me into the clearing</i>

351
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,743
<i>where Jughead's body was</i>
<i>and placed the bloody rock in my hand,</i>

352
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,038
<i>leaving me literally red-handed</i>
<i>with the murder weapon.</i>

353
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,875
<i>After which, the four of you returned</i>
<i>to the party,</i>

354
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,044
<i>and ran into Archie and Veronica.</i>

355
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,046
Hey.

356
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,340
Have you guys seen Betty and Jughead?

357
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,761
I think they went that way,
into the clearing behind those trees.

358
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,766
Thanks.

359
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,816
[Betty] <i>And pointed them</i>
<i>to where you knew they would find me...</i>

360
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,902
<i>standing over Jughead's corpse.</i>

361
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,405
-Oh, my God. Betty, what happened?
-Jug!

362
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,157
Is he breathing?

363
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,621
He's dead.

364
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,377
At which point, one of two scenarios
could have played out.

365
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,295
One...

366
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,673
Archie and Veronica could turn me in.

367
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,009
Two...

368
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,680
they could help me cover up the murder
that I had just committed.

369
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,184
Either way, I'm damned if I do
and damned if I don't,

370
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,103
but honestly, you guys could have
gotten away with it, too.

371
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,564
Yeah, except, uh, again...

372
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,816
you guys didn't kill me.

373
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,526
-Archie.
-Oh, my God.

374
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,779
-Oh, my God.
-Betty, what happened?

375
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,872
Arch, start pounding on his chest.
Right now, okay?

376
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,291
Vee, use the beanie
to stop the bleeding, go.

377
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,085
One, two, three, four, five.

378
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,674
-[Archie] One... Four, five.
-Come on, Jug.

379
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,968
-Wake up, wake up, Jug. Come on!
-[Veronica] He's dead.

380
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,386
Four...

381
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,472
-Betty, he's dead.
-Come back to me, Jug.

382
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,019
Jug! Hey, hey, hey.

383
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,104
Hey, we'll get you to a hospital, okay?

384
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,898
No. No hospital.

385
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,608
Jug...

386
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,902
Hey, stay awake. Stay with me please, Jug.

387
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,570
Hey, stay awake, okay?

388
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,283
Though I didn't regain consciousness
for another 36 hours.

389
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,869
The worst 36 hours of my life.

390
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,416
Why would you say that, Jones?

391
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,337
"No hospital." Why would a man
on death's door say that?

392
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,923
I honestly don't know.

393
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,844
Maybe I had some small feeling that
you were going to try and frame Betty,

394
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,764
and I wanted her to have
a fighting chance.

395
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,604
Um, I'm calling Charles.
I'm calling Charles.

396
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,231
-What? Why?
-We can trust him.

397
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,607
He'll help us, okay?

398
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,775
Hey, Jug.

399
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:24,157
Charles! I'm in the woods
with Archie and Veronica. Jughead,

400
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,743
he's hurt really badly.
We need-- We need help.

401
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,203
We need your help, please.

402
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,749
We carried Jug through the woods
to the old postal road

403
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:37,087
where my brother Charles was waiting
for us with an FBI med van.

404
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,844
-What happened to him, Betty?
-A head wound.

405
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,888
We slowed the bleeding.
We did chest compressions and CPR.

406
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,099
-You think he'll make it?
-We'll do everything we can.

407
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,392
[Veronica] And us? What do we do?

408
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,519
Go back to where you found him,
clean the scene.

409
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,355
Make absolutely certain that you don't
leave anything behind, all right?

410
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,401
Also, your clothes are covered with blood.
Get rid of those and get washed up, okay?

411
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,402
[all] Okay.

412
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,320
Come on.

413
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,953
[Betty] <i>And then we did</i>
<i>what Charles asked.</i>

414
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,913
<i>We went back to the clearing...</i>

415
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,334
<i>threw the bloody rock</i>
<i>in the swimming hole...</i>

416
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,628
<i>took off our clothes,</i>
<i>and started a bonfire.</i>

417
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,007
-What happens if he doesn't make it?
-He'll make it.

418
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,551
But what if he doesn't?

419
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,678
He will.

420
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,224
But if he doesn't...

421
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,018
then we...

422
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,604
Archie.

423
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,231
Archie.

424
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,234
-Archie!
-Yeah, yeah.

425
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,652
-Are you listening to me?
-Yeah.

426
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,493
We have to burn all of our clothes,
including Jughead's beanie.

427
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,288
We'll rinse off the blood
in the swimming hole.

428
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,502
After tonight,
we never speak of this, ever.

429
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,755
Not to each other, not to our parents.
No one.

430
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:07,260
We'll finish our senior year, graduate,
and we'll go our separate ways.

431
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,138
That is the only way
that we won't get caught.

432
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:14,893
Do it.

433
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,112
That is how it'll have to be
if Jug doesn't make it.

434
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,156
But it won't come to that.
He will pull through.

435
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,449
He has to.

436
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,618
<i>And then...</i>

437
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,453
<i>we went home.</i>

438
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,084
And what happened next
was a waking nightmare.

439
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,379
Not knowing if or when Jughead
was going to wake up.

440
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,842
And wondering if I had actually
been responsible.

441
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,594
Wait, but we saw Jughead's corpse
at the coroner's office.

442
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,681
-Was he in on it?
-Who? Dr. Curdle Jr.?

443
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,102
Yeah. Mm-hm. Yeah. We go way back.

444
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,064
[Jughead] <i>You see, Bret,</i>
<i>in a town like Riverdale,</i>

445
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,024
<i>everybody's got a price.</i>

446
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,820
<i>And that includes our friendly</i>
<i>neighborhood doctor of death.</i>

447
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:13,368
And while Betty was keeping you guys busy
with a game of cat and mouse,

448
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,997
I was in the underground bunker
untangling this Gordian knot of a year.

449
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:21,209
And it is crazy how much untangling
you can get done

450
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:25,130
-when everyone thinks you're dead.
-Which brings us basically to today.

451
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,716
So, Mr. DuPont...

452
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,636
floor's open. What do you think?

453
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,973
Oh, Mr. Jones...

454
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,435
A for effort.

455
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,731
If nothing else, this fiction
is significantly more entertaining

456
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,025
than anything you ever produced
for my class.

457
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,486
Oh, did I forget to mention
that Betty and I went and saw

458
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,238
the Baxter Brothers ghostwriters?

459
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:54,117
And when we told them our theory,
they all asked for their lawyers.

460
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,286
What if you did track them down?

461
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,373
And even if you found one
who corroborated your wild theories

462
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,919
in some vague way,
then you will know that I never

463
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:08,548
explicitly directed my students
or mentees to do anything criminal.

464
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,633
Oh.

465
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:13,845
What a canny serial killer you are,
Mr. DuPont.

466
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,097
But we haven't even gotten
to the best part.

467
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:20,894
Specifically, the three members
of your original Literary Society

468
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,771
who you murdered.

469
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:28,818
<i>Jane Dallas Brown, Charles W. Chickens,</i>
<i>Theodore Weisel.</i>

470
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,364
There it is.

471
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,741
Let's loop back to the original sin,
shall we?

472
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,410
When Mr. DuPont stole,
and I do mean "stole,"

473
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,329
my grandfather's original
Baxter Brothers novel.

474
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,540
A fact known to you, Mr. DuPont,
and of course Jughead's grandfather,

475
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,628
but also to your inner circle,
your classmates.

476
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,674
The corrupt secret
at the heart of an empire.

477
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,801
[Jughead] Well, there wasn't
an empire just yet.

478
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,804
It was a house of cards that you built
over many decades.

479
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,305
And the bigger it got,

480
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,475
the more worried you became
that one little slip of the tongue

481
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,686
would send the whole thing tumbling down.

482
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,480
Your life's work would be revealed
as a lie

483
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:09,067
and you as a fraud and a thief,

484
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,694
a man of dishonor.

485
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,030
So, you started going after people
who knew the truth

486
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:18,034
and started staging
their accidental deaths.

487
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:22,455
You cut brakes.
You tampered with fuselages.

488
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,792
You compromised oxygen tanks.

489
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,462
Until there was only one living member
of your Literary Society left.

490
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,423
Betty...

491
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,092
I think it's time we let in our guest.

492
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:35,677
With pleasure.

493
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,848
[lock clicking]

494
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,740
Forsythe?

495
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,325
Live and in the flesh.

496
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,952
Hello, Francis.

497
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,538
Why don't you tell him
what you told us, Grandpa?

498
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,833
Weisel came to see me before he died.

499
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,794
He hadn't slept for days.

500
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:16,009
He told me
that you killed Charles and Jane

501
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:21,222
'cause they were gonna spill the truth
about the damn Baxter Brothers.

502
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,311
He said we knew too much,
and you were gonna off us, too.

503
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,689
You and I both know
Theodore was a paranoid drunk.

504
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,816
But two days later,

505
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:36,863
the expert diver drowned in shallow water.

506
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,657
So, he was right.

507
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,868
And I was next.

508
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,873
So, I went out for a pack of cigarettes...

509
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,668
and I never came back.

510
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,172
What were you doing off-grid
since 2002 exactly?

511
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,009
Collecting evidence
that linked Francis here

512
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,721
with the murders of Charles
and Jane and Theodore.

513
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:06,810
I started by calling hotels and motels
near the accident sites.

514
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,854
You know what the one thing I couldn't
figure out at first was, Mr. DuPont?

515
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,775
That if Moose was invited
to Stonewall Prep to be the next victim,

516
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,193
then why was I also invited?

517
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,238
I was bait.

518
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,282
To lure my grandfather out of hiding,

519
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,201
so you could finish the job
that you started.

520
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,955
Took off like a coward
after Jughead found me.

521
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,625
But to my old man's credit, when Charles
and I found him the second time

522
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,919
and he heard what happened
to his grandson...

523
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,797
he figured it was finally time
to take your ass down.

524
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,091
[Charles] While you were in here
playing Agatha Christie,

525
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,885
my team was combing through DuPont's house
for the last hour.

526
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,556
Given the trophies of your victims
that we found in your hollowed-out OED

527
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,599
and your ghostwriters lawyering up...

528
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,812
not to mention Forsythe's detective work,
well...

529
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,356
Why don't you tell him?

530
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,651
It's over, Francis.

531
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,031
You...

532
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,952
call me a thief and a coward?

533
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,288
Well, I'm not.

534
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,248
I'm a builder.

535
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,917
I built the Baxter Brothers franchise,

536
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,378
and with that money,
I helped build this school.

537
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,214
Without me, neither would exist.

538
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,300
Francis DuPont,
you have the right to remain silent.

539
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,761
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in court.

540
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,720
Never.

541
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,514
A writer's power is in his words.

542
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,435
Only the meek and the timid
choose silence.

543
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,855
I am... a man of honor.

544
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,569
To the end.

545
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,801
[Jughead] <i>After that, it was a matter</i>
<i>of dotting I's and crossing T's.</i>

546
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,221
We obtained these text exchanges
between you and Donna.

547
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,808
Donna was manipulating you, Joan.

548
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,812
She tricked you into doing her dirty work
so her hands would remain clean.

549
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:18,191
Don't protect her. I'll see to it
that you get a reduced sentence--

550
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,319
Agent Smith, you have nothing to offer me.

551
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,911
Reminder, my father is an ambassador,
and I have diplomatic immunity.

552
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,540
If you leave the country now,
you won't ever be able to return.

553
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,834
And your friends,
they'll take all the heat.

554
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,211
They're not my friends.

555
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,848
Hey. Why did you lie to Jughead?

556
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,393
You told him Bret had diplomatic immunity,
but it was Joan.

557
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,104
I-- I lied to Jughead

558
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,774
because I was trying to keep him
from antagonizing Bret.

559
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,862
You know it was Bret's idea
to kill Jughead.

560
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,865
Uh-huh. How did you get
Mr. Chipping's tiepin?

561
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,868
And don't tell me
that you were having an affair.

562
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,744
No one's buying that story anymore.

563
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,747
Mr. DuPont gave it to me.

564
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,127
Said I had to lie to the headmaster

565
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,546
so that Mr. Chipping's death
would be ruled a suicide

566
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,464
and people would stop asking questions.

567
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,888
But I'm just glad
that the real monster behind all of this,

568
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,098
Mr. DuPont, has paid for his crimes.

569
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,854
[Charles] You have a known history
of antagonizing Jughead.

570
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:41,024
Witnesses saw you walking with him
into the woods the night he was attacked.

571
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,568
Have I actually been charged with a crime?

572
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,238
You're facing hard time
for both attempted murder

573
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,199
and the creation and possession
of illegally recorded sex tapes

574
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,535
featuring your fellow students,

575
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,037
including Jughead and Betty.

576
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:55,955
Now...

577
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,626
I'm willing to reduce your charge
to only attempted murder

578
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,754
if you turn over your collection
of videotapes.

579
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,047
Here's my counteroffer:

580
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,467
Reduce my charge to conspiracy
after the fact,

581
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,219
which my lawyer will plead down
to community service,

582
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:15,016
or Betty and Jughead's puerile sex tape
will be released to the World Wide Web.

583
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,561
Hm. Let me think it over.

584
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:26,986
[door closes]

585
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,949
-[door opens]
-That was quick.

586
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,285
[door closes]

587
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,750
What the hell is this?

588
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,128
-The counter to your counter.
-Wait--

589
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,380
[blow lands]

590
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,595
I understand that you've decided
to cooperate with our investigation

591
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,098
and reveal the location
of your illicit videotapes.

592
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,058
Is that correct?

593
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:03,481
[Alice] <i>Hidden in a secret compartment</i>
<i>behind Stonewall's crest</i>

594
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,859

595
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,195
<i>Illegally recorded videotapes.</i>

596
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,116
<i>More fuel to add to the firestorm</i>

597
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,369

600
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:26,004
{\an8}<i>For RIVW news, this is Alice Smith.</i>

601
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,548
{\an8}<i>It's good to be back, Riverdale.</i>

602
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,719
Thank you. Thank you very much.

603
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,637
Your report came out really good, Mom.

604
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,223
Oh, thanks, honey.
I had a lot of help from an inside source.

605
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,391
[both] Mm-hm.

606
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,018
[FP and Alice laugh]

607
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,103
-Okay, I'm gonna head out.
-Yeah.

608
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,023
Wait, where are you going?
We're about to have cake.

609
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,110
Um, I will be back soon, okay?

610
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,530
I just have one last T to cross.

611
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,163
Hello, Donna.

612
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,123
Going somewhere?

613
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,710
If you must know,
I'm transferring to a new school.

614
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:09,505
Well, I'm glad I caught you, then.
I wanted to congratulate you personally.

615
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,341
Jughead and I heard that you're
taking over the Baxter Brothers.

616
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,302
The brand is relaunching.

617
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,721
As Tracy True.

618
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,724
Jealous?

619
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,477
Your plan worked, Donna.

620
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:26,606
You managed to get everyone else
to do the actual dirty work.

621
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,441
Hell, even DuPont's dead.

622
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:32,904
You covered your tracks extremely well.

623
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,447
Betty...

624
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,577
are you really so delusional,

625
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:44,290
you would believe I would mastermind
some elaborate conspiracy

626
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,584
that caused the deaths of multiple people

627
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,587
just to win a YA book contract?

628
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,091
No.

629
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,344
But you would do it for revenge.

630
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,970
Oh, really?

631
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,682
-Revenge for what?
-The murder of your grandmother.

632
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,103
<i>Jane Dallas Brown.</i>

633
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,356
One of the classmates DuPont killed
to cover up the ugly truth

634
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,650
that he didn't create the Baxter Brothers.

635
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,652
She was your grandmother.

636
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,322
-How could you possibly know that?
-A friend of a friend told me.

637
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,117
You dedicated yourself
to getting into Stonewall Prep

638
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,535
and getting into Chipping's class,

639
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,914
and each step brought you ever-closer
to your grandmother's killer.

640
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,292
You wanted... revenge.

641
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,254
So, what was the original plan, Donna?

642
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,799
Win the contract,
no matter how many people had to die?

643
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,844
And then stage an accident
that would take care of DuPont

644
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,763
so you could tear down
the house that he built?

645
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,015
Fascinating theory, Betty.

646
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,227
You left out one minor detail.

647
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,980
DuPont didn't merely kill my grandmother.

648
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,232
He stole from her,

649
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,526
the same way he did from Forsythe.

650
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,196
Tracy True,

651
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,866
the female teen detective
who was introduced

652
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,409
in the Baxter Brothers books.

653
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,287
She was your grandmother's invention.

654
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:09,876
Now I've taken Tracy back
and DuPont is rotting in a grave.

655
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,252
Oh.

656
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,838
How did you really find out
about my grandmother?

657
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,548
A private investigator...

658
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:19,343
At my behest, Hermosa put
her private-eye skills to good use

659
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,054
and did some digging
on those Stonewall wasps.

660
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,433
And your gal-pal Donna is not so sweet.

661
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,769
...who supplied us with the medical files

662
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,648
that confirmed that you are
the granddaughter of Jane Dallas Brown,

663
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,443
which gives the police a motive

664
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:39,697
and links this entire web of death...

665
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:41,908
back to you.

666
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,202
It's circumstantial, at best.

667
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,496
But I'll play one last round.

668
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:49,957
What do you want, Betty?

669
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,421
I want you to walk away
from the Tracy True contract.

670
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,549
Why in God's name would I do that?

671
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,845
Fictional though she may be,
Tracy deserves better.

672
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,972
As does the memory of your grandmother.

673
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:10,603
And you certainly don't deserve to profit
off the near-death of my boyfriend.

674
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:13,689
Or...

675
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,108
don't walk away.

676
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,610
That's fine.

677
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,322
But I will make sure
every newspaper of every major city

678
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,157
gets a copy of that medical file.

679
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,374
You play nice from now on, Donna.

680
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,503
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

681
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,566
Months at Stonewall Prep,
away from you guys,

682
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,695
-what a waste.
-Jug. Okay.

683
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:04,532
We put a stop to DuPont,
we solved eight murders,

684
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,535
and we gave closure to every family
of every missing child.

685
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,412
I would not call that a waste of time.

686
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,289
I know. It's just...

687
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,000
I feel...

688
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,210
Cheated?

689
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,296
I know.

690
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,093
I know. You'll find a meaning
to all of this...

691
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,221
at some point, okay?

692
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,104
So, Jughead Jones, back from the dead.

693
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,605
Color me completely not surprised.

694
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,024
[bell ringing]

695
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:38,941
You're not?

696
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,902
No one ever really dies in Riverdale,
do they?

697
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,657
But... what about
you and Archie canoodling then?

698
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,659
Yeah, that was just pretend.

699
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,288
I don't know, cousin,
that looked pretty real to me.

700
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,998
Well, yeah, that was the point.

701
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,668
Right.

702
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,714
All I'm saying is,
your secret's safe with me.

703
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,466
Toodles!

704
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,139
-What did Cheryl want?
-Nothing.

705
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,557
What did Mr. Honey say?

706
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,560
He isn't happy, but he legally has
to let me back to Riverdale High.

707
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,897
-That's great.
-Yeah, I just hope my credits transfer.

708
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,275
On the bright side, no one's going
to try to kill me while I'm here.

709
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,443
Don't jinx yourself.

710
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,115
[FP] Hey, boy.

711
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,617
-Betty.
-[Betty] Hey.

712
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,620
Um, I'll be right down.

713
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:33,829
Grandpa.

714
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,624
-I thought you left.
-No, no. Not yet.

715
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,876
You joining us for dinner?

716
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,756
Betty and I are actually going to meet
Archie and Veronica at Pop's, so...

717
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,217
-Unless you want me to stay.
-No, go have fun.

718
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,385
Yeah.

719
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,888
Should I... say goodbye?

720
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,264
Oh, no, no.

721
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:57,228
I expect your father and I will
still be talking when you get back.

722
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,358
Hey, hold on.

723
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,864
I don't know what's gonna happen
with him and me,

724
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,826
but we're talking, so that's something.

725
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,454
So... thank you.

726
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,289
You made all this happen.

727
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,460
Have fun.

728
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,546
-[Jughead] Ready?
-Mm-hm.

729
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,465
[Jughead] Maybe something good did
come out of this whole Stonewall mess.

730
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:30,553
My dad and my grandfather talking again
for the first time in 30 years.

731
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,555
Who would've thought of that?

732
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,890
-Do you think your dad will forgive him?
-Oh, I don't know.

733
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:39,145
I mean, they have a lot of bad history
between each other, but... I hope so.

734
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,522
All right, guys.

735
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,191
-Let's make a vow.
-Ugh.

736
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,026
-[Archie] I know.
-[Veronica] Mm.

737
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,027
I know.

738
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,572
The last time we made a vow
to have a normal senior year,

739
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,282
everything went to hell pretty quick.

740
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,161
But we only have two, three months left.

741
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,121
Let's end it on a high note.

742
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,833
Are we gonna ignore the fact
that Archie and I

743
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,668
will probably not be graduating
with you guys?

744
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,963
Jug, okay. Do you really think
Vee and I are going to sit idly by

745
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,048
and not help our boyfriends graduate?

746
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,303
Archie Andrews and Jughead Jones,
you will graduate.

747
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:16,891
Even if it takes a thousand tutors,
you will set aside everything,

748
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,309
no more mysteries,

749
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,354
and make graduating
your sole purpose in life.

750
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,317
-Why does that sound like a threat?
-[Veronica] Because it is.

751
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,654
To going out on top. Together.

752
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,781
-Cheers.
-Cheers to that.

753
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,368
Guys, guys, just a reminder,

754
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,079
I'm posting the sign-up sheet
for the variety show tomorrow.

755
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,664
You all have to perform.

756
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,958
Even you, Jughead.

757
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,835
Count us in, Kev.

758
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,086
Oh, no.

759
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,963
Yes.

760
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,675
Check out this list of local names.
