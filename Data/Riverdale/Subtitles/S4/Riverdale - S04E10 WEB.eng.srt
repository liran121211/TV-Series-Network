00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,137
[Jughead] <i>Spirit Week had arrived</i>
<i>at Riverdale High.</i>

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:16,182
<i>And for the first time in years,</i>
<i>the students had something to celebrate.</i>

3
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:21,354
<i>The long-suffering Bulldogs, in large part</i>
<i>thanks to breakout star Munroe Moore,</i>

4
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,107
<i>were finally going to the state finals</i>

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,402
<i>where they would take on</i>
<i>the undisputed titans of the gridiron,</i>

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,237
<i>the Stonewall Stallions.</i>

7
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,365
<i>For Principal Honey,</i>
<i>who commissioned an article about the game</i>

8
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,034
<i>from ace reporter Betty Cooper,</i>

9
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:38,204
<i>the championship was, at last,</i>
<i>something positive to promote.</i>

10
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:42,083
<i>But for Riverdale's star QB,</i>
<i>Archie Andrews,</i>

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,378
<i>this Spirit Week was special</i>
<i>for a different reason.</i>

12
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,964
<i>It would be the last of his career.</i>

13
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:49,841
Jones.

14
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,218
How long have you had that machine?

15
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,596
Feels like forever. Why?

16
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,390
Think it's about time for an upgrade?

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,393
No, keys are used to my fingertips.

18
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,979
-Plus I'm sentimental and superstitious.
-[chuckles]

19
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,481
[computer chimes]

20
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,983
Oh, crap. I gotta go.

21
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,652
Mr. DuPont's summoned me for some reason.

22
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,783
[door opens, then closes]

23
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,578
How did I get an interview with Yale?
I didn't even apply.

24
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,664
Yes, but the recruiter is a friend of mine

25
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,251
so I slipped him your short stories
and he was quite impressed.

26
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,920
I assume you're interested?

27
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,132
Yale is my girlfriend's dream school
and she didn't get in, so...

28
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,928
Yes, well, the heart can be
a difficult minefield to navigate,

29
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,304
but take my advice:

30
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,015
Figure it out, don't be foolish.

31
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,393
[Reggie] <i>Mm. Gotta go with number three.</i>

32
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,312
It's damn good, Ronnie.

33
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,357
It's my special shimmy
on <i>Abuelita's</i> recipe.

34
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,485
I thought your dad patented
the recipe so you couldn't use it.

35
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,656
Daddy may have patented
our family recipe for his own profit,

36
00:01:54,739 --> 00:02:00,036
but this is a modified spiced rum,
with a unique flavor profile.

37
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,833
Now it's time to introduce Luna Rum
to the outside world.

38
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,670
[school bell rings]

39
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,090
[Honey] Cheryl.

40
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,968
Girls, how fortuitous.

41
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,887
-I'd like you to meet someone.
-[Cheryl] No time to chat.

42
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,306
We're on our way to practice
our Spirit Week musical routine,

43
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,058
which will, naturally, be epic.

44
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:27,188
On that subject,
as was discussed with Mrs. Burble,

45
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:31,484
I have brought in Miss Appleyard
to be your new coach.

46
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,695
But cheer season is almost done,
Mr. Honey.

47
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,489
I can handle this, Holden.

48
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,117
Hmm.

49
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,206
I'm not sure what Honey has told you,
but we don't need a coach.

50
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,374
I run the show around here.

51
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,627
Howevs,
we are looking for a launder woman.

52
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,297
From now on, we're gonna change things up.

53
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,134
The Vixens are a cheer squad,
so we'll be focusing on cheers,

54
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,720
not singing and dancing to pop songs.

55
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,848
Now, gather the rest of the girls
and meet me out on the field

56
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,808
so we can practice some drills, okay?

57
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,646
I'm sorry, am I hallucinating,
or did you just give me an order?

58
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,858
I led my last team to nationals
three years in a row.

59
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,402
I think I know what I'm doing here.

60
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,740
That's right, Munroe.

61
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,285
Okay. So, last game of the season.

62
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,454
-[exhales sharply]
-How do you feel, Arch?

63
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,998
Honestly? Like we're gonna win.

64
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,834
-[Munroe] Mm-hm.
-Hmm. Munroe, what about you?

65
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,836
I'm just happy to be playing
for the championship.

66
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,755
-[whoops]
-He's being humble, Betty.

67
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,924
A recruiter from Notre Dame
is coming just to see him.

68
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,884
Reggie, care to comment?

69
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,178
-You want a quote, Betts?
-[Betty] Sure.

70
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,679
I'll give you a quote:

71
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,724
-Stonewall sucks.
-[Munroe] Mmm.

72
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,686
The only reason why they're undefeated
is because they play dirty.

73
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,230
Dirty. Mm-hm.

74
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,816
Every team that's gone up against them
this year has suffered a horrible injury.

75
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,654
-What do you mean?
-I mean, they don't play to win.

76
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,489
They play to hurt.

77
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,244
But... they haven't gone up
against our guy.

78
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,454
Munroe.

79
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,668
-So, you excited for the big game?
-Everyone's pumped.

80
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,086
Can't wait to see you play.

81
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,380
If your arm's half as good
as your dad's was,

82
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,131
I bet you got a hell of a throw.

83
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,051
Hey, Uncle Frank.

84
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,220
-I've been thinking.
-Mm-hm.

85
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,347
Yeah, me, too. Look...

86
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,060
I really appreciate you putting me up
here for the last couple weeks.

87
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,895
Getting to meet you, getting to know you.

88
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,606
You're a great kid, Archie.

89
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,483
Your dad raised you well.

90
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,819
But, uh...

91
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,739
I think it's time I moved on.
I've paid my respects.

92
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,199
I was actually wondering...

93
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,368
what if you didn't leave?

94
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,413
You could help out here
or Andrews Construction.

95
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,792
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't interested.

96
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,585
Problem is, that means telling--

97
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,504
-Telling my mom you're in town.
-Yeah.

98
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,090
Like I've said,
not a lot of love lost there.

99
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,467
Whatever happened
between you guys in the past,

100
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,802
I'm sure you can work it out.

101
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,013
Hell, she'll probably be happy to see you.

102
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,687
Let me ask you, Frank, have you
even visited your brother's grave?

103
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,605
You didn't bother to show up
for the funeral.

104
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,775
I was on a crab boat, Mary.
I didn't get the news till a month ago.

105
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,113
Mom, I was thinking maybe Uncle Frank
could get a job at Andrews Construction.

106
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,117
-You asked my son for a job?
-No, Mom, the job was my idea.

107
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,202
[exhales sharply] Okay, fine.

108
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,704
But mark my words, Archie.

109
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,915
The second your uncle has to do
even an ounce of hard work,

110
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,543
he will bolt so fast, your head will spin.

111
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,468
[down-tempo music playing over speakers]

112
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:45,970
Jug.

113
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,099
You've been dipping that fry in ketchup
for five minutes. What's going on?

114
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,601
[sighs]

115
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,729
I have an interview
with a college recruiter.

116
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:55,980
For Yale.

117
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,526
I hope that's okay.

118
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,488
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?
Because I got rejected?

119
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,615
Well... yeah, kind of.

120
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,079
Well, I would never ask you
to turn down an opportunity like that

121
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,413
that was life-changing.

122
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,209
So, you're obviously gonna go
and ace that interview.

123
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,422
Meanwhile, I'll be working on my article
for Mr. Honey.

124
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,423
How's that going?

125
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,467
It's a puff piece.

126
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,595
Have you thought about interviewing
the opposing team?

127
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,931
-You know, Bret's team captain.
-Yeah, I know.

128
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:33,309
He's also the guy who attacked us
in a bunny mask.

129
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,311
You really want me to interview that jerk?

130
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,230
It could mean drama for your piece.

131
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,568
What can I do for you, Cheryl?

132
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,612
We got off
on the wrong Repetto-covered foot.

133
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,533
I'd like us to find a way
to work together in blissful harmony.

134
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,829
Cheryl, I'm the coach. You're the athlete.

135
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,206
The power structure couldn't be clearer.

136
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,333
As for your muffins,

137
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,836
can I suggest a little less time baking

138
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,046
and a little more time in the weight room?

139
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,258
My body is perfection, you crone!

140
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,301
And you may be the coach,

141
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,263
but I think you'll find the Vixens
are mine forever more.

142
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,017
[door closes]

143
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,440
Full disclosure, Bret,
I wasn't going to interview you.

144
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,693
But then I heard rumors
that your team plays dirty.

145
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,779
"They don't play to win.

146
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,282
They play to hurt."

147
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,827
Betty...

148
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,665
have you ever really watched
or studied football?

149
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,335
Because, sweetheart,
it's not a knitting circle.

150
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,963
It's social Darwinism in uniforms.

151
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:50,052
Football is... a sport of gladiators.

152
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,557
And you win by debilitating
and slaughtering your enemies.

153
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,768
Mm.

154
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,105
Gosh, I have to go, but...

155
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,233
you can quote me on that.

156
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,948
{\an8}You can bet your ass I will, psycho.

157
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,415
{\an8}[Veronica] As restaurant owners,

158
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,794
{\an8}you know the importance of quality
in every dish and glass you serve.

159
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:30,384
{\an8}Luna Rum is a small-batch operation,
focused on making each bottle special.

160
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,180
{\an8}The name Luna comes from my <i>abuelita</i> and

161
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,099
{\an8}generations of rum-making women
in my family.

162
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,894
{\an8}Interesting. Is that cardamom?

163
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,231
{\an8}Among other things.
It's my own special blend.

164
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:49,028
{\an8}Luna is all about valuing tradition,
while adding a touch of modern <i>sabor.</i>

165
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,781
I'll take a case. This is special.

166
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,616
{\an8}Wonderful.

167
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,826
{\an8}Your customers will not be disappointed.

168
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,929
{\an8}[exhales sharply]

00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,653
The reason I wanted us to meet:

676
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,198
That snow cone I licked at the game
gave me a wicked idea.

677
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,660
-But I need your help with it.
-"Wicked"? Do tell.

678
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,330
[Veronica] Try this.

679
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,336
Yum.

680
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,963
What is this delightsome elixir?

681
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,256
It's my rum...

682
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,801
mixed with your maple syrup.

683
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,430
It tastes like... breakfast on the beach.

684
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,682
No, Cheryl.

685
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,935
It tastes like money.

686
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,942
I'm very pleased you came around, Betty.

687
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,819
Very pleased, indeed. This...

688
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,738
is a stellar article.

689
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,241
It's great press for our school,
even though we lost.

690
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,871
We may have lost the game,
but we haven't lost the war.

691
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,083
I've been doing more and more research
on Stonewall Prep.

692
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,378
And did you know that they have
a world-class quiz team?

693
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,672
And the captain of that team
is none other than

694
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:47,176
athlete-scholar-scumbag
Bret Weston Wallis?

695
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,178
Yes.

696
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,974
But that championship is only a few weeks
away and Riverdale doesn't even...

697
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,603
have a team.

698
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,440
Miss Cooper...

699
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,943
are you volunteering?

700
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:09,573
Because I would love to get my hands
on at least one trophy this year.

701
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:11,784
Principal Honey...

702
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:17,373
at this point in time,
there is nothing that I would enjoy more

703
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,084
than to give Stonewall Prep
a royal ass-kicking.

704
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,461
[exhales sharply]

705
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,007
Then you have my full support, captain.

706
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,594
[breathes deeply]

707
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,600
[Jughead] Dad?

708
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,061
What's going on?

709
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,356
I felt it only appropriate
that your father be here

710
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,732
to celebrate with us.

711
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:44,942
Celebrate what?

712
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:49,196
You'll be receiving official word
by the end of next week, but, uh--

713
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,698
You got into Yale, boy.

714
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,869
Yeah. First Jones to go to college.

715
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,996
And an Ivy League one at that. Here.

716
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,582
I don't understand.

717
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:01,876
To Jughead.

718
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,587
And to Bret, as well.

719
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,883
Yeah, I got into Yale, too.
And who knows...

720
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,760
maybe if we're lucky,
we'll be roomies again.

721
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,400
Save your tears.

722
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,486
No one's watching.

723
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,448
Bret.

724
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,241
You got your wish, Ponytail.

725
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,244
Forsythe isn't going to Yale.

726
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,956
So I guess it'll just be
you and me in New Haven.
