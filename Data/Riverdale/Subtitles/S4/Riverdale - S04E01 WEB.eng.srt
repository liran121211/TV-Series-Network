[Jughead] <i>It's been a quiet few months</i>

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:18,018
<i>Spring slid into summer,</i>

00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:24,274
<i>The terrors of the Farm weren't forgotten,</i>

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,988
<i>Gryphons and Gargoyles was already</i>
<i>becoming the stuff of suburban legend.</i>

5
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,743
<i>Indeed, the big topic of conversation</i>
<i>around town was July 4th.</i>

6
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,954
<i>After some debate, it was decided</i>

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,665
<i>that there would be an Independence Day</i>
<i>parade down Main Street,</i>

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,293
<i>Riverdale's first in three years.</i>

9
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,922
<i>But there would be no fireworks display</i>

00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>The Blossoms used to sponsor them,</i>

11
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,761

<i>the town couldn't afford them.</i>

12
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,724
<i>Like I said...</i>

13
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,102

It's beautiful.

00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,862
-It's a beautiful story, Jug.
-Really?

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,656
You think it's worth submitting
to the contest?

17
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,367
No, I think it's gonna win the contest.

18
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,369
I love you.

19
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,662

I would.

24
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,053
But don't we have to finish building a
float for your big Fourth of July parade?

25
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,848
It's not my parade, it's the town's.
Pop's is only sponsoring it.

Well, if not the day...

-What's your problem, Cheryl?
-My problem, Veronica,

47
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:52,005
is that the Fourth of July
is a day of tragedy for Riverdale,

not celebration.

49
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,676
Or have you forgotten what happened
to my poor brother Jason.

Cheryl, Riverdale hasn't held a parade
out of respect

in... like, years.

our last summer to do this

we'll be getting ready to go to college.

Fred was... driving home to Riverdale
when he...

He pulled over to help someone whose car
had stalled on the side of the road and...

78
00:04:55,211 --> 00:05:00,341
another vehicle... came up on them
way too fast and-- And--

So, it was a hit-and-run.

We have to find out who did it.
We have to catch them.

[FP] No, Red.

You don't even think about that right now.

90

I'll work with the sheriff's office
up in Cherry Creek

You understand?

There's a plot next to his father,
Artie Andrews. Arthur Andrews.

96
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,141
Since we're transporting the body
from upstate,

97
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,811
there will be an additional cost
of $9,000.

98

Whatever needs to be done.
However much it costs.

99

The driver that makes these trips for us
isn't available until July 5th

100

because of the holiday.

101
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,034
Then we'll have the internment on the 6th,
if that's all right.

Hey. You remember that tree house
your dad helped us build?

-You mean the one he built for us?
-I remember you fell out of it, Reg.

And broke my arm.

105
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,006
Your dad drove me to the hospital.

[Reggie chuckles]

107
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,301
I remember this one time...

108
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,765
This time, we were having a picnic

109
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,102
when we were still in grade school
in Pickens Park,

110
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:39,107
and there was a father-daughter
potato-sack race.

111
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,818
My dad...

112
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:48,533
I don't know where he was, but Mr. Andrews
said that he would do it with me.

113
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,622
So, he was-- He was my dad for the day.

114
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,794
When things started getting bad
with my dad and drinking,

115
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,674
my mom would call up Fred... for help.

116
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,468
And he would drive to the bar,

117
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,888
and he would pick up my dad
and he'd lay him on the couch.

118
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,812
But he'd always stay a little while.
Just to talk to me.

119
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:24,193
To see how I was doing in school
and... if I had eaten dinner.

120
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,614
He just wanted to know if I was hungry.

121
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,117
I always was.

122
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,621
Your dad was such a gentleman, Archie.

123
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,123
He was the best.

124
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,710
He built and donated all the sets
for the musicals.

You don't have to, but...

126

I remember going to...

128
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,976
Going to Sears with him.
Just so I could ride the tractors.

129
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,319
He taught me everything.

130
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:13,159
Taught me how to play football
and baseball.

00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,694
{\an8}Hello?

174
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,071
{\an8}What happened to my dad's truck?

175
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,782
{\an8}It's still at the accident site,
parked on the side of the road.

176
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,452
{\an8}Okay.
Would you mind showing me where that is?

177
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,584
{\an8}It's a few miles south on Route 80.

178
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,295
{\an8}Right about... here.

179
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,299
{\an8}The keys are with the rest of your
father's belonging's at the funeral home.

180
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,508
{\an8}Okay.

181
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,845
{\an8}That was them, actually.
They're ready for us.

182
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,390
{\an8}-Thank you, deputy.
-Of course.

183
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,267
{\an8}You hang in there, okay?

184
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,145
{\an8}Thank you.

185
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,192
{\an8}Hi. Good morning.

186
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,986
{\an8}I'm Veronica Lodge. We just spoke.

187
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,323
{\an8}-This is Archie Andrews. He's--
-I'm Fred Andrews' son.

188
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,117
{\an8}Yes. Of course. My condolences.

189
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,119
How can I help you, Mr. Andrews?

190
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,997
{\an8}I wanna bring my dad home.

191
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,668
{\an8}It was my understanding

192
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,630
{\an8}the deceased would be transported
to Riverdale on the 5th.

193
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,757
{\an8}I know. It's-- It's not right. I--

194
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,134
{\an8}I want him home.

195
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,554
{\an8}And I wanna be the one
who brings him home, today.

196
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,684
{\an8}I understand.
But I'm afraid that's not possible.

197
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,439
[telephone rings]

198
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,275
-Hello?
-[Archie] <i>Hey, Mom.</i>

199
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,362
<i>Archie?</i>
<i>Aren't you upstairs in your bedroom?</i>

200
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,865
No, I'm in Cherry Creek.
I came up to pick up Dad.

201
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,824
What?

202
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,535
I'm sorry, I didn't think.

203
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,538
<i>The funeral home up here</i>
<i>won't release Dad to me.</i>

204
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,666
Something about me being underage.

205
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:55,876
Please.

206
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,046
I really don't wanna leave Dad here.

207
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,840
Put me on the phone
with whoever's in charge.

208
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,347
I see.

209
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,767
No, that won't be necessary, Mrs. Andrews.

210
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,773
Of course. I'll just need you
to sign an authorization form and--

211
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,859
Nope. I'll do it right now.

212
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,610
Thank you.

213
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,199
I'll just go
get your father's personal effects, then.

214
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,578
-There was a set of truck keys.
-They're in there.

215
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,708
I'm going to need two to three hours
to get him ready for transport.

216
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,544
You can wait here
or you can come back at noon.

217
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,004
Can I see him?

218
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,841
Archie, you don't have to.

219
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,176
What if they made a mistake, you guys?

220
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,931
-I'd like to see my father.
-Of course.

221
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,560
He's just in the next room,
if you'd like to follow me.

222
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,337
Archie.

223
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,557
I thought--

224
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,267
Archie changed his mind.

225
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,395
But he asked us to make sure it's him.

226
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,848
-Jug, one thing you can help me with:
-Anything.

227
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,725
My dad's obituary.

228
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,688
Could you write it? For the <i>Register?</i>

229
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:21,981
Of course.

230
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,157
Is it him?

231
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,079
Yes. It is.

232
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,666
I have his belongings.

233
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,503
Are you sure?

234
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,424
Yeah, Arch.

235
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,677
It's your dad.

236
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:06,150
Mrs. Andrews, we heard the news,
and we're so, so sorry about Mr. Andrews.

237
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,526
Thank you.

238
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,320
Mrs. Andrews.

239
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,493
When my brother Jason died,
I felt supremely alone.

240
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,583
My world was only darkness and despair.

241
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,630
I don't want you or Archie to ever feel
anything even remotely like that.

242
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,094
So... with your blessing,

243
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,931
there's something I'd like to do
for your family.

244
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,142
For when Archie returns.

245
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,309
[car approaches]

246
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,994
Can we help you?

247
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,916
No, I'm just paying my respects.

248
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,501
How do you know what happened here?

249
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:33,755
Wait, are--?

250
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,591
Are you Archie?

251
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,010
How do you know my name?

252
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,346
Your father told me.

253
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:51,773
One of my tires blew,
and... I was stranded out here.

254
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,278
You're the one he was helping.

255
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,244
[sobs] I mean, cars just--
You know, they kept...

256
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,707
They kept whizzing by.
Nobody would stop, but your dad did.

257
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,297
He talked about you the entire time.

258
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,509
His-- His son.

259
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:20,802
How...

260
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,390
he couldn't believe a man like him was
blessed with such a thoughtful, kind boy.

261
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,435
You were with him when he...?

262
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,146
We were working on the tire.

263
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,399
And a car just...

264
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,903
It came out of nowhere.
It-- Speeding, and...

265
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,075
I'm sorry, I just...

266
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,328
I froze in its path,
and your dad, he just--

267
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,664
He pushed me out of the way.

268
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,418
He saved my life.

269
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:55,921
And...

270
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,175
if he hadn't done what he did,

271
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,511
there's no way that I would be here
right now. I know that.

272
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,308
I am so sorry.

273
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,603
There's nothing I can do
to ever repay him, but--

274
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,526
But I would like to say a prayer for him.

275
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,698
Maybe you'd like to join me?

276
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:38,213
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

277
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:44,636
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

278
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,723
Give us this day our daily bread...

279
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,892
and forgive us for our trespasses...

280
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,356
as we forgive those...
who trespass against us.

281
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,445
Lead us not to temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

282
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:07,367
For thine is the kingdom, the power,
the glory, forever and ever.

283
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:08,910
Amen.

00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,098
A total stranger.

288
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,561
And he sacrificed himself for her.

289

That's an incredible thing, Archie.

290
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,860
He died a hero.

291
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,862
Why did he have to be one?

292
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,532
Why this time?
Why c-- Why did he have to stop?

293
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,618
Why couldn't he have kept driving
like everyone else?

294
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,745
Because your dad helped people.

295
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,917
-That's just who he was.
-Yeah, and it got him killed.

296
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,463
I mean, he died on the side of the road.

297
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,551
Waiting for an ambulance,
without his family, without his friends.

298
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,597
I'm sorry, but that's not heroic, that's--

299
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:12,891
That's senseless.

300
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:16,561
I promise you... that is not true.

301
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,608

-I'm just going outside. Need some air.

Who is he, Mr. Jones?

308
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,898
His name's George Augustine.
He lives in Cherry Creek. No priors.

309
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,568
-Is he in jail?
<i>-No, he...</i>

310
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,238
-He made bail. He was released.
<i>-What? He's out?</i>

311
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,032
He should be rotting in a cell, Mr. Jones.

He will be, but this is how it works.

the guy's real broken up about it, so...

with all these fireworks.
