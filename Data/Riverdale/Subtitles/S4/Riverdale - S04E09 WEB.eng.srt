2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,846
Do you see those people over there?
They're Dodger's family.

3
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,516
I'm not sure what you're here for,
but you and your boys need to leave.

4
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,393
We've got kids here.
We don't want any trouble.

5
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,937
Mr. DuPont, the first book
in the Baxter Brothers series

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,814
was written by my grandfather.

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,149
I killed Caramel.

8
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:25,650
[Kevin] No.

9
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:29,946
Betty, that wasn't you,
that was your deeply screwed-up dad.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,614
Someone is trying to drive me mad,

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,617
but once I find out
who this depraved monster is,

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,995
I will unleash
a wrath upon them so wicked,

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,831
they will wish they had been consumed
in their mother's womb.

14
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,499
You've reached the Riverdale Hotline.

15
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,878
If you wish to report a problem
in your neighborhood, leave a message.

16
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,505
Anonymity is your choice.
We're here to help.

[Jughead] "And as Buddy and Bobby Baxter
sat down at the dining room table,

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,179
exhausted and bruised,

19
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,014
they felt satisfaction.

20
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,017
The Case of the Boy in the River
had been solved.

21
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,936
Tomorrow, there would be another mystery,

22
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:06,274
but tonight,
their only concern was dinner."

23
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,988
Outstanding, Mr. Jones.

24
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,117
I believe the Baxter Brothers has found
their newest ghostwriter.

25
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,161
Wait, I won the contract?

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,081
-Like, right this second?
-That is correct.

27
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,207
Professor DuPont,

28
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,627
you can't actually believe that garbage
was better than my submission.

29
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,754
Oh, I can and I do.

30
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,715
Your contract, Mr. Jones.

31
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,718
Your first step into a larger,
better life.

32
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,179
Provided you play by the rules.

33
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,314
I don't understand.
Dartmouth was my safety school.

34
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,484
I guess you should've accepted
Harvard's invitation.

35
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,447
Nice try, Daddy, but I still have
my interview with Columbia.

36
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,324
Interview, huh?

37
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,535
Good luck with that.

38
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,079
Columbia's extremely competitive.

39
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:07,710
But I believe Riverdale Community College
has a rolling admission policy.

40
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,004
So, if you study there,

41
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,675
you could launch your rum empire,
if that's still happening.

42
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,468
Oh, it's happening, Daddy.

43
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,640
-[door closes]
-[FP] Hey. Wake up, Red.

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,311
Mr. Jones? What are you doing here?

45
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,065
Investigating a vigilante.
Now, be honest with me.

46
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,402
-Is that you?
-Yeah, it is.

47
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,113
-You're not gonna arrest me, are you?
-I should.

48
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,701
What the hell do you think you're doing?

49
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:44,122
Helping. People are too scared to call you
or the cops, so I set up a hotline.

50
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,584
What happens if you get hurt or worse?

51
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,670
People die changing tires
on the side of the road, Mr. Jones.

52
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:54,591
-At least I'd die with a shred of honor.
-[scoffs] What a load of smug BS.

53
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,217
You think that's gonna comfort your mom?

54
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,596
Why aren't you focused on the center,
protecting these kids?

55
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,807
I am, but trouble shows up here
about every other day.

56
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,102
Starting with the Dickensons,
who are still out there, by the way.

57
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:10,315
You're doing good work here, Red.
Here. Honorable work.

58
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,525
Maybe I can help you.

59
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,570
[Jughead] What do you say, Chuck?
Can you help me?

60
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,865
So, you want me to use FBI resources
to track down your...

61
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,703
Sorry, our grandfather.
Why the sudden urgency?

62
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,664
Well, look, it's probably something
I should've done months ago,

63
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,542
but I have an important decision to make,

64
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,544
and I can't until I know the truth,
his truth.

65
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,630
Can you help me?

66
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,465
[Veronica] <i>What's wrong, Pop?</i>

67
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,550
Our liquor licensed has been revoked.

68
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,970
As of Sunday, the speakeasy won't
be allowed to serve alcohol.

69
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,513
What? According to whom?

70
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,141
-The mayor's office.
-Figures.

71
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:50,188
This is payback for me vowing
to challenge Daddy's precious rum empire.

72
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,899
Long-term, we're fighting this injunction.

73
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,235
Short-term...

74
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:01,783
we're hosting a no-holds-barred blowout
at La Bonne Nuit before the boom falls.

75
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,702
No offense, Veronica,

76
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,789
but your father, he wasn't raised right.

77
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,044
Actually, he was.

78
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,923
And you've just given me a great idea.

What? What's happening?

82
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,309
Honey, it's your sister.
She mutilated a nurse at Shady Grove.

83
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,978
She almost clawed her face off.

[Betty] <i>Maybe this is a mistake.</i>

85
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,110
Polly's messed up,
but she's not a literal monster.

86
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,446
This is security footage from Shady Grove.

87
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,831
Okay. Polly's sitting there, looking like
a zombie, but she's not hurt--

88
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,215
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

89
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,760
What the hell happened?
She attacked that nurse for no reason.

90
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,097
She'll only talk to you, she says.
And alone.

91
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,266
Okay. Well, then I'll go talk to her.

92
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,101
First, there's one more thing
you should know.

93
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,353
The nurse that Polly disfigured...

94
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,564
her name is Betty.

95
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,901
[Betty] <i>I heard you wanted to speak to me.</i>

96
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,779
Betty. Oh, thank God.

97

You're the only one I can trust.

98
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,409
Can you tell me what's going on?

99
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,872
Polly, can you tell me what's going on?
You attacked a nurse named Betty.

100
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,206
That's impossible!

101
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,585
I can't remember
any of what they're saying.

102
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,046
I was in the rec room,
and the next thing I remember,

103
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,214
I'm in here and I'm chained to this bed.

104
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,549
Please, Betty.

105
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,177
You have to believe me. Betty, please.

106
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,263
{\an8}I didn't do this. Please believe me.

107
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,224
I didn't do it, Betty. I didn't do it.
It wasn't me.

168
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,176
What a surprise. When did you get here?

169
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,220
[speaks in Spanish]

170
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:19,559
{\an8}You should be ashamed of yourself.
Picking fights with your daughter.

171
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,853
{\an8}Your father is turning over in his grave.

172
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,281
Really? Turning my own mother against me?

173
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,032
Oh!

174
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,118
And guess what she shared with me.

175
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,204
Our family's secret rum recipe.

176
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,459
So, brace yourself, Daddy, it's on.

177
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,506
[Mary] <i>Archie, I need for you</i>
<i>to sit down for this.</i>

178
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,304
Vic, your dad's foreman,
came by earlier today.

179
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,807
And he wants to buy us out
of Andrews Construction.

180
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,893
Well, tough, Mom,
'cause we're not selling<i>.</i>

181
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,479
And I'll tell Vic that myself
right after I fire his ass.

182
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,442
-Toby, now's not a good time.
<i>-It's about Eddie.</i>

183
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,944
<i>He and Malcolm went looking for Dodger</i>
<i>and his brothers.</i>

184
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,280
<i>-And they found them.</i>
-What? Where are they?

185
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:18,826
<i>They're beat up, Archie, bad.</i>
<i>Eddie's in the hospital... again.</i>

186
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,081
-[Betty] <i>What'd you find out, Charles?</i>
<i>-Our hunch was right.</i>

187
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,919
The calls received by Polly and Alice came
from the same place:

188
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,879
Shankshaw Prison.

189
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,966
Charles, something must have been said
on those calls

190
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,094
that made Mom and Polly enter
a trancelike state

191
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,347
that turned them into deranged killers...

192
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,433
-as if they were hypnotized.
-I thought the same thing.

193
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,312
And who do we know
that uses auditory cues and hypnotism

194
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,481
to control its members? The Farm.

195
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,608
Edgar may be dead,

196
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,152
but his lovesick lackey Evelyn sure isn't.

197
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,362
She's in prison.

198
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,406
Any chance that prison is Shankshaw?

199
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,088
You hold it right there, boy.

200
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,174
Now, you are trespassing
on private property.

201
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,636
You're Forsythe Jones I,
and I'm your grandson.

202
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,310
I-- I-- I guess you better come in, then.

203
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,235
Jason.

204
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,237
Julian.

205
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,281
Thank you for joining me, brothers.

206
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,618
The day has finally come.

207
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,454
I'm ending our collective misery today.

208
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,457
{\an8}The Chernobyl-grade roach bombs
I've set up throughout Thistlehouse

209
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,542
are discharging a toxin

210
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,253
strong enough to kill anything
that crawls within these walls.

211
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,465
I was born in poison...

212
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,178
and I shall die in poison.

213
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,355
[coughing]

214
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,404
Mumzie.

215
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,489
What a surprise.

216
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,414
Whatever your dad said about me...

217
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,833
is probably true.

218
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,254
I'm actually not here
to talk about that... yet.

219
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,342
I'm here to talk about
one of your old classmates.

220
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,511
Francis DuPont.

221
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,556
Oh, I remember Francis, all right.

222
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,101
Look, I think you wrote
the original Baxter Brothers book,

223
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,603
not DuPont.

224
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:55,149
I think he stole your idea
and then he published it under his name.

225
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,693
Well, you got it all figured out,
haven't you, boy?

226
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,738
Except your facts are a little mixed up.

227
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,451
Why don't you help me sort them out?

228
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,704
Eddie and Malcolm are in the hospital.

229
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,290
Munroe is with them.
They went after the Dickenson brothers.

230
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,667
Bill and Fagan beat the living hell
out of those kids.

231
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,085
I'm not gonna let that go.

232
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,003
All right.

233
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,796
All right, then.

234
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,508
Your dad would pound the tar out of me

235
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,468
if I let you do this on your own,
but this is it.

236
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,136
We handle these Dickenson boys

237
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,097
and then you're putting
this vigilante business to bed. All of it.

238
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,307
If I agree...

239
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,434
will you help me?

240
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,186
Yeah.

241
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,564
Just let me get changed first.

242
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,445
[man] That'll do.

243
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,738
All right, I'll take it.

244
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,577
Well, lookie here.

245
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,997
Bill and Fagan Dickenson.
You guys are the scum of the earth.

246
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,041
Going after kids.

247
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,759
[FP] Big men, huh? Beating up teenagers.

248
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,764
Let's see how you do
against someone your own size.

249
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,851
-I'll break your bones, old man.
-Not before we break yours.

250
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,024
[Cheryl] <i>Time to rise and shine,</i>
<i>Mother dear.</i>

251
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,109
[coughs]

252
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,365
Cheryl?

253
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:27,950
What--?

254
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,161
Did you really think
I was gassing myself to an early grave?

255
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,998
No. That was a ruse.

256
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,125
But riddle me this, Mumzie.

257
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,628
Do you remember when I was a little girl

258
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,131
and you used to read me
<i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?</i>

259
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,592
Cheryl, you release me this minute!

260
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,385
You would ask me if I thought I was Alice.

261
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,431
And I would say,
"No, Mother. I'm the Red Queen."

262
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,270
So, as the Red Queen did to Alice,
I am putting you on trial.

263
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,187
[snickers]

264
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,981
Lunatic child.

265
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,901
What are the charges?

266
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,235
They are as follows:

267
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,031
Prolonged gaslighting in hopes
of driving me cuckoo bananas,

268
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,910
attempted murder of Archie, Betty,
Veronica and Jughead,

269
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,413
and actual murder of my father,
Clifford Blossom,

270
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,917
Claudius Blossom and Hal Cooper,
among others.

271
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,754
How do you plead, Mother most foul?

272
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,634
I gotta say...

273
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,637
that felt good.

274
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,848
Yeah? We kicked ass, Mr. Jones.

275
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,933
Mm-hm.

276
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:39,730
It's been a while since these fists
delivered some proper street justice.

277
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,651
And the old jacket still fits
like a glove.

278
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:49,073
And your old man, he's looking down on us
probably shaking his head but...

279
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:51,992
still...

280
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,915
He'd be glad
your crime-fighting days are over.

281
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,338
And I always loved detective stories,
so, uh...

282
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:09,426
I come up with this notion to write a book
about teenage detectives.

283
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,096
Right, the Baxter Brothers.
So, how did DuPont steal it from you?

284
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,515
No, no. You're getting ahead
of the story here.

285
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,685
You see, I was burning out at Stonewall,

286
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,436
so, uh, I quit.

287
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:26,527
And the only thing I had to show for it
all was this one Baxter Brothers story.

288
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,029
I didn't know what to do with it.

289
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,699
Francis said he did.
He offered to buy it from me.

290
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,700
How much?

291
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,578
-Five thousand dollars.
-Five thousand dollars?

292
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,164
That franchise is worth millions now.

293
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,377
Over the years, when I saw how popular
the Baxter Brothers became, I grew bitter.

294
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,673
Started drinking,
took my anger out on the world and...

295
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,592
on my son.

296
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,555
Eventually, I figured it'd be best
for all concerned if I just--

297
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,557
Went out for cigarettes
and didn't come back?

298
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,641
Yeah.

299
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,814
Mr. DuPont asked me
to be the next ghostwriter.

300
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,315
Is that a fact?

301
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,568
All this time, I...

302
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,364
I had thought
that Mr. DuPont was killing people

303
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,742
in order to keep the secret
that he stole the book from you.

304
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,661
[chuckles] That's quite
the theory there, boy.

305
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,081
If that was the case,
he would've killed me, too, wouldn't he?

306
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,876
Yeah. Yes.

307
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,627
Word of advice for you:

308
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,464
I messed up my life.

309
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,216
I messed up your father's life.

310
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,638
You seize the opportunities
you're being given.

311
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,101
Took you long enough.

312
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,229
You weaponized my family against me

313
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:48,901
by calling them and triggering
some post-hypnotic suggestion.

314
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,361
What's the directive?

315
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,698
How exactly are you getting
your sleeper cells to turn?

316
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:59,411
When I deliver the activation,
the receiver turns into you.

317
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,038
What the hell does that mean?

318
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,831
They become Betty.

319
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,961
As in Betty Cooper. As in... you.

320
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:12,007
Why did Polly attack a nurse named Betty?
Why did my mom come after me?

321
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:17,262
When triggered, they become Betty.
They try to kill Dark Betty, Evil Betty,

322
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,597
Other Betty.

323
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,101
You mean, they try to murder me.

324
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,644
Elegant, isn't it?

325
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,815
It was Edgar's idea.

326
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,693
When they hear the trigger word,
they become you,

327
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,737
and therefore try to kill you.

328
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,280
You're a psycho.

329
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:36,907
[Evelyn] Mm-hm.

330
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,661
So, what exactly is the trigger word,
Evelyn?

331
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,081
Tangerine.

332
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,834
Repeated three times in a row.

333
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,463
Tangerine.

334
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,800
Tangerine.

335
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,595
Tan--

336
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,146
What do you say we call it a night, Red?

337
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,524
You need a ride back to the center?

338
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,027
Mr. Jones.

339
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,279

Hey.

It'll take a whole lot more
than a flesh wound

346
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,471
for me to regret what we did tonight.

347
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,141
-It was Dodger Dickenson.
-No, we don't know that.

348
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,309
Yeah, we do.

349
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,478
Word on the street, it was Dodger
and his crazy-ass mom, Darla.

350
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,315
That it was a parting shot
before the Dickensons get out of town.

351
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,775
-So, they're still in Riverdale?
-Yep, loading out the arcade.

352

your damn mouth shut, Fangs?

You're already on thin ice with me.
And don't even think about it, Red.

354

You agreed to hang it up for good.

They're leaving town. Archie!

I left before she could say it
a third time,

358
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,755
but what the hell would happen
if I heard the trigger word three times?

359
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,175
Would I be activated
and wanna kill myself?

360
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,551
One way to find out.

for a reason to kill me, Cheryl.

despite your wicked machinations,

374
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,513
I'm looking for a reason
to spare your life.

375
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,848
You're my mother.

376
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,310
And yet,
you've always been so cruel to me.

377

For why?

378
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,069
You brutalized me my entire life,

379
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,280
you tried to kill my friends,

380
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,532
and then you hid in Thistlehouse
to keep torturing me.

381
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,912
You saw me happy with Toni
and you couldn't let that be, could you?

382
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,875
It wasn't your happiness
with the she-goblin

383

that I wanted to destroy.

384
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,088
It was your happiness with Jason.

385
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:43,802
How can I live knowing
that you are happy with my dead son?

386

You don't get what I can't have!

387
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,392
In that case, Mumzie...

388
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,104
you're guilty of the worst crime of all:

389
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,566
being hateful to your rotten core.

390
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,403
Hm. So, there, you've condemned me.

391
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,823
Execute me, then.

392
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,909

-And he knows that he was a bad father.
-Yeah, that he was.

00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:00,882
Hello, Mumzie.

511
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,883
Cheryl?

512
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,804
What is this?

513
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,097
I trust you approve of this bunker.

514
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,559
After all, it's larger than the cell
you would've gotten at Shankshaw.

515
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,270
With food, electricity, plumbing.

516
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,981
You wretched child. You can't keep me...

517
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,609
On the contrary, Mother.

518
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,906
You need time and solitude to seek
penance for your crimes and cruelty.

519
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,117
-Toodles.
-Cheryl. Cheryl?

520
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,245
Cheryl!

521
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,711
[Betty] <i>It was terrifying, Charles.</i>

522
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,132
When I saw the red door, I... fugued.

523
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,469
I slipped into a trance. Why?

524
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,889
It may be a combination
of hearing the trigger earlier

525
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,683
and then returning to a familiar setting.

526
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,935
What I saw...

527
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,689
me about to kill Caramel...

528
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,027
I think that's when
the dark part of me was born.

529
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,239
If that's true,
if you can go back to the moment

530
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,825
of Dark Betty's birth
and stop it from happening...

531
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,702
you'll essentially be--

532
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,705
Killing my shadow self
before she was even born.

533
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:15,832
Will you try it?

534
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,086
Yeah.

535
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,217
Tangerine. Tangerine.

536
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,468
Tangerine.

537
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,005
[Betty] Wait.

538
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,507
Let me take that from you.

539
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,677
But what am I gonna do now?

540
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,387
You can go play.

541
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,723
Really? I can go and play?

542
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,684
Yeah, go ahead.

543
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,853
Thank you.

544
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:33,701
Betty.

545
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:40,249
I'm-- I'm not sure, but I think I did it.

546
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,335
Well, that's great news.

547
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,670
You're all right.

548
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:45,797
You're okay now.

549
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,219
I'm sorry I kept you waiting,
Ms. Rutherford.

550
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,766
I'm guessing my shot at Columbia
is pretty much blown.

551
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,143
Not necessarily.

552
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:03,022
At Columbia, we're always looking
for people with good stories.

553
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:08,486
I don't know what happened here tonight,
but I'll bet it's a good story.

554
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,739
It is, indeed.

555
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,409
Well, how about you tell it to me?

556
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:29,924
[Toni] <i>Babe, are you okay?</i>

557
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,844
Are you having second thoughts
about your mom?

558
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,763
No, but...

559
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,685
I was ruminating that perhaps...

560
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,399
it's time to bury Jason.

561
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,529
Cheryl, are you sure?

562
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,580
Yes.

563
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,005
There's been so much pain and poison
in this house.

564
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,967
And Jason, more than any of us...

565
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,930
deserves the peace
my mother spent years denying me.

566
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,183
[Mary] <i>Archie?</i>

567
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,060
<i>What's going on, honey?</i>

568
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,312
Why are you sitting in the dark?

569
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,400
What happened?

570
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,736
Who did this to you?

571
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,322
I did.

572
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,909
I did it to me, Mom.

573
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,370
The Dickensons were leaving town.

574
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,081
They were done with Riverdale.

575
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,500
But I wanted to hurt them, to hurt Dodger.

576
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,838
-Maybe even kill him.
-Archie.

577
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,884
It doesn't make any sense to me, Mom.

578
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,595
How predators like Dodger get to live...

579
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,933
but Dad, he...

580
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,650
The worst part about it is some
of the kids from the center were there

581
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,902
and they saw me standing over him, angry.

582
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,696
Bloody.

583
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,407
-Like a monster.
-No.

584
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,827
You're not a monster.

585
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,787
You're just...

586
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,580
still hurting.

587
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,792
When will this end, Mom?

588
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,839
How does this end?

589
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,302
I've never felt further from Dad
than I do now.

590
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,448
Let me guess,
my old man didn't wanna come?

591
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,576
No.

592
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,411
He ran away.

593
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,415
I'm so sorry.

594
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,379
I feel like a fool.

595
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,381
No, you're not.

596
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,553
You would be
if you turned down that contract, though.

597
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,764
No, I'm signing it.

598
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,732
I think it's time to let go of the past.

599
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,727
Evening, Forsythe.

600
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,904
Uh...

601
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,949
This is the part where you kill me?

602
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,576
No, you ass.

603
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,666
It's an initiation.

604
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,791
Welcome to the Quill and Skull Society,
Jones.

605
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,131
[cell phone buzzing]

606
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:26,971
Cheryl, what's up?

607
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,853
[Cheryl] Thank you all for coming.

608
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,480
You all were here
last time I was at this river.

609
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,066
When I tried to take my own life.

610
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,821
It's only fitting that you're here now...

611
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,615
with my beloved Toni...

612
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,868
as I give Jason...

613
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,245
at long last...

614
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,498
the funeral he deserves.

615
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:12,892
[sobs]

616
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,136
He was a good brother, Toni.

617
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,934
I wish you could've met him for real.

618
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:56,977
I know.

619
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,106
[microwave beeps]

620
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,069
[door opens]

621
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,581
Yeah? Can I help you?

622
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,000
Archie? Archie Andrews?

623
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,336
I am.

624
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,046
It's good to see you, son.

625
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,090
My name's Frank.

626
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,342
I'm, uh...

627
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,345
I'm your dad's brother.

628
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,207
Tangerine.

629
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,419
Tangerine.

630
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,088
[glass shatters]

631
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,131
Betty?

632
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,049
Honey?

633
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,342
What happened?

634
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,140
I wanted to make sure that it was gone.

635
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,101
The dark part of myself.

636
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,313
And it was.

637
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,295
He's dead.

638
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,464
What did you do, Betty?
