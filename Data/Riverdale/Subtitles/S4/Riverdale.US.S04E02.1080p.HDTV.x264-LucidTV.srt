1
00:00:02,353 --> 00:00:03,819
The Farm left me.

2
00:00:03,854 --> 00:00:05,287
The worthy ascended.

3
00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:06,822
Where's my mom and Polly?

4
00:00:06,857 --> 00:00:08,057
Gone. Everyone is.

5
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:10,943
I'm Charles, your brother.

6
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:12,778
It's vital that
we find your mom ASAP.

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,496
Is there anything
we can do to help?

8
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:15,664
Thought you might ask.

9
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,865
Welcome home, Jay-Jay.

10
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:19,368
We want your father, not you.

11
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:20,919
Understood, Agent Ardelia.

12
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,421
You're under arrest.

13
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:23,672
For what?

14
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,959
For conducting illegal activities
at your establishments.

15
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:30,129
Hermione Lodge, you're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder.

16
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:31,463
Your own husband's.

17
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:34,249
This is what I got when I asked
my dad about that stupid game.

18
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:36,613
I've been thinking about making
some changes to this place, Mad Dog.

19
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,271
- I want you to help me run it.
- Oh, yeah.

20
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,640
<i>Fred Andrews will always
be a part of Riverdale.</i>

21
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:43,025
<i>I love you so much, Dad.</i>

22
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:47,646
<i>After Mr. Andrews' funeral,</i>

23
00:00:47,698 --> 00:00:50,282
<i>the rest of summer vacation
passed in a surreal haze.</i>

24
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:55,904
<i>Betty, Veronica, and I spent as
much time as we could with Archie.</i>

25
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,992
<i>We had dinner
at Pop's every night.</i>

26
00:01:00,044 --> 00:01:03,278
<i>And every day you could tell he
was getting better and better.</i>

27
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,664
<i>I'm not saying
he wasn't still heartbroken,</i>

28
00:01:05,716 --> 00:01:07,132
<i>the entire town was,</i>

29
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:09,051
<i>but my pal Archie's a fighter.</i>

30
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:11,787
<i>And by the last day
of summer vacation,</i>

31
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:15,307
<i>while the football field was
being mowed for the new season,</i>

32
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:18,894
<i>and the school floors
were being buffed to a shine,</i>

33
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:20,345
<i>and banners for the first dance</i>

34
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:21,847
<i>of the year were being hung,</i>

35
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:23,932
<i>Archie was doing
what he does best.</i>

36
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,602
You know, Mad Dog,
I was thinking.

37
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:28,020
School starts tomorrow.

38
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,606
What if you came with me?

39
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,409
Why would I do that?

40
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:35,765
I don't know,
to get your diploma.

41
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:38,247
Don't you want it?

42
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,482
Hell yeah.

43
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,618
Okay, then this is your chance.

44
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:44,536
Isn't your younger brother
gonna be a freshman?

45
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:46,088
I don't know, Red.

46
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:47,756
After everything
I've lived through,

47
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:50,259
I don't think going back to
textbooks and cafeteria politics

48
00:01:50,294 --> 00:01:53,178
- is really my scene.
- Yeah. It's not mine either.

49
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:56,665
But getting that diploma is what my
dad wanted, so I'm going to do it.

50
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,884
Look, all I'm saying is,
we could do it together.

51
00:01:58,936 --> 00:02:00,580
Hell, you could even
try out for the Bulldogs.

52
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:02,104
Ooh, a little pigskin.

53
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,871
<i>So, Mom missed
another check-in with you?</i>

54
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:07,276
Yes.

55
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:09,027
But like I said, don't panic.

56
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:11,157
This isn't the first time she's
been late with the reports.

57
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:12,564
Well, Charles,

58
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,783
what if that means
she's been found out?

59
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,952
Listen, until she contacts us,

60
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:19,371
you should just focus on
being a high school student.

61
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,766
I'll reach out
if anything changes.

62
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,377
Now that your parents'
court date has been set,

63
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,212
you need to make a decision.

64
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:31,533
Are you testifying on behalf of your
mother? Or your father? Or both?

65
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,569
Or neither.

66
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,369
I can be Switzerland.

67
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,473
At the very minimum, I recommend

68
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:40,225
you issue
a statement of support.

69
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,710
The press will want to know
where you stand with...

70
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,095
No comment.

71
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:44,813
That's my statement.

72
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:46,548
Now if you'll
excuse me, Mr. Sowerberry,

73
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,927
I have some last-minute school
supply shopping I need to do.

74
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:52,020
<i>Well, Jay-Jay,</i>

75
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:53,689
which one for
the first day of school?

76
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,558
Rebellious white after Labor Day

77
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,527
or my signature red?

78
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,281
I agree 100%.

79
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,178
<i>You know, I really can't imagine</i>

80
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:08,537
a better way to spend our
last night of summer vacation.

81
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:10,572
Isn't it crazy?

82
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:14,042
In just nine months,
life as we know it will be over.

83
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:15,294
No more high school.

84
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:16,879
No more<i> Blue and Gold.</i>

85
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:20,465
No more heart-to-hearts
at the lockers.

86
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:22,751
Oh, B, don't be sad.

87
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,586
I'm sorry, guys.

88
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,923
I can't help but think
life goes by so fast.

89
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:31,727
And none of us are very good
at stopping to savor it.

90
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:35,697
But tonight, we will be.

91
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:36,733
Mmm-hmm.

92
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:42,154
I think
that's our cue, Archiekins.

93
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,276
- Archie?
- Hmm?

94
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:55,694
I forgot to set the alarm.
Get up.

95
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:56,729
We're gonna be late.

96
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,184
- You guys, wake up.
- Hmm?

97
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,988
We're gonna be late for the first
day of senior year. Hurry up.

98
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:07,039
Oh, my God.

99
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:20,635
- You're late.
-

100
00:05:21,872 --> 00:05:22,921
And you are?

101
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:25,841
I'm Principal Weatherbee's
replacement, Mr. Honey.

102
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:29,594
We apologize for the tardiness,

103
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:31,179
Mr. Honey,
it won't happen again.

104
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,732
I don't know what kind of a ship

105
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,184
Waldo Weatherbee
was running around here,

106
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,831
but things are going to be
different this year.

107
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:38,987
We'll have order.

108
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,690
Discipline.

109
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,357
Consequences.

110
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:44,910
Now get out of my sight.

111
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:56,455
Okay, he sets up
the bubble screen for you,

112
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:57,507
you catch...

113
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:58,590
Bam!

114
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,791
- You run like hell.
- Hmm.

115
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:01,510
You're one of the fastest
we got, Mantle.

116
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:02,761
Coach...

117
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,913
Any chance we can make room
for one more Bulldog?

118
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,465
Well, lineup's pretty much set.

119
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:08,216
- You looking to play?
- Definitely.

120
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:09,395
If you'll have me
on the team, sir.

121
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,469
So, what's your name?

122
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:11,553
Munroe.

123
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,055
Munroe Moore.

124
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,036
Come out to practice,
show us what you got.

125
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,526
For sure. I'll be there.

126
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:19,041
This is gonna be
the best season ever.

127
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:30,989
I'm not too late, am I?

128
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,658
To sign up for, uh...

129
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,790
I don't know, I was thinking,
maybe an arts reporter?

130
00:06:36,046 --> 00:06:37,046
Kevin...

131
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:38,781
Betty...

132
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,750
um, I'm also here because...

133
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,387
I've been doing
a lot of work on myself,

134
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:47,973
ever since I was left behind
by the Farm,

135
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,591
and it's helped me
to realize that

136
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,927
I don't...
I don't need the Farm...

137
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:54,563
to make me feel whole, but I...

138
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:56,431
I do need my friends.

139
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:58,266
Especially my former
best friend.

140
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:01,437
I am...

141
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,488
so sorry

142
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:05,440
for the way I treated you

143
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:06,858
while I was under Edgar's spell.

144
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,309
Oh, you mean like

145
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,279
when you dragged me by my
ankles to get a lobotomy?

146
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,332
Yeah. I...

147
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:17,002
I'm most ashamed of that.

148
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,320
I hope that I can show you
how much I've changed.

149
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,039
And I hope...

150
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:24,626
that I prove to you
that you can trust me again.

151
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,379
Um, I...

152
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:29,881
I'm so, so sorry, Betty.

153
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,187
Just fill out
an application, Kev,

154
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,439
and then we'll see.

155
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,310
Jughead Jones,

156
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:44,863
please report
to the Principal's Office.

157
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,782
Jughead Jones
to the Principal's Office.

158
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:51,186
Am I in trouble again?

159
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:52,404
No.

160
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:54,355
In fact, you have a visitor.

161
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,458
I'm Mr. Chipping.
It's nice to meet you,

162
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:57,743
Jughead.

163
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:59,194
Nice to meet you, too.

164
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:03,331
Over the summer you submitted a
short story to a writing contest?

165
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,050
Yeah. I didn't win.

166
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,669
Yeah, I know.
I was one of the judges.

167
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,754
And I was very impressed
with your voice.

168
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:12,540
And while I couldn't
sway my fellow judges,

169
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,644
I can offer you an opportunity

170
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:17,062
to come study writing with me.

171
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:20,315
I am a teacher
at Stonewall Prep.

172
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,184
You want me to transfer to
Stonewall Prep?

173
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:24,385
It's a tremendous offer,
Mr. Jones.

174
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,071
I'm good.

175
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,773
But thank you for the visit
and for liking my story.

176
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:33,078
<i>My good news of the day is,</i>

177
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,363
Mrs. Burble said
I'm a shoo-in for Harvard.

178
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,999
I mean, obviously.

179
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:39,234
Damn.

180
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:41,753
I guess I better start looking
at community colleges in...

181
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,205
Where's Harvard?

182
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,122
- Veronica!
- Do you think your mother

183
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:45,551
really tried to have
your father killed?

184
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:46,541
- Back off.
- -Now that that the court dates have been set,

185
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:48,336
- whose side will you choose?
- Oh, hell, no.

186
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:52,764
I am not having
my senior year ruined

187
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,100
by a bunch of
bloodsucking paparazzi.

188
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,638
Screw it.

189
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,690
Archie...

190
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,975
So much for a quiet senior year.

191
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:19,741
Mr. Honey,
thank you for meeting with us.

192
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,577
I, Cheryl Blossom,
as Student Body President,

193
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,413
and Antoinette Topaz

194
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:26,832
as Acting Student Body
Vice-President,

195
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,501
would like to personally
welcome you to Riverdale High.

196
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:32,003
Thank you, ladies.

197
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,923
I was actually going to
reach out to you,

198
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,310
regarding that Back to School
Dance that you've organized.

199
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,312
It's canceled.

200
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,646
For why?

201
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,860
At the last student dance,
multiple students were murdered.

202
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,217
Yes.

203
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,886
But that's exactly why
we need this dance,

204
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:49,489
to heal.

205
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:51,089
Mr. Honey,

206
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,458
if I may speak
from personal experience,

207
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,596
the Back to School Dance,
after my brother Jason's death,

208
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,715
provided much needed catharsis.

209
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,968
Hmm. Well, I disagree.

210
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,475
Now, I will only
repeat myself once.

211
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,146
There will be
no Back to School dance.

212
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,038
<i>Huddle up, guys.</i>

213
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:25,490
All right, Munroe,
let's see if we can catch them napping.

214
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:26,908
- On one. Ready?
- Break!

215
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,197
Watch your man!

216
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:35,884
Attaboy, Reggie! Don't give 'em
an ounce of daylight, all right?

217
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,919
Come on. You hear me?

218
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:38,887
Blue, 34.

219
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:40,472
Blue, 34.

220
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,174
Down. Set. Hut!

221
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,017
Come on!

222
00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:58,941
Hey!

223
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,359
Get over here.

224
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:02,195
Now!

225
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,001
Get over here!

226
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,402
What are you doing?

227
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,538
That guy just made you
look like a damned fool.

228
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:15,507
He's fast.

229
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,925
It's unacceptable.

230
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,761
That was
an embarrassing display.

231
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:21,429
Go out there. Come on, man.

232
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:23,265
Show me somethin'.

233
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,613
What the hell?

234
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,117
Oh, you have
got to be kidding me.

235
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,654
Vixens!

236
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:49,241
This pervert was taking
pictures of us while we changed.

237
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:52,460
Collecting photos for your sad,
pubescent spank bank, are you?

238
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,547
No! No.

239
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:59,134
A reporter from Rumordale.com reached
out, and he told me

240
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:01,670
he would pay 500 bucks
for a photo of Veronica.

241
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,454
How am I supposed to
say no to that?

242
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,423
You ust say it, you worm.

243
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,596
Nice job out there, Mad Dog.

244
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,565
Thanks.

245
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,900
It's Munroe, actually.

246
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,269
Oh, my bad.
I thought it was Mad Dog.

247
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,064
Or is that just
what they called you in jail?

248
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,109
It was juvie.

249
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,864
And your boy Archie
was right there with me.

250
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,123
Look, is there a problem, guys?

251
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,280
No, bro, we're cool.

252
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:30,699
But settle a bet.

253
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,952
In prison showers, is it true what
they say about dropping the soap?

254
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,622
He's not worth it, dude.
Trust me.

255
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:45,714
What the hell is wrong with you?

256
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,716
What do you think, Andrews?

257
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,001
I've been captain of the
Bulldogs since sophomore year.

258
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,338
I don't need some ex-con who showed
up last-minute stealing my thunder.

259
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,941
Look, I saw your dad giving you
a hard time, but man up, Reg.

260
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,176
You're supposed to be captain.

261
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,033
- Hey.
- -Hey.

262
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,370
Jug, you know Mr. Chipping.

263
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:10,572
He was just telling me about
an offer that he made you.

264
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,324
Yeah. Uh...

265
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,858
My answer still hasn't changed.

266
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,037
I'm sorry, Mr. Chipping,
but I can't go to your school.

267
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:19,748
If this is about money,
I got a few bucks socked away.

268
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,583
No. It's not just about money.

269
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,034
Boy, look me
in the eye and tell me

270
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,553
you don't want to go to a school
that recognizes your talent.

271
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,223
Jug, how about this?

272
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:30,976
How about you come take a tour,
see the place for yourself,

273
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,594
and then make the decision.

274
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,814
- I know. I... I just don't want to...
- You're taking the damn tour.

275
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:38,267
Have a seat.

276
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:44,689
<i>Charles, I'm back.</i>

277
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,575
They ran out of fortune
cookies, if you can believe it.

278
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:50,446
Charles?

279
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:16,438
Wait. What?

280
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:21,276
Is this what you do
when I'm not around, Betty?

281
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,094
You read classified information?

282
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,947
When were you gonna tell me that
you had Kevin under surveillance?

283
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:27,782
I wasn't.

284
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:31,069
From the get-go, I suspected Kevin
hadn't fully cut ties with the Farm.

285
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,988
I started monitoring his phone
activity, and it turns out

286
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,481
he's been texting with
Fangs Fogarty.

287
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,296
I'm...

288
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,466
I mean, I was hoping that
Kevin was done

289
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,384
with the Farm.

290
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,720
It seemed like he was done.

291
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,755
This might be
a blessing in disguise.

292
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,924
We could use the relationship
to our advantage.

293
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,392
In his texts,

294
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,061
Kevin keeps pushing
to meet in person,

295
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,736
but Fangs has been
holding him off, saying

296
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,732
he can't risk it unless he has
something useful to offer in return.

297
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,267
So...

298
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,319
What if we
accidentally let slip...

299
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:08,073
Some fake intel about our
investigation in front of Kevin?

300
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:09,741
Exactly.

301
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,410
Something that'll lure
Fangs out of hiding.

302
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:14,696
The first step is to
develop Kevin as an asset.

303
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:16,699
Think you can do that?

304
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,251
100%.

305
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,255
Cheryl?

306
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,680
Oh, you scared me.

307
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,960
What were you doing in there?

308
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,970
I was...

309
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,521
praying.

310
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:41,222
Since when are you religious?

311
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,342
I was looking for some divine
guidance on how to handle this

312
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,111
discord with Mr. Honey,

313
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:51,282
and the spirits didn't fail to
deliver a hellaciously simple idea.

314
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,701
Instead of throwing
a Back to School Dance,

315
00:15:53,737 --> 00:15:55,987
we are hosting
a Back to School party

316
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,040
right here at Thistlehouse.

317
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:27,602
Your name may be Honey,
but I will always be the queen bee.

318
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,354
You have no power over me.

319
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:42,784
Hey, are you Forsythe?

320
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,035
Yeah.

321
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,870
Bret Weston Wallis.

322
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,173
Mr. Chipping asked me
to roll out the red carpet.

323
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,319
You can just call me Jughead.

324
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:50,425
I prefer Forsythe.

325
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:51,876
Who's your friend?

326
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,094
Betty Cooper.

327
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,212
Cute. Very...

328
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:56,181
<i>Sweet Valley High.</i>

329
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,882
Let me give you some stats.

330
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:03,722
Our faculty holds 132 master's
degrees and 28 doctoral degrees,

331
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,106
which sounds impressive,

332
00:17:05,142 --> 00:17:07,782
but the truth is, most of our
teachers are hopelessly out of touch.

333
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,728
Except for Mr. Chipping,
he's cool.

334
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,907
And I'm not just saying that
because he's coming right behind me.

335
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,264
Mr. Chipping, how's it hanging?

336
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,283
Bret, don't let me
interrupt you.

337
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:19,154
But I wanted to invite Jughead
to sit in on a salon with us.

338
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,623
If I'm not mistaken,
we're focusing on <i>Moby-Dick</i> tomorrow?

339
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:23,491
Oh, great.
That's one of my favorites.

340
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,793
See you tomorrow, Mr. Jones.

341
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:26,077
Definitely.

342
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,545
Betty, you can come, too.

343
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,414
I bet you've got a lot to say
about<i> Moby-Dick.</i>

344
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:33,284
No. No, I don't.

345
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,254
And I think I've gotten my fill
of this place already, so...

346
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,556
It is a lot to digest.

347
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,176
Speaking of which,
in the cafeteria

348
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,595
we've got vegan, keto vegan,
raw keto vegan...

349
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,768
I don't like drama,

350
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:51,569
Ms. Lodge.

351
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,405
Neither do I,

352
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,356
Mr. Honey.

353
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:59,194
And yet, there's this article
on Rumordale.com

354
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,996
published about you this
morning, promising drama.

355
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,116
I'm assuming you've read that.

356
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,950
No.

357
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,420
I've been avoiding the tabloids
these past few months.

358
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:13,825
An unnamed inside source that worked
at your nightclub is claiming that

359
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,427
you, in fact,

360
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:18,630
are responsible for the crimes that
your father allegedly committed.

361
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:29,809
Fascinating.

362
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:32,577
Your point, Mr. Honey?

363
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,279
I was just wondering
if you shouldn't

364
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,916
take a sabbatical
from Riverdale High,

365
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,051
until you can get all these
personal matters of yours

366
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:41,921
sorted.

367
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,062
Oh, man...

368
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,031
I have missed
hanging out with you, Betty.

369
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,732
I was thinking back
to freshman year.

370
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,868
You would talk about
crushing on Archie...

371
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,817
and I'd talk about whatever
weird Grind'Em hook-up I'd just had.

372
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,974
- Or not had.
- I remember.

373
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:12,050
Kev, I think the reason
I was cold earlier...

374
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,804
I mean...

375
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,259
as you know, my mom and
Polly are still at the Farm.

376
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,961
And my half-brother is
investigating them.

377
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,763
Yeah. Um...

378
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:26,731
- Charles?
- Yeah.

379
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,400
- Right? Yeah.
- Anyways, today, finally,

380
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,103
there was a break in the case.

381
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,490
Really? What?

382
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:42,146
The FBI found a witness who's
willing to testify against the Farm.

383
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:43,198
Hmm.

384
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,284
Charles says it may
finally break open the case.

385
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:48,087
- Wow.
- Yeah.

386
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:49,704
That is...

387
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:52,958
Cheers.

388
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:02,834
Kevin?

389
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,103
Fangs, hey.

390
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:09,474
Can I at least hug you?

391
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,227
I... I miss you so much.

392
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,478
I've missed you too.

393
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:17,515
But first you said you had
some information for me?

394
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:18,816
Yeah. There's, uh...

395
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:20,952
There's a witness.

396
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:23,854
The FBI found someone who's ready
to come forward against Edgar.

397
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:24,873
Who's the witness?

398
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:27,992
I... I don't... I don't know.

399
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,627
I didn't get a name.

400
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,462
But...

401
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:35,383
Information's not the only reason
why you wanted to meet me, right?

402
00:20:35,418 --> 00:20:38,553
Kevin, Edgar and the rest of the
Farm don't think you can be trusted.

403
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:43,258
Of course, I mean,
if you found out who the witness was...

404
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,726
I mean,
that might change things.

405
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:45,761
Get the name...

406
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:47,478
and then we can be together.

407
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:49,647
Uh, yeah. I'll try.

408
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:50,933
Good.

409
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:54,102
You know how to reach me.

410
00:21:04,748 --> 00:21:05,663
Betty...

411
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:07,498
You are so messed up, Kevin.

412
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:12,837
Reggie,
Mr. Honey is riding my ass

413
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:15,540
about this article
on Rumordale.com.

414
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,409
About me. About La Bonne Nuit.

415
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:20,911
An "inside source"
with "intimate knowledge"

416
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,965
of my businesses claims that I'm
the criminal kingpin, not my father.

417
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:25,583
Was it you, Reggie?

418
00:21:25,602 --> 00:21:28,219
Are you the "inside source"?

419
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:30,054
Is that why you're hiding
behind those shades?

420
00:21:32,142 --> 00:21:34,025
I didn't say a word
to the press...

421
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,943
Oh, my God. Reggie, your eye.

422
00:21:35,979 --> 00:21:37,779
But maybe you should ask
your old man.

423
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,735
<i>So? Did Reggie admit
to leaking the story?</i>

424
00:21:44,154 --> 00:21:45,154
No.

425
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:46,938
He didn't do it.

426
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:50,776
Archie...

427
00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:53,244
Reggie had a black eye.

428
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,547
And it wasn't
the first time, either.

429
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,666
From practice, you mean?

430
00:21:58,718 --> 00:21:59,718
No.

431
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,386
No. I think...

432
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:04,723
No. I know.

433
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,926
Reggie's dad hits him.

434
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:18,845
Kevin,

435
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,180
you lied to me.

436
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,935
You told me that
you wanted to be my friend,

437
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:23,767
and then you go out
into the woods

438
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:26,986
for some secret tryst
with your cult boyfriend.

439
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:28,104
I'm... I'm sorry

440
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,890
for... for everything.

441
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:33,109
I truly do
miss being your friend.

442
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:35,412
You betrayed Betty
after she gave you a chance.

443
00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:38,998
Yeah. I wasn't thinking clearly,
I just wanted to see Fangs.

444
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:40,867
No. No. You wanted to
trade information,

445
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,787
- so you can get back in the good graces of the Farm.
- No!

446
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,650
- You're still one of them.
- I'm not, I swear.

447
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:46,956
I'm not a part of anything.

448
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:48,407
And you... You, Betty,

449
00:22:48,427 --> 00:22:51,044
you ignored me all summer, okay?

450
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,629
And I understand,

451
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:53,880
but I was alone.

452
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:56,883
At least Fangs texted me back.

453
00:22:58,586 --> 00:22:59,686
He's all I have.

454
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:04,692
Can we have a word?

455
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:19,155
He's useless.
We got to cut him loose.

456
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:20,573
No, Charles. I...

457
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,743
I believe Kevin, okay?

458
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,295
I saw them in the woods.

459
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,546
I think he'll help us.

460
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:27,947
No. We're not going to get
anywhere with him.

461
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:28,966
He's traumatized.

462
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:30,617
He's lonely.

463
00:23:31,219 --> 00:23:32,785
Listen, I'm sorry, Betty.

464
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:34,404
We'll find another way
to get Alice back.

465
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:37,924
Let's go, Reggie!

466
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,058
Blue, 18.

467
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:40,927
Blue, 18.

468
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,097
Down. Set. Hut!

469
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
Get it. Get it. Get it!

470
00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:51,971
All, come on!

471
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:55,775
All right, guys, hit the shower.
Practice is over.

472
00:23:58,363 --> 00:24:00,663
Hey! Get over here.

473
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,149
What the hell are you doing?

474
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:04,751
I had it, Dad. It just slipped.

475
00:24:04,786 --> 00:24:06,452
It slipped?

476
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,338
It won't happen again,
I promise.

477
00:24:08,373 --> 00:24:10,673
If it does, so help me,

478
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:11,791
- I'll...
- What?

479
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:14,677
You're gonna hit him again?

480
00:24:14,713 --> 00:24:16,212
Give him another black eye?

481
00:24:16,264 --> 00:24:17,130
What the hell
have you been saying?

482
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,047
Nothing, Dad.

483
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:19,766
Andrews, this is none
of your business.

484
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:22,479
Reggie works his ass off on this
field while you stand here and yell.

485
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:23,970
We all have to listen to it.

486
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:24,888
So, get the hell out of here.

487
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,523
Go. Or I'll
throw you out myself.

488
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,225
Back off, Andrews. I mean it.

489
00:24:29,277 --> 00:24:31,477
Reggie, your dad has no right
to treat you like this.

490
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:34,981
- Hey.
- Hey, hey. Knock it off, you two.

491
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,366
- Hey. Hey!
- Knock it off.

492
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:37,951
- Knock it off.
- Dead to me, Andrews.

493
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:40,287
Dead!

494
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:47,545
Go.

495
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:48,746
Go!

496
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:57,303
Hey, Forsythe.

497
00:24:57,339 --> 00:24:59,222
Guys, this is that kid
from Riverdale.

498
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:01,558
Forsythe, this is Donna,
Jonathan, Joan.

499
00:25:01,593 --> 00:25:03,726
Good afternoon,
seekers of knowledge!

500
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:05,678
Why are we not sitting?

501
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,017
Now then,<i> Moby-Dick.</i>

502
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:13,719
Hmm?

503
00:25:13,738 --> 00:25:15,271
It's well done.

504
00:25:15,323 --> 00:25:16,823
Obviously.

505
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:20,526
But it highlights a problem
that I have with the syllabus.

506
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,862
Do we really need to
hear this narrative again?

507
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,898
Right. Because the only authors
we're allowed to like now

508
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:27,900
are those who
lived an unblemished life.

509
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,835
I'm fine with that.

510
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,737
Guys, guys, guys.
Let's get back on topic.

511
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:36,175
Now, what do you think
that the whale symbolizes?

512
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,078
Nothing.

513
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:43,933
Care to elaborate
on that, Mr. Jones?

514
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:51,307
Well, it's pretty well-established
that Melville hated allegory.

515
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:53,559
And he's quoted as saying
that his biggest fear was.

516
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,594
<i>Moby-Dick</i> would be
seen as a fable.

517
00:25:55,614 --> 00:25:56,614
Any rebuttals?

518
00:26:07,242 --> 00:26:09,242
Breaking out the blonde wig,
I see.

519
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:11,628
Yes, that's the only way
I can get around

520
00:26:11,663 --> 00:26:13,463
without being harassed
by the paparazzi.

521
00:26:13,832 --> 00:26:15,281
But then...

522
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,950
you'd know all about that,
wouldn't you?

523
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:20,169
Oh, are you receiving
some blowback

524
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:22,141
from lying through your teeth
to get me arrested?

525
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:23,641
How unfortunate.

526
00:26:24,392 --> 00:26:26,342
Why did you leak the story?

527
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:28,811
Was it a desperate ploy
to get me to come see you?

528
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:31,397
<i>Mija,</i> I'm not paying
for your crimes.

529
00:26:32,017 --> 00:26:33,733
I merely told the truth.

530
00:26:33,768 --> 00:26:35,985
I told the world what you are,

531
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:38,022
a Lodge,

532
00:26:38,823 --> 00:26:39,823
through and through.

533
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,242
Deal with it.

534
00:27:03,014 --> 00:27:05,631
Whoo!

535
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,834
My esteemed guests,
may I have your attention please?

536
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:12,105
Students of Riverdale,
we have a new enemy in our midst.

537
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,273
This killjoy is our new
principal, Mr. Honey.

538
00:27:16,695 --> 00:27:19,512
However, never fear.

539
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:21,364
I, as your
student body president,

540
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:24,784
will make sure that he is
beheaded by Homecoming,

541
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:27,570
or my name
isn't Cheryl Marjorie Blossom.

542
00:27:37,632 --> 00:27:39,165
- Your drinks, ladies.
- Thank you.

543
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,884
So...

544
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,836
What's this I hear
about you transferring?

545
00:27:45,056 --> 00:27:48,508
Jug is being recruited
by Stonewall Prep.

546
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:51,010
How was the salon today,
by the way?

547
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,845
Shocked to say, I actually
kind of enjoyed it.

548
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,481
And the kids had
actually read<i> Moby-Dick.</i>

549
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:56,816
Jughead,

550
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:58,884
there is no school
more nihilistic

551
00:27:58,903 --> 00:28:00,603
and/or privileged
than Stonewall.

552
00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:04,157
Besides, why would you want to
leave your lovely girlfriend here?

553
00:28:04,192 --> 00:28:06,192
Jug, we would make
anything work.

554
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:08,227
Okay?

555
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:09,746
But I would miss you.

556
00:28:09,781 --> 00:28:11,080
Trust me when I say,

557
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,566
you would be miserable.

558
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:15,345
I'm just trying to keep
an open mind, is all.

559
00:28:16,337 --> 00:28:17,337
Hmm.

560
00:28:27,048 --> 00:28:28,631
Excuse me?

561
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:29,882
What are you doing down here?

562
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:32,769
- What's up?
- This hallway is off-limits.

563
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:35,638
The locked door at the top of
the stairs should've been a hint.

564
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,940
Yeah. The line to the
bathroom was too long.

565
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:39,108
Was looking for another one.

566
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:41,527
Then get thee to the barn
with the other animals.

567
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:55,491
Kev...

568
00:28:55,543 --> 00:28:56,543
Hey.

569
00:28:57,629 --> 00:28:58,629
Hey.

570
00:29:00,748 --> 00:29:04,133
I'm sorry
that we interrogated you.

571
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:06,118
It's okay. I get it.

572
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:07,553
You're trying to save your mom.

573
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,290
Yeah.

574
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:17,263
What I'm about to tell you

575
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,434
puts everything on the line,

576
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,352
but I believe in you.

577
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,322
What are you talking about?

578
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:31,661
My mom isn't just at the Farm,

579
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:36,282
she's undercover at the Farm.

580
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,951
She's been sending us messages all
summer, but she stopped.

581
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,920
And I'm worried that
she may be in trouble.

582
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,322
Oh, my God, Betty...

583
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:46,709
And I know that you can turn
around and tell Fangs everything,

584
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:49,011
but I'm choosing to believe
that our friendship

585
00:29:49,047 --> 00:29:51,830
runs deeper
than Edgar's brainwashing.

586
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,332
It... It...

587
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:54,351
It does.

588
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:55,636
Kev...

589
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:59,555
I need you to ask Fangs
to meet with you again,

590
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:01,474
so he can tell you
where Edgar is hiding.

591
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:02,441
He won't.

592
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:04,977
He will if you have
information to give him.

593
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,029
Like the name
of the FBI witness,

594
00:30:07,065 --> 00:30:09,448
who doesn't actually exist,
by the way.

595
00:30:09,484 --> 00:30:11,234
But we can give him a fake name.

596
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:13,986
Like who?

597
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,854
Like Penelope Blossom.

598
00:30:15,874 --> 00:30:18,491
Kev, will you do this?
Will you help me?

599
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,660
Will you help my mom?

600
00:30:21,546 --> 00:30:22,962
Of course, Betty.

601
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,820
Yo.

602
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:32,405
Who invited you, new guy?

603
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,156
Dude, Reggie, lay off.

604
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:35,792
Cheryl,

605
00:30:36,444 --> 00:30:38,044
you know this guy?

606
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,880
No, but I certainly don't
object to him being here,

607
00:30:40,915 --> 00:30:42,415
which is more
than I can say for you.

608
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,749
So what you're saying is...

609
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:45,951
Mad Dog here crashed.

610
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,640
Wonderful. And now
the po-po has arrived.

611
00:30:52,343 --> 00:30:53,843
Party's over.

612
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:54,895
Everybody go home.

613
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,063
Go home. Move.

614
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:02,935
Jughead, boy, you better not be
drinking whatever's in that cup.

615
00:31:05,189 --> 00:31:06,155
Sheriff Jones.

616
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,640
Someone get this man a beer.

617
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,076
You want to see the inside of
the drunk tank tonight, Mantle?

618
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:11,311
I'll take him home, Mr. Jones.

619
00:31:13,615 --> 00:31:15,248
What are the charges,
Sheriff Jones,

620
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:16,365
if one might ask?

621
00:31:17,318 --> 00:31:19,168
Someone called the station
about the noise.

622
00:31:19,203 --> 00:31:20,670
Impossible.

623
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:23,656
All of Thistlehouse's neighbors
are either deaf or dead.

624
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,658
Who exactly made
this absurd complaint?

625
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:26,842
Someone named, uh...

626
00:31:27,462 --> 00:31:28,462
Honey.

627
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:29,846
Party's over, Cheryl.

628
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,198
Reg, I think I already know,

629
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:43,321
but how did you get
the black eye?

630
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:47,421
What do you want me to say?

631
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,041
Huh?

632
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:53,410
That my dad hits me?

633
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:56,681
That he beats the crap out of
me over the stupidest things?

634
00:31:56,716 --> 00:31:59,884
That he's been doing it for
as long as I can remember?

635
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:03,888
I'm sorry, Reg. I really am.

636
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:10,561
I was always so jealous of the
relationship you had with your dad.

637
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,563
No matter what you wanted to do,

638
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:13,814
he always stuck by you.

639
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:17,234
I have no idea
what that feels like.

640
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:23,457
And when your dad died,

641
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:27,444
all I kept thinking was,

642
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:29,463
what if it had been
my old man instead?

643
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:40,124
Listen, what can we do?

644
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:41,291
Or what can I do?

645
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,760
You've already done enough, man.

646
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:44,595
You called him out.

647
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:47,181
Now, it's on me.

648
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,103
I got to take a stand.

649
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:54,939
So, what are you thinking?

650
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:00,778
Bro, are you sure about this?

651
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,783
Sometimes I think he loves
this car more than he does me.

652
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,799
I mean, you could just...
You could talk to him.

653
00:33:09,422 --> 00:33:10,422
I've tried.

654
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:11,956
He doesn't listen.

655
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:15,709
It's time he starts to listen.

656
00:33:22,051 --> 00:33:23,684
Holy hell, Reg.

657
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:25,102
That'll bring this to a head.

658
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:28,973
It's okay, Archie.
I outweigh him by 50 pounds.

659
00:33:38,568 --> 00:33:40,234
<i>Okay, everyone.</i>

660
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:42,787
I trust you all completed
your summer reading?

661
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:49,860
Who wants to read the
first section out loud for us?

662
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:53,314
Anyone?

663
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:56,650
All righty then.

664
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
I'll start and...

665
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:00,271
you follow along.

666
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,440
"Understanding Literature,."

667
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:05,025
Chapter Six.

668
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:07,661
English Drama.

669
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:12,950
One of the great works of the
Elizabethan Age, <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

670
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:16,203
is a tragic romance,

671
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,009
"emblematic
of both Shakespeare's..."

672
00:34:22,044 --> 00:34:23,160
I can't take this.

673
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,179
"Early period..."

674
00:34:24,213 --> 00:34:25,463
Come with me, right now.

675
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:26,881
"And of western drama

676
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:30,434
in the 16th and 17th centuries."

677
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:33,721
Okay. What's going on?

678
00:34:33,773 --> 00:34:35,890
You should go to
Stonewall Prep, Jug.

679
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,008
I hate saying that,

680
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:41,028
but it's the chance of a lifetime
and you should take it. Okay?

681
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:43,397
So, you should go
before I change my mind.

682
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,782
But what about...

683
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,450
Don't worry about us,
we'll make it work.

684
00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:48,118
We've been through way worse.

685
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:49,286
Just go pack up your stuff.

686
00:34:49,322 --> 00:34:50,788
I'll handle
everything here, okay?

687
00:34:54,627 --> 00:34:55,910
Go. Run.

688
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:05,002
How'd your old man
react to his car?

689
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:07,705
Uh...

690
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:11,225
It... It did what
it was supposed to do.

691
00:35:12,645 --> 00:35:13,677
It got us talking.

692
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,513
And I said some things
he needed to hear.

693
00:35:16,098 --> 00:35:17,765
And I...

694
00:35:17,817 --> 00:35:20,184
I don't think he'll be coming
around to practices anymore.

695
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:27,275
Bros?

696
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:29,527
Bros for life.

697
00:35:57,773 --> 00:35:59,273
Okay.

698
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:02,142
Fine. You win.

699
00:36:03,446 --> 00:36:04,945
You want to know where I stand?

700
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:06,363
All right.

701
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:08,115
I will give my first, last,

702
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:12,102
and only press conference
on the subject of my parents

703
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:14,822
tonight at
La Bonne Nuit speakeasy,

704
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:16,407
after a special performance.

705
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,616
I'm no stranger to scandal.

706
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:00,167
That's what it means
to be a Lodge.

707
00:37:00,753 --> 00:37:02,336
I love my parents.

708
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:03,621
And because I love them,

709
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,456
I trusted them.

710
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:09,493
And all those nefarious things
Rumordale.com accused me of doing?

711
00:37:09,512 --> 00:37:10,512
Yes,

712
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:12,129
I did them.

713
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:13,547
I did them under duress.

714
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,350
Because my father threatened me.

715
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:18,719
And like the good,
dutiful daughter,

716
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:20,521
I did what I was told

717
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:21,972
by Hiram Lodge.

718
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:55,839
You want to know who I'm standing
with in the upcoming trials?

719
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,093
Neither of them.

720
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:03,063
From this day forward,
I stand only with and for...

721
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:04,983
myself.

722
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:32,842
Is that your
Harvard application?

723
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:34,447
It is.

724
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:37,249
But I'm thinking of making a
change before sending it in.

725
00:38:40,204 --> 00:38:41,537
The Lodge name is...

726
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:43,072
tainted.

727
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:45,458
Like Madoff. Or Corleone.

728
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,626
But my mother's
maiden name, Gomez?

729
00:38:48,913 --> 00:38:50,546
I think I could work with that.

730
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:52,715
So, I would be dating
Veronica Gomez now?

731
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,100
Mmm-hmm.

732
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:56,102
Yeah? What's she like?

733
00:38:56,137 --> 00:38:57,186
I don't know.

734
00:38:58,356 --> 00:38:59,356
We're going to find out.

735
00:39:05,196 --> 00:39:06,729
Why, what's the matter,
Ms. Bell?

736
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:08,864
Just be careful, Cheryl.

737
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,620
Golly, what a mess.

738
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:16,072
Hope you aren't allergic,
Mr. Honey.

739
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:19,041
Toodles.

740
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:23,919
What's happening?
Have you heard from Mom?

741
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:25,082
No.

742
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:26,382
Maybe I was wrong,

743
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,017
maybe we should
roll the dice with Kevin.

744
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:31,120
Um...

745
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:34,557
I already have.

746
00:39:34,592 --> 00:39:36,642
I gave him the name
of our fake witness,

747
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:37,760
Penelope Blossom.

748
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,296
Betty...

749
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:44,066
You didn't say anything
about Alice, did you?

750
00:39:48,106 --> 00:39:49,688
You revealed the name

751
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,360
of an active undercover FBI
agent to a screwed-up kid? Why?

752
00:39:54,412 --> 00:39:56,112
Because I trust Kevin. Okay?

753
00:39:56,147 --> 00:39:57,387
I wanted to be honest with him.

754
00:39:57,415 --> 00:40:00,249
- He will find out where Edgar...
- Betty, it worked.

755
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:02,702
Kev, you're back.

756
00:40:02,753 --> 00:40:03,753
- Hey.
- Yeah.

757
00:40:03,788 --> 00:40:05,287
I, uh... I connected with Fangs,

758
00:40:06,124 --> 00:40:07,456
told him about Penelope Blossom,

759
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:08,936
and he led me to where
the Farm is staying.

760
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,661
It's an abandoned motel
beyond the maple barrens.

761
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,547
Okay. Did you see my mom?
Is she okay?

762
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,265
Uh, I didn't. I'm sorry.

763
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,683
But I did see Edgar,

764
00:40:17,718 --> 00:40:19,218
and, Betty, he's armed.

765
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:23,722
There were guns, and
he's building something, and...

766
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:24,774
Edgar's digging in.

767
00:40:25,776 --> 00:40:27,059
He's getting ready for war.

768
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:28,144
Well, we have to go.

769
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,980
We have to get in there
and save our mom.

770
00:40:38,189 --> 00:40:39,288
Well, well, well.

771
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:43,542
Do I look like a jerk?

772
00:40:43,578 --> 00:40:44,910
No, you look like a gentleman.

773
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:50,749
Stonewall's not too far,
and I'll be back every weekend.

774
00:40:51,586 --> 00:40:53,052
Hey...

775
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:55,304
I'm glad you accepted
Chipping's offer.

776
00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:57,590
You're a sort of
a legacy there, you know?

777
00:40:57,642 --> 00:40:58,540
What do you mean?

778
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:00,226
Well, your grandpa,
Forsythe the First,

779
00:41:00,261 --> 00:41:03,395
actually went to Stonewall Prep for a
couple of months until he dropped out.

780
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:04,897
What happened?

781
00:41:04,932 --> 00:41:06,381
Why didn't you
tell me this sooner?

782
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,566
It's ancient history.

783
00:41:07,602 --> 00:41:09,718
But he quit at everything,
including me.

784
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:11,977
He went out for a pack of
smokes, and he never came back.

785
00:41:12,323 --> 00:41:13,555
Anyway...

786
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:15,574
I didn't mention it because

787
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,193
I wanted this to be
your decision,

788
00:41:17,228 --> 00:41:19,912
without my old man's shadow
hanging over you.

789
00:41:19,947 --> 00:41:21,747
It's a chance for you
to do something good,

790
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:23,342
for yourself,
and I'm proud of you, son.

791
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,279
It's going to be a good year.

792
00:41:26,754 --> 00:41:27,870
Really good year.

793
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:32,875
Jughead!

794
00:41:33,244 --> 00:41:34,960
Jughead!

795
00:41:35,012 --> 00:41:36,045
Jug!

796
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,179
Jug!

797
00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:38,631
Jughead!

798
00:41:44,222 --> 00:41:45,304
Jughead!
