1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,803
It's been a quiet few months
in Riverdale.

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:18,018
Spring slid into summer,
and some semblance of normal life resumed.

3
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:24,274
The terrors of the Farm weren't forgotten,
but they had started to fade.

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,988
Gryphons and Gargoyles was already
becoming the stuff of suburban legend.

5
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,743
Indeed, the big topic of conversation
around town was July 4th.

6
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,954
After some debate, it was decided

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,665
that there would be an Independence Day
parade down Main Street,

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,293
Riverdale's first in three years.

9
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,922
But there would be no fireworks display
over Sweetwater River.

10
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,300
The Blossoms used to sponsor them,

11
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,761
but without their support,
the town couldn't afford them.

12
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,724
Like I said...
things had been pretty quiet lately.

13
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,102
Enough that I'd actually gotten
some real writing done.

14
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,816
It's beautiful.

15
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,862
- It's a beautiful story, Jug.
- Really?

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,656
You think it's worth submitting
to the contest?

17
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,367
No, I think it's gonna win the contest.

18
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,535
I love you.

19
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,787
I love you, too.

20
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,083
Can we just stay in bed forever?

21
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,087
And if not forever, at least for the day?

22
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,839
I would.

23
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,053
But don't we have to finish building a
float for your big Fourth of July parade?

24
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,848
It's not my parade, it's the town's.
Pop's is only sponsoring it.

25
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,769
Well, if not the day...

26
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,688
how about another hour?

27
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,314
Hell, yeah.

28
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,024
Okay, then.

29
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,955
Good morning, Jay-Jay.

30
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,208
Let's see what the hot gossip in town
is today.

31
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,212
And then we'll do the cross... word.

32
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,046
What the hell?

33
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,841
Over my dead body!

34
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:21,466
<i>♪ All my friends are watching,
I can hear them talking ♪</i>

35
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,148
<i>♪ Tell me what's going on ♪</i>

36
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,527
Well, well, well...

37
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,362
Stop the presses.

38
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,323
The Riverdale rag finally reported
a story accurately.

39
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,493
Not only is there going to be
some hideous,

40
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,257
janky parade snaking its way through town,

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,789
you four are the architects
of this outrage.

42
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,209
- What's your problem, Cheryl?
- My problem, Veronica,

43
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:52,005
is that the Fourth of July
is a day of tragedy for Riverdale,

44
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,548
not celebration.

45
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,676
Or have you forgotten what happened
to my poor brother Jason.

46
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,387
Cheryl, Riverdale hasn't held a parade
out of respect

47
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,182
for what happened to your brother
in... like, years.

48
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,642
I think it's time.

49
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,854
I mean... you don't have to come.

50
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,857
Oh, I'll be there, insufferable Smurf.

51
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,482
Front and center.

52
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,527
With a sign of protest in one hand

53
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,947
and a horn of compressed air
to silence any revelry in the other.

54
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,746
Great.

55
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,750
Anyone hungry for breakfast?

56
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,378
So, camping this weekend, are we still on?

57
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,174
I'm open, but what are we
talking about here? Like...

58
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,675
The woods.

59
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,262
But remember, this could... possibly be
our last summer to do this

60
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,224
because next year
we'll be getting ready to go to college.

61
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,229
And if anyone is scared of bears, well,
don't be, because Archie's been attacked,

62
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,356
like, what, multiple times
and still survived?

63
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,483
Hey, I wear my scars proudly.

64
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,073
Hey, Dad.

65
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,632
Archie.

66
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,275
I... I talked to the sheriff
up in Cherry Creek.

67
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,738
Sounds like... what happened was

68
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,409
Fred was... driving home to Riverdale
when he...

69
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:51,207
He pulled over to help someone whose car
had stalled on the side of the road and...

70
00:04:55,211 --> 00:05:00,341
another vehicle... came up on them
way too fast and... And...

71
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,469
And he was struck by it.

72
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
No.

73
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,138
No.

74
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,016
I'm sorry, Mary.

75
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,018
I'm sorry, Archie.

76
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,811
Did the other car stop?

77
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,563
The one that...?

78
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,734
So, it was a hit-and-run.

79
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,506
We have to find out who did it.
We have to catch them.

80
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,698
No, Red.

81
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,159
You don't even think about that right now.

82
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,988
I'll work with the sheriff's office
up in Cherry Creek

83
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,372
and make sure all this is taken care of.
You understand?

84
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,168
So, what happens now?

85
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,422
Have you decided on a burial
or a cremation?

86
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,672
Burial.

87
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,886
There's a plot next to his father,
Artie Andrews. Arthur Andrews.

88
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,141
Since we're transporting the body
from upstate,

89
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,811
there will be an additional cost
of $9,000.

90
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,024
Whatever needs to be done.
However much it costs.

91
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,904
The driver that makes these trips for us
isn't available until July 5th

92
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,405
because of the holiday.

93
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,034
Then we'll have the internment on the 6th,
if that's all right.

94
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,290
Hey. You remember that tree house
your dad helped us build?

95
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,877
- You mean the one he built for us?
- I remember you fell out of it, Reg.

96
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:19,836
And broke my arm.

97
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,031
Your dad drove me to the hospital.

98
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,301
I remember this one time...

99
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,765
This time, we were having a picnic

100
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,102
when we were still in grade school
in Pickens Park,

101
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:39,107
and there was a father-daughter
potato-sack race.

102
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,818
My dad...

103
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:48,533
I don't know where he was, but Mr. Andrews
said that he would do it with me.

104
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,622
So, he was... He was my dad for the day.

105
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,794
When things started getting bad
with my dad and drinking,

106
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,674
my mom would call up Fred... for help.

107
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,468
And he would drive to the bar,

108
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,959
and he would pick up my dad
and he'd lay him on the couch.

109
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,812
But he'd always stay a little while.
Just to talk to me.

110
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:24,193
To see how I was doing in school
and... if I had eaten dinner.

111
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,673
He just wanted to know if I was hungry.

112
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,283
I always was.

113
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,621
Your dad was such a gentleman, Archie.

114
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,123
He was the best.

115
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,710
He built and donated all the sets
for the musicals.

116
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,256
You don't have to, but...

117
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,593
do you have any memories you wanna share?

118
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,387
I remember going to...

119
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,976
Going to Sears with him.
Just so I could ride the tractors.

120
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,359
He taught me everything.

121
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:13,159
Taught me how to play football
and baseball.

122
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,535
Pretty much every other sport.

123
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,957
We fixed up the... The jalopy together.

124
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,378
He bought me my first guitar.

125
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,050
He even soundproofed the garage just so...

126
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,847
Hey. Archie.

127
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,140
I'm good. I just...

128
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,893
I'm wiped out, you guys.
Can we call it a day?

129
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,602
Yeah.

130
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,164
Grandpa Artie?

131
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,208
Archie.

132
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,043
Everyone's waiting.

133
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,628
Where's your dad?

134
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,131
I thought...

135
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,803
- I thought he was already with you.
- No. No.

136
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,430
Come see for yourself.

137
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,248
Where's Dad?

138
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,087
Archie... you were supposed to get him.

139
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,343
Archie?

140
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,475
I have to go get my dad.

141
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,187
What? What do you mean?

142
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,022
I have to bring him home.

143
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,380
She's all yours, bro.

144
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,132
How do you even have a hearse, Reggie?

145
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,946
It's been sitting on the lot for years.
No one wants to buy it.

146
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,096
Well, I owe you, Reg. Thank you.

147
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,306
And, you guys,
I'm sorry for calling so late.

148
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,130
It's really not a problem, man.

149
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,311
I just... I don't want my dad stuck
in some weird town.

150
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,543
And I can't wait for after July 4th
for them to bring him back.

151
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,554
He'd wanna be home, I know that.

152
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,501
Hi. I'm Archie Andrews.

153
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,921
My dad, Fred Andrews, was in an accident
on the freeway yesterday.

154
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:58,050
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.
I'm sorry for your loss.

155
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,676
Thank you, ma'am.

156
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,304
I was wondering
if you found the person responsible yet.

157
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,976
We got a description
of the car that hit your dad.

158
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,520
The make and the model,
but no plate number.

159
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,189
Nothing yet, but we're not giving up.

160
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,481
Okay.

161
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,694
Hello?

162
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,071
What happened to my dad's truck?

163
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,841
It's still at the accident site,
parked on the side of the road.

164
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,452
Okay.
Would you mind showing me where that is?

165
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,584
It's a few miles south on Route 80.

166
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,295
Right about... here.

167
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,299
The keys are with the rest of your
father's belonging's at the funeral home.

168
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,674
Okay.

169
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,845
That was them, actually.
They're ready for us.

170
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,390
- Thank you, deputy.
- Of course.

171
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,308
You hang in there, okay?

172
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,311
Thank you.

173
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,192
Hi. Good morning.

174
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,986
I'm Veronica Lodge. We just spoke.

175
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,323
- This is Archie Andrews. He's...
- I'm Fred Andrews' son.

176
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:05,117
Yes. Of course. My condolences.

177
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,148
How can I help you, Mr. Andrews?

178
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,997
I wanna bring my dad home.

179
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,668
It was my understanding

180
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,630
the deceased would be transported
to Riverdale on the 5th.

181
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,757
I know. It's... It's not right. I...

182
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
I want him home.

183
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,554
And I wanna be the one
who brings him home, today.

184
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,684
I understand.
But I'm afraid that's not possible.

185
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,275
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom.

186
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,362
Archie?
Aren't you upstairs in your bedroom?

187
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,865
No, I'm in Cherry Creek.
I came up to pick up Dad.

188
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,990
What?

189
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,535
I'm sorry, I didn't think.

190
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,581
The funeral home up here
won't release Dad to me.

191
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,666
Something about me being underage.

192
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,042
Please.

193
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,046
I really don't wanna leave Dad here.

194
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,890
Put me on the phone
with whoever's in charge.

195
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,513
I see.

196
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,820
No, that won't be necessary, Mrs. Andrews.

197
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,773
Of course. I'll just need you
to sign an authorization form and...

198
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,859
Nope. I'll do it right now.

199
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,776
Thank you.

200
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,199
I'll just go
get your father's personal effects, then.

201
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,578
- There was a set of truck keys.
- They're in there.

202
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,708
I'm going to need two to three hours
to get him ready for transport.

203
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,544
You can wait here
or you can come back at noon.

204
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,169
Can I see him?

205
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,841
Archie, you don't have to.

206
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,195
What if they made a mistake, you guys?

207
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,931
- I'd like to see my father.
- Of course.

208
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,560
He's just in the next room,
if you'd like to follow me.

209
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,502
Archie.

210
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,267
I thought... Archie
changed his mind.

211
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,395
But he asked us to make sure it's him.

212
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,848
- JUG, ONE THING YOU CAN HELP ME WITH:
- Anything.

213
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,725
My dad's obituary.

214
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,688
Could you write it? For the Register?

215
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,146
Of course.

216
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,323
Is it him?

217
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,079
Yes. It is.

218
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,666
I have his belongings.

219
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,669
Are you sure?

220
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,424
Yeah, Arch.

221
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,843
It's your dad.

222
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:06,150
Mrs. Andrews, we heard the news,
and we're so, so sorry about Mr. Andrews.

223
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,692
Thank you.

224
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,403
Mrs. Andrews.

225
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,493
When my brother Jason died,
I felt supremely alone.

226
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,583
My world was only darkness and despair.

227
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,630
I don't want you or Archie to ever feel
anything even remotely like that.

228
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,094
So... with your blessing,

229
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,931
there's something I'd like to do
for your family.

230
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,142
For when Archie returns.

231
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Can we help you?

232
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,916
No, I'm just paying my respects.

233
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,525
How do you know what happened here?

234
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:33,921
Wait, are...?

235
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,756
Are you Archie?

236
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,010
How do you know my name?

237
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,346
Your father told me.

238
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:51,773
One of my tires blew,
and... I was stranded out here.

239
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,278
You're the one he was helping.

240
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,244
I mean, cars just...
You know, they kept...

241
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,707
They kept whizzing by.
Nobody would stop, but your dad did.

242
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,297
He talked about you the entire time.

243
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,509
His... His son.

244
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:20,968
How...

245
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,390
he couldn't believe a man like him was
blessed with such a thoughtful, kind boy.

246
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,435
You were with him when he...?

247
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,146
We were working on the tire.

248
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,523
And a car just...

249
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,903
It came out of nowhere.
It... Speeding, and...

250
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,075
I'm sorry, I just...

251
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,328
I froze in its path,
and your dad, he just...

252
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,664
He pushed me out of the way.

253
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,501
He saved my life.

254
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,087
And...

255
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,207
if he hadn't done what he did,

256
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,579
there's no way that I would be here
right now. I know that.

257
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,308
I am so sorry.

258
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,603
There's nothing I can do
to ever repay him, but...

259
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,581
But I would like to say a prayer for him.

260
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,698
Maybe you'd like to join me?

261
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:38,213
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

262
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:44,636
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

263
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,723
Give us this day our daily bread...

264
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,892
and forgive us for our trespasses...

265
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,356
as we forgive those...
who trespass against us.

266
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,445
Lead us not to temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

267
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:07,367
For thine is the kingdom, the power,
the glory, forever and ever.

268
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,076
Amen.

269
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,584
<i>♪ I don't know what to say ♪</i>

270
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,212
<i>♪ 'Cause you're lookin' away ♪</i>

271
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,802
Guys, my dad saved that woman's life.

272
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,181
A total stranger.

273
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,561
And he sacrificed himself for her.

274
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,274
That's an incredible thing, Archie.

275
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,860
He died a hero.

276
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,862
Why did he have to be one?

277
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,532
Why this time?
Why c... Why did he have to stop?

278
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,696
Why couldn't he have kept driving
like everyone else?

279
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,745
Because your dad helped people.

280
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,917
- That's just who he was.
- Yeah, and it got him killed.

281
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,520
I mean, he died on the side of the road.

282
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,551
Waiting for an ambulance,
without his family, without his friends.

283
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,597
I'm sorry, but that's not heroic, that's...

284
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:12,932
That's senseless.

285
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:16,561
I promise you... that is not true.

286
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,608
- Arch?
- I'm just going outside. Need some air.

287
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,842
Archie?

288
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,009
Yeah. Yes.

289
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,555
- They found him.
- What?

290
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,892
- The guy who killed my dad?
- Yeah, he turned himself in an hour ago.

291
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,602
Who is he, Mr. Jones?

292
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,898
His name's George Augustine.
He lives in Cherry Creek. No priors.

293
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,568
- Is he in jail?
- No, he...

294
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,238
- He made bail. He was released.
- What? He's out?

295
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,032
He should be rotting in a cell, Mr. Jones.

296
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,034
He will be, but this is how it works.

297
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,454
And for what it's worth, the chief told me
the guy's real broken up about it, so...

298
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,706
He killed my father.

299
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,333
Your dad's gonna get justice,
I promise you.

300
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,836
Yeah, you're right, he will get justice.
I promise you.

301
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,045
Archie. Where are you?

302
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,385
Yes, can I help you?

303
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,140
- Are you George Augustine?
- Yes. What can I...?

304
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:19,975
Fred Andrews.

305
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,562
- Wha...? Wait.
- That's the man you killed.

306
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,105
My father.

307
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,649
Fred Andrews.

308
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,402
You hit him with your car
and you kept driving.

309
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,131
You left him there to die. You coward!

310
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,198
S... Son, listen.

311
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,201
- I was just...
- No! Shut up!

312
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,497
You took away the only man
who can call me that.

313
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,332
Why did you do it?

314
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,334
Huh?

315
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:50,298
Were you on your phone? Were you drunk?
What were you doing when you murdered him?

316
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,592
Tell me.

317
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,221
- Tell me or I swear I...
- Please, stop!

318
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,889
He didn't do it.

319
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,185
- What?
- He didn't do anything wrong.

320
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,009
Jeffrey, get upstairs.

321
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,589
What's he saying? What do you mean?

322
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,192
He told the police he did it.

323
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,570
To protect me, but it wasn't him.

324
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,325
Okay, it wa... Yeah, it was me.
It was my fault.

325
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,705
I took the car when I wasn't supposed to.
I... I... I...

326
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,292
I... I don't even have my license.

327
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,588
I'm sorry.

328
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,551
I'm so sorry.

329
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,202
- Archie.
- You had us really worried.

330
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,370
You okay?

331
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,292
How'd you know where I was?

332
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,879
My dad called. He had a bad feeling.

333
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,465
What happened?

334
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,050
I...

335
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,929
I came looking for...

336
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,144
He's just this dumb kid.

337
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:30,273
- Who is?
- The kid driving the car that hit my dad.

338
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,108
He's just stupid.

339
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Terrified.

340
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,075
That's something that I would have done.

341
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,579
Taking the car out without permission.

342
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,665
Hell, I did it a dozen times,
and his dad was...

343
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,335
Was protecting him.

344
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,340
The same way mine would have.

345
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,866
I don't know what the hell I'm doing,
you guys. I can't believe I'm here.

346
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,267
I can't believe I did this.

347
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,855
I'm a terrible son.

348
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,908
You're not a terrible son.

349
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,079
I just went into a stranger's house
and almost hurt an innocent man.

350
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,667
I think... your father would understand...

351
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,545
under these circumstances.

352
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,630
All we ever did was fight, Ronnie.

353
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,383
I lied to him constantly.

354
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,971
He would be ashamed of me.
I'm ashamed of me.

355
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,348
Archie, listen to me.

356
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:53,106
Your dad loved you... more than anyone
and anything else.

357
00:28:55,358 --> 00:29:00,405
Whenever he looked at you...
there was pride in his eyes.

358
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,074
He was proud of you.

359
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,038
- I don't know what to do.
- I do.

360
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,543
Come here.

361
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,901
You're gonna finish what you started.

362
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,302
You're gonna bring your dad home.

363
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,641
Okay.
The hearse is behind the funeral home,

364
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,019
ready to go. Ronnie and I will take it.

365
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,230
- You guys take my dad's truck back?
- Of course, Arch.

366
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,065
Yeah. We'll just follow you guys.

367
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,026
Thanks.

368
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,302
- Everything all right, Mr. Jones?
- Everything's good, Red. I...

369
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,722
I heard what you and Jug and the girls
were up to

370
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,098
and I wanted to be a part of it.

371
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,615
I'd like to give your dad a police escort
the rest of the way home,

372
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,729
if you're okay with that.

373
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,355
He deserves it.

374
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,736
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

375
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,738
- Follow me then?
- Yeah.

376
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,039
- I couldn't leave him there, Mom.
- I know.

377
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,585
I brought Dad home.

378
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,128
You did.

379
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,673
You sure did.

380
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,219
I'm so proud of you.

381
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,264
I know he would be, too.

389
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:19,664
And now... Fred's son, Archie,
would like to say a few words.

390
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,310
Earlier, I was thinking...
on the drive over here...

391
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,189
how much of Riverdale my dad built.

392
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,442
Or just fixed up.

393
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,281
Houses, office buildings.
A bit of everything.

394
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,578
He helped build this town.

395
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,501
And one day, if I'm lucky enough
to have a son or a daughter of my own...

396
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,941
I'll be able to point to a building...

397
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,800
or even just a brick in a building
and say:

398
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,930
"Your grandpa made that...
with his hands."

399
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,479
It's the Fourth of July.

400
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,860
I remember this one Fourth...
it was raining.

401
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:37,742
The fireworks show was canceled.
And I was so bummed,

402
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,827
I remember sitting in the backyard
just balling...

403
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,540
until my dad came home
with all these fireworks.

404
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,293
I mean, enough to burn a house down.
You remember that, Mom?

405
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,799
And...

406
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,361
we lit them in the backyard.
It was just... It was the best night.

407
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,110
My dad was there
for every high and every low.

408
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,734
He's the greatest man I've ever known.

409
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,664
It hurts me
that I never got to say goodbye...

410
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,954
that I won't get to see him again
or talk to him...

411
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:35,633
but his spirit and his memory lives on
in this town and in everyone he's met.

412
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,763
Fred Andrews will always be a part
of Riverdale.

413
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,435
I love you so much, Dad.

414
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,403
- Excuse me. Mrs. Fisher?
- Oh.

415
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,574
- Wonderful service, didn't you think?
- Yes. It was.

416
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,156
- I'd like to discuss the payment with you.
- It's already been taken care of.

417
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,123
By Mrs. Andrews?

418
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:11,252
- I didn't want her paying for any of this.
- No, by your father.

419
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,879
He paid the bill in full.

420
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,433
How do you sum up the life
of a man like Fred Andrews?

421
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,602
You could start with the facts.

422
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,480
That he was born
at Riverdale General Hospital.

423
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,734
That his parents
were Arthur and Virginia Andrews.

424
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,237
That he led
the Riverdale High baseball team

425
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,031
to two consecutive state championships.

426
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:27,787
Took over the family business at 18,
got married, had a son, settled down.

427
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,539
And while others were rushing
to get out of Riverdale,

428
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,625
Fred was setting down roots.

429
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,837
When our town saw a pariah
and closed its doors,

430
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,549
Fred saw a lost soul and opened his.

431
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,679
There was always room at his table,
in his home, for others.

432
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,809
Whenever our town was under attack,
Fred was on the front line,

433
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,560
fighting for it, defending it.

434
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,690
He was our Good Samaritan,
our George Bailey,

435
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,400
our knight in flannel armor.

436
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,611
And by the way,
he was a hell of a good tipper.

437
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,113
Damn right, he was.

438
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,283
Fred left Riverdale better
than when he found it.

439
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,995
That's his legacy.

440
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,210
Mom.

441
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,153
We're about to start. Are you ready?

You already are, Archie.

449
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,689
No, not yet.

450
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,151
But I'm gonna honor him.

451
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,324
I'm gonna honor his memory every day.
