00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:13,722
[Jughead] <i>Well, it finally happened,</i>
<i>the moment we've all been waiting for.</i>

2
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,598
<i>A fire in the woods.</i>

3
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,227
<i>Three friends in their underwear,</i>
<i>covered in blood.</i>

4
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,108
<i>My iconic beanie up in smoke.</i>

5
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,240
<i>Driving back to Riverdale,</i>
<i>they didn't say one word to each other.</i>

6
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,953
<i>They should've. They should've gotten</i>
<i>their stories straight.</i>

7
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,464
[Hiram speaking in Spanish]

8
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,466
[Hermione] And where are your clothes?

9
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,009
Oh.

10
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,302
Um...

11
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,391
I got coaxed into an intense game
of strip poker

12
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,602
at that stupid Stonewall Prep party.

13
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,313
Lost my shirt, as they say.

14
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,523
Oh, well.

15
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,150
[speaks in French]

16
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,615
[Mary] Archie, what are you doing?

17
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,658
It's almost 3:00 in the morning.

18
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,660
Why are you in your boxers?

19
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,124
Everything's okay, Mom.
I was just at a-- A-- A Stonewall party.

20
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,669
We all went skinny-dipping and some
preppies stole our clothes as a prank.

21
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,756
-What are you doing up?
-I had insomnia.

22
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,968
Are you okay? You look...

23
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,846
Yeah. No, everything's fine.

24
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,682
I'm sorry it's so late.
I'm gonna go up to bed.

25
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,155
Elizabeth, you better have
a good explanation

26
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,491
for keeping me up till all hours
of the night.

27
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,159
Why are you in your underwear?

28
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,412
Is that blood on your bra?

29
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,457
No. Relax, it's red wine.

30
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,669
Underage drinking in the middle
of the night, half-naked--

31
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,754
No, I wasn't even drinking.

32
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:14,425
I went to a stupid Stonewall party
that turned out to be toga-themed.

33
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,138
Bret spilled a bottle of wine all over me
and I couldn't stand the smell.

34
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,181
But I don't understand,
where are your clothes?

35
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,977
I put them... in a sink to soak off.

36
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,272
-When I was leaving, I couldn't find them.
-That makes no sense.

37
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,567
So, Jughead couldn't just lend you
one of his grungy flannels?

38
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:37,365
I'm tired. I need to wash up
and go to bed, okay? I'm sorry.

39
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,449
Be-- Betty.

40
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,173
[whimpering]

41
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,477
[Jughead] <i>That's the thing about murder,</i>
<i>you've gotta have the stomach for it.</i>

42
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,730
[Betty retching]

43
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,816
<i>Especially if all signs</i>
<i>point to you having committed it.</i>

44
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,739
Toga party, strip poker
and skinny-dipping.

45
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,991
Those are three
wildly different activities.

46
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:23,703
If our parents compare notes,
we could be in deep, deep trouble.

47
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,497
I panicked, Betty. I blurted out
the first thing that came to mind.

48
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,665
-Me, too.
-Me three.

49
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,209
But this is exactly the kind
of mistake we can't afford to make.

50
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,170
Charles made that abundantly clear.

51
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,091
We should've called someone
other than Charles.

52
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,968
No, Charles was the right call to make.

53
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,304
-He's had experience dealing with--
-[Veronica] Bodies.

54
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,765
-Dead bodies.
-As a matter of fact, yeah.

55
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,517
He's an expert.
Without him, we'd all be in jail now.

56
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,645
For what? We didn't do anything, did we?

57
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,481
Did we, Betty?

58
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,070
-When Archie and I found you and Jughead--
-I had just found Jughead, too.

59
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,404
You were holding the rock.

60
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,198
Yes. I-- I picked up the rock.

61
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,493
That was a stupid mistake.
I played right into their trap.

62
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,330
Those psychotic preppies are trying
to frame us for murder.

63
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,791
-Why us? They barely know us.
-Me, then.

64
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,502
They're trying to frame me
for Jughead's murder.

65
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,214
That has to have been their plan.
They wanted me to be caught red-handed

66
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:20,510
standing over Jughead's body,
with my DNA smeared all over everything.

67
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,929
It's the only thing that makes sense.

68
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:26,933
Okay.

69
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,688
Okay, we have to be smart about this.

70
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,690
We have to take them down.

71
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,651
We cannot let them get away with this,
with what they've done.

72
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,736
Betty, why would they want
to murder Jughead?

73
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,073
Maybe Jughead got closer to the truth
about Chipping's death than they liked.

74
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,324
Or maybe...

75
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,829
-Maybe what?
-Maybe this is just a game to them.

76
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:52,417
This whole thing is a game or an
experiment to commit the perfect murder.

77
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,877
-If it's a game, then it's a sick one.
-[Kevin] Hey, guys.

78
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,546
What's up? Can I join you?

79
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,715
Kev, we're in the middle of something.
Catch you later?

80
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,592
Uh, yeah, of course.

81
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,931
Archie, that was exactly the wrong thing
to do. We have to pretend to be normal.

82
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,975
Everything is normal. Kev!

83
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,477
Come back. Archie's just kidding.

84
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,897
-Right, Arch?
-Yeah. Sorry, Kev, my bad.

85
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,107
All good.

86
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,278
What are you guys talking about?

87
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,822
-Seems intense.
-No. Nope, nothing.

88
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,616
How's the musical,
have you decided what you're doing?

89
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,368
[Kevin] Yeah.

90
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,169
Oh, good. Archie, you're home.

91
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,755
Remember my friend from Sarah Florence,
Brooke Rivers?

92
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,465
From the Naval Academy, right?

93
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,134
-Nice to see you again, Counselor Rivers.
-Hey.

94
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,430
So, Brooke was just in town for a visit,
and we were catching up.

95
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,432
And of course,
I told her about your situation.

96
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,268
What situation?

97
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,896
Oh, with school and colleges.

98
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:59,108
And she thought-- Well, we thought
that we might have an idea.

99
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,403
Archie, I was talking with your mom,
and I was telling her

100
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,739
how impressed I was with you
when we met last year.

101
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,408
Really? Even though I passed out
and fell flat on my face

102
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,910
before the exhibition match?

103
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,788
People can be taught to know their limits.

104
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,832
They can't be taught gumption
and fortitude.

105
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,584
That's what I see in you.

106
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,838
That's why I'd be willing to recommend you
to the commandant for the Naval Academy.

107
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,299
-If you're interested.
-The Naval Academy?

108
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,927
It's a long shot,
but it could be a path forward.

109
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:30,056
-Assuming you'd want it, Archie.
-Sure, Mom. Yeah, that sounds great.

110
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,266
Thank you, Counselor Rivers.

111
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,729
Would you like to join us?

112
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,191
Uh, I think I'm gonna go for a run,
actually. Thanks again.

113
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,787
[Hermosa speaks in Spanish]

114
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,123
You're just in time.

115
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,127
No offense, Hermosa,
but I am not in the mood to pretend

116
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,586
like I can stomach your antics.

117
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,131
Veronica.

118
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:07,093
Honey, why don't you take a seat?
We've got something important to discuss.

119
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:10,721
Okay.

120
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,981
<i>Mija,</i> I've decided to update my will.

121
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,275
Your will?

122
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,653
And let me guess...

123
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,114
this was Hermosa's idea?

124
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,073
Me?

125
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,243
-Why would you think that?
-Oh, I don't know.

126
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,912
Maybe because you always seem
to show up when it suits you.

127
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,207
And you're so much better?
Changing your name,

128
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,460
deliberately undermining
<i>Papi's</i> rum business.

129
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,337
As usual, you have no idea
what you're talking about,

130
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,715
so why don't you sink back
to whatever Florida swamp you--

131
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,758
[speaks in Spanish] Enough!

132
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,094
I'm the one who wanted this.

133
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,305
As a precaution.

134
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,681
Just in case.

135
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,602
It's a normal thing, people do this.

136
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,606
Normal?

137
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,322
Are we really going to play this game?

138
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,325
Are you seriously going to pretend
like this is normal?

139
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,578
-Veronica--
-Mom, I'm sorry, but I can't take this.

140
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,955
There's only so much pretending I can do.

141
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,337
You really want me to sign off
on your will, Daddy?

142
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,424
Don't you think you should've been
honest with me first?

143
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:33,012
About what everyone in this room
knows is happening,

144
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,640
even if they're too scared
to talk about it.

145
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,648
There, that's what I think
about your will.

146
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,656
[exhales]

147
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,617
[line ringing]

148
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,372
Mr. Jones? Hey, it's Betty. Um...

149
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,542
"I'm sorry to bother you,
but I haven't heard from Jug all morning,

150
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,378
and I'm starting to get a little worried.
Have you talked to him?"

151
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,923
Just at the party last night.

152
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,221
"The only thing I can think of
is that he went somewhere to write.

153
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,140
I know he had to finish a draft
of his novel."

154
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,769
No. You know what, I can go
to Stonewall Prep and see if he's there.

155
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,230
I have to pick up some stuff
I left in his room anyway.

156
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,111
Thanks, Mr. Jones. I'll do the same.
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

157
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,742
-How was that?
-Very convincing.

158
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,744
You did exactly what you would do

159
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,705
if you hadn't heard from Jughead
for a few hours.

160
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,710
-You ready to go into the lion's den?
-I think so.

161
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:46,919
Okay.

162
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,672
In that case, here's the bug.

163
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,926
And remember, besides planting it,
our goal is to--

164
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,471
Find out what they know,
what they think happened

165
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,515
and what they thought was going to happen.

166

-[knock on door]
-[Bret speaks indistinctly]

167

Oh, hey, Ponytail, what's up?

168

Hi, I haven't heard from Jughead today.
I wanted to know if you guys had seen him.

169
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:09,900
Not since the party.

170
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,194
Not since the two of you walked off
in the woods together.

171
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,571
We didn't do that.

172
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,074
You and I went into the woods together,
Donna.

173
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,534
Did we?

174
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:24,665
All I remember is you met up with Jughead
and peeled off together, hand in hand.

175
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,377
That... didn't happen.

176
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,463
-It did.
-Hmm.

177
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,258
Maybe you don't remember
because... you were pretty drunk.

178
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,595
I'm surprised you didn't black out.
Or did you black out?

179
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,142
No, I was fully conscious the entire time.

180
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:48,147
Are you sure about that?
Because your friend Evelyn Evernever

181
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,192
said you have a history of blacking out...

182
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,945
and doing terrible things.

183
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:02,203
Bret, how about you? Did you and Jug have
any interesting chats at the party?

184
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,539
Oh, no. Not really.
Forsythe was in a mood more than usual.

185
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,124
He had a bunny mask on.

186
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,671
Last thing I remember was him saying he
was gonna meet up with you in the woods,

187
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,423
-which I assume happened.
-It didn't.

188
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,093
He did say he wanted
to talk to you though.

189
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,680
So, Betty, are you saying you
and Jughead didn't meet up in the woods?

190
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,682
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.

191
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,060
I'm saying you and I went
into the woods together.

192
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,186
And then what happened?

193
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,149
Don't you remember?

194
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,070
If you're that worried,
maybe you should call the police.

195
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,906
Oh, I already told his father,
the sheriff,

196
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:39,949
so he's aware.

197
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,326
-Interesting.
-Shut up, Bret.

198
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,954
Well, I'm sure he'll turn up,

199
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,373
but let us know if you hear anything.

200
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,333
Will do.

201
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,798
Oh, and, Betty, let us know
if you remember

202
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,300
whatever happened when you blacked out.

203
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,602
-Watch where you're going.
-Yeah, back at you.

204
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:18,028
My dad made out a will, and he still
refuses to admit that he's sick.

205
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,991
My mom wants to ship me off to the Navy.

206
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,994
-What?
-And I don't even care.

207
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,789
-Ronnie, all I can think about is--
-I know. Betty.

208
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,959
Me, too.

209
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,754
That's kind of why I texted you, Archie.

210
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,257
Why was Betty holding the rock?

211
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,343
-Because she picked it up.
-Why?

212
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,055
Why would she do that?
She knows about fingerprints and DNA.

213
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,223
What do you think happened?

214
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,061
I don't know, maybe... she had an episode.

215
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,647
-Ronnie, come on.
-Archie,

216
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,151
you didn't see her sophomore year
with Chuck Clayton in the hot tub.

217
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,736
She went full Sybil.

218
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,280
She thought she was Polly
and Chuck was Jason.

219
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,282
And I swear, for a minute there...

220
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,161
I thought she was going to drown him.
It was terrifying.

221
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:11,457
And even more terrifying was that
the next day, she didn't even remember it.

222
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,750
It was like she'd blacked out.

223
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,127
That was Chuck Clayton, this is Jughead.
She would never--

224
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,129
What if she didn't know she was doing it?

225
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,548
We saw her, Archie.

226
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,383
With the rock.

227
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,761
Covered in blood.

228
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,519
Hello, Evelyn.

229
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,395
It's nice to see you again, Betty.

230
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,066
{\an8}So, tell me,
what can I do for you this time?

231
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,078
Did a girl named Donna Sweett come
and visit you?

232
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,788
{\an8}From Stonewall Prep?

233
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,289
{\an8}She did.

234
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,750
{\an8}She asked me about your time at the Farm.

235
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,882
{\an8}Donna said you told her
about some post-hypnotic suggestion

236
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,634
{\an8}that I would be susceptible to.

237
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,969
{\an8}Oh, what, like some...

238
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,806
{\an8}magic word that would cause you to fugue

239
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,891
{\an8}in such an extreme way that you could...

240
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,477
{\an8}hurt someone you love and not remember it?

241
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,397
{\an8}I mean...

242
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,483
{\an8}I guess it's possible.

243
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,489
{\an8}But what specifically
is bothering you, Betty?

244
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,908
{\an8}I can tell something is.

245
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,173
{\an8}I went to a party last night.

246
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,929
{\an8}And I think I blacked out.

247
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,311
-And I wanna know--
-What you're capable of?

248
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,687
{\an8}Right?

249
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,899
Come on, Betty, you already know.

250
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,905
{\an8}And besides,
I actually have a question for you.

251
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,325
{\an8}How's Jughead doing these days?

252
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,041
Go to hell, Evelyn.

253
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,752
{\an8}Oh, I'm already in hell, Betty.

254
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,255
{\an8}This is hell.

255
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,549
{\an8}And soon you're gonna be here, too,

256
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,093
'cause they're saving a cell for you
on murderer's row

257
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,805
down the hall from Old Sparky,
where they keep all the boyfriend killers.

258
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,658
Hey, where'd you go after Stonewall?

259
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:57,081
{\an8}-Um, just made a pit stop at Pop's.
-You okay?

260
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,043
{\an8}Yeah, I'm fine.
Have you heard anything interesting?

261
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,754
{\an8}No. Nothing.

262
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,799
{\an8}Bret's just been monologuing about
his new Rolex for the last 30 minutes.

263
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,551
{\an8}Okay, we need to do something
that rattles them,

264
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,597
{\an8}that forces them to make a mistake,
or to say something...

265
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,141
incriminating.

266
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,109
{\an8}-[Mary] Hey, how was your run?
-Oh, it was good.

267
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,572
Listen, I'm sorry
if I just sprang that on you.

268
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,907
What, the Naval Academy?

269
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:33,993
It's fine, Mom.

270
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,494
Good.

271
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,665
Um, because there's something else
that I need to talk to you about.

272
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,334
What's up?

273
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,046
Brooke's not just my friend.

274
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,466
She's... my girlfriend.

275
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,053
-Your what?
-We hadn't been close since college.

276
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,807
And then we reconnected
after her husband died in Afghanistan,

277
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,851
which was really hard on her.

278
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,812
And first I just thought
I was comforting her, and then...

279
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,107
I don't know, it just happened.

280
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,028
I don't want there to be any secrets
between us, Archie.

281
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,156
-I hope you're okay with it. Are you?
-Yeah, Mom.

282
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,325
-I'm not gonna lie, I'm surprised--
-[knocking on door]

283
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,288
Oh, hi. Hey, Mrs. Andrews. Um...

284
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,373
Archie, do you have a second?

285
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,833
Yeah, totally.

286
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,169
-We'll talk more later, Mom, cool?
-Yeah.

287
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,545
Nice to see you.

288
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,177
<i>I need your help with something.</i>

289
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,512
Of course. Anything, Betty.

290
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,223
I need you to go to Stonewall
and start a fight with Bret.

291
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,561
What? I thought we were supposed
to be laying low, acting normal.

292
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:46,398
We are. Going to Stonewall Prep is exactly
what Archie Andrews would do

293
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,358
in retaliation
for what they did to Jughead.

294
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,610
What will it even accomplish?

295
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,946
Besides revenge for Jughead,
it would get them talking.

296
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,449
We know it was them, we just need proof.

297
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,950
Do we know it was them?

298
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,911
I mean, we didn't see them.

299
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,914
Of course it was them.
Who else would it have been?

300
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,545
Bret!

301
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,090
Oh, crap.

302
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,348
-What did you do to Jughead?
-Nothing, you plebe. Now get away--

303
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,061
The hell you didn't. Admit it!

304
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,856
You killed Jughead.
You killed my best friend.

305
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,028
Archie, you're done! I called
campus security. They're on their way.

306
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,115
I suggest you go,
or the police will be next.

307
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,745
Don't kid yourself, Elmo.
You and I both know who killed Jughead.

308
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,958
It was Betty.
Don't let her drag you down with her.

309
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,303
[Donna] <i>What the hell was</i>
<i>that about, Bret?</i>

310
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,931
[Bret] <i>That red-headed lout accosted me</i>
<i>out of nowhere.</i>

311
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,142
<i>Wanted me to confess to offing Forsythe.</i>

312
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:08,480
<i>The irony being, of course,</i>
<i>that we know who Forsythe's murderer is...</i>

313
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,732
<i>Ponytail herself.</i>

314
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,488
Betty, Betty, Betty.
How stupid do you think we are?

315
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,241
[Donna] <i>Planting bugs like a rank amateur.</i>

316
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,119
<i>Sending a bull into a china shop.</i>

317
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:26,999
You're gonna seriously have to up your
game if this is gonna be any fun for us.

318
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,127
<i>-Bye for now.</i>
-[static crackles]

319
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,965
-[groans] They are so infuriating.
-It's okay. They're smart.

320
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,634
We just have to be smarter.

321
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:44,850
[Mary] Archie.

322
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,102
Archie.

323
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,856
I just got off the phone
with the headmaster at Stonewall Prep.

324
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,692
He said that there was an incident
at the dorm.

325
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,903
Apparently, you attacked a student?

326
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,654
It was that douchebag, Bret.

327
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,241
-He had it coming to him.
-Archie, what is going on with you?

328
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,993
Are you upset with me?

329
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,078
-About Brooke?
-What? No.

330
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,457
-No, Mom. Of course not.
-Can you tell me what's wrong?

331
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,294
-It's incredibly complicated.
-I know I'm not your father,

332
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,172
but you can tell me
what is happening in your life.

333
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,049
You just need to trust me.

334
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,635
Let me in and I will help you.

335
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,933
-Mom--
-[buzzing]

336
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,190
-Hello?
-[Betty] <i>Stop talking, Archie.</i>

337
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,275
<i>Don't say another word.</i>

338
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,736
<i>Tell your mom that everything's fine,</i>

339
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,321
but that you have to go.

340
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,365
Say it's about Veronica.

341
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,160
<i>Just end the conversation</i>
<i>before you say something stupid.</i>

342
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,120
Do it now.

343
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,710
I understand, Veronica.
I'll be right over.

344
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,172
-That was Veronica. Look, I have to--
-You have to go.

345
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,049
You always have to go.

346
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,593
-You're avoiding me, Archie.
-I'm sorry, Mom, it's just...

347
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,139
Ronnie asked me not to say anything,
but her dad is sick.

348
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,434
-Like really, really sick.
-Oh, my God. With what?

349
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,687
It's some muscular thing.
I'm not sure exactly.

350
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,940
Ronnie's really upset
so I haven't asked her too many questions.

351
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,401
But that's no excuse to disrespect you.

352
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,070
I'm so sorry.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

353
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,535
[Alice] Elizabeth.

354
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,037
Can you come here for a moment?

355
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,497
What's going on?

356
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,338
I got to admit, it was Jellybean's idea.

357
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,007
We've been calling Jug's phone.

358
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,384
Of course, no answer.
It's been going straight to voicemail.

359
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,052
But then Jellybean said that...

360
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,305
we should try to track it.

361
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,017
That there's a way to, uh...
To ping a lost phone.

362
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,351
So, we did that.

363
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:55,188
And sure enough, it started to... To ping.

364
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,025
Where was it?

365
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,447
In your jacket.

366
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,576
So, I guess I'm wondering, Betty...

367
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,705
what the hell are you doing
with my missing son's phone?

368
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,257
Well, Elizabeth, explain yourself.

369
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,925
Okay.

370
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:24,843
Uh...

371
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,345
The night of the party,

372
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,016
Jughead was talking
about losing his phone.

373
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,351
He thought he had lost it in the woods,

374
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,938
but I reminded him
that he had just left it here to charge.

375
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,816
Before the party it was dead,
so we plugged it in to charge it.

376
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,112
And when we left for the party,
we must've forgot about it.

377
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,448
"Forgot about it"? All this time?

378
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,700
-Okay, how did it get into your jacket?
-Yeah.

379
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,994
I must have picked it up at some point.

380
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,245
"At some point"?

381
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,499
Elizabeth, Jughead is missing,

382
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,126
you have his phone.
You didn't think it was worth mentioning?

383
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,337
Well, I don't know what to tell you, Mom.

384
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,297
I'm worried, okay?

385
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,008
This is the longest Jughead and I
have ever gone without talking,

386
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,135
even when we've been in a fight.

387
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:11,181
So, please forgive me
if I'm not 100 percent lucid about this.

388
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,814
I think we should declare Jughead
a missing person, Mr. Jones.

389
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,440
Can you do that?

390
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,028
I'm losing my mind here.

391
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,950
[Veronica] So, that's
where Jughead's phone was?

392
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,411
The preppies must have snuck it
into my pocket when I was at Stonewall.

393
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,288
-To make you look guilty.
-Exactly.

394
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,208
You know what?
Joan bumped into me as I was leaving.

395
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,211
That's probably when it happened.

396
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,380
God! This-- This was a move.

397
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,465
Okay? Just like everything else
that they do.

398
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,386
They are treating this like a game
of chicken, and they're enjoying it,

399
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,389
but I am not about to blink, are you?

400
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,270
[door closes]

401
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,272
Veronica.

402
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,527
Daddy.

403
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,365
Where are Mom and Hermosa?

404
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,075
I sent them to the club.

405
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,335
<i>Mija,</i> I'm sorry.

406
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,967
You deserved to hear the truth from me.

407
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,264
Why didn't you tell me?

408
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,813
I didn't want the pity.

409
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,944
I didn't want you to see me as weak.

410
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,446
Ever.

411
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,072
Daddy...

412
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,787
all I want is to be a source
of strength for you.

413
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,084
I love you.

414
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:10,550
And... we're going to fight
our way through this.

415
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,220
Together.

416
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,848
What can I do?

417
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,141
Well...

418
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,400
it would give me peace of mind...

419
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,614
if you'd just try to get along
with Hermosa.

420
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,450
I mean, she's your family.

421
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,202
Sisters.

422
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,789
Okay, Daddy.

423
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:44,918
I'll try.

424
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,223
[ringing]

425
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,397
Mr. Jones, is everything okay?

426
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,315
[FP] <i>I don't know yet, Betty,</i>
<i>but I got a lead.</i>

427
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,483
I, uh...

428
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,655
I just got a call from a hiker
who found a bloody rock in the woods

429
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,116
at the same place
where the Stonewall party was.

430
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,120
Oh, my God, do you think...?

431
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,788
<i>That it's Jughead's blood?</i>

432
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,458
We won't know till we get it tested.

433
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,755
Can I do anything to help?

434
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,965
<i>Not at the moment, no.</i>

435
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,676
I have to go pick up the rock
and bring it back to the station.

436
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,346
Okay. Will you let me know
what you find out?

437
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,264
<i>I will.</i>

438
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,109
Jellybean.

439
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,904
Do you have any of that fake blood
left over from Halloween?

440
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:56,906
Yeah, I think so.

441
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,075
Can you find that for me?

442
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,670
<i>Charles, we have a problem.</i>

443
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,548
FP got a call about a bloody rock

444
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,592
that they found in the woods
behind Stonewall Prep.

445
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,635
But you threw the bloody rock
in the swimming hole.

446
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,679
[sighs] <i>Exactly. But think about it,</i>

447
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,307
the preppies must have known
that I would get rid of the rock

448
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,310
so they must've had a backup one
with Jughead's blood all over it,

449
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,228
<i>and I'm sure my prints are on it, too.</i>

450
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,106
If they planted a murder weapon
covered in the victim's blood

451
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,524
and FP gets ahold of it...

452
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,568
there's not much we can do.

453
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,614
On the contrary.

454
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,163
Betty called me and gave me a heads-up.

455
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,168
-That's the rock they found?
-Yeah, it is.

456
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,255
I'm gonna send it out to the lab,
have it tested, see if it's a match.

457
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,384
Listen, the local lab will take a week
or more.

458
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,887
But if I send that to Quantico,
we know in two days, tops.

459
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:15,151
-So, I send this decoy to Quantico?
-Put it down. Yes.

460
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,613
They will test it and discover
that it's fake blood.

461
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:23,201
Just some prop
in a stupid prep-school prank.

462
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,121
-This will buy us a couple days, tops.
-Every second counts.

463
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,375
What's their next move, do you think?

464
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,838
But that's not possible.

465
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,174
And can I ask what prompted this review?

466
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,638
I see.

467
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,265
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,

468
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,727
but not as sorry as you'll be
to hear from my lawyer.

469
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,272
That did not sound good.

470
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,275
Barnard College is reconsidering
my admission.

471
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,403
Apparently, they received an anonymous tip

472
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,823
that I'm running an illegal
liquor operation, the Maple Club,

473
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,908
and now my application is under review.

474
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,703
I'll give you one guess
as to where that call came from.

475
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,204
-The Stonies.
-Who else?

476
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,914
It's like we're in a war.

477
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,084
Yeah, Betty's war.
I'll follow her to the ends of the earth,

478
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,296
but we need to know the truth
about what happened at the party.

479
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,255
All of it.

480
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,050
-Before this gets any worse.
-[Betty] <i>What do you wanna know?</i>

481
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,093
Everything.

482
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,512
What do you mean? I told you everything.

483
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,889
That you can remember.

484
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:31,436
But, Betty, when Archie and I found you
standing over Jughead's body,

485
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,979
you were holding the rock.

486
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,565
There's no reason you would've done that.

487
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,067
You wouldn't have picked up that rock,
not consciously.

488
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,699
You're right.

489
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,580
I would've-- I should've been trying
to keep Jughead's brains

490
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,123
from falling out of his head.

491
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,502
I think...

492
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,337
maybe I...

493
00:29:58,922 --> 00:29:59,756
blacked out.

494
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,634
-Why didn't you tell us?
-Because I'm scared.

495
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:07,055
I'm terrified that I might've done it,
that I might've...

496
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,183
Whatever happened, Betty, we're with you.

497
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,894
But somehow,
we have to figure out what happened

498
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,980
after your conversation with Donna

499
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,775
and before you woke up
next to Jughead's body.

500
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,568
Do you remember anything?

501
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,986
I don't.

502
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,404
But I...

503
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:30,161
I think Donna might've said a trigger word
that caused me to hurt Jughead.

504
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,372
A trigger word?

505
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,416

506
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,878
-Yeah.
-Didn't Charles help you with that?

507
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,424
Maybe... he can help again.

-And we can all find out--
-What I did to Jughead.

509

[Charles] All right, Betty,
we're looking for missing time.

510

Right before you woke up next to Jughead.

511
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,778
Start by just letting yourself relax.

512

a deep state of relaxation.

516
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:27,427
I need you to try and recall the events
leading up to the moment of your blackout.

517
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,138
Try to remember the details
of your environment,

518
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,725
your movements,
your interactions that night.

519
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,979
Find yourself back in that place.

520
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,231
Inhale.

521
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,567
Exhale.

Donna...

527
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,679
Donna and I were in the woods,

528
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,558
and she blew this powder,
like this white powder, at me.

529
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,562
I must've... breathed it in,

530
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,106

Did she say anything?

532
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,819

533

just messing with me.

it might be scopolamine.

What the hell is that?

538
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,709
It's commonly known as Devil's Breath.

539
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,170
It's a potent drug
that blocks certain neurotransmitters,

540
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,965
affecting one's short-term memory,
much like a blackout.

541
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,009
When inhaled,
it leaves a victim disoriented

542

but completely unaware.

543

Delivering a killing blow to Jughead?

546
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,731
Doubtful.

547
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:08,277
Much more likely,
she put that rock in your hand herself

548
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,570

Fascinating theory.

to the authorities

568
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,091

No need to answer me.

Donna may not be showing it,
but she's scared.

678
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,486
They all are.

679
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,528
Finally.

680
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,114
So, what do we do now?

681
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,158
We wait, Arch.

682
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,660
For what?

683
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,957
For them to make the next move.

684
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,209
<i>♪ Rule the world ♪</i>

685
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,128
<i>♪ You and I ♪</i>

686
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:50,841
<i>♪ You and I will rule</i>
<i>This twisted, broken world ♪</i>
