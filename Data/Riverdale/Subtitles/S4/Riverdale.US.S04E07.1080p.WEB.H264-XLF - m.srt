1
00:00:00,913 --> 00:00:02,428
<i>Previously, on</i>
"Riverdale"...

2
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:05,065
I'm excited to fulfill
a lifelong dream of mine

3
00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:07,273
and announce my candidacy
for mayor.

4
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:09,375
Our father needed help.

5
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:10,936
"Our father"?

6
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:12,572
Thank you for meeting
with me, Mr. DuPont.

7
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:14,163
I wanted to talk to you about
the first book

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,539
in the Baxter Brothers series.

9
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:16,609
You didn't write it.

10
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:18,039
You're very lucky

11
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,255
I don't take you
to the Headmaster

12
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:21,593
<i>and get you expelled.</i>

13
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:22,627
Are you okay?

14
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:24,063
I'm sorry, Jughead,

15
00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:26,062
that I couldn't help you.

16
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:29,492
I will be taking over
Mr. Chipping's seminar.

17
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:32,185
Aunt Cricket?
Uncle Bedford?

18
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:33,429
- Cheryl.
- Uncle Bedford?

19
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:37,404
You are going away
for a long, long time, Cheryl.

20
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:39,320
Let go of her,
you monster.

21
00:00:42,428 --> 00:00:43,591
You want to fight me again?

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,953
Don't you need to put
your mask on first?

23
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:48,185
We got to get him
to a hospital.

24
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:52,446
<i>Thanksgiving.</i>

25
00:00:52,945 --> 00:00:55,015
<i>The time of year
when friends and family</i>

26
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:56,470
<i>gather to eat turkey,</i>

27
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,194
<i>watch the big game,</i>

28
00:00:58,282 --> 00:01:00,340
<i>and give thanks
for all that they have.</i>

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,157
<i>But for Archie, this year was
all about what he'd lost.</i>

30
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,798
<i>It was the first Thanksgiving
without his father.</i>

31
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:12,616
<i>The void that
Fred Andrews left</i>

32
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,522
<i>was as cold as the winds
blowing through the town.</i>

33
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:19,921
<i>And while Archie was thinking
of ways to give back,</i>

34
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,884
<i>Riverdale's new mayor was
grabbing all that he could.</i>

35
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:25,851
<i>Hiram Lodge had
run unopposed,</i>

36
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:29,387
<i>allowing him to ascend
to power virtually overnight.</i>

37
00:01:29,808 --> 00:01:33,267
<i>Meanwhile, across town,
at Riverdale General Hospital,</i>

38
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:35,473
<i>a different family gathering
was taking place.</i>

39
00:01:35,738 --> 00:01:37,660
<i>For the Dickenson crime clan,
the only</i>

40
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:39,915
<i>dish on the Thanksgiving menu
was revenge.</i>

41
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:42,497
Now that our boy Dodger
is stable,

42
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:45,433
we'll find whoever did
this to him.

43
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:48,199
Guy from the community center.
Got to be.

44
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:50,912
What community center?

45
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:53,082
Who the hell are you
talking about?

46
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,127
<i>Weather forecasters were
calling for an epic ice storm,</i>

47
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:58,455
<i>and you could literally feel
the temperature dropping.</i>

48
00:01:58,543 --> 00:01:59,614
<i>Mija.</i>

49
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:02,955
Hey, you were missed
this morning.

50
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:07,098
Oh, wait,
was your inauguration today?

51
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,444
Well, you can make it up to me
tomorrow night.

52
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:13,282
I made reservations at
the Sweetwater Country Club.

53
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:15,751
I'm helping Archie at
the community center.

54
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:18,353
Yeah,
Archie's community center...

55
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:20,283
Wasn't a man found

56
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:21,908
bleeding out,
on theverge of death,

57
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:23,220
right in front of it?

58
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,447
Just terrible what's going on
in that part of town.

59
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,396
It's a real problem.

60
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:32,434
Well...

61
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:33,787
You make sure you wish

62
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,623
Archie a very
happy Thanksgiving for me.

63
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:42,049
All right, everyone,
bring it in. Come on!

64
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:44,330
Hustle up, hustle up.

65
00:02:47,603 --> 00:02:48,924
All right, look.

66
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:50,621
We know some of you guys

67
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,291
have nowhere to go
for Thanksgiving.

68
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:53,462
So, Munroe and I,

69
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,193
we're gonna keep the
center open tomorrow.

70
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:58,291
We're gonna have hot meals
with all the fixings.

71
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,531
- Seriously? You guys are cooking?
- Hell, yeah.

72
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:03,931
- And my mom.
- And grandma.

73
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,189
So tell your friends there's an
open-door policy.

74
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:07,539
Everyone is invited.

75
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:09,236
All right.

76
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,843
And with that,
the seminar is adjourned

77
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:14,071
for the
remainder of the week.

78
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,646
I hope you all have
a restful and productive

79
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:19,259
Thanksgiving break.

80
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:23,088
Mr. DuPont, before you go,
I was wondering...

81
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,557
I was wondering
if you had any more information

82
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:28,361
about why Mr. Chipping
killed himself.

83
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:30,804
Alcoholism.

84
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:32,265
Drove him to the edge.

85
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:34,796
Rupert had many demons,
I'm afraid.

86
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:36,319
Well, he didn't leave a note.

87
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:37,614
There hasn't been much of
an investigation.

88
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:40,197
The family's request.
And it was clearly a suicide.

89
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:42,140
You saw it
with your own eyes.

90
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:46,654
Mr. Chipping didn't come to you
to talk about me, did he?

91
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:48,122
No. Why would he have?

92
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:51,656
- Well, because I shared with...
- That ridiculous notion...

93
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:53,781
Of your grandfather

94
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:56,764
writing the original
Baxter Brothers novel?

95
00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:58,593
He never bought it up.

96
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:01,382
And might I make a suggestion,
Mr. Jones?

97
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:05,312
That you forget about this delusion
over the Thanksgiving break.

98
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:09,094
Now if you will excuse me.

99
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,468
Are you still gonna make it?

100
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:17,123
Even with this biblical ice
storm that they're predicting?

101
00:04:17,211 --> 00:04:19,771
Jug, I don't care what my mom
or the weatherman are saying.

102
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,724
There's zero chance that I'm
not seeing you this weekend.

103
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,857
<i>Well, then hurry up
and get here already.</i>

104
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:26,260
I need your help
with something.

105
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:29,365
Oh! You mean writing your
Baxter Brothers sample?

106
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:32,086
<i>Well, I am on a deadline and that's
the reason I'm hunkering down,</i>

107
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:35,904
but... also, considering you and I are
going to be the only ones on campus,

108
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:38,028
I figured it would be
the perfect time

109
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:41,664
to do a little sleuthing into
Chipping's death.

110
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:44,263
Because believe me,
no one else is doing it.

111
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,479
Hmm.

112
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:48,929
Conspiracy theories and
a murder mystery to solve.

113
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:51,398
Sounds like a
romantic getaway to me.

114
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:54,414
All right. I love you,
see you later.

115
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:02,031
Did you hear
the good news, T.T.?

116
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:06,421
There's a category-four ice storm heading
towards Riverdale like the wrath of God.

117
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:08,671
How is that good news, Cheryl?

118
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:13,648
Well, whilst the rest of Riverdale
sits down to give thanks,

119
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:16,377
we'll be dumping Bedford's body
in Sweetwater River.

120
00:05:16,554 --> 00:05:18,234
Just before it freezes over.

121
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:20,063
By the time spring
thaw comes around,

122
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:21,929
the salmon will have
gobbled up his eyes.

123
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,903
Toni.

124
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:29,711
What is it, my sweet?

125
00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:33,164
I feel like somebody is
watching me all the time.

126
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:35,984
Whatever guilt
you're experiencing,

127
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:38,359
free yourself of it.

128
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:42,835
You didn't set out
to do anyone any harm.

129
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:44,256
Remember?

130
00:05:44,453 --> 00:05:47,203
You were defending me
and I love you for it.

131
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:53,218
Feast your eyes on this, boys.

132
00:05:53,306 --> 00:05:55,322
A true Thanksgiving cornucopia.

133
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:56,593
Wow!

134
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,453
Ronnie, how...

135
00:05:58,652 --> 00:05:59,671
Where did you get all of this?

136
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:01,953
I put in a to-go order
at the country club.

137
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:03,867
Daddy gave me the idea.

138
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:05,539
I figured this could
supplement whatever

139
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:07,304
you and yours are
cooking for the kids.

140
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,015
Red,

141
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:11,288
tell me
this doesn't mean

142
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:13,482
you're deep-frying
a Thanksgiving turkey?

143
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,086
Yes. I am. It's tradition.
My dad would do one every year.

144
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,421
Best damn turkey
I ever tasted.

145
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:21,841
You should come by tomorrow,
Mr. Jones.

146
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:24,724
Actually, Archie,
that's what we need to talk about.

147
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:28,066
I hate to do this,
but I'm under orders...

148
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:30,148
to shut you down.

149
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,711
What?
Orders from who?

150
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,554
Let me guess,
the Mayor?

151
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:37,654
Well, you have got
to be kidding me.

152
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:39,026
- He can't do this.
- Yeah, he can,

153
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:41,265
he's mayor now.
He can do anything.

154
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:44,787
And technically, the attack on
Dodger is an open investigation.

155
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,123
So this is still an active
crime scene, plus,

156
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:48,469
Hiram said,
with the ice storm coming...

157
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:50,404
He's doing this
to punish me.

158
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:52,107
To get me
to spend the holiday with him.

159
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:53,959
- Can't we push back?
- I did.

160
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:56,232
For a couple of hours.

161
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,326
Look.

162
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,890
I'm not supposed to say this,

163
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:05,601
but I know what I would do,
if I was in your place.

164
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:08,234
Screw him!

165
00:07:08,756 --> 00:07:09,984
Yeah.

166
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,890
I'm sorry, but Hiram Lodge
is not canceling Thanksgiving.

167
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:15,280
Good man.

168
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:17,851
You're doin' your dad
proud.

Hey!

173
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:39,780
Wow, that was fast.

174
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:42,177
I took an earlier train
to beat the storm.

175
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:45,991
Jug.

176
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,421
Hit "save."

177
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:49,189
I know. I'm sorry.

178
00:07:49,374 --> 00:07:50,894
I am almost done
with my first chapter.

179
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:52,760
Yeah,
and I can't wait to read it,

180
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,965
and to help you sleuth.

181
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,784
But right now,
we have some catching up to do.

182
00:07:57,872 --> 00:07:59,189
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

183
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:06,333
FP? What's wrong?

184
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:08,489
Hiram.

185
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:10,627
Can't believe
I'm working for him again,

186
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:12,762
still doing
his damn dirty work.

187
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:14,379
Well...

188
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:17,432
You could do like
we talked about. You could quit.

189
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,262
That's what he
expects me to do.

190
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:20,832
But you know
what I am not gonna do?

191
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,559
I am not gonna wear
that crap uniform

192
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:23,819
to tell
a bunch of teenagers,

193
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:25,724
that they can't feed homeless kids.
It's...

194
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:30,553
Well, whatever you decide,
I back you 100%.

195
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:33,975
I appreciate that, Alice.

196
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:36,506
But, I do have one request.

197
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:42,068
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

198
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:45,873
Not really in the mood to cook.

199
00:08:46,388 --> 00:08:48,896
So, can we have turkey dinner
at Pop's tomorrow night?

200
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:51,154
Fine by me.

201
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:54,865
Since we have the house
to ourselves...

202
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:04,123
What happened to
dinner at the club?

203
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:06,551
Oh, well, the club was closed
because of the storm,

204
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,826
so, we decided to order in.

205
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:11,006
Plus, I have to take
an earlier flight back to Miami.

206
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:12,168
But,

207
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:16,014
I couldn't bear to miss
my first Thanksgiving

208
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:18,834
all together,<i> hermanita.</i>

209
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:21,850
Please, join us.

210
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:23,841
Never.

211
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:26,506
Only your blackened heart

212
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:28,176
would take away
Thanksgiving

213
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:30,537
from a bunch
of underprivileged kids,

214
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:32,490
just to get
what you want.

215
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:35,777
Are you referring to my decision
to close Archie's shelter?

216
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:37,701
It was a matter
of public safety,<i> mija.</i>

217
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,217
It's nothing personal.

218
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:49,436
Neither was that...

219
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:51,271
<i>Papi.</i>

220
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:55,666
<i>You sure
you still wanna come, Mom?</i>

221
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:57,268
<i>Yeah, it's Thanksgiving.</i>

222
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,949
And I know the difference
between the letter of the law

223
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:03,160
and doing what's right.
And feeding those kids is what's right.

224
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:07,183
Anyway, Hiram is not gonna
have guards stationed outside the door.

225
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:08,982
Honestly, I'm more worried
about the storm.

226
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,355
Well, I'll put chains
on the truck's tires

227
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:13,345
and salt the sidewalk,
around the center.

228
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:17,394
Mom?

229
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:19,812
Hey, what's wrong?

230
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,532
Your father.

231
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:24,942
I just miss him.

232
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,820
- It's not right.
- No.

233
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,043
But, hey,

234
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:31,750
we'll get through this.

235
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:34,718
And we're doing
exactly what he'd be doing.

236
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,322
<i>We're in trouble,
Cheryl.</i>

237
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,998
- Pray tell?
- I just ran into your Aunt Cricket.

238
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:47,472
She's parked down the road,
spying on us.

239
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:49,483
That's the reason
why I've been feeling watched.

240
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,883
Did you interact with
that nosy old turkey wattle?

241
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:54,795
Babe, how are we gonna get rid
of your Uncle Bedford's body

242
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:56,711
now that she's staking us out?

243
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:01,998
We need to scare dear Cricket off,
once and for all,

244
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,714
and disabuse her of the idea

245
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:06,748
that she will ever get
even a sliver

246
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:08,474
of our maple empire.

247
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:13,138
By...

248
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,326
inviting her

249
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:19,865
to celebrate a traditional
Blossom Thanksgiving with us,

250
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:22,044
one honoring my Gothic,

251
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,667
ghoulish roots.

252
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:25,295
I am afraid to ask.

253
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:27,966
Toni,

254
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,415
there is a family legend
Nana Rose shared with me

255
00:11:30,502 --> 00:11:33,521
on one of her
more lucid days...

256
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:35,353
that will be the centerpiece

257
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,716
of a carefully-planned
performance art piece.

258
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,456
A tale so gruesome,

259
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,227
it will turn
Aunt Cricket's hair white

260
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:44,165
and send her fleeing
into the night,

261
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:46,086
never to be heard from again.

262
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:51,269
I missed you.

263
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,865
Hmm, I missed you too.

264
00:11:56,505 --> 00:11:59,076
I was thinking about
Mr. Chipping again earlier.

265
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:04,107
How he died just after he went to
talk to DuPont, about my grandpa.

266
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:07,373
I think Mr. DuPont

267
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:10,529
threatened or blackmailed him
into killing himself.

268
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:13,982
Wow, that's an...

269
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:16,081
extreme theory, Jug.

270
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,716
What's the motive?

271
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:21,755
Well, the Baxter Brothers franchise
is worth something like $200 million.

272
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:23,995
That's a compelling motive
for Mr. DuPont

273
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,294
not to want his fraud exposed.

274
00:12:25,382 --> 00:12:28,183
Yeah, but what leverage
did DuPont have over Chipping

275
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:29,949
to make him kill himself?

276
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:32,068
This is where
it gets interesting.

277
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:35,146
How do you get someone to do
something they don't want to do?

278
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,833
Blackmail, right?

279
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,599
Look...

280
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,820
at these yearbook photos
I printed out

281
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:44,055
of Mr. DuPont and Chipping.

282
00:12:44,142 --> 00:12:45,990
These are decades apart.

283
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:47,722
You notice anything?

284
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:51,100
Is that the same tiepin?

285
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,412
Yes.

286
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:54,365
Apparently,

287
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,238
that is the mark
of Quill and Skull.

288
00:12:57,326 --> 00:13:00,638
It's one of Stonewall's
oldest secret societies.

289
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:02,870
And like
so many secret societies,

290
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,941
what if their initiation
has something to do

291
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:07,355
with you revealing your deepest
and darkest secrets?

292
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:10,800
Well, then DuPont may have used
Chipping's blackmail material

293
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:12,425
to coerce him into suicide.

294
00:13:12,513 --> 00:13:14,201
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

295
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:17,355
Then, maybe some of my current
classmates are part of the same society.

296
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:18,990
I mean, I checked Bret's side
of the room,

297
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:22,498
but so far, there is no sign
of a telltale tiepin.

298
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,029
Is it getting colder in here?

299
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:27,224
Yeah.

300
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,348
The radiator is on.

301
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:31,802
Just barely.

302
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,591
This is the part where
we freeze and starve to death?

303
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:39,357
No, this is the part where we get
back in bed and order Chinese food.

304
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:52,341
Of all the burger joints,
they have to walk into ours.

305
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:53,435
Mr. Lodge!

306
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:55,090
Wasn't expecting
to see you here tonight.

307
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:57,761
Well, truthfully,
our dinner plans fell through,

308
00:13:57,849 --> 00:13:59,386
so, we braved the storm.

309
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:00,873
Take a seat.
I'll be right out.

310
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:02,327
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Pop.

311
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,568
Oh, thank you.

312
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:09,654
FP. Alice.

313
00:14:09,793 --> 00:14:14,544
<i>♪ Should old acquaintance
be forgot... ♪</i>

314
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:15,787
Hermione,

315
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:17,333
Hiram...

316
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,466
Would you like to join us?

317
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:24,536
We would love to.

318
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:26,177
Yeah, okay.

319
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,966
That's strike three.

320
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:32,740
Nowhere is going to be delivering,
because of this ice storm.

321
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,130
How about...

322
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:38,583
I just raid
the vending machine?

323
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:39,976
Yes.

324
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:42,425
I can finally live out
my Charlie Brown fantasy

325
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:44,342
of having junk food
for Thanksgiving dinner.

326
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:46,177
Yes! Okay, I will have

327
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:48,427
Stonewall's finest
chocolate chip cookies,

328
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:50,800
chips, soda
and candy, please.

329
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,646
Get yourself something too.

330
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,748
Who the hell are you?

331
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:23,065
What do you want?

332
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:26,685
Betty...

333
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:29,021
I saw him sneak
past the door.

334
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:32,763
What the hell, you guys?

335
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,827
What did you do to him?

336
00:15:35,914 --> 00:15:37,675
Donna, what did we do?

337
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:39,330
What're you guys
doing here?

338
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:42,162
And why're you wearing...
bunny masks?

339
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,669
And carrying an ax?

340
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:45,996
We were just trying to scare you, Jones,
have a little fun.

341
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,805
All right, well,
now your friend is bleeding

342
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:50,187
and I'm sure this place's infirmary
is locked up really tight,

343
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:53,071
so yeah, that's fun.
Let's get him up.

344
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,642
<i>Oh, there he is.
What's going on, Eddie?</i>

345
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:56,580
<i>You want some cider,
some coco?</i>

346
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:59,077
Even if this storm's
keeping most people away,

347
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:01,419
thank goodness
you're doing this, Archie.

348
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,753
Where else
would they have gone?

349
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,399
I don't know.

350
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:07,196
But I'm thinking, maybe we should
keep the center open overnight.

351
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:08,926
No one should be out
in this ice.

352
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:11,480
You're too good
for this world, Archiekins.

353
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:13,617
Hey...

354
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:15,685
How are you holding up?

355
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:18,254
I'm good, why?

356
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:19,717
I just...

357
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:21,657
wanna make sure you're okay.

358
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,026
And I am, Ronnie.

359
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:29,031
It hasn't totally hit me yet,
I don't think.

360
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:31,317
Well,

361
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,852
when it does...

362
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:35,399
I'm here for you.

363
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:37,884
Okay?

364
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:41,548
Hi. Okay.

365
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:46,954
<i>Just make yourselves at home
and have some cider.</i>

366
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:53,024
Hey, guys, come on in.
Welcome to the center.

367
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:54,378
And who are you?

368
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:56,626
I'm Archie.
I run the center with Munroe,

369
00:16:56,714 --> 00:16:58,124
my friend.
We're glad to have you.

370
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:00,711
But, you're just
a kid yourself.

371
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:03,413
Hey, Archie, uh,
there's a spill over here.

372
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,563
I don't know where
the bucket and mop is.

373
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,132
Uh, I got it, Mom.

374
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,568
Excuse me, guys, uh,

375
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:10,412
help yourself to some
hot chocolate or cider.

376
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:12,095
Dinner will be ready in a bit.

377
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:28,340
That should do it.
Three stitches, not too bad.

378
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:31,592
Yeah.
It's easy for you to say.

379
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,506
Well, maybe next time,

380
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:36,764
don't threaten my boyfriend
with an ax.

381
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:51,653
"It saddens me greatly
to realize

382
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:54,608
that these will be
the last words I ever write."

383
00:17:55,302 --> 00:17:56,396
Hands off, Forsythe.

384
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:57,520
What was that?

385
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,852
Was that a suicide note?
Mr. Chipping's?

386
00:18:00,143 --> 00:18:01,658
It was an exercise we did.

387
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,176
We each wrote
a note to see

388
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:05,679
who could best capture
the inner workings

389
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:07,314
of Chipping's troubled mind.

390
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:08,615
If it was
an official exercise,

391
00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:10,381
then why wasn't I included?

392
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,779
It was outside
the curriculum, relax.

393
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:16,174
Come on, Bret,
let's get you cleaned up.

394
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:24,798
Jug, what are they
doing here, really?

395
00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:26,400
I don't know.
But I certainly don't believe

396
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:28,856
any of that BS
about a writing exercise.

397
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:31,538
Well, maybe it's incriminating
evidence that

398
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,694
they wanna get rid of,

399
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:35,108
or fake evidence
that they're trying to plant.

400
00:18:35,662 --> 00:18:37,496
Okay. How are we
gonna play this game?

401
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:39,246
You said it.

402
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:42,000
Your chums like playing games.

403
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:45,946
Let's give them
a taste of their own medicine.

404
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:52,559
Aunt Cricket, we're so thrilled
you were able to join us...

405
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,254
and that you brought
Cousin Fester.

406
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,895
Well, I wanted witnesses,

407
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:58,532
so I don't go missing
the way Bedford did.

408
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:00,084
Don't be silly.

409
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:01,968
Dinner will be ready soon.

410
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,920
Can I offer you some
mulled berry wine to start?

411
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,448
Hey, Archie.

412
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:19,186
What's up, Eddie?

413
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,436
You see those people
over there?

414
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:25,006
I've seen them before
at the arcade.

415
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,295
They're Dodger's family.

416
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:32,866
What the hell? You sure?

417
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:37,160
All right.
Thanks for the heads-up.

418
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:38,811
Go grab a seat.
I'll take care of it.

419
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,116
And hey, be cool.

420
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,741
I'm not sure
what you're here for,

421
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:53,701
but you and your boys
need to leave.

422
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,139
We've got kids here.
We don't want any trouble.

423
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,110
We don't want
any trouble either.

424
00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:03,770
But we've come for the man

425
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:05,576
who tried to kill
our Dodger.

426
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:08,967
Got a feeling he's you,

427
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,304
or one of your friends.

428
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,561
I swear to you,

429
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:15,032
no one here tried
to hurt Dodger.

430
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,389
Well, someone did.

431
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,914
And whoever it is,

432
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:20,287
he's got a real soft spot
for this place.

433
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:23,468
We think, if we hang out here
long enough,

434
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:25,562
he'll show.

435
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:27,616
In the meantime,

436
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:31,743
how about some of that
delicious food I'm smelling?

437
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:33,765
You guys remember,
back in high school,

438
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:35,787
when we all used to
hang out together?

439
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:38,465
Us griping about
how horrible our parents were.

440
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:40,561
And now we're
the horrible parents.

441
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:45,572
Fred never complained
about his folks, not once.

442
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,412
Look what an amazing father
he turned out to be.

443
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,217
Think we could all take
a lesson from that, huh?

444
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:57,951
Hey, what say we continue this
downstairs, over drinks?

445
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:00,787
- Huh? To toast Fred!
- Yes.

446
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:02,889
What do you say, FP, huh?

447
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:04,676
You're not on duty, are you?

448
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:09,155
Why the hell not, Mr. Mayor?

449
00:21:11,284 --> 00:21:15,670
Well, considering we're trapped
here until the morning, at least,

450
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:18,672
what say we pass the time with
a game of "Never Have I Ever"?

451
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,803
I do love a good salacious
drinking game.

452
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:23,811
I'll start.

453
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,811
Never have I ever...

454
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:28,417
kissed a girl.

455
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:31,881
Betty.

456
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,967
Never have I ever...

457
00:21:38,635 --> 00:21:39,936
done drugs.

458
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,065
Jones, I'm surprised.
Isn't Riverdale, like,

459
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:47,264
the drug capital of the world?

460
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:50,638
Never have I ever...

461
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,030
been in a gang.

462
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:56,787
Really?

463
00:21:57,368 --> 00:21:59,149
But you look so sweet.

464
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:02,241
Oh.
Well, I'm not as sweet as you might think.

465
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:10,561
Never have I ever been
in a secret society.

466
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:17,778
Oops. Looks like you lose
that round, Forsythe.

467
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:19,670
Now you gotta finish
the whole flask.

468
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:28,420
Time for a refill. I'll go get
the bottle from your room, Jug.

469
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:15,876
Jug, I found this tiepin
in Donna's room,

470
00:23:15,964 --> 00:23:17,850
and it has an engraving
on the back.

471
00:23:18,192 --> 00:23:20,272
The initials "RC."

472
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:22,462
What was Mr. Chipping's
first name?

473
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:23,697
Rooper!

474
00:23:23,784 --> 00:23:24,827
- These are his initials.
- Mmm-hmm.

475
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:26,829
How does Donna have this?

476
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,703
Killers often take something
from their victim

477
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,108
as a souvenir or trophy.

478
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:40,298
How long can this go on for?

479
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:42,639
We have to fight back.

480
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:45,643
No offense to your "guns,"
Munroe, but they have real ones.

481
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:48,251
If I can get into the office,
in my desk,

482
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:51,246
I have a drawer full of weapons
that I confiscated off of the kids.

483
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:53,303
- Knives, switchblades...
- No. Hold on.

484
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:55,613
I'm not sure
I endorse this plan.

485
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:58,647
Adding more weapons to the stew?
One of those kids could get hurt.

486
00:24:09,104 --> 00:24:10,876
- Matthew!
- Hey, you little runt.

487
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:12,139
- You want this?
- Relax. Relax.

488
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:14,121
- Don't do... Don't do anything!
- He didn't know what he was doing.

489
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,888
Look, he's just a kid.
Everyone, stay back.

490
00:24:16,617 --> 00:24:18,265
Archie!

491
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,826
That's for my brother.

492
00:24:22,638 --> 00:24:24,686
You know what I think,
carrot top?

493
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:28,139
I think you've got
a hero complex.

494
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:30,983
You know what else I think?

495
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:34,901
I think you beat
my boy Dodger into a coma,

496
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:38,280
and then, you called an ambulance
so no one would suspect you.

497
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:40,688
But a mother, she knows.

498
00:24:41,585 --> 00:24:43,033
And you...

499
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:45,889
You are gonna pay
for what you've done!

500
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:48,690
Now, get your ass down.

501
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,023
Say it.

502
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:04,162
Say it's you.

503
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,216
You're the one
who almost killed my son.

504
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,423
Ms. Dickinson, please.

505
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:10,944
Whatever it is that you think
you have to do here, you don't.

506
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:12,330
Say it!

507
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:14,872
Confess, boy,

508
00:25:15,163 --> 00:25:18,013
before things start
getting real ugly in here.

509
00:25:23,174 --> 00:25:25,022
If I say it,

510
00:25:25,328 --> 00:25:27,076
you'll let everyone
else here go...

511
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,754
and you can do whatever
you want to me.

512
00:25:28,873 --> 00:25:30,396
I'll take that deal.

513
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,171
But I need to hear you say it.

514
00:25:34,838 --> 00:25:36,137
Fine.

515
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,595
Stop, stop. It's me.

516
00:25:40,947 --> 00:25:43,237
I wear the mask. I'm the Dark Duke.
Leave Archie alone.

517
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:44,998
Shut the hell up.
It's not him.

518
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,404
- It's me. The mask is mine.
- Toby, sit down and shut up.

519
00:25:48,492 --> 00:25:49,907
I'm the guy you want.

520
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:51,334
That's enough!

521
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:55,396
Now, that was
a touching display.

522
00:25:55,602 --> 00:25:56,716
Hell...

523
00:25:56,842 --> 00:25:59,076
another day,
I might have even cried.

524
00:25:59,606 --> 00:26:00,787
But not today.

525
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:03,841
I already spilled
all my tears over my son.

526
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,488
And boy...

527
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:09,808
your mother is gonna find out
exactly what that feels like.

528
00:26:13,147 --> 00:26:14,561
Go, get in the office.

529
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:16,281
Go, go, go, go!

530
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:27,998
Don't even try it.

531
00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:31,404
Stop! Step away from my son.

532
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:34,474
I have the right to protect
myself against intruders,

533
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:35,739
with deadly force.

534
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,516
So, unless you want me
to use it,

535
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:39,486
you have exactly five seconds

536
00:26:39,573 --> 00:26:41,072
to get the hell out of here.

537
00:26:41,705 --> 00:26:42,804
One.

538
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,432
Two.

539
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:46,724
Three.

540
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:49,619
Four.

541
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:57,537
Lock the door behind them
and let's call the police.

542
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:59,031
Mrs. Andrews...

543
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,537
I'm obsessed.

544
00:27:02,318 --> 00:27:04,716
Yeah. Mom, since when are
you Dirty Harry?

545
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:07,771
What was that explosion?

546
00:27:18,431 --> 00:27:22,685
Who in their right mind tries
to deep-fry a turkey inside?

547
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:31,638
You're nursing it, FP.

548
00:27:31,992 --> 00:27:34,193
What's the matter,
you don't like my rum?

549
00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:36,880
Well, someone's got
to be clear-headed

550
00:27:36,968 --> 00:27:38,982
enough to drive the
rest of you home.

551
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,055
FP...

552
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:46,186
you know, I sense
that you were upset with me

553
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:49,802
when I asked you to shut down
Archie's community center earlier.

554
00:27:52,116 --> 00:27:55,263
Anyway, I appreciate
your cooperation.

555
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,730
I'm gonna make this clear,
Hiram.

556
00:27:58,818 --> 00:27:59,738
FP.

557
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:01,482
I'm not your puppet.

558
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,488
When I took this job,
I pledged to serve and protect Riverdale,

559
00:28:04,576 --> 00:28:06,130
not to do your bidding.

560
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:14,410
Why don't you settle down?

561
00:28:14,498 --> 00:28:15,715
Mmm-hmm.

562
00:28:15,802 --> 00:28:17,302
What's the matter?

563
00:28:17,537 --> 00:28:19,863
You put a hit out on my son,
you bastard.

564
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:21,321
You think I forgot about that?

565
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,157
Yeah.
Is that why you tried to murder me,

566
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,927
at the behest of my own wife?

567
00:28:27,045 --> 00:28:28,294
Hiram.

568
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:34,637
FP.

569
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:37,968
Finish it.

570
00:28:38,987 --> 00:28:40,201
Do it.

571
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,004
- Or get the hell off me.
- FP.

572
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,676
- Come on.
- I'm not gonna do it.

573
00:28:45,782 --> 00:28:47,530
But you deserve it.

574
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:50,951
Everyone in this room...
Hell, everyone in this town

575
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:52,671
knows that you deserve it!

576
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:04,598
Whilst we all tuck into our
delicious homemade meat pies,

577
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,723
might I suggest we reminisce
about some Thanksgivings of yore?

578
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:09,768
Nana?

579
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,691
Will you regale us?

580
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:13,114
Well...

581
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:18,912
There is the story of the first
Blossom Thanksgiving, but...

582
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:21,457
it's a dark chapter.

583
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:22,897
Deeply dark.

584
00:29:22,985 --> 00:29:24,166
That's fine.

585
00:29:24,254 --> 00:29:26,236
I'd love to hear more
about your family,

586
00:29:26,352 --> 00:29:27,933
warts and all.

587
00:29:28,106 --> 00:29:30,355
The weather had turned...

588
00:29:30,544 --> 00:29:34,590
and the Blossom settlers were
surprised by...

589
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:37,396
a sudden, brutal

590
00:29:37,585 --> 00:29:39,473
onset of ice.

591
00:29:40,652 --> 00:29:42,621
Much like tonight.

592
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,395
The wagons were snowed
in, and soon after,

593
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,084
the hunger set in.

594
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:52,572
Deep.

595
00:29:53,882 --> 00:29:56,043
Aching.

596
00:29:56,574 --> 00:29:58,707
Gnawing.

597
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,887
Stomachs, groaning so loud,

598
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:04,723
they drowned
out the wind, until...

599
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:06,512
Until what, Nana?

600
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:11,660
The Blossoms turned
on one another.

601
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:14,762
They had to eat their own.

602
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,981
Survive...

603
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:20,567
on Blossom flesh.

604
00:30:23,163 --> 00:30:26,262
Do you mean... cannibalism?

605
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:31,379
I can only imagine what a scandal
like that would do to our family name.

606
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:34,118
Especially, if it were to come
out right as Aunt Cricket were

607
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:37,028
attempting to negotiate a sale
for our maple business.

608
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:40,645
Please, no one would
believe that snuff.

609
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:42,447
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

610
00:30:42,682 --> 00:30:46,153
We Blossoms have always
been highly carnivorous.

611
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:48,123
I mean...

612
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:50,840
I ate my brother Julian
in the womb.

613
00:30:51,754 --> 00:30:55,215
And you're eating those meat pies
we prepared especially for you.

614
00:30:57,069 --> 00:30:58,457
My tooth.

615
00:31:00,535 --> 00:31:02,027
What on earth?

616
00:31:04,852 --> 00:31:06,270
What?

617
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,090
Is this Uncle Bedford's ring?

618
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:11,358
What does this mean?

619
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:13,760
It means, Aunt Cricket...

620
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:16,184
that you're welcome
to search the house.

621
00:31:16,412 --> 00:31:18,551
It means that Uncle Bedford...

622
00:31:19,098 --> 00:31:20,479
will never be found.

623
00:31:20,598 --> 00:31:24,012
It means that any evidence
he was ever here...

624
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,934
is in the process of being...

625
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:28,891
digested.

626
00:31:30,902 --> 00:31:32,317
In other words,

627
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:34,265
I think you know what it means.

628
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,458
You... You're bluffing.

629
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:39,559
Not even you are
deranged enough

630
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,653
to commit such an
unspeakable abomination.

631
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:44,047
On the contrary.

632
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:46,910
Which reminds me...

633
00:31:46,998 --> 00:31:49,887
it's time for dessert.
T.T.

634
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:53,895
Face facts, Aunt Cricket.

635
00:31:53,983 --> 00:31:55,208
You and Cousin Fester have just

636
00:31:55,295 --> 00:31:57,536
committed a vile
act of cannibalism,

637
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,939
which is illegal
in this state.

638
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:02,041
So, unless you want the world
to learn as much,

639
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,596
you will leave us
the hell alone.

640
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:07,338
You do not knock on my door,
you do not harass my girlfriend.

641
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:11,231
You do not ask me to sell off
my Blossom legacy ever again.

642
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:12,733
Are we clear?

643
00:32:13,413 --> 00:32:14,575
Now,

644
00:32:14,675 --> 00:32:17,508
would you like me to pack up the rest
of Bedford for you in Tupperware?

645
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:21,269
Fester...

646
00:32:31,968 --> 00:32:34,428
There you two are.
We thought you'd been murdered.

647
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,734
No dice on the booze,
I see.

648
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,521
Not a drop to be found.

649
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,886
But I say we keep playing
the game...

650
00:32:40,974 --> 00:32:42,223
and I'll go next.

651
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,722
Never have I ever tried
to cover up a murder.

652
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:50,998
Oh, you guys are just so cool.

653
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,967
You know that?

654
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:54,769
You never break into sweat,

655
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:56,806
never betraying an emotion.

656
00:32:56,893 --> 00:33:00,342
Hell, writing fake suicide
notes, how cool is that?

657
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:04,513
Well, you guys aren't
as devious as you think.

658
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:07,886
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
left incriminating evidence,

659
00:33:07,974 --> 00:33:10,896
like Mr. Chipping's tiepin.

660
00:33:11,086 --> 00:33:12,700
You went into my room?

661
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:15,675
It was an accident.
I mean, all the doors look the same.

662
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:17,443
Between the suicide note
and the tiepin,

663
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:20,614
you two are trying to cover up
something about Mr. Chipping's suicide.

664
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,154
Or was it a murder?

665
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:23,943
Care to explain?

666
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:26,120
You were there, Jones.

667
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,931
You saw him jump.

668
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:29,872
No one pushed him
out that window.

669
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:31,482
Not physically.

670
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:35,240
But psychologically, Mr. Chipping
could have been pushed to the edge.

671
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:44,678
Donna.

672
00:33:45,464 --> 00:33:46,945
How... Where...

673
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:49,501
did you get this?
We just wanna know the truth.

674
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,508
Mr. Chipping
gave it to me, okay?

675
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,279
We were having an affair.

676
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,396
I knew
it was wrong.

677
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:04,607
And I... I didn't want
anybody to get into trouble.

678
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:07,185
So, I tried to
break it off with him.

679
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:10,778
But then he got... aggressive.

680
00:34:10,943 --> 00:34:14,457
I was so scared.
I told him, if he didn't stop,

681
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:16,998
I would go to the headmaster.
And then...

682
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,849
And the next day,
he jumped out of a window.

683
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:26,982
I can't live my life doing
Hiram's bidding, Alice.

684
00:34:27,403 --> 00:34:31,099
I'm not cut out for it.
There's too much blood on the tracks.

685
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,396
- I hear you.
- I am a Serpent, Alice. I am a Serpent!

686
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:39,467
Every bone in my body
is a Serpent.

687
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:44,467
Okay, so is there a rule that
says that you can't be both?

688
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:52,732
That's not bad.

689
00:34:53,951 --> 00:34:56,136
If Hiram can be mayor
and a kingpin,

690
00:34:56,224 --> 00:35:00,467
who says, that I can't be
sheriff and a gang leader?

691
00:35:09,496 --> 00:35:11,229
How're you feeling, my love?

692
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:16,683
I think, relieved?

693
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:20,332
Am I crazy, or did we just
manage to pull our plan off?

694
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,175
The latter.

695
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:25,681
By morning, Sweetwater
River will have frozen over,

696
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:27,962
and Aunt Cricket
and Cousin Fester will be back

697
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,628
in whatever ring of hell
they typically inhabit,

698
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:34,480
digesting those
yummy lamb meat pies.

699
00:35:35,324 --> 00:35:38,668
And Uncle Bedford's name will
never be spoken aloud again.

700
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,910
I do feel some kind of peace,

701
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,293
in some weird way.

702
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,210
We defended our home
from hostile invaders.

703
00:35:48,582 --> 00:35:50,845
And, for the rest
of the weekend,

704
00:35:50,933 --> 00:35:53,261
we have nothing to worry about
but ourselves.

705
00:35:57,464 --> 00:35:58,945
And...

706
00:35:59,275 --> 00:36:01,363
Something I haven't yet said.

707
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:08,267
I love you.

708
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,613
And I'm so grateful to you.

709
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:12,920
Yeah, love you too, babe.

710
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,757
And, happy Thanksgiving.

711
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:29,040
I'm just so confused.

712
00:36:29,316 --> 00:36:32,722
This whole time, Mr. Chipping
was the bad guy? It wasn't Bret,

713
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:34,208
or Mr. DuPont?

714
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:36,730
And poor Donna.

715
00:36:37,813 --> 00:36:41,316
I'm not so sure that Donna
isn't playing us, Jug.

716
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:43,049
What do you mean?

717
00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:44,825
Are you saying
she made all of that up?

718
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:47,096
Well, I don't wanna say that,
because there's a possibility

719
00:36:47,183 --> 00:36:49,269
that they had
a harrowing affair.

720
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,722
But there's a possibility...

721
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:55,544
in which the story
that she told me

722
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,550
was just to stall us
from uncovering the real truth.

723
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:05,293
You should just talk
to your headmaster, Jug.

724
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:07,426
I mean, get it on his radar
that something

725
00:37:07,514 --> 00:37:08,908
weird is happening
at this school.

726
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:11,089
Yeah.
That's a good idea.

727
00:37:11,445 --> 00:37:13,074
I will.

728
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:17,658
Hey, I was thinking, maybe, if the
storm clears up by tomorrow morning,

729
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:19,034
that we can go home
for the weekend.

730
00:37:19,121 --> 00:37:21,253
Sure, but in the meantime,
how...

731
00:37:21,457 --> 00:37:23,441
How will we stay warm tonight?

732
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,152
Before we start...

733
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:39,824
We were never
a particularly religious house.

734
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,777
But the one thing
we always did,

735
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:46,142
the one thing
my husband always liked to do,

736
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,832
when we sat down together
to eat as a family,

737
00:37:49,306 --> 00:37:50,933
was to say grace.

738
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:53,871
He believed in that.

739
00:37:54,623 --> 00:37:57,124
Archie, would you do
the honors?

740
00:37:57,683 --> 00:37:59,016
Yeah.

741
00:38:02,503 --> 00:38:06,793
Bless us, O Lord, for these,
the gifts which we're about to receive.

742
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,617
For this day, for this food,

743
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:13,699
for our family, for our friends,
we thank you, Amen.

744
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,203
Amen.

745
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,871
And then he would say...

746
00:38:17,805 --> 00:38:19,253
Dig in, everyone.

747
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:21,941
We're grateful to be alive,
and to be here with you.

748
00:38:32,387 --> 00:38:33,656
What's this about, Sheriff?

749
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,293
Dodger Dickenson's family
is at large and dangerous,

750
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:39,264
and we have reason to believe they might
try to get to him, before they skip town.

751
00:38:39,336 --> 00:38:42,386
Well, we monitor our patients
fairly closely.

752
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,429
Well, not closely enough,
huh, Doc?

753
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:53,260
Ah, excuse me, Headmaster?

754
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:07,251
What's that all about?

755
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,761
Donna came clean
to the Headmaster

756
00:39:09,855 --> 00:39:11,531
about her affair with Chipping.

757
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,679
How he basically
abused and harassed her.

758
00:39:16,026 --> 00:39:17,720
She was trying to
protect this family,

759
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:20,259
prevent any further pain,
but after...

760
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:22,313
Betty broke into her room,

761
00:39:22,478 --> 00:39:24,327
Donna felt like
she had no choice

762
00:39:24,415 --> 00:39:26,717
but to talk
to the authorities about...

763
00:39:26,892 --> 00:39:29,196
all the awful things
Chipping did to her.

764
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:34,097
Now I guess there's no
doubt about it anymore.

765
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,048
Chipping's death was a suicide,

766
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:40,017
driven by a guilty man's
fear of exposure.

767
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,603
Case closed, Detective Jones.

768
00:40:24,979 --> 00:40:26,306
Archie...

769
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:31,615
yesterday was without a doubt

770
00:40:31,821 --> 00:40:34,384
the strangest Thanksgiving
I've ever had.

771
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:37,821
I mean,
I pointed a gun at a woman.

772
00:40:37,908 --> 00:40:40,376
Welcome to Riverdale, Mom.

773
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:43,663
But yeah, it's a far cry
from me, you and Dad

774
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:46,025
just eating fried turkey
and watching football.

775
00:40:46,784 --> 00:40:48,392
He never made it past
the third quarter.

776
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,650
He fell asleep on the couch.

777
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:55,131
You know,
I've been thinking about...

778
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,009
that deep fryer exploding
when it did.

779
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:00,493
I mean,
what are the odds of that?

780
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:02,587
That saved us, Archie.

781
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:04,022
Yeah, we got lucky, Mom.

782
00:41:04,134 --> 00:41:06,282
No.
That wasn't luck.

783
00:41:06,804 --> 00:41:09,037
That was your dad
watching out for us.

784
00:41:11,024 --> 00:41:12,446
I think you're right.

785
00:41:13,298 --> 00:41:15,150
And that gives me an idea.

786
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:31,338
What you think, Mom?

787
00:41:31,597 --> 00:41:34,064
Your father never would
have believed this.

788
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:37,396
Everything you've been building here...

789
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,150
All of you...

790
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,549
He'd be honored

791
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:43,973
and so proud.
