[Jughead] <i>"Lynchian."</i>

{\an8}<i>Adjective to describe something inspired</i>

<i>by the noted American filmmaker,</i>
<i>David Lynch.</i>

<i>And/or to describe something that is both</i>
<i>incredibly macabre and incredibly mundane.</i>

5
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:32,240
<i>Also, Riverdale's status quo,</i>
<i>reaching new depths of perversion</i>

6
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,994
<i>with the discovery of a videotape</i>
<i>in which someone wearing a mask of me</i>

7
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,414
<i>is bludgeoned to death by someone</i>
<i>wearing a mask of my girlfriend.</i>

8
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,082
Hey. What are you guys watching?

9
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,959
Jellybean, you gotta get out of here.

10
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,961
Sorry, this is NC-17 stuff.

11
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,380
Fine. Whatever.

12
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,257
[Betty] Okay.

13
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,093
So, that was dropped off
at the sheriff's station

14
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,387
in a bin with all
of the other voyeur tapes?

15
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,892
Yeah, but the other tapes were just static
shots of people's houses at a distance.

16
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,727
This is clearly an escalation.

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,396
A recreation of whatever someone
thinks happened to me in the woods.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,025
The big questions are, who is doing this
and what are we gonna do about it?

19
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,109
Me? Nothing.

20
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,362
No, I'm not getting pulled
into some creepy new mystery.

21
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,699
But you can feel free
to get sucked into this one, okay?

22
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,494
Could always use an extra set
of eyes and ears, little brother.

[Hiram whistling]

24
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,546
You're unusually chipper today, Daddy.

25
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,133
<i>Mija, </i>I just closed
a major distribution deal.

26
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,720
As of this morning,
I'll be supplying all the rum

27
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:40,183
for the Grande family's chain of casinos,
up and down the Eastern seaboard.

28
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,685
You're doing business
with Elio's shady ass again?

29
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,187
All I'm doing is selling rum, <i>mija.</i>

30
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,565
And beating you to a market
you hadn't even considered.

31
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,567
I did consider it, weeks ago.

32
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:54,239
Instead, Red Raven is expanding
into a heretofore untapped market,

33
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,406
the college crowd.

34
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,201
With an affordable version
of our product, Maple Claw.

35
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,161
Good luck with that.

36
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,549
-What's up?
-[Fangs] What's up, Reggie?

37
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,511
What's up is I hear
you two have some scam going

38
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,721
where you're bringing in
some serious bank.

39
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,683
-Are you dealing again, Fangs?
-No. Are you?

40
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,143
No. That's why I'm broke.

41
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,478
And I want in. On whatever you're doing.

42
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,189
So... what's the scam?

43
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,780
We make tickle videos
for a guy named Terry.

44
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,781
Hmm?

45
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,325
And before you assume the worst,
it's not sexual.

46
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,245
No clothes come off at any time.
It's like an endurance sport.

47
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,082
-And this Terry guy pays you?
-[Fangs] Yeah.

48
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,002
And a lot more than dealing.

49
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,920
That's weird as hell, boys.

50
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:56,009
But... do you think
Terry could use a guy like me?

-Just looking at one of my old diaries.

-Mom, seriously?
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Oh, honey, you're so grown up.

64
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,678
I can't believe you're gonna be
leaving for Yale in a few months.

65
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,389
My precious little girl.

66
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,517
Mom, please do not cry.
If you cry, I'm going to cry.

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,685
Oh, I'm sorry.

68
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,316
What could you possibly cry about, honey?

69
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,865
You have your whole life ahead of you.

70
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,329
Three cases, as ordered.

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,583
-Your party will be the hit of frat row.
-Be a bigger hit if you two came.

You ladies supply anything
other than booze?

73
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,589
Ew. Get out of my sight!

74
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,009
Bye!

75
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,308
Honestly, Veronica,
what happened to "quality always"?

76
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,273
Oh, great,
the cast of <i>Swamp Thing </i>just got here.

77
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,150
[Veronica] Welcome.

78
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,069
I don't have any more orders
scheduled for pickup,

79
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,237
but can I help you?

80
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,658
Actually, little lady, we're just, uh,
checking out the competition.

81
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,578
Jinx Malloy of the Malloy family.

82
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,164
Maybe you gals have heard of us?

83
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,125
I'm afraid I canceled my subscription
to <i>Trucker's Weekly.</i>

84
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,501
That's funny.

85
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,587
You know what's not funny?

86
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,506
You bitches are cutting into our profits.

87
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,675
We Malloys have been running

88
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,636
a maple moonshine business
for generations.

89
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,058
And one of our most lucrative markets
is the college scene.

90
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,102
But, recently, we've been getting wind

91
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:58,357
of a new product that's eating
into our customer base.

92
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:03,946
"Maple Claw."

93
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,532
Let's say that's true...

94
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,952
what exactly would you like us
to do about that?

95
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,205
-Just pull your product.
-[snickers]

96
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:13,915
I don't think so.

97
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,877
See, I can guess who you boys work for.

98
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,549
And you can tell him that Veronica Lodge
and Cheryl Blossom

99
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,177
do not back down from a fight.

100
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,348
Now, if you'll excuse us,

101
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,350
we have bottles to fill.

102
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,770
Don't say we didn't warn you.

103
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,367
-What the hell was that?
-That was a bluff.

104
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,328
Trust me, Cheryl,
this is typical of my father.

105
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,666
Last year, he sent thugs in gargoyle masks
to beat up on Reggie.

106
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,961
This year, it's hillbillies who claim
to produce maple moonshine.

107
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,428
The good news is, both drop-off boxes,
the one at the sheriff's station

108
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,848
and the one upstairs,
are under surveillance, 24/7.

109
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,934
So, maybe we can identify the person
who dropped off this faux snuff film.

110
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,103
Well, there's hours of footage.

111
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,981
Does this place have any popcorn?

112
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,983
[kernels popping]

-Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
-What? Do you recognize someone?

115
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,885
Uh, maybe. But I think I'm gonna check
this lead out alone. Is that cool?

116
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,938
Jughead's working late with Charles.

117
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,357
The videotapes.

118
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,862
Veronica's with Cheryl.

119
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,616
Doing her maple rum thing.

120
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,744
Archie...

121
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,080
why are we here?

122
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:24,962
I don't know.

123
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,925
But it's nice...

124
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,593
right?

125
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,890
It is, but it's not like
we can do anything...

126
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,351
more than this.

127
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,896
What do you mean?

128
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,106
We're just hanging out.

129
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,030
I love Jughead.

130
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,286
And I love Veronica.

131
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,500
But this is nice, right?

132
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,158
What would you say if you were here, Dad?

133
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,539
{\an8}Probably something corny, like:

134
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,082
{\an8}"Follow your heart."

135
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,131
{\an8}The problem is,
I have no idea where it's pointed.

136
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,721
{\an8}And I don't wanna hurt anyone.

137
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,515
{\an8}I'm just--

138
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,478
{\an8}I'm just missing you a lot.

00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,909
This is so unexpected.

144

{\an8}Yeah, what can I say?
It's been a pretty weird year.

145
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,500
{\an8}Hey, I actually wanted to talk to you
about some of those creepy videotapes.

146
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,419
{\an8}You dropped off a couple
at the station, right?

147
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,837
{\an8}I did, yeah.

148
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,174
{\an8}It was just hours and hours
of our house. Nothing new.

149
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,092
There actually was something new
on one of them.

150
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,637
{\an8}It was footage
of someone dressed up as Betty

151
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,097
{\an8}murdering someone dressed up
as me with a rock.

152
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,683
-Oh, my God.
-You don't know anything about that?

153
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,393
What? No, of course not.

154
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,271
{\an8}It's just you're the only person
with a direct connection to Betty and me

155
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,606
who dropped off a tape.

156
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,732
{\an8}I didn't.

157
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,567
{\an8}I swear.

158

I'm just trying to keep my head down
and make it out of Riverdale in one piece.

159

I had a hunch, but it didn't pan out.

186
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,622

that maybe our suspect is not a voyeur.

187

{\an8}Maybe they're a filmmaker.

188

{\an8}Whoever made that video had to know
what they were doing,

00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,726
And, fellas, we are talking
some serious money here.

340
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,812
Maybe if it was like coed,
we could be down.

341
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,024
I think that could be arranged.

342
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,108
[Toni] <i>No freaking way.</i>

343
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,779
I'm not letting your mangy Bulldogs
paw my girlfriend's Vixens

344
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,697
while she's dealing with a maple crisis.

345
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,491
-She would kill me.
-Fine.

346
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,661
If you wanna laugh in the face
of cold hard cash, be my guest.

347
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,247
Hold on a second, Reggie.

348
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,374
I have a counterproposal.

349
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,378
How about the Vixens tickle
the Bulldogs exclusively?

350
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:58,382
And that way the girls will be in charge,
like it should be.

351
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,719
All right, all right!

352
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:08,392
It is time to choose our first contestant.

353
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,227
[all cheering]

354
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:15,315
Our first lucky Bulldog on defense is...

355
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,735
Jimmy!

356
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,991
Okay. And the first Vixen
doing the tickling is...

357
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,201
Audrey!

358
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,413
Okay!

359
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,165
Let the tickle games begin.

360
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,084
[all cheering]

361
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,296
Audrey, Jimmy, follow me
to the Tickle Suite please.

362
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,549
[rock music playing inside pub]

363
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,896
[Hiram] Hunter Malloy.

364
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,234
You threaten my daughter?
You hillbilly scum.

365
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:02,821
Who?

366
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,699
You mean that sweet rum-runner girl?

367
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,367
We tried talking to her.

368
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,704
What can I say? Some tramps need
more of a hands-on approach.

369
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,913
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

370
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,959
-Okay, I'm sorry! I was kidding.
-Face the wall.

371
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,627
Hey, hey, hey.

372
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,422
Don't do it. Please don't do it.

373
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,632
You're Hiram Lodge, right?
I know all about you.

374
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,886
Please, we won't mess with you again.
We'll leave your daughter alone.

375
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,096
We won't disrespect you again,
man, please.

376
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,473
Please.

377
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,101
Thank you. Thank you.

378
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,229
You and your entire clan, you stay away
from my daughter and her friends.

379
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,024
-Are we clear?
-Yes, sir.

380
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,128
[Hunter] You like that, huh?

381
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,384
Where the hell have you been?

382
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,261
Where's Ethel?

383
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,222
At home, with her parents.

384
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,765
I told you that she's not our voyeur.

385
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:12,808
[scoffs]

386
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,144
What is this?

387
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,355
We searched Ethel's house,
and we found it.

388
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,859
Watch it. Then we can talk about whether
you still believe Ethel's innocent.

389
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,668
Mom? Dad?

390
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,802
Daddy?

391
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,513
Oh, my God.

392
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,643
Ow.

393
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,728
What happened, Daddy?

394
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,522
What did you do?

395
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,190
I was weak, <i>mija.</i>

396
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,403
I had one of the Malloy boys in my sights.

397
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,530
I could have taken him out,
but I showed mercy.

398
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,742
A weakness of will
that I quickly came to regret.

399
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,376
Daddy, it's okay.

400
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,088
I'm always here for you.

401
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,724
[Betty] <i>Dear diary,</i>
<i>I hate, hate, hate Cheryl Blossom.</i>

402
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,893
<i>She made Archie kiss her at school today.</i>

403
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,728
<i>She said it's because</i>
<i>they both have red hair,</i>

404
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,104
<i>which makes absolutely no sense.</i>

405
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,480
[Cheryl] Lost in reverie, cousin?

406
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,525
Hey, Cheryl. Did you come
to drop off your yearbook photos?

407
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,528
Yes. And about that,
I'll be needing two pages.

408
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,156
Uh, it's one page per senior.

409
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,451
Yes, and for average humans,
that would suffice.

410
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,413
But I'd like to pay tribute to Jay-Jay.

411
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,540
Okay, fine. Whatever.

412
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,835
What's wrong, cousin?

413
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,171
Trip down memory lane gotten you blue?

414
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,298
Cheryl, give it back.

415
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,133
My goodness!

416
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,094
I had no idea how much you hated me
back in the day.

417
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,599
And all because I snuck a kiss with--

418
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:20,810
Wait.

419
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,647
I was right, wasn't I?

420
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,317
When I said you and Archie were doing
more than just pretending to date

421
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,652
-when Jughead was dead?
-No.

422
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,988
That was obviously pretend.

423
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,701
-But have you...?
-No!

424
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,162
No, we haven't.

425
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:48,463
But I think a part of me has been in love
with Archie for ten years, Cheryl.

426
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,007
False.

427
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,427
You've been in love
with the idea of Archie.

428
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,139
The idea of the perfect romance.

429
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,184
But... that wasn't real.

430
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,103
That was fantasy.

431
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,772
But in this town of nightmares,

432
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,192
you and Jughead found each other.

433
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,111
That's real.

434
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,072
That's maybe even...

435
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,491
dare I say, endgame?

436
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,410
Who knows?

437
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,622
People stray, it happens.

438
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,874
The trick is...

439
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,336
stop straying before anyone gets hurt.

440
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,131
Or even better,
stop before you even start.

441
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,345
[oldies playing over speakers]

442
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,889
[bell jingles]

443
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:44,894
What the hell?

444
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,148
-You've been a naughty boy, Kevin.
-Terry?

445
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,190
You lied to me.

446
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,943
You weren't getting out
of the tickle business.

447
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,737
You were setting up your own shop.

448
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,990
We don't wanna make trouble.

449
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,616
You already did.

450
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,661
So...

451
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,747
[Kevin groans]

452
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,415
...here's how you're going to fix this.

453
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:09,961
You and your buddies will give us
40 percent of your profits.

454
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,590
I'll have to talk to my partners.

455
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,217
[whimpers]

456
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,097
Forty percent.

457
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,935
Or you'll never tickle anyone ever again.

458
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,105
Okay, okay. Terry, I get it. Jeez.

459
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,789
[students chattering]

460
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,752
Hey, Ethel.

461
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,712
Got a minute?

462
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,466
This is a sex tape
of me and my girlfriend,

463
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,260
filmed without our consent
at Stonewall Prep.

464
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,680
And Charles found it
while searching your house.

465
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,516
I stood up for you, Ethel.

466
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,394
I believed you.
And you had this tape the whole time?

467
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,563
-Where did you even get this? From Bret?
-No.

468
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,734
There's a place in the back
of the Blue Velvet Video store.

469
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,236
A secret place.

470
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,822
-It's called the Scarlet Suite.
-Uh-huh.

471
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,491
And what's in this Scarlet Suite?

472
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,159
Tapes.

473
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,955
Rougher ones, weirder ones, homemade.

474
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,416
Like the voyeur tapes?

475
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,459
And darker stuff.

476
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,421
Like... sex tapes.

477
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,048
Maybe even snuff films, I heard.

478
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:39,968
That's where this was?

479
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,348
The video was called <i>Ponytail Playmate.</i>

480
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,559
I thought it sounded fun,

481
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,228
but the second I saw what it was,
I swear I turned it off.

482
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,314
And I kept it because I didn't want
anyone else to get their hands on it.

483
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,941
Please, you have to believe me.

484
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,776
Go to the Scarlet Suite, Jughead.

485
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,487
You'll find what you're looking for.

486
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,492
[Kevin] <i>Shut everything down, ASAP.</i>

487
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,660
We can't.

488
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,912
Our videos are already uploaded.

489
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,664
And we're a hit, bro.

490
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,541
A big, fat, stinking hit.

491
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,293
Then we need to give Terry a cut.

492
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,003
-No.
-Just a taste.

493
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,172
No way. This is our thing, not his.

494
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,674
And I know how to handle Terry.

495
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,926
All I need you to do

496
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,763
is set up a meeting with him
at the Five Seasons.

497
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,849
I got your back, bro, trust me.

498
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:31,978
[bell jingles]

499
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,396
How can I help you fellas?

500
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,107
You can keep out of our way.
We have a warrant to search your store.

501
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,799
[Jughead] What?

502
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,885
What is it, Jughead?

503
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,429
Hey, only 18 and over allowed back here.

504
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,640
Where'd you get this?

505
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:12,393
People come in selling and trading
all kinds of tapes.

506
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:16,189
This is a video of Clifford Blossom
shooting his son Jason Blossom.

507
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,024
It's an actual snuff film.

508
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,452
Hmph.

509
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,749
This is making a lot more sense now.

510
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,003
You boys better have my 40 percent.

511
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,006
[whistles]

512
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:52,308
You know, if you'd asked
for 10 percent... maybe.

513
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,769
But you got greedy.

514
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,063
So, here are our terms.

515
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:58,857
You get zilch.

516
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:04,112
And if any of your goons so much as touch
a hair on my boy Kevin's head,

517
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:08,241

a lot more than your fingers.

518
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,702
You boys just made a big mistake.

00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,837
[Cheryl] <i>I'm so sorry about your dad,</i>

520
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,797
but I got into this business for fun.

521
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,132
To do something fun with you.

522
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,634
And it was, for a while.

523
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,138
But some families have rum in their veins

524
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,307
and other families have maple syrup.

525
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,685
And some blood types
simply aren't compatible.

526
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,565
In other words, partner, I want out.
Effective immediately.

527
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:44,819
Okay.

[school bell rings]

529
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,371
You asked to see us, Mr. Honey?

530
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,583
I did.

531
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,672
Earlier, I received a troubling phone call

532
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,799
alerting me of a...

533
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,303
clandestine, online tickling ring,

534
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,349
apparently being operated by students
from Riverdale High.

535
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,434
You care to comment on this?

536
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,311
Was it some Terry guy who called you?

537
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,939
It doesn't matter who it was, Mr. Mantle.
Is it true?

538
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,484
You know what, Mr. Honey?

539
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,488
Yeah... we did produce the videos.

540
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,867
And there's nothing wrong with it
because it's just tickling.

541
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,662
{\an8}-And what we did doesn't break any laws.
-[Reggie] Yeah.

542
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,331
{\an8}And we were all wearing clothes.

543
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,208
Yes, you were, Mr. Mantle.

544
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,710
In fact, some of you were
wearing Bulldog jerseys

545
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,213
and Vixen practice uniforms,

546
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:49,592
putting you in violation of at least
a dozen legal and copyright laws.

the reputation of this school.

550
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,609
Do I make myself clear?

551
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,069
Yes, sir.

552
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,612
Good.

554
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,877
[Archie] I wanted
to share something with you.

555
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,089
What is it?

556
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,968
It's a song I wrote. For you.

And you love Veronica, don't you?

But then, what has this all been about?

I don't know.

572
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,952
I don't know, maybe it's
because everything's changing

573
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,038
in the next few weeks.

574
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,375
And you and I feel safe with each other.
We always have.

Sounds like you wrote it
for someone special.

584
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,964
Has Veronica heard it yet?

585
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,635
Uh, no, not yet. It's a surprise.

Well, she's gonna love it.

kind of flaky lately...

So, I got
into the University of Pittsburgh.

You did?

You wanna go there? Why?

613
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,907
Because they gave me a scholarship.

And...

615
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,996
because it's close to Carnegie Mellon.

do you think Reggie was right
that it was Terry that called Mr. Honey?

625
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,776
Probably.

I'm sorry to hear that, David.

Well...

634
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,226
it's probably for the best.

635
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,653
I must admit, I'm surprised.

636
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:47,491
I know it's been a while since
I last came to you asking for money,

637
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,329
but this will allow me to buy Cheryl
out of the maple rum business.

638

You refused my help numerous times,
as I recall.

639
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:59,462
Yes. But the reasons I didn't
wanna get into business with you

640
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,797
were your... immoral ways.

What happened when you spared
that Malloy troll...

642
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,929
you said it revealed that you were weak.

643
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,308
But I think it did the exact opposite.
