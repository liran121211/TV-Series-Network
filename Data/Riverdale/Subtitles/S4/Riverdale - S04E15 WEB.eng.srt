00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,534
Hello?

00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,038
This is she.

5
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,378
I understand.

00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,175

What's wrong?

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,811
What was that call about?

11
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,191
It was...

12
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,443
That was Yale.

13
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,819
The admissions office.

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,696
And what did they say?

15
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,951
They were telling me about...

16
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:21,414
a spot that recently opened
in their class of 2024.

17
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,919
And after a second review of
my application, they wanted me to fill it.

18
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,172
The implication being...

19
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,299
that was Jughead's spot.

20
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,636
They didn't say that, but...

21
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,096
How did that make you feel?

22
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:39,849

00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:47,440
It was a night like any other
when Forsythe Pendleton Jones III

25
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,610
or Jughead, affectionately,

26
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,404
went to a school party in the woods.

27
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,573
But unlike his peers,

28
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,408
Jughead never came home.

29
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,996
A few days later, his body was discovered
at the bottom of a ravine.

30
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,376
The mysterious circumstances
around his death

31
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,336
are the subject of this documentary.

00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,967
And this is <i>Murder in a Small Town.</i>

34

As the oldest resident of our town,
tell us, Nana Rose,

35
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,182
when did the darkness begin
to take hold of Riverdale?

36
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:26,604
Riverdale was a town born in blood.

37
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,359
And it has bathed in it ever since.

38
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,570
-Thank you.
-Yup.

Sweet cousin, I am so, so sorry.

Looks like the Blossom family curse
has finally caught up to you.

Lucky me.

Promise me you won't do it.

45
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,135
Do what?

46
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:58,887
Take your own life.

47
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,683
We all know you and Jughead were
Riverdale High's Hamlet and Ophelia.

48
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,728
And I know what it's like
to lose your other half.

00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,106
The despairing thoughts can flood
without warning.

50
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,067
Don't let them drown you.

51
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,069
I promise I won't.

52
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:21,367
Nevertheless, from now on, Betty Cooper,
you're under suicide watch.

53
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,244
Consider me your constant shadow.

54
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:24,996
No.

55
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,874
Please, no. Uh...

56
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:32,003
No. My mom is already being clingy enough
with her documentary. I really...

57
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,549
I just can't have anyone else invading
my personal space right now.

58
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,093
What's first on today's agenda?

59
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,096
I will be going to Stonewall Prep

60
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,307
to gather the rest
of Jughead's belongings.

61
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,143
My convertible is right out front.
I'll drive you.

62
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,981
Fine, just-- You're staying in the car.

63
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,185
Save your tears.

64
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,396
No one's watching.

65
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,068
-Bret.
-You got your wish, Ponytail.

66
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,154
Forsythe isn't going to Yale.

67
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,992
So, I guess it'll just be you and me
in New Haven.

Yeah.

Hermosa, kindly tell me what
you really want or get out of my room.

you are possibly deferring Barnard,

that was positively ID'd as my son.

Dr. Curdle Jr. completed his autopsy
and declared...

99
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,169
the cause of death was blunt force trauma
to the head.

100
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,507
We also got a call a couple of days ago
from a hiker who found a bloody rock

101
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,385
in the woods near
where Jughead was discovered.

102
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,346
It was bagged for evidence

103
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,100
and sent to a lab for testing,
so we'll know more soon.

104
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,019
So, you suspect foul play.

And earlier,
did I hear that you have a new lead?

so I can act on it.

00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,265
My office got an anonymous tip

112
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,268
that you have something personal
that belonged to my son.

113
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,232
Look, I assure you, I have nothing
that belonged to Jughead.

It's his.

00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,747
Isn't it?

118
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:25,963
When Forsythe was expelled,
he threw his tie pin in our faces.

119
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,299
-I guess I forgot I had it.
-You guess?

-Sorry? About what?

00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,976
Sorry we didn't come forward,
but we were afraid.

123
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,312
You're gonna have to be
a lot more specific than that.

124
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,897
We were afraid of her.

125
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,900
We were afraid she'd do to us
what she did to Forsythe.

126

-Who?
-Betty, of course!

00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:58,538
The night of the party,
Bret and I decided to sneak into the woods

128
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,414

129
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,377
Until we saw Betty...

130

holding a rock, standing over Jughead.

131
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,800
And then we saw that she wasn't alone.

132
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,219
She was with those friends of hers.

00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,887

who can back up this story?

136
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,395
Bret can.

137
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,274
He was with me.
He was with me the whole time.

Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper
and Veronica Lodge,

139
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,620
you're under arrest for the cold-blooded
murder of my son, Jughead Jones.

140
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:55,428
This was their move. The Stonies.
We knew that they would do this.

141
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,637
I hope you're right, Betty.

142
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,058
Everything's fine, okay? This is good.
This is where they start tripping up.

Although I wasn't allowed in the room
with the suspects,

159
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,406

promised me exclusive access.

{\an8}I don't remember exactly.

162
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,460

on the ground, bleeding from the head.

-That's enough, FP.

{\an8}My daughter had and has nothing to do
with this mess.

165
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,593
Did you speak to Jughead at all
the night of the party?

166
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,178
You don't have to answer that, Archie.

167
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,390

to the last 20 questions I've asked.

your boy, but I need answers.

{\an8}-He's gotta give me something.
-Legally, he does not.

170
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,231
As his lawyer, I am required

171
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,900
{\an8}to make sure that my client is aware
of his rights.

172
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,151
{\an8}We don't have long.

173
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,780

a few moments with you alone...

00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,657
{\an8}with the security cameras off.

175
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,619
Betty, honey, I know you did it.

176
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,832
{\an8}-Mom, seriously?
-Well, not on purpose. Not premeditated.

177
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,375
{\an8}But...

178
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,506
{\an8}I know what it's like to be driven
by rage and desire.

179
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,842
{\an8}And sometimes things can
just get out of hand.

180
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,970
{\an8}I told you, I didn't do it.
It was the Stonies.

181
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,139
{\an8}Betty, FP has the proof.

182
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:07,351
{\an8}And to be honest,
I was expecting something like this.

183
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,439
But I can't help you
unless you tell me the truth.

184
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,606
{\an8}-Mom...
-[door opens]

185
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,691
{\an8}[Alice clears throat]

186
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,861
{\an8}-[FP] Forensics on the rock came back.
-Oh, no.

187
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,405
And?

188
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,157
Turns out it wasn't blood.

189
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,786
{\an8}It's run-of-the-mill corn syrup,
theatrical stuff used to make fake blood.

190
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,079
So, what does that mean?

191
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,622
{\an8}Betty...

192
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,833
{\an8}you and your friends are free to go.

193
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,671
[beeping over TV]

194
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,967
{\an8}-Put down the controller.
-Hey!

195
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,719
{\an8}Bret, we've got a problem.

196
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,805
{\an8}Betty and her friends were released
from jail,

197
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,766
{\an8}-and the rock tested negative for blood.
-That's, um...

198
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:49,977
{\an8}That's unexpected.

199
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,397
{\an8}Considering we watched Jonathan smear
Jughead's blood on said rock,

200
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,065
{\an8}I'd say it's impossible.

201
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,486
{\an8}Which means either Betty somehow
interfered and switched out

202
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:02,865
{\an8}the bloody rock with a fake one
or Jughead's sheriff daddy is lying.

203
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,202
{\an8}-What's your instinct?
-I don't know. I have to think.

204
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,540
{\an8}Something about all this...

205
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,463
{\an8}[cell phone ringing]

206
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,466
Hello?

207
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,635
{\an8}[Donna] <i>I figured it out, Betty.</i>

208
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,806
{\an8}It's 3 a.m., Donna.
What the hell do you want?

209
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,768
You got too confident.

210
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,062
Overplayed your hand.

211
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,858
{\an8}That rock found by that hiker
wasn't smeared with synthetic blood.

212
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,276
It was real.

213
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,738
{\an8}Which must mean you're working
with Jughead's dad,

214
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,073
{\an8}which made me wonder,

215
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,242
{\an8}why would a sheriff...

216
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,577
father...

217
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,121
{\an8}help the girl who killed his son?

218
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,706
{\an8}<i>He wouldn't.</i>

219
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,001
{\an8}Unless, of course,
Jughead isn't dead at all.

220
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:00,005
You saw his body, Donna.
You and Bret burst into the morgue.

221
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,340
I saw a body.

222
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,511
I never looked into
Forsythe's cold, dead eyes.

223
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,012
I didn't even see his face.

224
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,140
Are you seriously suggesting
I made Jughead pretend to be dead?

225
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,684
It's what I would have done.

226
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,813
In fact, I would have done everything
to make the lies seem real,

227
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:19,108
to buy myself more time
to outwit my enemies.

228
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,151
<i>Now you're keeping Jughead tucked away</i>

229
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,487
while you desperately search for proof

230
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,614
that would tie us to attempted murder.

231
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,284
You're vamping. You won't beat us, Betty.

232
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,120
I am going to implode your little scheme

233
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,498
and lead this investigation
right to your doorstep.

234
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,293
There's no way out of this for you.

235
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,590
-Morning, sweetheart.
-Morning.

236
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,887
Mr. Jones, I know it might be weird,

237
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,598
but I think the time is right
to host a funeral.

238
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,267
We could have a public wake,

239
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,353
here in Jughead's home.

240
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:01,567
It might help everyone who knew him
just to bring some semblance of closure.

241
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,946
If you wanna organize something, Betty,
that'd be all right with me.

242
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,659
[Hermosa]
<i>Well, well, if it isn't the jail bird.</i>

243
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,955
I'm innocent of all charges
and was released within hours.

244
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,417
-I have never killed anyone, Hermosa.
-Maybe not...

245
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,670
but sometimes it's better
to be safe than sorry.

246
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,388
Isn't that your alias?

247
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,853
Oh, I bet you would love
to run me out of town.

248
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
Get me out of the way,
so you can finally swoop in

249
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,899
and take control of the family business.

250
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,738
Well, tough luck.

251
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,326
Hey, guys, it's time for group training.
Where is everyone?

252
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,371
They're, um, not coming.

253
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,289
Why? What's going on?

254
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,085
Everyone's saying that you're a murderer,
that you killed that Jones guy.

255
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,380
Toby, I swear to you,

256
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,382
I would never hurt my best friend.

257
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,219
I did not kill Jughead.
I didn't kill anyone, okay?

258
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,513
-I'm one of the good guys.
-If you say so.

259
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,267
We'll see you later, Archie.

260
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,609
[Alice] So, tell me about your friend,
the late Jughead Jones.

261
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,862
We were really similar in a lot of ways.

262
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,742
We actually spent one night together,

263
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,244
and, um...

264
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,373
it was the moment that cemented
our friendship.

265
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,293
What?

266
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,964
I'm not threated
by what was surely one loveless tryst.

267
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,176
[Alice] And, Cheryl, what are
your feelings on the subject?

268
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,350
I'm sorry I called Jughead a hobo
that one time.

269
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,147
Is that it?

270
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,405
I'm really sorry I called Jughead a hobo
that one time.

271
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
[indistinct chatter]

272
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,749
[door opens]

273
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,006
-You got a lot of nerve coming here.
-Sweet Pea, it's okay.

274
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,716
Mr. Jones said that they could come in.

275
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,806
[Donna] Closed casket.

276
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:39,975
Call me a doubting Thomas,

277
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,728
but that seems like a suspect choice
with such a handsome cadaver.

278
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,105
Classy as ever, Donna.

279
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,233
The funeral home didn't even want us
to have the casket here,

280
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,777
but it's Serpent tradition.

281
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,073
And if you make a scene,
I will throw your ass out.

282
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,827
I wanna thank you for coming today.

283
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,164
I know you all... loved my son.

284
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,336
Things weren't always easy for us.

285
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,213
But my boy was...

286
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,967
always resilient...

287
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,594
and loyal...

288
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,430
and loving.

289
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,225
And...

290
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,526
I'll go.

291
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,410
As many of you know,

292
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:46,333
Jughead was a fan of crime fiction.

293
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,878
Detective stories.

294
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,299
So, to honor him,
I'd like to read a passage

295
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,845
from one of his favorite
Sherlock Holmes short stories:

296
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,805
"The Final Problem."

297
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,102
"An examination by experts
leaves little doubt

298
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:10,899
that a personal contest between Holmes
and Moriarty ended in their reeling over,

299
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,986
locked in each other's arms.

300
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:19,616
Any attempt at recovering
the bodies was absolutely hopeless,

301
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,577
and there, deep down,

302
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,582
in that dreadful cauldron
of swirling water and seething foam,

303
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,959
will lie...

304
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,505
Will lie for all time
the most dangerous criminal

305
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,343
and the foremost champion of the law
of their generation."

306
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,228
[sighs]

307
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,898
[clears throat]

308
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,399
Mr. Mayor.

309
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,567
FP.

310
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,572
Look, this is a difficult time.

311
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,034
And this case, it's just...
It's too personal for you.

312
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:06,580
It's too painful, so why don't you take
a leave of absence from being sheriff?

313
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,085
You came to my son's funeral to fire me?

314
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,046
Of course not.

315
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,177
Go to hell, Hiram.

316
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,014
I quit.

317
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,522
You must really miss your brother.

318
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,567
When was the last time you saw him?

319
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,403
He isn't really dead, is he?

320
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,447
Donna, are you serious?

321
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,866
This is Jughead's little sister.
You're accosting her?

322
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,037
Oh, come on, Betty, you and I both know
that this is all an act.

323
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,956
Bitch, I'm done with you. Let's go.

324
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,000
Do it. Bret, do it!

325
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,130
-What do you think you're doing?
-She told me to do it.

326
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,884
-You preppies don't know when to quit.
-Okay, calm down. He's not worth it.

327
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,511
He was leaving anyway.

328
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:08,725
Donna, control your little pet, okay?
He seems to have lost his cool.

329
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:33,208
I don't know what kind of second-rate
detective this former Sheriff Jones is,

330
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,379
but I took it upon myself to do
a little investigating and...

331
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,006
guess what I discovered.

332
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,801
Please, enlighten me.

333
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,679
You, Betty and Archie

334
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,516
all told your parents drastically
different versions of what happened

335
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,727
the night of Jughead's death.

336
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,440
How did you find out about that?

337
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,485
I simply ingratiated myself
to the right people, of course.

338
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,781
Mrs. Andrews,
I'm Veronica's sister, Hermosa.

339
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,659
-What can I do for you?
-I was hoping I could ask your legal help

340
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,038
in drawing up some contracts
for one of my clubs down in Miami.

341
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,124
-I could pay up front.
-Come on in.

342
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:20,339
Ms. Smith, I wanted to offer you
and Mr. Jones my deepest condolences.

343
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,256
Thank you.

344
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,383
-May I come in?
-Of course.

345
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,553
I knew I was on to something.

346
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,058
Now, I want the truth.

347
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,311
Or what, my dear sister?

348
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,317
Or I sit <i>Papi,</i> Mrs. Andrews
and Alice Smith down at the same table,

349
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,069
so they can compare notes.

350
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,115
[knock on door]

351
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,700
Hey.

352
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,246
So, is it true?

353
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,165
Is what true?

354
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,709
That Jughead, you know, is alive?

355
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,794
What?

356
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,924
Kevin, that's insane,
not to mention cruel.

357
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,301
I'm sorry,
it's just what people are saying.

358
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:10,806
Who? What people? Seriously, tell me.
Who is saying that Jughead is alive?

359
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,057
Everyone.

360
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,560
But I first heard it from
that Stonewall Prep girl at the funeral.

361
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,939
-Do you mean Donna Sweett?
-Yes, that was her name.

362
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:22,609
She was talking about
how it was all some elaborate ruse.

363
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,282
[Alice] Why do you think these stories
about Jughead faking his death

364
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,742
are gaining so much traction?

365
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:35,080
I think because we just wanna believe
that it's true.

366
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,208
Now that I think of it,
I remember freshman year,

367
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,086
we were assigned
<i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer </i>to read.

368
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:46,133
I barely knew Jughead at the time,
but he was obsessed with that book,

369
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,845
specifically the chapter
in which Tom fakes his own death

370
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,390
to see how the people of his hometown
would react to his passing.

371
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,186
I remember him in class saying,
"Imagine that."

372
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,815
Imagine being able to attend
your own funeral.

373
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,442
[Alice] Reggie,
what do you make of the rumors

374
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,236
that Jughead Jones is somehow alive?

375
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,197
I'm angered by them, Mrs. S.

376
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,950
It pisses me off.

377
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,785
Yeah, of course,

378
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,329
because you deeply miss your friend.

379
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,790
What? No.

380
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,294
I'm mad because that weirdo beat me

381
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,046
by pulling off the most epic senior prank
of all time.

382
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,591
Faking your own death?

383
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,385
That's legendary.

384
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,304
He'll never be forgotten.

385
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,388
[door bells jingle]

386
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,473
[oldies music playing over speakers]

387
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,185
-Hey.
-Hi.

388
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,395
I got here as soon as I could.
What's going on?

389
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:43,023
I just don't think
I can do this anymore, Arch.

390
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,275
I keep waiting for Jug to come back,

391
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,402
but he doesn't and he won't.

392
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,572
He won't ever come back.

393
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,368
And I don't know
how I'm supposed to keep going.

394
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,208
Day by day, Betty.

395
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,460
We'll get through this. Together.

396
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:10,467
I just don't know why everyone at school
is saying that he's still alive, he isn't.

397
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,055
These crazy rumors are just making it
so much more painful.

398
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,709
[Archie] Betty, you okay?

399
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,588
You wanna talk about it?

400
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,259
I can't do this, Arch.

401
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,095
I feel so alone.

402
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,055
You're not.

403
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,933
Betty, I promise. I know how hard this is.

404
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,895
I just wanna feel... good.

405
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,064
Even for just a few moments.

406
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,443
I'm here for you, Betty.

407
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,154
I always have been.

408
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,617
Yeah, you have, haven't you?

409
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,757
[clicking]

410
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:38,763
Oh, grief,

411
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,641
you wicked, heartless aphrodisiac.

412
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,437
Destroyer of endgames and worlds.

413
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,233
Why, oh, why am I always the one
to catch these two kissing cads?

414
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,319
[cell phones chiming]

415
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,953
Andrews and Cooper.

416
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,538
What?

417
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,170
[door opens]

418
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,215
Cheryl.

419
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,219
Is everything okay?
Did something happen with Toni?

420
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:22,098
Veronica, I had a text drafted
and ready to send to you,

421
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,059
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

422
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:27,228
-You deserve to be told in person.
-What are you talking about?

423
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,941
Take a moment.
Prepare yourself for devastation.

424
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,153
Come on, we're maple partners.
Just please tell me what's going on.

425
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,245
Son of a bi--

426
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,333
Betty? Really, Archie?

427
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,335
Of all people? Betty?

428
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,213
-How could you do this to me?
-Ronnie, what--?

429
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,590
Don't play innocent with me,
Archie Andrews.

430
00:27:55,673 --> 00:28:00,345
Kissing my best friend in the music room
where you and I had our fun?

431
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,765
Why should I be surprised?
That's your special place, isn't it?

432
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,475
It's where you take all your women.

433
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,645
Me, Josie, Ms. Grundy, and now Betty.

434
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:14,025
And shame on you for taking advantage
of our friend when she is grieving...

435
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,319
and at her most vulnerable.

436
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,114
B, I need you to know,

437
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,490
I do not blame you.

438
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,328
It's my fault.
I'm the one who started it. I--

439
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,415
I kissed Archie. I'm so sorry.

440
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,874
Sorry?

441
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,294
You're sorry?

442
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,801
You scheming, two-faced bitch,

443
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,553
Betty Cooper.

444
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,555
You know what?

445
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,682
You two deserve each other.

446
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,893
So, burn in hell, the both of you.

447
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,188
That's right. You tell them, girl.

448
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,449
[Alice] So, why do you think people are
so ready to accept the fact

449
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,992
that Archie and Betty are dating?

450
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:09,330
I think there were
a lot of closeted Barchie stans out there

451
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,915
who have been waiting for this moment.

452
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,127
We just hoped that it's true.

453
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,880
Sounds like you're one of these stans.

454
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,759
Oh, no, don't get me wrong.
I support Betty and whoever she likes.

455
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,637
There's a lot of people who don't think
Bughead should have happened.

456
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,057
It was always supposed
to be Betty and Archie.

457
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,018
It was like it was their destiny.

458
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:31,978
I see.

459
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,190
And what about this rumor
that Jughead is still alive?

460
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,781
If Betty and Archie being together
proves anything,

461
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,658
it's that Jughead is definitely dead.

462
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,328
I know your daughter pretty well.

463
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,207
Not even she's crazy enough to date Archie
if Jughead were still around.

464
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,295
[zipper zipping]

465
00:29:59,130 --> 00:29:59,964
Hi, Betty.

466
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,760
Here all alone?

467
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,639
Why? Are you here to kill me?

468
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,557
Just so you know...

469
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:15,396
you may have this town, your school
and all your friends fooled, but not me.

470
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,651
You're either building a case against me
and my classmates

471
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,820
or trying to exonerate yourself.

472
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,824
And Jughead is alive
and helping you behind the scenes.

473
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,451
I just don't know where you're hiding him.

474
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:29,953
Yet.

475
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:30,870
Donna...

476
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:37,377
we can't keep having the same conversation
over and over again, okay?

477
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,339
You're obsessed.
Seriously, it is not healthy.

478
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,800
It's fine.

479
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,802
I didn't expect you to just tell me.

480
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,513
But I know he's close by.

481
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,057
Somewhere you two can be alone.

482
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,560
Know how I know?

483
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,274
Because I saw that sex tape
of yours and...

484
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:03,361
Yowza. Based on the contents,
you can't go two hours,

485
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,363
let alone two days without it.

486
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,658
You are an actual monster.

487
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,785
And you are a nymphomaniac

488
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,621
who is going to trip up sooner
rather than later.

489
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,709
And I'll be there to watch you fall.

490
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,425
[Alice] <i>And that's when you believe</i>
<i>Donna started following you.</i>

491
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,760
She had fixated on me.

492
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,471
She was convinced
that I was sneaking around.

493
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,142
Which was true.

494
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,896
I... had been visiting Dilton's bunker.

495
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,232
<i>It became a nightly ritual.</i>

496
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,610
<i>First, stop at Pop's for dinner.</i>

497
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,155
<i>Then I'd head to the woods alone.</i>

498
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,505
-Gotcha!
-[Betty] What the hell?

499
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,840
Oh, my God. Donna?

500
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,887
Get out of here, you pervert!

501
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,850
[Alice] And how long have you been meeting
with Archie in the bunker?

502
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,399
Kind of just started up after...

503
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,693
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Elizabeth.

504
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,196
I promise you'll feel better
once you tell the truth.

505
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:15,743
In that case...

506
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:20,915
before you hear it from someone else, Mom,
I need to tell you something.

507
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,835
Off the record.

508
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:26,879
Okay, honey.

509
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,842
Well, as it turns out,

510
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,723
this is not simply a story
about a murder in a small town.

511
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,141
No.

512
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,727
It's a story about friendship

513
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,478
and conspiracy.

514
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,232
And what happens
when those two things dovetail

515
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,110
into a highly sophisticated cover-up.

516
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,115
So, our little gambit worked.

517
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,910
Between the look I saw
on Donna's face in the bunker

518
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,204
and your performance
in the student lounge...

519
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,999
You can thank
Helen Mirren's MasterClass for that.

520
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,378
Though I just have to ask.

521
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,800
When you were pretending
to be with Betty...

522
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,180
you didn't feel anything,

523
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:18,973
did you?

524
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,349
Ronnie...

525
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,561
when will you learn?

526
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:25,938
You are,

527
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,900
now and forever,

528
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,902
the only girl for me.

529
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:46,084
[Betty] Even by our standards,
this was a pretty crazy week.

530
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,170
Well, pretending to be dead is one thing,

531
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,924
but hiding under a cot
in this sex bunker of death...

532
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:57,303
while you make out with Archie
just to convince a bunch of evil preppies

533
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,763
that I did die?

534
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:02,100
Yeah, definitely cracks
the top-10 craziest things.

535
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,434
But it worked.

536
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,438
And now Donna will start doubting herself.

537
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,566
This whole thing is a game of confidence.

538
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,819
And what happens
when you don't have confidence?

539
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,404
Mistakes are made.

540
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,990
And bonus,
you'll have all this uninterrupted time

541
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,077
to figure out how the pieces
of the mystery fit together.

542
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,663
An additional bonus is
that they won't come to try

543
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,915
-and finish my botched braining.
-Mm-hm.

544
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,042
I never thought I'd say it,

545
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,170
but God bless that beanie
for cushioning the blow,

546
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,755
even just a little bit.

547
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,636
Speaking of that...

548
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,098
close your eyes and hold out your hand.

549
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,272
Open.

550
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,361
When did you have time to do this?

551
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,281
[laughs] We all manage our stress
in different ways.

552
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,449
My mom had her documentary,

553
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,202
I taught myself how to knit.

554
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,041
Are you sure telling
your mom was a good idea?

555
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,628
Well, considering Charles,

556
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,756
your dad, Jellybean, Dr. Curdle Jr.,

557
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,884
and Mrs. Andrews are all in on it,

558
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,136
yeah, it felt like
the prudent thing to do.

559
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,846
Yeah, that's fair enough.

560
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,518
When you kissed Archie, none
of those old feelings came back, did they?

561
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,187
Jughead...

562
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,480
No.

563
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,108
Of course not, okay? Don't be silly.

564
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,571
You know you're the only man for me.

565
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,617
And our scheming can take one night off,
don't you think?

566
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,427
[Alice] So, I understand you made quite
the public spectacle

567
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,512
over the Archie and Betty romance.

568
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:08,226
Um, I think you mean I gave
an amazing performance.

569
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,021
But weren't you afraid that something
might actually spark between them?

570
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,648
I trust Archie.

571
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,816
And I trust Betty.

572
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,945
To be honest,
the thought never even crossed my mind.

[Alice] The question still remains:

584
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,175
Why did you go
to such extraordinary lengths

585
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,513
to convince the preppies and pretty much
the whole town of Riverdale

586
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,931
that Jughead was dead?

587
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,809
Because they were trying to pin
the murder on me.

588
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,605
And because if they knew
Jughead was still alive,

589
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,859
they would circle the wagons
and lock down tight.

590
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:45,448
And we were and still are locked
in a battle of psychological warfare

591
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,574
with the Stonies.

592
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:51,037
The only way that we would be able to pin
the attempted murder of Jughead on them

593
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,748
is if we forced the Stonies to crack.

594
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,418
You seem quite confident that they will.

00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,213
No, I can't be certain, but...

596
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,550
after the last few days,

597
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,636
I have a feeling they'll be fracturing
any minute now.

Stop what you're doing, Bret.

599
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,769
I have proof that Jughead's alive.

600
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,355
Whoa, Donna, slow down.
How can you be so sure?

601
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,107
I tailed Betty to an apocalyptic bunker,

602
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,443
where she sloppily swapped saliva

603
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,362
with that carrot-topped Neanderthal.

604
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,821
It was all a charade.

605
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,240
They had takeout from Pop's,

606
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,201
that little diner
that Jones was obsessed with.

607
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,827
And what? There's an extra burger?

608
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:35,664
Archie's built like a superhero.
I'm sure he could wolf half a dozen.

609
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,750
Forget about the burger!

610
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,003
There was not one, not two,

but three milkshakes in evidence.

612
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,679
I am certain that Jones must have
heard me sneaking down the ladder

613
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,557
and he hid so as not to get caught.

614
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,893
