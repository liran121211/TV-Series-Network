-[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:
-I'm Charles. Your brother.

2
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:15,890
Hey. Your days of exploiting kids
to do your dirty work ends tonight.

3
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,727
Didn't you say we'd turn this place
into a community center?

4
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,895
-Jughead?
-Are you my roommate?

5
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,607
-So much for a new start.

00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,991
[whirring]

7
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,119
What--?

8
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,203
What is this?

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,539
Fast-forward.

10
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,177
It's literally six hours of our house.

11
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,139
Why would somebody do that?

12
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,558
Film it and then leave the evidence
on the front doorstep?

13
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,895
To unsettle you,
let you know you're being watched.

14
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,064
Yeah, but why a videotape?

15
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,316
Why something so anachronistic?

16
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,817
Maybe it's just a prank.

17
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,446
[Jughead] <i>If it was,</i>
<i>it was an elaborate one.</i>

18
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,075
<i>Over the next few days, then weeks,</i>

19
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:19,829
<i>more and more citizens of Riverdale</i>
<i>received copies of similar tapes.</i>

20
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:24,209
<i>Footage of their houses...</i>
<i>being watched from across the street.</i>

21
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,002
<i>For hours...</i>

22
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,588
<i>upon hours.</i>

23
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,967
{\an8}<i>No messages were included</i>
<i>with the videos...</i>

24
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,930
{\an8}<i>which somehow made the whole thing</i>
<i>even more disturbing.</i>

25
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,352
<i>So that by Halloween,</i>
<i>the entire town was on edge.</i>

26
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,021
<i>Who would get the next tape?</i>
<i>What do they mean?</i>

27
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,648
<i>Were they a warning?</i>

28
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,149
<i>A test?</i>

29
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,234
[FP] Another one?

30
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,610
Keep me updated.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,531
-The Muggses also got a tape.
-Ooh.

32
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,826
I'll get over there and get an interview
with them for tonight's broadcast.

33
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,286
That's the fringe benefit of living
with the sheriff.

34
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,206
I get the inside scoop
before any other reporter.

35
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,417
-[FP] Mm-hm.
-[Alice] Mm-hm. [giggles]

36
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,586
Hey, Betty, is Jug still coming home
for Halloween?

37
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,088
Yeah, that's the plan.

38
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,841
We're gonna hand out candy
and watch scary movies.

39
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,009
Oh.

40
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,804
-Why don't you invite your brother?
-Half brother.

41
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,639
Charles doesn't know anybody in town.

42
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,474
Okay, well, why is he still in town?

43
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,310
He's helping me with the tapes
and a couple other cases.

44
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,855
It's the one good thing that came out
of this nightmare.

45
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,898
It brought the entire family together.

46
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,152
Except for Jughead,
who's at Stonewall Prep.

47
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,488
And Polly,
who's in a facility being deprogrammed.

48
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,825
I think it's time, Cheryl.

49
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,620
-Time? Time for what?
-To say goodbye to Jason.

50
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,791
You've been promising me for weeks.

51
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,336
I know. And I'm going to.

52
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,465
But I can't do it before Halloween.
It's our favorite holiday.

53
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:59,596
Babe, then you're gonna say the same thing
about Thanksgiving, and then Christmas.

54
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,056
You're not gonna let this go, are you?

55
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,685
Okay, fine.

56
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,023
We'll rebury him on the Blossom
family plot on the grounds of Thornhill.

57
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,277
But I'm warning you,
he's not going to like this.

58
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,322
I'll get the shovels.

59
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,543
Moose, why do you have this?

60
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,631
Oh. Just thinking maybe I'm done
with high school.

61
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,676
I mean, I'm 18. And the Army doesn't care
who you are or where you're from.

62
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,263
Dude, what Bret did,
spreading that article about you,

63
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,057
was a real scumbag move.

64
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,143
But you can't let him win.
He wants you to leave.

65
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,145
Hell, he wants both of us to leave.

66
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,980
Let's not give him that satisfaction,
okay?

67
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,983
It's easy for you to say, Jug.
They're not calling you Gargoyle Boy.

68
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,657
[students chattering]

69
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,590
Hey. You and you.

70
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:22,011
I made it very clear that there will be
no costumes on school property.

71
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,681
Now, take off the masks. Come on.
Hand it over.

72
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,890
Get to class.

73
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,184
[Veronica] <i>B, you okay?</i>

74
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,355
Um, I'm not gonna lie.
I'm a little on edge this Halloween.

75
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:36,025
I mean, people are dressed up
like the Black Hood and the Gargoyle King.

76
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,529
And there are those damn videotapes.

77
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:40,989
I'm with you, girl.

78
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,699
Ever since my dad broke
into the Pembrooke,

79
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,200
I've been looking over my shoulder.

80
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,412
-And if the town's got a voyeur now--
-[Reggie] What's up, guys?

81
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,499
Who wants to TP Mr. Honey's office with me
tomorrow night?

82
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,629
Reggie, it's senior year. We're seniors.

83
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,551
Exactly. It's senior year. This is
our last Halloween at Riverdale High.

84
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,177
-I'm in, Reggie.
-Huh?

85
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,263
What? Kev. Why?

86
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,599
Honey gave me a week's detention for going
to the bathroom without a hall pass.

87
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,476
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Mm-hm.

88
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,519
[Munroe] Yo, Red.

89
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,688
I just got some distressing news.

90
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,774
You remember that crew that was working
out of the arcade? Dodger and his boys?

91
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,485
He's still pissed that he got beat up
and jumped by--

92
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,488
That, uh, vigilante.

93
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,492
They're planning
on wilding Halloween night.

94
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,036
Looking to bust some heads.

95
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,455
Damn it. The kids in the neighborhood
will be sitting ducks.

96
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,874
-We gotta do something.
-Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

97
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,209
Maybe keeping the center open
later than usual.

98
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,962
Why don't you guys host a Halloween party
at the community center?

99
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:42,091
That'll keep the kids off the streets, out
of harm's way. Don't worry about costumes.

100
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,926
One of my gal pals in New York,
Katy Keene,

101
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,304
she goes to the High School
of the Performing Arts

102
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,805
and is an amazing designer.

103
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,850
-Let me see what she can whip up for you.
-Yeah. Sounds great.

104
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,103
[Chipping] What about you, Jughead?

105
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,523
Which of your favorite horror writers
did you bring in to share?

106
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,360
I brought the collected works
of H.P. Lovecraft.

107
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,697
[chuckles] There's nothing scary
about Lovecraft.

108
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,325
Says the guy that brought in "The Raven"?

109
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,662
My favorite Poe story
is "The Cask of Amontillado."

110
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:15,208
That's the one where the guy is sealed
behind a wall, behind bricks,

111
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,168
and then is never seen
or heard from again.

112
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,589
Now, that'd be a horrible way to go.
Don't you think, Forsythe? To just vanish?

113
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,842
Like the Stonewall Four, you mean?

114
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,845
I'm betting Forsythe could make it
the Stonewall Five.

115
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,139
We're overdue for a vanishing.

116
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,605
[Jughead] <i>Who or what are</i>
<i>the Stonewall Four?</i>

117
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,151
Four students,
all of whom went to this school,

118
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,069
all of whom...

119
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,030
disappeared without a trace.

120
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,158
-All at the same time?
-No.

121
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,869
Uh, over 30 years or so.

122
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,956
And they didn't really go missing.
They dropped out.

123
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:57,875
What are you saying?

124
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,211
The Stonewall Four is an urban legend.

125
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,880
Jughead, it's campus lore. That's all.

126
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:11,013
[Toni] <i>I am so proud of you, babe.</i>
<i>You are the strongest person that I know.</i>

127
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,433
Well, it's not the first time
I've had to bury my brother,

128
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,643
but hopefully it's the last.

129
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,895
Well, it was the right thing to do.

130
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,441
Cheryl, what's that?

131
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,070
Oh, no.

132
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,323
-I was afraid of this.
-Of what?

133
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:34,370
Jason's ghost. I think he's mad at us
for what you made me do.

134
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,838
I know exactly where this is going.

135
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,256
The trash.

136
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,436
What are you reading, Jones?

137
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,814
[sighs] <i>The Stonewall Sentinel.</i>

138
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,817
Coffee? It's fresh brewed.

139
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,027
Yeah. Thanks.

140
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,948
Searching for something in particular?

141
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:16,454
Like... articles about
the Stonewall Four, perhaps?

142
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,331
How'd you guess?

143
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,874
You love a good mystery, don't you?

144
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,626
I've searched through years of articles,

145
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,170
and so far, there is nothing
about disappearing students.

146
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,799
My next stop is the town newspaper office
and the police station.

147
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,053
Jones, you okay?

148
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,515
Yeah. Uh...

149
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,434
I think I...

150
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,978
{\an8}I think I need some air.

151
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:43,856
No.

152
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,359
You need to lie down.

153
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,323
[heart beating]

154
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,328
Say hello to the Stonewall Four for us.

155
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,382
Okay, opening my eyes now.

156
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,510
{\an8}We look ridiculous.

157
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,971
{\an8}You look adorable, both of you.

158
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,055
{\an8}What are our names again?

159
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,392
{\an8}According to Katy, you, Archie,
are Pureheart the Powerful,

160
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,394
{\an8}and you, Munroe, are the Shield.

161
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,938
Right on.
Veronica, you need a ride to the center?

162
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,774
No, I'll take an Uber.
I still have to do some cleanup over here.

163
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,443
{\an8}But save a dance for me, Pureheart,
won't you?

164
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,329
{\an8}Why aren't you in a costume?

165
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,585
{\an8}I am. I'm dressed as Laurie Strode.

166
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,753
Who?

167
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,257
{\an8}From the original<i> Halloween... </i>movie?

168
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,677

00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,015
-What?
-Some of the kids wanted to go home.

343
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,599
Went to see if everything was cool and--

344
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,893
-And?
-There's trouble out front.

345
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,603
Hey, wait. Can I bounce?

346
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:58,275
Hell, no. You're staying here until the
party's over, then I'm walking you home.

347
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,610
[door opens]

348
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,196
[Archie] Hey!

349
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,615
I told you to get out of here.

350
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,826
Nah, it doesn't work that way.

351
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,413
That crap gym of yours might be
private property, but this lot isn't.

352
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,959
That's it. I'm done playing.

353
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,252
Yeah, you do that, son.

354
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,671
Come here and get your ass shot.

355
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,384
That'll make our Halloween, right, boys?

356
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,348
[line ringing]

357
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,767
Come on, come on.

358
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,268
[line beeps]

359
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,021
Mr. Jones, it's Archie. Can you do me
a favor and swing by the gym?

360
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,607
We got a bunch of kids here
and some punks with guns out front.

361
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,524
Let me know.

362
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,569
What do we do in the meantime?

363
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,281
We keep the party going
as late as we have to.

364
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,160
[Cheryl] I call upon the invisible forces
all around us

365
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,872
to aid and guide us through
this communication with the spirit world.

366
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,335
Is the entity inside this doll present?

367
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,725
Okay, come on, Cheryl. Stop moving it.

368
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,103
I would, Tee-Tee, except I'm not.

369
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,814
I swear.

370
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,650
Spirit... what is thy name?

371
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:35,455
I know you're upset that I made you bury
your dead brother's corpse,

372
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,790
but this is so messed up.

373
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,500
I already told you, it's not me.

374
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,753
It's Jay-Jay's ghost self
trying to engage with us.

375
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,840
This is not Jason, Cheryl.

376
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,259
He's not moving this board.

377
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,344
Antoinette's right.

378
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,930
It's not Jason.

379
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,766
It's Julian.

380
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,145
What do you mean, Nana?

381
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,105
Who's Julian?

382
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:04,568
Your mother held three babies in her womb.

383
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,988
Julian was to be your triplet.

384
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,825
But in the end,
only you and Jason were born

385
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:16,413
because, as the midwife explained it,

386
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,665
you, Cheryl...

387
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,669
had absorbed the third one.

388
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:25,964
Eaten it.

389
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,595
That-- That can't possibly be true.

390
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,431
Oh, Penelope was devastated.

391
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:40,854
So she procured this doll
and reared it alongside the two of you...

392
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,399
until you were no longer infants.

393
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,526
At which point,

394
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,488
Julian was retired...

395
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,116
to the attic.

396
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,330
So, now that the doll's back,

397
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,292
the spirit of Julian
is haunting Thistlehouse?

398
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,252
What other explanation
could there possibly be?

399
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,173
That you and Nana Rose
are working together.

400
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,508
And to what end
would Nana and I be colluding?

401
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,885
I don't know, babe.

402
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,930
To make me realize that things were better
when Jason was here?

403
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,266
So we dig him back up
and park him at the kitchen table.

404
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,560
Back here in the chapel
would be acceptable.

405
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:29,819
And if we did bring Jason back home...

406
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,781
would this haunting stop?

407
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,367
Could we get rid of this creepy-ass doll
once and for all

408
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,202
and bury him in Jason's grave?

409
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,038
Yes, Tee-Tee. I agree to your terms.

410
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:49,714
You know, this persona
that you've cultivated, Mr. Mantle,

411
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,343
this prankster, this class clown,

412
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,765
has made it impossible for your peers
and your teachers to take you seriously.

413
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,232
Do you think this has anything to do
with your father abusing you?

414
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,401
What?

415
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,028
People won't notices the bruises
or the pain

416
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,406
if they're laughing at one of your jokes.

417
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,615
Is that the thinking?

418
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,035
Because the thing is...

419
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,539
they're not laughing with you, Mr. Mantle.

420
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,000
They're laughing at you.

421
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,339
Now, you consider that
as you clean up my office

422
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,634
and you leave it exactly as you found it.

423
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,475
We haven't talked much
since everything went down with the Farm.

424
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,228
Haven't we?

425
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,190
You have every right to be wary of me.

426
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:55,113
Starting with the fact that you let Mom
walk right into the lion's den with Edgar.

427
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,533
Let the record show,
when I reconnected with Alice,

428
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,828
she found out I worked with the FBI.
She wanted to go undercover.

429
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,414
To help Polly. To get a story.

430
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,416
What about you?

431
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,502
What do you want?

432
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,968
I guess I've, um...

433
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:21,056
I've always wanted to be a part
of a real family.

434
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,102
But I know that that takes time.

435
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,147
[phone ringing]

436
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,902

Just, uh, keep him talking, okay?

437
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:38,990

00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,241
<i>Hello again, Betty.</i>

439
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,410
Who is this?

440
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,870
<i>Don't play dumb.</i>

441
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,372
Sorry.

442
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,751
I just have been getting
a lot of prank calls tonight,

443
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,670
pretending to be... you.

444
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,882
I mean, it is Halloween
and I do live in the Murder House, right?

445
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,342
<i>You're testing my patience.</i>

446
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,511
You remember Halloween, don't you?

447
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,474
We used to go trick-or-treating...
as a family?

448
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,518
You, me, Mom, Polly.

449
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,813
We'd walk up and down Elm Street.

450
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:10,897
<i>I remember.</i>

451
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,859
Then when we got home,
we would go through our bags of treats.

452
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,822
You didn't want us to eat the apples,
you thought there might be razor blades.

453
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,618
Which is pretty funny
all things considered, huh?

454
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,122
<i>-Elizabeth.</i>
-Bye, you sicko.

455
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,376
Did you trace it? The number?

456
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,631

457
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,717
What is it?

458
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,303
Where is the call coming from?

459
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:44,806
Um...

460
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:50,437
It's coming
from Shady Grove Treatment Center,

461
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,148
where your sister's been staying.

462
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,861
Polly has been prank-calling me?

463
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,113
Yeah.

464
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,616
I'll call the main line at Shady Grove
and see how she got access to a phone.

465
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,784
No, no, no. Wait.

466
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,538

to one of your patients, please.

<i>-Name of patient?</i>
-Polly Cooper.

00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,633

<i>One moment please.</i>

[Polly] <i>Edgar? Is it really you?</i>

474
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,268
No, bitch. It's your sister.

<i>-What?</i>
-Edgar is worm food.

476
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,398

<i>to be Edgar?</i>

478

You know, I wish that I could say
tonight's been particularly insane

515
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,558
[whimpering]

516
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,186
Eddie! Eddie!

517
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:03,314
I need an ambulance now.
El Royale Boxing Club. Right now!

518
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,025
[indistinct radio chatter]

519
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:06,943
You're okay.

520
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,197
[Charles] Hey, I've been thinking. Um...

521
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,450
Given how well you handled yourself
with the Farm at the motel,

522
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,705
I think you'd make an excellent candidate
for the Junior FBI training program.

523
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,749
An FBI program for high schoolers?

524
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,754
-Is that actually a thing? Hm.
-It is.

525
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,467
We could work together trying to
figure out who's sending these videotapes.

526
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,470
You know this town a whole lot better
than I do.

527
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:36,931
That's true.

528
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,185
Will you consider it at least?

529
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,409
Looks good, Mr. Mantle.

530
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,289
So, can I go home?
I mean, it's already morning.

531
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,795
As long as we understand each other,
we can walk out of here together.

532
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,430
What the hell? Bella?

533
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,140
Bella!

534
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,809
[gasps] What happened to my car?!

535
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,022
It's such a shame when someone
disrespects your property, isn't it?

536
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:26,981
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

537
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,776
I wonder who did this.

538
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,030
Probably hooligans having
some Halloween fun.

539
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,284
Would you like a ride, Mr. Mantle?

540
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,120
No. No, thank you.

541
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,539
Well...

542
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,125
get home safe.

543
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,966
You're home now, Jay-Jay.

544
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,427
For good.

545
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,349
All is right in the world.

546
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,727
Isn't it, my love?

547
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,105
Yep.

548
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,358
Everything's back to normal.

549
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,030
[creaking]

550
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,219
[door creaking]

551
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,638
[door shuts]

552
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,516
Hey! Hey.

553
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,018
Help! Help!

554
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,186
I'm trapped!

555
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,313
Help me! Help!

556
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,942
[creaking]

557
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,490
Mr. Jones.

558
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,830
Good morning. I, uh...
I see you've been had.

559
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,876
Mis-- Mr. Chipping.

560
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,754
What--? Where--?

561
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:20,136
I'm always amazed at my students' antics.
How they get extra creative at Halloween.

562
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,387
Creative?

563
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,307
Don't take it personally, Jughead.

564
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,227
It's a Stonewall Prep tradition.

565
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,354
It means you belong now.

566
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:33,983
Belong to what?

567
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,818
To us, of course.

568
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:41,157
Here is your phone.
You have a lot of missed texts and calls.

569
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,784
Did you know about this?

570
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,412
Absolutely not.

571
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,501
-What was even the point of this?
-It's a bit of Halloween fun. That's all.

572
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,670
What, we go too far?

573
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:01,052
Well, in that case,
you could always just leave.

574
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:04,639
No.

575
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:06,766
I'm good.

576
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,395
Happy Halloween, kids.

577
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,275
-[Archie] How you feeling, Eddie?
-Like I got shot in the leg.

578
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,446
The doctor said it was just a flesh wound.

579
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,617
You got really lucky, Eddie.
It could have been a lot worse.

580
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:28,329
If Dodger and his crew did this,
we can help you.

581
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,790
-Me, Munroe, Sheriff Jones.
-Help how?

582
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,878
The last thing I need is for these guys
to think that I snitched.

583
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,131
Especially since you took away
my switchblade.

584
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,926
That's not gonna protect you
from guys like Dodger.

585
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,970
But Munroe and I will.

586
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,931
Come hang with us at the center.
They won't step foot in there ever again.

587
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,225
Okay, then what happens
when the center closes at 10?

588
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,268
Where do I go then?

589
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,688
I'm back out on the street
'cause I have to be.

590
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,314
A lot of us are.

591
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,608
I have two options:

592
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,486
Either I roll with Dodger...

593
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,448
or hide from Dodger.

594
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,993
That's it.

595
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,583
I can't believe you held that guy off
on your own.

596
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,543
I mean, I can.

597
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,879
You know you're a total badass, right?

598
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,632
I like to think so.

599
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,594
And how did Pureheart hold up?

600
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:27,888
[groans]

601
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,725
Honestly?

602
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,562
I don't know what I'm doing.

603
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,816
I vowed to create a safe space
for the kids in this town,

604
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,569
something my dad could be proud of.

605
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,905
It's never gonna happen as long as guys
like Dodger are on the streets.

606
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,241
Okay, so then we clean up the streets.

607
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,254
Archie.

608
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,131
As well as you fill them out,

609
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,176
you're not actually considering
fighting crime in those tights, are you?

610
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:06,844
Of course not.

611
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,680
I'm gonna need a mask.

612
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,309
-[Toni] Cheryl?
-How was your shower, my love?

613
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,187
Why was this sitting on the bed?

614
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:21,192
I thought we agreed to put an end to this.
Jason's back. You got what you wanted.

615
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,906
Although it pains me to admit it...

616
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,077
yes, I was gaslighting you before.

617
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,245
And for that, I apologize.

618
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:39,001
But I swear on Jason's life, I have
no idea how that got back into this house.

619
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,128
Truly.

620
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,256
Well, then how is this happening?

621
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,219
I mean... we for sure buried this doll,
right?

622
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,471
[Rose] I told you.

623
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,557
It's Julian.

624
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,312
Tee-Tee.

625
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:03,401
I'm afraid the true haunting
of Thistlehouse has only just begun.

626
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,617
Moose, you are not going to believe
what Bret--

627
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,583
[Jughead] <i>I mean,</i>
<i>it's like Moose completely vanished.</i>

628
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,795
There's not a trace of him anywhere,
Betty.

629
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,381
Well, is it possible
he actually joined the Army?

630
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,424
I don't know.

631
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:32,096
I placed a couple calls, but I know
it was them that chased him out of here.

632
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,348
<i>I mean, did they lock me in that coffin</i>

633
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,518
because they wanted me out of the way
while they terrorized Moose into leaving?

634
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:42,857
I don't know.

635
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,609
I just hate that they kept me
from helping you.

636
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,528
<i>I'm sorry that you had</i>
<i>to go through that alone.</i>

637
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,156
Technically, I wasn't alone.

638
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,408
<i>I was with Charles.</i>

639
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:53,909
Oh.

640
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,121
So, are you warming up
to our half brother now?

641
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,081
I guess so.

642
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,001
[on headphones] <i>Yeah. Kind of.</i>

643
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:07,965
<i>He wants me to join the Junior FBI, which,</i>
<i>I don't know, I might actually be good at.</i>

644
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,217
[Jughead] <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>I think you would be great at it.</i>

645
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,512
<i>I'm just glad</i>
<i>that Charles was there for you.</i>

646
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:14,805
[Betty] <i>Yeah.</i>

647
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,476
<i>He might be the real deal.</i>

648
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,314
Meanwhile, I feel guilty
that I wasn't there for you, Jug.

649
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,358
No. Well, actually, you were there for me.

650
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,029
Thinking about you was the only thing
that kept me from losing hope.

651
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,572
<i>And my sanity.</i>

652
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,911
I think I know that if I ever went missing
that you would be the one to find me.

653
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,746
I would, Jug.

654
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,085
<i>I promise.</i>
