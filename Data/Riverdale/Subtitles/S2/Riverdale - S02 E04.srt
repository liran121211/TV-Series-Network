1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,484
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,726
He calls himself the Black Hood and
he wants us to publish this letter.

3
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:07,911
My wrath is the price of your lies.

4
00:00:07,914 --> 00:00:10,403
He sent it to the printer
for tomorrow's front page.

5
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:13,372
I'm gonna protect you. Nothing like
this is ever gonna happen to you again.

6
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,356
I swear it.

7
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,842
No!

8
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:18,118
- It's me.
- Are you freaking insane?

9
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:20,468
Sometimes, defending
yourself, it's not enough.

10
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:22,071
You need to go on the offensive.

11
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:25,125
We're called the Red Circle, and
we're coming for you. We will find you.

12
00:00:25,128 --> 00:00:27,570
We'll hunt you and we will end you.

13
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:35,794
Everyone's afraid to say it,

14
00:00:35,797 --> 00:00:37,530
so let me be the first.

15
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:40,366
There is a serial killer amongst us.

16
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:42,890
San Francisco had the Zodiac.

17
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:45,710
New Orleans had the Axeman.

18
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:49,914
Texarkana, Texas, had
the Phantom Killer.

19
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:53,195
The list goes on and on.

20
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,715
Add to their ranks Riverdale's
very own psychopath,

21
00:00:56,718 --> 00:00:58,451
the Black Hood.

22
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,895
Are these research for school?

23
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:08,234
Research... But not for school.

24
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,279
It's a terrible thing,
what's going on in this town.

25
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:15,558
Who would've thunk it?

26
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:17,403
A serial killer in Riverdale?

27
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,953
I'm not just talking about him.

28
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,796
I'm also talking about that
awful video those boys put out.

29
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,000
There it was. Terror was seeping
into the bedrock of Riverdale...

30
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:31,882
A Town Hall Meeting had
been set by Mayor McCoy.

31
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,637
_

32
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,796
People were afraid to
walk the streets alone,

33
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,693
especially as dusk approached.

34
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:46,710
Shops closed early,
locks were added to doors,

35
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:49,835
suspicions between the North
and South side deepened,

36
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:53,757
fanned into flames by Alice Cooper...

37
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:03,492
As everyone wondered what
danger lurked in the dark.

38
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:09,589
When would we hear from
the Black Hood next,

39
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:16,215
and how far into darkness

40
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:20,366
would Archie go on his
quest to avenge his father...

41
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:23,570
And to stop the Black Hood?

42
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:31,733
To be honest, I had no idea
what Archie was thinking...

43
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:33,812
He didn't say anything
to you about this video?

44
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:36,221
- Am I my boyfriend's keeper?
- Basta, mija,

45
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:37,958
this isn't something you
should be joking about.

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,362
- It's a video, Mom...
- Yes, threatening violence.

47
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:44,116
Daddy, can you please tell
Mom she's overreacting?

48
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,580
On this matter, Veronica,
I stand with your mother.

49
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,554
Which means you are done
dating Archie Andrews.

50
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:54,320
This isn't Amish country, Mom,
I can date who I want to date.

51
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:58,531
And I'm not jumping to any conclusions
until I hear Archie's side of the story.

52
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,375
What are you smiling about?

53
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:10,562
The Black Hood, the Red
Circle, a Town Hall meeting,

54
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,648
so much chaos and confusion.

55
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:18,115
How could you do this
to me, Elizabeth? To us?

56
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:20,497
Polly asked for my help, Mom.

57
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,734
To run away, and you agreed?

58
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:24,664
We know where she is.

59
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:28,434
And frankly, thank God she's out of
Riverdale and away from that psycho.

60
00:03:28,436 --> 00:03:30,539
And you think that that
guarantees her safety?

61
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:33,492
- Polly was scared.
- And you don't think that I am?

62
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:37,604
I'm terrified.

63
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:43,731
Every time that you walk out that door.

64
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:48,757
Every time that I call you, and
you don't pick up the phone...

65
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,892
My heart stops. But how am I
supposed to protect you two girls?

66
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:55,661
Right, when you go and do this.

67
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:58,131
And then you try to make me the monster.

68
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,141
There's only one of you, but

69
00:04:09,144 --> 00:04:12,446
we are legion. We're
called the Red Circle.

70
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:16,905
So, what did you think,
that I wouldn't see it?

71
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:21,963
Dad, I was pissed off.

72
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:24,368
We were all pretty pissed off.

73
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:26,914
We were trying to send a
message, scare the Black Hood.

74
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,727
It's more likely you'll
antagonize this maniac

75
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,797
and become a target yourself.

76
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,666
Take it down right now, while I can see.

77
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:38,368
I already did, the original
post, but people keep sharing it.

78
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:41,240
Good grief, Archie.

79
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:46,204
My mom's spiraling. Do you think
you can come over during lunch...

80
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,727
Betty, I have to try and at least maintain
a semblance of being a student here.

81
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,180
Crap.

82
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:55,664
Uh, I gotta go, Betty, okay.
Hey, I'll talk to you later.

83
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:10,618
Hey. I'm guessing we're not
watching funny cat videos.

84
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:14,373
Check this out.

85
00:05:15,877 --> 00:05:18,844
Some sick-in-the-head Northsider
posted a crazy-ass video,

86
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:21,180
- and we were just talking...
- About what?

87
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:23,500
Fogarty wants to earn
his Serpent stripes.

88
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:25,914
I say bring us the head of
that Northsider, and you're in.

89
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:27,019
I'm down with that.

90
00:05:27,922 --> 00:05:29,321
No, guys, don't.

91
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:31,204
What, Jones?

92
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:33,461
I know this guy, he's a milquetoast.

93
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:37,590
He's a football player. It's kind
of a lame target, is all I'm saying.

94
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,533
You wanna prove something?

95
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,688
Why don't you go after the Black Hood?

96
00:05:44,972 --> 00:05:46,371
And why would we do that?

97
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:48,289
The Black Hood's targeting Northsiders,

98
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:49,707
who do nothing but blame the Southside

99
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,302
for everything that's
wrong with this town.

100
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:54,535
And we're sick of it. The Black
Hood's doing our work for us.

101
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:56,048
He's a hero.

102
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:04,190
Black Hood. Black Hood.

103
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:07,526
We're called the Red Circle
and we're coming for you.

104
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:10,027
We will find you.

105
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,407
We will hunt you. We will end you.

106
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,577
Black Hood.

107
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,202
My parents want me to break up with you.

108
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:22,514
They basically think you're
the teen American Psycho.

109
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:24,336
Since when do you care about
what your parents think?

110
00:06:24,338 --> 00:06:27,116
I don't, except when I
happen to agree with them.

111
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,981
Can't you just support
me on this, Ronnie?

112
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:30,350
On what?

113
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:34,352
Is this part of some master plan?
'Cause if it is, please enlighten me.

114
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:35,913
You know, to be honest,

115
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,327
I don't see why your dad's got
such a problem with it, Veronica.

116
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:41,422
He pretty much gave me the idea. In his
study, he basically told me I should...

117
00:06:41,424 --> 00:06:45,137
Line up a bunch of semi-naked boys
straight out of Lord of the Flies

118
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,388
put them in red ski masks

119
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:48,690
and deliver some
Unabomber-like manifesto?

120
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:50,421
Is that what he said you should do?

121
00:06:50,424 --> 00:06:52,337
Fight fire with fire.

122
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,873
Fight terror with terror.

123
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:57,559
That's what he said.

124
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,537
Mr. Archie Andrews, please
report to the principal's office.

125
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,561
"We will find you. We will hunt you.

126
00:07:07,564 --> 00:07:09,342
And we will end you."

127
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:12,513
These are your sentiments, Mr. Andrews.

128
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,943
And they are hardly comforting.

129
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:15,709
Principal Weatherbee, you have my word,

130
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:18,017
there's only one person who
should be scared by that video.

131
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:20,365
You're off the football
team, Mr. Andrews,

132
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:22,233
effective immediately.

133
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:24,069
In fact, there is no football team.

134
00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:27,406
Not until this Red
Circle insanity is over.

135
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:31,905
If, by week's end, you
haven't written a signed letter

136
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:35,225
apologizing to the entire
Riverdale High community

137
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:38,522
and disbanding the Red Circle,
your suspension will begin,

138
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,619
and will continue until you've complied.

139
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:43,584
Care to re-think your position?

140
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:52,077
It's a crazy time, sir.

141
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,207
We all have to do
what we think is right.

142
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:10,248
Betty, okay.

143
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:13,268
So, telling my dad about me
cruising the woods? Not cool.

144
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:15,004
He even told my mom about it.

145
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:20,584
Also, I've re-upped my online
membership to redstatemeat.com,

146
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:23,178
so there'll be no cruising
for the foreseeable.

147
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:28,193
Betty? What? What is it?

148
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,959
I was going through the
Blue and Gold's mail...

149
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,311
And I got a letter from
the Black Hood killer...

150
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:46,494
He says he's doing it for me.

151
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,483
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

152
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:01,546
"Betty, your words at
the Jubilee inspired me.

153
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:04,381
The town's sinners must
show their contrition.

154
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:06,999
If not, there will be more
suffering and bloodshed.

155
00:09:07,002 --> 00:09:10,761
Enclosed is a cipher. It details
where I will punish the next sinner.

156
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:14,059
It is a test. Only you
may solve it, Betty."

157
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:21,288
My speech... Inspired him.

158
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,343
That stupid speech I wrote.

159
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,569
So the Black Hood was at the Jubilee.

160
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:27,305
The entire town was there.

161
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:29,007
We have to give this to my dad.

162
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:31,874
The cipher, yeah, sure,
but not the letter,

163
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:33,478
This is just...

164
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,134
For me. We can't tell anyone about it.

165
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:37,169
It's evidence.

166
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:39,116
Kevin, if we give this
letter to your dad,

167
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:42,187
he will tell my mom, and she will
make damn sure I'm nowhere near this.

168
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:43,822
- Good.
- No.

169
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:47,559
This is a test.

170
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:51,069
He said so himself. What if...

171
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:54,647
The start of the test
is to see what I do

172
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,662
with the letter? Do I share it? Or not?

173
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,364
Am I strong?

174
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:02,139
Or am I weak? Am I... Worthy?

175
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:06,600
He's a psychopath, Betty, and you
are in high school, not the FBI.

176
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:10,138
Isn't it better for people to be focusing
on the cipher, rather than the letter?

177
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,574
How would that even happen?

178
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:19,608
Mom, I'm so scared.

179
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:22,226
I didn't know what to do or who to call.

180
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:26,139
Oh, baby, please tell me what's
going on so I can make it better.

181
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:28,866
I got this envelope
at the Blue and Gold.

182
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,635
Not another letter from the Black Hood.

183
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:32,637
No, not a letter.

184
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:39,986
Was there anything else
in the envelope? A note?

185
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:41,567
Not according to Betty.

186
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,725
Why a code this time,
and not another letter?

187
00:10:45,598 --> 00:10:47,638
And why did he send it to
your daughter and not you?

188
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,754
Well, it's obvious, Sheriff.

189
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:51,788
He needs a platform to grandstand on,

190
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,224
and he's terrified of me.

191
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:58,468
Well, there's a cryptologist over in
Centerville. I'll get it over to him.

192
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:01,633
- In the meantime...
- I've already published it, Sheriff.

193
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:04,402
The entire town should be
trying to crack this code.

194
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:05,770
Don't you think?

195
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,261
Damn it, Andrews.

196
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:12,733
I told you we shouldn't
have made that video.

197
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:15,022
And now Weatherbee's suspended the team?

198
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,525
What if he comes after us next?

199
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:19,384
That's why you're wearing hoods,
Reggie, so that all the heat falls on me.

200
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:20,998
But it's not.

201
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,388
It's falling on all of us.

202
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:28,665
So please, bro, sign the letter.

203
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:32,063
No.

204
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,261
We disband the circle now, what
message does that show the Black Hood?

205
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:38,321
That we're weak, helpless.

206
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,821
No, we wanna force his hand.

207
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:42,407
By doing what exactly?

208
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,751
By going to his home
turf, the Southside.

209
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:47,053
What? Are you insane?

210
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,489
No, I've gone over this.

211
00:11:48,492 --> 00:11:52,469
Mrs. Cooper is convinced the Black Hood
is a Southsider with an axe to grind,

212
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:55,071
which makes sense when you think
about the people he's attacked

213
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:57,547
My dad. A Northsider.

214
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,957
Moose and Midge both Northside kids.

215
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,328
- Grundy was in Greendale.
- Yeah, But before that, she taught here, Doiley.

216
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,203
Everyone has seen our video
and is riled up as hell, right?

217
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,110
We can only assume
the Black Hood is, too.

218
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:11,768
If there's even a chance that
he's a Southsider, us going there

219
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:15,306
into his territory, making our
presence known, could draw him out.

220
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:17,469
And the hunters become the hunted.

221
00:12:17,472 --> 00:12:19,328
That's one way to find him.

222
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:21,500
Nope, I'm done.

223
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,757
We're done. Come on, guys

224
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,186
And then there was one.

225
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:40,429
Which is what you wanted, right?

226
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:42,266
You and the Black Hood,

227
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:46,149
mano a mano, to the death.

228
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:48,673
What the hell are you
talking about, Doiley?

229
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:51,547
I know you have a certain
item in your possession.

230
00:12:53,537 --> 00:12:56,638
The Red Circle was just your
way to draw the Black Hood out.

231
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:59,751
And now you wanna go into his territory.

232
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:01,252
Maybe. Yeah.

233
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,286
You're gonna need a few things.

234
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:07,094
There's a place, on the
edge of town, they can help.

235
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:08,793
Go after dark.

236
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,008
Daddy?

237
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:23,805
When Archie came into this room...

238
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:25,040
Yeah.

239
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:27,278
What did you guys talk about?

240
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:30,513
Don't remember, to be
honest. Why do you ask?

241
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:35,787
I was just thinking. You know, one
of the things I love about Archie is

242
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:37,121
how earnest he is.

243
00:13:37,124 --> 00:13:40,372
Not in a bad way, more in
an innocent sort of way.

244
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,005
Trusting. Kind.

245
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:45,797
Of course, that simplicity
also makes him...

246
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,098
Impressionable.

247
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:50,508
Vulnerable to certain forms of attack.

248
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:52,203
What are you going on about?

249
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,005
Manipulation.

250
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:59,505
If someone were to, say, pour poison

251
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:02,294
into one of his cute-as-a-button ears...

252
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:06,656
Some dark notion might
take shape in his mind.

253
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:09,126
Say... The Red Circle.

254
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:12,513
- If you're suggesting...
- I'm not suggesting anything, Daddy.

255
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:16,031
I'm asking, what did you
and my boyfriend talk about?

256
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:19,138
And I've already told
you I don't remember.

257
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:23,321
Now, if you'll excuse me, the
Swiss banks are about to close,

258
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:26,055
and I have a call with
the Lodge Charitable Trust.

259
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:27,390
Trust.

260
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:30,796
Right. Got it.

261
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:35,620
Have a nice call, Daddy.

262
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:48,154
So... What are you reading?

263
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:53,891
Beware the Zodiac.

264
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:57,071
It's decent, though I prefer
Robert Graysmith's definitive books

265
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:59,008
on the subject.

266
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:02,978
Are you gonna get that?

267
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:06,611
I can call her back later.

268
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:12,430
Jones, Jones, Jones. You disappoint me.

269
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:16,063
If serial killers are your
jam, might I suggest Ted Bundy,

270
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:18,852
Albert Fish, Aileen Wuornos.

271
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:20,942
They don't fit the profile.

272
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:24,063
Right. Unlike most serial
killers, our guy wears a mask.

273
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:25,828
Well, a hood, when he kills.

274
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:27,664
Suggests someone consumed
with self-loathing.

275
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:31,563
Conversely, he sends letters
and cryptos to the press.

276
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:35,352
Do you think he's narcissistic
or a Batman villain?

277
00:15:37,162 --> 00:15:39,195
I'm a true crime junkie.

278
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,258
True crime is my crack.

279
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:45,375
I figured. And that's
why I'm seeking you out.

280
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,110
The Register took a break
from bashing the Southside

281
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,433
to post the Black Hood's cipher.

282
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:52,089
You wanna help me crack it?

283
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:58,581
Sure.

284
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:18,144
_

285
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,597
Hey, I was just on my way out.

286
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:39,700
What's up?

287
00:16:43,476 --> 00:16:44,784
- Okay.
- There.

288
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:47,144
That's my way of apologizing to you

289
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:49,379
for raining on your Red
Circle parade earlier today.

290
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:52,083
I wanna support you
and your comely crew,

291
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:53,839
even at the risk of enraging my parents.

292
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:56,198
Especially my father. Which
is just what he deserves

293
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:58,237
after playing mind games with you.

294
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,550
Ronnie, I really gotta go,

295
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,888
and anyway, it's too late. The
Red Circle fell apart this morning.

296
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,815
Wait, what? It's over? Already?

297
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:05,183
For the other guys, yeah,

298
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:07,637
but it's fine. This is my battle.
No one else needs to fight it.

299
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:10,659
No, no, no. If it's
yours, then it's mine, too.

300
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,644
And it can't just be you
against an armed madman.

301
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:17,237
No, Riverdale needs the Red
Circle to expand, not contract.

302
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,175
- Yeah. But the guys...
- Are spineless cowards, clearly.

303
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,551
Lucky for you, I'm not.

304
00:17:40,378 --> 00:17:44,435
Hi. I'm hoping to get a
few things. I have a list.

305
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:50,389
You got ID?

306
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:52,143
Yeah.

307
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:02,753
I'll be paying cash
for those items, too.

308
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:05,377
Just be a sec.

309
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,509
Ammo, holster, Kevlar vest.

310
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:17,435
You, uh... You going hunting?

311
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:21,597
Yeah, yes. That's
exactly what I'm doing.

312
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,851
Betty? What time is it?

313
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:31,901
7:15. I wanted to
catch you before school.

314
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:34,132
I'm sorry. I have morning breath.

315
00:18:34,135 --> 00:18:36,130
You want coffee or something?

316
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:39,341
No, I'm actually on
my way to the library.

317
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:41,867
I asked Ms. Paroo to set aside all the

318
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,779
books she has about
cryptograms and ciphers.

319
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:47,182
I thought it might help us
crack the Black Hood's code.

320
00:18:47,184 --> 00:18:50,019
Which I'm hoping is something
we can do together, Chuck.

321
00:18:54,191 --> 00:18:55,224
Um...

322
00:18:55,227 --> 00:19:01,697
Actually, funny enough,
Toni of all people and I,

323
00:19:01,699 --> 00:19:05,167
we started working on that
yesterday at the Red and Black.

324
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,865
I can show you what we've
got so far, if you want.

325
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,175
Toni, because let me guess...

326
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,878
She loves serial killers.

327
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:19,943
She does have an affinity for
the darker side of things, yeah.

328
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,321
In that case, why don't
we all work on it together?

329
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:28,755
You, me, Toni, Kevin.

330
00:19:28,758 --> 00:19:31,357
- Kevin?
- Yeah, it'll be like a little

331
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,397
code-breaking party.
So fun! You can host.

332
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:43,038
There you are.

333
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,808
I have a surprise for you.

334
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,701
It meant burning the midnight
oil and calling in a few favors,

335
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:52,365
- but... Ta-da.
- Ronnie, you can't wear that.

336
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:54,361
Are you saying I'm not
rocking this scoop-neck look?

337
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:57,030
No, I'm saying you can't walk around
with a friggi" target on your chest.

338
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:58,721
You'll stick out like a sore thumb.

339
00:19:58,723 --> 00:20:02,224
Oh, Archie, it's adorable
when you underestimate me.

340
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:03,859
Come, come.

341
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,564
Oh, my God.

342
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,802
Let Weatherbee do his worst.

343
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:14,670
The Red Circle is no longer
a fringe band of radicals,

344
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,539
it's a movement with style and panache.

345
00:20:33,228 --> 00:20:36,451
These symbols look so familiar to me.

346
00:20:36,454 --> 00:20:38,160
It's like I've seen them before

347
00:20:38,162 --> 00:20:40,162
and it's driving me crazy
I can't figure out where.

348
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:42,131
Maybe if you loosened your ponytail.

349
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:47,571
What? That was a joke, guys.

350
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:50,498
Betty's ponytail is
iconic and beyond reproach.

351
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,167
Kev... It's fine.

352
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,417
And at this point, I'm
willing to try anything.

353
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:00,581
Per Mrs. Paroo's books,

354
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:03,685
I'm looking for common
letter associations like

355
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:06,052
T-H, A-N, I-N-G.

356
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:09,294
I'm looking for doubles. Double
L and four-letter words like kill.

357
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:11,998
- That's morbid.
- We don't know if this thing's even in English.

358
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:13,521
Guys, I mean, this could be an angram.

359
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,326
I'm literally on the top of my brain...

360
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:17,518
All right. Let's go back to the basics.

361
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:19,584
What do we know about
this guy? Who is he?

362
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:22,223
He's a white male, in his 40s.

363
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:24,177
Like almost every serial killer ever.

364
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,849
No, I mean like why...
Why is he killing people?

365
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:29,576
Or at least, why now?

366
00:21:31,027 --> 00:21:33,712
We know the Hood's
obsessed with cleansing

367
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:36,397
the town of sinners
and hypocrites, right?

368
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,764
And he seems to be attacking
anyone with ties to the Northside.

369
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,115
Here we go with the fake news again.

370
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,850
You Northsiders and your privilege.

371
00:21:45,853 --> 00:21:47,311
All you do is demonize the Southside

372
00:21:47,314 --> 00:21:49,475
so of course you think the
Black Hood's from there.

373
00:21:49,478 --> 00:21:53,123
It's not demonizing,
Toni. It's stating facts.

374
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:55,475
There's way more drugs and gangs and...

375
00:21:55,478 --> 00:21:59,639
The drugs you mean which were sold
primarily to Northside crackheads?

376
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:01,394
And what about the Northside Neo-Nazis?

377
00:22:01,397 --> 00:22:04,670
The Red Circle? The
Red Psychos, you mean.

378
00:22:04,673 --> 00:22:07,049
Hell, Betty, I'm surprised you
haven't just come out and said it yet.

379
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:07,733
Said what?

380
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:10,326
That you think the
Black Hood's a Serpent.

381
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,988
We all know how much you hate us.

382
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:15,248
- Okay, Toni...
- I don't hate the Serpents.

383
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,003
Oh, yeah? Then why is it
that your boyfriend here

384
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:18,965
lies about the fact that
he sits with us at lunch?

385
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:24,844
I'm gonna go.

386
00:22:25,404 --> 00:22:28,229
Yeah, you know what? I'm
gonna get outta here, too.

387
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:30,031
Okay. I can walk you home.

388
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,042
Or you can walk me home.

389
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:36,478
Um, bye, guys.

390
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:42,873
Listen, Betty, I sit with the Serpents
purely for reasons of survival.

391
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:44,919
It's okay, Jug, let's just keep working

392
00:22:44,922 --> 00:22:47,064
on the cipher, okay?
The clock's ticking.

393
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,334
What clock? I mean, this
could be his laundry list.

394
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:50,836
Or his kill list.

395
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:58,293
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

396
00:23:58,296 --> 00:24:00,486
- Back off. I'm not herefor you.
- Oh, yeah...

397
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:02,351
Then who's this message for, huh?

398
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:06,369
Aw, hell, don't tell me
it's for the Black Hood.

399
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:08,303
You believe this guy?

400
00:24:08,306 --> 00:24:10,766
And people say we're the troublemakers.

401
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:13,144
Whoa.

402
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:16,549
Southside's Serpent country.

403
00:24:16,552 --> 00:24:19,728
You can't come here and tag our turf.

404
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:22,283
So why don't you get your
ass back to the Northside

405
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:23,685
before someone gets hurt?

406
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:25,343
Get out of my way,

407
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:27,055
or someone will get hurt.

408
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:29,625
You just made a big mistake.

409
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,471
- Who made a mistake? Who made a mistake?
- What the hell?

410
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,007
Come on, let's go. Come on, man!

411
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:11,939
- Ow, my neck.
- We fell asleep.

412
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:13,841
How did we fall asleep?

413
00:25:13,844 --> 00:25:17,144
Exhaustion. It's not easy being us.

414
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:21,939
Oh, my God, she's gonna
kill me. I have to go.

415
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:23,175
What?

416
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:26,541
My mom, she's gonna kill
me. I have to go, okay.

417
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:28,416
I'll call you later.

418
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:34,911
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Phylum,

419
00:25:35,588 --> 00:25:39,018
but Sheriff Keller and I need to
see Archie Andrews in the hallway.

420
00:25:42,938 --> 00:25:46,607
I'm sorry Principal Weatherbee but the
T-shirts were my idea, not Archie's.

421
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:49,610
This is not about T-shirts,
Miss Lodge, please sit down.

422
00:25:49,612 --> 00:25:51,678
It's okay, Ronnie. There's
nothing to worry about.

423
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,921
Got a tip from a bodega
owner on the Southside

424
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:02,656
who said that a Riverdale
High School student

425
00:26:02,658 --> 00:26:04,736
was waving a gun around
in front of his shop.

426
00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:06,567
Said it looked like he had red hair.

427
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,062
I was in my garage last
night, working on some songs.

428
00:26:09,072 --> 00:26:12,668
Okay, well, nevertheless, given your
behavior over the last several days,

429
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:14,301
we think that it's
prudent to have a look

430
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:16,176
in your locker for any
weapons or contraband.

431
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:18,214
Weapons? Don't you need a
warrant for that or something?

432
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:20,502
- No, I do not.
- Maybe we should call my dad.

433
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:23,644
I did. He's informed.
Open the locker or I will.

434
00:26:27,983 --> 00:26:30,484
I don't know what you think
you're gonna find, Sheriff.

435
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:43,697
This is interesting.

436
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:45,499
What? There's no gun.

437
00:26:48,304 --> 00:26:49,903
Where did you get this hood?

438
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:52,372
I can explain that.

439
00:26:57,955 --> 00:27:00,341
The hood's not mine, it's Reggie's.

440
00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:03,464
He came by as a joke, wearing
it, trying to scare me, Dad.

441
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:05,458
I don't know what to say.

442
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:07,771
I'm at a loss, Archie.

443
00:27:07,774 --> 00:27:09,909
Keller and Weatherbee,
they think you're a

444
00:27:09,912 --> 00:27:12,192
threat, so they bar you
from school property,

445
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:13,634
and I can't tell them any different.

446
00:27:16,131 --> 00:27:17,564
I was shot.

447
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:20,801
The man who shot me is still out there,

448
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:23,586
playing some kind of weird
cat-and-mouse game with this town.

449
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:24,771
And he scares me.

450
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:28,742
But not as much as you do right now.

451
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:32,279
Because I have no idea what
is going on in your mind.

452
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:34,742
I don't know what you're gonna do next.

453
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:36,633
Wait, Dad, come on.
Can we talk about this?

454
00:27:36,636 --> 00:27:39,320
Yeah, when I get back from the
Town Hall we can talk about this.

455
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,336
If you're ready to be honest with me,

456
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:43,090
and let me back in.

457
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,899
Nice T-shirt.

458
00:27:53,995 --> 00:27:56,033
Will you still be wearing
it when Archie's arrested

459
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:58,177
for reckless endangerment
or something worse?

460
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,140
Archie would never, Mom.
He's being railroaded.

461
00:28:01,143 --> 00:28:02,509
And you can say that,

462
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:06,690
with absolute certainty,
after watching that video?

463
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:10,917
Maybe you can.

464
00:28:11,854 --> 00:28:13,754
Or maybe you're just being loyal.

465
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:17,721
But let me tell you
something about loyalty.

466
00:28:19,294 --> 00:28:21,828
There's nothing more honorable than it.

467
00:28:22,531 --> 00:28:23,979
Noble, even.

468
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:26,667
But blind loyalty?

469
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:31,938
That's a stupid and dangerous thing.

470
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:36,743
I pray that's not the
case with you and Archie.

471
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:44,263
When you left this morning,
you forgot some of your books.

472
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,655
Your notebooks.

473
00:28:45,658 --> 00:28:48,548
Look, I wasn't snooping,
believe it or not, but...

474
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:50,323
It just fell out.

475
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:53,126
What did?

476
00:28:54,396 --> 00:28:56,634
Your letter, from the Black Hood.

477
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:57,597
Jug.

478
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,466
I'm assuming that it
came with the cipher.

479
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:01,699
Betty, why haven't you told anybody?

480
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:03,558
I, I did, I told Kevin.

481
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:04,638
Why didn't you tell me?

482
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,139
Because you've been

483
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,128
at Southside High, running
around with the Serpents.

484
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:11,183
Betty, I'd been gone for two days.

485
00:29:11,186 --> 00:29:13,613
And yeah, it sucks that we don't
go to the same school anymore.

486
00:29:13,615 --> 00:29:15,293
But that's not the reason you're sitting

487
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:17,973
on the fact that the Black
Hood has sent you a letter.

488
00:29:17,976 --> 00:29:21,020
- So why is it...
- Because of what it says, Jughead!

489
00:29:21,023 --> 00:29:23,123
Because of what he wrote.

490
00:29:25,227 --> 00:29:26,860
That I...

491
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:29,029
Inspired him.

492
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:32,245
I inspired all of this... Madness.

493
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:34,115
You think people are
gonna blame you for this?

494
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:40,907
Not people, just one person.

495
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,209
Archie?

496
00:29:45,414 --> 00:29:46,646
For what?

497
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:48,815
For writing a speech that this lunatic

498
00:29:48,818 --> 00:29:51,149
has twisted around in
order to mess with you

499
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:52,752
and mess with the town?

500
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:56,296
Yeah, Archie's definitely shook,
but he knows who the bad guys are,

501
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:58,366
and you're not one of the bad guys.

502
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:01,428
You're Betty Cooper.

503
00:30:01,431 --> 00:30:04,524
Like Nancy Drew meets Girl
with the Dragon Tattoo.

504
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:08,816
- Oh, my God.
- What?

505
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:11,015
In his letter, the Black Hood said that

506
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,430
I'm the only one who
could solve the cipher

507
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:16,309
like he created it specifically for me.

508
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:18,772
Maybe using one of my touchstones, Jug.

509
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:23,365
If I'm right, I think I
know how to decode this.

510
00:30:24,712 --> 00:30:25,978
Let's go.

511
00:30:29,223 --> 00:30:32,224
Archie? What the hell is going on?

512
00:30:32,227 --> 00:30:33,560
Are you okay?

513
00:30:33,562 --> 00:30:35,602
I need you to get
something for me, Ronnie.

514
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:08,782
At least you were smart enough
not to keep it in your locker,

515
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,384
but a gun, Archie?

516
00:31:10,387 --> 00:31:11,831
Why? For what?

517
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,066
To protect myself.

518
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:14,555
Against the Black Hood?

519
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:19,345
Archie, that video,

520
00:31:19,348 --> 00:31:21,444
the gun... If I'm following you,

521
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:23,799
I need to know where, I
need to know the truth.

522
00:31:23,802 --> 00:31:25,846
I want him dead, Veronica.

523
00:31:27,613 --> 00:31:29,980
I want the Black Hood dead,

524
00:31:31,343 --> 00:31:33,143
and I want to be the one who does it.

525
00:31:34,386 --> 00:31:37,921
I want to be the last
thing that he sees.

526
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:40,769
Spoken like a true vigilante.

527
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:42,042
No, you wanted the truth.

528
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:44,297
I made that video and showed
my face so the Black Hood

529
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:45,808
would make me his next target.

530
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:47,964
I went to the Southside
hoping he would come after me.

531
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:52,053
So you find the Black Hood and
you shoot him and then what?

532
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:55,475
You go to jail or you miss
him, and he kills you, Archie.

533
00:31:55,477 --> 00:31:58,378
- It doesn't matter what happens to me.
- Yes, it does. It matters to me,

534
00:31:58,381 --> 00:32:00,280
and your dad, Betty, Jughead.

535
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:06,386
Meanwhile, like an idiot,

536
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:08,622
I'm trying to support
you by designing T-shirts.

537
00:32:08,624 --> 00:32:09,756
I didn't ask you to do that.

538
00:32:09,758 --> 00:32:12,125
No, you just asked me
to fetch your loaded gun.

539
00:32:12,128 --> 00:32:14,661
And by the way, in case
you're wondering where it is,

540
00:32:14,663 --> 00:32:16,417
I threw it in Sweetwater River.

541
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,608
What?

542
00:32:17,611 --> 00:32:20,490
And you can be mad at me now,
but you'll thank me for it later.

543
00:32:23,272 --> 00:32:25,372
Wait. Veronica, wait, what if it's...

544
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:28,794
Reggie?

545
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:30,677
Can we come in?

546
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,487
Parents of Riverdale,

547
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,822
I've heard your concerns.

548
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:45,158
I share them.

549
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:49,698
As your Mayor, my top priorities
are ensuring the safety of our town,

550
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,784
and our children.

551
00:32:51,787 --> 00:32:54,982
The purpose of this Town Hall
is to answer your questions.

552
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:57,470
And, if I can, to ease your minds.

553
00:32:58,682 --> 00:33:00,975
To what do we owe this unexpected honor?

554
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:03,476
Archie could have told
Weatherbee the hood was mine,

555
00:33:03,478 --> 00:33:05,078
but he didn't.

556
00:33:05,081 --> 00:33:09,115
In the Book of Reg, that makes
you a top-tier loyal badass.

557
00:33:09,118 --> 00:33:12,118
And, uh. We were
talkin' today and decided

558
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:14,588
if you wanna keep the
Red Circle going...

559
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:16,190
We're here for you, dude.

560
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:28,772
And not a moment too
soon. Archie. Trouble.

561
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:42,227
How stupid are you Northsiders?

562
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:46,529
You really think you can come to
my house, stick a gun in my face

563
00:33:46,532 --> 00:33:47,931
in front of my boys,

564
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:49,561
and there wouldn't be any payback?

565
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,730
You have crap timing, bro.

566
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,907
Bulldogs eat Serpents for lunch.

567
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,076
We'll see about that.

568
00:34:00,846 --> 00:34:02,679
And the more, the merrier.

569
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:03,947
Hey, chill.

570
00:34:03,949 --> 00:34:05,281
Veronica, stay here.

571
00:34:05,284 --> 00:34:07,053
What? Archie, no...

572
00:34:07,056 --> 00:34:08,755
Veronica, after my dad,

573
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:11,394
I made a promise to
protect him and this house.

574
00:34:12,924 --> 00:34:14,624
You stay here.

575
00:34:16,147 --> 00:34:17,981
If you wanna fight, we'll fight.

576
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,929
- What about your gun?
- What about your knife?

577
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:21,873
How about no weapons?

578
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:24,701
If you troglodytes insist on doing this,

579
00:34:24,703 --> 00:34:26,480
there are gonna be rules.

580
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:29,072
Or should I call Sheriff
Keller to be referee?

581
00:34:30,709 --> 00:34:34,256
When I was a kid, I used to
check out this book obsessively.

582
00:34:37,987 --> 00:34:39,286
Betty...

583
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:46,423
The budget is tight, we're
uh... Putting together a helpline

584
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:48,525
that you can call to report
any suspicious activity.

585
00:34:48,527 --> 00:34:53,022
Sounds an awful lot like the
Red Circle's hotline to me.

586
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:55,597
Did you have a question, Alice?

587
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,873
I'm wondering when you're gonna actually

588
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:00,136
address the real problem in Riverdale,

589
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,738
the Southside.

590
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:08,373
All in due time, Alice.

591
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:10,634
But we're here to talk
about the Black Hood.

592
00:35:10,637 --> 00:35:13,146
Now Sheriff Keller has a
plan he's putting in place,

593
00:35:13,149 --> 00:35:14,850
beginning with a town-wide curfew...

594
00:35:14,853 --> 00:35:16,241
Curfew?

595
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:19,498
We need to show strength, not cower.

596
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:21,457
Let's start by closing down

597
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,112
that drug-ridden Southside High,

598
00:35:24,115 --> 00:35:27,534
and use that money to
bolster our police department.

599
00:35:27,537 --> 00:35:31,896
Hire more deputies, who can
actually protect our children.

600
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,748
Just a sec.

601
00:35:40,946 --> 00:35:42,479
Oh, my God.

602
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:46,082
"I will strike next where it all began."

603
00:35:49,154 --> 00:35:51,121
Your speech... The Town Hall.

604
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:52,756
- My mom.
- Come on.

605
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:57,662
That neighborhood is a blight of
empty storefronts and vacant lots.

606
00:35:57,665 --> 00:36:01,506
A pit of violence, waiting to erupt.

607
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:05,502
Just ask Fred Andrews, himself a victim

608
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:09,914
of a vicious, insane
Southsider's bloodlust.

609
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:15,679
You talk about this town being divided.

610
00:36:15,682 --> 00:36:17,615
Alice, you're the one
holding the cleaver.

611
00:36:17,618 --> 00:36:20,403
The Southside is not the issue.

612
00:36:20,406 --> 00:36:23,528
The issue is there is a guy
out there with a gun and a hood.

613
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:25,798
And he's bringing out
the worst in this town.

614
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:27,348
Pitting it against itself.

615
00:36:38,837 --> 00:36:43,052
Of course, Fred Andrews turns
the other cheek, as usual.

616
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:45,891
I can't say much about your son Archie,

617
00:36:45,894 --> 00:36:48,688
but at least he's out
there, throwing elbows.

618
00:36:55,233 --> 00:36:59,030
We have to be united
in this fight, okay?

619
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:01,066
If we let the fear take over,

620
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:03,526
start demonizing each other,

621
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:05,795
that's when we're dead.

622
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:10,200
I told you Fred was gonna be a problem.

623
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:11,801
Oh, no...

624
00:37:11,804 --> 00:37:13,837
The town loves and trusts him.

625
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:16,105
That could work in our favor.

626
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:20,376
Everyone needs to leave, right now.

627
00:37:20,378 --> 00:37:21,678
The Black Hood is coming here.

628
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,479
He said this is his next target.

629
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:24,585
What are you talking about? What do

630
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:25,779
you mean the Black Hood's coming here?

631
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:27,617
The cipher says he's
coming to the Town Hall.

632
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:28,685
What?

633
00:37:30,188 --> 00:37:33,823
Everyone, stay calm and in
your seats. We'll sort this out.

634
00:37:50,308 --> 00:37:51,725
Dilton!

635
00:38:18,003 --> 00:38:20,777
Okay, you guys, let's
go! Let's get out of here.

636
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,112
Help me!

637
00:38:31,783 --> 00:38:33,616
When they ask you at the hospital...

638
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:36,486
Say I was minding my own business
when a bunch of Southside Serpents

639
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:37,987
jumped me for no reason.

640
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:42,592
Well, Elizabeth, we're waiting.

641
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:47,319
This is from the Black Hood.

642
00:38:47,322 --> 00:38:49,365
It came with the cipher.

643
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,669
And you've been keeping this from us?

644
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:05,290
Ah!

645
00:39:05,293 --> 00:39:06,793
Sorry.

646
00:39:06,796 --> 00:39:09,686
No. I deserve it.

647
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:12,388
Tonight was really messed up, Ronnie.

648
00:39:15,427 --> 00:39:17,026
Things got so out of control.

649
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,463
At least Dilton's going to be okay.

650
00:39:21,038 --> 00:39:22,538
Yeah, but only because of you.

651
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:24,838
You saved him, Ronnie.

652
00:39:26,549 --> 00:39:28,015
And me.

653
00:39:30,775 --> 00:39:33,276
These are fraught times, Archie.

654
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,938
No one's thinking straight.

655
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:41,276
We have to... Hold on to each other.

656
00:39:44,022 --> 00:39:45,054
Right?

657
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:49,225
I'm sorry I lied about
getting rid of the gun.

658
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:50,751
I was freaking out.

659
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:53,196
God, Ronnie, if I'd had it tonight...

660
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:58,134
I don't wanna think about
it, honestly, I might've...

661
00:39:59,204 --> 00:40:00,737
But you didn't.

662
00:40:02,646 --> 00:40:04,479
And...

663
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:08,348
I don't believe you would've.

664
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:12,133
Even if you'd had it.

665
00:40:17,622 --> 00:40:19,088
You're not a killer.

666
00:40:42,914 --> 00:40:44,080
Mmm.

667
00:40:44,883 --> 00:40:46,516
- Wait?
- What?

668
00:40:50,187 --> 00:40:52,655
We have one more thing
we need to do tonight.

669
00:40:56,127 --> 00:40:59,962
And so the young lovers went
back to where it all began,

670
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:02,342
Sweetwater River,

671
00:41:02,345 --> 00:41:05,902
to try and end the cycle of violence.

672
00:41:08,206 --> 00:41:10,173
We'd come to think of that night,

673
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,674
the night of the rumble,

674
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:13,775
the night of the Town Hall,

675
00:41:13,778 --> 00:41:15,498
as a turning point.

676
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:19,682
Riverdale would no longer
be the town with pep.

677
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:25,025
From now on, it would be known
as the town that dreaded sundown.

678
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,603
- Hello?
- Hello, Betty.

679
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
This is the Black Hood speaking.

680
