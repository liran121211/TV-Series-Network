00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,426
[narrator] Previously on Riverdale:

2
00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:04,888
Archie Andrews.
I'm Special Agent Adams with the FBI.

3
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:07,766
We believe Hiram Lodge is conducting
criminal activity.

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:10,393
You are at a unique position
to help us take him down.

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:13,396
I need assurance from you.
No matter what happens to Mr. Lodge

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,899
- my dad is gonna be okay.
- I can protect your father.

7
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,360
Effective immediately,
Southside High School is shut down.

8
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:22,280
- Well, it's done.
- After a few weeks, we'll quietly go about

9
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:24,741
purchasing the land
beneath Southside High.

10
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,286
And you will get your sizable donation
to your reelection campaign.

11
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:29,871
And, Daddy, this is...

12
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:33,124
Archie Andrews. The boy
who's captured my daughter's heart.

13
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,002
- I hope we can respect each other.
- Of course, Mr. Lodge.

14
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,796
No more sneaking
into my daughter's bedroom.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,298
Ever.

16
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:43,885
You wanted me to get a job, and I did.
Providing comfort and companionship

17
00:00:44,427 --> 00:00:46,304
to the lonely men of Riverdale.

18
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:48,973
You remember that baby
my mom put up for adoption?

19
00:00:49,057 --> 00:00:51,684
- Hey, let go of my brother!
- [screams]

20
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:52,769
You'll be safe here.

21
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:02,612
[Jughead] One week after Riverdale High's
absorption of its Southside counterpart,

22
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,405
and everything was the same.

23
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,327
And nothing was the same.

24
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:11,579
Take Archie Andrews.

25
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:14,332
On the surface,
he's getting ready for basketball tryouts,

26
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:15,917
as he does every winter.

27
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,753
But underneath, he was churning.

28
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:23,258
His life in chaos
after an unexpected visit from the feds.

29
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:27,220
Meanwhile, the town was preparing
to honor its founding father,

30
00:01:27,303 --> 00:01:29,472
General Augustus Pickens.

31
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:32,183
Mr. Jones. Eyes up front.

32
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,435
Thank you, Mrs. Haggly.

33
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:38,022
[sighs] As I was saying,

34
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,192
each year,
we honor the memory of General Pickens.

35
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:43,778
Yet few know the truth.

36
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,032
That it was
my great-great-great-grandpappy,

37
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:49,492
Colonel Barnabas B. Blossom,

38
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,744
who bankrolled
General Pickens' settlement of...

39
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:54,664
an Eden along the river of Sweetwater,

40
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:57,542
where maple trees grow taller
than the steeples

41
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,753
of Europe's grandest cathedrals,
which is why, every year,

42
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:03,256
I petition the mayor's office
to rename Pickens Day...

43
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:04,340
[school bell ringing]

44
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,259
[Haggly] Thank you for that, Cheryl.

45
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,806
Mr. Jones, we look forward
to your oral history report next week.

46
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:15,393
The students we transferred
to Riverdale High are fine,

47
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:18,146
but their parents are in my office,
every day,

48
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:20,231
wanting me to reopen Southside High.

49
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:23,610
Which is why we've been discussing
how our new neighborhood

50
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:25,778
could use something positive to focus on.

51
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:29,157
With your blessing,
we'd like to make Pickens Day bigger,

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,658
more of a celebratory event.

53
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:32,744
[Hiram] Sponsored by Lodge Industries.

54
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:34,787
And Andrews Construction co-sponsoring.

55
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:39,459
You mean you wanna turn Pickens Day
into a commercial for your SoDale project.

56
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,002
Like your open house.

57
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:42,920
[Veronica] Au contraire, Madam Mayor.

58
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:45,673
The open house was for investors.

59
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:49,969
But this event would be
for North-and Southsiders alike.

60
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:51,888
Two halves of a whole coming together...

61
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,516
To distract people with a party?
What if it backfires, things get violent?

62
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,936
What about the Serpents?
They've been quiet, but they're wildcards.

63
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,314
- They could cause trouble.
- [Hiram] We've thought of that.

64
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:03,483
We're offered to hire them
as event security.

65
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:05,568
Fred, you're on board with this?

66
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,071
[Fred] Well, FP told me the Serpents
are looking for work.

67
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,947
Figure we let them keep the peace.

68
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,201
You had your reasons
for closing down Southside High,

69
00:03:13,284 --> 00:03:16,120
but this is an opportunity
to let the Southside know

70
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:18,790
- you're not turning your back on them.
- Hey, Dad.

71
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:20,500
- Hey, bud.
- Archie.

72
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:22,293
Sorry to interrupt.

73
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:25,588
- Mind if I join you guys?
- Actually, we're just finishing up.

74
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:26,547
Mm-hm.

75
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,257
- Thanks, Fred, for having us.
- Yeah.

76
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,510
Madam Mayor,
you'll let us know in the morning?

77
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:34,180
- Hey, Mr. Lodge.
- Excuse me, Archie.

78
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:39,185
Hey.

79
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:40,269
Oh, um...

80
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,063
I'd kiss you, but you're sweaty.

81
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:46,776
So, how long do you plan
on staying with us, Chic?

82
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,236
For as long as he wants.

83
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,279
I'm just trying to plan my life, Alice.

84
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,284
And since we're not getting any answers
about anything...

85
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:57,161
What would you like to know, Hal?

86
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:59,706
For starters,
Betty brought you here all bloody.

87
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:01,374
Why? What happened?

88
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:02,291
Dad.

89
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,252
You don't have to, Chic

90
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:08,673
The person who attacked me,
his name's Marcel.

91
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,468
He runs the hostel.
Sometimes he books clients for us.

92
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:16,097
The night you showed up, Betty,
I wasn't in the mood to work.

93
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,182
Marcel was trying
to convince me otherwise.

94
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:21,602
- So, what kind of clients?
- Hal.

95
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:23,062
No, I wanna know, too.

96
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:23,980
Betty.

97
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,148
All kinds.

98
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:28,484
Ranging from nice to, hell,
even nastier than Marcel.

99
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:32,113
I, uh, can go into specifics,
if you'd like.

100
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:34,866
I've also got a good collection
of scars I could show you.

101
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:36,117
I have scars, too.

102
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,953
Crescent moons on my palms.

103
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:40,663
From digging your nails in?

104
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:43,499
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I used to do that, too.

105
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:46,753
Syrup.

106
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:47,962
[Alice clearing throat]

107
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:55,344
If and when the U.S. government
brings actions against Hiram Lodge

108
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,139
before any domestic court of law,

109
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,475
that agreement
ensures your father's immunity.

110
00:05:00,558 --> 00:05:03,770
This is nuts. The Lodges were just
at my house planning a party.

111
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:06,355
- When was this? Who was there?
- Last night.

112
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:10,902
And it was Mr. and Mrs. Lodge, my dad,
the sheriff, Mayor McCoy, and...

113
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:12,570
That's it.

114
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:15,490
- Why weren't you a part of this?
- I was playing basketball.

115
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:17,742
Agent Adams,
what can we do to speed things up?

116
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,996
I just... I wanna get through this,
and back to my life, my normal life.

117
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,916
Do you have any relationship
with Hiram Lodge? Directly?

118
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:26,000
[scoffs]

119
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:29,962
- Nothing. He doesn't even like me.
- Then let's change that.

120
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:33,716
You have to establish trust,
get him to lower his guard around you.

121
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,927
The sooner you get access
to his inner circle,

122
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,513
the sooner we'll get what we need
to bring him in.

123
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:42,517
Then you can go back to playing
in the band with your pals and gals.

124
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:49,816
Well, he is very fetching
for someone who was living on skid row.

125
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:53,319
Yeah, he's a hottie who looks
incredibly familiar to me, by the way.

126
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:56,405
- Your adventures in the woods?
- Maybe if we were allowed

127
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,492
- to meet this hottie in person...
- [Betty] Chic is still acclimating.

128
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:01,369
And I'm trying to get him to trust me,

129
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:03,788
but my mom is treating him
like he's a 10-year-old,

130
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:06,457
and my dad's acting
like he's the devil's spawn.

131
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,543
Well, I have an amazing idea.

132
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:11,170
Bring The Omen to Pickens Day,
and we can all meet him.

133
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:12,463
Everyone's coming, right?

134
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:16,509
- No. Because the Serpents weren't invited.
- Serpents were specifically asked to come.

135
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:20,513
Yeah, to provide security.
Like we're all on the Snowpiercer train,

136
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:22,598
but the Serpents are
eating the cockroaches.

137
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,976
[Veronica] You don't have to work
if you don't want to.

138
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:28,312
[sighs] The damage, as they say,
has already been done.

139
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:31,274
- I'll talk to you guys later.
- Plans with Toni?

140
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,111
Uh, yeah. I'm interviewing her grandfather
for my oral history report.

141
00:06:35,444 --> 00:06:36,863
Oldest living Serpent.

142
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,287
[Veronica] Archie, what is it?

143
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:49,876
I feel stupid even talking about this,
but... it's about your dad.

144
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,546
I get the feeling
he doesn't really like me.

145
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,047
What?

146
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:57,425
No, that's not...

147
00:06:58,134 --> 00:06:59,218
That's not true.

148
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:02,805
Okay, maybe it's a little true,

149
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,725
but it's not anything you're doing,
per se. It's more that...

150
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,228
For starters, you don't speak Spanish.

151
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:11,814
I can drop French
and start taking Spanish.

152
00:07:12,023 --> 00:07:15,818
- This is really bothering you, isn't it?
- To be honest, yeah.

153
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,529
Do you have any suggestions
on what I can do?

154
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,199
To endear yourself to Daddy?

155
00:07:24,118 --> 00:07:27,246
Well... now that we're talking about it...

156
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,582
[Archie] What, your dad likes wrestling?

157
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:33,336
He was captain of Riverdale High's
wrestling team back in the day.

158
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:36,923
Says it changed his life.
Now that the season's starting back up,

159
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:39,175
it's like my mom and I
are background extras

160
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,718
in the movie Foxcatcher.

161
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,679
Wrestling? Really?

162
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,349
Lodge Industries
basically bankrolls the team.

163
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,769
He was just asking his old coach
if he could sit in on tryouts.

164
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:54,941
God, Ronnie, you know what's super weird?
I was just telling Reggie

165
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:57,735
how I was gonna take a break
from basketball this year.

166
00:07:57,818 --> 00:08:00,571
It'd absolutely score you points
with my dad.

167
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,741
[Jughead]
Thanks again for meeting with me.

168
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:07,495
Toni told me that you're one
of the founding members of the Serpents.

169
00:08:07,578 --> 00:08:11,082
Yes. The snake, the laws,
all based on Uktena tradition.

170
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,503
Who were the Uktena?

171
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:19,548
Uktena is a serpent,
a horned serpent or water serpent.

172
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:23,844
Before there was Riverdale,
all this land belonged to the Uktena.

173
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,180
How'd the Uktena evolve into Serpents?

174
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:27,848
[laughing]

175
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:31,143
The Uktena, we didn't evolve.

176
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:33,271
We were all slaughtered.

177
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,857
When my grandpa was a baby,
there was a raid.

178
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:40,361
And it was led by your hero there,
General Pickens,

179
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:42,780
in a battle, if you wanna call it that.

180
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:46,617
Only lasted for 12 minutes.

181
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,912
But the slaughter was total and savage.

182
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,123
The General Pickens?

183
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,959
Whose statue stands proudly
in Pickens Park?

184
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:59,297
Yes. And every year the Northside honors
this man who massacred children.

185
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,798
When my grandpa died,

186
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:03,843
we formed the Serpents as a way
to keep the family together.

187
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:06,929
- How do people not know about this?
- Ah, some do, but...

188
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,558
It's called the whitewashing of history,
Jones.

189
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:14,228
What, did you think Jason Blossom
was the first person

190
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:15,938
to be murdered in Riverdale?

191
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:23,154
You know I'm down to help,
but why can't it just be the two of us

192
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:25,072
singing a duet at Pickens Day?

193
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,076
I mean, it could be,
but the Pussycats are a brand.

194
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,536
Why let it sit fallow?

195
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:36,334
Josie. Veronica. What's this all about?

196
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:40,504
We are bringing back the Pussycats
to play Pickens Day.

197
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:41,964
Whose idea was that?

198
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,966
Uh, it was Veronica's.

199
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,218
Weren't we focusing on your solo career?

200
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:49,638
We could bill it as a special event,
one night only.

201
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,182
I was talking to my daughter.

202
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:55,144
In fact, why don't we continue
this conversation later

203
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,562
when it's just us two?

204
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,612
[cell phone buzzing]

205
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:07,615
- Hey, Kev, what's up?
- Are you somewhere where you can talk?

206
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:08,699
Yeah, why?

207
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,160
I just remembered where I know Chic from.

208
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,246
He's a video gigolo,
a webcam boy, a cyber trick.

209
00:10:16,123 --> 00:10:17,416
[inaudible dialogue]

210
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:23,416
== Synced & corrected by <font color="#00FFFF">MaxPayne</font> ==

211
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,401
Mom.

212
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:40,657
A really weird thing happened
when I was at Josie's last night.

213
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,493
Mayor McCoy was acting
like I was a bad seed,

214
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,078
out to corrupt her daughter.

215
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:47,330
I don't believe Sierra is comfortable

216
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:50,249
with how we let you become involved
in the business.

217
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,628
- Why does she even care?
- She's afraid you're gonna tell Josie.

218
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:55,838
- I'd never...
- Of course not, mija.

219
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:59,133
And I am not making excuses for Sierra.

220
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:07,517
In fact, should her coldness persist...
I'll happily have a conversation with her.

221
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,864
[Hiram] Thought basketball was your sport.

222
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:24,242
- I'm branching out.
- Ah.

223
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:28,496
- What are you doing here, Mr. Lodge?
- Just, uh, checking out the team.

224
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,581
- I wrestled in high school.
- Really?

225
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:33,000
- No, I didn't know that.
- What weight class you in?

226
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:35,253
One seventy-five,
I'm trying to get down to 170.

227
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:38,548
Hey, Andrews. It's a good thing
you're not in my weight class.

228
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,466
I'd wreck you, Gingerbread Man.

229
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,261
[whistle blowing]

230
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:45,304
Let's bring it in.

231
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:52,729
Firstly, I wanna thank a gentleman
who's really showing his support

232
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,691
for the team this year.
He wrestled for me my first year as coach.

233
00:11:57,191 --> 00:12:02,113
That is Hiram "The Ram" Lodge.
Guys, let's show him some appreciation.

234
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:03,698
[all applauding]

235
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:07,577
Thank you.

236
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,582
Listen up.
Not everyone will make the team this year.

237
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:17,128
There'll be cuts every day, boys,
so, make each match count.

238
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,213
All right. Pair off.

239
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:20,256
Up-and-downs.

240
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,174
Let's go.

241
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:26,179
You do know wrestling's
not like football or basketball, right?

242
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:29,348
I went up against Moose
in the Oklahoma Drill, Kev. I'm good.

243
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:32,185
[sighs]

244
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,068
[whistle blowing]

245
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:42,445
[grunting]

246
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,197
[Keller] Thattaboy.

247
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:45,907
Okay, reset.

248
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,824
Again.

249
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:50,870
[whistle blowing]

250
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,664
[panting]

251
00:12:59,587 --> 00:13:01,798
[Kevin] It felt so good, Betty.

252
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,884
It's like, "Archie, you have the physique
of a 1970s porn star,

253
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:08,054
- but that doesn't mean you can wrestle."
- Speaking of porn stars...

254
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,348
Did you get lost
down a webcam rabbit hole?

255
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:13,017
It's fascinating.

256
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,021
I brought Chic home to help my mom
without knowing who he was,

257
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:20,775
and now to find out
he's actually multiple people,

258
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:22,360
performing online...

259
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:26,239
How do I broach that with him?
Do I broach that with him?

260
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:27,156
[knocking on door]

261
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:29,075
Hey. Am I interrupting?

262
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:30,535
- Yeah, kind of...
- No.

263
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,829
I wanted to run stuff by you.
I can come back.

264
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,205
No, no, no, it's fine.

265
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:36,290
Bye.

266
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,419
By the way, I'm really digging
Kevin's new gossip column.

267
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,547
Readers love it.

268
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,342
And I needed to fill the extra space
when you...

269
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,887
I'm actually working on a story right now.
Here.

270
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:54,725
When I interviewed Toni's grandfather,
he had some pretty intense things to say

271
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:58,229
about General Pickens.
But I did some follow-up research.

272
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:01,148
General Pickens was hired
by Barnabas B. Blossom

273
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:03,317
to remove the Uktena tribe by force.

274
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:08,656
Betty, he killed 400 innocent men,
women, and children.

275
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:10,324
My God, that's horrible.

276
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:11,742
And adding salt to the wound,

277
00:14:11,826 --> 00:14:13,870
the last remnants of the tribe,
the Serpents,

278
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,621
are being squeezed out of existence.

279
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:19,417
Toni's grandfather lives
in a trailer the size of a broom closet.

280
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,837
Hiram Lodge is honoring this murderer,
instead of trying to make amends.

281
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,298
I think it's a story we need to tell.

282
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,177
Will you try to get a quote from Hiram?

283
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:31,470
[Veronica] Kevin told me what happened.

284
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,393
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

285
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,646
Bruised ego, more than anything.
But Kevin's gonna work with me,

286
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,481
- get me up to speed.
- Great.

287
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:46,277
But should you
not be a natural-born wrestler,

288
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,238
I thought of another way
you might curry my father's favor.

289
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:53,951
Though Pickens Day is taking a backseat
to his wrestling obsession,

290
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:56,913
he will be there,
and I suspect he'd be tickled

291
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,998
to see you sing with me and Josie.

292
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:08,549
Chic. Hey.

293
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:11,636
- He threw out my stuff.
- What? Who did? What stuff?

294
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,222
Marcel, my landlord, the guy you maced?

295
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:16,933
He got rid of everything.
Everything I need to survive.

296
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,686
- My laptop, my camera...
- You went back there? And talked to him?

297
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,190
- After what he was doing to you?
- My entire life was at that hostel.

298
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:26,692
Like my mom said,
you can stay here as long you want.

299
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:30,238
- You don't think this is long-term.
- I don't know. Maybe.

300
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,448
Wow. Wow.

301
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:36,160
If you believe that,
you're even crazier than I thought.

302
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:39,664
[phone ringing]

303
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:46,295
- This is Hiram.
- [Jughead over phone] Hi, Mr. Lodge?

304
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:48,381
Yeah, this is Jughead Jones,

305
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:51,217
I'm writing an article
about how General Pickens

306
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,303
massacred the Uktena tribe
and stole the land you're building on.

307
00:16:13,864 --> 00:16:14,991
[sighs]

308
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,274

310
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:55,698
I'm sorry he sold all your stuff.

315
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:19,764
Hey. What are you guys doing in here?

316
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:23,225
We're just working
on some Pickens Day songs.

317
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:24,685
Archie's agreed to help.

318
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,645
Yeah, we can take it to the living room,

319
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:27,938
- Mr. Lodge...
- No. No.

320
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:29,690
Not at all.

321
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:31,067
I have to say,

322
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:36,197
the thought of you two being
in here alone used to upset me deeply.

323
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:40,493
After seeing your performance today,
Archie, for some reason I'm less worried.

324
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:43,329
- Daddy, be nice.
- Not everyone can wrestle.

325
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,248
- It takes a certain kind of man...
- Excuse me, "man"?

326
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:50,795
My point is there's no shame,
Archie, in admitting defeat.

327
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:55,674
And accepting the fact that you're more
suited to singing with the Pussycats.

328
00:17:55,758 --> 00:18:00,471
Daddy,
Archie may not be a star wrestler yet,

329
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:04,141
but he's an incredible musician.

330
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,770
And bonus for me,
incredibly sexy when he sings.

331
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:10,940
Thanks, babe.

332
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,734
Ah.

333
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:23,202
Maybe I shouldn't be spreading myself
too thin these days.

334
00:18:24,495 --> 00:18:25,413
Honestly?

335
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:28,833
Yeah, I should get home,
practice some moves Kevin showed me.

336
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,711
But I'll see you at tryouts tomorrow,
I hope?

337
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,464
Yeah.

338
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:44,306
Do you know who used to sit there?

339
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,934
- Dad.
- Our daughter, Polly.

340
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,354
You sit in her chair,
you sleep in her bed.

341
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:52,273
You're filling a void.

342
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:55,818
That's the reason you're here.
The only reason.

343
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,321
It's okay, it doesn't bother me.

344
00:19:00,948 --> 00:19:02,575
Everyone needs something.

345
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,537
And I don't expect to stay here for free.

346
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,830
I never have.

347
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,044
[whistle blowing]

348
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,755
[Kleats]
We're focusing on fundamentals today.

349
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:20,176
Starting with the fireman's carry.

350
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,471
And since it was his signature move,
back in the day,

351
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:26,265
I've asked Hiram Lodge here
to demonstrate.

352
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,101
Ram, will you do us the honor?

353
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:33,481
All right, then. I need a volunteer.

354
00:19:37,818 --> 00:19:38,819
Archie Andrews.

355
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:42,448
Come on.

356
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:50,289
- What are you waiting for?
- Mr. Lodge?

357
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:51,999
Come at me. Come on.

358
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:04,261
This is a simple but effective move
when your opponent gets cocky.

359
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:08,057
Dominating your rival,
demoralizing him...

360
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,101
is the key if you want to win.

361
00:20:11,185 --> 00:20:12,311
[grunting]

362
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:16,899
Get the message. I always win.

363
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,571
[Toni] "General Pickens was a murderer,

364
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,325
and ripples from his gruesome acts
continue to be felt today.

365
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:29,995
Descendants of the victims
are still being displaced.

366
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,956
So, I challenge the Northside,

367
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,042
instead of honoring men
like General Pickens and Hiram Lodge,

368
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,752
hold them accountable.

369
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,672
Reparations must be paid
to men like Thomas Topaz,

370
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:43,842
who are too old and beaten down
to fight back for themselves"?

371
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:46,929
This town is messed up,
and it needs to own up to its history.

372
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,474
My grandfather
isn't some broken-down victim. Okay?

373
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,228
Or some prop for your insane vendetta
against the Northside.

374
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:55,938
- No, of course not.
- Look.

375
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:57,273
I get it.

376
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,025
You hate the Northside.

377
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:05,197
You hate that instead of inviting you
to a party, they asked you to work it.

378
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:10,411
It triggers your rage about being born
on the wrong side of the tracks. But this?

379
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:14,957
This wasn't your story to tell.

380
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:21,130
[sighs]

381
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,887
[McCoy] I can't cancel Pickens Day,
but I don't want you performing at it.

382
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:31,974
With the town riled up over this article?
What if there's a riot?

383
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,060
No one's rioting, Mom,
and I promised Veronica.

384
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:36,520
Okay, well, I'm sorry,

385
00:21:36,604 --> 00:21:40,441
you can tell her that the Pussycats
aren't hers to order around.

386
00:21:40,524 --> 00:21:42,901
Why is Veronica triggering you
all of a sudden?

387
00:21:43,444 --> 00:21:46,530
Baby,
let me tell you something about Veronica.

388
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,783
And her parents.
And the way they do business.

389
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:54,204
And the way they use their daughter
to do their business.

390
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:58,417
<i>♪ Nightshades on a warning ♪</i>

391
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:02,546
<i>♪ Give me strength or give me light ♪</i>

392
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:06,842
<i>♪ Give me anything
Even sympathy ♪</i>

393
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:08,552
<i>♪ There's a cha... ♪</i>

394
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:10,971
- You're late.
- I'm out.

395
00:22:11,055 --> 00:22:12,723
I'm not performing at Pickens Day.

396
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:14,224
- Wait, what?
- It's just...

397
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,269
I don't like being manipulated by a Lodge.

398
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:20,773
What?
Josie, is your mom making you do this?

399
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,608
My mom?

400
00:22:23,984 --> 00:22:27,237
Whatever she
and your parents have going on,

401
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:30,491
that's between them.
She doesn't want me to be a part of it.

402
00:22:30,574 --> 00:22:33,077
My mom says she may have
to do what your parents want,

403
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,954
- but I don't have to do what you want.
- What? Josie...

404
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,517
Cameras aren't here, Jackie O.
And what about Jughead's article?

405
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,519
What about it, Cheryl?

406
00:22:58,602 --> 00:23:01,313
It says
that Great-great-great-grandpappy Blossom

407
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:04,149
hired General Pickens
to steal land from the Uktena.

408
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:08,904
Well, how do you think we got started
in the maple syrup business? Help me up.

409
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:18,038
But then that means
our family is partly responsible

410
00:23:18,122 --> 00:23:21,417
for killing literally hundreds of people.

411
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,795
For what? A bunch of maple trees?

412
00:23:25,254 --> 00:23:26,839
It wasn't just trees.

413
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:28,715
Dark, fertile earth.

414
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,637
A mighty river. Back in those early days,
we had a hand in everything.

415
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:37,349
Building the rail roads,
operating the saloons.

416
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,977
And, yes, even a brothel.

417
00:23:40,644 --> 00:23:42,688
The old ways die hard, it seems.

418
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:54,533
- [Kevin] You're definitely getting better.
- I appreciate the help, Kevin.

419
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:57,411
- You're a legend.
- Anytime. Can I ask something?

420
00:23:57,744 --> 00:23:58,871
Why wrestling?

421
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:02,124
Why now?
I mean, trying to impress Mr. Lodge?

422
00:24:04,418 --> 00:24:07,463
To be honest, it didn't start there.

423
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,011
But now... yeah, it's like there's nothing
I can do to earn his respect.

424
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,891
And the more he looks down on me,
the more I wanna show him that he's wrong.

425
00:24:21,685 --> 00:24:24,771
Yeah. It's personal now.

426
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:28,775
- [Chic] Why'd you buy me that laptop?
- Oh, um...

427
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:33,238
I didn't. It's just an old computer I had
from the Register.

428
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:34,740
Why'd you come get me?

429
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:37,993
You're my brother.

430
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,664
And my mom was depressed...

431
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,918
No. Sorry, everything is a transaction.

432
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:51,590
No one, not even you, is that nice.
So, why do you care, Betty?

433
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:55,594
What do you want?
And careful, I'll know if you're lying.

434
00:24:57,221 --> 00:25:00,098
To figure out why I am the way that I am.

435
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:04,228
There's a darkness in me
that I don't understand.

436
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:06,063
That scares me.

437
00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:12,027
And I thought that maybe,
if you had it, too, which I think you do,

438
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,655
you'd be able to help me make sense of it.

439
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:19,618
I know about the webcamming.
That's why I got you the computer.

440
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,331
So, if you ever wanna talk about that,
or compare scars...

441
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:26,124
No, thanks, I'll pass.

442
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:32,089
[Archie] I told the doorman I was here
to see Veronica.

443
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:35,676
And I'll have speak to Andre about that.
What is it, Archie?

444
00:25:36,176 --> 00:25:39,930
Why don't you like me, Mr. Lodge?
Why? What did I ever do to you?

445
00:25:41,682 --> 00:25:43,100
You really asking that?

446
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:47,354
- You really don't know?
- Yeah, I am, and no, I don't.

447
00:25:47,437 --> 00:25:51,108
Your father slept with another man's wife.

448
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,237
And why shouldn't I assume
you have the same weak character?

449
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,490
I'm not my dad, Mr. Lodge. I would never...

450
00:25:58,574 --> 00:25:59,992
Maybe that's true,

451
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:04,621
but still, you're not good enough
for my daughter in any respect.

452
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:07,583
You're not worthy.
You'll never be able to take care of her.

453
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,251
I did while you were in prison.

454
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,168
Excuse me?

455
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:14,381
When she and Mrs. Lodge
moved to Riverdale,

456
00:26:14,464 --> 00:26:16,675
I was there for your daughter.
You couldn't be.

457
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:18,260
You would say that to me?

458
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,387
In my house?

459
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:22,764
[Veronica]
What the hell is going on in here?

460
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,892
- Veronica, ahem...
- Hey, we were just...

461
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:28,895
Having some juvenile
chest-thumping contest?

462
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:30,022
No. Not at all.

463
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:34,192
I just asked Archie to come over
and plan some one-on-one training.

464
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:38,322
Really? That why it looks like
you're about to kill each other?

465
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:49,392
[cell phone buzzing]

466
00:26:56,793 --> 00:26:59,170
- Hello?
- [Hiram] Meet me outside in five minutes.

467
00:27:01,214 --> 00:27:02,089
Mr. Lodge?

468
00:27:02,757 --> 00:27:03,716
What time is it?

469
00:27:05,301 --> 00:27:06,511
[call disconnects]

470
00:27:23,736 --> 00:27:25,571
[pop music playing]

471
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:27,323
[Hiram] Thank you.

472
00:27:29,784 --> 00:27:31,869
You know why I love wrestling?

473
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:35,081
Because when it's two men on the mat,
it doesn't matter who you are.

474
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:38,334
Or where you come from.
Or how strong you are.

475
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:41,629
It's about sheer will.
And knowing your opponent.

476
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:45,174
Maybe even better than he knows himself.

477
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:50,096
Which is why, Archie...

478
00:27:51,597 --> 00:27:53,057
you will never win.

479
00:27:55,184 --> 00:27:57,019
- What are you talking about?
- Veronica...

480
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:01,816
has a lot on her plate.
And I don't want her worrying about us.

481
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:05,528
So, after this morning,
we can say that I helped you.

482
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,198
And that we went for a jog
and we broke bread together.

483
00:28:09,282 --> 00:28:12,159
And I will tolerate you...

484
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:17,665
- until this phase runs its course.
- Runs its course?

485
00:28:17,748 --> 00:28:20,167
You're not the first boy
to turn her head.

486
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:25,798
You see, boyfriends,
they come and they go.

487
00:28:27,133 --> 00:28:28,092
But fathers...

488
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:33,431
fathers are forever.

489
00:28:37,101 --> 00:28:40,062
[Hermione] You're not hungry, mija?
Is it Archie and your dad?

490
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,481
No, it's Josie.

491
00:28:43,024 --> 00:28:46,736
We got into a fight
and she dropped out of Pickens Day.

492
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:47,945
I see.

493
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:51,741
This is Sierra's doing, I assume?

494
00:28:53,451 --> 00:28:54,285
That's it.

495
00:28:55,786 --> 00:28:58,998
- I'm taking care of this.
- No, Mom. It's like you said.

496
00:28:59,081 --> 00:29:02,001
Our family works differently
from other families.

497
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:06,297
If Josie and Mayor McCoy
don't like how we do business,

498
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,256
that's on them.

499
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:10,384
But the show must go on.

500
00:29:12,428 --> 00:29:15,223
I was angry,
because the Southside is our home.

501
00:29:16,182 --> 00:29:20,770
I'm sick of watching it get dismantled,
piece by piece, in front of our eyes.

502
00:29:21,604 --> 00:29:24,357
They take our drive-in,
then take our school.
