1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,923
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:03,391
- My dad, he's...
- A mobster.

3
00:00:03,393 --> 00:00:05,693
Archie, it's not just what he is,

4
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:08,062
it's what he's planning
to do. In Riverdale.

5
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:09,429
I don't need to know.

6
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:12,300
Smithers, would you describe
my father as a good man?

7
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:13,434
I'd rather not say, miss.

8
00:00:13,436 --> 00:00:15,637
Oh, my God! What happened to the twins?

9
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:19,240
- I had them, Betty.
- You didn't call us. Mom will be crushed.

10
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:20,903
He has to go, Alice.

11
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:22,710
Chic, he's kinda creepy.

12
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:24,340
I just remembered
where I knew Chic from.

13
00:00:24,343 --> 00:00:26,180
He's a video gigolo, a web cam boy.

14
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:29,083
My parents, they know about
the affair with Sheriff Keller.

15
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:31,219
- I have decided...
- Mayor McCoy's resigning.

16
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:34,085
Hiram Lodge. He just bought
Sunnyside Trailer Park

17
00:00:34,088 --> 00:00:35,354
and he said we can all stay.

18
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:38,054
He's gobbling up the
Southside piece by piece.

19
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:44,197
I was running out of time.

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,466
And maybe, so was Riverdale.

21
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:50,171
Hiram Lodge had been making moves.

22
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:53,739
Big moves. But with no
proof of criminal behavior,

23
00:00:53,742 --> 00:00:55,529
all I could do was speculate.

24
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:59,514
What was Hiram's master
plan for Riverdale?

25
00:00:59,516 --> 00:01:02,550
And why did it feel
so close to fruition?

26
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:05,887
Hey.

27
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:08,541
What's all this?

28
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:12,160
Hopefully, this is the article that
saves the town from Hiram Lodge.

29
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:14,195
- Jughead...
- If I can fit the pieces together.

30
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:16,030
Boy, you need to drop
this. He rescued us.

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,666
He bought the trailer
park, forgave our debts.

32
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:21,169
What? He's the reason we
almost lost the trailer park.

33
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:24,372
Hiram's slicker than a bottle of
snake oil, no doubt, but this is...

34
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:27,072
Dad, please!

35
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:30,260
Hiram Lodge just bought
The Riverdale Register.

36
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:33,815
He's trying to silence dissenting
voices before he makes his big play.

37
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:36,959
He's afraid. He's
afraid of this exposure.

38
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:40,629
If you remember
correctly, the only house

39
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:42,656
in Riverdale with a
pool was Thornhill...

40
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,727
There we were, two drunk, dumb
teenagers looking to cool off...

41
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:48,372
Why didn't you just go to the
quarry? Or Sweetwater River?

42
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,068
Oh, what I remember is

43
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:53,300
someone borrowing the school van
for a joy ride, you and Mary...

44
00:01:53,303 --> 00:01:54,936
No, that was Alice, not us.

45
00:01:54,938 --> 00:01:58,106
Oh, my God, this sounds like
an episode of Saved by the Bell.

46
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:02,987
Hey, Fred, before you
head off, why don't

47
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,810
you join Hermione and me in the study?

48
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:07,474
I have this 30-year-old
rum. I think you'll love it.

49
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:10,119
Well, I can't say no to that.

50
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:12,954
- Veronica, stay with Archie?
- Mmm-hmm.

51
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:19,560
Betty, I can't keep doing this anymore.

52
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:21,833
He's your brother and it is weird.

53
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:24,812
Kevin, every time I try asking
Chic questions about himself,

54
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:28,346
he gets defensive or literally
starts to cry as a diversion.

55
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,812
- You're catfishing him?
- If it's the only way to get Chic to open up.

56
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:33,415
I...

57
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:46,754
So, do you ever P and P?
You know, Party and Play?

58
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:49,824
You keep asking me that
and I keep telling you no.

59
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:51,941
You know...

60
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:54,403
This is our third time cam-ing

61
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:57,165
and you haven't really told
me anything about yourself.

62
00:02:57,168 --> 00:03:01,055
Yeah, well, you haven't taken
your shirt off yet. So we're even.

63
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:04,183
I'm shy.

64
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:12,668
Okay. What do you wanna know?

65
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:15,183
What are they talking about
in there, do you reckon?

66
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:19,554
So, between us, the deputy mayor
who took over for Josie's mom

67
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:22,223
is on the verge of stepping down.

68
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:24,659
There's gonna be a special election

69
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:29,397
and my parents think your dad
would make an ideal candidate.

70
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,165
They want my dad to run for mayor?

71
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:33,078
It's business and politics, Archie.

72
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:35,161
They go hand in hand.

73
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:38,406
Dad, is this something
you're seriously considering?

74
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:44,011
Being mayor is something I dreamed about

75
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:47,415
ever since I was a little kid,
son, in the back of my mind.

76
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:50,251
And I know Riverdale's
had a lot of downs lately

77
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:53,083
but maybe, I can help get
it back up on an upswing.

78
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:56,379
And you don't think it's weird
that Mr. Lodge is asking you to run?

79
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:59,527
He's not dumb, son. He spends
a lot of money in Riverdale.

80
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:01,662
It makes sense he wants a
friend in the mayor's office.

81
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,097
Will he pay for your campaign?

82
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:07,468
He offered to make a donation
to help me get going, but...

83
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,382
But to be clear, Archie,
if I decide to run,

84
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:15,343
it won't be for him,
it'll be for Riverdale.

85
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:17,745
For me.

86
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:20,481
For you.

87
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:34,662
Mother. Strange man I've never met.

88
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:37,732
Cheryl, this is Mr.
Lazenby, our estate attorney.

89
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:40,635
Your father, as it turns
out, left a secret will.

90
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:43,497
Of course he did.

91
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,573
But Daddy died months ago.

92
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:48,910
And Mr. Blossom's instructions were
to reveal the existence of his will

93
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:51,145
only after the authorities had concluded

94
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:53,047
their investigation
into his side business.

95
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:54,715
You mean drug dealing?

96
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:56,417
Does this mean we're
gonna be rich again?

97
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:58,452
Oh, Cheryl, don't be so gauche.

98
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:01,756
Per Clifford's instructions, he
requested I withhold all information,

99
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,709
including the names of his numerous

100
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:06,095
beneficiaries, until
a public will-reading.

101
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,234
That's tomorrow afternoon.

102
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:14,135
It's been a long time coming, Alice,
but I'm out. I'm done fighting.

103
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:16,871
I want a divorce.

104
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:20,043
- Are you still seeing Penelope Blossom?
- No.

105
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:22,209
And this isn't about that.

106
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:26,681
This is about how I worshiped
you like a goddess for 20 years.

107
00:05:26,683 --> 00:05:28,849
We raised a family together,

108
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:30,483
and then the first chance that you get,

109
00:05:30,486 --> 00:05:33,253
you side with a stranger over me?

110
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:35,056
And you too, Betty. I can't believe

111
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:38,192
that you would choose Chic's
side over your own father.

112
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:41,764
Dad, if this is truly about
Chic, then I'm with you, okay?

113
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,397
Let's ask him to move out.

114
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,767
You sold The Register to
that scumbag Hiram Lodge.

115
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:48,336
I should be the one divorcing you!

116
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:51,285
Hiram offered me a fairer price, Alice.

117
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:54,108
Half of which I will give to you,

118
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:56,991
if you agree to set me free...

119
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:58,460
Immediately.

120
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:01,315
I'm listening.

121
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:08,589
I put the odds of Fred
saying yes at about 50-50.

122
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:12,032
As always, mija, anything you
can whisper in Archie's ear?

123
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:15,262
Mom, he's my boyfriend,
not a constituent.

124
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:17,488
Ah, you influence Archie and Archie

125
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:20,267
influences Fred, and
we need Fred right now.

126
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:22,069
When we announce our bigger plans...

127
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:25,206
It'd sound better coming out of his
well-respected, well-liked mouth.

128
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:27,743
Fine. I'll do my best.

129
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:31,082
Are you still going after Hiram Lodge?

130
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:33,226
Well, that depends.

131
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:35,182
Who's asking? You?

132
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:37,718
Veronica? The archfiend himself?

133
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:42,597
Jug, there's gonna be a special
election to replace Josie's mom.

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,292
- Hiram Lodge wants my dad to run.
- What? Why?

135
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:46,964
Who freaking knows? Jughead, I'm with

136
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:49,030
Veronica, so that means
I'm with the Lodges.

137
00:06:49,032 --> 00:06:50,931
But my dad,

138
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:53,034
I can't let him get in
any deeper with them.

139
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:54,568
So tell him he shouldn't run.

140
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:58,140
Veronica would kill me if
I did. And ditto the Lodges.

141
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:01,042
Maybe I could give you something.

142
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:05,179
Maybe you could write about it and
that might make my dad hit pause.

143
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:06,815
Okay.

144
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:10,432
You remember when Hiram
Lodge gave Pop Tate

145
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:12,353
that charitable donation
to keep that diner open?

146
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:13,443
Yeah, we were all there.

147
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:15,890
Except Hiram Lodge didn't
give Pop's a donation.

148
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:17,591
- He bought the diner.
- What?

149
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:20,561
And for some reason, he doesn't
want anyone to know about it.

150
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:22,329
Can you do something with that fact?

151
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:24,292
At least enough to make my dad think

152
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:26,200
twice about this stupid mayor idea.

153
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:28,636
- He bought the diner?
- Yes!

154
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:34,842
God! Hiram is like Dracula.

155
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:36,758
Snapping up properties from all over

156
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:39,530
Riverdale to expand his empire and feed.

157
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:42,611
If what you're telling me is true,

158
00:07:42,614 --> 00:07:44,784
everyone is in danger.

159
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,385
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

160
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,621
I figured out Hiram's methodology.

161
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:55,933
He acquires devalued land at a deep,

162
00:07:55,936 --> 00:07:58,054
some might say criminal discount.

163
00:07:58,056 --> 00:08:00,090
Twilight Drive-In,
Sunnyside Trailer Park,

164
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:02,492
Southside High, and now
Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

165
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:04,494
- Wait, Pop's?
- Hiram bought Pop's?

166
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:06,184
Yeah. And while most people didn't

167
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:07,910
care about Hiram's other acquisitions,

168
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:09,599
probably because they
were on the Southside...

169
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:11,635
Pop's is the heart of Riverdale.

170
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:13,904
Right. People will care about this one.

171
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:16,339
So, when are you talking to Pop?

172
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:19,732
I was doing some
research and apparently,

173
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:21,477
your dad needs 1,200 signatures

174
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,785
- before he can even run for mayor.
- Uh-huh.

175
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:26,750
So I was thinking, if
you're not doing anything,

176
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:28,809
maybe we can collect them together.

177
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:30,363
You know what?

178
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:31,995
I actually have some homework
I have to catch up on.

179
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:33,790
- I'll talk to you later.
- Wait, Archie...

180
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:47,936
Polly, what are you doing home again?

181
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:50,640
She just walked through the
door with these perfect babies.

182
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:52,776
I thought it would be
nice to surprise Mom.

183
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:57,392
And I was surprised to meet our brother.

184
00:08:58,417 --> 00:08:59,883
You have to hold one.

185
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:01,485
I'd love to.

186
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:04,988
Here.

187
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:12,496
Oh, hello.

188
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:17,868
Hey, where's Dad, by the way?

189
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,136
Are we all gonna go to
the will-reading together?

190
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:22,806
- What will-reading?
- What?

191
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:25,308
You... You mean Dad hasn't told you?

192
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:31,561
Cheryl, I agreed to come to this

193
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:34,286
will-reading but I didn't
agree to a makeover.

194
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:38,124
Unless it involves that blouse.

195
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:40,506
Nice, right?

196
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:44,594
For the record, j'adore
your flannel mesh aesthetic.

197
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:48,999
I'm merely augmenting
it for the occasion.

198
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:51,970
What is going on in here, Cheryl?

199
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:55,572
Mrs. Blossom, hi, I'm Toni Topaz.

200
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:57,140
I'm a friend of Cheryl's from school

201
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:59,910
and she's lending me an
outfit for the will-reading.

202
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:02,212
And why on Earth would you be there?

203
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:05,849
I invited her to be
my emotional support.

204
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:11,186
Just make sure you're downstairs
before the guests start to arrive.

205
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:14,344
We need to present a united
front against those scavengers.

206
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:19,395
Ugh. She's a nightmare.

207
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:21,898
Isn't she though?

208
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,948
Hey, Arch, check this out!

209
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,070
When I applied to college
to be an urban planner...

210
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:28,872
This is before Grandpa already got sick,

211
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:33,811
this was a presentation that I made
for some program I never got into.

212
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:37,547
Riverdale 2020. Small
town with a big future.

213
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:40,150
- Sounds corny, huh?
- No, Dad, this is awesome.

214
00:10:40,152 --> 00:10:42,725
Hello?

215
00:10:42,728 --> 00:10:45,017
Archie! Mr. Andrews?

216
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:48,491
Oh, goody! You're both here.

217
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:53,545
So I fully realize I'm putting
the cart before the horse,

218
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:55,966
but I was spitballing some design ideas,

219
00:10:55,968 --> 00:11:00,070
and I think I may have come up
with a few potential campaign logos.

220
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:04,007
Veronica, those are terrific,
I gotta say, but... Oh!

221
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:07,811
- Now, that one, that's my favorite. Hmm.
- Mine too.

222
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:15,185
Great. So I'll have some buttons
and T-shirts printed ASAP.

223
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:18,922
Why are you pushing this on him?

224
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:22,726
I'm not. I just think your
dad would make a great mayor.

225
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:24,361
Why are you resisting this so much?

226
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:27,717
Because, Ronnie, my dad is not
cut out for what your parents want.

227
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,699
Which is what, in your mind?

228
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:31,901
A dog on a leash who
does what it's told.

229
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:33,945
And if not, they'll push him
out like they did Mayor McCoy.

230
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:37,907
Archie, Mayor McCoy had an
affair with Sheriff Keller.

231
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:39,175
That's why she stepped down.

232
00:11:39,177 --> 00:11:40,877
My parents had nothing to do with it,

233
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,846
which I would swear to you on the Bible.

234
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:45,082
I feel like you're
steering me, Ronnie, like

235
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:47,219
you're steering my
dad, and it's not cool.

236
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:51,821
So ease off him.

237
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:55,291
Okay.

238
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:02,899
"I, Clifford Cochrane Blossom,
being of sound mind and body,

239
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:07,103
do here inscribe the terms
of my last will and testament.

240
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:09,039
Firstly...

241
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,381
Ownership of Thistlehouse

242
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:15,111
will stay with our beloved
matriarch, Roseanne Blossom.

243
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:19,215
To my wife and partner, Penelope,

244
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:22,318
I leave ownership of
our greatest treasure,

245
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,122
Thornhill, the exquisite
mansion she made a home."

246
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,756
The charred husk of an empty house.

247
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,627
That sounds about right, Mother.

248
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:34,197
Now, the reason I contacted you
and you all traveled to be here.

249
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:40,475
"Any and all remaining assets of
my fortune will be divided in half.

250
00:12:40,478 --> 00:12:44,507
The first half will be distributed
equally to anyone in Riverdale

251
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:47,377
who can prove with
medical authentication

252
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:51,921
that even one drop of Blossom
blood flows through their veins."

253
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:53,787
I knew it!

254
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,554
- Alice, what the hell are you doing here?
- Accusing you publicly.

255
00:12:57,556 --> 00:12:59,823
You only wanted a divorce
so that you could cheat me

256
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:02,459
out of your big, fancy Blossom payday.

257
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:05,829
It's not just my payday, the
girls share Blossom blood too.

258
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,264
My lawyer is gonna rip you apart.

259
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:09,799
Isn't that right, Attorney McCoy?

260
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:13,069
I will be taking half of
whatever blood money you get

261
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:15,772
from this inbred cesspool of a family.

262
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:18,007
Yeah, that's right. I said inbred.

263
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:19,309
Would you please just leave?

264
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:22,779
Shut your face, you
half-melted ten cent trollop!

265
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,248
Oh, this is riveting, I can't breathe.

266
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,419
- Usual, Jughead?
- Not today, Pop.

267
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:31,988
I actually have a question for you.

268
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:35,892
Did Hiram Lodge buy this diner from you?

269
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:47,437
Jughead...

270
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:51,407
The Tates have owned this
diner for over 80 years.

271
00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:54,744
When my ma gave me the keys,

272
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:57,912
she made me promise that no matter what,

273
00:13:57,915 --> 00:14:01,785
I'd always keep this shop in our family.

274
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:06,322
Now, I did what I
needed to with Mr. Lodge

275
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:09,108
but my mother's still
with us, God bless.

276
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:15,045
It would kill her to hear
I went against her wishes.

277
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:20,370
Please, Jug, can you keep this to
yourself while I still have my mom?

278
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,509
And then you can tell whoever you want.

279
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:33,783
Now that the interloper has
been escorted from the premises,

280
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:36,754
we can finish our
business. As I was saying...

281
00:14:36,757 --> 00:14:39,823
"The other half of my fortune
will go to my true heirs,

282
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,658
Jason and Cheryl."

283
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:58,644
As the one true Blossom heir,

284
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,244
I feel it is my sacred
duty to say a few words.

285
00:15:02,113 --> 00:15:03,680
The Blossoms have been bathing in blood

286
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:05,748
since Great-Grandpappy
Blossom killed his brother.

287
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:08,985
The original sin of Riverdale.

288
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:13,957
Well, I stand before
you to say, no more.

289
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:17,327
No more blood.

290
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:20,088
No more madness.

291
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:24,441
No more horror.

292
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:26,336
Here, here.

293
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:30,296
Oh!

294
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:31,960
Couldn't have said it better myself.

295
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:33,630
Oh!

296
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,274
Ugh!

297
00:15:49,378 --> 00:15:53,090
Oh, Mumsy, I had the
most frightful daymare.

298
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:54,893
Daddy was back.

299
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,154
Calm down, it's not what you think.

300
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:02,489
Hello, Cheryl.

301
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,258
I'm your Uncle Claudius.

302
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:07,694
- Twin to your father.
- Twin? But...

303
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:10,230
Daddy never said anything
about having a brother.

304
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:11,831
Well, allow me to explain.

305
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:20,056
When Clifford and I were boys,

306
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:23,468
we were inseparable,
modern-day Romulus and Remus.

307
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:25,645
And it became apparent that I was being

308
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:28,383
primed to inherit the Blossom empire.

309
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,719
Till our 14th birthday.

310
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:36,289
Clifford and I were down by
Sweetwater River and he, uh...

311
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,327
He pointed a rifle at me

312
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,930
and with eyes void of humanity,
he told me about the Blossom curse.

313
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:46,325
How one of the twins
always meets a violent

314
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:49,204
end and often at the hands of the other.

315
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:52,539
Well, he spared me.

316
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:56,809
But that very night, I ran
away from home without a trace.

317
00:16:56,812 --> 00:16:59,705
It broke my heart.

318
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,582
I couldn't bear to speak your name.

319
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:04,918
I joined the Merchant Marines.

320
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,688
I sailed the seas desperate
to outrun the Blossom curse.

321
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:12,559
How soon do you think we could
get those blood tests done?

322
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:14,294
Do you think Dr. Patel
works on weekends?

323
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:17,397
- I'll call and check.
- Polly, what's the rush?

324
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:19,833
I just wanna know how much
money we're inheriting.

325
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:22,068
Between you, me, Chic and the babies,

326
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,337
we could start our own
version of the farm.

327
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,773
Uh, I'm not getting my blood tested.

328
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:29,314
Really, Chic, how come?

329
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:32,130
- Uh, I don't know these people.
- They're your cousins.

330
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:33,999
We're all Blossoms, like it or not.

331
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,648
I'm not, thank the Lord.

332
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:37,050
I don't want their blood money.

333
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:39,686
- Don't be stupid.
- I said, I don't want their money.

334
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:43,456
Besides, needles trigger me.

335
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:45,392
Polly, Betty, leave your brother alone.

336
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:47,160
He can decide for himself.

337
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,831
Mom, I decided something.

338
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:56,236
I'm happy to do the
family's bidding at school,

339
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:58,838
but Archie is off the table.

340
00:18:00,342 --> 00:18:02,575
- You're losing your nerve?
- No!

341
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:06,012
Not even close, but I am
afraid of losing Archie.

342
00:18:06,014 --> 00:18:07,968
He's become a pawn on our chessboard

343
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:09,684
and it's hurting our relationship.

344
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:14,220
Veronica, in this business of ours,

345
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:16,856
the women always walk the razor's edge.

346
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:19,059
The men are the gangsters, but us,

347
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:23,072
the molls, we use our wiles,

348
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:26,866
our cunning, a hand on an elbow,

349
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:29,337
a whisper in an ear,

350
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,105
to manage things from behind the scenes.

351
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:35,642
Maybe, but not me. Not with Archie.

352
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:39,112
You're right.

353
00:18:40,716 --> 00:18:44,084
You're right to protect your
relationship with Archie.

354
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:49,022
We gotta get aggressive, Kev.

355
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:50,664
Chic's turning down a lot of money

356
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,726
because he's refusing
to take a blood test.

357
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:54,461
And we need to find out why.

358
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:56,196
What exactly is hishiding?

359
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:59,165
What am I supposed to do? Just ask him?

360
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:02,202
I have a plan.

361
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:04,107
It's slightly insane.

362
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:08,775
Hey, stranger.

363
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:10,577
Been missing your cute face.

364
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:12,545
Where'd you go?

365
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:17,217
Uh, yeah, sorry. I
went MIA. I actually...

366
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,182
Just got tested for
the first time and...

367
00:19:22,185 --> 00:19:25,290
I'm negative but it's
been pretty intense.

368
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:27,627
Your first test? Congrats, cowboy.

369
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:30,166
- That's a milestone.
- Hmm.

370
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,832
Uh, do you get tested?

371
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:34,729
Yeah, I used to go every week.

372
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:36,970
Man, I had the worse scare once!

373
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:39,906
Oh, yeah? What happened?

374
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:42,575
Yeah, it's a long story but, uh...

375
00:19:42,578 --> 00:19:45,452
I was living with a
rougher crew than I am now.

376
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:52,852
Wait, are you talking to somebody else?

377
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,357
Uh...

378
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,858
That's it, that's it. I'm out!

379
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,591
No! What do you mean, Kev?

380
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:03,463
Sorry, Betty, but your brother
actually seems like a really good guy

381
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:05,565
and this is starting to make
me feel like a really bad person

382
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,167
so sorry, but I'm done.

383
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,739
Well?

384
00:20:12,742 --> 00:20:14,774
Did Pops confirm Mr.
Lodge bought the diner?

385
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:16,810
Yeah, he did.

386
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:19,482
But I'm sorry, I can't
publish that article, Archie.

387
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,141
It would break Pop's heart.

388
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,651
Jug, we can't give up. I
think my dad's gonna run.

389
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:27,587
Archie, I have talked
to every possible suspect

390
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,647
connected to the
Lodges, even Mayor McCoy.

391
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,147
They're all on lockdown.

392
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,482
Maybe you've been talking
to the wrong McCoy.

393
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:36,364
I'm brunching, Archie. What do you want?

394
00:20:37,263 --> 00:20:40,567
My dad is seconds away from running
for mayor with the Lodges' support.

395
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,902
And I don't him to go
through what your mom did.

396
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:46,208
So I was thinking maybe you
could get your mom to talk to him.

397
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,419
Even secretly.

398
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:50,232
Archie, my mom barely made it
out of the mayor's office alive.

399
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,544
If she lets slip even a whisper

400
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:55,915
of what went down between
her and the Lodges,

401
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:57,417
there'd be hell to pay.

402
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:00,286
She'd implicate herself
in about a million ways.

403
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:01,513
Yeah, I figured.

404
00:21:01,516 --> 00:21:04,424
But isn't there plenty of stuff
your mom could say to my dad

405
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:07,427
that would kill his buzz without
getting into the shady stuff?

406
00:21:09,138 --> 00:21:13,685
It's not all ribbon ceremonies
and catered affairs, Fred.

407
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:17,737
It's filling potholes, collecting trash,

408
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,940
and if you think you can run this town

409
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:24,143
plus Andrews Construction
at the same time, forget it.

410
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:26,279
I've got a pretty good
team working for me.

411
00:21:26,281 --> 00:21:29,900
And then there are the
uglier aspects of the job.

412
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:33,586
Crime, poverty, threats...

413
00:21:33,588 --> 00:21:35,463
Like the Black Hood?

414
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:39,729
Right now, you might be the
people's shining hope of Riverdale,

415
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,128
but say you do win, Fred.

416
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,732
They'll turn their back on you,

417
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,239
and all your friends

418
00:21:46,242 --> 00:21:49,580
will be standing in line
to stab you in the back.

419
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,771
I appreciate the real talk, Sierra.

420
00:21:51,774 --> 00:21:53,950
I haven't even gotten to
the real talk yet, Fred.

421
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:57,221
Let's chat about the pittance
that is the mayor's salary.

422
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:04,817
I know.

423
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:10,757
Oh. Hello.

424
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,326
Mom! I'm late for
work, can you drive me?

425
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:16,496
Not right now, Chic, I'm with
the twins. Take the bus or walk.

426
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:18,935
Oh, hi.

427
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,400
Pop Tate, to what do I owe this honor?

428
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:33,379
Sorry to bother you at home, Mr. Lodge.

429
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:35,915
Come on in.

430
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:41,554
Apparently, Jughead Jones

431
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:44,430
is asking questions about the
ownership of the Chock'lit Shoppe.

432
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:47,093
- Jughead Jones!
- Daddy!

433
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:48,995
Did Pop Tate keep his mouth shut?

434
00:22:48,997 --> 00:22:51,130
- More or less.
- Then Jughead has nothing.

435
00:22:51,132 --> 00:22:55,068
No, what he has is someone from our
inner circle feeding him information.

436
00:22:55,077 --> 00:22:58,912
Now, the only people that know that
we own Pop's are the three of us.

437
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:02,172
And Archie Andrews.

438
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:05,044
And yes, he's proven his
loyalty to us, but what's to say

439
00:23:05,046 --> 00:23:07,146
he isn't feeding information
to his best pal, Jug.

440
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:08,481
It was me.

441
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:11,812
I told Jughead about Pop's.

442
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:12,914
- What?
- Why?

443
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:14,520
When we were all at Shadow Lake,

444
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:17,123
Jughead was grilling
me about the Southside,

445
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:20,126
asking incessant questions about SoDale,

446
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:23,447
the trailer park, Southside High.
I had to get him off the scent,

447
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,411
so I distracted him with the
smallest truth I could, the diner.

448
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:29,068
Veronica, so help me, that is a...

449
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,205
- That was quick thinking, mija.
- What?

450
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,308
You can't possibly think
that was a prudent choice.

451
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,643
I do.

452
00:23:36,646 --> 00:23:40,213
Veronica wisely threw the dog a
little, relatively harmless bone

453
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:43,549
to keep him from digging up a much
bigger, more controversial one.

454
00:23:43,551 --> 00:23:45,218
Yes, exactly.

455
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,288
Her gambit bought us the time we need
for some preemptive damage control.

456
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:52,825
Ojala, you two are right.

457
00:23:54,195 --> 00:23:56,029
Hiram's gonna beat the clock.

458
00:23:56,031 --> 00:23:59,932
Feels like every step I make,
he's two or ten steps ahead of me.

459
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:01,622
He's lapping me!

460
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,270
He's been winning at this game a
lot longer than you've been alive.

461
00:24:04,272 --> 00:24:06,005
Yeah, because he's been rigging the game

462
00:24:06,014 --> 00:24:09,015
and everyone's too afraid to
come out and speak against him.

463
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:13,146
You know, uh...

464
00:24:13,148 --> 00:24:15,448
There's one person you haven't asked

465
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,517
to go on the record yet.

466
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,719
Who?

467
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:21,888
Me.

468
00:24:23,658 --> 00:24:26,192
You know, back in the day,
Hiram asked me and the Serpents

469
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:29,762
to trash the drive-in so he could
buy it for rock-bottom price.

470
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:32,698
We complied.

471
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:37,535
On purpose?

472
00:24:37,538 --> 00:24:39,605
You worked for Hiram Lodge?

473
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,317
I'll own up to that.

474
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,476
On the record, if it'll
help you bring him down.

475
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,150
- Hello?
- Jughead Jones?

476
00:24:51,152 --> 00:24:54,053
I have information about
Hiram Lodge's plans.

477
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:56,880
Riverdale bus terminal. 20 minutes.

478
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,869
Who was that?

479
00:25:00,872 --> 00:25:02,595
I have no idea.

480
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:06,532
But you may not have to
go on the record just yet.

481
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:25,548
I'm gonna kill you.

482
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:28,293
You're leaking private
information about my family.

483
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:30,228
Information that my
father trusted you with.

484
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,463
- Look, if this is about Pop's...
- Damn right it is!

485
00:25:32,465 --> 00:25:34,165
And lucky for you, I fell on the sword

486
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:36,100
and saved you from
his apocalyptic wrath.

487
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,202
- You didn't have to that.
- Yes, I did.

488
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:41,439
If my dad ever found out you snitched,

489
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:43,141
do you know what he would do to you?

490
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:46,411
Veronica, I'm not gonna apologize
to you for trying to protect my dad!

491
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:48,079
From my parents?

492
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:50,912
Archie, this isn't The
Manchurian Candidate.

493
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:53,451
And your father is an untouchable.

494
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:56,092
He'll never be hurt or corrupted.

495
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:58,303
What happened to your loyalty?

496
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,592
We brought you into this because
you said you were fine with it.

497
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:03,394
- You made a promise!
- Veronica, you wanted

498
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,897
my eyes wide open before
I committed to your family.

499
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,398
You insisted upon it, in fact.

500
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,901
And if my dad is gonna run
for mayor with your parents,

501
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:12,103
he deserves to know the
whole truth and so do I.

502
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:13,237
What whole truth?

503
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,440
His big secret plan for the Southside.

504
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:18,676
You were almost gonna tell me at
your confirmation but I stopped you.

505
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:21,245
Well, now, I wanna know.

506
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,347
For myself and for my dad.

507
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:27,525
That's... That's something you'll
have to talk to my dad about.

508
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:28,728
Oh, hey, there you are.

509
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:30,955
- Hey, Veronica.
- Hi, Mr. Andrews.

510
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,491
Perfect timing. Uh, I have
an announcement to make.

511
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:38,029
You two are looking at the next
candidate for mayor of Riverdale.

512
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,966
Guess you better talk to my dad fast.

513
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:18,136
Wasn't better when it
was just me, you and Mom?

514
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:21,139
Uh... You... You don't like Polly?

515
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,840
Love is finite.

516
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:25,943
People run out of it eventually.

517
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,981
They stop loving you or they
start loving someone else.

518
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:32,250
One day, the sun is shining down on you,

519
00:27:32,252 --> 00:27:34,585
and the next, you're alone.

520
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:36,354
And it's cold.

521
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,423
And dark.

522
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:41,059
Chic...

523
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,893
Are you okay?

524
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:48,066
Don't use my bathroom again, Betty.

525
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:27,872
I haven't much time.

526
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,537
Are you Deep Throat?

527
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,763
You've been calling everyone in town for

528
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:34,042
information about
Hiram Lodge but not me.

529
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:36,881
That's why I called you.

530
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,739
No offense, but how does a bus driver

531
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:43,514
have insider information on Hiram Lodge?

532
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,956
I used to be someone else,

533
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:53,518
someone who was privy to
Hiram Lodge's personal affairs.

534
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:57,435
Someone who suffered at his whims.

535
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:59,925
What kind of personal affairs?

536
00:28:59,928 --> 00:29:02,737
I coordinated
transportation for Mr. Lodge,

537
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,217
sometimes out to Shankshaw Prison.

538
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:10,181
He also received mail
from the warden there.

539
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:12,084
Shankshaw?

540
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:14,352
That's not where Hiram
Lodge served time.

541
00:29:14,354 --> 00:29:15,820
I'm afraid that's all I have for you.

542
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:17,904
That's it?

543
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:20,758
And one more thing. A question.

544
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:24,829
Miss Veronica, how's she
faring through all this?

545
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:30,807
So, Mr. Blossom, how does it feel being

546
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,287
back in Riverdale after all these years?

547
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,773
Ignore that person, Claudius.

548
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:38,276
I'd assumed tonight
would be family only.

549
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,645
It's all right. I enjoy
meeting new people.

550
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:42,813
Do you know, during my
journeys as a sailor,

551
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:46,384
I came upon the most wonderful island...

552
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,521
- Lesbos.
- Oh, my God.

553
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:54,859
It is the most beautiful
natural place on Earth.

554
00:29:54,861 --> 00:30:00,164
Oh, you're not going back on
the boat, dear boy, are you?

555
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,633
You're staying here with us.

556
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:05,169
Whatever I can do to make
sure that you and this house

557
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:07,171
are well cared for, Mother.

558
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:10,741
That is, of course,
as long as I'm welcome.

559
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:20,751
There's a room over the garage.

560
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:23,861
It's freezing in winter
and boiling in summer but...

561
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,263
It's there.

562
00:30:27,757 --> 00:30:30,245
So, Hiram Lodge's
master plan has something

563
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:32,962
to do with your old
stomping ground, Shankshaw.

564
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,101
I tried calling the warden a dozen
times but he hasn't called me back.

565
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:38,536
That corrupt son of a bitch.

566
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:41,098
Do you have any contacts on the
inside that might know something?

567
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:44,175
Yeah, War Baby.

568
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:46,008
He knows everybody's business.

569
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,410
Can I get in to see him?

570
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,453
Can I just say, between
us, that Chic is creepy?

571
00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:58,829
I don't think he likes me and I
don't think that he likes the twins.

572
00:30:58,832 --> 00:31:01,025
A couple of times I've just
caught him, like, staring at us.

573
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,526
Yeah, tell me about it.

574
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,595
It's part of the reason
why I submitted a sample

575
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:07,431
of Chic's blood to the lab
that the Blossoms set up.

576
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,433
- CSI Nancy Drew!
- Yeah.

577
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:11,402
How did you get a sample of his blood?

578
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,005
Don't worry about it.

579
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:16,474
But Polly, I think that Dad may be right

580
00:31:16,476 --> 00:31:20,845
that Chic's dangerous,
possibly not even our brother.

581
00:31:20,848 --> 00:31:22,680
Well, what do we do if he's not?

582
00:31:22,682 --> 00:31:25,316
Well, it'll crush Mom but
we'll have to tell her.

583
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:29,353
In a way, it may kind of be a relief.

584
00:31:33,946 --> 00:31:35,693
Hey, you're home.

585
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:39,697
Yeah, Polly just spent her Blossom
inheritance on silk headbands.

586
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,219
Betty, keep your voice down.

587
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:44,008
However Mom got Juniper
and Dagwood to sleep,

588
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:45,503
I do not want them waking up.

589
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:47,786
- Oh, no, the twins, they're not home.
- What do you mean?

590
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:50,308
- Where are they?
- They're with Chic.

591
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,555
He wanted to take his niece and nephew

592
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:56,182
for a walk along Sweetwater River.

593
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,983
Why? Is there something wrong?

594
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,618
Mom, are you serious?

595
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,954
How could you let a complete
stranger take my babies?

596
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,756
He's not a stranger. He's your brother

597
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,545
and he's doing something nice for you.

598
00:32:07,548 --> 00:32:09,610
Yeah, the hell he is!

599
00:32:11,898 --> 00:32:13,597
What did you do to my babies?

600
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,068
Nothing, Polly. They're fine.

601
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:29,446
What's up, Jonesy? You want me to
knock some heads in here for ya?

602
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:32,063
No, War Baby, we need intel.

603
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:35,252
You heard about anything major
going on behind the scenes?

604
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:37,455
Maybe to do with a guy named Hiram?

605
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,390
Hiram Lodge?

606
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:41,258
You're like Dracula.

607
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:43,527
He bought property all over London

608
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:46,630
so he could move his vampire
kingdom over from Transylvania.

609
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,500
Except you're bringing
organized crime to Riverdale.

610
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:53,504
And you want my dad to be mayor
so he can be your patsy, except...

611
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:56,207
What if you and him don't
see eye to eye on something?

612
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:58,409
What an imagination you have.

613
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:02,279
- What do you have there?
- This is my journal.

614
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:05,282
When Mrs. Lodge sent that
fake FBI agent to test me,

615
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:07,612
I started taking detailed
notes of everything

616
00:33:07,615 --> 00:33:09,687
I saw while I was apprenticing with you.

617
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:12,664
- Is that a threat?
- I'm looking out for my family.

618
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,326
Archie...

619
00:33:18,243 --> 00:33:21,024
I believe your father and
I will make a great team.

620
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:23,266
Moreover, in 18 months,

621
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:26,270
Lodge Industries will
be 100 percent legitimate

622
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,806
and Riverdale will be
virtually crime-free.

623
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:31,575
The safest small town in America.

624
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:33,511
How are you gonna do that?

625
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,479
Or am I not inner circle enough to know?

626
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,681
Everything will become clear very soon.

627
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,417
I'm just asking for you to trust me.

628
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:42,153
Forget about me. This is my dad
we're talking about, Mr. Lodge.

629
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:45,623
We will all benefit from
this, Archie. I promise.

630
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,978
I'll hold you to that.

631
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:57,368
And in the meantime,
I'll keep this very close.

632
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:12,963
- Where's Betty?
- With Jughead.

633
00:34:12,965 --> 00:34:15,432
- Why do you ask, Polly?
- I...

634
00:34:16,535 --> 00:34:19,569
I... I'm going, Mom.

635
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,413
Chic said it would only be a matter of

636
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:25,241
time before you left
us for the farm again.

637
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:26,977
I'm not going to the farm, Mom.

638
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,512
I'm driving west, San Francisco, maybe.

639
00:34:29,514 --> 00:34:32,297
It's a nice city,
Polly. I've been there.

640
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,517
It's safe too. Safe for the kids.

641
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:39,723
Will you at least let me say
goodbye to my grand-twins?

642
00:34:39,725 --> 00:34:41,358
Of course.

643
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:46,863
Drop us a note with your new
address when you get there.

644
00:34:46,866 --> 00:34:48,132
Okay?

645
00:35:03,441 --> 00:35:04,681
Hey.

646
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:09,527
What's wrong?

647
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,379
We just got a call from our good friend

648
00:35:11,382 --> 00:35:13,089
Warden Jeffries at Shankshaw Prison.

649
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:16,626
Seems that Jughead and FP Jones
paid a visit to one of FP's cronies.

650
00:35:16,628 --> 00:35:19,863
A well-informed, loose-lipped crony.

651
00:35:19,865 --> 00:35:22,432
We think they know, Daddy.
Think they know everything.

652
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:23,967
Which means it's just a matter of time

653
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:27,070
before Jughead splashes it on
the front page of a newspaper.

654
00:35:27,073 --> 00:35:28,829
One we do not own.

655
00:35:28,832 --> 00:35:31,241
Get Fred and Archie over here now.

656
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:35,612
Hiram Lodge is diabolically insane.

657
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:39,723
Agreed. We need to show
Riverdale just how insane he is.

658
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,352
This is the best thing
you've ever written, Jug.

659
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:48,892
Principal Weatherbee needs to
publish this right the hell now.

660
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:50,227
Let's go.

661
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,696
Jughead Jones may be
about to break a story.

662
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:56,933
A story about my plans for Riverdale.

663
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:59,035
And rather than hear it from him,

664
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:01,004
I think it's only right
that you hear it from me.

665
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:03,136
This is quite a story, Mr. Jones.

666
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:04,425
Thank you, Principal Weatherbee.

667
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,316
Unfortunately, it's not one
that the Blue and Gold can print.

668
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:08,585
Why the heck not?

669
00:36:08,588 --> 00:36:10,913
A malicious take-down of
one of our students' parents

670
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:13,750
is not the appropriate subject
matter for a school paper.

671
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:15,785
Now, if you'll both excuse me.

672
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:23,093
You're serious? Southside
High is gonna be turned into...

673
00:36:23,095 --> 00:36:25,795
A private, for-profit prison.

674
00:36:25,798 --> 00:36:29,165
Yeah, built on the
bones of a high school.

675
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:31,000
What the hell have we
been building in SoDale?

676
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:33,347
What we've said all along. Housing.

677
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,638
For all the people who
will work at the prison.

678
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,241
And you expect me to
support this as mayor?

679
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:40,243
We're hoping you'd be open to it.

680
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:41,478
Yes.

681
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:45,314
- Can't do it. I'm outta here.
- Look, Fred...

682
00:36:45,317 --> 00:36:47,617
We've been in business for how
long? And you didn't tell me.

683
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:48,985
And the only reason
you're telling me now

684
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:50,553
is because it's getting
ready to become public.

685
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:52,113
I'll admit, it's not ideal.

686
00:36:52,116 --> 00:36:53,556
"Not ideal," Hiram?

687
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:55,758
You wanna turn the town
that I love, my home,

688
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,962
my son's home, into a prison.

689
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:03,600
Fred, please let me tell you why and how

690
00:37:03,602 --> 00:37:06,102
this is the right move,
for us, for Riverdale.

691
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:08,972
You just save that for whoever it
is that you find to run for mayor

692
00:37:08,974 --> 00:37:11,975
because we are leaving
and we are leaving now.

693
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:13,657
Come on, Archie.

694
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,377
Dad, I'm gonna stay.

695
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,282
Excuse me?

696
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:21,684
I wanna stay. I wanna hear
what Mr. Lodge has to say.

697
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:26,789
Then I will see you at home then.

698
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:49,302
Thank you all for coming.

699
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:54,043
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

700
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:56,573
your next mayor of Riverdale,

701
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,909
my mother, Hermoine Lodge.

702
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,769
Thank you, Veronica, and
thank you all very much.

703
00:38:09,772 --> 00:38:13,323
Like many of you, I grew up in this town

704
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:15,658
dreaming of a better tomorrow.

705
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,362
For myself, for my
family and for my friends.

706
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,691
And now,

707
00:38:22,694 --> 00:38:26,402
for the future that you all so deserve.

708
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:32,475
Riverdale is one of the most
dynamic, resilient communities...

709
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:37,180
The Lodges. How often have I dreamt
of getting my revenge on them.

710
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:40,884
Now, now, Claudius. First things first.

711
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,321
Nana... Then Cheryl.

712
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,190
Of course, Penelope.

713
00:38:47,193 --> 00:38:49,325
Our house must be put in order.

714
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:53,062
Riverdale cannot succeed
unless all of us succeed

715
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,225
and that will require
certain sacrifices.

716
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:02,113
What... What is this?

717
00:39:02,116 --> 00:39:05,208
When you wouldn't
submit to the DNA test,

718
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,177
I found some of your dental
floss and sent it to the lab.

719
00:39:08,675 --> 00:39:10,441
Those are the results.

720
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:15,660
You're not who you say you are, Chic.

721
00:39:15,663 --> 00:39:18,621
So, who are you?

722
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:20,900
We will also need your support.

723
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:24,608
We will need your trust.
We will need your loyalty.

724
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:27,210
I knew a prison would
be a difficult sell.

725
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:30,967
Especially with Fred.

726
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,836
I was gonna ease him into the idea.

727
00:39:35,048 --> 00:39:37,581
And clearly, I should
have told you both sooner.

728
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:39,771
I regret that.

729
00:39:39,774 --> 00:39:41,964
To be honest, Mr. Lodge,

730
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:45,014
before Jason, before the Black Hood,

731
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,850
before my dad was shot,

732
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:51,554
I might not have understood
your point of view.

733
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:56,993
But I've changed and I think
Riverdale needs a change too.

734
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:03,069
This tradition has

735
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:07,342
been in my family,
going back generations.

736
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:08,777
It's a...

737
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:11,874
sign of loyalty.

738
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:14,085
Once you do this,

739
00:40:14,088 --> 00:40:15,835
there's no undoing it.

740
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,448
No changing your mind.

741
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,151
So are you certain?

742
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,787
I think...

743
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,425
I am.

744
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,056
You know what you need to do.

745
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,706
Now, Archie...

746
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:20,843
We come first.

747
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:27,545
This town has endured so
much these past few years.

748
00:41:27,548 --> 00:41:30,100
After so much adversity,

749
00:41:30,103 --> 00:41:35,024
aren't we all ready for
a taste of prosperity?

750
00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:43,028
And there it was. The Lodges had won.

751
00:41:43,031 --> 00:41:46,002
Time had run out for Riverdale.

752
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:50,675
