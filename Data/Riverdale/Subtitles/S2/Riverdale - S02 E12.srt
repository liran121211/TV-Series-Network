1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,100
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:03,102 --> 00:00:05,669
How many times are we
gonna push each other away?

3
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:09,706
I know about the webcam-ing.

4
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,408
Can you show me how to do that?

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,478
Serpent law says you
can't hurt one of your own.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,812
No! No!

7
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:17,681
How did the Uktena
evolve into the Serpents?

8
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:21,174
We didn't evolve, we were all
slaughtered by General Pickens.

9
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:23,915
You interviewed my grandfather
for a history report,

10
00:00:23,918 --> 00:00:26,706
not some half-assed newspaper article.

11
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,759
I think we can all be
proud to live in a Riverdale

12
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:32,195
where young people stand up for justice.

13
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:34,393
Let me tell you something
about Veronica's parents

14
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:35,827
and the way they do business.

15
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,729
Isn't this something
the Serpents would do?

16
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:40,604
As long as you're dating Veronica,

17
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:42,206
I'm going to demand the best from you.

18
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,206
How would you like to
start your business tutelage

19
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:45,409
under my shepherding?

20
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,148
It's a classic trope of mob movies.

21
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,307
Rich, high-rolling gangster
takes small town kid

22
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,742
under his wing.

23
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:57,432
- Here you go, Archie.
- Thanks, Pop.

24
00:00:57,435 --> 00:00:59,057
Small town kid

25
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,490
is ushered into an intoxicating

26
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:03,480
but dangerous life of crime.

27
00:01:03,483 --> 00:01:05,462
No, Poppa, you don't need to travel

28
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:06,530
with your own chef,

29
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:08,979
we have excellent poutine
right here in Riverdale.

30
00:01:08,982 --> 00:01:11,613
Because I've tasted it and it's superb.

31
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,924
Hey, run this to your dad's trailer?

32
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:16,174
And then pick up some loafers

33
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,007
I had resoled at the
Shoe Doctor on Main.

34
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,643
Happy to, Mr. Lodge.

35
00:01:23,038 --> 00:01:25,049
- There he is.
- Sorry, Dad.

36
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,919
Sorry, guys. Mr. Lodge has
me running all over town.

37
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,047
Stick around. I've got the truck.

38
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,841
I'll give you a ride home.
I'm done here in 20 minutes.

39
00:01:29,843 --> 00:01:30,590
I've got my bike.

40
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:32,713
And I still gotta pick up
his shoes, but I'll see you.

41
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:43,676
Ronnie...

42
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:45,301
That hem's high enough, Terry.

43
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:47,237
It's a confirmation, not a sock-hop.

44
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,186
Usually, it happens
when you're 12 or 13,

45
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:52,422
but my parents wanted

46
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:54,525
the same monsignor who baptized me.

47
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,495
Monsignor Murphy, he's
a friend of the family,

48
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:57,847
to confirm me, as well.

49
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,716
Wow, so this is a big deal, then?

50
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:02,686
It is. Especially to my mom and dad.

51
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:04,721
And, well, my whole family.

52
00:02:04,723 --> 00:02:06,556
A lot of them are coming in for it.

53
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,443
So, do you have to... memorize stuff?

54
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:14,053
During the ceremony, Monsignor
will ask me to renounce Satan,

55
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:15,332
which, of course I will.

56
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:18,537
But otherwise, you mostly
do things in advance.

57
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,279
Like picking a sponsor.
I asked my abuelita.

58
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:23,264
And performing charitable works.

59
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:24,908
I'm volunteering at a soup kitchen,

60
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,045
if you'd care to join me.

61
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:27,381
There she is.

62
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:29,279
Let me take a look at you

63
00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:33,550
My beautiful daughter, confirmed

64
00:02:33,552 --> 00:02:36,152
in front of my family... Our family.

65
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:38,555
Oh, mija, you've made me the happiest

66
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,157
and the proudest father alive.

67
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:45,235
What do you think, Archie?

68
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:46,604
Isn't she a miracle?

69
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,706
She is.

70
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,108
She definitely is.

71
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:58,775
Sheriff Keller, what a surprise.

72
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:00,844
Jughead. FP.

73
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,561
Sorry to bother you. It's...

74
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:05,022
We don't have General Pickens' head,

75
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:07,082
and we do not know who stole it.

76
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,355
Same as the last four times

77
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:10,098
you came by to ask us and our neighbors.

78
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:11,734
You know, Sheriff, these visits

79
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:13,693
are starting to feel
a lot like harassment.

80
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:16,006
There's absolutely no evidence.

81
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:18,343
Zero proof whatsoever

82
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:21,096
pointing to any particular
group of suspects.

83
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,700
Well, you did write a
rather scathing article

84
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:25,035
about the General's legacy,

85
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:27,570
which prompted the
Southside Serpents to stop by

86
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:29,639
at Pickens' Day with an ax to grind.

87
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:31,498
I'm actually writing a new article

88
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,702
about how you seem to care more about

89
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:36,072
catching a vandal than the Black Hood.

90
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:37,733
Can I get a quote?

91
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:46,189
Do I look good?

92
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:49,225
- Mmm-hmm.
- Can I undress for you?

93
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:50,527
Yeah.

94
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,096
I love talking to you.

95
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:54,998
I like talking to you too.

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,592
- Can we meet sometime?
- Maybe.

97
00:03:58,634 --> 00:03:59,933
Betty?

98
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:01,204
What's going on in there?

99
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:02,639
Why is the door locked?

100
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:05,976
You know how I feel about locked doors.

101
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:10,509
Yeah, you're the one who
likes to do the locking.

102
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:12,169
I heard voices. Who were you talking to?

103
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:14,542
Jughead. He had some
questions about homework.

104
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,719
Now can I finish
getting dressed, please?

105
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,616
Well, I...

106
00:04:18,828 --> 00:04:20,190
I already invited Archie,

107
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,192
but I want you guys
to be there, as well.

108
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:24,027
Usually these kinds of events,

109
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:27,464
baptisms, confirmations
are family-only,

110
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,232
but since it's all about me

111
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:31,006
and you guys are my chosen family,

112
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:33,643
I pulled a few strings
and reserved you a pew.

113
00:04:33,646 --> 00:04:35,464
What is the dress code?

114
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:39,342
Catholic chic. So, dresses
for the girls, veils optional.

115
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:40,944
And coats and ties for the boys.

116
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,779
Jughead Jones and Betty Cooper,

117
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,015
please report to the principal's office.

118
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,146
Jughead Jones and Betty Cooper
to the principal's office.

119
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,821
Since your article
attacking General Pickens

120
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:54,073
among others has come out,

121
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,959
it's been a steady stream of outrage.

122
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,686
Most recently,

123
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,322
Hiram Lodge's lawyer,

124
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:02,842
a Mr. Sowerberry has called

125
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,387
saying his client's considering

126
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,998
legal action against the Blue and Gold.

127
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,098
On what grounds?

128
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:09,990
Defamation of character, Mr. Jones.

129
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:11,693
Effective immediately,

130
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:14,396
you are both suspended
from the newspaper's staff.

131
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,764
You have the day to clean
out your personal things.

132
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:20,627
I'm so sorry, Betty.

133
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,139
I don't care if they harass me at home

134
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:24,909
or school, but you...

135
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:26,920
You don't deserve this heat.

136
00:05:26,923 --> 00:05:28,756
Who's harassing you at home?

137
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,982
Sheriff Keller. He has no proof,

138
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:33,363
but he suspects one or
more of the Serpents,

139
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:37,233
probably me, decapitated the
statue of General Pickens.

140
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,537
And dd you?

141
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,091
Betty, how...

142
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:43,862
Why would I decapitate a bronze statue?

143
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:46,509
Maybe the same reason
you wrote that article.

144
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:48,826
To avenge Toni's grandfather.

145
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:53,107
I mean, you and Toni are close.

146
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,975
Sure.

147
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,012
- We're pals.
- Close pals.

148
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,457
I saw you guys at Pop's

149
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,192
early one morning,

150
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:05,873
in the middle of the Black Hood attacks.

151
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:07,873
You were having breakfast,

152
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:11,225
and you seemed like more than pals.

153
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:13,451
And I know it's not my place to ask,

154
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:17,378
but did anything ever
happen between you two?

155
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:21,331
Yeah.

156
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:23,947
The night of the Gauntlet,

157
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:26,753
after you sent Archie
to break up with me,

158
00:06:26,756 --> 00:06:29,119
Toni stayed over.

159
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,553
She gave me a...

160
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:35,386
Tattoo.

161
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:39,842
And we did some stuff,
but not everything.

162
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:41,311
Uh-huh.

163
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:43,625
But since you brought it up,

164
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:47,311
have you done anything with
anyone since we broke up?

165
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:48,513
No.

166
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:50,527
No.

167
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,944
Of course not.

168
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:58,623
Ooh-la-la!

169
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:02,287
- Is that for me?
- It is.

170
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,951
It's'confirmation present

171
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:05,787
from the St. Clairs, of all people.

172
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,424
Why would they think they
have the right to do that

173
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,271
after everything that
went down between us?

174
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:12,623
It's what families in our business do.

175
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:16,061
Even when we're at war, we give gifts.

176
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:17,561
To show respect.

177
00:07:17,564 --> 00:07:20,115
Or, in this case, to
try and make amends.

178
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:23,620
Well, whatever it is, feel
free to burn or regift it.

179
00:07:25,397 --> 00:07:26,897
Veronica...

180
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,736
Simone St. Clair called
to follow up on this gift.

181
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:36,451
She said that Archie paid
Nick an unfriendly visit.

182
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:37,920
Is that true?

183
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:41,211
Sorry to keep making you
double-check everything, Pop.

184
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:42,681
It's more to make sure I got it right.

185
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:44,663
Mr. Lodge's special orders
can get pretty complicated.

186
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:45,898
No problem, Archie.

187
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:47,693
After all, he's the boss.

188
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,075
What do you mean by that, Pop?

189
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,672
Crap!

190
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:58,942
You cannot just show up
at my house like this.

191
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:00,943
I haven't heard from you in a while.

192
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:02,420
I've been calling and texting.

193
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:03,856
There's been nothing to report.

194
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,892
You don't think your
girlfriend's confirmation

195
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:07,092
is worth a mention?

196
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:08,728
No, why would it be?

197
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:09,897
Our sources are telling us

198
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,764
Hiram Lodge's family is coming to it.

199
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:16,558
And by that, I mean his crime family.

200
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:19,521
I need you to be my eyes and
ears at that event, Archie.

201
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:20,923
What?

202
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:22,043
Is there a problem?

203
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:23,479
It's my girlfriend's confirmation.

204
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:24,975
It's a big deal to her.

205
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:27,936
I want to be there for
Veronica, not the FBI.

206
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:30,311
Unfortunately, Archie,

207
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:32,467
you'll have to be there for us both.

208
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:40,014
Sheriff Keller,

209
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:42,117
we have to stop meeting like this.

210
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,552
Where's your dad at?

211
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,555
Had a shift at Pop's. Why?

212
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,740
It's an eviction notice.

213
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:50,529
You, your dad, pretty much
everyone in this place,

214
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:51,732
you all got to clear out.

215
00:08:51,735 --> 00:08:52,934
What?

216
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:55,304
Don't tell me this is
because of that statue?

217
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:57,584
For the millionth time, Sheriff,

218
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:59,943
we did not decapitate General Pickens.

219
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:02,313
And you can't use that
as some trumped-up excuse

220
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:03,896
to try and evict all of us.

221
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,381
Look, I'm just the messenger, all right?

222
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:08,351
This order comes down
from the mayor's Office.

223
00:09:08,354 --> 00:09:10,826
Apparently, there's a lot
of back rent owed here.

224
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:12,990
You have 14 days to vacate.

225
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:14,771
Then perhaps while you're packing,

226
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:16,541
you might come across that head.

227
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:17,889
Calm the waters a little.

228
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,373

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

229
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,918
Sierra and Josie are here to...

230
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,905
Offer an apology after Pickens Day.

231
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,886
I had misgivings

232
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:41,589
about some of the decisions
your parents were making.

233
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:44,176
That was wrong and inappropriate.

234
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:47,094
Oh, these are stressful times, Sierra.

235
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:50,431
And neither Veronica
nor I hold any grudges.

236
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:51,699
Not at all.

237
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:53,334
In fact, I would love it

238
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:55,636
if you'd both come to my confirmation.

239
00:09:56,873 --> 00:10:00,774
Veronica, Hermione, we
accept your invitation.

240
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:03,327
That makes giving you
your gift that much easier.

241
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,577
Josie?

242
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:07,569
If you'll have me,

243
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:10,651
I'd be honored to sing at
your confirmation, Veronica.

244
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,620
- No, you don't have to
- That's a lovely idea, Josie,

245
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:14,488
- we accept.
- But, Mom, I was gonna sing.

246
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,507
Or we could do a duet.

247
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,061
Do you know "Bitter Sweet Symphony"

248
00:10:21,063 --> 00:10:23,139
from the Cruel Intentions soundtrack?

249
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:27,189
I can learn it.

250
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:34,875
We all got the eviction notices,

251
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:38,746
but I swear to you...
No one is goin' anywhere.

252
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:41,781
But the heat's been
on us since Pickens Day

253
00:10:41,784 --> 00:10:44,155
and they're using that damn statue

254
00:10:44,158 --> 00:10:46,353
as an excuse to turn it up.

255
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,391
But if we're gonna
fix this, I gotta ask:

256
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:53,326
Is anyone in this room responsible

257
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:55,162
for cutting off Pickens' head?

258
00:10:55,164 --> 00:10:56,964
Why don't you ask your son

259
00:10:56,966 --> 00:10:58,299
what he has to say?

260
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:00,366
What is your problem with me, Tall Boy?

261
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,170
You wrote the article
that started this mess.

262
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:05,606
You and your posse

263
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,308
fired the opening shot at Pickens Day.

264
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,143
It was a peaceful protest, Turncoat.

265
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:10,514
That accomplished nothing.

266
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:12,717
So what's to say that
you and your boyfriend

267
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,748
didn't go back that night
with a ladder and hacksaw

268
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,383
Hey! We didn't do it.

269
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,186
Hell, Tall Boy, you're the
tallest guy in this room.

270
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:20,468
You wouldn't even need a ladder.

271
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,855
Jughead... Tall Boy,

272
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:24,491
the last thing we need right now

273
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:25,960
is to turn on each other.

274
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:28,896
Hey... We'll find a way out of this.

275
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,535
I heard a rumor...

276
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:35,035
That you paid Nick St. Clair a visit.

277
00:11:35,038 --> 00:11:36,605
And roughed him up a bit.

278
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:40,102
Uh...

279
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:42,551
The thing is, Mr. Lodge, I...

280
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:45,546
When I found out about what
Nick tried to do with Veronica,

281
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:47,332
I just... I got

282
00:11:47,335 --> 00:11:48,749
so angry.

283
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,257
But still.

284
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,152
Beating up on a kid,

285
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:55,055
even a filthy animal like Nick St. Clair

286
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:57,147
while his legs are in casts...

287
00:11:59,562 --> 00:12:01,161
I'm...

288
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:03,397
Impressed.

289
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,543
No.

290
00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:09,603
I respect a man that
will go to such extremes

291
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,971
to send a message.

292
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:12,940
And I'm relieved that
Veronica has someone

293
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:15,242
so fiercely protective.

294
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:17,311
Of course, sir, always.

295
00:12:18,514 --> 00:12:20,814
I have some out-of-town
guests coming in

296
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:22,343
for Veronica's confirmation.

297
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:24,652
I'm hosting a poker game
at Pop's the night before.

298
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:27,287
I'll need a couple extra hands to help.

299
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,822
Someone I can trust.

300
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:31,172
You know... To keep the drinks filled

301
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:32,624
and the cigars cut.

302
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,328
Are you interested?

303
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:37,197
Absolutely.

304
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,299
Sir, I'll be there.

305
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,280
Chic? Is that you?

306
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,049
Uh... Who are you? Where's Chic?

307
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:56,917
I'm Ben, Chic will be right down.

308
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,485
See ya.

309
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:03,023
Hey, what's going on?

310
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,658
I thought you had a job interview today.

311
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,326
I did. That was Ben.

312
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,028
He works concessions at the Bijou.

313
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,764
Pretty sure I got the job.

314
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:12,296
Well, I thought he might've
been one of your clients.

315
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,535
Never... I'd never tell
those guys where I live.

316
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:16,770
And don't you do it either, ever.

317
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:18,238
- I wouldn't.
- Good.

318
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,375
Boundaries are key.
They'll keep you alive.

319
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:25,713
This witch-hunt has to end, Mayor.

320
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:27,915
The Serpents had nothing
to do with that beheading.

321
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,249
You know that and in the meantime,

322
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:30,551
you're gonna tighten the screws,

323
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:32,953
you'll send Sheriff Keller
to sow seeds of unrest,

324
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:34,621
threaten to take our homes away?

325
00:13:34,624 --> 00:13:37,202
Since when do you care about
the statue of a murderer?

326
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:40,526
Since Governor Dooley called
and read me the Riot Act.

327
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,396
That statue cost him a lot of money.

328
00:13:42,398 --> 00:13:43,564
He's furious.

329
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:46,730
And you're supposed to
be an ally, Mayor McCoy.

330
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,960
So why are you doing
this? Unless it's...

331
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:54,871
Who's pulling your strings?

332
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:57,745
Is it Hiram Lodge?

333
00:13:57,747 --> 00:13:59,213
You're a bright kid, Jughead.

334
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:00,714
I've always liked you.

335
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:03,884
So listen to what I'm telling you...

336
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:06,764
Back down!

337
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:17,231
What do you mean my dad
invited you to his poker game?

338
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:19,066
No, not to play, just to,

339
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:22,236
like, serve drinks and
bus tables and cut cigars.

340
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:24,872
- Whatever that means.
- But those games are private.

341
00:14:24,874 --> 00:14:26,740
Daddy's inner-inner-circle.

342
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:28,866
Well, I guess I'm in.

343
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,671
Unless there's a reason
why I shouldn't go?

344
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,270
Come here. Excuse me.

345
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:43,223
This floating poker game is
a long-standing tradition.

346
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:45,025
It's been happening for decades.

347
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:48,095
It's incredibly high stakes,
in every sense of the word.

348
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:50,163
You're going to have
to be extremely careful

349
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,647
around these other players.

350
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,567
Okay? I just don't want you to get hurt.

351
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:54,843
Why would I get hurt?

352
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:57,013
I thought these guys were
close friends and relatives?

353
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:59,850
They are, but they're like Daddy.

354
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:01,775
They're old school.

355
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,244
Industry titans you don't want to cross.

356
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:08,218
Just promise me, you'll play it safe.

357
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:10,184
Ronnie, I'm refilling water glasses,

358
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:12,252
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

359
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,561
Thank you for meeting with me.

360
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:22,563
You're the only person in this town

361
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:24,164
that I can talk to about
something like this.

362
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,966
Before you do, can I just

363
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,389
point out one thing?

364
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:29,250
I know what you're going to say.

365
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:31,672
Last time the Serpents
and I were in trouble,

366
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:33,246
I pushed you away.

367
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:35,542
What do you need, Jug?

368
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:37,845
Mayor McCoy thinks the
Serpents were the ones

369
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:40,113
who vandalized the
statue of General Pickens.

370
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:42,449
And now, suddenly, we have 14 days

371
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:44,218
to vacate Sunnyside Trailer Park.

372
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,253
What... That's illegal.

373
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:48,755
Technically, the trailer
park's on town property.

374
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:50,624
And not everyone has paid their rent.

375
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:52,392
Well, so, let's go talk to Mayor McCoy.

376
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:53,286
I did.

377
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,269
She's making this all
about the beheaded statue

378
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:56,629
and really it's just a pretense

379
00:15:56,632 --> 00:15:58,432
to shut us up and get us out.

380
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,200
If the statue's what's fueling her fire,

381
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:02,293
then let's take away the gas.

382
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:05,138
"The Case of the Decapitated Statue."

383
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,207
Let's treat it like a
missing persons case.

384
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:10,210
Someone, somewhere,
must've seen something.

385
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:12,746
So, we'll canvas the
town with reward flyers

386
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:14,335
for anyone who has information.

387
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:15,641
Finding that head and who did it

388
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:17,917
would really take the wind
out of Mayor McCoy's sails.

389
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,086
So...

390
00:16:19,088 --> 00:16:21,554
Find the head, save the trailer park.

391
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,461
You invited Archie to
work your Casino Royale?

392
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,229
Aren't you worried he's gonna find out

393
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:30,957
all our family secrets?

394
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,901
Business isn't discussed
when the family gathers

395
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:36,103
for such sacred celebrations
as your confirmation.

396
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:38,054
You always have an agenda, Daddy.

397
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:39,423
What is it this time?

398
00:16:39,426 --> 00:16:40,907
After hearing about how Archie

399
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,309
took initiative with Nick St. Clair,

400
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:44,645
I wanted to see how he'd handle himself

401
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:46,280
in a room of my peers.

402
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:47,655
Yes, but why?

403
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:48,782
He's your boyfriend, mija.

404
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:51,151
And if this relationship
of yours persists,

405
00:16:51,153 --> 00:16:52,552
at some point,

406
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:54,554
we may need to bring Archie in.

407
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:58,292
I thought outsiders weren't
brought in to the family.

408
00:16:58,294 --> 00:16:59,393
Not traditionally, no.

409
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:02,535
But Archie, he may be more like
us than I gave him credit for.

410
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:03,871
No, he's not.

411
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:07,501
And I'm not sure I want him

412
00:17:07,503 --> 00:17:09,836
to be... compromised.

413
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,130
I see.

414
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,547
But if things keep
going as they have been,

415
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,712
you're gonna have to make a decision.

416
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:21,048
Either we bring him in,

417
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,116
or he stays on the outside, forever.

418
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,753
All right, order of the Ophidians.

419
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:31,037
Jughead Jones.

420
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,362
Did you really think
you'd see the last of me?

421
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:37,277
What's the Snake Charmer doing here?

422
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,365
Dad?

423
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,964
No, I brought her in, to help us.

424
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,466
We don't need Penny's kind of help.

425
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,502
You don't get a say anymore.

426
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:47,708
Since you broke Serpent law
and hurt one of our own kind.

427
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,995
Penny was about to tell your dad.

428
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:51,678
Show him, Penny.

429
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,483
Show 'em all.

430
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:02,122
That used to be my Serpent tattoo,

431
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,742
until your son sliced
a chunk outta my arm

432
00:18:04,745 --> 00:18:07,294
and left me bleeding
in a ditch in Greendale.

433
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,698
But I'm still willing
to help the Serpents.

434
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:13,756
Tall Boy showed me
those eviction notices.

435
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,024
They're legit.

436
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:19,050
Luckily, I can think of about
41 ways to stall the process.

437
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:21,417
And I'm talking years.

438
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,977
What's your price, Penny?

439
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,633
Blood for blood.

440
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,613
An eye for an eye.

441
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:29,016
I want back in with the Serpents

442
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:30,751
and I want him kicked out.

443
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,034
Oh, yeah, one last thing...

444
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:38,656
I want his tattoo carved off.

445
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:41,450
And I want to do it myself.

446
00:18:42,698 --> 00:18:44,231
With a dirty knife.

447
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:55,669
Well? What did they say?
Are they kicking me out?

448
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:57,691
There's gonna be a vote.

449
00:18:57,694 --> 00:18:59,507
You versus Penny.

450
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:00,774
Me versus...

451
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:02,667
What, they can't see what we get?

452
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,869
With Penny in the picture?

453
00:19:03,872 --> 00:19:05,305
Penny's a cobra,

454
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:07,870
but mutilating her?

455
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:11,952
That's the kind of thing you
don't come back from, Jug.

456
00:19:11,955 --> 00:19:15,156
Yeah, like stuffing a
teenager's body in a freezer?

457
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,498
You need to learn to
keep your damn mouth shut.

458
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:19,560
Tall Boy was right.

459
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:21,228
You brought the Northside down on us.

460
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,898
Serpents are losing their
dens because of what you wrote.

461
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,066
Don't kid yourself.

462
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:29,992
You're using my article.

463
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:33,136
And they're using what happened
to the statue of General Pickens

464
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,939
as an excuse to justify something

465
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,241
they've already been doing.

466
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:37,777
You think you're a hero, Jug?

467
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:40,068
Cutting up women?

468
00:19:40,949 --> 00:19:43,751
Bringing the temple down
right on our damn heads?

469
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:49,557
You... will be the death of us.

470
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,688
Not the Northside, not Penny.

471
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:55,629
You.

472
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:02,067
Are you out of your freaking mind?

473
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,369
I'm not wearing a wire.

474
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:05,206
Archie, this poker game...

475
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:07,575
All the kingpins, together in one room.

476
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:10,311
We've never managed to
get anyone close enough

477
00:20:10,313 --> 00:20:12,947
to them to hear and
record what they discuss.

478
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:15,082
Okay, hear, yes. Record, no.

479
00:20:15,084 --> 00:20:16,750
You afraid we might capture something

480
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:18,452
that implicates your father?

481
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:19,653
Or Veronica?

482
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:21,322
I'm the one taking the risk here,

483
00:20:21,324 --> 00:20:23,063
Agent Adams, not you.

484
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:25,059
We're doing this on my terms.

485
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:26,328
No wire.

486
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:32,902
I told you, Alice,

487
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:34,995
either Chic goes or I go.

488
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:36,636
Chic isn't hurting anyone.

489
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,272
And he just got a job.
Where was it, Betty?

490
00:20:38,274 --> 00:20:39,722
- At the Bijou.
- At the Bijou.

491
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:41,993
And he's offered to pay rent.
So, what's your beef with him?

492
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:43,795
He's a stranger, that's my beef.

493
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:45,945
So? Make an effort. Get to know him.

494
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:47,314
Yeah, please, Dad.

495
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:48,878
Can you just try?

496
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,925
Why don't you guys
call me when he's gone?

497
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:51,834
In the meantime,

498
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:54,387
I'll be at a ShareBNB
down by the Register.

499
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,457
Fine, Hal, do what you want.

500
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,727
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

501
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,670
It's been some time
since my last confession.

502
00:21:10,873 --> 00:21:13,519
The Bible says gossiping's a sin.

503
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,117
If that's true... Guilty.

504
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,180
Also, I admit to being, on occasion,

505
00:21:20,183 --> 00:21:23,461
disrespectful to my parents.

506
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:26,220
But what I'm most worried about is...

507
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,157
That I'm doing something terrible

508
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,699
to a person I love.

509
00:21:35,264 --> 00:21:38,432
Not only am I constantly lying to him...

510
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:43,370
Or, more accurately,
withholding the truth.

511
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,941
I fear I'm leading him
down an unrighteous path.

512
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:52,477
Monsignor,

513
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,715
as someone who's known my family

514
00:21:54,717 --> 00:21:56,417
for longer than I've been alive,

515
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:58,585
I hope you understand my concern.

516
00:21:58,588 --> 00:22:00,675
I do, my child.

517
00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:04,839
And I pray you can offer some advice.

518
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:08,095
Ten Hail Marys, five Our Fathers.

519
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:16,670
Veronica,

520
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:19,640
how did your confession
with the Monsignor go?

521
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:21,742
To be honest, Tia,

522
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:24,664
I don't know if he gave
me much peace of mind.

523
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:28,082
Me, I go to Our Lady of Grace every day.

524
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:31,565
I light a candle and I put in
my requests to the Almighty.

525
00:22:31,568 --> 00:22:33,901
Terry, how many glasses is that?

526
00:22:33,904 --> 00:22:36,289
Requests for what?

527
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:37,825
For protection.

528
00:22:37,828 --> 00:22:40,661
Our husbands? The risks they take.

529
00:22:40,664 --> 00:22:43,480
Every day they come home in
one piece, it's a miracle.

530
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:46,700
Mmm. For me, I pray for forgiveness.

531
00:22:46,702 --> 00:22:47,933
I have everything.

532
00:22:47,936 --> 00:22:49,302
My husband... Your uncle,

533
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:51,133
he's good to me. And so I pray for him.

534
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,360
And for me. And for the kids.

535
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:56,744
And I also give to charities.
It helps me sleep at night.

536
00:22:57,646 --> 00:23:00,180
You have to find your thing, Veronica.

537
00:23:00,183 --> 00:23:01,688
I'm trying.

538
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:04,818
Was that your boyfriend who
came by the other day, Veronica?

539
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,220
- It was.
- Ah!

540
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:07,855
His name's Archie Andrews.

541
00:23:07,858 --> 00:23:10,742
And do we know him? His family?

542
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:12,426
He's a local boy.

543
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:14,902
An, uh, inocente.

544
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,938
_

545
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,064
_

546
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,816
_

547
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:28,925
Full house,

548
00:23:28,928 --> 00:23:30,411
aces over sixes.

549
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:32,750
You're on a lucky streak, Hiram.

550
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:34,745
That, or he's cheating us, Carl.

551
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:40,172
Kid's got hustle.

552
00:23:40,175 --> 00:23:42,256
What's your name, Red?

553
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:45,492
- Archie Andrews.
- Archie, this is Lenny Kowalski.

554
00:23:45,494 --> 00:23:47,159
Lenny runs canned meat out of Chicago.

555
00:23:47,162 --> 00:23:48,495
They call me "The Butcher."

556
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:50,831
He's pulling your leg,
kid. No one calls him that.

557
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,120
Carl Martin, of Martin Brewery.

558
00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:54,762
Finest beer in the Rust Belt.

559
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,770
I wouldn't say the finest.

560
00:23:56,772 --> 00:23:58,806
And this charming
fellow is Poppa Poutine.

561
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:01,175
He owns a chain of hot
dog restaurants in Quebec,

562
00:24:01,177 --> 00:24:02,776
which is why you never heard of him.

563
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,080
How's SoDale coming along there, Hiram?

564
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:08,382
Right on schedule?

565
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:10,951
Ah, no business talk, remember?

566
00:24:12,822 --> 00:24:14,769
Hey, kid, what was your name again?

567
00:24:14,772 --> 00:24:17,597
Archie. Archie Andrews.

568
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,160
Andrews, right.

569
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:24,152
Hiram... Doesn't your wife
know a guy named Andrews?

570
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:28,292
Yeah, she does.

571
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,372
Fred Andrews is one of
our business associates.

572
00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:37,399
Was that your decision to
make him a partner... Or hers?

573
00:24:41,503 --> 00:24:43,083
Smells delicious, Pop.

574
00:24:43,086 --> 00:24:45,034
Don't get a chance to
make poutine very often.

575
00:24:45,037 --> 00:24:46,536
I hope you enjoy it.

576
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,495
The hell is this?

577
00:24:49,498 --> 00:24:51,625
Those aren't cheese curds!

578
00:24:51,628 --> 00:24:53,861
I ordered poutine! This is vomit!

579
00:24:53,864 --> 00:24:56,396
- You own this dump?
- No.

580
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,031
I own it.

581
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:00,934
Now apologize.

582
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:03,821
Apologize? For what?

583
00:25:03,824 --> 00:25:06,224
For disrespecting Pop Tate.

584
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:13,250
I'm gonna go out and
get a little fresh air.

585
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:14,948
This place is a dive.

586
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:22,258
I'm sorry, Pop.

587
00:25:22,261 --> 00:25:25,085
If you'll excuse my guest's
lack of social graces.

588
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:31,365
Toilet's clogged.

589
00:25:34,103 --> 00:25:35,702
Enjoy your steak.

590
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:39,895
Ah, God.

591
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:43,877
Lodge is a problem.

592
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,479
Mmm-hmm.

593
00:25:45,481 --> 00:25:47,777
He lost his mojo in the joint.

594
00:25:50,504 --> 00:25:53,638
Went soft in the head and in the belly.

595
00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:56,581
Others, back home, feel the same way.

596
00:25:58,227 --> 00:25:59,993
Lodge is getting sloppy too.

597
00:25:59,995 --> 00:26:02,296
And that whole St. Clair kid thing?

598
00:26:02,298 --> 00:26:05,432
Exactly. Going after someone's
kid in such a blatant way?

599
00:26:05,434 --> 00:26:07,352
Who does that?

600
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:10,339
Ah... And partnering up with the man

601
00:26:10,342 --> 00:26:12,739
who's been messin'
around with your wife?

602
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:14,378
He's weak.

603
00:26:14,381 --> 00:26:16,910
This is our chance, Lenny.

604
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:19,527
You think he should be removed?

605
00:26:21,817 --> 00:26:23,983
Right after his daughter's confirmation.

606
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:26,632
I'll do it myself.

00:28:05,215 --> 00:28:08,834
renounce Satan and all evil works?

625
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:11,908
And do you walk in
the light of the Lord?

626
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:33,478
I do.

627
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:47,259
What a beautiful service.

628
00:28:47,262 --> 00:28:48,509
Sierra, how kind.

629
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:50,144
You can put that with
the rest of the gifts.

630
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,612
No, this one's for you.

631
00:28:51,615 --> 00:28:53,439
The sale's been finalized.

632
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:55,282
You're now the proud owners

633
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:57,803
of what was previously Southside High.

634
00:28:57,806 --> 00:28:59,787
Congratulations.

635
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,908
And to you, Madam Mayor.

636
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,933
Betty, you mind if I steal my man?

637
00:29:12,935 --> 00:29:14,868
It's time for Archie
to meet my abuelita.

638
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,275
Of course. I'm gonna
go look for Jug, anyway.

639
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:18,505
Come on, Archie.

640
00:29:23,544 --> 00:29:25,010
_

641
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,972
_

642
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,350
_

643
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:30,751
Hello, Abuelita. It's
an honor to meet you.

644
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:34,751
Ah. So handsome. Hello.

645
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:39,360
Ow.

646
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:40,561
Thank you.

647
00:29:40,564 --> 00:29:42,263
Hey.

648
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:45,579
It's not like Jughead Jones
to neglect a free buffet.

649
00:29:45,582 --> 00:29:48,725
You okay?

650
00:29:48,728 --> 00:29:51,405
No, it's the Serpents.

651
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:54,241
They're meeting to decide if
I'm getting kicked out or not.

652
00:29:54,243 --> 00:29:55,809
What, why are they doing that?

653
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:58,512
I broke a code, I messed up bad.

654
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:01,482
Really bad.

655
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:05,886
There's this person who suckered
me into delivering drugs.

656
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:09,056
And my dad, too,

657
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,889
he got roped in.

658
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,627
So, couple of Serpents and I, we...

659
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,862
Found her,

660
00:30:16,588 --> 00:30:18,087
grabbed her,

661
00:30:20,173 --> 00:30:21,556
and I cut her.

662
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,925
Cut her?

663
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:26,595
The worst part is,

664
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:28,524
none of it even matters.

665
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:29,927
'Cause she's back.

666
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:34,280
It's like every decision
I've made since we broke up,

667
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:36,817
including our break up, just
makes things worse and worse.

668
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:42,056
Hello.

669
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,459
Yes, it is.

670
00:30:45,328 --> 00:30:46,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

671
00:30:46,362 --> 00:30:48,562
We're the ones who put up the flyers.

672
00:30:48,565 --> 00:30:50,931
Okay, yeah. We can be right there.

673
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,104
Thanks for being here today.

674
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,544
I really needed to see your face.

675
00:31:06,716 --> 00:31:08,382
You're my beacon in the night.

676
00:31:09,585 --> 00:31:12,186
Hey, Archie, mind if I cut in?

677
00:31:12,188 --> 00:31:14,254
No, sir, of course not, Mr. Lodge.

678
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:25,532
Daddy... I've been thinking.

679
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,737
I don't want Archie brought into this.

680
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,772
This life... Our life.

681
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:34,908
If that's the way you want it to be.

682
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:36,366
It is.

683
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:38,479
I think it has to be.

684
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,314
Okay.

685
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,241
You the kids looking for a head?

686
00:31:47,244 --> 00:31:50,057
If only we lived in a town
where the answer could be no.

687
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:52,693
We are and you called
to say that you have it?

688
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:55,429
I got nearly ten acres
of scrap out there,

689
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:57,831
and I come across weird
stuff all the time.

690
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:01,275
But this is the first
time I found a bronze head.

691
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:04,540
It was stashed in an old refrigerator.

692
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,910
You didn't happen to
see who dumped this?

693
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:11,779
Has anyone suspicious been around here?

694
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:13,747
Well, I get scavengers all the time,

695
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:15,849
but there was a guy come in last week,

696
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,651
I'd never seen him before.

697
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:20,053
Claimed he wanted to
get some bike parts,

698
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:21,155
but he didn't buy anything.

699
00:32:21,157 --> 00:32:22,389
Well, did you get his name?

700
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:24,024
What did he look like?

701
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,392
Low-life type.

702
00:32:26,729 --> 00:32:28,603
Had on one of those jackets.

703
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,901
By any chance, was this gentleman tall?

704
00:32:33,904 --> 00:32:35,235
Sure was.

705
00:32:52,486 --> 00:32:54,788
I'm sorry, Mr. Lodge, can
I talk to you for a second?

706
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,537
Yeah, sure. What is it?

707
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,660
Not here. Your study.
Right now. It's important.

708
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,463
Okay. Let's go.

709
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:18,622
It's Poppa Poutine,

710
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,291
I overheard him at the poker game,

711
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:22,326
and I think he's planning something bad.

712
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:23,894
He said you were getting sloppy,

713
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:26,329
and that action needs to be taken.

714
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:28,299
I'm telling you, Mr. Lodge,

715
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:29,385
so you can protect yourself,

716
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:31,187
in case there's some kind of coup.

717
00:33:35,824 --> 00:33:37,308
Thank you, Archie.

718
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:40,986
You can go back to the party
now. Check on my daughter.

719
00:33:40,989 --> 00:33:43,047
Make sure she's having a good time.

720
00:34:08,357 --> 00:34:10,090
Stop the damn vote.

721
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,281
What the hell were you doing
at the dump last week, Tall Boy?

722
00:34:18,284 --> 00:34:20,168
I don't know what you're talking about.

723
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:23,086
I'm talkin' about you cutting
the head off the Pickens' statue

724
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:24,469
and stashing it at the dump

725
00:34:24,472 --> 00:34:26,071
where you were seen, dumbass.

726
00:34:26,074 --> 00:34:27,658
So start spilling!

727
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,282
Why'd you do it?

728
00:34:29,285 --> 00:34:31,128
Someone put you up to this?

729
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:33,297
What's the Northsider doing here?

730
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:37,485
This is Serpent business,
it's on Serpent land.

731
00:34:37,488 --> 00:34:40,340
She's here because she's one of us.

732
00:34:40,343 --> 00:34:43,073
You haven't answered my son's question:

733
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:44,809
Why'd you do it?

734
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:46,999
'Cause I'm tired of seeing the Serpents

735
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,702
goin' soft under your rule.

736
00:34:50,183 --> 00:34:51,882
Then Hiram Lodge came by,

737
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:53,344
wanting to stir up some trouble.

738
00:34:53,347 --> 00:34:55,114
He said if I took the head,

739
00:34:55,117 --> 00:34:57,770
he'd get McCoy and the
cops to swarm all over us,

740
00:34:57,773 --> 00:34:59,356
'cause some chaos.

741
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:01,025
So Hiram Lodge

742
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:02,936
asked you to start a mutiny

743
00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:05,473
and you helped him, why?

744
00:35:05,476 --> 00:35:09,278
I figured it'd be my chance
to get rid of you, sunshine.

745
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:12,059
And if I got rid of him,

746
00:35:12,062 --> 00:35:14,086
I could get rid of you, too, FP.

747
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:16,022
And then, what, you'd become leader?

748
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:17,490
He and Penny.

749
00:35:17,493 --> 00:35:18,841
You're a Judas, Tall Boy,

750
00:35:18,843 --> 00:35:19,976
and an idiot.

751
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:22,111
You betrayed your own kind, Tall Boy.

752
00:35:22,113 --> 00:35:23,679
You broke Serpent Law.

753
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:25,481
What should we do with this lowlife?

754
00:35:25,484 --> 00:35:27,017
Strip him of his jacket.

755
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,351
Exile him.

756
00:35:28,354 --> 00:35:30,400
All those in favor.

757
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:38,060
Looks like this piece of trash and I

758
00:35:38,062 --> 00:35:40,074
got a long ride ahead of us.

759
00:35:50,297 --> 00:35:52,535
What were you and my
father chatting about?

760
00:35:52,538 --> 00:35:54,736
We were just going over
some stuff for my internship.

761
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:56,285
Wait, that's still happening?

762
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,614
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

763
00:35:58,816 --> 00:36:00,383
I love you, Archie.

764
00:36:00,385 --> 00:36:01,517
But we can't keep dating

765
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:04,253
unless you understand
something about my family.

766
00:36:04,255 --> 00:36:06,017
About my father.

767
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,524
Look, I wanted to protect you from this,

768
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:12,001
but every day, you're getting
in deeper and deeper and...

769
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:14,933
The truth is, Archie...

770
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:18,004
My dad... He's...

771
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,736
- He's a...
- A mobster.

772
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:24,019
I know, Ronnie.

773
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,289
I've seen all those movies.

774
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:27,289
And the poker game last night.

775
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:30,713
Well, I mean, I wouldn't
put it so baldly.

776
00:36:30,715 --> 00:36:33,749
But, Archie, it's not just what he is,

777
00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:35,605
it's what he's planning to do.

778
00:36:35,608 --> 00:36:36,774
In Riverdale.

779
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,987
SoDale is just the
beginning, it's actually...

780
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:39,422
- Stop.
- No, Archie.

781
00:36:39,424 --> 00:36:40,723
- You need to know this.
- No, I don't want to know.

782
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,765
- Archie, he's going to...
- Veronica, I can't know.

783
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:46,862
I... I don't need to know.

784
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:49,120
Veronica, I love you.

785
00:36:49,131 --> 00:36:51,542
And there's nothing you could ever say

786
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:52,917
that would change that.

787
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,515
Or make me regret being with you.

788
00:36:54,518 --> 00:36:55,750
Or scare me away.

789
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:59,508
You don't have to protect
me from this, any of it.

790
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,932
I love you, Ronnie.

791
00:37:01,935 --> 00:37:03,679
I'm with you.

792
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:19,037
Good ol' Hiram Lodge.

793
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:22,640
I wonder what he's planning for us.

794
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:25,076
And the Southside?

795
00:37:27,147 --> 00:37:29,614
Maybe we can ask Veronica on Monday.

796
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:31,098
Yeah.

797
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:33,318
Maybe we should just investigate quietly

798
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,819
until we know more.

799
00:37:36,656 --> 00:37:38,757
We haven't saved the trailer park yet.

800
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:41,593
And I'm on probation from the Serpents,

801
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:42,994
whatever that means.

802
00:37:42,996 --> 00:37:44,729
Because of what I did to Penny.

803
00:37:46,274 --> 00:37:48,548
But we stopped her from coming back.

804
00:37:48,551 --> 00:37:50,938
And we got rid of Tall Boy.

805
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:53,970
We.

806
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:55,907
It's nice to hear that again.

807
00:37:57,444 --> 00:37:59,077
Look, I'll be apologizing for it

808
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:01,535
for the rest of my life, but I'm sorry.

809
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:02,704
I am.

810
00:38:02,707 --> 00:38:05,150
Feeling like I needed to shield you

811
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:07,185
from what I was going
through with the Serpents

812
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:10,110
or my darkness.

813
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:11,790
I can handle it.

814
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:16,795
I know.

815
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:19,316
I know you can.

816
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,684
I should probably

817
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:33,145
start headin' home.

818
00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:34,848
Or you could stay.

819
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,849
Stay.

820
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,547
Wait, wait, wait.

821
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:11,349
- I need to tell you something.
- What?

822
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,584
What is it?

823
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:19,691
Nothing.

824
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:22,994
I just want you.

825
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:26,764
I want all of you tonight.

826
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:37,008
This is typical of your sister.

827
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,076
She gets caught up in something

828
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:40,306
and drops off the face of the Earth.

829
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:42,280
What about Hal? Where's he?

830
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:43,982
Hal...

831
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:45,617
That's probably him now.

832
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:56,918
Hi. Is Chic home?

833
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:04,569
What are you doing here, Agent Adams?

834
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,904
My dad's not even asleep yet.

835
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:07,172
This couldn't wait.

836
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:09,484
Paul Boucher was found
dead in his hotel room

837
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:12,532
less than an hour ago, shot
in the back of the head.

838
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,045
Who's Paul Boucher?

839
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:16,622
His mob name is Poppa Poutine.

840
00:40:18,051 --> 00:40:21,274
This is extremely important, Archie.

841
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:23,855
Boucher was a guest at
Veronica's confirmation.

842
00:40:23,857 --> 00:40:26,424
Did you see or hear something, anything,

843
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,126
that could implicate Hiram Lodge

844
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:30,293
in what is obviously a gangland slaying?

845
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:36,845
No.

846
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:38,191
Nothing.

847
00:40:38,194 --> 00:40:39,759
Found one last gift for you

848
00:40:39,762 --> 00:40:41,334
in the lobby, Miss Veronica.

849
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:42,974
A big one!

850
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:52,514
Mom...

851
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,230
Dad...

852
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:56,387
I think this might be for you.

853
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:19,744
Hello?

854
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,461
Mom?

855
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:40,070
Elizabeth, did you lock the front door?

856
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:46,295
