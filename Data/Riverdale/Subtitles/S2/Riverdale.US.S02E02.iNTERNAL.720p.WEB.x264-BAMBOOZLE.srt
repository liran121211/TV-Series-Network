[Pop]<i> This man... His
goal was something else.</i>

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,750
It was like Angel of Death
had come to Riverdale.

00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,880
[screaming]

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,210
Hello, Dilton.

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,080
Somebody has to teach them how to stand
their ground. The way this town is going...

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,790
[Ms. Weiss]<i> Your father's

[Tall Boy]<i> Serpents

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,250
We got your back.

11
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,880
Smithers, would you describe
my father as a good man?

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,920
I'd rather not say, miss.

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,580
I told your father that you were...
Conflicted about helping him.

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,250
"If you do not testify, your poor mother
might be drawn into this awful mess."

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,920
Whether or not Sheriff Keller finds
the person who did this or not,

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,420
<i> you don't have to worry.</i>

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,170
<i> I'm gonna protect you.
I swear it.</i>

[Jughead]<i> Behold, Pop's
Chock'lit Shoppe.</i>

00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,210
<i> For decades, the
heart of Riverdale.</i>

20

-Pop?
-[Pop] Did you see?

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,080
Did you see what they wrote
on my Chock'lit Shoppe?

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,500
[Archie] No, no, no, no.

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,670
[Fred coughing] Do we
need a fire extinguisher?

28
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,830
What are you doing up? I was
going to bring you breakfast.

29
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,500
I appreciate it, son.

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,620
But I've gotta get to
moving around sometime.

31
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,120
Little early for that, isn't it?

32
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,920
No, I'm good.

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,750
Dad, the only thing you
need to be worrying about

34
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,920
is getting better.

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,330
[phone ringing]

36
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,210
Crap. I gotta take this.
I gotta go. Bye.

37
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,120
Hi. Sheriff Keller?

38
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,250
No, no. Deputy, I've been leaving
messages for the sheriff.

39
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,460
I need him to call me
back about my dad's case.

40
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,710
[sighing]

41
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,080
TTFN, Smithers.

42
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,330
Oh, wait, Ms. Veronica. You might
want to take the side exit.

43
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,120
-Why?
-[door opening and closing]

44
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,960
[Hiram] Yeah, why, Smithers?

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,000
Because she might bump into me
coming in from an early run?

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,330
[Veronica] Good morning, Father.

47
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,830
<i> Mija.</i> You leave
before breakfast,

48
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,170
you come after your mother
and I have had dinner.

49
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,500
I can't remember the last time

50
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,830
we had meal together
as a family.

51
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,380
I can. It was at the Dakota.

52
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,000
The day you got arrested.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
Well, perhaps we should
talk about that.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,710
Tonight, at dinner.
The three of us.

55
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,170
Unfortunately, I have plans.

56
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,250
To quote that <i> New
Yorker</i> cartoon,

57
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,120
how about never, Dad,
is never good for you?

58
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,290
[Jughead]<i> It's another
win for the bad guys.</i>

59
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,040
No one was there. His
entire staff quit.

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,540
He says he's not sure how long

61
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,620
he'll be able to
keep the doors open,

62
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,290
maybe not even a week.

63
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,170
It's because of what
happened to my dad.

64
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,210
People are freaking out. And
I gotta be honest, guys,

65
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,250
I don't see myself going
back any time soon.

66
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,920
Wait, I'm sorry, am I
hearing acceptance?

67
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,420
I'm not letting one
psychopath with a gun

68
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,830
dictate what happens
to our place.

69
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,080
Jug, you went crazy trying
to save the drive-in.

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,960
I can't take on any more
social issues right now.

71
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,080
My hands are full.

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,170
With your dad, of course.

73
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,670
And he should be your priority.

74
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,580
[sighs]

75
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,750
I'll take point on
helping Pop Tate.

76
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,580
I'll help, too, Betty.

77
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,540
Hey, anything to get me away
from my parents, I'm in.

78
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,750
Another Bee and Vee team-up.

79
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,670
They should really make a
video game about you guys.

80
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,330
-[giggles]
-[Jughead] I gotta jet.

81
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,380
I'm off to meet my dad's
court-appointed joke

82
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,620
of a lawyer at the
sheriff's station.

83
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,170
I'm gonna come with you, Jug.

84
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,580
I gotta drop some flyers
off for Sheriff Keller.

85
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,750
[Veronica] Bye.

86
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,250
[door opens]

87
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,710
Sheriff Keller.

88
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,080
Archie, how's your
dad holding up?

89
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,710
Honestly, he'd be
doing a lot better

90
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,080
if you caught the
guy who shot him.

91
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,210
We're doing everything we can.

92
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,460
Yeah, me, too. I'm out
here handing out flyers,

93
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,080
talking to neighbors,

94
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,460
tracking my dad's credit cards

95
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,250
because his wallet
is still missing.

96
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,420
Which means this guy has all
of our personal information,

97
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,120
including where we live.

98
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,790
And we were witnesses.

99
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,290
If your guys are out there
patrolling, Sheriff,

100
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,460
-let me go with them, I can help.
-Oh, no.

101
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,620
[man over police radio] <i> 10-4.
We've got a 53 in Greendale.</i>

102
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,290
Greendale? All right, copy that.
Just give me a sec.

103
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,380
Let us do our job.

104
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,620
You take care.

105
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,920
Let's talk about the damn deal.

106
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,920
First, to review the
charges you're facing,

107
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,330
arson, destruction of evidence,
making a false confession,

108
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,080
obstructing justice,
not to mention this

109
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,960
whole nasty mess of dumping
a dead kid in the river.

110
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,620
I know what I did.

111
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,790
What's the deal?

112
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,710
What are they offering?

113
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,670
You're gonna want to take it.

114
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,880
I'm telling you, I've been
doing this a long time.

115
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,500
It's a strong deal.

116
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,380
How many damn years?

117
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,670
[creaking]

118
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,750
Whoa, whoa!

119
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,540
-Jughead. Are you insane?
-Hey

120
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,210
You're the one that looks like a Dream
Warrior from<i> Nightmare on Elm Street 3.</i>

121
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,080
What did the lawyer say?

122
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,710
I've been walking around all night trying
to wrap my head around how bad it is.

123
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,080
It's bad.

124
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,040
My dad is facing 20 years, Arch.

125
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,330
Crap, Jughead, I'm sorry.
That sucks.

126
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,210
The lawyer thinks he
should take the deal.

127
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,420
And that if he doesn't, and the case goes
to trial, he could be facing 40 years.

128
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,420
I'm just really, really scared.

129
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,790
Yeah, me, too.

130
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,000
About what?

131
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,210
[gunshot sound]

132
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,880
I couldn't sleep
last night, Jug.

133
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,880
I kept thinking about
your dad, and Pop's.

134
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,620
And how maybe we can kill
two birds with one stone.

135
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,120
Can you meet me at
the Mayor's office?

136
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Okay, great, I'll get it set.

137
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,620
But right now, I need to call...

138
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,960
Hey, Bee, what's up?

139
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,380
[knocking at door]

140
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,330
I know you haven't been
sleeping in your room.

141
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,120
So where exactly have you
been spending your nights?

142
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,920
[Archie] So, Betty.
[Veronica] Yes, Betty.

143
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,380
Ever since you and your dad
got home from the hospital,

144
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,790
she's noticed your room's been
unusually empty and quiet.

145
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,670
Why?

146
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,710
So I can... Watch the doors.

147
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,460
So I can make sure
no one comes in.

148
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,620
I know it sounds crazy, but
the guy who shot my dad

149
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,040
is still out there, Ronnie,

150
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,380
and I'm scared he's
gonna come back

151
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,920
and finish the job.

152
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,830
Archie,

153
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,500
you went through something
deeply traumatic.

154
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,250
Can I make a suggestion?

155
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,290
Please. Anything.

156
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,170
When I lived in New York,

157
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,960
I saw a therapist once a
week to help me get through

158
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,620
all sorts of Park Avenue drama.

159
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,750
Now, I'm not saying to go
see a therapist, Archie,

160
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,500
but maybe the school
counselor could help?

161
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,120
[Betty] Mayor McCoy.

162
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,210
Betty, Jughead. What
can I help you with?

163
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,500
So, the Chock'lit Shoppe is
on the verge of closing,

164
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,670
and we want Pop Tate to
know that the entire town

165
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,620
is rallying behind him.

166
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,210
We were thinking
that you could...

167
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,830
[stammering] Make the
building a landmark,

168
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,500
or declare a "Pop's
Day" in support?

169
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,420
What if I endorse Pop's, and next
week someone else is shot there?

170
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,500
My priority as a mayor and as a
mother is keeping this town safe.

171
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,330
If we have to close
Pop's, I'm all for it.

172
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,040
Are you also "all for" shipping
my dad off to a state prison

173
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,120
-for a murder that he didn't commit?
-Shh.

174
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,000
What is this, an ambush?

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,120
I know you have an in
with the State Attorney.

176
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,380
If you could just call him and try
to get my dad a better lawyer,

177
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,500
anything?

178
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,330
Your father made some mistakes,

179
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sure he'll get
a fair hearing.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,040
[Jughead] Mayor McCoy?

181
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,290
You remember this moment.

182
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,080
'Cause this is the moment
that you turned your back

183
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,830
on both Pop Tate and my father.

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,080
Midge Klump.

185
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,710
The Klumpster.

186
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,460
Reggie,

187
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,750
what do you know
about jingle-jangle?

188
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,040
I know you shouldn't say it so loud
while we're on school property.

189
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,420
[whispering] And that
I can score you some.

190
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,120
Who's it for?

191
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,000
Me and Moose.

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,250
Lemme see what I can do.

193
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,710
What's on your mind, Andrews?

194
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,670
Girl troubles, scabies?

195
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,880
Why are you seeking guidance from Ms.
Burble?

196
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,620
-I'm not.
-Maybe you should.

197
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,120
You look like my nuts
after football practice.

198
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,880
Hey. Do you have anything
that can help keep me awake?

199
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,460
Many things.

200
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,620
Amphetamines, Baclofen,
Modafinil, jingle-jangle.

201
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,620
Jingle-jangle?

202
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,750
That'll keep you up for days,
in more ways than one.

203
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,920
But why do you need
uppers, Wonder Bread?

204
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,880
Until the guy who shot
my dad is caught,

205
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,290
I wanna be on high alert.

206
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,750
So, can you help
me or not, Reggie?

207
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,120
I got you, Andrews.

208
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,710
[slap]

209
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,830
[Betty]<i> We can't let
the terrorists win.</i>

210
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,000
We need to host
an event at Pop's

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,380
that reminds the town
of simpler times.

212
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,080
Like, a throwback to when the
shoppe first opened its doors.

213
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,000
Betty, I like a good milkshake
as much as any girl,

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,170
and Pop's puts Serendipity
3's to shame.

215
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,540
But, why this hill to die on?

216
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,750
Orange freezes with my mom
and Polly after ballet.

217
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,330
Chicken noodle soup with my
dad after ice-skating...

218
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,670
Grilled cheeses with Archie on
the last day of summer vacation.

219
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,170
<i> It's where I met you for
the first time, Vee.</i>

220
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,000
It's where I met you
for the first time.

221
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,120
Also...

222
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,710
Jug.

223
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,790
He may lose his dad,

224
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,620
but maybe I can save this one
place for him... For all of us.

225
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,960
[knocking at door]

226
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,290
Hey. Veronica. May
I speak to you?

227
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,210
Daddy?

228
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,290
-Daddy?
-Daddy?

229
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,460
Every day I was in prison, I
thought about getting back to you

230
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,540
and your mother.

231
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,500
And I knew it wouldn't be easy,

232
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,880
I knew it would take time.

233
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,580
Meet me halfway.

234
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,210
Don't you think I
want to, Daddy?

235
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,670
Don't you think I want everything
to go back to the way it was?

236
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,500
The three of us, walking into
some fabulous gala or ball.

237
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,620
You with your two
favorite girls.

238
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,620
But...

239
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,000
I can't.

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,620
The blindfold's off, Daddy, I
can't just put it back on.

241
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,290
I'm sorry, but I should
get back to my friends.

242
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, hey, so... Were you, uh...

243
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,580
Planning a dance in there?

244
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,880
An event. To keep
Pop's from closing.

245
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,920
Well, if I can help in any way--

246
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,170
I'll let you know.

247
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,960
[Jughead] <i>I tried going
the legit route.</i>

248
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,920
I even talked to the mayor.
It's just...

249
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,080
It feels like the whole
system's rigged against us.

250
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,540
What's FP saying?

251
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,920
Is he taking this deal?

252
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Not if I can help it.

253
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,210
Tall Boy...

254
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,460
What if we bust him out of jail

255
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,920
before he gets
transferred to state?

256
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,000
[Tall Boy scoffs]

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,420
It's totally doable.
The sheriff's station

258
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,580
has worse security
than Riverdale High.

259
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,040
And once he's out, it's just a straight
shot right up Sweetwater River

260
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,210
until the Canadian border.

261
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,290
You've seen <i> Escape From Alcatraz</i>
a few too many times, kid.

262
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,040
Your dad needs a snake-handler.

263
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,420
Someone whose livelihood
depends on snakes.

264
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,330
Who's used to dealing with 'em.

265
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,580
I got someone you should meet.

266
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,620
[Cheryl] Humpty and Dumpty.

267
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,330
Just in time to meet
our newest recruit.

268
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,670
In addition to my
duties as a Pussycat.

269
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,540
And, I just wanna say,
girls, I'm so excited

270
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,000
to work on my moves

271
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,750
and to be a team player,

272
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,790
as long as I'm in the front.

273
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,040
Wait, Cheryl,

274
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,670
does that mean you're taking
the Vixens back from me?

275
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,710
But, really, Veronica,

276
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,500
were they ever yours?

277
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,960
Cheryl, we were wondering if
maybe the Vixens would help

278
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,460
at an event to save Pop's.

279
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,750
Oh, Betty.

280
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,790
I did not emerge from the frozen
depths of Sweetwater River,

281
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,330
nor the flames of Thornhill,

282
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,170
to allow my Vixens
to sling milkshakes

283
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,000
at some death-cursed diner.

284
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,330
The answer is a
double-cherry-on-top no.

285
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,880
Okay.

286
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,540
Great talk.

287
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,040
[Weatherbee]<i> May I have
everyone's attention?</i>

288
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,540
I have some tragic
news to share.

289
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,580
Ms. Grundy,

290
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,210
who was a teacher
here last semester,

291
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,380
was found

292
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,210
murdered in her Greendale
home last night.

293
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,210
Oh, my God.

294
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,000
[Weatherbee] I know some of
you were students of hers,

295
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,380
<i> and that this news will
be difficult to process.</i>

296
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,210
[inaudible]

297
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,120
Mr. Andrews?

298
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,460
First, you get shot.

299
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,120
Then, Ms. Grundy is murdered.

300
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,380
All within a matter of days.

301
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,580
Dad, what if some crazy person is going
after the people that I care about?

302
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,080
What? You think I'm nuts?

303
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,620
No, son, I think you're scared.

304
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,000
Understandably so.

305
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,080
Truth is, son, we don't know anything
about what happened to Ms. Grundy.

306
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,420
She's dead, she was killed.

307
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,080
Right across Sweetwater River.

308
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,580
I know.

309
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,210
It was a horrible thing.

310
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,420
Don't you wanna find
out who did this?

311
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,710
Who's doing this?

312
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,210
-[tattoo needle buzzing]
-[rock music playing]

313
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,040
I'm, uh, here for Penny Peabody?

314
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,120
[Penny] Forgive
the office space,

315
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,420
but I'm a firm believer
in low overhead.

316
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,880
Plus, I like being
close to my clients.

317
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,290
Your clients...

318
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,830
Being the Serpents?

319
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,000
Well, I was and
still am a Serpent.

320
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,290
They put me through college,

321
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,000
law school.

322
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,960
Right.

323
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,170
The Serpents are often on the
other side of the law, so...

324
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,080
Having one of their own,
on retainer, helping out

325
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,460
is clever.

326
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,670
Well, FP always bragged
that you were smart.

327
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,500
Oh, yeah, I know your dad.

328
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,880
And I also know, from
our, uh, mutual friends,

329
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,040
the deal he's been offered.

330
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,380
It's garbage.

331
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,580
Can you help?

332
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,710
I know the loopholes. In
this case, there are none.

333
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,710
But, if you get the victim's
family to forgive him,

334
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,880
in front of a judge,

335
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,580
that might shift
things in FP's favor.

336
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,880
Instead of 20 years, he
can get time served,

337
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,000
-with parole.
-Oh, that's great.

338
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,540
Yeah.

339
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,790
Thank you. Uh, am I
supposed to pay you, or...

340
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,790
We're friends.

341
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,250
I do you a favor.

342
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,290
One day, maybe, you
do me a favor.

343
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,170
Let me know how it
goes, will you?

344
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,460
Tell your dad to wear a tie.

345
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,580
You're twitching, Archie. Which
means this must be serious.

346
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,670
I think the same
person who shot my dad

347
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,330
may have murdered Ms. Grundy.

348
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,790
My, my.

349
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,920
We've come a long way
since dances at the gym

350
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,210
and varsity football
tryouts, haven't we?

351
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,880
[sighs] You were the first to know
anything about Jason's autopsy, Mom.

352
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,420
So, Archie's wondering if...

353
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,170
If I can get details on Ms.
Grundy's death

354
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,420
and see if they line up
with the attack on Fred.

355
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,580
It would be really helpful to
put Archie's mind at ease.

356
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,290
Fine. I'll reach out
to my ghoulish friend.

357
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,540
-Thank you, Mrs. Cooper.
-Mm.

358
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,250
-Thanks, Betty.
-Mm.

359
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,920
I should go.

360
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,080
I'll call you, Arch.

361
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,330
Spreading ourself a little thin

362
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,040
as the patron saint of lost
causes, aren't we, Betty?

363
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,250
Oh, you can cross saving
Pop's off your list.

364
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,920
Oh, haven't you heard?

365
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,170
Pop Tate is selling
the Chock'lit Shoppe.

366
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,960
What? To who?

367
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,250
To, and you'll love this,

368
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,580
an anonymous buyer.

369
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,960
Ring any bells?

370
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,880
Oh, Ms. Veronica. I'll
take those for you.

371
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,960
-Oh, thank you, Smithers.
-[phone ringing]

372
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,420
Hey, girl.

373
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,210
What?

374
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,040
<i> Are you buying Pop's?</i>

375
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,620
The way you bought the drive-in?

376
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,620
Anonymously?

377
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,620
And are you doing
this just to buy me?

378
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,210
Yesterday, at school,
did you think,

379
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,290
"Oh, Veronica's working so hard
to save the Chock'lit Shoppe,

380
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,080
I'll just save it for her!"

381
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,120
Veronica, I'm not buying Pop's.

382
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,000
Now, please, lower
your voice and sit

383
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,620
so we can speak civilly.

384
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,250
Do you really want to talk, Dad?

385
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,210
That's all I've wanted.
A fair hearing.

386
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,500
To explain myself.

387
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,330
Okay.

388
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,040
Let's talk about Mr. Andrews.

389
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,330
Mom asked him to sell his
portion of the SoDale project,

390
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,830
and the day after he
rejected the offer,

391
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,250
he was shot in Pop's.

392
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,080
Was it your doing?

393
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,000
Veronica, first you accuse
me, then your father?

394
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,460
No, no.

395
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,710
I didn't shoot Fred.

396
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,330
Nor did I hire someone to do it.

397
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,080
I was your fiercest
protector, Dad.

398
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,540
Ask Mom.

399
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,540
Whenever somebody called
you the devil incarnate,

400
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,960
I defended you.

401
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,830
I kept telling myself,

402
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,080
"He's not that bad.

403
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,960
You can forgive him."

404
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,380
And then you sent me this.

405
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,040
A letter threatening you, Mom.

406
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,750
That's the kind of man you're
letting back into our lives.

407
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,710
[Hermione] Veronica?

408
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,120
Your father didn't
write this letter.

409
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,580
I did.

410
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,540
I don't understand.

411
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,830
I needed you to testify
on your father's behalf.

412
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,290
So I wrote this letter.
Threatening myself.

413
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,710
Not your father.

414
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,920
She did it for us.

415
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,120
To survive.

416
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,460
So we can be a family again.

417
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,620
You two deserve each other.

418
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
It's not exactly
downsizing, is it?

419
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,290
[knocking at door]

420
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,830
Hobo. Bride of Hobo.

421
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,500
Welcome to Thistlehouse.

422
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,290
Mother's in the conservatory.

423
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,500
Follow me.

424
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,290
Thank you for sitting
down with us.

425
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,830
Of course, Betty. You're family.

426
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,040
[Jughead] Okay.

427
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,500
The reason we're here...

428
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,580
FP's lawyer thinks that if
the family of the victim

429
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,960
shows mercy...

430
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,750
Mercy.

431
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,580
That's why you're here?

432
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,460
Well, it's an appeal
for leniency from you.

433
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,670
To reduce my dad's sentence.

434
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,080
Where was your father's mercy when
I spent those countless nights

435
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,670
walking the halls of
Thornhill in agony,

436
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,580
obsessing over what was
happening to Jay-Jay?

437
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,420
Imagining the worst.

438
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,380
Where was your father's mercy

439
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,790
when I slept under the same
roof as a cold-blooded killer,

440
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,960
night after night.

441
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,710
Cheryl...

442
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,080
FP didn't kill Jason.

443
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,880
Okay? That was your dad.

444
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,330
You saw the video.

445
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,120
If it were up to
me, I'd watch FP

446
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,290
fry in the electric chair.

447
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,500
We need this sordid
chapter closed forever,

448
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,330
and FP is the last
loose end to tie up.

449
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,250
I will not have a living,
breathing reminder

450
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,710
of the darkest
chapter of my life

451
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,330
walking the streets
of Riverdale.

452
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,960
What do we do now that
Cheryl's gone full Poison Ivy?

453
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,460
Blackmail. Extortion.

454
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,380
If they weren't weren't literally an
orphan and a widow, I would do it.

455
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,000
[sighs]

456
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,250
[coroner] Lacerations on the neck.
Her trachea's crushed.

457
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,620
Broken veins in her eyes

458
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,500
and the skin tears
suggest brutality.

459
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,620
This is a crime of passion.

460
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,170
Hatred.

461
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,330
He wanted to feel her
struggle as she died.

462
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,080
Tell me, Mrs. Cooper, did
you know the victim?

463
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,460
No.

464
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,120
[grunting]

465
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,120
Stop!

466
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,120
It's me.

467
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,380
Are you freakin' insane?

468
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,250
What the hell are you
doing here, Reggie?

469
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,620
Delivering your uppers, clearly
the last thing you need.

470
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,000
You've lost it, Andrews.

471
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,210
You're the one here
wearing this hood.

472
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,620
It's called a prank,

473
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,080
I didn't expect
you to attack me.

474
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,750
What if I had been the guy? Eh?

475
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,790
You would have just tackled him?

476
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,710
Yeah. Damn right.

477
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,460
He has a gun, Andrews.

478
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,380
He's shot people.

479
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,500
Only a dumbass lunatic brings
a baseball bat to a gunfight.

480
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,880
[both panting]

481
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,040
There was no sign
of forced entry,

482
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,330
which probably means
she knew her killer.

483
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,460
The police don't know if any of her
personal belongings were taken.

484
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,250
How, uh...

485
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,960
How did Ms. Grundy die?

486
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,750
The autopsy showed that
she was strangled.

487
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,500
With something the
killer grabbed on hand.

488
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,210
A cello bow, of all things.

489
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,330
There was a struggle.

490
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,960
She fought back.

491
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,670
But, Archie, this was
a crime of passion,

492
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,120
in another town with a completely
different murder weapon.

493
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,880
The likelihood of these two
crimes being connected

494
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,170
seems slim.

495
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,120
Son...

496
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,460
If I say what I'm thinking, you're
just gonna think I'm crazy.

497
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,580
Probably Mrs. Cooper's right.

498
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,620
Probably they're not connected.

499
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,330
[Jughead]<i> So, why'd
you do it, Pop?</i>

500
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,120
Did they make you an offer
you couldn't refuse?

501
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,710
Who's buying it?
Do you even know?

502
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,040
[Pop] It shames me to say.

503
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,330
ChugMo.

504
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,750
The liquor store chain?

505
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,920
Hey, could I make a request of you, Pop?
For a last supper?

506
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,790
Anything you want.

507
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,710
Actually, it's not for
me, it's for my dad.

508
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,790
He's facing 20 years

509
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,540
of that weird meatloaf
that they serve prisoners.

510
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,920
So, barring an eleventh-hour
miracle, I was

511
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,960
kind of hoping for his
last meal in Riverdale

512
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,460
that you could make
him his favorite.

513
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,210
Fried chicken,
cornbread, onion rings

514
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,620
and an orange freeze,
if memory serves.

515
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,920
It's very<i> Rain Man</i> of you, Pop.

516
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,040
Been doing this a long time.

517
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,920
Thought I'd be doing it
until the day I die.

518
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,330
This is...

519
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,420
Unacceptable.

520
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,670
-What?
-Just everything.

521
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,580
Pop, have you officially
sold the diner?

522
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,000
The contract's being drawn up.

523
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,580
Do not sign it.

524
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,250
Okay? Do not give up.
Either of you.

525
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,080
I can fix this, all right?

526
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,380
I will fix this.

527
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,790
Okay? Bye.

528
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,170
-[door closes]
-[gasps]

529
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,960
Give a girl a warning, will you?

530
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,620
You want closure, Cheryl.

531
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,000
I want to help my
boyfriend's dad.

532
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,040
I already told you.

533
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,790
And I'm telling you

534
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,710
to help FP.

535
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,330
-Or...
-Or what?

536
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,330
Or I wide-release the video of
your father shooting Jason.

537
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,420
Try having closure with
that out in the world.

538
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,710
I thought you gave that damned
thumb drive to Sheriff Keller.

539
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,670
No. Not before I saved a
copy onto Jughead's laptop.

540
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,420
One click,

541
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,710
and the darkest chapter of your
family's twisted psychodrama

542
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,210
becomes a viral sensation.

543
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,830
Are you threatening me?

544
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,960
This? No.

545
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,880
No, this is...

546
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,580
Fun girl talk.

547
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,420
You could save a man's life.

548
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,880
Think about that.

549
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,580
A nice ending to a sad story.

550
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,120
If I testify,

551
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,080
you're giving me that video.

552
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,620
And a guarantee that any
and all other copies

553
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,080
in your possession
will be erased.

554
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,040
You have my word.

555
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Also,

556
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,380
I need the Vixens.
For Retro Night.

557
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,460
You're a stone-cold
bitch, Betty Cooper.

558
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
I don't have red hair,

559
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,080
nor broad shoulders,

560
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,750
or a blonde ponytail,
for that matter.

561
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,250
Do you wanna talk?

562
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,710
You were ready to walk away

563
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,880
from your dad.

564
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,080
And now, you're crusading
for his freedom.

565
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,580
What changed?

566
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,710
He did.

567
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,830
He made an effort.

568
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,580
Took another swing
at being a good dad.

569
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,040
But don't you think

570
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,250
some people can't change?

571
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,080
Like, it's just in
their DNA to be bad?

572
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,330
I'm not gonna presume to know
what lies in your father's heart.

573
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,670
But Archie's dad almost died.

574
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,750
And my dad is going
away for 20 years.

575
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,170
If there's even a .0001% chance

576
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,540
-that your dad is trying--
-I get it.

577
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,250
Thank you, Jughead.

578
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,790
Sheriff, I believe the
man who shot my dad

579
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,620
is the same person that killed Ms.
Grundy.

580
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,500
And I think I know who it is.

581
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,080
You know, that's, uh... That's
quite a statement, Archie.

582
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,120
Ms. Grundy had an
abusive ex-husband.

583
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,210
She moved to Riverdale
to get away from him.

584
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,170
She kept a gun in her car in
case he'd ever come back.

585
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,540
How do you know all this?

586
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,330
Because she and I were...

587
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,540
We were close.

588
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,670
And I'm thinking... He
found out about me.

589
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,670
Ms. Grundy was killed
with a cello bow.

590
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,000
I gave her one before
she left Riverdale.

591
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,080
I'm betting it's
the murder weapon.

592
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,790
Can't you see, he's
sending me a message.

593
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,670
Your theory's wrong, Archie.

594
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,790
My counterparts in Greendale

595
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,460
already brought in her ex.

596
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,250
And he has an airtight alibi.

597
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,540
[exhales]

598
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,960
Maybe everyone's right.

599
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,080
Maybe I am going crazy.

600
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,500
Hey, has Betty called?

601
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,500
Not yet. Let's pray Cheryl
comes through for them.

602
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,210
[judge]<i> Ms. Blossom, you may
proceed with your statement.</i>

603
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:48,880
Your Honor, I speak for myself
and my mother when I say

604
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,080
we forgive FP Jones for
the part he played

605
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,670
in covering up my
brother's murder,

606
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,080
and we humbly ask the
court for leniency.

607
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,420
FP's guilt has been
blown out of proportion

608
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,580
to satiate what my father's
suicide denied us.

609
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,000
Closure.

610
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,920
As much as I sympathize,

611
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,880
I can't ignore the quality of Mr.
Jones' crimes.

612
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,460
There were no extenuating
circumstances.

613
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,420
My father threatened him.

614
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,460
I overheard them talking
in Daddy's study.

615
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,710
Daddy said he would hurt
Jughead if FP didn't comply.

616
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,830
Is that extenuating enough?

617
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,120
[judge] In light of
these revelations,

618
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,250
I suggest that we
take a step back

619
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,540
and reevaluate certain
aspects of the case.

620
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,580
At which time, we will
revisit the sentencing.

621
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,500
Adjourned.

622
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,120
Is that a win?

623
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,170
It's a delay. So, yeah.

624
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,000
[sobbing quietly]

625
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,670
No one's here.

626
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,960
No one's coming.

627
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,120
It's still early, okay?

628
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,830
Mom.

629
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,750
What, did you come to gloat?

630
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,620
Oh, don't be so
cynical, Elizabeth.

631
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,790
I came to write my next story
over one last root beer float.

632
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,210
I'm calling it
"Requiem for Pop's."

633
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,290
Can I get a quote, dear?

634
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,830
You're a fiend, Mother,

635
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,960
but this is one obituary
that you're not gonna write.

636
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,670
All right, two strawberries,

637
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,000
one vanilla,

638
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,750
and one chocolate
with extra malt.

639
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,380
[clears throat]

640
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,170
Why the hell did you broadcast
all over social media that

641
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,750
the Pussycats would be doing
a free concert here tonight?

642
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,040
I knew that if I asked
you, you would have said--

643
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,750
-No!
-Mmm-hmm.

644
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,120
If my mom even hears that I
set foot in this place--

645
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,080
Josie, you care about this
place, I know you do.

646
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,330
I see you in here all the time.

647
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,290
Betty, even if I wanted
to help, I'm down a cat.

648
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,830
-Valerie has norovirus--
-I don't mind stepping in.

649
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,080
After all, if you can
be a River Vixen,

650
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,380
Josie, I can be a Pussycat.

651
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,710
As long as it's a cover, I'm
sure I'll know the lyrics.

652
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,500
I mean, you do love your
cheese fries, Josie...

653
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,170
[sighing]

654
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,170

-Hey.
-You made it.

00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,210
You feeling okay?

672
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,790
Yeah. Just taking deep breaths.

673
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,830
I'm proud of you.

And I'll get you a shake.

We're not here to fight,
we're here to be supportive.

Dad, Mom.

678
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,210
I've been thinking.

679
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,120
Tonight is a new beginning for Pop's.
And...

680
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,710
Maybe it can be for us, too.

681
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,460
That's up to you,<i> mija.</i>

If that's what you want.

total transparency, okay?

685
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,000
From now on.

686
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
In the spirit of
that, I propose that

687
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,920
Lodge Industries make a
charitable contribution.

I'm sure they're
just here to enjoy

burgers and service.

692

lice off each other.

I lied under oath for you. And
thank God I'm quick on my feet.

thank you.

699
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,000
Honor your promise to me.

700
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,420
[sighs]

701
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,790
Boo!

702
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,540
Hi, Midge, Moose.

703
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,210
I've got your jingle-jangle.

704
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,380
[camera shutter clicks]

705
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,790
[Pop] I<i> gotta put
her on the spot.</i>

706
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,290
It's thanks to this
young lady here

707
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,750
that Pop's gets to stay
open tonight, tomorrow...

708
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,080
As long as you
folks keep coming.

709
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,880
[crowd cheers and applauds]

710
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:53,420
Thanks, also, to
the Lodge family

711
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,420
for a donation they just made

712
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,210
that gives us a little cushion

713
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,250
to weather any storm
that might come up.

714
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,420
I didn't know we were in
the charity business.

715
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,500
Oh, we're not.

716
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,420
As of five minutes ago,
we, uh, own this diner.

717
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,620
In exchange for silence, I told
Tate he could stay on as manager.

718
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,420
-Nice to have you back, Hiram.
-[chuckles]

719
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,620
Hermione, thank you for
saying you wrote that letter.

720
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,210
Veronica never would have
forgiven me for that.

721
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,460
Once again, your loyalty
knows no bounds.

722
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,670
Ronnie, should I introduce
myself to your dad?

723
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,790
You've faced enough
dragons for one night.

724
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,580
Next time, Archiekins.

725
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,960
So, I guess tonight is a
win for the good guys.

726
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,380
A rare win, but, yes.

727
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,880
Thanks to you, Betty.

728
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,330
You okay?

729
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,880
I'm here with you guys.

730
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,620
So, yeah. I think so.

731
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,500
[Cheryl] I have a
present for you.

732
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,580
The video of Daddy and Jason.

733
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,500
All cued up.

734
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,040
It might bring you peace.

735
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,880
[man] Evening, Mr.
and Mrs. Lodge.

736
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,250
You must be Veronica.

737
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,380
I am. Where's Smithers?

738
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,250
Oh, he didn't tell you?

739
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,210
His mother fell ill so he went
home overseas to care for her.

740
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,580
Did he leave a
forwarding address?

741
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,880
I'll try to track one down, sir.

742
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,210
Thank you, Andre.

743
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,170
[cell phone ringing]

744
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,420
Hello?

745
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,790
You went to see Penny Peabody?

746
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,710
<i> You asked her for help?</i>

747
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,710
Dad, hey...

748
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,380
Yeah, well, we didn't have a choice.
Why, is something wrong?

749
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,750
Did you pay her?

750
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,710
No, she said it was a favor.

751
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,540
[FP]<i> Jughead, listen to me.</i>

752
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,380
Do not contact her again.

753
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,920
If she reaches out,
don't respond.

754
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,580
You do not want to be in bed
with the Snake Charmer.

755
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,750
Why? Dad--

756
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,250
You do know that several drug
deals went down here tonight.

757
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,620
What?

758
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,120
And if you think
that Hiram Lodge,

759
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,920
Riverdale's answer to Scarface,

760
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,380
helped Pop Tate for
altruistic reasons,

761
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,250
I have a bridge to sell you.

762
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,000
Mom...

763
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,960
The Serpents have now
officially crossed the tracks

764
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,670
and have a toehold
on the north side.

765
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,460
So, congratulations, Betty.

766
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,920
You're almost
single-handedly responsible

767
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,830
for giving crime a
haven in Riverdale.

768
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,960
[bell jingling]

769
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,250
[Jughead] <i> And far from the
glow of Pop's neon sign,</i>

770
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,290
<i> on Sweetwater Bridge,</i>

771
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,960
<i> Archie Andrews had arranged
a secret rendezvous</i>

772
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,620
<i> with Dilton Doiley.</i>

773
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,540
Hey, Dilton.

774
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Hey, Archie.

775
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,880
Got what you asked for.

776
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,500
I'm not crazy.

777
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,000
The guy's still out there.
It's just for protection.

778
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,290
Sure, Archie. Whatever you say.

779
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,500
[Jughead]<i> That night, for
the first time in weeks,</i>

780
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,040
<i> Archie would sleep.</i>

781
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,670
<i> Before waking up the next
morning to a living nightmare.</i>

782
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,960
[Midge] Bottoms up.

783
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,580
[giggles]

784
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,920
Oh, wait, wait.

785
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,040
I think there's
somebody out there.

786
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,250
No, don't. He'll see us.

787
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,040
[gunshots]
