Now, Pop Tate had a fairly
good idea of what happened

162
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:08,749
up until when your father was shot.

163

And then, well...

164

There are some gaps. And I
need you to help me fill those.

What did he do, our masked man?

166

After he shot my dad?

He...

169
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,856
Nothing. He shot my dad,
ran out of the diner.

170
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:36,877
Who did this, Sheriff?

Archie, it's just... It's
too early to speculate.

172

But this guy, he was probably out of
his head on meth or the jingle jangle,

173

some Southside lowlife that was just

174

looking for a cash grab.

175
00:08:48,124 --> 00:08:50,090
How much did he get? How much cash?

176

257
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:44,278

were working for Fred Andrews

00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:49,790
when, for reasons of his own, he
decided to let them go suddenly.

Maybe someone took it
personally and went rogue.

I took your dad's things out
of the bag. I hope that's okay.

328

I'm not sure.

330
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,199
That's all that was in there.

331
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,434
It would've been in his coat.

332

- Are you sure you didn't see it?
- I didn't.

333
00:17:57,441 --> 00:18:00,640
Maybe it was in the truck?
Or back at the hospital?

334
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:03,444
No, this is... this is everything
they had. You heard the nurse.

335
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:07,414
Okay, well, worst case
scenario, it's just a wallet.

336

Everything that is important
to my dad is in that watlet.

340

He asked me to come be here

Well, that's gonna be traumatizing

We're thinking it might be at Pop's.

That, or the guy who
shot Fred might have it.

382
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:17,576
Well, if it was just
some rando robbing Pop's,

383
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:20,147
then he probably took the money
and then got rid of the wallet.

What? Is that an actual theory?

387
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,622
Not according to Sheriff Keller,

388
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:31,658
but if you ask me, people have grudges.

389
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,894
People have enemies. I
mean, think of where we live.

It's entirely conceivable
this was a hit.

a hit.

409

But who would be evil
enough to do thatthnd why?

410
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:53,540
But then I remembered how you wanted

411
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:56,382
Fred to sell his share of the
company back to you and Daddy

412
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:58,823
because he and Daddy
wouldn't get along.

413
00:22:58,826 --> 00:23:01,281
Which is a threat,
if I ever heard one.

414
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:04,751
And because you are so determined
to paint your father as a villain,

415
00:23:04,753 --> 00:23:07,854
you assume he must have
put a hit on Fred Andrews.

416
00:23:07,857 --> 00:23:09,390
Brilliant.

417

You.

Talking about how if Freddy Andrews

659
00:37:58,772 --> 00:38:01,316
was gonna let Hiram
Lodge's bitch run the show,

660
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:03,644
fire his crew, then it's
good he was gut-shot.

661
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:05,715
So we thought we might press him a bit.

662
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:07,063
See if it was all just talk.

663
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:08,680
- And?
- And...

664
00:38:08,682 --> 00:38:11,916
after a lengthy
cross-examination, yeah,

665
00:38:11,918 --> 00:38:14,652
we've concluded, he was
just being a loudmouth.

666
00:38:14,655 --> 00:38:16,988
<b><font color="#00FFFF">(stutters)</font></b> What did
you bring him here for

667
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,223
if he didn't even do anything?

668
00:38:18,225 --> 00:38:20,792
So you could see we'd
done what you asked.

669
00:38:20,795 --> 00:38:23,630
So you could tell your old
man. That's important to us.

670

With or without the jacket,

671
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:28,372
you're a Serpent.

You have no idea.

00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:15,606
Have you?

685
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,804
Not so much that I still don't
want a kiss hello from my daughter.

686
00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:40,344
By the way, in case either
of you were wondering,

687
00:39:40,347 --> 00:39:42,006
Mr. Andrews woke up.

688
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,552
He's going to make it.

689
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:47,335
I know we're all
really happy about that.
