1
00:00:01,562 --> 00:00:03,036
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,527
He calls himself the Black Hood.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,031
It's like the angel of
death had come to Riverdale.

4
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,333
A family of four was murdered.

5
00:00:12,736 --> 00:00:14,406
There was a third child.

6
00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:16,338
Do you know who killed your family?

7
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:18,460
A preacher, passing through town.

8
00:00:18,463 --> 00:00:19,815
A group of men killed him.

9
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:21,183
Justice had been served.

10
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,146
I know all about the Snake Charmer.

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,814
If you cross the stink,

12
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,882
I will make sure that video goes
straight to the Sheriff's office.

13
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:30,251
I love you, Ronnie.

14
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:33,491
Archie, whatever
deep-seated issues I have,

15
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:35,351
I can't let myself go there with you.

16
00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:37,828
How many times are we
gonna push each other away?

17
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:52,169
Used to be, in ye olden days,

18
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:54,342
every December, a Lord of Misrule

19
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,478
presided over the winter holidays,

20
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:59,578
called back then, the Feast of Fools.

21
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:01,790
What do you say, Pop? Is it okay?

22
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:03,679
The best tree yet.

23
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:05,460
Thanks, Archie, thanks, Fred.

24
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:06,809
Oh, no. Thank you, Pop,

25
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:09,585
for letting us set up shop
right in front of your diner.

26
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:15,214
You guys gonna stay in town for break?

27
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:17,390
Yeah. We were gonna visit my mom,

28
00:01:17,393 --> 00:01:19,609
but she booked a single's cruise so...

29
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,336
How are you and Veronica?

30
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,004
We've been better.

31
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:25,773
If it's any consolation,

32
00:01:25,776 --> 00:01:28,082
Betty and I aren't in the
greatest of places, either.

33
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:29,876
Jughead, you want a Christmas
tree, you and your dad?

34
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:30,661
On the house.

35
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:32,859
It'll have to be a small one, Mr. A.

36
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:36,096
So, I'll see you at
Kevin's Secret Santa thing?

37
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:38,820
Yeah. Because that
sounds like a great idea.

38
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:43,406
So Christmas was happening,

39
00:01:44,528 --> 00:01:47,221
even though this year's Lord of Misrule

40
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:49,679
was none other than the Black Hood.

41
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:54,803
Betty.

42
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:56,794
- Wake up, it's time.
- Polly.

43
00:01:56,797 --> 00:01:58,872
- He's here, he's waiting for us.
- What? Who?

44
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,408
You know who. Come on.

45
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:08,531
Merry Christmas.

46
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:10,695
Hey, Merry Christmas.

47
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:14,606
- Betty.
- Betty, Merry Christmas.

48
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:18,459
- Okay.
- All right, honey, I told you like...

49
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:19,527
Santa?

50
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,709
- Where's Jason's stocking?
- I couldn't find it.

51
00:02:47,712 --> 00:02:51,251
And anyway, there's
nothing to put in it.

52
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,590
And what, pray tell, is this?

53
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:59,413
It's going to be a Hard Candy
Christmas this year, Cheryl.

54
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,237
Time to face facts. We have no money.

55
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,977
Dad, what is that? A
letter from the Black Hood?

56
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:09,365
No, it's worse.

57
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:12,798
Riverdale General. My hospital bill.

58
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:13,942
How much is it for?

59
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:17,672
- Eighty-six thousand.
- What, dollars?

60
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:20,535
That can't be right, can it?
Or doesn't your insurance...

61
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:23,773
They probably made a mistake.
I'll call them tomorrow.

62
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:28,387
Kevin's Secret Santa had
a strict $20 limit, V.

63
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,114
Kevin needs to relax.

64
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:33,590
Also, these aren't just
for Secret Santa, obvi.

65
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:35,659
I got an Hermes scarf for my mom,

66
00:03:35,662 --> 00:03:39,684
a leather passport case for my
dad, now that he can travel again,

67
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,491
and a little something for my best girl.

68
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:47,129
And a bauble for Archie.

69
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:49,332
Because you're getting back together?

70
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:51,466
Because it was purchased pre-breakup.

71
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:53,869
And haven't you heard?
We're still friends.

72
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:55,103
Oh, yeah.

73
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:56,605
Isn't everyone?

74
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:01,677
I was thinking about our Penny problem.

75
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,660
My problem, not ours.

76
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:07,129
Well, I am the one she has
on camera delivering drugs.

77
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:09,818
How I deal with Peabody
is not your concern.

78
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:11,153
I'm handling it.

79
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:13,622
By pimping the Serpents
out as drug runners?

80
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:14,856
Boy!

81
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:19,661
Toss them in the corner.

82
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:21,029
Hey, what's in the bags, Tall Boy?

83
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,698
Hey, what did I just say?

84
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:25,274
Mind your damn business
and get to school.

85
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,816
Veronica, it's your turn.

86
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:36,345
Hmm.

87
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:42,117
Oh. A gift certificate
for a couples' massage.

88
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:45,143
Thanks, Josie.

89
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:48,190
You can go with Betty, or your mom...

90
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:50,025
Or I can go with your mom, if you want.

91
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:52,574
Oh, dear God, can we please
get this torture over with?

92
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:54,981
Betty, you're next and mercifully last.

93
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:58,910
Well, I think I know who picked my
name based on these wrapping skills.

94
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:04,940
Archie...

95
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:07,723
My dad and I were cleaning
out the garage and I found it.

96
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:10,543
Swiss Family Robinson?

97
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:14,080
Yeah, It's this old read-a-long record

98
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,550
we used to listen to
when we were, like, five.

99
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:17,819
Oh, my God.

100
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:19,921
I love it, Arch. Thank you.

101
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:21,757
Hey, Merry Christmas.

102
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,392
- Moose.
- Hi.

103
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,817
Why are you rushing off?

104
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,520
Look, Betty,

105
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:33,635
I don't wanna be that guy,

106
00:05:33,638 --> 00:05:35,036
but I see Moose,

107
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:36,304
all I think about is the Black Hood

108
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:39,007
and the pain he's caused
to the people I care about,

109
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,475
including you.

110
00:05:40,477 --> 00:05:41,510
I know.

111
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:43,311
And the fact that he's still out there

112
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:45,046
is giving me anxiety nightmares,

113
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:46,348
making me paranoid.

114
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:49,885
Like, everywhere I look, all I see is...

115
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,975
What?

116
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,378
All you see is what?

117
00:05:57,127 --> 00:05:58,760
Excuse me. Who are you?

118
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,005
You mean, my name?

119
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:04,885
Uh, where's Mr. Svenson?

120
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:08,426
No idea. He's been out a few days,

121
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:10,138
they just called me in.

122
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:20,115
Arch, you and Veronica
confronted Mr. Svenson

123
00:06:20,117 --> 00:06:21,814
about his connection to the Black Hood.

124
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:23,051
And now he's not here.

125
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:27,025
What if something happened to him?

126
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:29,981
Betty, we found out
Mr. Svenson's secret...

127
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:32,207
What if we led the
Black Hood right to him?

128
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,942
What if we got him killed?

129
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,778
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

130
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:44,103
Mr. Svenson?

131
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:46,947
He's been out all week with a cold.

132
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,885
Sounded terrible on the phone.

133
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:53,643
So, I dropped off some chicken
soup at his house a few days back.

134
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,961
You saw him?

135
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:56,596
I left it at his door.

136
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:58,572
But between us,

137
00:06:58,575 --> 00:07:01,971
he often gets this way
during the holidays.

138
00:07:01,974 --> 00:07:03,702
You know, depressed.

139
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:04,971
No family.

140
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:09,008
Thank you.

141
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:14,614
Hey.

142
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:18,217
I... stayed behind

143
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:20,820
because Merry Christmas.

144
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:23,990
Thank you.

145
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,273
I'm kinda sorry

146
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:30,997
for how it all went down between us.

147
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:35,802
The Serpents, my dad and I
specifically are in a precarious place.

148
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:37,036
I...

149
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,205
I just don't want you
in those crosshairs.

150
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:41,074
That's not your decision
to make, Jughead.

151
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:46,012
Even if you think it's to
protect me, it's my choice,

152
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,705
what I risk and for whom.

153
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,908
I know.

154
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:53,803
I should go. Check on my dad.

155
00:07:54,522 --> 00:07:55,722
Jug.

156
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,736
I got you something, too.

157
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,640
Archie.

158
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:17,577
I got you a little something.

159
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,646
Thanks.

160
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,513
- I didn't realize...
- Oh, no, no.

161
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:22,882
It's all good. Just open it.

162
00:08:26,736 --> 00:08:28,788
- Ronnie, this is...
- Turn it over.

163
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:32,241
I got it before...

164
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:36,591
I don't want things to
be forced between us.

165
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,932
What?

166
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,924
No. Did I... Did I make it worse?

167
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:44,315
I just, I wanted you to know
that I still care about...

168
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:45,350
No, you didn't.

169
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:48,866
Things at home aren't great right now.

170
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:51,511
It's my dad.

171
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:54,714
Anything I can do to help?

172
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:58,315
Come on.

173
00:08:58,318 --> 00:08:59,786
We're still friends.

174
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:03,222
He just, he got his
hospital bill and he owes

175
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:06,825
$86,000, Ronnie,

176
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:10,007
and it's like we are
selling Christmas trees,

177
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,877
just for extra money so we
can keep our heads above water.

178
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,261
Oh, my God, Archie.

179
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,452
I want to help.

180
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:20,606
- I want to hug you.
- That's okay.

181
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:23,009
I shouldn't have said anything.

182
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:24,911
The watch is great, Ronnie. Thank you.

183
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:26,212
Yeah.

184
00:09:27,348 --> 00:09:28,781
<i>What is all this?</i>

185
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:30,650
It's a Serpent tradition.

186
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,159
Every year, we give
back to the Southside.

187
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:34,728
Toys for Tots. Meals on Wheels,

188
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:36,770
kids and old folks living alone.

189
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:38,172
The Hells Angels do it.

190
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:40,774
I'm always down for charitable works.

191
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:42,143
Hey, have you seen my dad?

192
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:43,346
Why aren't you in school?

193
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:46,032
It's a half-day before break.

194
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:48,924
Well, in that case, you can
hold down the fort here, Jug.

195
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:51,038
Or I could come with you guys.

196
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,105
Nice try. The answer's no.

197
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:55,236
We do need another set of hands, boss.

198
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,742
There you go.

199
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:58,460
Let me pull my weight.

200
00:09:58,463 --> 00:09:59,912
Dad...

201
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:04,566
I don't know what the Snake
Charmer has you doing...

202
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:07,080
Sweet Pea, you're with us.

203
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:24,070
Hey, Betty, what's up?

204
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:27,273
Hey, I can't let this Svenson thing go.

205
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:29,675
I think we should stop by
his house and check up on him.

206
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:30,955
Yeah, I agree.

207
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,958
Let me just tell my dad and we'll go.

208
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:34,928
- Give me ten.
- All right.

209
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:39,252
Teen Paul Bunyan, I'd like
to purchase your finest tree.

210
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:41,254
Actually, Cheryl, I was
just about to take a break,

211
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:43,130
but Vic here can help you. Vic.

212
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,918
What can I get you, miss?

213
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:48,815
We've got some nice spruces.

214
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:05,211
Well, there's the chicken soup.

215
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:10,516
Mr. Svenson?

216
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:29,483
Can I help you?

217
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:30,803
Jughead Jones?

218
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,172
Maybe.

219
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:35,748
I'm Jack Walsh, your
dad's parole officer.

220
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:37,410
He's not home.

221
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:38,811
Doesn't need to be.

222
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:41,134
Do you mind if I come in for a moment?

223
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:43,082
Like I have a choice.

224
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:49,455
Hiram. Was that a Spiffany's bag I saw

225
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:51,733
coming through the lobby earlier today?

226
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:54,127
It looked about the right
size for a <i>Glamerge</i> egg.

227
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,320
That depends, mi amore. Have

228
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:56,893
you been naughty or nice this year?

229
00:11:59,534 --> 00:12:01,890
Don't worry, mi hija.
Santa has your list, too.

230
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:05,400
And please, don't go snooping for
the gifts this year. He hates that.

231
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:08,069
Santa can rip up my list for all I care.

232
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:11,777
I mean, look at us, throwing
money away on bejeweled eggs

233
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,946
like we're a family of Russian oligarchs

234
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:15,347
when there are people in this town

235
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,875
who can't even pay
their own medical bills.

236
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:18,710
And since when are you a communist?

237
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:21,454
Since Archie told me that he and his dad

238
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:23,522
are drowning in Fred's medical bills.

239
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,575
To the tune of $86,000.

240
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:28,361
Which is why I was thinking...

241
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:30,497
- Absolutely not.
- Sweetheart, that's a lot of money.

242
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,637
The Lodge Charitable Trust has made
its donations for the fiscal year.

243
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,419
Fred Andrews will have
to tighten his belt.

244
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,676
Said Ebenezer Scrooge.

245
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,574
Fred's selling Christmas
trees for extra cash, Dad.

246
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:44,880
I mean, that's the kind of
man, the kind of father he is.

247
00:12:44,883 --> 00:12:46,282
You know,

248
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:50,349
I believe I've some work
to finish in my study.

249
00:12:57,817 --> 00:13:01,061
Cheryl Marjorie Blossom,
what have you done?

250
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:02,809
Isn't it obvious, Mother?

251
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:04,630
I've saved Christmas.

252
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,493
Look how happy Nana Rose is.

253
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:11,003
You spoiled, wretched little brat,

254
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:13,173
how do you expect to pay for all this?

255
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:15,006
Oh.

256
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:16,634
I was thinking

257
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:19,678
maybe you could go to
Mr. Lodge for a job?

258
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:22,214
Of course, he'd probably
ask what skills you have,

259
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:25,184
and you'd be forced to admit
that the only skill you have

260
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:27,086
is being a terrible mother.

261
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:30,916
So, I guess you're going to have
to get creative in the New Year.

262
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,169
You should've drowned them at birth,

263
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:39,598
like a basket of kittens.

264
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:57,116
Mom?

265
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,717
Dad?

266
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:00,619
Hey.

267
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:03,456
Hey.

268
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:05,548
How are you?

269
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:08,260
I'm fine. I just iced
some gingerbread cookies,

270
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:09,829
Polly's favorite, just in case

271
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:11,964
there's a Christmas
miracle and she comes home.

272
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,768
Oh, by the way, there was
a gift for you on the steps.

273
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,403
Your Secret Santa.

274
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:19,205
I took it up to your room.

275
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:23,726
Secret Santa?

276
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:49,227
"Enclosed is a finger that belongs
to the sinner Joseph Conway..."

277
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,468
He's talking about Mr. Svenson.

278
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:53,936
"You have one final trespass to unearth.

279
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:56,672
Find the truth, reveal it to the town,

280
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:58,580
and you will perhaps save his life."

281
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,526
He kidnapped Mr. Svenson, Arch,

282
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,913
and now he's mutilating him.

283
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,330
Arch, Arch. Hey.

284
00:15:10,121 --> 00:15:13,488
Betty, please.

285
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:15,104
Mr. Svenson? Is that you?

286
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,182
It is, Betty, but his
name is Joseph Conway.

287
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,948
He's lost a lot of blood.

288
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:24,333
Though it's nothing compared to
the blood on the hands of this town.

289
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:25,773
Exhume the past.

290
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:28,178
Find where the primal sin was committed

291
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:31,180
and you'll find the
sinner Conway, maybe alive.

292
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:32,675
And, as always, don't...

293
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:35,877
What, you maniac? Don't
tell Sheriff Keller?

294
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:40,557
Archie, what sin?

295
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,130
What could Mr. Svenson
possibly be guilty of?

296
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:44,695
Veronica and I talked to him.

297
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:48,002
Betty, his entire family was
murdered by some crazy preacher.

298
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:50,957
Well, maybe the people who adopted
him know something that we don't.

299
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,260
Wait, wait, Betty.
Before he was adopted,

300
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:54,976
Mr. Svenson lived as Joseph Conway

301
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:56,324
at the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

302
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:57,799
Would they talk to us?

303
00:15:57,802 --> 00:15:59,456
They better.

304
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,915
Merry Christmas, Mom.

305
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:52,418
Pop's?

306
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,204
Did you open them?

307
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:23,002
No, Dad. Out of respect for you.

308
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:26,859
But your parole officer, Mr.
Walsh, he sure was curious.

309
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:28,561
- Walsh was here?
- Yeah.

310
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:29,995
Don't worry, I got rid of him.

311
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:31,528
But he already has heard that the

312
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:33,465
Serpents are moving
into narcos territory.

313
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,602
Ta-da.

314
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:41,971
Gift boxes.

315
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:46,010
- With drugs in them?
- No, with gifts in them.

316
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:48,620
For you, your mom, and Jellybean.

317
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:51,460
Christmas day, I thought
we'd take a ride to Toledo

318
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:52,896
and deliver them in person.

319
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:57,784
Dad, this isn't going to work.

320
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,719
Today, it's gifts.

321
00:17:59,722 --> 00:18:04,257
Tomorrow, it's drugs or
weapons or God knows what.

322
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,925
And how long this is going to go on for?

323
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:07,360
As long as Penny wants.

324
00:18:07,363 --> 00:18:10,563
And if her favors keep getting
bigger which you know that they will,

325
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:12,765
what happens when she asks
for more Serpents in on this?

326
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:15,095
Then I'll bring more Serpents!

327
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:17,336
You know what?

328
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:19,198
You are right. This isn't going to work.

329
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:22,574
You and I living together, so maybe
you can go back to Fred's or to Betty's.

330
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:24,042
Betty? I split with Betty...

331
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:26,628
Well then, what do you want me to say?

332
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:29,115
I just want you to let me help

333
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:30,917
fix this mess that I made.

334
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,128
Get this through your
thick skull, Jughead.

335
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:34,520
We are trapped.

336
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:36,222
We've got no leverage.

337
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:39,902
If that means I gotta be Penny's
dancing monkey for the time being,

338
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:41,594
then that's how it goes.

339
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,631
Let me get some rest.

340
00:18:45,634 --> 00:18:47,681
I have a long night ahead of me.

341
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:50,251
Yes, hello.

342
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:54,540
I'm calling to settle an
account for one of your patients,

343
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:56,075
Fred Andrews.

344
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,240
Of course. I'm his business partner.

345
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:01,930
Uh-huh.

346
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,511
I'd like to pay the bill in
full and keep it anonymous,

347
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:07,153
an angel donation.

348
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,179
Yes, I'm aware of the amount.

349
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:12,458
My name?

350
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,974
Hermione Apollonia Lodge.

351
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:18,485
And it's a Black American Excess card.

352
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:22,635
Number 2-9-5-7-2-3-0...

353
00:19:22,638 --> 00:19:25,019
Penny Peabody has got
my dad dealing drugs.

354
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,578
I know this,

355
00:19:27,581 --> 00:19:29,867
'cause she had me doing it before him.

356
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:34,565
Now, she's roped in
Tall Boy and Sweet Pea.

357
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:36,690
Man, if you're pissed because your
old man tapped me instead of you...

358
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,458
No, Sweet Pea.

359
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:40,542
I'm pissed because I don't want the

360
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:42,738
Serpents to end up like the Ghoulies.

361
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:44,991
And I doubt that any
of you became Serpent

362
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:48,333
just to be at the beck and
call of a drug queen pin.

363
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:50,463
I know where this ends.

364
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:53,065
Death. Jail.

365
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:58,137
Which is why in the interest
of self-preservation,

366
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:01,440
we have to take out Penny.

367
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,505
Snake Charmer's helped some of us.

368
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:06,012
Oh, yeah?

369
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,086
And what did she ask for
in return, Sweet Pea, huh?

370
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:10,489
How many favors?

371
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:13,186
Now, if we don't stop Penny tonight,

372
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:19,492
she is going to get every single
one of us in on this. I promise you.

373
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:21,218
I promise you, Sweet Pea.

374
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:27,080
What I am asking is, are you
willing to risk your necks

375
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,001
to save my dad's life?

376
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:33,949
What is the first law?

377
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:36,365
No Serpent stands alone.

378
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,148
I'm in.

379
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:43,549
Me, too.

380
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:47,553
Let's do this.

381
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:55,314
Joseph Conway.

382
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:57,463
Joseph Svenson, as you know him,

383
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,899
was a troubled youth.
There was no saving him.

384
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:01,200
Meaning he was a sinner?

385
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:02,702
No, he was a child, a victim.

386
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:05,204
Did he suffer from survivor's guilt?

387
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:10,910
I've already said too much.

388
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:12,693
- No.
- Betty.

389
00:21:13,768 --> 00:21:15,583
Sister Woodhouse,

390
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:18,718
when my sister escaped this dungeon,

391
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:21,476
she told me all about
the corporeal punishment.

392
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:24,648
So please, help us with this

393
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:27,765
or I'll expose the
Sisters of Quiet Mercy

394
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:31,125
for the house of horrors
that it really is.

395
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:36,135
After his family was massacred,

396
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:38,537
young Conway, young Svenson,

397
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,873
identified the man responsible.

398
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:44,840
Then, a small group
of Riverdale's citizens

399
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:46,846
took matters into their own hands

400
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:50,716
and, well, executed him.

401
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:53,853
It was only later when he was with us,

402
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,722
that Joseph admitted that
in his terror and shock,

403
00:21:56,724 --> 00:21:59,648
he may have pointed a
finger of accusation...

404
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,926
At the wrong man?

405
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:03,614
Oh, my God.

406
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:06,961
Svenson's sin was sentencing
the wrong man to death.

407
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,236
Did Svenson, did Conway

408
00:22:10,238 --> 00:22:13,304
ever talk about who
carried out the execution?

409
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:18,236
They came here once, to see Joseph.

410
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:21,480
It was a group of men and one woman.

411
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:23,983
I don't know their names

412
00:22:23,986 --> 00:22:26,619
and I can't remember
what they look like.

413
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:30,931
Just that the woman had
the most striking hair,

414
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,875
white, save for a cherry-red stripe.

415
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,299
Nana Rose Blossom?

416
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:50,911
FP?

417
00:22:50,914 --> 00:22:52,682
Well, you're early, Old Hoss.

418
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,375
Penny.

419
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:01,691
Ho-merry-ho.

420
00:23:01,694 --> 00:23:04,265
Jughead Jones.

421
00:23:04,268 --> 00:23:06,196
Nice crowbar.

422
00:23:06,797 --> 00:23:10,086
This? Yeah, I brought it in case
I needed to pry the door open.

423
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,586
Well, are you gonna give
me hand with this stuff?

424
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:16,734
Your dad will be here in
like what, 15, 20 minutes.

425
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:19,216
He probably won't be too
happy to see you, huh?

426
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:21,289
I wouldn't worry about that.

427
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:23,146
Neither of us are going to be here.

428
00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:28,985
Is this suppose to scare me?

429
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,398
I would not do this if I were you.

430
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:34,695
You are making a big mistake.

431
00:23:34,698 --> 00:23:37,166
You are making a...

432
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:43,733
Hey, guys.

433
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:47,571
Finishing up some last minute shopping?

434
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:52,576
We were, but then we got the most
fascinating call from our bank,

435
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:55,745
confirming a charge that
was made to my credit card

436
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:57,848
in the amount of $86,000.

437
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:01,231
Oh, so that went through.

438
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:02,934
Great.

439
00:24:02,937 --> 00:24:07,390
Yeah, I decided that you would
cover Fred's medical expenses.

440
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:10,867
I mean, if you can afford to buy Pop's,

441
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,750
and then lie to my face about it.

442
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:18,235
So, how is it that we can now
suddenly afford an entire diner?

443
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:24,708
You wanted a more active
role in Lodge Industries

444
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,042
and we let you have it.

445
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:28,478
Then you break into my office

446
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,881
and try to use whatever
you find as leverage?

447
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:33,450
Now, I admit, there's
a lot you don't know

448
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:34,828
and that's on purpose.

449
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:38,054
How can I be part of this family
if you keep hiding things from me?

450
00:24:38,057 --> 00:24:40,729
Mija, you think you want to
know everything, but you don't.

451
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:44,861
My name is on all of those
documents in your desk, Daddy,

452
00:24:44,864 --> 00:24:46,859
doesn't that mean I
have the right to know?

453
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:50,031
Yes. Yes, it does, Veronica.

454
00:24:50,918 --> 00:24:54,632
But that means the time for
being Daddy's little girl is over.

455
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:57,207
It's time to work now,

456
00:24:57,983 --> 00:25:01,066
all of us, in lockstep.

457
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:02,702
She deserves to know the truth, Hiram.

458
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:06,716
All right.

459
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:09,586
All right.

460
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:11,755
Follow me into the study.

461
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,034
Where am I?

462
00:25:24,036 --> 00:25:25,068
You're in Greendale.

463
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:27,437
Your new home.

464
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:30,499
But frankly, Penny,

465
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:33,043
I don't care where you set up shop.

466
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:36,716
But it's not gonna be in Riverdale

467
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:39,349
and it's not going to be with Serpents.

468
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:41,051
You want to deal drugs,

469
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:44,491
you want to extort people,
that's your business.

470
00:25:45,495 --> 00:25:46,961
But not on the Southside.

471
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:48,425
That belongs to us.

472
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:53,194
You stupid, cocky kid.

473
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,755
Serpent law says you
can't hurt one of your own.

474
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,757
Oh, Penny, it's time you learned.

475
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,842
Grab her.

476
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:09,512
What are you doing?

477
00:26:09,515 --> 00:26:10,947
Get off of me.

478
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,782
Get off of me!

479
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:16,421
That tattoo doesn't make you a Serpent.

480
00:26:17,956 --> 00:26:19,089
No!

481
00:26:25,055 --> 00:26:27,288
Cheryl, we need to see your grandmother.

482
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,567
Nana Rose seldom has
visitors. She'll be pleased.

483
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,935
Entree.

484
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:38,170
Nana Rose, we have
some questions for you

485
00:26:38,173 --> 00:26:41,327
about something that happened
in Riverdale a long time ago.

486
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,481
A man killed this family

487
00:26:44,484 --> 00:26:47,584
and a group of people decided to
take justice into their own hands.

488
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:48,852
Oh, dear.

489
00:26:48,855 --> 00:26:51,551
Here in Riverdale?

490
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:53,340
Yes.

491
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:56,326
And you were a part of
that group, weren't you?

492
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:58,233
What is this, a Christmas inquest?

493
00:26:58,236 --> 00:27:00,327
Cheryl, a man's life is at stake.

494
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,333
Were you with this group when they...

495
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:06,770
When you killed this man for revenge?

496
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:08,470
Oh, no.

497
00:27:08,473 --> 00:27:10,626
No girls allowed.

498
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:15,645
They told me to stay at home while
they took care of the bad man.

499
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:20,517
Nana Rose,

500
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,453
this is so important.

501
00:27:23,456 --> 00:27:26,256
Where did they hang the bad man?

502
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:28,985
Oh, they didn't hang him.

503
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:32,262
Oh, no. They gave him a proper burial.

504
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:37,543
Buried him alive.

505
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,702
Where?

506
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:41,371
Where did they do that?

507
00:27:41,374 --> 00:27:45,974
Ask your grandfather,
Polly dear, he was there.

508
00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:48,111
My, my grandfather?

509
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:51,247
I had a picture of them,

510
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,283
smiling at the place.

511
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:58,118
Standing under the Devil's Hand.

512
00:27:58,121 --> 00:28:00,924
Picture? What picture?

513
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:03,359
Cheryl.

514
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:06,896
I wonder if you might
take me to my room.

515
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:10,233
I suddenly feel quite ill.

516
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:12,335
Satisfied, you vultures?

517
00:28:12,338 --> 00:28:14,391
Your reindeer games are over.

518
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:16,106
Now get the hell out.

519
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:21,735
Archie, my grandfather
helped murder an innocent man.

520
00:28:21,738 --> 00:28:24,147
Betty, who even knows if
what she was saying is true.

521
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:26,082
That picture Nana Rose mentioned,

522
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:28,318
when Grandpa Louis died,
we packed up his house

523
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:30,871
and we donated most of his
stuff but he had pictures,

524
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:32,753
and we kept them and we organized them.

525
00:28:32,756 --> 00:28:34,806
Okay, Betty, take a breath, where
are they? Where are the pictures?

526
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:36,092
My house. They are at my house.

527
00:28:36,094 --> 00:28:37,660
- That's great.
- Archie,

528
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:43,501
my grandfather killed a man
in cold blood, an innocent man.

529
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:46,169
What if that's why he
picked me, the Black Hood?

530
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:47,704
That's why he has been calling me.

531
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:50,507
- Revenge for something I didn't even do...
- Betty, listen to me.

532
00:28:51,776 --> 00:28:55,719
This is the part where we end this.

533
00:28:55,722 --> 00:28:59,136
Where we save Mr. Svenson and
stop the Black Hood tonight.

534
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:00,638
But I need you with me.

535
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:02,252
I can't do this alone.

536
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:03,451
Tomorrow, we're gonna wake up,

537
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:05,655
and everything is gonna
go back to how it was,

538
00:29:05,657 --> 00:29:08,091
but right now, I need you with me.

539
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:10,360
- I need Betty Cooper.
- Archie.

540
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:19,298
Betty.

541
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:20,904
We have to hurry.

542
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:40,820
Well, Veronica, now you know.

543
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:42,122
You know everyveing.

544
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,791
So, mija, what do you think?

545
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,162
I'm in.

546
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:53,133
But I have ground rules.

547
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:56,169
Well, one ground rule.

548
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,305
By all means.

549
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:01,508
I refuse to do anything illegal.

550
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:03,009
Well, that's fine,

551
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:06,419
especially since we're not
doing anything illegal either.

552
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:09,850
Let me share two words to live by.

553
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:13,119
"Plausible deniability."

554
00:30:13,122 --> 00:30:15,180
Also,

555
00:30:15,183 --> 00:30:18,191
that charge I made for
Fred's medical bills?

556
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:19,993
I want that to stick.

557
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:23,011
Mija, it's gonna complicate
matters, Fred's a proud man.

558
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:25,215
- He's not...
- We'll smooth that over, though.

559
00:30:25,218 --> 00:30:28,568
And the truth is, we'll need
Fred for what comes next.

560
00:30:29,137 --> 00:30:30,170
Fine.

561
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:33,273
Assuming the Fred
situation can be finessed,

562
00:30:35,077 --> 00:30:36,376
do we have a deal?

563
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:38,745
We do, Daddykins.

564
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:41,615
We have a deal.

565
00:30:45,787 --> 00:30:46,887
Hey, Dad.

566
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,941
What's all this?

567
00:30:47,944 --> 00:30:51,224
This is a celebratory dinner.

568
00:30:53,629 --> 00:30:55,996
Penny didn't show up for
your pick up, did she?

569
00:30:56,824 --> 00:30:58,477
No.

570
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,568
No, she didn't. Why? Do you
know something about that?

571
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:03,970
She's gone, Dad.

572
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:06,273
I rallied the younger Serpents,

573
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:07,902
we drove her out of Riverdale.

574
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:09,652
And I got my pound of
flesh in the process.

575
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:12,621
Are you nuts? She will be
back, you better believe that.

576
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:14,090
She won't!

577
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:16,238
I was very persuasive.

578
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,761
And even if she does,

579
00:31:18,764 --> 00:31:20,287
we will take care of it.

580
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:23,446
You and me, and the other Serpents.

581
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,261
- In unity, there's strength.
- Oh, God.

582
00:31:25,264 --> 00:31:27,177
That's the sixth law.
While you were in jail,

583
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,770
I recited that every
day, I lived by that.

584
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:33,166
You want to take my jacket?

585
00:31:33,168 --> 00:31:35,835
You want to relegate me
to Toys for Tots, fine.

586
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:39,196
But I am still a Serpent, Dad, and this,

587
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:41,708
this life that you
wanted to protect me from,

588
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:44,844
I'm proud of this.

589
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:49,707
I'm proud of who I am.

590
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,172
You can't take that away from me.

591
00:31:54,723 --> 00:31:57,790
Nana Rose said it was a group of men.

592
00:31:57,793 --> 00:32:00,876
I mean, there was one photo
that I kind of remember.

593
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:04,004
Dad said it was taken after Grandpa
Louis and some of his friends

594
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:06,058
had planted some trees in Pickens Park.

595
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,274
Wait.

596
00:32:10,277 --> 00:32:11,671
Is this it?

597
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:13,773
Betty, look at the ground.

598
00:32:13,776 --> 00:32:15,296
That's where they buried the preacher.

599
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,433
Where Svenson could
be maybe still alive.

600
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:20,614
Yeah, look at the branches.

601
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:21,816
The Devil's Hand.

602
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:23,394
That tree's in Pickens Park.

603
00:32:25,752 --> 00:32:27,785
We'll call Sheriff Keller
on the way. Come on.

604
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:35,895
Look around. There.

605
00:32:44,606 --> 00:32:45,739
Yeah.

606
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,710
Oh, my God! Archie.

607
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:11,900
Where is Mr. Svenson?

608
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,437
Why would the Black Hood
bury an empty coffin?

609
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:20,407
What if it's a...

610
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:24,144
Get in the coffin.

611
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:30,129
No. No way.

612
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,387
Get in the coffin or I
shoot her in the head.

613
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:35,561
Right now!

614
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:49,676
Shut the coffin and
step out of the grave.

615
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,371
Betty, do it.

616
00:33:58,422 --> 00:33:59,688
I'm sorry.

617
00:34:04,786 --> 00:34:06,352
Pick up the shovel.

618
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:08,188
Fill in the grave.

619
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:11,758
Please don't.

620
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:24,304
We know what Mr. Svenson's sin is.

621
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:26,566
What he did.

622
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,275
That's the town's secret sin.

623
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:34,121
That's what you want revealed, right?

624
00:34:34,124 --> 00:34:37,295
We can do that. I can do that.

625
00:34:37,298 --> 00:34:40,831
Mr. Svenson, wherever he
is, he doesn't have to die.

626
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:43,920
Archie doesn't have to...

627
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,719
Archie.

628
00:34:55,722 --> 00:34:57,177
Where is he? Where did he go?

629
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,847
This way.

630
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,228
Hey!

631
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,242
Stop!

632
00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:20,613
Stop!

633
00:35:20,616 --> 00:35:22,136
Right the hell now!

634
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:26,191
Get down or I'll shoot you.
I swear to God, I'll do it!

635
00:35:26,194 --> 00:35:31,105
You tried to kill my
father and my friends.

636
00:35:31,108 --> 00:35:33,472
You are going to pay for your crimes.

637
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:36,707
You are not escaping. This ends tonight.

638
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,140
I said stop!

639
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,650
Archie, put the gun down.

640
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,111
- It's okay.
- Sheriff Keller.

641
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,489
Stay back, Betty.

642
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:02,785
He's dead.

643
00:36:03,979 --> 00:36:05,180
Who is he?

644
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,657
The town demanded blood for blood.

645
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,693
Give me the gun.

646
00:36:53,516 --> 00:36:56,116
Your instinct about
Svenson was right, Ronnie.

647
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,791
You thought he was the Black Hood.

648
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:02,129
We could have ended it, right there
at school where we confronted him.

649
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:05,290
I didn't see it. I didn't,
I didn't see it in his eyes.

650
00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:07,076
Forget his eyes.

651
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,703
I can't believe he
cut off his own finger.

652
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:11,538
The finger of accusation.

653
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,074
So we know whodunit.

654
00:37:14,843 --> 00:37:15,876
Why did he do it?

655
00:37:15,878 --> 00:37:19,154
Mr. Svenson accused an innocent man

656
00:37:19,157 --> 00:37:22,182
of murdering his family
and got the man killed.

657
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:24,051
So maybe, in some backwards way,

658
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:27,827
he thought targeting sinners
would balance the scales somehow.

659
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,889
I don't know.

660
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:30,524
No, no, it makes sense.

661
00:37:31,297 --> 00:37:35,555
I mean, Svenson was always
around, lurking in the hallways.

662
00:37:35,558 --> 00:37:38,625
He could have seen me and
Ms. Grundy in the music room.

663
00:37:38,628 --> 00:37:41,141
Yeah, he could have seen Moose
and Midge buying jingle-jangle.

664
00:37:41,144 --> 00:37:44,817
Guys, this is starting to feel like
that weird last scene in <i>Psycho.</i>

665
00:37:45,507 --> 00:37:46,673
The truth is...

666
00:37:52,181 --> 00:37:55,649
I have nothing actually.

667
00:37:56,618 --> 00:37:58,685
Except that he's in a
body bag and we aren't.

668
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:01,697

He dropped it off yesterday.

680
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,946
Let me guess that's from Betty.

Vintage Underwood.

682
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,461
It's the typewriter of champions.

You, too. I love you, too, Mom.

693
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:27,741
All right, here's Dad.

694
00:39:30,145 --> 00:39:31,278
Hey, there.

695
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,413
Merry Christmas, lady.

696
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:34,915
How are the Bahamas?

697
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:37,851
Hmm.

698
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,522
Hey.

699
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,292
Merry Christmas.

700
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:46,893
Look up.

701
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:48,495
Mistletoe alert.

702
00:39:48,498 --> 00:39:49,930
Hung by moi.

703
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:53,594
Now we have no choice but to kiss.

704
00:40:00,506 --> 00:40:01,872
Archie.

705
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:05,491
You are so good.

706
00:40:05,494 --> 00:40:07,888
It's like you are filled with it,

707
00:40:07,891 --> 00:40:12,085
and I know that I need
goodness in my life.

708
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:14,894
I need you in my life.

709
00:40:17,597 --> 00:40:18,863
In other words,

710
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:24,933
I love you, too, Archie Andrews.

711
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:46,819
And so, another mystery was wrapped up

712
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:48,355
in a neat, tidy bow,

713
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:51,110
just in time for Christmas.

714
00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:12,183
Throughout the Black
Hood's reign of terror,

715
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:14,961
Betty had stared into
the blackest of voids.

716
00:41:21,258 --> 00:41:25,292
The place where Joseph Conway's
soul had once, perhaps existed.

717
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:31,664
And in that void, she'd
seen a dark reflection,

718
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:34,868
a truth that could not be burned away.

719
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,102
A truth that whispered to her,

720
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:47,213
"This isn't over."
