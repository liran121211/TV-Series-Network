1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,335
Previously on Riverdale...

2
00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:03,642
We will not rest until those responsible

3
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:06,813
for the murder of our
sister is rightly punished.

4
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:07,981
Fangs...

5
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:11,216
Mrs. Klump, the Sheriff's department
is working around the clock...

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,945
You were supposed to be
protecting our children.

7
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:16,015
- What's all this?
- It's ransom money.

8
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:17,784
Not for Archie, I got him back.

9
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:19,828
This is from when I
turned the tables on Nick,

10
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:21,567
and held him for ransom instead.

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,411
I still haven't made my bones with you.

12
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:26,799
There's only one man I'm interested
in bringing down, the Black Hood.

13
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:30,304
And whatever I can do to help you
on your quest, you can count on me.

14
00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:32,156
This is the Black Hood speaking.

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,976
I got a letter. These symbols
look so familiar to me.

16
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:38,257
I used to check out
this book obsessively.

17
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,113
Betty, how could the
Black Hood know that?

18
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:41,648
Put it on.

19
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:43,257
Why are you doing this to me?

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,250
To show you that we're the same.

21
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:48,078
Where is he, Betty?
Where did you take Chic?

22
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,562
Did you kill my brother?

23
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:51,005
I didn't mean to hurt him.

24
00:00:51,695 --> 00:00:53,560
I'm gonna give you a head start.

25
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,852
Mom, where's dad?

26
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:08,398
- Hello.
- Hello, Sir.

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,281
I'm campaigning for
my dad, Fred Andrews.

28
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:12,712
He's running for Mayor of Riverdale
and could really use your vote.

29
00:01:12,714 --> 00:01:14,547
On the eve of the Mayoral Debate,

30
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,983
as Archie Andrews goes door-to-door,

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,632
he doesn't mention the murder
of his classmate, Midge Klump.

32
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:23,914
Excuse me, sir.

33
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,925
I'm campaigning for
my dad, Fred Andrews.

34
00:01:25,928 --> 00:01:27,494
I'm voting for Hiram Lodge.

35
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:29,163
Don't you mean Hermione Lodge?

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,062
Take the flyer, sir, in
case you change your mind.

37
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:34,093
Sure.

38
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:36,906
Most people believed Midge
was murdered by someone else

39
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:39,706
but not Archie.

40
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,208
He was certain, beyond
a shadow of a doubt,

41
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,743
the Black Hood was back,

42
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:46,579
as was his next-door
neighbor, Betty Cooper.

43
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:49,816
Who had, in fact, laid
eyes on the Black Hood

44
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,505
and suspected he was much closer.

45
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:55,355
Penny for your thoughts, hon?

46
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,827
I was thinking that he was a test.

47
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:03,463
Who was?

48
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:05,365
The impostor, Chic.

49
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:09,002
Everything that he did
to us and brought to us,

50
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,704
was kind of a test.

51
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:14,474
But we survived and
we're stronger for it.

52
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:16,262
Well, that remains to be seen.

53
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:18,356
No, Mom, we are.

54
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:21,328
And we'll survive
whatever else comes next.

55
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:28,087
You can't see my bruises anymore.

56
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:30,456
Yes, no reason whatsoever to bring up

57
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,326
Nick's failed attempt
to kidnap and murder you.

58
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:36,997
Speaking of, there is one
thing I wanted to tell you.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,128
What's that?

60
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:41,199
Word of my exploits
serving Nick his comeuppance

61
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,637
has seeped into the demimonde
of mobsters and molls

62
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,806
my father used to associate with,

63
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:50,361
so the five families are sending
their youngest and brightest

64
00:02:50,364 --> 00:02:52,045
their "princes," as it were

65
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,581
to, well, come court
the rare Mafia Princess

66
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,650
who can belly up to the
bar with the big boys.

67
00:02:57,652 --> 00:02:59,185
What do you mean, "Court"?

68
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:02,488
Thanks to my play, the families
are looking to make a business

69
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,124
and/or political
alliances with my parents.

70
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:07,226
It's all very Borgia-Medici.

71
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,729
Archie, if you have a moment?

72
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,531
Go ahead. We'll meet up at lunch,

73
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,866
after I welcome the tributes.

74
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,705
My spies tell me you're out
campaigning for your father.

75
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:21,274
I'm not campaigning, Mr. Lodge.

76
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:22,995
I'm trying to find the Black Hood.

77
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:26,370
It sounds insane, but
I remember his eyes.

78
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,120
So I'm going house-to-house to...

79
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:31,150
Stare into men's eyes?

80
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:34,019
Well, that sounds like looking
for a needle in a haystack,

81
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:36,823
but we don't even know if that
the needle is in the haystack.

82
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:39,592
You said you wanted to make
your bones. Is that still true?

83
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,730
- Yes.
- Well, then...

84
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:47,533
Why don't you reform your Dark Circle?

85
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:50,069
You'll want back-up should
you identify the Black Hood.

86
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:53,172
Reggie and the guys are
fired-up, Mr. Lodge, for sure,

87
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:57,143
but I need focused
lasers, not loose cannons.

88
00:03:57,146 --> 00:03:58,312
To help with that...

89
00:03:58,315 --> 00:04:01,261
A new Sheriff's taken over
for Keller, Michael Minetta.

90
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:04,565
A man I know very well. You could
coordinate your efforts with him.

91
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:05,839
- Really?
- Yes.

92
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:09,077
I'll arrange a meeting.
But move fast, Archie.

93
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,800
Every hour that passes, our killer
could be planning his next attack.

94
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:17,263
Any word from Chic?

95
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:21,500
No. He hasn't called since I
took him to the bus station.

96
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:24,437
So who knows? Maybe he's gone for good.

97
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,894
Hey, the silver lining to all this Chic

98
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:30,877
stuff over the last
couple of weeks is...

99
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,546
That's as bad as it gets, Betty.

100
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:35,481
It can't get worse, how could it?

101
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,800
My dad could be the Black Hood.

102
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:42,159
Yeah, okay. Well, that would be worse.

103
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:48,525
Well, well, well...

104
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,999
Aren't you boys a handsome
assortment of he-devils?

105
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:56,065
Veronica, these young men have
come to pay their respects.

106
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,668
Oh, I know why they're here, Mom.

107
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:00,905
And while I'm dying to hear
proposals, I'm already late for school.

108
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:02,841
But maybe I can squeeze you in tomorrow?

109
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,845
Uh... Tomorrow?

110
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,394
You do things your way,
Mom, I do things mine.

111
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:12,918
There's no one else that I can talk to.

112
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:15,955
No one else who might understand
what I'm going through.

113
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,112
Dear cousin, you look
harrowed. What is it?

114
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:22,523
Cheryl, before you saw
the video of your dad...

115
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:24,964
shooting Jason...

116
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:27,433
Did you know that he was the murderer?

117
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:30,903
Subconsciously, yes. Why do you ask?

118
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:35,775
I think there's a chance that my dad...

119
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,511
That somehow...

120
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:43,449
He might be the Black Hood.

121
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:49,362
Oh. Oh, Betty, I don't know.

122
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:52,391
I've seen your pater
sneak around Thistlehouse,

123
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,927
and he has all the stealth
of a marshmallow man.

124
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,730
Wherefore comes this accusation?

125
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,133
It's just intuition.

126
00:05:58,136 --> 00:06:00,499
Cheryl, I don't want
my dad to be a murderer.

127
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:02,534
It would destroy our lives even more,

128
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:05,004
but I don't know...

129
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:07,589
I can feel it in my bones...

130
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:12,168
If you're coming to me for advice, fine.

131
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,628
Let's get you to the Po-Po.

132
00:06:13,631 --> 00:06:15,305
Maybe this new Sheriff
has half a brain...

133
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,483
No. No. No. yet.

134
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:20,519
I need to be sure before
I involve anyone else.

135
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:22,121
Also, I know it's hard to explain,

136
00:06:22,123 --> 00:06:23,689
but if my dad is the Black Hood,

137
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:27,761
I need to be the one who
confronts him, who stops him.

138
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:32,440
In that case, absorb
my hard-learned advice.

139
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:35,200
You need concrete proof,
or a confession, or both.

140
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:37,425
First step? Buy yourself
time while you investigate.

141
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:39,261
That means pretending
everything is normal.

142
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:41,364
Yeah, well, luckily,
that's my specialty.

143
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:45,444
You're playing a very
dangerous game, Betty Cooper.

144
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:51,816
I don't think he would
hurt his own daughter.

145
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,808
And I never thought my dad would
shoot his son in the forehead,

146
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:58,624
but that's the world we live in.

147
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,883
Tread carefully, cousin.

148
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:11,237
You and Fred are neck-and-neck,

149
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:13,815
and with the town divided over
our prison, this debate is...

150
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:16,541
Is the single most important
event of the election.

151
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:18,628
I know. I know, basta.

152
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:20,912
We already control the Sheriff's
office, and The Register,

153
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:24,128
but we need the Mayor's office as
well, so the prison can't be blocked.

154
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:26,398
I'm hoping Archie's Dark
Circle will cause unrest.

155
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,653
After all, if Fred can't
control his own son,

156
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,658
he certainly can't control a town
on the verge of sliding into chaos.

157
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,922
If what happened to
Midge taught us anything,

158
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:39,130
it's that no one is safe, anywhere.

159
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,730
This town needs us, it
needs the Dark Circle.

160
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,773
And this time, we'll have
the new Sheriff's support.

161
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:46,007
- No offense, Kev.
- None taken.

162
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,940
Here to catch the guy
who cost my dad his job.

163
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:49,976
Guys, I... I gotta tell you something.

164
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,206
The night of the show, Midge and I got

165
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,748
into a fight backstage
cause she admitted,

166
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:56,615
she was seeing someone
else, behind my back.

167
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:58,017
- Who?
- Who?

168
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,052
She let it slip that it was a Serpent.

169
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:01,287
What?

170
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:06,959
I knew it, I knew it, the second
they set foot in this school!

171
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:10,628
Moose, why didn't you say
anything to us? Or my dad?

172
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:14,042
I didn't want to look like the jealous
boyfriend and have people think that I...

173
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:17,003
- We should talk to the new Sheriff...
- Screw that!

174
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:19,472
Some Serpent scumbag was doing Midge.

175
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:21,307
We just gotta figure out which one.

176
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,810
War Baby called my father
and I from Shankshaw.

177
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:27,747
Her old adversaries, the
Ghoulies, had been released.

178
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:29,949
Word on the street is that
they want Serpent blood.

179
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,409
They're gunning for a
re-match. They want war.

180
00:08:33,283 --> 00:08:35,512
Which one of you reptiles
was screwing Midge Klump?

181
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,644
What the hell is going on?
This is a private meeting.

182
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:40,180
I'm guessing it was you, Sweet Pea.

183
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:42,140
Reggie, that's enough.

184
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:44,180
You ass, I didn't even know Midge.

185
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:47,500
But yeah, I get why she wouldn't
want fleas from you mangy Bulldogs!

186
00:08:47,503 --> 00:08:49,435
- Reggie, no!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

187
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:51,303
Stop fighting now!

188
00:08:56,997 --> 00:09:00,122

189
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,903
So I've been thinking.

190
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:10,907
Dad, you've been so busy
at The Register lately.

191
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:12,675
Maybe Mom should go back to work.

192
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:16,380
I mean, she's moderating the debate,
why not report on it, as well?

193
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:20,394
I suppose it's not a terrible idea.

194
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:23,765
Yeah, and I could help, too, after
school with proofing and layout.

195
00:09:23,768 --> 00:09:26,369
My two best girls back at The Register?

196
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:31,661
It's bad, Jones. It's really bad.

197
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:32,996
So talk to me, Fangs.

198
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:35,231
On the opening night of
Carrie, when you were backstage

199
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:38,548
filming your documentary and you
found me in Midge's dressing room...

200
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:41,452
I wasn't just giving her notes...

201
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:43,840
You were hooking up.

202
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:46,419
And you didn't tell Sheriff Keller?

203
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,780
Jeez, Fangs, do you know how
guilty this makes you look?

204
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:52,250
I know! I know.

205
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,719
Did you do it?

206
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:58,721
Of course not.

207
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,357
- you've got to believe me, Jones!
- I do!

208
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,349
Can you delete the
footage off your camera?

209
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,879
I already gave the footage over
to Sheriff Keller as evidence.

210
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:08,146
- What do I do, Jones?
- Nothing.

211
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,896
Lay low. Serpents got your back.

212
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:13,069
I got your back.

213
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:22,638
Okay.

214
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:25,881
Canned meat isn't exactly sexy,
but it's making a comeback.

215
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:27,850
Tell your folks we should open a cannery

216
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:29,719
in that maple syrup
factory I saw on the river.

217
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:32,055
I only like my meat
free-range and grass-fed.

218
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:35,058
My family runs a five
thousand-seat arena in Pacific City.

219
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,814
They're looking to do the same
here. Do you have a favorite boxer?

220
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:39,862
Michelle Rodriguez Girlfight.

221
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:42,552
My family owns a track.

222
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:46,135
If you get your old man to invest with
my old man, I'll name a horse after you.

223
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:49,106
I want ships named after me, not horses.

224
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:54,210
We own and operate the largest chain
of casinos in the region, Ms. Lodge.

225
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:55,489
And we're looking to expand.

226
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:58,781
I'm not opposed to games of luck,
Elio. But are your dice loaded?

227
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,783
No. No need to be crooked.

228
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:03,886
Or haven't you heard?
The House always wins.

229
00:11:04,756 --> 00:11:06,689
Tell me more, Elio.

230
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:09,125
And it's Veronica, not "Ms. Lodge."

231
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,874
This is some pretty
forceful branding, Archie.

232
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:26,427
Reggie made those, not me.

233
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,728
I need your Dark Circle
to just lay off my Serpes.

234
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:31,748
Even though they were
technically right about something.

235
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,182
What do you mean?

236
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:35,852
One of my Serpents was
canoodling with Midge.

237
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:37,075
But he didn't kill her.

238
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:39,253
And I'm not gonna give you
his name so please don't ask.

239
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:42,592
But rest assured, none of my crew is a
middle-aged white guy with green eyes.

240
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:45,216
- And that's who you're still looking for, right?
- Yeah.

241
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:48,731
- I'll tell Reggie to lay off.
- Thank you.

242
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:52,130
In the meantime, I need
to get back some possibly

243
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,033
incriminating footage
from this new Sheriff.

244
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:55,619
Have you met him yet?

245
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:57,573
No. But do you mind if I tag along?

246
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:01,544
Gentlemen...

247
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:05,515
This is the young man I was
telling you about, Archie Andrews.

248
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,450
The one organizing
the safety initiative.

249
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:10,320
The Dark Circle. A
man after my own heart.

250
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:13,322
And this is the other one...

251
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:16,225
The muckraker.

252
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:18,294
The trouble maker.

253
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:20,356
You forgot iconoclast.

254
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,458
I was wondering if I
could have a word about

255
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:25,695
some documentary footage
that I lent your predecessor?

256
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,971
Sure. Let's chat in my office.

257
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:36,446
Hmm. Archie, Archie, Archie, Archie...

258
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:42,150
You said you wanted to introduce
me to Sheriff Minetta, Mr. Lodge,

259
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:44,320
so I took it upon myself to stop by.

260
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,857
Well, since you have so much free time,

261
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,259
Veronica may have mentioned
that she's entertaining

262
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:52,495
a young man from a
prominent family tonight.

263
00:12:52,497 --> 00:12:54,730
I'm hoping that you'll accompany them?

264
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,732
Absolutely, Mr. Lodge.

265
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,709
Out of all the offers on the table,
Elio, yours inspired me the most.

266
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:11,533
So what if our families were to partner
up for say, "The Sweetwater Casino"?

267
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:14,082
Nothing would make my father happier.

268
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,418
Perfection.

269
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,356
Now, play nice, boys,
while I go powder my nose.

270
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:33,957
How'd you get in with the Lodges?

271
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:38,508
I'm mostly just with Veronica.

272
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,409
My dad says you're one of Hiram's capos,

273
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:42,745
that you made your bones
taking care of Papa Poutine?

274
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:45,205
No, that wasn't me.

275
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,284
Word is, Papa Poutine's son,
Small Fry is looking for payback.

276
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,520
No one in Riverdale had
anything to do with that.

277
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:59,922
You sure you don't want to take a
break and join us for dinner, honey?

278
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:02,932
I'm not hungry right now. Will you get
me a tomato bisque for later though?

279
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:07,064
- Okay.
- And maybe, an Orange Freeze?

280
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:08,638
Sounds great, Dad.

281
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:37,700
I got into my dad's planner.
And cross-referenced the dates

282
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:41,337
of every Black Hood attack with
his schedule, and they all line up.

283
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,888
Okay. "Worked late" the night
Midge and Moose were attacked.

284
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:47,276
"Early meeting" the
morning Fred was shot.

285
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:49,745
"Business trip" the night
Ms. Grundy was killed.

286
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:51,614
Business trip to Greendale, no doubt.

287
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:53,949
This isn't proof, but
this is corroboration.

288
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:02,451
Register.

289
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:06,128
Mrs. Cooper, this is Dr. Curdle
from the coroner's office.

290
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,630
How...

291
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,466
How can I help you?

292
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:12,401
I have a warm body for you.

293
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:14,637
Unidentified male, mid-20s.

294
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,874
His body turned up off the highway,
just outside town, mutilated.

295
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:24,096
Mrs. Cooper. Are you there?

296
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,414
Yes.

297
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:29,371
Yes, I'll come... I'll come by
to see it. Thank you, Dr. Curdle.

298
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:32,054
As always, small bills are preferable.

299
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:38,227
- We have to go to the morgue.
- Why?

300
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,129
Another Black Hood victim?

301
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:42,552
I sent The Black Hood after Chic.

302
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,303
I gave Chic a head start and told him
to run, but maybe he didn't make it.

303
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:56,212
Sheriff Minetta wouldn't
give me back my footage.

304
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:58,714
Says he wants to go
through it frame by frame.

305
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:00,367
It's only a matter
of time before he puts

306
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,018
two and two together
and brings Fangs in.

307
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,321
Damn it. Of all the
girls in Riverdale High...

308
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:07,623
What do I do?

309
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,626
If Fangs runs, he looks guilty.

310
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:13,529
If he's caught withholding the
truth, he'll look like the killer.

311
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:18,234
It's a perfect storm.

312
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:20,302
The Lodges endorsed this new Sheriff.

313
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:21,671
They want Midge's killer caught

314
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:23,539
and if it's a Southsider,
so much the better.

315
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,307
Then we hunker down...

316
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:29,245
Get ready to fight.

317
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:41,357
Dad?

318
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,363
What are you still doing up?

319
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:50,507
I got this note.

320
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,265
- _
- Pinned to the front door.

321
00:16:52,268 --> 00:16:55,437
I can only assume it's from
our old pal, the Black Hood.

322
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:03,272
It's clear what has to be
done. We cancel the debate.

323
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,040
Prank or not, it's
not a risk we can take.

324
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:07,548
I agree. Until the Black Hood's
caught, we have to be careful.

325
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:09,485
Can you beef up security
at the Town Hall?

326
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,399
- Fred, honestly...
- Dad, you can't be serious.

327
00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:13,407
We'll lock Town Hall down
tighter than a steel drum.

328
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:16,211
The town is scared. They need
to be shown we can't be cowed.

329
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:20,358
Well, if Fred's in, so are we.

330
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:27,302
You're not the Mrs.
Cooper I was expecting.

331
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,839
Yeah, well. My money's
good just the same.

332
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,871
This poor creature
was found in the men's

333
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:43,087
room at the rest stop
outside of Greendale.

334
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:02,656
Betty, it's okay, it wasn't Chic.

335
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:04,492
But it could have been.

336
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:07,826
Chic is probably out there, with
a bullet in his forehead or...

337
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:11,232
Or he got away, and he's on
a train back to Transylvania.

338
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:15,903
I delivered him to the Black Hood,
Cheryl. That makes me a murderer.

339
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:18,739
I've been trying to prove
that my dad's a killer,

340
00:18:18,742 --> 00:18:21,009
when really, all I have to
do was look in the mirror.

341
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:22,710
Oh, God!

342
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,946
He got what he wanted.

343
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:27,115
We're the same.

344
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:31,252
None of this is your fault, Betty.

345
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:34,455
Part of me wanted to
punish Chic for what he did.

346
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:38,593
If Chic is dead, that's a
psycho's doing, not yours.

347
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:40,928
I don't know how much
longer I can keep going

348
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,297
before I snap and say something.

349
00:18:44,768 --> 00:18:46,467
I think you should say something.

350
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:49,303
I think you need to confront your father

351
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:51,873
with as much of the truth as you dare,

352
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:54,238
and see how he reacts.

353
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:05,353
I have something to confess.

354
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:10,858
Well, what is it, honey?

355
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:18,239
While the Black Hood was
first hurting people...

356
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:22,860
He was also calling me,

357
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:24,605
asking me to do things.

358
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:27,341
He said I was like him.

359
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:30,770
He offered to help me get rid of Chic.

360
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:35,356
So I delivered Chic to the Black Hood.

361
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:40,488
If he's dead,

362
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:44,892
that makes me an accomplice to murder.

363
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:50,298
And I think...

364
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:53,236
I'm okay with that.

365
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:58,072
The truth is, there's always
been this darkness inside of me...

366
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,494
I thought Chic could help me
understand it, but really...

367
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:09,550
It was the Black Hood who did.

368
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,088
Honey...

369
00:20:17,193 --> 00:20:19,126
I don't know what to say.

370
00:20:22,632 --> 00:20:23,965
Betty...

371
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,051
I experience it, too,

372
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:30,420
the darkness.

373
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:34,175
When I was away from you and your mom,

374
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:38,592
I felt like I was drowning in it...

375
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,968
It's why we need each other.

376
00:20:55,365 --> 00:20:58,199
- Jug, did you see it?
- See what?

377
00:20:58,202 --> 00:21:01,004
Fangs was dating Midge and
didn't tell Sheriff Keller.

378
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:02,488
Where'd you get that video?

379
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:04,938
It was posted on The Register's
website, somebody leaked it.

380
00:21:04,941 --> 00:21:06,841
It makes Fangs look guilty as sin.

381
00:21:06,843 --> 00:21:09,399
Attention, students. This
is Principal Weatherbee.

382
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:12,213
I need Fangs Fogarty to come
to my office immediately.

383
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:13,514
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

384
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:15,550
We have to find him before
the Dark Circle does.

385
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:17,412
What the hell?

386
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:19,191
That video's everywhere!
How did it get out?

387
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,567
We have to get you
out of here, all right?

388
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:22,332
You're dead, Vixen killer!

389
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:24,215
- This way...
- Mr. Fogarty!

390
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:27,682
- We need you to come with us.
- I didn't do anything.

391
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:32,466
Okay, okay. Come on, come on. Hey, hey!

392
00:21:40,076 --> 00:21:43,811
I know today is all about
the debate, but I was curious.

393
00:21:43,814 --> 00:21:45,576
Did you get my proposal?

394
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:48,815
About partnering with Elio's
family on a modestly-sized casino?

395
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:50,318
I did, yes.

396
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,953
But no business Elio's
family runs is legal.

397
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:56,524
Their casinos are just fronts
for numerous criminal activities.

398
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:59,026
No, no, Daddy, Elio assured me...

399
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:01,495
This partnership just
doesn't make sense for us.

400
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:05,032
Not now, not when we're on the
verge of coming out of the shadows

401
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:07,068
and into the light, ourselves.

402
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:09,503
Surely, you understand that?

403
00:22:18,282 --> 00:22:21,671
You don't have to do that.
There's a deputy out there.

404
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,518
What if the deputy falls asleep?
And the Black Hood slips past him?

405
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:29,824
- What if I can't stop him again?
- Again?

406
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,529
Look, Archie, what happened at Pop's...

407
00:22:31,532 --> 00:22:32,876
Changed everything, Dad.

408
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:38,381
I really thought you were
going to die, Dad. I felt...

409
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,969
Helpless.

410
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:44,709
Everything broke that day, and I've been

411
00:22:44,712 --> 00:22:46,728
trying to put it back
together ever since.

412
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:51,327
- First with the Red Circle and then...
- Hiram Lodge.

413
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,023
Is that what this is about?

414
00:22:55,026 --> 00:22:58,886
You backing him? Working
for him? He makes you feel...

415
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:02,156
I just hate feeling
like I can't do anything.

416
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:04,076
I know you do, son.

417
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,167
Especially when it seems like
the whole world is on fire.

418
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,513
All right, War Dogs.

419
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,612
Let's have some fun.

420
00:23:29,686 --> 00:23:30,918
Whoo!

421
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:45,575
Jug, what's up?

422
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:47,408
You and your Dark Circle went wilding on

423
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:49,371
the Southside last
night, that's what's up!

424
00:23:49,374 --> 00:23:51,274
Wait, hold on. That...
That's impossible.

425
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:54,377
Unless it was some other vigilante
group in letterman jackets

426
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:58,018
who set a dumpster on
fire and slashed our tires!

427
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,949
Archie, Hog Eye saw you guys!

428
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:02,552
Jug, I swear, I don't
know anything about this.

429
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:04,670
- I wasn't there.
- Jughead?

430
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:06,373
- Attorney McCoy.
- Where is he?

431
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:12,162
You were in Midge Klump's
dressing room doing what, exactly?

432
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:14,731
We were just talking. I didn't kill her.

433
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:17,076
Didn't you? With this knife
you had on your person?

434
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,335
Don't say another word.

435
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:21,371
I'll be representing Mr.
Fogarty from here on out

436
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:24,641
and I'd appreciate it, if
you'd stop harassing my client.

437
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:30,444
You're being held because you were in

438
00:24:30,447 --> 00:24:32,515
possession of a weapon
on school property.

439
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:34,651
- My switch-blade's for protection.
- Yes.

440
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:36,786
Well, they have 24 hours
to make something stick.

441
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:41,691
In the meantime, you exercise your
right to remain the hell silent.

442
00:24:45,629 --> 00:24:48,997
Have you guys lost your minds?
Vandalizing the Southside?

443
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,667
We were celebrating Fangs' arrest.

444
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:53,503
That's not something to celebrate,
you idiot! He didn't do it.

445
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:55,171
Archie, he had a knife on him.

446
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:57,140
Okay, we're not having
this argument, you guys.

447
00:24:57,142 --> 00:24:59,008
The Circle is officially disbanded.

448
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,010
That's not your decision to make, dude.

449
00:25:01,012 --> 00:25:03,379
You're not the one paying us. Hiram is.

450
00:25:04,382 --> 00:25:05,682
Wait...

451
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:12,589
- Mr. Lodge is paying you?
- Yeah.

452
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:16,459
He's the one that suggested we
go out and have a little fun.

453
00:25:16,468 --> 00:25:20,303
Said you might've started the
Dark Circle, but it was mine now.

454
00:25:20,306 --> 00:25:23,099
Veronica, I'm afraid I've already taken

455
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:25,068
on my pro bono case for the week.

456
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:29,539
That should cover an hour
of legal advice, I hope.

457
00:25:31,977 --> 00:25:33,476
What can I do for you?

458
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:37,313
Let's say someone wanted to
open a casino in Riverdale.

459
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:39,716
For starters, they'd
need a gaming license.

460
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:42,506
Which are difficult to obtain without...

461
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:45,622
Connections.

462
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:48,892
Let's say one wanted to do
this, strictly above board.

463
00:26:01,873 --> 00:26:03,638
- Has he confessed yet?
- No.

464
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:05,384
But he said something about not being

465
00:26:05,387 --> 00:26:07,370
his best self when
my mom kicked him out.

466
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:10,480
And it was just a hunch, but I
got into his credit card statements

467
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:13,483
and he's still making weekly
payments to the ShareBnB

468
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:15,618
he'd been renting even
though he's back at home.

469
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,229
Do you think it's his
serial killer lair?

470
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:19,209
And please tell me we're breaking in.

471
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:41,711
What are we looking for, exactly?

472
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:43,413
Trophies from his victims?

473
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:48,017
Or just anything
unusual or incriminating.

474
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,586
Hmm.

475
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:54,991
Betty?

476
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:58,661
Does your father have an
affinity for kiddie lit,

477
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:00,763
or would this be considered unusual?

478
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:05,368
Cheryl...

479
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:10,340
The Black Hood used this
book to write the cipher,

480
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:12,242
the cipher that only I could solve.

481
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:15,445
My dad knew I was obsessed
with this book, growing up.

482
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:22,018
- Oh, my God! It's him.
- Don't answer it.

483
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:24,605
- Hi, Dad.
- Betty, where are you?

484
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:27,155
Um, I'm at Pop's with Cheryl.

485
00:27:27,158 --> 00:27:29,726
Well, your mom and I are
about to head to the debate.

486
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:31,394
You want us to wait? Or pick you up?

487
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:33,763
No, just go ahead. We'll meet you there.

488
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:46,276
Daddy, I've done a little
research, and I've figured out how

489
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:49,245
we can make the casino happen
without involving Elio's family.

490
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:51,748
- And it's legal, like you asked.
- I didn't ask.

491
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:54,105
And we're moments away
from your mother's debate,

492
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:55,708
so if can we table this?

493
00:27:57,021 --> 00:28:00,088
Welcome, one and all, to
tonight's Mayoral Debate.

494
00:28:06,364 --> 00:28:10,461
Jumping right in. Fear and
unrest rule the streets.

495
00:28:10,464 --> 00:28:14,103
Hermione Lodge, how would you
restore safety to the town?

496
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:16,606
Well, we're already
making strides, Alice.

497
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:19,575
My husband and I personally recruited

498
00:28:19,577 --> 00:28:23,346
Sheriff Minetta from Centerville
after Tom Keller resigned.

499
00:28:23,348 --> 00:28:28,151
Not one week on the job, and he's
apprehended Midge Klump's murderer.

500
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:33,323
Fred? Rebuttal?

501
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:34,891
We don't know if he's the killer.

502
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,633
All I'm saying is let's not call
for blood until we've had a trial.

503
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:48,886
What does that say about
us, about Riverdale?

504
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:52,275
You talk about not
calling for blood, Fred?

505
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:55,378
Are you aware of a group
called the Dark Circle?

506
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,647
- No, I'm not.
- Then let me enlighten you.

507
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:01,417
The Dark Circle is a
dangerous, radical group

508
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:05,321
that traffics in terror,
violence and street-warfare.

509
00:29:05,324 --> 00:29:06,472
It's a group...

510
00:29:07,892 --> 00:29:10,893
started by your son, Archie.

511
00:29:13,965 --> 00:29:16,152
Now I ask you, Citizens of Riverdale...

512
00:29:16,573 --> 00:29:19,535
How can we trust a man to run a town

513
00:29:19,537 --> 00:29:21,671
when he can't even keep
his own house in order?

514
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,175
Oh, my God! It's the Black Hood!

515
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:30,747
Dad?

516
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:33,683
Mom?

517
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:38,788
- Betty!
- Dad?

518
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:46,394
- Are you hurt, son?
- Dad, are you okay?

519
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:51,658
Excuse me. Thank you.

520
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,313
I guess Sheriff Keller's not
looking so bad right about now, huh?

521
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:59,183
There's a trapdoor leading
from the balcony to the roof

522
00:29:59,185 --> 00:30:02,687
that's not on any building plans.
But I've got cars all over downtown.

523
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:04,656
He's not gonna get far,
we'll catch him tonight.

524
00:30:04,658 --> 00:30:06,257
Sheriff, if I may?

525
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:08,526
Archie's come face-to-face
with the Black Hood before,

526
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:11,162
looked him in the eyes. Maybe
he could help identify him.

527
00:30:11,164 --> 00:30:12,563
You up for a ride-along?

528
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:22,106
Actually, I'm gonna head
home, stay with my dad.

529
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:23,942
Make sure he's safe there.

530
00:30:25,546 --> 00:30:27,079
Yeah...

531
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:29,314
All right, then.

532
00:30:38,992 --> 00:30:40,625
I just got off the phone with Betty.

533
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:42,393
Apparently, the Black Hood
just turned the town hall

534
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:44,729
into his own shooting gallery,
while Fangs was right here.

535
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:46,331
So why is the Sheriff still holding him?

536
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,405
What happened tonight
and what happened to Midge

537
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:50,902
are being treated as separate incidents.

538
00:30:50,904 --> 00:30:55,073
But if the Sheriff doesn't press charges
in the next hour, he has to let you go.

539
00:30:55,075 --> 00:30:57,803
There are lots of
protesters outside, Jughead.

540
00:30:57,806 --> 00:31:02,146
His release is going to make a lot
of people in this town very unhappy.

541
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:10,650
Mom,

542
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:12,256
you're shaking.

543
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:15,541
I'm fine.

544
00:31:15,544 --> 00:31:18,329
Look, I know you want to
be strong for the campaign,

545
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:21,566
but if tonight was any
indication of what's to come,

546
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:25,076
maybe you should drop out of the race.

547
00:31:25,872 --> 00:31:27,338
Nobody's withdrawing, Mija.

548
00:31:28,074 --> 00:31:29,528
Daddy, are you serious?

549
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:32,175
We've worked too hard on these
plans. We can't get skittish now.

550
00:31:32,178 --> 00:31:35,346
A serial killer just played
target practice with mom!

551
00:31:35,348 --> 00:31:37,949
Your father's right, Veronica.

552
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:41,085
This campaign is bigger
than what happened tonight.

553
00:31:42,388 --> 00:31:43,787
I'll be fine.

554
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,658
He's willing to put your
life in jeopardy and for what?

555
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,795
His plan, his vision, his decisions.

556
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:52,730
You will show me respect in this house.

557
00:31:52,732 --> 00:31:54,532
Like the respect you showed me?

558
00:31:54,535 --> 00:31:57,568
When you asked me to entertain
the sons of your enemies?

559
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,719
Or the respect when I
tried to tell you that

560
00:31:59,722 --> 00:32:01,773
I'd worked everything
out with the casino?

561
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:05,443
And you brushed me aside! Well,
guess what, I'm going ahead with it.

562
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:08,880
I've done the work and I have the money.

563
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,698
Oh, you mean the money that you
swindled from the St. Clairs?

564
00:32:14,177 --> 00:32:18,089
Do you think I'd let my daughter keep
a pile of cash like that lying around?

565
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:22,693
I put it in a trust that you won't
be able to touch until you're 21,

566
00:32:22,696 --> 00:32:26,531
when hopefully, you'll be
more rational and clear-minded.

567
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,919
Honey, I'm going to meet
your mom down at The Register.

568
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,122
Actually, Dad, I need to
talk to you about something.

569
00:32:48,655 --> 00:32:50,088
I don't know...

570
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,885
What I saw at the Town Hall, if
that was really the Black Hood...

571
00:32:58,924 --> 00:33:03,126
Cheryl and I went to your
ShareBnB and broke-in.

572
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:08,172
You and Cheryl?

573
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:10,141
And I found this book

574
00:33:10,143 --> 00:33:13,444
that the Black Hood used for
his cipher all those months ago.

575
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:14,712
Why do you have it?

576
00:33:14,714 --> 00:33:17,815
I had no idea that the
Black Hood used that book.

577
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:21,319
All I knew was it was your favorite.

578
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:24,322
You checked it out of the
library practically every weekend.

579
00:33:24,324 --> 00:33:27,592
I found a copy online and I
was saving it for your birthday.

580
00:33:30,163 --> 00:33:32,230
What? What are you talking about?

581
00:33:35,602 --> 00:33:37,535
You didn't think that...

582
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,140
- Oh, Betty...
- Wait, wait. So...

583
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:47,745
This book is really just a present?

584
00:33:47,748 --> 00:33:48,946
For me?

585
00:33:48,948 --> 00:33:50,882
Of course, Betty.

586
00:33:53,654 --> 00:33:55,216
What else would it be?

587
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,759
Dad, I just got back from
the Sheriff's station.

588
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:03,294
Fangs is getting out tonight.

589
00:34:05,732 --> 00:34:07,632
Joaquin?

590
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:09,700
What's he doing here?

591
00:34:09,702 --> 00:34:12,872
I called him. He's going
to help Fangs disappear.

592
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:16,075
I can sneak him out to San
Junipero. I got a place there.

593
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:18,517
Maybe. But first, we need to get him out

594
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,278
of that Sheriff's station in one piece.

595
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,686
There's an angry mob outside with

596
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:23,550
pitchforks and they're
yelling for his head!

597
00:34:26,336 --> 00:34:28,456
Something's happening,
and it's gonna make you

598
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,490
and the rest of the
Dark Circle very angry

599
00:34:32,493 --> 00:34:33,826
and frustrated.

600
00:34:37,464 --> 00:34:39,064
Fangs Fogarty

601
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:41,603
is being released.

602
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:43,734
- What?
- Sometime after midnight.

603
00:34:43,737 --> 00:34:46,564
But there's nothing you
or I can do about it.

604
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:54,312
Short of taking justice
into your own hands.

605
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:57,180
We must have faith
in the justice system,

606
00:34:57,183 --> 00:35:00,451
even if it sometimes allows the guilty

607
00:35:01,454 --> 00:35:03,087
to walk free.

608
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:11,067
- Ronnie, what's up?
- I came here to see your dad.

609
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,830
Is everything okay?

610
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:15,400
Everything's fine,
Mr. Andrews. I just...

611
00:35:16,504 --> 00:35:20,403
I wanted to tell you that from now
on, I'm supporting your run for Mayor.

612
00:35:20,406 --> 00:35:22,173
I can't in good conscience

613
00:35:22,175 --> 00:35:25,376
stand with my father
anymore. I believe in you.

614
00:36:59,706 --> 00:37:02,473
Betty, is everything okay?

615
00:37:03,076 --> 00:37:04,442
Dad?

616
00:37:06,946 --> 00:37:10,414
I think we need to finish the
conversation we started earlier.

617
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:17,121
- Should I come home, Betty?
- No.

618
00:37:19,425 --> 00:37:22,226
Meet me at the place
where this all began.

619
00:37:22,229 --> 00:37:24,729
With my speech at Town Hall.

620
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:27,169
You understand?

621
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:29,500
Of course.

622
00:37:29,502 --> 00:37:31,769
I want it to just be between you and me.

623
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,251
Just how you wanted
it from the beginning.

624
00:37:37,043 --> 00:37:38,576
Just like...

625
00:37:40,213 --> 00:37:41,679
It's supposed to be.

626
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:55,269
Archie, you gotta get down
here. I'm down at the station...

627
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,971
Jug, slow down, I can't hear you.

628
00:37:56,973 --> 00:37:59,274
I said, get your ass down
to the Sheriff's station.

629
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:01,442
Your guys are here and
they're out of control.

630
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:03,772
Oh, you mean the Dark Circle?
They're not my guys anymore.

631
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:06,014
Well, they want to rip Fangs apart.

632
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:08,583
He's getting out and we need
your help, Archie, please!

633
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:15,723
Justice for Midge! Justice for Midge!

634
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:20,428
Free Fangs! Free Fangs! Free Fangs!

635
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:45,556
Okay, Dad. Let's talk.

636
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:48,946
You can't take Fangs out the front.
We have to take the side entrance.

637
00:38:48,948 --> 00:38:51,481
Crowd's out there, too. So
pick your poison, Serpent.

638
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:55,930
- What do we do, man?
- I don't wanna die.

639
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:01,475
Fangs, you're not going to.

640
00:39:01,478 --> 00:39:03,438
Look at me, okay?

641
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:07,075
We stand together so none of us falls.

642
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:08,810
In unity, there is strength.

643
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:12,013
In unity, there is strength!

644
00:40:58,221 --> 00:41:00,054
No!

645
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,385
I swear, Mother, if this is
one of your gentlemen callers...

646
